   Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich entered
the 1990 governor's race Thursday, promising Ohio the same
leadership that he said made Cleveland a municipal success story
over the past decade.
   ``Cleveland is off of the rocks and on a roll. Our neighborhoods
are better, our jobs are up and the jokes are down,'' said
Voinovich, an unsuccesful 1988 Republican U.S. Senate candidate,
one-time lieutenant governor, former state representative and
Cuyahoga County auditor.
   Voinovich, 52, brushed aside questions about his defeat in the
Sentate race last year by Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, whom
Voinovich accused during the campaign of being soft on child
pornography.
   Ohio's Democratic Chairman, James Ruvolo, revived past
complaints of negative campaigning by Voinovich against Metzenbaum
last fall and said he wishes the mayor ``the same success he had
last year.''
   Gov. Richard Celeste, a Democrat, is barred by the state
constitution from seeking a third consecutive term.

<HEAD>Report: Iraq Downed Egyptian Jet By Mistake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iraqi soldier shot down an Egyptian jet
fighter by mistake last week as it descended to land in Baghdad for
an air show, a published report here said.
   The two Egyptian fliers ejected safely before the plane crashed,
The Washington Post reported in Friday's editions.
   The Iraqi government had invited Egypt to fly its home-built
Alpha fighter-bomber to Baghdad for the air show, but apparently
word of the invitation had not reached the soldier who, armed with
shoulder-fired missile, downed the unfamiliar jet, the Post said.
   The newspaper cited secret intelligence reports making the
rounds of U.S. government offices here as the source of the story.
   The Alpha jet was developed by French and German aircraft firms.
Egypt has purchased Alpha kits from France and assembles the
fighter-bomber in a plant south of Cairo. The jet has a top speed
of 600 mph.
   Two years ago, in another case of mistaken identity, an Iraqi
pilot in a Mirage F1 bomber shot two Exocet missiles into the USS
Stark, killing 37 sailors aboard the U.S. frigate in the Persian
Gulf. Iraqi officials said the pilot mistook the U.S. ship for an
Iranian vessel.
   Also, the USS Vincennes downed an Iranian Airbus on July 3,
1988, killing 290 people, as it flew over the Persian Gulf where
U.S. ships were protecting neutral ships during the Iran-Iraq war.
The United States said it attempted repeatedly to contact the plane
for identification, and when it got no response, the Vincennes
destroyed the plane with a surface-to-air missile.

   The miniseries comes to ``Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood'' next week, and the show's cardigan-clad creator
promises a message as gentle and reassuring as ever.
   The three-part musical, titled ``Josephine the Short-Neck
Giraffe,'' tells the story of a young giraffe who yearns for a
long, graceful neck like all the other giraffes. She eventually
grows, Fred Rogers confided, ``not on the outside, but on the
important side.''
   ``It's very much like the usual message of the Neighborhood,
that you can be acceptable as you are,'' he said, smiling. ``It's
not so much the outsides of us that are important.''
   A song sung by Josephine and her friend Hazel the elephant sums
it up best, according to Rogers.
   ``You're much more than a neck, Josephine. And you're much more
than a trunk, Hazel. A chicken's more than a peck, and there's more
than a smell to a skunk,'' Rogers quietly sang during an interview
at Pittsburgh's WQED-TV, home to his children's programs for the
past 35 years.
   The special week of new programs gets under way Monday on Public
Broadcasting Service stations with a trip to the San Diego Wild
Animal Park, where viewers are introduced to real-life giraffes and
elephants. On Tuesday, Rogers visits a film processing lab to have
his animal photographs developed.
   The miniseries, which features a cast of 15, elaborate animal
costumes and five sets, runs Wednesday through Friday. Rogers
gently guides his young audience from one day to the next,
summarizing the main events and hinting at what might lie ahead for
Josephine.
   In the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, where animals sing, dance
and play the trombone, Josephine is befriended by J.R., a shy
giraffe who overcomes his problems by helping Josephine conquer
hers. He accomplishes that with help from Hazel the elephant, who
advises him to ``just let your heart speak.''
   ``There isn't a time that I see the scene in which J.R. talks
and sings with Josephine ... that I haven't gotten chills up my
spine,'' Rogers said, tapping his right hand against his back.
``And this is something I've worked with for years. There's
something so redemptive about someone who is trying so hard to help
somebody else.''
   Rogers, 61, wrote ``Josephine the Short-Neck Giraffe'' for a
French class assignment at Florida's Rollins College in 1950. He
named J.R. the giraffe after fraternity brother John Reardon, who
went on to sing with the Metropolitan Opera and was a frequent
guest on ``Mister Rogers Neighborhood.'' Reardon died a year ago,
and the miniseries is dedicated to him.
   Rogers set the story to music in the late 1950s, and about 1,000
records were pressed. Writer Barry Head transformed ``Josephine the
Short-Neck Giraffe'' into a poem for children in 1975.
   For years, Rogers tried to have the musical produced on stage or
as an animated film.
   ``I still think it would be great for animation and a stage
production,'' he said. ``But I thought unless we get it out on the
air, I don't think anybody's going to know about it.''
   The story Rogers wrote 39 years ago is vastly different from the
musical airing next week. It is the Neighborhood's 13th musical.
   ``At the end of the (original) story, when people are telling
Josephine that they like her just the way she is, she raises her
head to look at them because she hasn't really heard this message
before and her neck starts to grow. And it grows and grows and
grows until her neck is as tall as everybody else's,'' Rogers said.
   In the musical, Josephine's neck remains short.
   ``I think it shows how much we've grown,'' Rogers said. ``You
know, you don't have to look like everybody else to be acceptable
and to feel acceptable. And wishes don't always come true.
   ``Because for a year and a day I've been wishing, she sang. That
was one of her first songs. Her wish was for a longer neck, she
thought. But really her wish was to have people like her exactly as
she is. So often what we say we're wishing for isn't necessarily
what is behind the wish. This is very philosophical.''
   Will pre-schoolers be able to grasp such a serious message, even
in such a light-hearted setting?
   ``Maybe not in words, but let their hearts speak to them the way
Hazel said to J.R., `Just let your heart speak,''' Rogers said. ``I
think that that's the way an awful lot of communication takes
place.''

   ``Frere Jacques'' never sounded so revolutionary.
   ``Lying to the people, lying to the people, very strange, very
strange,'' hundreds of students sang in place of the usual lyrics
of the French children's song.
   Unlike American anti-Vietnam War marchers of the 1960s, who were
serenaded by a generation of rock and folk singers, thousands of
Chinese students who marched for democracy have a limited
repertoire of marching songs. Most of the time they stick to the
national anthem, with its stirring call to the masses to ``arise,''
or the Internationale, the theme song of the international
communist movement.
   But they mix it up a bit with ``Frere Jacques'' and the nursery
rhyme ``Baa Baa Black Sheep.''
   Only the words were different.
   ``We didn't have time to write our own songs,'' said one student
leader. ``Besides, it's easier to sing when you know the tune.''

   Police kept their cool but some lost their hats and shoes in
skirmishes with students who pushed through their lines toward
Tiananmen Square.
   When the dust settled after the students pushed through the
first line of police, one officer was seen wandering around in his
socks, wailing, ``My shoes, my shoes.''
   An old woman finally found one of his black cloth shoes and
returned it. A student later produced another.
   In the final standoff before students surged into Tiananmen
Square, one worker snatched the hat off an officer's head and
tossed it into the crowd. Someone caught it and tossed it back like
a frisbee.
   The officer's arms were linked with his comrades to form a human
barricade, so a student politely plunked it back on the policeman's
head.

<TEXT>
   The United States is a model to many of the students.
   One student described Hu Yaobang, the ousted Communist Party
leader whose death sparked the recent protests, as ``China's George
Washington.''
   Another said American student protests in the 1960s against the
Vietnam War inspired him and his classmates to take to the streets,
despite the fact that the United States at that time was China's
Enemy No. 1.
   The question most often asked by students was: ``Don't American
students demonstrate, too?''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The first thing the people noticed was the tinkling of a bell,
then a shaved head and finally a gray robe.
   A Buddhist monk had come to the demonstration.
   Walking slowly, shaking his prayer bell, the monk blessed the
crowd, which parted before him.
   ``I feel in my heart for you, all of us support you,'' he said.
   ``Religion has suffered much in this country. I had to thank you
for supporting freedom.''

   Many of the bystanders carried cameras, anxious for souvenirs of
the rare day. But good views were hard to get in the constantly
moving crowd, forcing some dedicated photographers to climb trees
and bus stop signs. One middle-aged man handed his camera to a
youth standing on a bicycle and pleaded with him to ``snap the
whole roll.''
   The roof of one shanty crumbled under the weight of camera-happy
spectators and they came crashing down in a cloud of dust. The
crowd roared with laughter and nobody seemed hurt.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Most of the police who withdrew in the face of the huge,
insistent crowd did so gracefully.
   About 50 police who had been roughly pushing back bystanders on
a side street abruptly formed a line and trotted off down the
street. The crowd shouted, ``Thank you'' and surged forward.
   A few traffic police caught up in the melee simply took off
their uniform white cross-chest straps and belts, climbed over a
fence and melted into the crowd.
   Other police crouched on their haunches at the side of the road,
heads in their hands, and smiled wearily as the crowd passed.

<HEAD>What Makes a Successful Entreprenuer? MIT Just Might Know</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What makes a successful entreprenuer? A
recent Massachusetts Institute of Technology survey reports that
many are immigrants, the offspring of self-employed parents and
hold advanced degrees.
   The survey of 99 MIT graduates who will be honored by the
university Saturday night provides some insight into the men and
women who give upthe security of a salary to take a chance on their
own business.
   As part of the institute's 128th anniversary, it will honor the
99 sociology consultants, financial managers and computer
technicians for their ``hard work, foresight and courage.''
   Collectively, they have created 100,000 jobs in the state and
250,000 worldwide in fields that range from women's apparel to
geotechnical engineering. The cumulative sales of their companies
total $25 billion annually.
   According to the survey, 73 percent earned an educational degree
above the bachelor level, and 33 percent went on to doctorate or
post-doctorate work.
   Sixteen percent founded their companies while they were still at
school, 34 percent set up shop within five years of graduating and
23 percent opened for business between six years and 10 years after
graduation. Two percent founded their companies more than 20 years
after graduation.
   The survey said more than half were the children of parents who
founded their own companies.
   Many of the companies had inauspicious beginnings in basements
or rough neighborhoods with minimal staff and equipment. But some
of the entrepreneurs had more colorful starts.
   Clark Abt, founder of the social sciences consulting firm Abt
Associates, built ship models and sold them to Saks Fifth Avenue
when he was only 12. Harold ``Doc'' Edgerton, whom the institute
called ``the father of flash photography,'' attempted to market his
first strobe equipment through General Electric Co., but GE wasn't
interested.
   The three most important lessons the entrepreneurs said MIT
taught them were problem solving, the importance of hard work,
confidence and the belief that anything is possible.
   And when these busy people take the time to relax and enjoy
success, most said they enjoyed tennis, skiing, sailing, music and
art and reading.
   In the advice department, the entrepreneurs recommend that
aspiring business adventurers begin by identifying a market
opportunity and matching it with an appropriate technology, select
partners with talents that complement their own and remember that
the success of the enterprise rests with the performance of its
employees.

<HEAD>Another Scientist Sees Evidence of Possible Cold Fusion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new experiment confirms observations from the
controversial cold fusion research announced last month, giving
``very encouraging'' evidence for fusion, a scientist says.
   The new experiment generated more power than it consumed and
showed two other signs of possible fusion, said researcher Uziel
Landau.
   But results so far are only preliminary and ``we stop short of
saying that we see fusion,'' said Landau, a professor of chemical
engineering at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
   Fusion is the nuclear reaction that powers the sun, and some
scientists hope to harness it as an environmentally benign power
source. It occurs when the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse.
   Last month, researchers announced at the University of Utah that
they had produced fusion at room temperature with a simple
apparatus. Conventional fusion research uses extremely high
temperatures and complex machinery.
   Since the announcement, some scientists have reported similar
results while others said their attempts to confirm the work failed.
   Landau worked with two large test tubes, each containing a small
palladium rod to act as one electrode, and a titanium-coated
platinum mesh to serve as the other.
   The electrodes were placed in a bath of so-called heavy water,
in which hydrogen is replaced by a chemical cousin called
deuterium. The liquid also contained lithium, Landau said Thursday
in an interview.
   According to proponents of cold fusion, the reaction occurs in
one of the electrodes when current is applied.
   Landau said his apparatus produced three possible signs of
fusion.
   One was that the apparatus gave off 8 percent to 30 percent more
power than it consumed, with the output given off as heat, he said.
The apparatus also produced bursts of extremely tiny particles
called neutrons.
   And the heavy water solution showed about a doubling of its
initial concentration of tritium, which is a form of hydrogen,
Landau said.
   Landau said he did not test for production of helium, a product
of fusion.
   Future experiments will use ordinary water rather than heavy
water, Landau said. Scientists say that can help rule out the
possibility that a chemical reaction, rather than a nuclear
reaction, produced the experimental results.

   Roy Acuff, the 85-year-old ``king of
country music,'' would like to continue performing despite an
earlier announcement that he's considering retiring, the general
manager of the Grand Ole Opry says.
   Acuff, best known for ``The Wabash Cannonball,'' was honored
earlier this week with a special humanitarian award at The
Nashville Networks' Viewers' Choice Awards.
   ``I seem to be a burden on other people,'' the fiddler-singer
said after receiving the award. ``I have to be helped through the
crowd like a baby. I have to be treated like a baby.''
   But Hal Durham, Opry general manager, said Acuff has told him he
wants to remain on stage where he has performed for presidents and
plumbers alike.
   ``The only health problem I'm aware of is his loss of vision,''
Durham said. ``But he still sees, and he wants to work all the
shows this year.''
   ``He has to depend on someone to help him, and to a person who's
been so active, that's a tough adjustment,'' Durham said.
   Acuff has entertained on the Opry's radio show for 51 years. For
more than 20 years, he made overseas trips to entertain U.S. armed
forces at Christmas.

   Singer Lena Horne says she'd like to get married
again, but doubts she can find a good match.
   ``The women's movement came a little late in my life,'' Ms.
Horne, 71, says in the Sunday issue of Parade magazine.
   ``I find many women who don't have the need I do. They want to
be independent, see somebody when they feel like it, maybe _ but
otherwise, a man is not convenient in their lives.
   ``I envy that, but I would like to be married,'' said Ms. Horne,
whose husband, bandleader-arranger Lennie Hayton, died in 1971
after 24 years of marriage.
   Still, ``I doubt whether I could make a successful marriage now.
I've worked out the way I am,'' she added. ``Unless _ unless the
man was absolutely unique, one who could match my experiences.
Maybe ... if he was a man who has had as many metamorphoses in his
life as I've had.''
   Ms. Horne, who has released a new album titled ``The Men in My
Life,'' lamented that people think ``women in their 70's have no
desire to be desired.''

   The British rock group Pink Floyd will play five
concerts in June at Moscow's Olympic stadium.
   The band said the Soviet government made the performances
possible by offering to fly in the group's more than 300 tons of
stage equipment.
   Dozens of lasers, computerized lighting systems, circular
screens, videos, fireworks, smoke effects and a model of a flying
pig, one of the band's trademarks, will be used in the show.
   ``We have always had a reputation for not cutting corners,
trying to put on the best show possible, sparing no expense and
producing some surprises,'' said guitarist Dave Gilmour.
   Soviet officials asked the band to play Moscow when Gilmour and
fellow band member Nick Mason traveled to the capital last November
to watch the Salyut 7 spaceship blast off with their album aboard.
``The Dark Side of the Moon'' is one of the biggest-selling records

   Gil Shaham, a young violinist summoned from school
in New York City to replace veteran Itzhak Perlman at two London
concerts, won plaudits from the audience and flowers from the
orchestra.
   ``This is something I've never had before,'' Shaham said in his
dressing room at the Royal Festival Hall after Thursday's
performance.
   The audience had called him back four times and cheered him
after his performance of the difficult Violin Concerto No. 1 by Max
Bruch.
   Shaham, 18, was reciting the prologue from Geoffrey Chaucer's
``The Canterbury Tales'' in an English examination on Tuesday when
he was called out and asked to fly to London the next day for two
concerts because Perlman, the Israeli virtuoso, was ill with an ear
infection.
   Shaham promptly took three days off school.
   ``I was nervous because I felt I could not fill in for
Perlman,'' Shaham said. ``I last played the Bruch in December and
the Sibelius in the summer.''
   ``But the funny thing is,'' he added, ``I had some bizarre
premonition about this. On Monday I changed the strings on my
Guadagnini (violin), which I always do before a concert, although I
wasn't booked for any concert this week.''

   Prince Charles says Romania's President Nicolae
Ceausescu is destroying that country's cultural heritage by razing
villages and replacing city buildings with ``a uniform and deathly
mock modernity.''
   In an unusual royal criticism of a foreign leader, the
40-year-old heir to the British throne said he was appalled at
``the awful specter of an entire society _ not just certain
districts _ losing its roots and its ancient communities.''
   ``The 20th century has witnessed some strange aberrations of the
human spirit but few can match the activities of rulers who boast
about their patriotism and then systematically undertake the
destruction of the cultural heritage of their people,'' Charles
said at an architecture exhibition on Wednesday.
   ``President Ceausescu has set about destroying the cities and
villages of his country and replacing them with blocks of flats
(apartments) which are a repetition of failed 1960s social
engineering mixed with the atmosphere of George Orwell's `1984,'''
he added.
   Ceausescu plans to demolish thousands of villages, as well as
historic churches and old cemeteries, to create an ideal communist
state of industrial centers and gain more farmland for use by
state-owned collective farms.

   When organizers at Arizona State University
invited Ronald Reagan to give a speech last month, fewer than
one-fourth of the 10,000 tickets were sold in advance and the
former president agreed to waive his $50,000 fee.
   Reagan, who commanded vast audiences until he left office in
January ago, is now out of the limelight, retired into the select
club of former presidents that includes Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon
and Jimmy Carter.
   Occasionally, the former president pops back into the news. Both
President Bush and Vice President Quayle visited him this week in
Southern California. And his name came up more negatively in
repeated references during the Iran-Contra trial of former White
House aide Oliver North.
   Would one have expected a less reclusive retirement given
Reagan's popularity during his two-term tenure?
   Probably not, agree president watchers. They differ, however, on
whether it's the nature of the man or the nature of the system
which is responsible.
   ``It's not unusual and not at all atypical historically for a
former president to slip from sight,'' said Stephen Hess, a
presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, an independent
think tank.
   The advent of a new president is accompanied by a flurry of
media attention and public curiosity, Hess said, and the former
White House occupant generally just drifts away from power, Hess
said.
   Reagan, 78, works in his offices atop a Los Angeles skyscraper,
say his aides. He writes speeches on such favorite topics as the
need for a line-item veto, a balanced budget amendment and an end
to the two-term limit for presidents. He has joined the board of
the conservative magazine National Review and also is planning to
write his memoirs.
   Reagan has been virtually mum on the presidency of his
successor, and he is rarely mentioned in Washington.
   One way for former presidents to step back into the limelight is
to take a shot at their predecessor. Thus, Jimmy Carter made the
news in 1981 when he criticized Reagan's budget proposal for
placing too much emphasis on defense spending and not enough on
domestic programs.
   ``But most ex-presidents are obliging and they stay out of the
hair of the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,'' said
Benjamin Ginsberg, a professor of government at Cornell University.
   Bush also has been careful to avoid criticism of his
predecessor. Last month, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu
admonished aides to refrain from unfavorable comparisons of Reagan
and Bush.
   Some former presidents have made a comeback several years later,
returning to vogue once a historical perspective of their
presidency has been established. Such was the case with Harry
Truman, who left office in 1953 an unpopular leader but was seen in
a far more favorable light in the 1960s and until he died in 1972.
   Presidents who cannot bear the obscurity of retirement are rare.
Theodore Roosevelt didn't want to be an ex-president so he ran
against fellow Republican William Howard Taft in 1912. His run
split the Republican vote, and gave Democrat Woodrow Wilson the
White House.
   ``Reagan is not about to upstage Bush,'' said Tom Korologos, a
lobbyist and Reagan friend who once served the Nixon and Ford
administrations as a legislative aide. ``Reagan did more for Bush
than any other president has done for his VP, and now he knows it's
time to get out of the picture,'' he said.
   Ginsberg and several other scholars and consultants believe Bush
aides are particularly anxious that Reagan maintain a low profile
for the time being. ``Bush lived in Reagan's shadow for eight
years. Now he needs to establish himself as an independent and
distance himself in some ways,'' Ginsberg said.
   Bush himself doesn't mention his predecessor very often as he
seeks to move subtly away from some of the domestic and foreign
policies known as the Reagan legacy.
   For example, in reaching a compromise agreement with Congress on
aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, Bush effectively killed future
military aid to the rebels _ a cause dear to Reagan's heart.
   ``It's a mark of Reagan's respect for Bush that he has bitten
his lip and avoided statements even on the things he felt so
passionately about like the Contras,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, who
served as Carter's domestic policy adviser and is now a political
consultant.

<TEXT>
   Here is an outline of the structure of the Soviet
Communist Party and government:
   PARTY STRUCTURE:
   The Communist Party holds political power in the Soviet Union,
but President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proposed changes that allow
some contested elections to form a legislature that may exercise
significant political power.
   The Communist Party's power is centered in the Politburo and the
Secretariat of the party's Central Committee.
   The Communist Party Congress, which has 5,000 elected members,
is supposed to be the party's supreme organ, and ordinarily meets
every five years. The congress elects the Central Committee, made
up of 250 to 300 of the country's top leaders. It now has 251
members.
   The Central Committee normally meets about twice a year to
approve policies and formally elects the members of the Politburo
and the Secretariat, the two highest party bodies.
   Since March 11, 1985, Gorbachev been general secretary of the
Communist Party, head of the Secretariat and leading member of the
Politburo. Since Oct. 1, 1988, Gorbachev also has been the nation's
president, holding top party and government jobs.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Secretariat:
   This Communist Party body is responsible for running social and
economic spheres as well as party personnel and ideology, and
wields tremendous power over implementation of policy. Politburo
membership and a seat on the secretariat traditionally have been
considered necessary to gain the top party job. There are now 10
secretaries, including Gorbachev.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Politburo:
   Gorbachev runs meetings of the Politburo, the party's most
powerful body. It now has 12 full members and eight candidate, or
non-voting, members. The Politburo normally meets every week.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE:
   The Supreme Soviet:
   The 1,500 members are elected from a single slate of approved
candidates and theoretically make up the top government body in the
Soviet Union. But it has traditionally met only twice a year to
ratify policy set by the Communist Party.
   Under a reform pushed through by Gorbachev, the Supreme Soviet
will become a smaller body _ with about 500 members _ that meets
several months a year. Gorbachev says he wants it to be more
active, handling operational questions the party apparatus has
assumed over the years and leaving the party to decide policy
questions. But the Supreme Soviet has not met under the new format,
and the extent of its powers is uncertain.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet:
   The presidium, which has 37 members, is the collective
presidency that Gorbachev leads as chairman. Presidents of each of
the 15 Soviet republics are members. The presidium has the power to
issue government decrees when the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, is
not in session. But the presence of Politburo and regional party
leaders in its membership ensures its actions have prior top-level
approval.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Council of Ministers:
   The council, the Soviet Union's Cabinet, is responsible for
day-to-day operation of government ministries such as agriculture
or transportation. It is headed by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, a
full member of the Politburo.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CONGRESS OF PEOPLES DEPUTIES:
   The Congress of Peoples Deputies is a new 2,250-member body
consisting of 1,500 deputies elected from geographical
organizations and 750 elected from the party and its affiliates,
social, professional and trade union organizations.
   The congress, which was elected in the first multicandidate
balloting, is empowered to choose the president and the Supreme
Soviet from among its members, amend the constitution, and review
the president's choice for premier.

   Ostracized by the State Department, confined
to the city limits, Afghanistan's top diplomat in Washington leads
a frustrating existence.
   Miagol _ the first, last and only name of Afghanistan's charge
d'affaires _ is hoping the recent pullout of 115,000 Soviet troops
from his country will ease some of the isolation imposed on him by
the United States. But he is also realistic.
   The Soviet-educated economist invited Secretary of State James
A. Baker III to his embassy's reception Thursday evening marking
the 11th anniversary of the revolution that brought to power a
Marxist-oriented government and resulted in the 1979 Soviet
invasion.
   ``They said he couldn't come, unfortunately,'' Miagol said with
a skeptical laugh.
   Very few Americans attended the reception, which drew mostly
diplomats from Soviet bloc and other communist and socialist
countries.
   For a man who has to ask permission every time he wants to leave
the city _ and is usually turned down _ Miagol was remarkably
cheerful at an interview in the resplendent red-brick mansion which
doubles as residence and embassy.
   ``Physically our life is good,'' he said, ``but morale is
difficult.''
   Miagol, one of 15 children, does not know how old he is but
estimates his age at about 40. ``My mother said there was snow on
the ground, but she didn't know in what year,'' he said.
   Miagol arrived here 10 months ago with his Russian wife and two
children. When he asked to travel to New York by car to attend the
General Assembly meetings of the U.N. last fall, he was told to go
by plane.
   When he asked permission to drive to the Soviet Embassy's
recreation compound outside Washington, he was denied. ``They said
it was too far. But people from other socialist embassies also have
25-mile limit, and they are allowed to go,'' Miagol said.
   The United States and other countries impose 25-mile travel
limits on diplomats from countries deemed unfriendly.
   ``This makes me nervous,'' Miagol said. He spends his days
reading messages received by telex from Kabul, dealing with
administrative matters relating to his three-man embassy and
keeping in touch with the extensive community of Afghan exiles in
Washington.
   His only contact with the State Department is through Richard
Gookin, head of the Protocol Department, whom he sees about twice a
month. ``I give him my opinions,'' Miagol said.
   Gookin listens politely _ ``he's a very nice man'' _ and conveys
Miagol's views to State Department experts. But Gookin refused to
accept a written message from Afghanistan's leader Najibullah
congratulating George Bush on his inauguration as president and
expressing his hopes for improved relations, Miagol said.
   ``They told me to put the envelope in a window for letters'' at
the State Department, he said. Miagol said he used the same window
to deliver a second message several weeks ago asking the United
States to stop arming the Mujahedeen rebels.
   The rebels, backed by the United States and Pakistan, fought the
Soviet occupation for nine years and are now locked in a civil war
with Najibullah's Soviet-backed government.
   The United States continues to view Najibullah as a hardline
Marxist and fails to see that he is gaining acceptance by Afghans
as the only viable choice for leading the war-wracked country,
Miagol said.
   ``They must learn from the mistakes of the Soviets, who didn't
understand the Afghan people,'' Miagol said.
   Neither the Soviets nor the Americans understand that Afghans
cannot embrace Marxism, he said. ``It is not right with our
culture, with our religion,'' said the Soviet-educated Moslem.
   The United States withheld recognition from Afghanistan's
government after the Soviets invaded, contending it was not elected
democratically and does not represent the Afghan people. However,
the U.S. Embassy continued to function in Kabul, serving as a
listening post in the Soviet-run country.
   ``The United States recognizes many governments that are not
democratic, that are fascist dictatorships,'' Miagol said. At least
Najibullah was elected to office _ ``maybe not like American
elections,'' but in accordance with Afghanistan's constitution, he
said.
   Once, the Soviets were considered the bad guys in Afghanistan
and the Americans were the good guys, Miagol said. Now, the Soviet
tanks and troops have left and they are sending wheat, flour and
oil, while the Americans send missiles to the Mujahedeen.
   ``If the U.S. continues this, Afghanistan will of course be
pro-Soviet,'' Miagol said.

<HEAD>Budget Deal Eliminates Some, Not All, USDA Uncertainty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 budget compromise worked out between
the Bush administration and Congress earlier this month has eased
some of the pressure for cutting farm subsidies but the turmoil is
far from over.
   Congress still has a way to go before settling on a spending
package for the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1, and Agriculture
Department budget experts say farm programs still are expected to
be pared.
   The compromise reached two weeks ago calls for $2.4 billion to
be whittled from agriculture functions that are covered in the
federal budget, says Robert E. Sherman, deputy director of USDA's
budget office.
   Initially, he said Thursday in an interview, the Reagan and Bush
budget proposals were identical, calling for a $2.9 billion cut in
fiscal 1990 for agriculture-related programs.
   The major target in the original Reagan-Bush budget proposals
was the package of farm programs operated by the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., a variety of price and income support
mechanisms that soared to record spending levels during the 1980s.
   The CCC cuts alone would total $1.9 billion. To help Bush show
less of a deficit on paper, part of that is to be accomplished
administratively by paying about $800 million in advance
``deficiency'' payments to farmers early, so they show up on this
year's budget rather than in the 1990 budget.
   Bush announced the early payments on April 18, pointing out that
the move would ``provide some extra money to farmers'' as they head
for the fields this spring.
   Although Bush did not mention that the move also would help
reduce his 1990 budget deficit figure, the early payments had long
been planned _ in both the initial Bush and Reagan budget proposals
_ as a way to save money next fiscal year.
   But that still left $1.1 billion to be cut from the CCC
operations if the 1990 reduction goal of $1.9 billion for CCC was
to be met.
   One of the simplist ways to cut CCC some more would be a further
reduction in crop target prices used to compute payments to
farmers. However, that would have required legislation by Congress
to give USDA authority to tinker with the payment formula.
   Sherman said the mid-April agreement between the administration
and Congress calls for a CCC reduction next year of $600 million,
or little more than half the $1.1 billion remaining to be cut. But
a solution was found.
   As it turned out, $500 million in ``savings'' for 1990 would
come from another change that will require legislation. This
involves the financing of the Farm Credit Administration and would
be used to offset further reductions in CCC costs.
   For many years the FCA enjoyed independent status as a federal
agency, and its annual spending was ``off budget'' and not counted
in the government's overall balance sheet of receipts and outlays.
   But after the farm credit problems of the 1980s forced Congress
to crack down on the huge system of federal land banks, production
credit associations and other institutions overseen by FCA, the
agency's budget has been part of the regular process.
   Sherman said that although FCA is not part of the Agriculture
Department, it is part of the ``agriculture function'' used in
budget planning. Thus, it was agreed during the compromise
deliberations to move FCA once again ``off budget'' and thereby
``save'' $500 million.
   So, with $800 million shuffled from one year to another and $500
million moved off budget, that leaves $600 million in cuts for next
year's CCC programs still to be made to reach the $1.9 billion in
cuts for next year. Exactly how remains to be settled.
   Additionally, Sherman said, the compromise calls for releasing
$500 million from a food stamp account held y the Federal Reserve,
a fund that has been building up since food stamps were initiated
in the early 1960s.
   The money accumulated because some stamps are lost, destroyed,
forgotten or otherwise not used to buy groceries. They were never
redeemed, although the government still has cash on hand just in
case.
   By releasing the food stamp account, the government will have
use of the money _ and the 1990 budget can be trimmed by a further
$500 million, making a total ``savings'' of $2.4 billion claimed by
the negotiators.
   Some have complained that the budget cutters may target their
work too much on farm programs, but Bush said on April 18 that
while agriculture ``has taken a hit, so has a wide array of
programs across the board. And I think what we've done here is
fair.''
   Others have said USDA farm programs could stand even further
pruning, pointing out that spending on those programs is still high
although there have been sharp reductions in recent years.
   In 1984, for example, CCC spending on commodity programs _
including feed grains, wheat, rice, cotton, tobacco, dairy,
soybeans, honey and wool _ was about $7.32 billion. In 1985, costs
jumped to $17.7 billion and then rose to a record $25.8 billion in
1986.
   Commodity program spending dropped to $22.4 billion in 1987 and
since has declined to an estimated $13.8 billion this year.

   The outlaw Snow White has disappeared and the
copyright lawsuits have been shelved, but the real impact of the
61st Academy Awards has not diminished in the month since the
curtain fell on the glitzy ceremony.
   ``Rain Man,'' winner of five major trophies, including best
picture, has enjoyed a record-breaking post-Oscar surge, and a
number of lesser victors have profited handsomely from their awards.
   ``Rain Man,'' the reigning domestic box-office champion with
revenues of $156 million, is now MGM-United Artists'
highest-grossing film ever, and is expected to be its biggest
international hit, too.
   Meanwhile, best foreign film winner ``Pelle the Conqueror'' is
selling tickets at a brisk pace across the country, and sales for
best original song ``Let the River Run'' from ``Working Girl'' have
skyrocketed. ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' which won an Oscar for best
supporting actor, is No. 1 on the home video-rental charts.
   Most post-Oscar publicity focused on the Oscar telecast's
opening production number in which an unauthorized Snow White
impersonator presented material so strange Disney promptly sued for
copyright infringement.
   In addition, a group of 17 producers, actors, directors and
writers complained to the Academy that the show, with all its hype
and glitz, ``was an embarrassment to both the Academy and the
entire motion picture industry.'' The note, dated two days after
the March 29 show, was sent to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences President Richard Kahn and the Academy's board of
governors.
   ``It is neither fitting nor acceptable that the best work in
motion pictures be acknowledged in such a demeaning fashion,'' said
the letter, signed by Julie Andrews, Stanley Donen, Blake Edwards,
Sidney Lumet, Paul Newman, Gregory Peck, Billy Wilder and others.
   But the performance by ``Rain Man'' has transcended the flap
over the telecast.
   ``Rain Man'' has taken in $127 million internationally, and the
story of a scheming car salesman learning to love his autistic
brother will likely surpass all of United Artists' ``Rocky''
sequels and James Bond features in foreign receipts.
   ``A year ago, when we planned the release of this picture, we
felt with the cast and the director and the story structure, that
we had a major chance for Academy nominations and awards,'' said
Jack Gordon, president of MGM International.
   ``So we planned the foreign release so that we would be breaking
on the screens around the world at the time the nominations were
announced and the awards were given. So the strategy worked
perfectly and the picture has just bombarded the marketplace.''
   ``Rain Man'' is now playing in more than 50 countries, Gordon
said. In 6{ weeks of release in Japan, ``Rain Man'' has grossed in
excess of $25 million. The movie's Oscar triumph _ it also won best
actor for Dustin Hoffman, best director for Barry Levinson and best
original screenplay for Ron Bass and Barry Morrow _ has boosted
many of the film's related performers.
   Valeria Golino, the movie's co-star, now is inundated with
scripts and has just completed the coming feature ``Torrents of
Spring.''
   For other movies that might have faded without any Oscar hype,
the Academy Awards have given them a fresh jolt of momentum.
   ``Upon winning the Academy Award, we've found that a lot more
people are interested in `Pelle' and in (the film's star) Max Von
Sydow,'' said Adam Rogers, national sales manager for ``Pelle the
Conqueror'' distributor Miramax. Rogers said ``Pelle,'' with $1.9
million in the bank to date, is now playing in such cities as
Winsted, Conn., Fargo, N.D., and Orem, Utah, not bad for a 2{-hour
film about Swedish immigrants working on a turn-of-the-century farm
and speaking not one word of English.

<HEAD>Non-Working Senior Judges are Obstacle for Judicial Pay Raise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five congressmen put a trio of leading judges
on notice: the pay raise so vigorously sought by federal judges may
well depend on denying it to senior judges who do no judicial work.
   ``Pay raises should be reserved for those who work,'' said Rep.
Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., chairman of the House courts
subcommittee.
   His message was echoed by four Republican and Democratic
colleagues at a hearing Thursday. They were taken aback by
testimony from the judicial leaders, who are seeking a 30 percent
pay raise for all federal judges.
   U.S. Circuit Judge Frank Coffin depicted a federal bench
demoralized over the loss of a 51 percent pay raise earlier this
year, but he displayed no willingness to compromise in response to
complaints over pay that members of Congress hear when they go home
to the voters.
   ``I have never seen so many judges at all levels, in all courts,
and in all parts of the country so disheartened as I do today,''
Coffin said. ``Ours is a lunar landscape with all of the stark and
ominous silhouettes that the term implies.''
   He called Feb. 7, the day Congress defeated the pay raise,
``Black Tuesday.''
   But Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., replied, ``Many voters in my
district do not regard it as Black Tuesday, and I'm one of them.''
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said, ``One catalyst for that
defeat was the front page story in most of the nation's newspapers
that former Chief Justice Warren Burger'' and other senior judges
who do no judicial work would get the raise.
   He said he went to four town meetings in his district at that
time ``and I heard about that 50 times if I heard about it once.''
   Then he offered the three judges what he called ``a little bit
of friendly advice: the senior judge situation must be resolved if
you want a pay raise. ... And I've not seen much in the way of
constructive suggestions from you.''
   Rep. George Sangmeister, D-Ill., said he too was peppered with
objections at town meetings after the news stories.
   ``I was faced with the Burger question,'' Sangmeister said.
``And I was not able to defend that.''
   Earlier this year, The Associated Press reported previously
unpublished federal figures from 1987 that showed that 20 percent
of 306 senior federal judges did no judicial work. These include
Burger, who since he stepped down has spent his time chairing the
celebration of the bicentennials of the Constitution and Bill of
Rights.
   An Associated Press survey of all senior judges in February and
March of this year found that 17 percent of 277 senior judges did
no judicial work. The AP survey credited judges for dormant cases
still on their dockets, which the earlier government data had not.
   Coffin and his colleagues told the subcommittee it would be
unfair to deprive non-working senior judges of pay raises by, as
Coffin put it, ``suddenly changing the rules after a lifetime.'' He
said only three of the non-working seniors were under age 70; 16
were in their 70s, 20 in their 80s, two in their 90s and two in
their 100s.
   Kastenmeier asked whether these non-working senior judges
shouldn't go into full retirement.
   Kastenmeier and the subcommittee's ranking Republican, Rep.
Carlos Moorhead of California, introduced a bill earlier this month
to require that senior judges carry a 25 percent workload to
qualify for raises. Those senior judges who did less work would get
their last full salary and cost-of-living increases, but no raises
above that.
   At the hearing, Kastenmeier announced that he and Moorhead had
agreed to the judges' request to introduce in Congress a 30 percent
pay raise and annual cost-of-living increases for judges.
   President Bush has proposed a 25 percent pay raise for judges. A
51 percent raise tied to equal increases for Congress and top
executive branch officials died earlier this year in the face of
public uproar.
   Currently, judges who reach 65 with 15 years experience can
resign and keep for life the full salary on their last day of work.
They get no cost-of-living increases but are allowed to resume the
private practice of law. Currently, 14 have done this.
   Alternatively, at that age and experience, federal judges may
opt for senior status and do as much or as little work as they
like. These senior judges still pick up all the pay raises given to
active judges, and like active judges they can't have private law
practices. The number of judges in this category hovers near 300.
There are about 700 active judges.

<HEAD>Kremlin Will Publish Defense and Space Spending Data, Scientist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kremlin will publish long-promised figures
on the Soviet defense and space budgets by the end of the year,
says Roald Sagdeyev, a leading Russian rocket scientist who is
prominent in the reform movement.
   Soviet military spending is being cut 1.5 percent this year, far
short of the 14.2 percent cut announced by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in January, said Sagdeyev, who is a member of the Supreme
Soviet, or parliament.
   Defense spending will go down another 7 percent in 1990, and the
cuts will reach 14.2 percent the following year, he said, although
the total amount of the cuts remained unclear.
   ``We have promised that the absolute figure would be given in
the fall,'' Sagdeyev told a group of reporters Thursday. Sagdeyev
declined to specify how he knew that military spending figures
would be disclosed by year end, but he is thought to be part of a
group of scientists and intellectuals who advise Gorbachev on
foreign policy.
   Sagdeyev was also elected in balloting March 26 to represent the
Soviet Academy of Sciences in the newly created Congress of
Peoples' Deputies, which will have the twin functions of electing a
Soviet president _ almost certainly voting Gorbachev a new
five-year term _ and selecting a new smaller parliament.
   The issue of Soviet military spending is murky. For years,
Western analysts have complained that figures for Soviet defense
spending were distorted because prices are set by the state, and
the cost of expensive armaments could be vastly underestimated in
official statistics.
   An indefinite delay in implementing price deregulation has led
Western analysts to say that even more complete disclosure of
Soviet military spending cannot be accurate, since Soviet leaders
themselves do not know the true cost of weapons.
   A study released last weekend by the Central Intelligence Agency
and the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency said that Soviet
military spending had risen by 3 percent in 1988.
   The CIA found strong evidence, however, that last year
``Gorbachev took several actions that evidently were intended to
lay the groundwork for future military cuts.''
   Furthermore, the CIA concluded, the 14.2 percent cut in military
spending announced by Gorbachev last January probably will lead to
much larger cuts than the 500,000 troop reduction he announced at
the United Nations last December.
   Sagdeyev's description of the 14.2 percent defense cuts as
gradual suggested that Gorbachev wants to make them as part of arms
control agreements with the United States.
   Sagdeyev, in a wide-ranging discussion, also released the text
of a hitherto undisclosed resolution he said was passed by the
Academy of Sciences last week describing the deaths of 20
demonstrators in Soviet Georgia as a ``criminal act'' that
endangered to Kremlin reforms.
   Sagdeyev was one of three members of the Soviet academy, along
with human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov and Russian historian
Dmitri S. Likhachev, appointed to a parliamentary investigating
panel.
   ``The tragic events in Tbilisi (capital of Soviet Georgia)
confirm the sad fact that perestroika is in danger,'' said the
resolution, using the Russian name for Gorbachev's reforms.
   Special uniformed troops under the Soviet Interior Ministry, or
MVD, were responsible for using poisonous chemicals, shovels and
clubs to suppress the demonstrations in Tbilisi on April 9, killing
20 people, the statement said.
   ``This unusually cruel act has evoked the deep indignation and
outrage of our entire society,'' said the resolution, which
Sagdeyev said was passed at a meeting of the entire Academy of
Sciences April 21.

<TEXT>
   NASA, designing systems in which
three or four seconds ``is forever,'' has developed a
graphics-oriented computer program to help flight controllers react
to launch emergencies.
   Atlantis, with five astronauts aboard, was scheduled to launch
at midafternoon today.
   In the seconds and minutes after liftoff, NASA is to make its
most extensive use of a flight control system which highlights
potential hazards with colorful displays.
   Past mission managers had to sort through mind-numbing columns
of data on black-and-white monitors that date back to the Gemini
era of the 1960s.
   The new system, inaugurated at Mission Control after the 1986
Challenger disaster, gives NASA controllers three or four more
seconds to order a shuttle into an emergency landing in case of a
sudden failure after liftoff.
   ``Three to four seconds in a lot of different failure modes is
forever,'' says senior NASA controller John F. Muratore.
   From typewriter-style keyboards, controllers can now punch up
graphics that trace the shuttle trajectory, duplicate cockpit
instrument displays and even mimic the horizon as the astronauts
see it from inside their rising space ship.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is designing
artificial intelligence programs to help plug its ``brain drain''
as thousands of experienced Apollo era employees retire. The
generic name for such programs is ``expert systems.''
   NASA has begun implementing its expert system at the Mission
Control center in Houston as part of a multimillion-dollar
improvement program scheduled for completion in 1991. Muratore is
in charge of developing the system.
   NASA hopes expert systems can capture the knowledge of veteran
employees to help younger workers do various jobs. Muratore
predicted his system will cut months off the minimum time of two
years that controllers must spend in training before being assigned
to a flight.
   ``They have to make a mental picture of what's going on with the
shuttle,'' Muratore explained. ``We took some senior controllers
and learned how they built their mental models, then programmed the
computer to do that for them.''
   When shuttles returned to flight in September, NASA installed
the expert system to help engineers pinpoint trouble in the
orbiter's three main engines. It ran in tandem with the traditional
system.
   ``We were prepared to take actions'' based on the new program,
Muratore said. ``I don't know of any other case where somebody has
built an expert system and then put life and property on the line
that way.''
   Since then, Muratore said, the system has become a ``primary
tool'' for four controllers who monitor communications, engines,
mechanical systems, and guidance and navigation.
   With the system NASA is phasing out, controllers decipher
multiple pages of data displayed on their computer screens, all
while monitoring dozens of blinking console lights _ each of which
can signal two or more safe or unsafe conditions.
   In the old system, flight information is stored in two computers
and displayed on every controller's console. By comparison,
Muratore's system divides the data among individual consoles,
shaving precious seconds off the processing.

<HEAD>House Panel Wants S&amp;L Owners to Put up More Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Banking Committee members who want
savings and loan owners to put up more of their own money when they
make loans will be fighting to preserve a legislative victory when
they resume work next week on President Bush's bailout proposal.
   After hours of debate, the panel voted 36-15 Thursday to require
S&amp;L owners by January 1995 to risk $3 of ``tangible'' or ``real
money'' capital for every $100 they lend.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady praised the action in a
statement released after the vote, even though the deadline is 3{
years later than the June 1991 date sought by the administration.
   ``Requiring S&amp;Ls to put their own capital at risk ahead of the
taxpayers' money is the only way to prevent in the future the
unsound business practices that contributed to the current
crisis,'' Brady said.
   Bush is proposing to spend at least $157 billion over 10 years,
the bulk of it from taxpayers, to close or merge failed S&amp;Ls. He
also wants to restructure the regulatory system, spend $50 million
a year to investigate and prosecute fraud in S&amp;Ls and boost capital
requirements.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mullins said the panel's
adoption of a 3 percent layer of protection between S&amp;L loans that
could go sour and federal insurance funds was more important than
the timetable for achieving it.
   However, consumer groups are worried about a subsequent
amendment, sponsored by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., that would
permit thrift institutions to continue to risk depositors' funds in
subsidiaries involved in high-risk investments such as junk bonds
and commercial real estate.
   ``It's a pretty critical loophole,'' said Peggy Miller, a
lobbyist for the Consumer Federation of America. ``It erodes what
was just passed.''
   The administration had proposed that institutions raise extra
capital to back those subsidiaries and the committee chairman, Rep.
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, had attempted to compromise by giving
institutions five years to come up with the money.
   However, the committee voted 26-24 to adopt McCollum's measure.
He argued that without it many institutions now operating safely
and profitably with subsidiaries would not be able to raise the
extra capital.
   Another amendment, sponsored by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
would permit federal regulators to count mortgage servicing
contracts as capital. Such contracts, which pay institutions to
collect monthly payments from homeowners on behalf of investors who
own the mortgages, provide a steady source of income and can be
sold if an institution is closed.
   The overall capital measure has a series of interim targets,
beginning June 1, 1990, when the tangible capital standard would
become 1.5 percent. It would move to 2 percent in January 1992,
2.25 percent in January 1993 and 2.625 percent in January 1994
before reaching the full 3 percent a year later.
   The House committee's standard is substantially stricter than
the bill passed last week by the Senate, which would require 1.5
percent tangible capital by June 1991.
   Current law provides for a 3 percent standard, but contains many
accounting loopholes that count intangible assets such as
``goodwill'' as capital.
   At the end of last year, more than a third of the solvent S&amp;Ls'
$60 billion in listed capital was composed of goodwill, which
represents the value an institution's customer loyalty and name
recognition. Critics argue that goodwill evaporates when an
institution fails and thus provides no protection to government
deposit insurance funds.
   According to the Treasury Department, about two-thirds of the
nation's 3,000 S&amp;Ls can meet the 3 percent tangible standard. Some
of those that do not should be able to raise the money, but about
245 may have to seek merger partners, it said.
   Institutions failing to meet the standard would be subject to
growth restrictions and closer regulatory supervision.
   Rep. Floyd Flake, D-N.Y., said he intends to offer an amendment
Monday that would provide more favorable treatment of goodwill. He
and others, including the powerful chairman of the House Rules
Committee, Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., argue that it is unfair to
wipe out the goodwill because during the early 1980s regulators
permitted the accounting break to otherwise healthy institutions in
exchange for taking over ailing thrifts.

<HEAD>Anti-Baldness Drug Works on Growth Genes, Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers for a Michigan pharmaceutical
company say the anti-baldness drug minoxidil appears to stimulate
the genes that make hair grow.
   Minoxidil ``not only affects growing cells, but affects cells
that make hair-shaft protein,'' Vincent Groppi Jr., a research with
the Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich., said Wednesday. ``Minoxidil
affects gene activity that affects the growth of the (hair) shaft.''
   Knowledge gained from study of minoxidil's effects on genes
could have implications for research into genetically based
diseases, such as sickle-cell anemia, said Allen Buhl, also an
Upjohn researcher.
   Marketed by Upjohn under the trade-name Rogaine, minoxidil was
originally developed for use internally to control blood pressure.
The Food and Drug Administration last year approved the drug for
use externally as a treatment for baldness.
   Although the drug is approved for sale, scientists haven't
clearly understood why minoxidil promotes hair growth. Upjohn
researchers had theorized that the drug improved the flow of blood
to the hair roots, thereby stimulating growth.
   However, the Upjohn research, released at the annual meeting of
the Society for Investigational Dermatology, suggested the drug had
a more basic effect on hair growth.
   Groppi said he believes minoxidil's effect on the genes is
particularly strong. ``I can't think of (a drug) offhand that has
such a potent effect on gene expression,'' he said.
   Another scientist, however, was skeptical that the Upjohn
finding represented a significant advance.
   ``It could well be that it does affect those genes, but there
are very many stimulants on the cells that control genes,'' said
Robert Weinberg, biology professor at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. ``That does not set minoxidil
apart.''
   Although the drug may affect hair follicles, there is no reason
to believe that the drug would have similar effects on other types
of cells, Weinberg said.
   Weinberg said the research would have been more convincing had
it identified a specific gene or group of genes affected by the
drug. Upjohn spokeswoman Kaye Bennett said the researchers hadn't
identified a specific gene.

   A hearing on why a cargo door tore off a United
Airlines 747, killing nine passengers, ended without conclusive
evidence on the cause of the February accident southwest of Hawaii.
   The National Transportation Safety Board listened for three days
to a list of missteps by United Airlines and the Federal Aviation
Administration, and grilled aircraft designers from The Boeing Co.,
but no culprit emerged.
   ``The hearings here were extremely helpful,'' Lee Dickinson,
chairman of the NTSB investigation, said Thursday. ``We gained a
lot of good information.''
   He declined to make any conclusions, but said the information
will be analyzed for several months before the NTSB issues a final
report identifying the probable cause of the accident, Dickinson
said.
   The cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off United Flight
811 as the Boeing 747 was climbing to 23,000 feet on Feb. 24. Nine
passengers were sucked out of the plane over the Pacific Ocean, 85
miles southwest of Honolulu as the plane headed for Australia via
New Zealand.
   Speculation has focused on a possible malfunction in the locking
mechanism of the cargo door, which remains on the bottom of the
Pacific Ocean. The NTSB has not decided whether to retrieve the
door.
   On Thursday, United Airlines officials said they failed to fully
inspect a cargo door after electrical repairs were made two months
before the accident.
   A United executive said mechanics made a partial inspection of
the cargo door after it was repaired Dec. 23 in Chicago. That was a
coincidence, because the company has testified it was unaware it
was under federal regulations to do a full inspection of the doors.
   ``I am convinced the check ... verified that the door was
working,'' said Robert Doll, United vice president for technical
services.
   He added, however, that the inspection was not as thorough as
the Federal Aviation Administration required.
   In other testimony, an FAA inspector who oversees United's
31-plane 747 fleet said he was not aware of the problems with the
800-pound cargo door.
   The inspector, George Batiza, also said the FAA had failed to
ensure that United complied with a federal rule that took effect
July 1, requiring airlines to inspect cargo doors after they were
manually operated because of electrical problems.
   Batiza testified that he had not found any deficiencies in
United's maintenance program recently, even though United officials
have acknowledged they were unaware of the FAA rule on cargo door
inspections and were not in compliance for about nine months.

   House Speaker Jim Wright sent an $8,000 check
this week to pay the costs of chartering a campaign airplane four
years ago from an associate of the owner of a Dallas savings and
loan institution.
   Wright, who on Thursday lost his bid to make an early
presentation of his case before the House ethics committee, said
the failure to pay the bill earlier was an ``oversight.''
   In another matter Thursday, the House ethics committee
rescheduled the testimony of five Texans involved in a gas drilling
venture that yielded huge profits to Wright. The five were
threatened with a contempt citation if they fail to show up for a
second time.
   Wright's office this week filed a correction to his campaign
financial report for 1985 to disclose the reimbursement. Aide Phil
Duncan said he didn't ask the owner of the plane, Ken Hood, why he
suddenly called this week for the money.
   Wright's office was notified of the unpaid bill on Tuesday after
Hood learned that the Wall Street Journal was inquiring about the
matter, according to knowledgeable sources.
   According to a Democratic source who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Hood was an associate of Thomas Gaubert. Gaubert, owner
of a Dallas savings and loan institution, arranged the charter for
Wright's campaign, the source said.
   The trip June 30 to July 2, 1985, included Wright, Duncan and
others. The tour of seven Texas cities was in preparation for a
November fund-raiser, Wright's office said.
   The ethics committee has decided against pursuing charges that
Wright improperly lobbied federal S&amp;L regulators to go easy on
Texas thrifts, including Gaubert's. But Wright's involvement in S&amp;L
issues has figured in the panel's determination of whether he
improperly took gifts from people with a direct interest in
legislation governing the industry.
   On Wright's request to make a personal appeal to the ethics
panel, its chairman hinted strongly for the first time Thursday
there will be no such opportunity until Wright appears at a
disciplinary hearing expected to come late next month.
   ``No, there has not been an agreement reached'' on a speedy
hearing, said the chairman, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif. ``I assume
he would appear at the disciplinary hearing.''
   At a two-hour meeting Thursday behind closed doors, the panel
heard an account from Dixon and Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana of
their trip early this week to San Antonio, Texas, when they were
``stood up'' by the participants in the gas well venture.
   The panel then ratified Dixon's ruling that a subpoena for the
witnesses was valid and enforceable, the chairman said. The
testimony is scheduled for next week.
   ``Without any question, the committee lost round one, but
there'll be more of this fight before it's over,'' said Myers, the
panel's senior Republican.
   The committee is seeking to wrap up loose ends in its 10-month
investigation of Wright, who has been formally charged with 69
instances of violating House rules. The charges allege that Wright,
D-Texas, improperly accepted some $145,000 in gifts from a Fort
Worth business partner who had a direct interest in congressional
legislation and that he used bulk sales of a book he wrote to
circumvent House limits on outside earned income.
   But before finishing its preliminary inquiry into charges
against Wright, the panel wants to know whether a gas well that
produced a financial bonanza to the speaker's blind trust amounted
to a gift from people with an interest in legislation.
   Part of the inquiry also will focus on whether Wright's blind
trust, which the ethics committee approved when the trust was
established in 1987, was truly insulated from Wright.
   Mallightco, an investment partnership of Fort Worth real estate
developer George Mallick, and their wives, turned a $9,120 cash
investment into a $340,000 profit in one day last May, boosting the
value of the partnership just a month before Wright's blind trust
sold its interest.
   The amount of money involved aroused the curiosity of the ethics
panel, and subpoenas were issued for San Antonio financier Morris
Jaffe, his son M.D. (Doug) Jaffe, and three others involved in the
transaction.
   The five failed to show up Tuesday for a scheduled interview at
a San Antonio hotel. Stanley Brand, their Washington lawyer, argued
in a letter that the subpoenas were too broad, violated his
clients' right to privacy and were irrelevant to the ethics panel's
inquiry.
   The committee overruled Brand and ordered the witnesses to come
to Washington for interviews on May 3 and 4, Dixon said.

<HEAD>House Panel Sends $1.17 Trillion Budget to Floor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading lawmakers predict that a $1.17
trillion budget for 1990, thrashed out in days of often contentious
closed-door meetings by the House Budget Committee, will be
approved by the House next week.
   The panel approved the spending plan on a bipartisan 18-6 vote
on Thursday, edging the budget deal completed two weeks ago between
President Bush and congressional leaders closer to enactment.
   The proposal claims a deficit of $99.4 billion, just within the
$100 billion ceiling required by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget
law. It would hold defense spending below the rate of inflation and
give big boosts to education, science and health programs, while
cutting agriculture, environment and energy spending.
   As they finished their work on the document, committee members
echoed remarks made frequently in recent days about the direction
this year's budget seems to be headed.
   ``I assume it will pass because there is no alternative,'' said
Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn., who voted against the proposal in
committee.
   Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., who also opposed the plan, said he
believed that the deficit reduction it claimed was largely phony,
but that the proposal would be approved anyway.
   ``With the head of steam it's got from the budget summit and
from the Democratic and Republican leadership, it will be hard to
overcome,'' he said.
   House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., who is on the
committee, also predicted the measure would clear the chamber,
saying he expected little trouble from conservatives over the
defense expenditures it permits.
   ``Do you think people will look at the defense money in this
bill, with its being blessed by Bush and Cheney, and say it's not
enough?'' Foley said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said he believes the cuts in
the defense budget will be difficult but are manageable.
   Because the budget pact between Bush and congressional leaders
set overall spending limits for defense, domestic programs and
foreign aid, those figures are identical in the House and Senate
versions of the budget. The main differences between the two
chambers is in how they distribute domestic funds.
   Energy programs would get $3.8 billion in the House plan and
$4.2 billion in the Senate. Health spending would reach $56.2
billion under the House proposal and $55.7 billion under the
Senate. Education would get $39.1 billion under the House budget
and $38.7 billion under the Senate.
   The House budget writers set aside enough money to pay for a
Democratic initiative on children, with $1.8 billion for child care
and more money for Head Start; an increase to $1.9 billion for AIDS
research and treatment; full-inflation increases in programs for
the poor; and a 3.6 percent cost-of-living raise for military and
civilian federal workers.
   Before holding a brief public meeting at which they approved the
spending plan, the budget committee met behind closed doors this
week, arguing over spending priorities and working out a bipartisan
deal.
   According to meeting participants who asked to not be
identified, those sessions resulted in money being transferred to
space and science programs, and to veterans programs, from other
domestic initiatives.
   There were also attempts by liberals to slash the defense budget
and distribute the money to domestic programs, such as Medicare,
AIDS research, low-income programs, veterans health, and anti-drug
efforts.
   The Senate Budget Committee passed its version of the budget on
April 19. That chamber also expects to complete work next week on
its spending blueprint.

<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest who is defying orders
from his Jesuit superior in the United States to leave a group that
provides aid to rural Nicaraguans has appealed his case to the
Vatican.
   The Rev. Bill Callahan, co-director of the Quixote Center in Mt.
Rainier, Md., held a news conference Thursday to declare his
defiance. Callahan, a Jesuit for 40 of his 57 years, is also under
orders to dissociate himself from a progressive Catholic group and
one that supports the ordination of women as priests.
   Callahan's order, for its part, refused to make the controversy
any more public than it already was.
   ``Dealings ...between a religious and his superior are very much
a confidential matter, and superiors find themselves in the
position of having to protect that confidentiality,'' the Rev. Paul
Kenney, press officer of the New England province of the Society of
Jesus, said by telephone from Boston.
   The Rev. Robert E. Manning, Jesuit provincial in Boston, has
twice ordered Callahan, on pain of dismissal from the society, to
leave the center and join a Jesuit community in Boston within 15
days.
   Callahan appealed the order to the Rev. Peter Kolvenbach, Jesuit
general in Rome, saying, ``To leave at this time would be a serious
betrayal of my responsibility toward the people of Nicaragua.''
   Callahan said Mannings's orders would make it impossible for him
to carry on the work of Quest for Peace, an organization which he
coordinates from the Quixote Center's headquarters.
   In his letter to Kolvenbach, he said Quest for Peace was formed
``to match U.S. military aid to the counter-revolutionaries
attacking Nicaragua with an equivalent value in donated
humanitarian aid for the people of Nicaragua.''
   He said he had coordinated campaigns which raised $227 million
over a three-year period in donated aid and contributed services.
   Earlier, Manning had told Callahan that in order to remain a
member of the society he must dissociate himself from ``Catholics
Speak Out,'' an organization of Progressive Catholics, and
``Priests for Equality,'' which favors the ordination of women as
priests.
   In a letter on April 3, after Callahan said he was willing to
work toward ``an acceptable compromise to alleviate the
situation,'' Manning told Callahan, ``In fact, this is not a
question of `compromise.' It is, to repeat, a matter of obedience.''
   Callahan said the second deadline for him to report in Boston
was April 2. He said he had heard nothing further about his
dismissal.
   Manning also wrote to Callahan that he must ``make no public
statements critical of the church or its leadership without my
prior knowledge and consent'' and not ``add any projects to the
mission I have given you without my prior consent.''

<TEXT>
   A mudslide caused by 30 hours of
torrential rain killed nine gold miners and left seven others
seriously injured in northwestern Brazil, police said.
   The mining accident occurred late Tuesday in the jungle
municipality of Mucajai, 4,000 miles northwest of Rio, federal
police Capt. Maya de Guerra said in a telephone interview from Boa
Vista, capital of the Amazon state of Roriama.
   No one had heard that the 50-foot ``Deep Hole'' mine had caved
in until one of the miners made his way 279 miles through the
jungle and arrived in Boa Vista late Thursday, de Guerra said.
   ``A group of miners were apparently inside the hole when a wall
of mud fell in on them and swallowed them alive,'' de Guerra said.
``Seven of the men managed to make it out alive but they were badly
hurt.''
   De Guerra said rescue teams made up of state and civil police
were sent to the site but poor weather and the rugged terrain had
delayed their arrival.
   An estimated 1 million prospectors have invaded Brazil's vast
Amazon rain forests after rich deposits of alluvial gold were
discovered in 1979.
   Since then, thousands of people, mostly unskilled, have been
lured to mine sites in the Amazon where they dig with their hands
and carry bags of mud on their backs in search of gold.
   In 1986, a similar mudslide killed 12 prospectors and hurt 20
others at ``The Hole'' gold mine in the northern state of Para.
   Government officials said last year that miners recovered about
70 tons of gold from the wilderness, worth an estimated $1 billion.

<HEAD>House Democrats Seeking Outside Counsel To Investigate Gingrich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee, which agreed to
Rep. Newt Gingrich's demand a year ago for an outside counsel to
investigate Speaker Jim Wright, now is being asked to hire another
independent lawyer to investigate Gingrich.
   Four House Democrats drafted a letter Thursday to Rep. Julian
Dixon, D-Calif, chairman of the ethics panel, calling for the
appointment of an outside counsel to investigate the complaint Rep.
Bill Alexander, D-Ark., filed against the House Republican whip
earlier this month.
   Reps. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, Larry Smith of Florida, Pat
Schroeder of Colorado and Albert Bustamante of Texas sent copies of
the letter to their House Democratic colleagues seeking support for
their request to Dixon.
   ``There is mounting evidence that Congressman Gingrich may have
violated an assortment of House rules and federal campaign finance
laws over an extended period of time through financial and other
dealings,'' the four Democrats said in the letter to their
colleagues.
   The letter to Dixon said the Democrats want ``to preserve the
integrity of the committee's consideration process from
politicization and outside pressure, and in that regard we believe
the appointment of an impartial outside counsel is imperative.''
   Alexander's complaint, which was filed as the committee was
nearing the end of its investigation of Wright, lists 10 apparent
violations of House rules in the formation and operation of a
limited partnership set up in 1984 to promote a book co-written by
Gingrich. The committee has not indicated whether it will launch a
formal investigation of the compliant.
   Gingrich and his wife, Marianne Gingrich, released nearly 400
pages of documents on Tuesday detailing the financial and
incorporation history of the partnership. They denied any violation
of House rules.
   Eighteen people and three corporations, including many regular
contributors to Gingrich's political campaigns, each invested
$5,000 in the partnership, which was controlled by Mrs. Gingrich,
the general partner.
   In return for promoting the book, the partnership was to have
received half the publisher's profits, but the publisher lost money
and the investors ended up with a tax writeoff. Mrs. Gingrich was
paid $11,500 by the partnership and received a 2 percent ownership
interest in the organization.
   Gingrich had no direct financial stake in the partnership,
although he did receive $1,320 in expense reimbursements when he
traveled to promote the book. He and his wife also received $12,018
each in royalties from the publisher from sales of the book.
   While Democrats were drumming up support for their bid for an
outside counsel, Gingrich was at the National Press Club outlining
the message of Democratic corruption and Republican opportunity he
used propel himself in the House GOP leadership last month.
   The Jonesboro, Ga., Republican said the GOP must build a
``caring, humanitarian, reform'' party that can offer institutional
solutions to the problems of drugs, crime and poverty that are
plaguing the nation's major cities.
   ``Every conservative in America must confront the reality that
the great age of opposition conservatism is over,'' he said.
``Goldwater and Reagan won the argument, and now the country wants
us to govern. We must come up with a wave of reforms of
extraordinary scale.''

<HEAD>More than One Woman in Five Gets Poverty Benefits</HEAD>

   American women are more likely to need
anti-poverty assistance than men, as they struggle to raise
children on their own and cope with leaner times in old age, a
Census Bureau report shows.
   More than one woman in five _ 20.5 percent _ received help from
some major benefits program during a 32-month study reported on by
the Bureau on Thursday.
   During the same period the public assistance programs aided 15.8
percent of men in the nation, somewhat less than one out of six.
   John M. McNeil of the Bureau's Housing and Household Economic
Statistics Division said that the difference in need is largely the
result of women raising children without a husband present and the
preponderance of women in the older age groups.
   When marriages break up women more often obtain custody of the
children, and those families more often lapse into poverty, McNeil
said in a telephone interview. In addition, a growing number of
single women are raising families of their own, he noted.
   As of 1987, the bureau said, 34.3 percent of families with a
female householder fell below the poverty level. By comparison,
12.5 percent of families with a male householder and no wife, and
only 6.0 percent of married couples fell below the poverty level.
   The analysis showed that more than two-thirds of people living
in a female-headed household with no husband present throughout the
study period received anti-poverty benefits _ 67.1 percent.
   The study found that 18.3 percent of all Americans received
benefits from at least one of six programs studied. Included were
general assistance, Aid to Families with Dependent Children,
Supplemental Security Income, Medicaid, federal food stamps and
federal and state rent assistance.
   Benefits were more likely to go to minorities, to the very young
and to people who had not finished high school, according to the
report which covered the period from late 1983 to early 1986.
   ``One of the more important findings was that the likelihood of
receiving benefits was very closely tied to the number of months in
which income fell below the poverty level,'' McNeil said. ``So, in
that sense, the programs appear to be providing benefits to those
who need them the most.''
   This was the first long-term look at recipients of benefits done
by the Bureau, and thus no past rates were available for
comparison, McNeil said. The study will be repeated in the future,
he said.
   Nearly half of black Americans obtained help from one or more
programs during the period, at 48.5 percent, the study said. By
comparison, the rate was 34.2 percent for Hispanics and 13.9
percent for white Americans.
   Blacks also were longer-term recipients of help, averaging 11.2
months of benefits during the study period. Hispanics averaged 7.4
months of benefits while it was 2.6 months for white recipients.
   Overall, women recipients averaged 4.4 months of benefits,
compared with 3.0 months for men.
   By age, people under age 18 were the leading group receiving
benefits at 26.6 percent _ and the subgroup under age 6 managed a
30.1 percent rate.
   Programs benefited 19.9 percent of people aged 18 to 24, while
in the 25 to 44 group the rate was 14.7 percent. For people aged 65
and over the rate was 17.9.
   Benefits were most needed by inner-city residents, at 23.7
percent. The rate was 20.5 percent in rural areas and fell to only
12.3 percent in the suburbs.
   By region, 20.7 percent of southerners received benefits,
followed by 18.0 percent in the West, 16.8 percent in the Northeast
and 16.7 percent in the Midwest.
   The study was based on repeated interviews with 19,900
households across the country.

<HEAD>Detroit Teamsters Official with two Convictions Named International
VP</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Detroit-area Teamsters official with two
convictions for union-related offenses has been named an
international vice president of the nation's largest union, raising
questions about its pledge to improve its image.
   The selection of George Vitale by Teamsters President William J.
McCarthy, though not announced by the union, was confirmed Thursday
by Teamsters sources. A Teamsters spokesman did not return
telephone calls seeking comment.
   The selection comes in the wake of the settlement of a
racketeering suit against the Teamsters and a pledge by its leaders
to back election reforms and refurbish the union's image.
   ``McCarthy surely could have done better than to go out and
appoint a guy who has been convicted of taking payoffs both from
employers and stealing the union members' money,'' said Ken Paff of
Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a dissident union group based in
Detroit.
   Vitale, president of Teamsters Local 283 in Wyandotte, Mich.,
was convicted twice in the early 1970s, for accepting an illegal
payment from a Teamsters employer and for illegal use of union
funds in a plan to buy his wife a car. He received fines and
probation for both convictions but was allowed to keep his union
job.
   The prosecutor who handled the racketeering case raised the
possibility that a court-appointed administrator agreed to as part
of the settlement could review the Vitale appointment.
   ``The court-appointed administrator will have the authority to
review the appointment and to discipline any Teamster officials,''
said assistant U.S. attorney Randy Mastro. ``There is no statute of
limitations on the right to discipline.''
   The appointment of an administrator is expected to be made in
the next two weeks. That is one of three court-appointed monitoring
positions agreed to as part of the settlement of the racketeering
suit, which alleged widespread organized crime influence on the
Teamsters.
   Critics within the union characterized the Vitale appointment as
a slap at former Teamsters Vice President Robert Holmes Sr. of
Detroit. Holmes resigned in January in return for being dropped as
a defendant in the suit.
   Holmes opposed McCarthy's election to succeed the late Jackie
Presser as Teamsters president. Vitale reportedly had a falling out
with Holmes in recent years.
   McCarthy under Teamsters bylaws can fill vacancies on the
union's General Executive Board _ which consists of the president,
secretary-treasurer and 16 international vice presidents _ subject
to board approval. He has a solid majority on the board because of
recent turnover and has two vacancies still to fill.

   Two college seniors had no trouble finding
volunteers for research on their thesis, but some subjects were
surprised to learn they couldn't discern between cheap and
expensive domestic beers.
   ``We figured that college students are experts on beer drinking
and they would determine the difference in the five brands of
domestic beer we tested,'' said Aristotle Economon, who shared the
project with his brother, Andrew.
   ``But, statistically, people couldn't tell the difference,'' he
said.
   ``Free beer'' fliers were posted around the University of
Houston campus and drew a predictable crowd, and 265 students ended
up volunteering for the project.
   The sample was pared down to 191 students who said they drank
five or more beers each week, and each participant was given
3-ounce sample cups of five different brands of U.S. beer to
measure for body, aftertaste, sweetness, bitterness and strength.
   ``Some people would say, `This is great, I can buy cheap beer
and get just as good a product,''' he said. But others won't accept
it ``because people are very loyal to their brand of beer.''
   He would not reveal the brand names of beers tested, but said
they ranged in price from $1.60 to $3.20 a six-pack.

   Legislation to make Myakka fine sand
Florida's official state soil cleared the Senate, but not before
senior members ``sandbagged'' the bill and threw some verbal dirt
at its sponsor.
   It was all in good fun, however, and part of an initiation rite
of sorts for new lawmakers when a vote is taken on their first
bill. When the laughter died down Thursday, Sen. Sherry Walker's
bill was passed unanimously and sent to the House.
   As Sen. Larry Plummer rose to question whether south Florida was
included in the legislation, the funeral home operator noted that
``Everyone knows in my business I'm an expert on dirt.''
   Sen. Peter Weinstein called a halt to the fun and moved for a
vote on the measure, saying, ``It appears to me the members of the
Senate are trying to sandbag this bill.''
   If it receives House approval, Maykka sand will take its place
alongside the moonstone as Florida's official gem, the Florida
panther as the state animal, the mockingbird as the state bird and
orange juice as the official beverage.

<TEXT>
   After only 100 days, it's hard to tell if
President Bush's foreign policy is intentionally uninspiring or if
he is simply taking his time coming to conclusions about America's
role in the world.
   He has pulled back from the polemics of his predecessor, Ronald
Reagan, and in a few as yet inconclusive ways, such as a toughening
stand toward Israel, indicated that he just might adopt a foreign
policy that is substantively different from the one he inherited.
   On the other hand, these changes are so slight it could turn out
that Bush has no bold initiatives in mind, and that like President
Gerald R. Ford in the mid-1970s he intends mostly to mark time in
the foreign field.
   An overseas crisis could intervene, forcing Bush to improvise a
response that could lead to a dramatic shift in U.S. policy. The
rise to power in Moscow in 1985 of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, for
instance, impelled Reagan to drop his denunciations of the Soviet
Union as an evil empire. The result was a series of negotiations
that produced a lessening of tensions and the banning of U.S. and
Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   So far, international events have not conspired to draw Bush
into major decisions. A political scandal in Japan and growing West
German distaste for nuclear weapons could produce severe strains,
but Bush has given no sign of a shift in U.S. support for Japan or
U.S. determination to modernize Lance missiles in Europe.
   Bush has worked out a temporary deal with Congress to supply the
Nicaraguan rebels with $49.8 million in non-military aid and he has
endorsed an Israeli proposal for elections among Palestinian Arabs
to implement self-rule on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Both are stopgap measures. They beg the question whether Bush
will pursue the Reagan policy of trying to topple the Marxist
government in Nicaragua or is willing to live with it, and whether
he will try to force Israel and the Arabs into a lasting agreement.
   The Contra aid package, the product of a March 24 agreement
between the administration and the Democratic-led Congress, is good
only until the Fall. Nicaragua could make enough political
concessions by then to get Uncle Sam off its back _ and spare Bush
a difficult decision.
   Less likely is that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
election plan will induce the Palestinians and their supporters to
adopt a gradual and peaceful approach to settling the West Bank and
Gaza problem. Bush has already declared himself opposed to Israeli
``occupation'' of sovereignty over the territories.
   This could be a sign that he intends to pressure Israel to yield
control. But there is no hint of a U.S. peace plan, of shuttle
diplomacy by Secretary of State James A. Baker III, or that Bush
will summon Arab and Israeli leaders to Camp David, as President
Jimmy Carter did in 1978 to help squeeze out the peace treaty
between Israel and Egypt a year later.
   Bush and Baker evidently are committed to the proposition that
direct negotiations between Israel and Palestinians offer the best
hope for an agreement that would hold up. High-profile U.S.
diplomacy is not part of the picture at this point.
   In the important sphere of U.S.-Soviet relations, Gorbachev's
troop and missile reduction initiatives are receiving a skeptical
response. But NATO and the Warsaw Pact opened negotiations in
Vienna in March to trim tank and artillery units, and Baker
probably will set a date for the resumption of U.S.-Soviet talks on
long-range nuclear weapons when he goes to Moscow May 11.
   Gorbachev has the implicit support of the U.S. administration as
he consolidates his powers.
   This week, for instance, the State Department described his
purge of 74 Central Committee voting members and the promotion of
several proteges as dramatic. It expressed hope that ``whatever
changes occur, their effect is to strengthen and promote the reform
process in the Soviet Union toward greater democratization and
openness.''
   Bush, meanwhile, is encouraging reform in Poland with a series
of moves that could ease the Soviet ally's $39 billion foreign
debt. `'Liberty is an idea whose time has come in Eastern Europe,''
he said in a speech last week.
   He probably will visit Poland and Hungary this summer to
maintain U.S. support for change.

   Many babies born to mothers who use drugs are
becoming ``boarders'' who strain staffs and facilities in urban
hospitals after being abandoned by their parents, a hospital
director told Congress.
   ``The problem that my hospital and hospitals in cities around
the country are facing daily is caring for those newborn babies
abandoned by drug abusing mothers,'' said Haynes Rice, director of
Howard University Hospital.
   Rice on Thursday told the House Select Committee on Children,
Youth and Families that the overcrowding caused by these ``boarder
babies'' has become so acute one day he was unable to locate an
empty bed anywhere between Philadelphia and Richmond for an acutely
ill infant.
   Boarder babies are children who remain in hospitals after birth
even though they are medically ready for discharge, he said.
   The problem is being exacerbated in the nation's capital by the
rising cross-generational family use of crack cocaine, said Rice.
   ``Now we are seeing 28- and 35-year-old grandmothers who are
themselves substance abusers and who cannot readily step in to
provide the social support as in the past.''
   An internal study found the average stay for 27 of the 45 babies
being boarded at Howard between August and December 1988 was 42.3
days. The average expected hospital stay for a newborn is three
days.
   ``The longest-stay infant had been in the hospital for 245 days
at a cost in excess of $250,000,'' said Rice, noting the Medicaid
payment received by the hospital was set at $6,100 regardless of
the length of stay or extent of services the child received while
there.
   Rice recommended streamlining foster care and adoption
procedures to speed the placement of boarder babies into stable
homes.
   This is not a new phenomenon, he said, explaining that 20 years
ago ``when I worked in New York City, the public hospitals there
had about 200 babies on a daily basis who had been abandoned at the
hospitals by heroin addicted mothers.''
   Wendy Chavkin, a New York City doctor, said a recent report by
the city comptroller shows the problem has not abated, indicating
maternal drug use was the reason for the boarder status of 49
percent of the more than 300 children under age 2 in city hospitals.
   Chavkin said the lack of drug treatment facilities for women in
general and pregnant women specifically also contributes to the
problem.

   He is the mystery man of the nation's
worst oil spill, the third mate who was on watch when the Exxon
Valdez ran aground and dumped more than 10 million gallons of crude
in Prince William Sound.
   Little has been seen of Gregory Cousins since the March 24
accident, and federal officials don't expect him to surface until
the May 16-19 hearings in Anchorage to assess what happened and how
to prevent a recurrence.
   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, who the Coast Guard says was the only
person aboard authorized to navigate the tanker through the sound,
blamed his third mate when the Coast Guard radioed his ship an hour
after the wreck.
   ``Joe Hazelwood here,'' the skipper answered when Coast Guard
Cmdr. Steve McCall in Valdez asked for a damage report.
   ``A little problem here with the third mate, but we're working
our way off the reef,'' said Hazelwood, who tried to rock the ship
free before shutting down the engines and waiting for help.
   Cousins had signed on with Exxon as a third mate, although he
had obtained his second mate's certification Jan. 12.
   ``That's not unusual,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Gary Kaminski
in Washington, D.C. ``With fewer positions available, people set
sail at positions lower than their license.''
   A second mate is the navigator and is in charge of maps and
charts. The third mate is in charge of maintenance and the
inventory of firefighting equipment. They and the chief mate, who's
in charge of the cargo, alternate four-hour watches on the bridge.
   Hazelwood turned the 987-foot tanker and its 42 million gallons
of oil destined for Long Beach, Calif., over to Cousins sometime
after a state pilot with federal pilot authority left the ship at
Rocky Point.
   Bligh Reef was seven miles away.
   ``At that time the master (Hazelwood) was in the wheelhouse,''
said Coast Guard Cmdr. Darryle Waldron. ``The master had federal
pilotage (authority) for Prince William Sound through the entrance.
The mates didn't have the necessary endorsements on their
licenses.''
   The pilots used to navigate ships out of the sound to the Gulf
of Alaska until the 1980s when a smaller ship taking a pilot back
to Valdez capsized in rough seas. The pilot nearly died, and the
rules were eased.
   Cousins, reportedly a resident of Tampa, Fla., was licensed out
of New Orleans and obtained his third mate's license March 19,
1986. Coast Guard records in Washington, D.C., showed he had no
record of disciplinary action.
   Cousins is still employed by Exxon, said spokesman Joe Tucker,
but the oil company refused to say where he is working or living.
Hazelwood was dismissed after he tested at .06 on a blood-alcohol
test nine hours after the wreck. The legal limit on blood-alcohol
tests for ship captains is .04.
   Alan Pollock of the National Transportation Safety Board said he
doubted Hazelwood would attend the NTSB's hearing in Anchorage.
   ``If a witness is simply going to sit on the stand and take the
Fifth (Amendment right against self-incrimination) all day ... We'd
rather have people give us information. That looks like the case
with Hazelwood,'' Pollock said.
   Hazelwood faces three misdemeanor charges stemming from the
accident, including operating a vessel while under the influence.
   Cousins was a more likely participant in the NTSB hearing, said
Pollock. Other NTSB officials confirmed the agency has talked with
Cousins and hopes to have a longer interview before the May hearing.

<HEAD>Laser Erases Tattoos Without Scars or Pain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new laser technique erases tattoos but spares
the skin, providing the first way to get rid of battleships,
hearts, old lovers' names or other such decorations without causing
scars, researchers say.
   The treatment uses an intense beam of light called a ruby laser
to blast away the colors beneath the skin.
   ``I think this is the first truly non-scarring therapy for
tattoos,'' said Dr. R. Rox Anderson of Massachusetts General
Hospital.
   Dr. Charles Taylor, a member of Anderson's research team,
planned to present the results of the laser treatment today at a
meeting of the Society for Investigative Dermatology in Washington.
   Doctors said the laser is almost painless, too. It produces a
sensation something like a loosely snapped rubber band.
   Lasers are already widely used for removing tattoos, but current
models burn them off, leaving permanent scars. The new technique
also produces high heat, but its effects are much more selective.
   It uses brief, 100 million-watt flashes of red light, which is
absorbed by the tattoo pigment. The heat shatters the bits of
pigment imbedded in the skin as well as the cells that hold them.
But it does not harm blood vessels or ordinary cells.
   ``There is clearly a difference between this and other therapies
that are used,'' Anderson said.
   Anderson said the procedure could become the standard treatment
for removing tattoos after it is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, perhaps within two years.
   Dr. Kenneth Arndt of Beth Israel Hospital in Boston agreed.
   ``When the ruby laser works well, which looks to be a good deal
of the time, the skin remains normal,'' he said. ``That's
extraordinary, and it's bringing fancy technology to the level
where it can be useful for patient care.''
   Anderson said that in testing so far on 13 people, the laser
completely erased about half of the tattoos and faded the rest.
   However, he said the initial study was intended to find the
proper intensity of laser light, and some patients received
relatively low doses. Results may be better when higher levels are
used routinely.
   Of 41 tatoos treated, only one small patch of skin measuring
less than a square inch became scarred.
   The laser will not remove red pigment because it does not absorb
the red light. Amateur tattoos come off more easily than
professionally drawn tattoos, which contain more color.
   Anderson said that after his team began experimenting with the
ruby laser, they discovered that a group of doctors in Glasgow,
Scotland, had worked on the same approach and published preliminary
results in a British journal.
   Unless burned or removed surgically, tattoos are permanent. The
Boston researchers said that most of the people they have treated
so far got them while drunk.
   One woman had her boyfriend's initials tattooed when she was a
teen-ager. The next day she regretted it, and always kept the
tattoo covered with a bandage.
   Tattoos are drawn by puncturing the skin, usually with needles,
and inserting pigment that remains after the wound heals over.
   The variety of laser used in the new treatment was once widely
tested for medical purposes, but none of them seemed to work and it
was abandoned. The ruby laser is used largely for welding.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Terry Branstad has taken the final
step to launch floating casinos on Iowa's rivers and lakes.
   He declared ``the integrity of the state will be protected'' as
more than 50 backers watched him Thursday sign the bill legalizing
gambling on casino boats.
   ``I couldn't be happier,'' said Rep. Tom Fey, an author of the
gambling bill that culminated a four-year drive. ``It took a long,
hard effort.''
   ``This bill will provide an economic shot in the arm for many
river communities that wish to further promote tourism,'' Branstad
said. ``Our major rivers are already prime tourist destination
points and this bill would attract even more tourists to these
locations.''
   Jubilant backers predicted historic 19th century riverboats
would be luring thousands of tourists and millions of dollars to a
state that's suffered from years of farm-based economic hard times.
   ``In two years we'll see a major economic benefit to eastern
Iowa,'' said House Majority Leader Robert Arnould, a Davenport
Democrat.
   For his part, Branstad focused on economic development, tourism
and controls which limit each bet to $5 and nightly losses to $200.
   The governor rejected suggestions floating casinos are out of
place in the conservative middle of the nation's heartland.
   ``I'm very sensitive to that,'' said Branstad. ``I'm very proud
of the pristine reputation our state has.''
   Under the new law, riverboats could begin operating in 1991 and
would be regulated by the state's Racing Commission, which would
issue gambling licenses. Before any license could be issued, voters
in the county where it would dock would have to approve.
   Criticism came from a coalition of conservative Republicans who
fought it on moral grounds and liberal church groups who feared
exploitation of the poor.
   The riverboat gambling measure is the latest form of legalized
gambling to win approval in Iowa, which already has a state-run
lottery and parimutuel betting at horse and dog tracks.

   Pope John Paul II left Friday on his fifth African
tour for Madagascar, where violent protests against the government
of President Didier Ratsiraka the last week have left five people
dead.
   The pontiff's special Alitalia Boeing 747 left Rome's Leonardo
da Vinci Airport at 8 a.m. for a nine-hour flight to Madagascar's
capital, Antananarivo.
   It is the first stop on a nine-day trip that also will take the
pope to the French island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean, and to
Zambia and Malawi. It is the 41st foreign pilgrimage of John Paul's
10{-year papacy.
   In all, the pope will deliver 36 speeches and travel 13,500
miles during his trip. He is scheduled to return to Rome on May 6.
   Africa is the continent where Roman Catholicism is growing
fastest. The Vatican says it has 75 million followers in Africa.

   Aunt Jemima's down-home style is giving way to a
more sophisticated look.
   Gone are the geometric-print headband and plain white collar.
The ``new'' Aunt Jemima wears gold-trimmed pearl earrings, a lace
collar and soft, wavy, gray-streaked hair.
   Quaker Oats Co., home to this ageless black woman since 1926, is
updating the 100-year-old trademark.
   But she still looks like she knows her way around the kitchen,
company spokesman Ronald G. Bottrell said Thursday.
   And her smiling face _ adorning 40 breakfast products from
pancakes to syrup to grits _ is the same. It didn't change much in
1968, either, when Quaker gave the once-portly icon a more svelte
look.
   So why bother?
   It was time, says Quaker.
   The time comes about every 20 years.
   Five months of consumer research in 12 cities ``showed very high
awareness of the Aunt Jemima trademark and positive perceptions
among all groups,'' said Barbara R. Allen, vice president for
marketing in Quaker's convenience foods division.
   The new design, which will begin appearing in July, ``gives our
Aunt Jemima line a more contemporary look as we move into the
1990s,'' she said.
   Consumers surveyed were offered two or three choices for a
revamped Aunt Jemima, none of them dramatically different because
Quaker wanted to keep the ``good will and positive perceptions that
already existed,'' Bottrell said.
   The consumers had firm notions about her.
   Some described Aunt Jemima as ``a young grandmother,'' he said.
   ``She works, she has a family,'' others suggested.
   But the consensus across the board was that ``she definitely
knows how to cook,'' Bottrell said.
   ``In order for this to have any credibility, people need to
expect that of Aunt Jemima,'' he said. ``We wanted a more
modern-looking woman, but one who still has traditional values.
   The original Aunt Jemima Pancake Mix was introduced in 1889, a
breakthrough convenience product from the R.T. Davis Milling Co. in
St. Joseph, Mo., where it is still made by Quaker.
   Today, Aunt Jemima is the leading brand in both pancake mixes
and syrups, offering low-calorie variations and microwave
convenience, the company said. Her products represent about $300
million of Quaker's $5.3 billion in sales.

<HEAD>New AIDS Drug to be Tested in Humans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is allowing a
potentially promising new AIDS drug to be tested on people infected
with the deadly virus.
   Researchers say the drug, known as GLQ223, is unique because it
appears to kill only those immune system cells that are infected
with the AIDS virus, leaving non-infected cells alone. However,
they caution the drug so far has been tested only in the laboratory
and has not been used on AIDS patients.
   Dr. Michael McGrath of the University of California in San
Francisco and San Francisco General Hospital led a team of
scientists from UCSF, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and
Genelabs of Redwood City, Calif., that developed GLQ223.
   ``I'm very optimistic because of the test tube results, but
there's always the possibility it could have unpredictable side
effects or when given to humans the drug may not be able to get to
all the infected cells,'' McGrath said of Thursday's announcement.

<NOTE>Brady Rejects Proposal to Reduce Medicare Catastrophic Surtax</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is rejecting
a proposal to reduce Medicare ``catastrophic'' health insurance
premiums that congressional analysts expect to generate a bigger
surplus than is needed.
   Brady, in a letter to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas that was
released Thursday, said the insurance program ``is literally in its
first few months of life'' and the administration wants to be sure
it is not left with insufficient reserves.
   The new insurance program, approved by Congress last year,
provides extended coverage for the costs of hospital and medical
care and drug benefits. It is financed through a surtax paid by
Social Security recipients.
   Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, last week
said he would move to reduce the surtax if the Treasury Department
agreed with new congressional estimates that the surtax will yield
a $9.1 billion surplus over a five-year period.
   Brady, however, said the administration expects the premiums to
yield ``contingency reserves'' of $6.2 billion and finds no reason
to revise that estimate or to allow for a smaller surplus.

   Georgetown University basketball coach John
Thompson revealed he met with an alleged drug kingpin and asked him
to steer clear of his players after learning that several members
of his team were frequenting a bar where drug trafficking is common.
   Thompson, appearing on an ABC-TV program on the violent drug
problem in Washington, said Thursday he spoke with 24-year-old
Rayful Edmond III, after learning that Georgetown players were
socializing at Chapter III, a nightclub where both college students
and alleged drug dealers regularly gather.
   Thompson describes the result as ``almost like a tacit
agreement: `Do me a favor: If you see anything going on out there,
use whatever resources you have to stop it from happening.'''
   Thompson, who coached the U.S. basketball team in the 1988
Olympics in Seoul, said he met with Edmond in February. On April
15, Edmond and 15 others were arrested and charged with running a
massive transcontinental cocaine ring.

<TEXT>
   A West German described by U.S.
authorities as ``the world's top techno-bandit'' was sentenced to
an additional 2{ years in prison and fined $40,000 for a daring
helicopter prison escape attempt.
   U.S. District Judge William Stafford sentenced Werner
Bruchhausen, 49, to 30-month concurrent sentences Thursday on each
of two counts of conspiracy to escape. The term will be tacked onto
a 15-year term Bruchhausen received in 1987 for sales of classified
technology to Soviet bloc countries.
   Stafford criticized letters he got on behalf of Bruchhausen
which were critical of the U.S. judicial system, saying, ``I
thought I ought to let you know this system has provided you with a
fair trial.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Dobson urged the judge to exceed
sentencing guidelines, which called for a maximum prison term of 30
months. He discounted the defense contention that Bruchhausen was
entrapped.
   ``He was the person who initiated the plan,'' said Dobson.
   Defense attorney Bruce Culpepper, who asked the judge to stay
within the guidelines, said no decision had been made on an appeal.
   Authorities foiled Bruchhausen's escape by setting up a U.S.
Customs helicopter as the escape aircraft. He had reportedly
offered to pay up to $250,000 for assistance.
   Bruchhausen was taken into custody by an FBI agent and four
prison officers as he started toward the aircraft that had swooped
down over the softball field in the prison recreation yard last
August. He was later transferred to the federal penitentiary in
Atlanta.
   The West German citizen began serving his sentence at the
Tallahassee prison in May 1987.
   Bruchhausen and three others were indicted in August 1981 in Los
Angeles on charges of conspiracy and violating the Export
Administration Act, the Arms Export and Control Act and federal
income tax laws.
   The 60-count indictment charged that from January 1977 through
June 5, 1980, Bruchhausen and the others ``conspired to export from
the United States various high technology commodities'' to East
Germany and elsewhere without export licenses from the State and
Commerce departments.
   At that time, U.S. Customs Commissioner William von Rabb called
Bruchhausen ``one of the world's top techno-bandits.''
   He was arrested on May 8, 1985, in London, extradited the
following year and convicted of wire fraud in 1987.
   Bruchhausen allegedly smuggled a microwave receiver system,
semiconductor manufacturing equipment, a computer system and other
military and scientific items to the Soviet bloc through dummy
corporations in California and West Germany.

<HEAD>Dollar Up As Nikkei Gains 212 Points To Hit High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen
Friday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange hit yet
another high.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
65.90 points for a 33,500.83-point record close Thursday, gained
another 212.52 points, or 0.63 percent, to finish the week at
33,713.35.
   The dollar closed at 132.49 yen, up 0.44 yen from the previous
day's close of 132.05 yen. It started at 132.20 yen and ranged from
132.20 to 132.60 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's surge came as concern briefly
subsided about an immediate increase in Japan's official discount
rate following the release of April's Tokyo-area consumer price
report.
   Consumer prices for April in Tokyo rose 2.6 percent from a year
earlier and 1.4 percent from the prior month, according to a
government report released Friday.
   ``The figures were largely within that of an anticipated range
... but many investors were still taking a cautious position on a
possible interest rate hike,'' said a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo, who spoke anonymously.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a news conference Friday
that the nation's central bank is worried about price stability and
high oil prices. But the tone of his remarks also suggested there
will not be an immediate change in monetary policy based on the
price data.
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said Thursday the central
bank would act swiftly, if necessary, to sustain price stability.
   The major national newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported Friday
that the Bank of Japan is likely to hike its official interest
rate, now standing at a historic low of 2.5 percent, to 3.0 percent
as early as mid-May to alleviate inflationary pressure.
   On the stock exchange, the market's main barometer started on a
strong note following a 29.88-point rise in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average in New York overnight, dealers said.
   They said the stock market also welcomed the fact that April's
Tokyo-area consumer index was well below an originally expected
increase of 3-3.5 percent, helping to temporarily ease the
inflationary concern.

<HEAD>Heart Disease Rates Highest In Northeast, Lowest Out West</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you're trying to stay away from a heart
attack, federal health researchers say your chances are best out
West.
   Hawaii's rate of death from heart disease is barely half the
rate in New York, which reports three such deaths per 1,000
residents per year, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said
Thursday.
   After Hawaii, rounding out the healthiest-heart list are New
Mexico, Utah, Alaska and Idaho.
   The CDC's findings, from a study of heart disease deaths in
1986, the latest year available, mark a continuation of previously
reported trends in coronary mortality. Also continuing is a trend
with heart disease deaths going down, while hospitalizations for
heart disease are rising, the Atlanta-based agency said in its
weekly report.
   The nation in 1986 recorded 593,111 deaths from coronary heart
disease, chiefly heart attacks and other blocked-artery heart
problems, accounting for 28 percent of all deaths in the United
States, the CDC said.
   By comparison, cancer, the nation's No. 2 killer, took 466,000
lives in 1986.
   The CDC study found the highest rate of heart disease deaths in
New York state, which recorded 58,473 such deaths, or 303 per
100,000 residents. The other states in the top five were all in the
Northeast or the northern Midwest: Michigan, with a rate of 299
heart disease deaths per 100,000; Rhode Island, 284; New Jersey,
278; and Illinois, 274.
   The national rate was 246 heart disease deaths per 100,000
Americans.
   Hawaii had the lowest rate of heart disease deaths, with 1,403,
or 166 per 100,000. Next up the list were four other western
states: New Mexico, 184; Utah, 189; Alaska, 190; and Idaho, 190.
   CDC researchers say people in more populous areas are more
likely to have inactive lifestyles _ holding desk jobs, riding
instead of walking _ which can contribute to the risk of heart
attack or heart disease.
   ``We really don't know what the reason is,'' said Dr. Robert
Hahn, a CDC researcher. ``We suspect some of the risk factors for
heart disease may be found more commonly in those regions.''
   The CDC also reported Thursday that while deaths from heart
disease have declined 20 percent since 1968, the rate of
hospitalization from heart disease has risen.
   Among men, the hospitalization rate for heart disease was 1,066
per 100,000 nationwide in 1986, up from 784 in 1970. Among women,
the rate was 718 in 1986, up from 570 in 1970. Men are consistently
hospitalized for heart disease at a rate 50 percent higher than
women.
   The decrease in deaths from heart disease probably represents
``diminishing incidence,'' but with medical advances, more heart
disease patients than ever before seem to be getting hospital
treatment, said the CDC's Dr. Richard M. Rothenberg.
   ``It's an interesting social trend,'' he said. ``It has a lot to
do with (trends in) disease, mixed with hospital policies. ... We
really need more research trying to pinpoint what is actually going
on.''
   The increase in recorded heart-disease hospitalizations could be
because of a number of factors, the CDC said, including improved
survival of heart patients, progress in medical technology and even
changes in hospital procedures and classification systems.

   An expert advisory panel recommends federal
approval of birth control implants that work up to five years, but
a final decision by Food and Drug Commissioner Frank Young may take
months.
   Among the issues the agency still must review are the
effectiveness of the implants in heavier women and how long the
contraceptive protection lasts, FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said
Thursday.
   Nesbit said the 11-member Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs
Advisory Committee of the FDA unanimously approved the implant,
called Norplant, because it is at least as safe and effective as
any other contraceptive on the market
   The six slow-release silicone capsules, each about the size of a
match stick, are implanted under a local anesthetic in a woman's
upper arm. They must be replaced after five years.
   Norplant, already being used in several foreign countries,
contains a hormone called levonorgestrel that is also used in many
birth control pills. But unlike the pills, it does not contain
estrogen, the hormone often implicated as a possible cause of heart
attacks and strokes.
   The Population Council, a non-profit international family
planning organization, sought FDA approval of Norplant so it could
be distributed overseas by the U.S. Agency for International
Development. The implant is made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of
Philadelphia.
   The Population Council says that in tests, the implants have
been 99.8 percent effective over five years in women weighing less
than 110 pounds, and 91.4 percent effective in women weighing more
than 153 pounds.

<HEAD>Aloha Airlines Accident Changed Industry Philosophy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the year since the roof ripped off an Aloha
Airlines jet and a flight attendant plunged to her death,
widespread changes have occurred in the industry that once believed
a maintained aircraft could fly forever.
   The Boeing 737 involved had rolled off the assembly line in 1969
and had 89,000 cycles _ takeoffs and landings _ in a corrosive
salt-air environment.
   The industry and the Federal Aviation Administration had
believed that metal fatigue in older airplanes, especially cracking
around rivets and corrosion, could be discovered in regular visual
inspections.
   However, in the Aloha case, investigators think dozens of minute
cracks _ invisible to the human eye _ connected and allowed a piece
of fuselage to blow out in an explosive decompression at 24,000
feet, followed by a whole section of the plane.
   The images from the April 28, 1988, accident were unforgettable:
the jet, with a 18-foot chunk of its upper fuselage gone, sitting
on the runway of Kahului Airport on the Hawaiian Island of Maui;
stunned passengers milling around while flight attendants tried to
comfort them; passengers shaking the hands of the pilot and
co-pilot who somehow landed the crippled jet safely.
   Officials were stunned there was only one fatality, although 61
passengers were injured.
   Quickly the headlines changed from ``Terror in Paradise,'' to
``Miracle Over Maui.'' Experts marveled at the skill of the
captain, Robert Schornstheimer, and the co-pilot, Madeline ``Mimi''
Tompkins, since promoted to captain, and praised them for averting
a much worse disaster. And they wondered, of course, what could
cause the 19-year-old jet to break apart.
   ``I saw the original hole, the smaller one before the whole
thing ripped open,'' said passenger Arlo Clippinger, 51, of Tucson,
Ariz. ``I still dream about that hole.''
   After the accident, a task force of aviation industry and
government safety experts recommended mandatory structural
overhauls on older airliners. The average age of the nearly 3,000
U.S. airliners is about 13 years, with many planes more than 15
years old.
   The National Transportation Safety Board report on the
``in-flight roof separation'' is not due until next month.
   ``The accident caused everyone to question the industry folklore
that a plane could fly forever,'' said A. Maurice Myers, president
of Aloha Airlines.
   ``Now it's believed that airplanes can fly indefinitely with the
proper life-extending programs, but that's not just daily
maintenance, it's overall, complete structural inspections,'' he
said.
   Since the Aloha accident, nine people died Feb. 24 when the
cargo door and a chunk of fuselage tore off an United Airlines
Boeing 747 on a flight from Hawaii. Cargo door failure is suspected
to be the cause of that mishap.
   ``Those two accidents (United and Aloha) were similar only in
what you saw on TV, a jet with a hole,'' said FAA spokesman Fred
Farrar. ``The best poll of public confidence remains the fact that
we have something like 16,000 airline flights every day in the
country and they're pretty much full of passengers.''
   Meanwhile, Boeing Co. this week predicted record sales for 1989,
with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank Shrontz saying
``concern about aging aircraft is bound to be a significant
factor'' in the company's sales outlook.
   Myers said that despite spending $60 million for two new 737s,
defending the company against 19 lawsuits stemming from the
accident and spending millions to refurbish older aircraft, the
company turned a $5.8 million profit in 1988, up $200,000 from the
previous year's profit.
   The jet involved in the accident was scrapped, and the airline
no longer lists a Flight 243 in its schedule.
   The airline's insurance company is paying settlements to those
who did not sue, Myers said, but declined to release the average
payment.
   ``In 43 years of flying we've had one accident,'' Myers said.
``It happened to be one that affected the whole industry and caused
widespread changes.''

<TEXT>
   Civil rights leaders are suing the state
of Connecticut contending its schools make it impossible for poor,
minority students to get the same education as their white,
suburban counterparts.
   The desegregation lawsuit was filed Thursday in Hartford
Superior Court on behalf of a black Hartford fourth-grader and 16
other children and teen-agers, arguing that racial imbalance in
Hartford area schools violates the state constitution's guarantee
against racial discrimination.
   The lawsuit contends that black and Hispanic inner-city children
and white suburban children are all suffering under greater
Hartford's racially divided school systems.
   ``Black children going to black schools and white children going
to white schools is inherently unequal,'' said Wesley Horton, one
of 10 lawyers who will argue the case. ``It's got to be stopped.''
   The lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, 10-year-old Milo Sheff,
attends Hartford's Annie Fisher School, where 99 percent of the
students are black or Hispanic.
   Six of the 17 plaintiffs in the lawsuit are white, including two
children from West Hartford, an affluent suburb where schools are
84 percent white. In Hartford, where the other 15 plaintiffs live,
schools are 91 percent black or Hispanic.
   The lawsuit contends that the concentration of poor children,
children from one-parent families, and non-English speaking
children places severe burdens on the Hartford school system,
making it unable to provide education comparable to that offered in
nearby suburbs.
   The lawsuit also alleges that white children in suburban school
districts surrounding Hartford ``are deprived of the opportunity to
associate with, and learn from, the minority children attending
school within the Hartford school district.''
   The lawsuit does not ask for any specific remedy to desegregate
the schools, and the lawyers who will argue the case seemed
hesitant to suggest one.
   ``What we envision is a system whereby Puerto Ricans and blacks
and whites are educated together,'' said William Olds, executive
director of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, which is
providing two lawyers to the plaintiffs.
   A court-ordered solution could focus on redrawing school
district boundaries, busing students from one district to another,
or creating interdistrict ``magnet'' schools.
   State Education Commissioner Gerald H. Tirozzi, one of 10 state
officials named as defendants, has proposed voluntary, incremental
steps such as magnet schools to desegregate Connecticut schools.
But the Legislature has not acted on Tirozzi's suggestions, and
civil rights leaders maintain the Legislature won't deal with the
issue without pressure from the courts.
   Also named as defendants are Gov. William A. O'Neill, the six
current members of the state Board of Education, state Treasurer
Francisco L. Borges _ the state's highest black official _ and
state Comptroller J. Edward Caldwell.
   O'Neill's legal advisor, Howard G. Rifkin, said Thursday the
governor would have no comment on the lawsuit until he has had a
chance to review it.

   President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle
held a meeting last week to discuss how to handle a transfer of
presidential power if Bush were incapacitated, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater says.
   Fitzwater called the unannounced session April 18 ``just a
routine meeting, just a process meeting, how the process would
work.''
   The 25th Amendment to the Constitution prescribes circumstances
under which the vice president would assume power from the
president, and Bush temporarily took over from former President
Ronald Reagan when he had colon cancer surgery on July 13, 1985.
   Fitzwater said Thursday that ``precise guidelines'' were adopted
during the Reagan administration for implementing the Amendment.
   ``I don't know that there's anything (more) to decide,'' he
said. ``It's all very routine. The processes were worked out in the
last administration.''
   He said he did not recall that that process had ever been made
public. On the other hand, Fitzwater said he recalled talking about
the process when Reagan was undergoing periodic cancer checkups.
   Quayle, who was traveling in Australia, said of the report
today, ``I have absolutely no comment on that. I have no comment.''
   The Washington Post, quoting an anonymous White House source,
reported today that the meeting was kept secret because of
sensitivity to previous Democratic charges that Quayle lacked
experience to handle the job of president.
   Fitzwater said he did not know who participated in the meeting
but said it was a private session.
   The Post reported that Barbara Bush and Marilyn Quayle as well
as White House physician Burton Lee II and White House counsel C.
Boyden Gray also attended the meeting. According to the Post,
Quayle remained silent while his wife and the Bushes questioned the
White House staff members on the issue.
   A source familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of
anonymity told The Associated Press, however, that Mrs. Quayle did
not attend the session.
   During the meeting, it was determined that the 25th Amendment
would be invoked under certain circumstances but not in others, but
the details of what was decided could not be immediately
determined, the Post said.

<TEXT>
   Several widows of crew members aboard the
Challenger space shuttle say they are upset about plans by ABC to
make a three-hour television movie about the accident.
   Loran Onizuka, widow of Challenger astronaut Ellison Onizuka,
and Jane Smith, widow of Challenger pilot Michael Smith, and their
attorney have talked to George Englund, executive producer and
writer of the ABC drama, in an effort to get him to drop the
project.
   Englund, however, said the project to tell the story of the
seven astronauts who died in the accident Jan. 28, 1986, will
continue.
   ``In my heart, I've tried to understand their feeling,'' he
said. ``The most honorable thing I can say is that my hopes and
wishes are that it will be accurate.''
   But Mrs. Onizuka said, ``They ought to let them be.''
   ``Why do we have to relive this? Why don't they leave it alone?
If it is going to be done at all, it should be done as a very
serious documentary,'' added Mrs. Smith.
   Cheryl McNair, widow of Challenger astronaut Ronald McNair, said
the movie ``just doesn't seem necessary at this time.''
   Englund said the cast has not been selected and a start date has
not been set. But he hopes to film the entire movie in the Johnson
Space Center vicinity south of Houston.
   June Scobee, the widow of Challenger commander Francis ``Dick''
Scobee, talked with Englund for purposes of script research. But
Englund would not say whether the families of Challenger astronauts
Judith Resnik, Gregory Jarvis or schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe
talked with him.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Gets Money For Recommended Kits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The consumer group Public Citizen is getting
50 cents on the sale of each home-testing kit for radon from two
companies it is recommending as the best, The Washington Post
reported today.
   Bob Dreyfuss, a spokesman for the Ralph Nader-affiliated group,
admitted Public Citizen is accepting the money but told the Post
suggestions of a link between the payments and the favorable
ratings are ``totally without even the slightest foundation.''
   Public Citizen is an umbrella organization for several consumer
groups. One of those groups, Buyers Up, recommended the kits
produced by Radon Testing Corp. of America and Teledyne Isotops,
Dreyfuss said.
   According to Dreyfuss, Buyers Up tested seven radon-testing kits
from the nation's largest manufacturers last year and asked all of
the firms to contribute to Buyers Up or Public Citizen, both
nonprofit groups.
   Dreyfuss told the Post it was only coincidence that the only
firms to offer a percentage of their sales were those that won
recommendations.
   The National Consumer Coalition, a group of 33 conservative
consumer and public policy groups, has joined firms that were rated
poorly by Buyers Up in calling the arrangement a kickback.
   ``I suppose that there could be some better way of funding it,''
Dreyfuss said of the testing program. ``But we don't have any
regrets. They're seizing on this as a way to try to discredit us.''
   Radon is a colorless, odorless radioactive gas that forms
naturally from decay in the ground and can seep into homes.

<HEAD>Moderate Quake Felt In Six States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Dishes rattled and houses shook, but no damages or injuries were
reported from an earthquake centered in Missouri and felt in five
other states, authorities said.
   The earthquake hit at 11:48 a.m. CDT Thursday and measured 4.7
on the Richter scale of ground motion. It was centered in New
Madrid, Mo., 10 miles north of Blytheville, Ark.
   The temblor _ in Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri and Kentucky _
was the strongest in the region since 1976, said Pat Jorgenson,
spokeswoman for the U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake
Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   David Stewart, director of the Center for Earthquake Studies at
Southeast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau, Mo., said
the quake also was felt in Mississippi and Illinois.
   Mary Hester of Mayfield, Ky., about 20 miles north of the
Tennessee border, was perched on her roof, painting, when the
earthquake hit. The quake lasted about 15 seconds.
   ``There was a loud boom, and about that time everything went to
shaking. ... I don't know which was shaking worse _ me or the
house,'' Ms. Hester said.
   Pemiscot County Sheriff's Deputy Rodney Ivie in Missouri said
his office had received many calls, but none reporting damage or
injuries.
   ``They were worried because they weren't sure what it was,''
Ivie said. ``They had a pretty good idea, you know, but they wanted
to make sure.''
   The New Madrid seismic zone was the center of a series of great
earthquakes that rocked the area during the winter of 1811-12.
   Officials have warned repeatedly that a serious earthquake can
be expected during the next several years in the New Madrid seismic
area, which stretches roughly from southern Illinois to Arkansas.
   Thursday's was the strongest quake in the region since March 25,
1976, when one registered 4.9, said Jorgenson.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. So a reading of 7.5 means an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.
A 7 reading is a major earthquake, capable of widespread heavy
damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage.
   The Richter scale was unavailable in 1811-1812, but those quakes
have been estimated at 8.2 to 8.3 on the scale. The New Madrid
quakes affected much of the eastern United States, felt as far away
as Boston and Washington, D.C., but the immediate area then was
sparsely settled and there was relatively little local damage.

<TEXT>
   Lack of medicine and a shortage of
hospital beds hampered treatment today of the victims of a tornado
that pounded Bangladesh, leaving hundreds of people dead and
thousands injured, doctors said.
   The Relief Ministry says at least 600 people were killed and
12,000 injured Wednesday as the tornado swept through the Manikganj
area, 25 miles northwest of Dhaka.
   But local newspapers said the toll could reach 1,000. The
pro-government Janata newspaper quoted officials as saying bodies
were being uncovered in the rubble of devastated houses and that
several hundred of the injured were in critical condition.
   Doctors at the Dhaka Medical College, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said an acute shortage of medicine and hospital beds was
impeding treatment to the injured.
   They said at least 1,000 people were brought to the hospital on
Wednesday with broken limbs and head injuries. ``We could only
admit 225 of them,'' one doctor said. ``The rest were given
emergency treatment and released. Many of them did not get proper
medicine.''
   An Associated Press reporter saw many of the injured lying in
the corridors of the 1,000-bed hospital, which is considered
Dhaka's largest and most modern medical facility.
   ``My mother needs blood and an immediate operation,'' said a
sobbing Ahmed Ali, a 15-year-old boy. ``But no cot is available.''
   His mother, Ameena Begum, lay next to him on the corridor.
Doctors said she had sustained serious head injuries and was
periodically losing conciousness.
   Her husband, Mohammad Ali, and two other sons were killed in the
tornado. Ahmed Ali escaped with bruises.
   ``This is a terrible scene,'' said Mostafa Jala Mohiuddin, a
doctor at the medical college. ``I have never seen so many injured
people flooding the hospital at a time.''
   The tornado left at least 400 people missing, including 200
fishermen who had taken their boats on the Padma River, officials
at the Relief Ministry said.
   It also unleashed hailstones and heavy showers hours after
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad led nationwide prayers for rains
to ease a two-month-long drought.
   The drought threatens to destroy more than half of the rice crop
in this poverty-stricken nation.
   A smaller tornado blew through the Narsingdi district, 25 miles
east of Dhaka, killing five people and injuring 500 others, news
reports said.
   The government has asked for blood donations and has set up
makeshift camps in the affected areas, Relief Ministry officials
said.
   Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries with an annual
per capita income of $160, is often ravaged by both flood and
drought. It has a population of 110 million.
   Summer floods last year left four-fifths of the country under
water, killing at least 1,400 people. In November, cyclones claimed
another 1,100 lives.

<HEAD>Investigator: Dispatcher's Mistake Caused Derailment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mistake by a CSX Corp. dispatcher with 23
years experience caused the April 6 derailment of Amtrak's Silver
Star near Emporia, a federal investigator said.
   Gordon J. Inglis of the National Transportation Safety Board
said Thursday that the dispatcher, based at CSX's new central
dispatch center in Jacksonville, Fla., had radioed the engineer
that the Silver Star would be switching tracks in Emporia _ four
miles beyond the point where the switch had been set. Emporia is
about 50 miles south of Richmond.
   The engineer failed to slow for the switch because he didn't
expect it so soon, Inglis said.
   The train plowed into the switch at its normal cruising speed of
59 mph instead of the recommended crossover speed of 15 mph.
   Both engines and the first eight cars of the 18-car train jumped
the track, causing minor injuries to 34 of the train's 519
passengers and $1.8 million in damage.
   Inglis said tests found no evidence of drug or alcohol use by
anyone involved in the train's routing or operation.
   He said the dispatcher had a perfect work record before the
derailment. The man is still at his post and likely will keep his
job, the investigator said.
   The safety board's final report on the accident, due in June,
probably will recommend changes in operating procedures at the
dispatch center, Inglis said.
   CSX has about 19,000 miles of track in 20 states plus
Washington, D.C., and Ontario, Canada.

<TEXT>
   Red, white and blue will be the rage this
weekend as the 200th anniversary of George Washington's
inauguration is celebrated with a flotilla of ships, a fireworks
display and a parade led by President Bush.
   Washington's swearing-in as the first president was watched by
some 20,000, just 10,000 fewer than the city's population in 1789.
More than 2 million are expected to gather to watch the
bicentennial events.
   The highlight will be the inaugural commemoration at Federal
Hall on Sunday, marking the moment when Washington put his hand to
the Bible and swore to ``faithfully execute the office of president
of the United States.''
   Bush will speak at the ceremony _ which falls on his 101st day
in office. And a white-haired Philadelphian, William Sommerfield,
will play the part of Washington and deliver part of the first
president's inaugural address.
   The city kicks off the festivities Saturday with a flotilla in
New York Harbor. Thirteen U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships
representing the original states will be joined by 50 commercial
and civilian vessels coming down the Hudson River.
   At night, a fireworks spectacular called ``Hail to the Chief,''
narrated by Walter Cronkite, will emblazon the sky. Scenes of
pyrotechnics will tell the history of the presidency.
   Prior to Sunday's commemoration, Bush and other dignitaries will
attend an ecumenical service at St. Paul's Chapel, where Washington
prayed after his inauguration.
   After the ceremony, Bush will lead a parade that will include
the official bands of the Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two limpet mines exploded in
trash cans in downtown Johannesburg early today, shattering store
windows but causing no injuries, police said.
   The first explosion shortly after noon blew up a trash bin at
the entrance of a local department store. It occurred across from a
building housing several American and British news organizations,
including The Associated Press, CBS-TV, The New York Times and The
Times of London.
   The second explosion occurred two hours later in front of a
furnishing store seven blocks away.
   Bombings had dropped off sharply since a protest campaign last
October against the racially separate nationwide municipal
elections. While there had been no bombs in Johannesburg in months,
several were reported in the Cape area and in the Xhosa tribal
homelands of Ciskei and Transkei. Sixteen people have been injured
by about 20 bombs this year.
   Police named no suspect for today's bombings, although they
usually blame the outlawed African National Congress, the largest
guerrilla organization waging a sabotage campaign to end apartheid
and rule by a white-dominated government.
   The ANC seldom comments on individual bombings, but they
sometimes occur after an event considered significant to the
organization. Three ANC guerrillas were sentenced to death
Thursday, and a fourth received a 25-year prison sentence in
connection with four killings and two bombings that injured 17
people in 1986. The trial was in Delmas, a farm town northeast of
Johannesburg.

   A judge must now decide the fate of a man
after accepting his plea of guilty but mentally ill in the killings
of two 8-year-olds during a shooting at an elementary school last
fall.
   James Wilson, depicted as a man plagued by imaginary voices and
obsessed with violence, also was found guilty but mentally ill
Thursday of wounding seven other children and two teachers at
Greenwood's Oakland Elementary School.
   Wilson walked into the school on Sept. 26, 1988, and opened fire
with a handgun in a cafeteria and classroom.
   During a hearing after the judge accepted the pleas, prosecutors
asked that Wilson be sentenced to the electric chair, and the
defense asked for life in prison with proper psychiatric care.
   Circuit Judge James Moore delayed sentencing Wilson until May 9.
   Moore accepted the pleas from Wilson, 20, after 3{ days of
testimony from witnesses to the shooting and from psychiatrists who
had examined him. Earlier this week, Moore found Wilson competent
to stand trial.
   Wilson, who has a history of mental illness, offered a plea of
guilty but mentally ill to the charges on Monday. But Moore refused
to immediately accept the pleas, saying he wanted to hear testimony
on the defendant's state of mind.
   Psychiatrists testified that Wilson was a man obsessed by the
film, ``Psycho,'' which Wilson claimed to have seen 500 times,
fascinated by mass murderers and how they carried out their crimes,
and plagued by the voice of his dead grandfather.
   Psychiatrists called by the defense this week testified that
Wilson suffered from a borderline personality disorder, which
involves a potential for violence, low self-esteem, paranoia,
inability to develop interpersonal relationships and suicidal
tendencies.
   Prosecutors tried to dispel testimony that supported Wilson's
contention he was mentally ill at the time of the shootings in an
effort to send the case to a jury trial.

   A strong earthquake jolted central Greece
today but no damage or injuries were reported.
   The Athens Seismological Institute said the quake, which
occurred at 7:02 a.m., measured 5.0 on the Richter scale and was
centered in the Aegean Sea, about 85 miles north of the capital.
   ``We felt the quake but we had no reports of damage or
injuries,'' said a police officer in the central Greek port of
Volos.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance
with Greek practice, said, ``We have many Easter visitors here and
at the nearby islands and fortunately there was no panic.''
   More than 1 million Athenians have left the capital to spend the
weekend of the Greek Orthodox Easter in the countryside, police
said.
   A quake measuring 5.0 can cause considerable damage if its
epicenter is in a populated area. The Richter scale is a gauge of
the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground
motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number
means the ground motion is 10 times greater.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, acting like
a political candidate on a whistlestop tour of Australia, quaffed
beer at a local pub, hit tennis balls with underprivileged children
and mingled with crowds in two cities today.
   Obviously enjoying himself on the third day of his trip, Quayle
paid a surprise visit to the wood-paneled pub at the Lord Nelson
Brewery Hotel where his brief stop stunned the clientele.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said Kim Ivey, a banker who was
drinking at the bar with friends in mid-afternoon. ``We were
standing here and he walked up and said, `Hi. I'm Dan Quayle.'''
   Quayle, sipping a glass of Hahn beer, chatted with the young
women behind the bar, joked with proprietor Blair Hayden about his
golfing tie and suggested two patrons attend a black-tie dinner at
which he's the guest of honor.
   He called the beer _ which is Australia's national drink _ good,
but added, ``It has a bite.''
   Ann Larson, 25, an administrator at IBM who chatted with Quayle
said, ``It was great. He is really nice.'' She said her friends
``will be spewing. They'll be so jealous.''
   The pub stop capped a day in which Quayle spent much of his time
shaking hands and posing for pictures, including several on a boat
tour of Sydney's breathtaking harbor.
   The good-natured touring was in contrast to the first days of
Quayle's first trip to the Pacific region. The vice president has
highlighted the U.S.-Australia defense alliance, but Australian
officials have protested export subsidies the United States places
on wheat, subsidies the Australians say hurt their exports abroad.
   Australian officials who hoped Quayle would say the subsidies
were ending were angered at his public comments. Quayle said at a
news conference on Thursday, ``We do not believe that it (the
subsidy program) is injuring Australia.''
   Senior government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Prime Minister Bob Hawke was exasperated at Quayle's stance in
a private meeting. Hawke said on Thursday that the losses ``are not
figments of our imagination. They are cold, hard and brutally
hurtful economic statistics which have adversely affected our
farmers, our wheat farmers.''
   The country's major national newspaper, The Australian, was more
blunt in an editorial, saying, ``Who do you think you are kidding,
Mr. Quayle? Read our lips, Mr. Quayle. Australians are not happy.''
   The vice president and his wife, Marilyn, flew here from
Melbourne, their second stop on their five-day trip to Australia.
   Taking a cue from President Bush, who sometimes spontaneously
stops his motorcade to mix with the crowds, Quayle jumped out of
his limousine in downtown Melbourne to shake hands outside one of
the city's landmarks, the clocks at the Flinders Street train
station.
   Quayle, trailed by local reporters, also insisted on walking
near the waterfront in Sydney, much to the consternation of his
Secret Service agents. ``I wish he would get in the car,'' one
agent said in an exasperated tone.
   Before he left Melbourne, Quayle laid a wreath at a war memorial
where a brass plaque honors U.S. Marines who fought at Guadalcanal
in World War II.
   He also stopped by the National Tennis Center, home of the
Australian Open, to honor Oz Tennis, a charity that gives poor
children the chance to learn the game. The vice president hit
tennis balls there with former Wimbledon doubles champion Paul
McNamee and 11-year-old Michael Memedev.

   One of history's most notorious naval
revolts, the mutiny on the Bounty, was re-enacted today in the
South Seas by descendants of Capt. William Bligh and his rebellious
first officer, Fletcher Christian.
   ``It was a wonderful moment, the ghosts of Bligh and Christian
were with us today,'' said Capt. Ronald Bligh-Ware, whose
great-great-great-grandfather was set adrift off the Pacific island
nation of Tonga on April 28, 1789.
   ``Today was probably the most jovial mutiny in history,'' the
62-year-old Bligh-Ware added. ``We popped champagne corks and it
was fun.''
   Bligh-Ware's had only to circumnavigate his ship _ a replica of
the Bounty built from British admiralty charts _ in a long boat.
   His famous ancestor, forced from his ship, was joined by 18
loyal crewmen who sailed a 23-foot open boat about 4,200 miles in
47 days to Timor, Indonesia, in what is still regarded as a
remarkable feat.
   Christian sailed the Bounty back to Tahiti and then spent months
searching the South Pacific for a haven, knowing he would be hanged
if caught. The mutineers eventually settled on Pitcairn Island, one
of the world's most remote settlements.
   There they burned the ship. Their descendants moved to Norfolk
Island, off the east coast of Australia, in the 1850s. Some later
returned to Pitcairn and the populations of both islands to this
day are predominantly of mutineer ancestry.
   Ken Rosebery, owner of the replica Bounty, organized the
re-enactment about 2,100 miles east of Australia. He said that six
of the 36 passengers and crew were direct descendants of the
mutineers.
   The passengers paid an average of $4,800 for the month-long
voyage from Sydney to Tahiti and Tonga. They adopted the names of
mutineers for the re-enactment.
   The replica ship, built in New Zealand in 1979, was used in the
1984 movie ``The Bounty,'' starring Australian actor Mel Gibson and
Britain's Anthony Hopkins.
   ``Bligh-Ware, like his father and grandfather, is a qualified
captain in the Australian merchant navy,'' said Rosebery. ``He also
bears a remarkable resemblance to the 18th century Bligh while
Fletcher Christian's great-great-great-grandson, Gerald Christian,
has the rank of lieutenant commander in the Australian Navy. The
sea seems to run in their families' blood.''
   Commemorative stamps that went on sale today in Tonga depict
Bligh, the Bounty, a navigational compass he used and the small
boat on which Bligh and his men were abandoned.
   In London, where Bligh died, the British navy captain's
reputation is being reassessed. Long regarded as the villain of the
mutiny, he now has almost heroic stature.
   ``The old view of Bligh as a bully is largely legend and I'm
afraid that Hollywood, Charles Laughton, Trevor Howard, Clark Gable
and Marlon Brando have a lot to do with it,'' said Baron Terence
Lewin, a retired British Navy admiral.
   The 68-year-old admiral spoke to The Associated Press in London
at the opening of an exhibition marking the 200th anniversary of
the mutiny.

<HEAD>Jail Inmates, Others Arrested For Extortion Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two inmates and three other people tried
to extort $10,000 from the parents of a college student whose
mutilated body later was found in a mass grave in Mexico,
authorities said.
   The Galveston County Jail inmates were arrested Thursday and
accused of using jail telephones to call Mark Kilroy's parents in
nearby Santa Fe, Texas, where they were awaiting word on the
whereabouts of their son, who vanished in Matamoros, Mexico.
   Santa Fe Police Chief Mike Barry said a caller vowed to cut off
the missing student's fingers and mail them to the family if police
arrested or followed people to whom the Kilroys delivered ransom
money.
   The body of the University of Texas junior was found in a
shallow grave near Matamoros, Mexico, on April 11, one week after
the extortion attempt allegedly began. The body had been mutilated
in a human sacrifice ritual by Mexican drug smugglers, police said.
   Police said the inmates and the other three people were not
believed to be involved with the cult, but had heard Kilroy was
missing and were trying to cash in on it. The inmates were being
held on burglary charges at the time of the alleged extortion plot,
officers said.
   ``We were absolutely shocked that people who are in prison for a
good reason are able to call out and terrorize innocent people,''
said Helen Kilroy. ``We were really shocked that people can be
terrorized from inside our jails.''
   The other three people also were arrested, and all five were
charged with attempted robbery and ordered held in lieu of $20,000
bail.
   Kilroy's mother apparently tried to pay the initial $2,000 the
group sought, but the payoff was not made, Barry said.
   Galveston Deputy Gean Leonard said the inmates had telephones in
their cells to be used to contact family members or their
attorneys. The telephones allow the inmate to make collect calls
only, he said.

   About 9,000 people were left homeless in the
southern state of Veracruz after a freak hailstorm destroyed the
roofs of their homes, news reports said.
   The Exclesior news service said Thursday that no major injuries
were reported in the hailstorm, which occurred in 12 towns
surrounding the Pico de Orizaba Volcano, about 150 miles east of
Mexico City.
   It said numerous people suffered minor head injuries from the
falling hailstones. Witnesses reported seeing hailstones the size
of oranges.
   The storm also caused power and telephone outages, as well as
closing some area roads, Excelsior said.said.
   The government news agency Notimex estimated 1,400 homes were
affected, leaving about 9,000 people temporarily without shelter.
   Excelsior quoted Adolfo Lopez Moreno, secretary to the mayor in
Catemaco, as saying the area had not had a hailstorm in more than a
decade. Lopez said the storm damaged crops of mangoes, peanuts,
beans and tobacco.
   The homeless were being put up in public buildings and churches
until repairs could be made to their homes, it added.

   Strong thunderstorms developed over parts of Iowa and Missouri
today, while snow continued to pile up in the Rockies.
   Storms on Thursday produced scattered tornadoes in Iowa and
Nebraska, officials said.
   One twister swooped down within 1,000 yards of Bluffs Run
greyhound race track in Council Bluffs, Iowa, sending track patrons
scrambling for cover, officials said. One man was injured when he
was struck in the head by debris and required stitches, a security
guard said.
   In a separate incident, Jerry Ostendorf, operations chief for
the Iowa Office of Disaster Services, said a woman was injured when
a mobile home was overturned in Corning, a town in southwestern
Iowa.
   A security guard at Bluffs Run said he climbed into a ditch as
the twister passed overhead.
   ``I grabbed a pretty sturdy tree in the ditch and I could feel
the pressure pulling up on me,'' said James Wanner, 23, of Council
Bluffs. ``I felt the hair on my arms standing up. We were pretty
scared.''
   Showers and thunderstorms today were over southeast Nebraska,
northeast Kansas, central Illinois, central Indiana, southern
Wisconsin and southern Minnesota.
   A few showers and thunderstorms were also over south-central
Texas and southeastern Louisiana.
   Omaha, Neb., received an inch and a half of rain in the six
hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT, while Springfield, Ill., had about an
inch and a quarter of rain. Des Moines recorded nearly an inch
during the same period.
   Snow fell across parts of Montana and Wyoming, with up to 14
inches in northeastern Wyoming. Billings, Mont., Casper, Wyo., and
Lander, Wyo., all received 2 inches of snow in the six hours ending
at 2 a.m. EDT.
   On Thursday, thunderstorms produced wind gusts to 66 mph in Des
Moines and to 70 mph in Norwalk, Iowa.
   Hail the size of tennis balls was reported in Ipava, Ill.
   Meantime, a heat wave Thursday produced several record
temperatures for the date in the South and Midwest, including:

<HEAD>Poll Gives President Bush A `C' Grade For First 100 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the White House can be compared to a
schoolhouse, President Bush earned a ``C'' during his first 100
days, according to a poll published today.
   Bush's predecessor, President Reagan, got a ``B'' in a similar
poll the Los Angeles Times conducted after his first 100 days in
office.
   However, the newspaper noted Reagan's popularity was bolstered
by an assassination attempt 70 days after he entered the Oval
Office.
   The poll also found that 47 percent of those interviewed
``approve of the way George Bush is handling his job as
president.'' Eighteen percent said they disapprove, and 35 percent
said they have no opinion.
   The newspaper said that at the same juncture in Reagan's
presidency, 80 percent of those surveyed approved of the former
president's job performance.
   When people were asked, ``What kind of a grade would you give
President Bush?'' the result was a ``C'' average.
   The survey, conducted by Times pollster I.A. Lewis, interviewed
a random sample of 2,160 people nationwide for four days, ending
last Tuesday. The newspaper said the margin of error was 3
percentage points in either direction.
   Sixty-seven percent of those polled have a positive impression
of Bush, 20 percent unfavorable and 13 percent unsure. One hundred
days into Reagan's first term in 1981, 83 percent of those surveyed
said they had an overall positive impression of him.
   The poll found that 52 percent of those surveyed disapproved of
Bush's handling of the Alaskan oil spill, 25 percent voiced
approval and the remainder were unsure.
   On other issues, 34 percent approved of Bush's steps to control
semiautomatic weapons, and 26 percent disapproved; 24 percent
approved of his handling of the savings and loan crisis, and 27
percent disapproved.
   The total added up to more than 100 percent because of multiple
responses.

<HEAD>Chinese Renew Pledge To Halt Aid To Rebels In Cambodia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Chinese official has renewed
pledges to halt military aid to guerrillas in Cambodia after the
total pullout of Vietnamese troops, Vietnam's foreign minister said
today.
   Meanwhile, exiled Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk today rejected proposals for general elections following
the Sept. 30 withdrawal of the estimated 50,000-70,000 Vietnamese
troops from his country as ``illegal and absolutely unacceptable.''
   Sihanouk, in a written statement, said Hanoi's plan to have all
troops leave Cambodia by the end of September was a ``farce,''
because the Vietnamese-backed government of Premier Hun Sen remains
in power.
   Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in late 1978, ousting the
pro-Chinese Khmer Rouge regime that massacred hundreds of thousands
of Cambodians. Sihanouk, toppled from power in a 1970 coup, now
heads a coalition of three resistance groups that includes the
Khmer Rouge.
   Hun Sen's government has reportedly said it will hold general
elections within three months after the Vietnamese withdrawal.
   Sihanouk, who will meet Hun Sen in Jakarta May 2-3, discounted
the validity of any the elections.
   Hun Sen's government is ``nothing but a creation and creature of
Vietnam'' that ``has no right to to organize 'general elections,'''
he said.
   Sihanouk has said the Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia should
be supervised by the United Nations and that Hun Sen's government
should be dissolved prior to a general election, demands the
Cambodian premier has rejected.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said a Chinese vice foreign
minister made the pledge to halt military aid when he received a
copy of Vietnam's April 5 declaration of a total withdrawal. Thach
did not name the vice minister.
   ``They say they will stop once the Vietnamese are all withdrawn,
then they will stop their military aid,'' Thach said, adding he was
confident the pledge would be kept.
   Thach also said Vietnam's Deputy Foreign Minister Dinh Nho Liem
will go to Beijing for a second round of talks to try to resolve
differences over Cambodia. The talks are to be held May 8-10.
   The first round, held in January, was the first high-level
meeting between the two countries in more than nine years.
   Sino-Vietnamese relations have been strained since the 1970s
over border conflicts, Vietnam's ties with the Soviet Union, and
the Cambodian conflict. China is the main supplier of arms to a
guerrilla coalition fighting Vietnamese troops that invaded
Cambodia in late 1978.
   Thach spoke with reporters while attending a symposium in
Bangkok on turning Southeast Asia into a peaceful trading zone once
the conflict over Cambodia is resolved.

   Hours after Exxon showed off its
beach-cleaning effort to reporters, an oil company executive got an
earful when he tried to convince a fishing community that things
were looking better.
   Exxon got good reviews from a state geologist who watched Smith
Island being prepared for pregnant seals. But citizens of Cordova
let Exxon vice president Luyesse LeGrange know they don't see the
same progress.
   Michele O'Leary, one of 300 people at Cordova High School's gym
Thursday night to talk with LeGrange and others coordinating the
spill cleanup, disputed Exxon's claims about the number of skimmers
it operates.
   When Exxon said 19 were working in the sound, an overflight by
pilots for the Cordova United Fishermen Union found only three, she
said. Another occasion Exxon said it had 45 skimmers at work and
the union found only five.
   ``When can we expect to see the situation improve?'' asked
O'Leary, a member of the fishermen's union.
   ``I hardly think that's the case with all the equipment we have
out there,'' LeGrange said. ``I'd be most suprised if we have
equipment not working.''
   After a slow start with officials questioning each other, the
two-hour meeting began to get lively as the audience was allowed to
join the inquiry.
   Dennis Kelso, the state's chief environmentalist, said, ``There
has been a long pattern of claims by Exxon that don't bear out when
people go look at what's happening.''
   Kelso said he wasn't accusing LeGrange of lying, but that
``nobody believes'' the company's recent announcement that the
shoreline cleanup was ahead of schedule _ a mention that drew
laughs from the audience.
   ``I can tell you this is not a technical issue, not a biological
issue or an economic issue,'' Kelso continued. ``It's a moral
issue. Until Exxon steps up to their moral responsibility and stops
trying to shift blame to somebody else we're going to have problems
getting the kind of performance we all expect, whether it's in the
water or on the shore.''
   LeGrange denied there was any shifting of blame.
   ``But perhaps there's some sharing that needs to be
considered,'' he said. ``In the end, the truth will come out in
hearings, in court rooms where people are testifying under oath and
subject to cross examination.''
   National Transportation Safety Board hearings on the accident
and the emergency response have been set for May 16-19 in Anchorage.
   The tone of the town meeting was sharp but polite, a contrast to
the first meeting of Exxon officials and Cordova residents
dependent on fishing in Prince William Sound for their livelihood.
   At the earlier meeting, speakers were interrupted and there was
considerable shouting. The confrontation occurred shortly after the
Exxon Valdez wrecked on Bligh Reef and put more than 10 millions of
oil into the sound.
   The newly arrived USS Juneau sent its first crews to beaches on
Smith Island Thursday, with reporters on hand to watch water hoses
turned on the thick, black goop coating the rocks. Standing on the
beach was difficult.
   A shoreline three football fields long should take about three
days to clean, said Bert Hartley, a field manager for the cleanup.
But a worker struggling to maintain his footing on the beach's
oil-slickened rocks disagreed.
   It takes 10 or 15 minutes of high-pressure spraying to wash the
oil off a rubber work suit, said Harold Jones of Cordova, who
joined the cleanup crew for nearly $17 an hour after his work as a
fishermen was imperiled by the spill.
   ``And they say they're going to have this beach cleaned in three
days,'' Jones said. ``I'd call that extremely optimistic.''

   A woman pleaded guilty to shooting up the
home of the couple who introduced her new husband to another woman.
   Rhonda Nilles, 24 entered the guilty plea to a felony charge of
aggravated burglary on Wednesday, the same day the final divorce
decree was issued to end her marriage to Dan Nilles.
   The couple was married last Dec. 3. Shortly afterward, Lisa and
Terry Townsend introduced Dan Nilles to a friend. On Dec. 18,
Nilles told his wife he was leaving her for the other woman, court
records said.
   Two days later, the Townsends returned home to find their dog
shot dead, blood stains around the room and bullet holes in
Christmas gifts and in a mounted deer head on the wall.
   Rhonda Nilles was found at the scene of a one-vehicle accident
nearby and was taken to a hospital in this western Montana town.
   Her plea, entered in Ravalli County District Court, was part of
a plea bargain calling for no jail time and under which Rhonda
Nilles agreed to pay $2,575 in restitution to the Townsends,
officials said.

   At the Xidan intersection near the city's center,
workers and unemployed youths broke through a line of about 200
police to help students maintain their pro-democracy march to
Tiananmen Square.
   ``We're opening a road for them,'' said one worker, carrying one
of his shoes, which had fallen off during the scuffle. ``The people
outnumber the students now.''
   Just west of the central square, hundreds of workers surrounded
the final line of security forces.
   ``Give way to the students!'' they shouted, their voices
bouncing off the red-brick walls of the Forbidden City.
   As the officers' ranks folded, the crowd broke out cheering.
   Defying threats that they might lose their jobs, thousands of
workers on Thursday took part in the 20-mile student march,
swelling the number of participants to 150,000.
   ``If China's children have the courage to come out, then its
fathers do, too,'' said a middle-aged electrician as he marched
with his colleagues. ``We're all taking sick days.''
   Scores of workers at the Beijing Light Automobile Co. handed
marchers dumplings and drinks. At a construction site nearby, work
stopped temporarily and workers waved from atop a 15-story building.
   Workers packed every corner, sitting atop buildings, billoards
and subway entrances. ``Long live students! Struggle till the
end!'' they chanted as the crowd moved by.
   The spontaneous action was an indication of widespread
opposition to the government. It also bore testimony to student
efforts earlier this week to bring their case to the people.
   ``The government should not stop people from speaking,'' said an
elderly dentist. ``I'm too old to push soldiers, but I can still
walk with them.''
   ``My factory may fire me but I don't care,'' said a foreman at a
bus plant, as he walked near the head of the protest. ``These kids
need help, and I'm here to provide it.''
   Student protests began last week following the April 15 death of
ousted Communist Party leader Hu Yaobang.
   Workers did not start appearing in the throngs until Saturday,
when 150,000 students and their supporters occupied Tiananmen
Square during Hu's funeral, calling for a free press and an end to
corruption in the Communist Party. But they did not start actively
participating until Thursday.
   Since the Saturday protest, bands of student activists on street
corners have given speeches and collected money for their protest.
   Workers said they agreed with student opposition to corruption,
nepotism and special privileges. Many senior officials in state-run
factories engage in corruption, making huge profits while their
employees live on fixed salaries.
   ``I read one of their leaflets and it made sense,'' said a young
driver. ``I know the party leader in my company is corrupt and the
students want a clean government.''
   Some workers said they would keep on supporting the students,
but it was unclear to what extent.
   ``Do you know what this is?'' one worker asked. ``It is China
standing up.''

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Takes Effect In Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven weeks of fierce fighting between
Christian and Moslem forces stopped today under a cease-fire called
by the Arab League.
   But an apparent disagreement over a key provision of the truce
regarding blockades of the country's ports threatened to undermine
the cease-fire.
   The latest round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year civil war
began on March 8 and has killed 273 people and wounded 993,
according to police.
   The 22-member Arab League worked out the cease-fire plan
Thursday during a meeting in Tunisia and promised to dispatch Arab
observers to monitor the truce. Three previous cease-fires
sponsored by the league have collapsed.
   Earlier today, Beirut was shaken by several rocket and artillery
blasts as Christian army units under Gen. Michel Aoun battled with
Syrians and their Druse Moslem militia allies along the Green Line
that slices Beirut into Christian and Moslem sectors. No casualties
were reported, police said.
   Aoun, who heads a three-man Christian cabinet, said he welcomed
the ``lifting of blockades imposed on legal ports besieged by the
Syrian forces.''
   He said in a statement that maritime agencies should ``instruct
their ships to head to legal ports,'' apparently meaning that Aoun
still did not intend to end his blockade of illegal ports runs by
Moslem militias south of Beirut.
   The latest round of fighting began when Auon ordered his forces
to blockade those ports on March 6 in an effort to restore
government authority.
   The Druse Moslems responded by opening fire on the Beirut Port,
which Aoun's forces control. The Syrians then joined in shelling
and besieged Christian east Beirut and a 310-square-mile Christian
enclave to the north.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a mainly Moslem
cabinet that is at odds with Aoun's government, also pledged to
observe the cease-fire.
   In Damascus, Syria, the official news agency SANA said the
government of President Hafez Assad was ``satisified with
resolutions announced by the Arab League on Lebanon.'' Syria
initially sent its 40,000 troops into Lebanon in 1976 on a
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   Aoun for weeks had rejected any settlement that did not include
a timetable for Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon.
   An aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Aoun agreed to
the Arab League cease-fire because it included the Arab observers,
whose presence could curb Syria's influence.
   ``This, of course, is not enough. However, it is a good step in
the march toward stripping Syria of its total control over
Lebanon,'' the spokesman said.
   The Beirut daily newspaper An-Nahar said the main achievement of
the Arab League decision is that Syria ``no longer is the sole
power in Lebanon.''
   The Arab League's final statement did not say how many observers
would be sent to Lebanon.
   Newspapers and Arab League sources have said a special committee
it formed in January proposed dispatching 312 observers under a
Kuwaiti commander. Kuwait heads the committee, which also includes
the foreign ministers of Jordan, Sudan, Tunis, Algeria and the
United Arab Emirates.
   Beirut International Airport, the country's only air transport
facility located on the southern edge of the Moslem sector, has
been closed since March 12, when it became a target of Christian
gunners.
   Aoun said today it could reopen. But a source close to Hoss said
the airport would remain closed until the Hoss cabinet decides to
reopen it.

<HEAD>McGraw-Hill Withdraws From Iran Book Fair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McGraw-Hill Inc. says it will not participate in
a book fair next month in Iran because of the ``unfolding
politicalization'' of the event.
   The company announced its decision Thursday, one day after
another U.S. publisher that had planned to exhibit its books at the
fair, John Wiley &amp; Sons, a major producer of technical and
scientific books, announced it would pull out of the event.
   The two publishers were criticized by the Authors' Guild and by
the publisher of Salman Rushdie. Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, issued his death threat against the British author,
saying Rushdie's novel ``Satanic Verses'' is blasphemous.
   McGraw-Hill Inc. had planned to participate through its company
in England, McGraw-Hill Book Co. (UK) Ltd., but said in a statement
it had directed the subsidiary to ``withdraw completely'' from the
book fair.
   ``The unfolding politicalization of the book fair indicates
participation serves no constructive purpose,'' McGraw-Hill said.
   The biennial fair, scheduled for May 7-19 in Tehran, is
conducted by the Iran Ministry of Islamic Culture and generally
concentrates on scientific, medical and technical books.
   McGraw-Hill said its original decision to show its books in Iran
was based on the belief that ``there should be no sanctions on
knowledge'' and that ``some good would be served by making medical,
scientific and technical publications available to Iranian
students.''
   Neither McGraw-Hill nor Wiley had planned to send anyone to
Tehran.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Ask For Life Sentence for Hamadi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors today demanded a life
sentence for Mohammed Ali Hamadi for his role in the hijacking of a
TWA plane and the slaying of a U.S. sailor.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air
piracy in the June 1985 hijacking. He admitted taking part in the
hijacking but denies killing Navy diver Robert Stethem.
   In closing arguments, chief prosecutor Achim Thiel said although
it could not be proved Hamadi pulled the trigger of the gun that
killed Stethem, ``it was a clear case, at a minimum, of felony
murder.''
   Peter Korneck, the assistant prosecutor in the trial, which
opened July 5, 1988, said: ``It was an attack against the
foundations of civilization.''
   ``There was no excuse for what happened. It cannot be justified
or excused,'' Korneck said, referring to the hijacking, Stethem's
murder and the brutal beatings of passengers.
   ``There was nothing in the evidence presented that would justify
a milder sentence,'' Korneck said.
   Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage 17 days after the jet
was commandeered while on a flight from Athens to Rome.
   A verdict is not expected until the second half of May. Life
imprisonment is the maximum penalty for murder and air piracy in
West Germany.
   Under West German law, an accomplice can be convicted of murder
even if he did not pull the trigger.
   ``It cannot be proved that Hamadi killed Stethem with his own
hands. But he is at a minimum equally guilty,'' Thiel said.
   Hamadi has blamed his fugitive accomplice, Hassan Ezzeddine, for
Stethem's murder. None of the witnesses who testified during the
trial, including dozens of former hostages and crew members of the
hijacked plane, saw the slaying.
   In their closing arguments, the prosecutors referred repeatedly
to the beatings of passengers described by witnesses.
   ``Hamadi beat Robert Stethem and Clinton Suggs (another U.S.
Navy diver) when they were totally defenseless,'' Thiel said.
``They were beaten without reason. He did it out of hate.''
   ``He beat Suggs until the skin on his back popped open,'' the
chief prosecutor said. ``The sadistic beating of Kurt Carlson
(another U.S. passenger) until he was unconscious was verified by
other witnesses. They believed that Carlson was dead.''
   ``We demand life imprisonment for murder and three cases of
grave bodily harm. The murder, the brutal beatings of Stethem,
Suggs and Carlson call for a life sentence,'' Korneck said.
   Both prosecutors described Hamadi as the leader of the
hijacking. Hamadi has denied being the leader.
   The prosecutors also argued that Hamadi should be treated and
sentenced as an adult. According to evidence obtained by the
prosecutors, Hamadi turned 21 the day before the hijacking began on
June 14, 1985.
   Hamadi has claimed that he is one or two years younger but has
not given a precise date of birth. Under West German law, the age
issue could influence the length of sentence.
   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia, and their other two
sons, Kenneth and Patrick, listened closely to the proceedings.
   Hamadi was arrested in January 1988 at Frankfurt's airport when
customs officials found explosives in his luggage.

<HEAD>Judges Challenge Right Of Historians To Reprint Letters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a little-noticed decision, a federal appeals
court challenged the right of historians and biographers to reprint
letters, diaries and other unpublished primary source material
without permission.
   The ruling last week upheld on a technicality Henry Holt &amp; Co.'s
right to print an unflattering book about L. Ron Hubbard, the
founder of the Church of Scientology.
   A Danish corporation related to the church maintained that use
of a Hubbard letter constituted copyright infringement and sought
to bar the book, ``Bare-Faced Messiah'' by Russell Miller.
   The three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in New York ruled unanimously April 19 that the plaintiffs had sued
too late.
   The opinion signed by Judges Roger J. Miner and Frank X.
Altimari read: ``The District Court denied an injunction for
several reasons, one being the existence of special circumstances
in which free speech interests were said to outweigh the interests
of the copyright owner. We are not persuaded, however, that any
First Amendment concerns not accommodated by the Copyright Act are
implicated in that action.
   ``An author's expression of an idea, as distinguished from the
idea itself, is not considered subject to the public's `right to
know.'''
   Floyd Abrams, a lawyer who specializes in First Amendment cases,
said of the decision, ``What they do is reject totally the notion
that the First Amendment has any role to play in deciding whether
to issue an injunction in a copyright case.''
   In a separate opinion, Chief Judge James L. Oakes sided with the
trial judge, Pierre N. Laval, who also denied an injunction in U.S.
District Court in August but said the courts should consider the
free-speech rights of an author as well as the copyright interests
of the plaintiff, especially if the material quoted is essential to
demonstrate the point of a criticism.
   Oakes said his colleagues' opinion ``tends to cast in concrete''
the language Miner used to decide a similar case involving a
biography of author J.D. Salinger.
   In October 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the 2nd
Circuit's decision barring Random House from publishing the
biography by Ian Hamilton unless brief quotations from and
paraphrases of Salinger's letters were deleted.
   The appeals court ruled that the letters, which had been donated
to libraries and were open to scholarly perusal, still belonged to
the writer.

<HEAD>Solidarity Debuts On State Radio</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a mixture of political commentary,
music and snippets of history, Solidarity debuted on state radio
today under an agreement that gives the trade union limited access
to mass media.
   ``We return to the air after long years,'' said one of the three
hosts, all Solidarity activists.
   The taped program began with religious and union songs
interspersed with fragments from historical events, including the
sound of cheers that greeted an April 17 court ruling making
Solidarity legal again after a seven-year ban.
   It also had man-in-the-street interviews about the return of
Solidarity and political commentary by opposition theorist Jacek
Kuron.
   It ended with an appeal by another opposition politician,
Wojciech Lamentowicz, asking people not to boycott June
parliamentary elections in which opposition candidates are to
participate for the first time since 1947.
   ``We will elect in June. Yes, elect,'' he said. ``For the first
time in many years we will elect and not just vote. So the
conclusion that a boycott serves any cause makes no sense at all.''
   Kuron discussed the opposition's program in the election
campaign.
   ``The goal ... is sovereignty of the nation, independence and
improvement of the republic,'' he said.
   He stressed that the opposition's agreement with authorities
that guarantees the Communist Party and its allies a 65 percent
majority in the Sejm, the existing parliament chamber, applied only
to this year's vote.
   ``The next elections should be free,'' he declared.
   The radio show was broadcast at 11 a.m. on Radio One, the main
channel of state radio. Another broadcast was planned Tuesday on
another channel and a third was scheduled for May 12.
   The melody at the opening of the program was composed especially
for Solidarity by well-known composer Wlodzimierz Korcz, an
announcer said.
   Access to the mass media was guaranteed the opposition under the
accord reached April 5 between communist authorities and the
Solidarity-led opposition. The agreement contains political and
social reforms aimed primarily at reviving the country's declining
economy.
   In addition to a half-hour weekly on radio, there is to be a
half-hour weekly television broadcast. Printing of the first
opposition mass-circulation daily newspaper is planned next week.
   All the opposition broadcasts and publications will be subject
to the same state censorship as the government media.
   Four months after martial law was imposed in December 1981 to
crush the union, the Solidarity underground began organizing brief
clandestine radio broadcasts from time to time at various FM
frequencies using hidden transmitters. Sometimes they even would
broadcast on state television during the news. However, the
broadcast range was limited, and officials soon learned how to jam
the transmissions with loud disco music.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Scholastic Aptitude Test Biased Against Girls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sex-biased questions on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test taken by millions of college-bound students are
causing girls to lose admission to selective schools, scholarships
and self-image, a researcher says.
   Phyllis Rosser said Thursday she studied the answers of 100,000
students on the November 1987 SAT. Of the 145 questions, she
pinpointed 23 in which one sex did at least 10 percent better than
the other. Boys did better in all but two, she said.
   ``These questions are tipping the balance. As a result, four
years of high school achievement go down the drain. They're wiped
out by a three-hour test,'' said Rosser, a senior research
associate at the Center for Women Policy Studies. Her study was
financed by a federal grant under the Women's Educational Equity
Act.
   The SAT, administered by the private Educational Testing
Service, is taken annually by 1.5 million students, 52 percent of
them girls. In 1988, average female scores were 13 points lower
than male scores on the verbal section of the test and 43 points
lower on the math section.
   The major purpose of the SAT is to predict first-year college
grades. However, Rosser said studies show that females earn higher
average grades than males in both high school and first-year
college classes.
   Rosser said ETS has a bias-screening process but does not make
its results available to researchers or the public. She said her
study is the first to identify specific questions that create a
gender gap.
   For the verbal section, she said an example of a male-biased
question would be ``Dividends are to stockholders...'' with the
answer being ``as royalties are to writers.'' A question favoring
females would be ``Love is to requite ...,'' with the answer being
``as attack is to retaliate.''
   While the verbal section would be easy to balance, Rosser said,
problems in the math questions that produced a substantial scoring
discrepancy were not as obvious.
   The SAT is ``underpredicting the performance of 780,000 girls
every year,'' she said. ``Why are we letting this happen to girls?''
   Nancy Burton, director of the ETS admissions testing program,
defended the SAT's accuracy as a predictor and said slightly lower
grade point averages for male freshmen were due to tough grading by
math and science professors in courses more likely to be taken by
males.
   In general, she said, ``almost all of these score differences
reflect valid academic differences between men and women taking the
test.''
   Burton said, however, that ETS has recently begun to adjust the
SAT. ``We are throwing out questions that show they're unusually
difficult for men or unusually difficult for women. We also do it
for ethnic groups,'' she said. The first test developed that way
was given last March and results are not yet in, she said.
   Rosser said the consequences of the gender gap include loss of
scholarships to girls _ chief among them National Merit
Scholarships awarded to students who score highest on the
Preliminary SAT (PSAT) in their junior year of high school.
   In addition, she said, the test scores affect women's chances of
admission to 1,500 colleges and universities that use SAT cutoffs
as an admission standard and they limit access to gifted and
talented programs that colleges offer to high school students.

   A woman who was infected with the AIDS
virus through a blood transfusion will not get any damages from the
blood bank that handled it, a jury has ruled.
   The jury found Thursday that the Irwin Memorial Blood Bank was
not negligent in its method of screening donors before the spring
of 1985, when blood banks nationwide began using a test for the HIV
infection.
   Betty Dale, 59, underwent heart bypass surgery in February 1984
and received blood from Irwin Memorial. She was found to have AIDS
two years later.
   The verdict was returned following a three-week trial. It was
the first case tried against Irwin since the San Francisco blood
bank suffered the industry's first-ever loss in an AIDS case last
December.

<HEAD>Church Leaders Urge Compromise on Women Bishops</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Release 10 a.m. EDT, Time Set by Source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A church commission today urged that the world's
70 million Anglicans concentrate on what unites them and avoid
further divisions over the issue of women bishops.
   ``Bishops should take every opportunity to emphasize their
fundamental agreement on matters of faith,'' it said.
   The Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, assigned the
commission to report on how the unity of the 27 self-governing
Anglican churches in 164 countries can be preserved in the face of
the disagreement.
   The dispute deepened in February when U.S. Episcopalians
consecrated Barbara Harris as the first Anglican female bishop, in
their Boston diocese.
   The 18,000-word document, ``Report of the Archbishop of
Canterbury's Commission on Communion and Women in the Episcopate,''
was published simultaneously in London and Larnaca, Cyprus, where
the Anglican primates met to consider that and other issues.
   Pope John Paul II said in a letter to Runcie that the insistence
of some Anglican churches on having women priests and bishops
appeared to block progress toward Catholic-Anglican reconciliation.
The Roman Catholic Church retains an all-male priesthood, and it
split with the Anglican Church in the 16th century Reformation.
   Runcie, spiritual head of the Church of England and world
Anglican leader, will meet with the pope in Rome Sept. 29-Oct. 2,
primarily to discuss unity of their churches, a consultation their
predecessors began in 1966.
   The commission's report dismissed suggestions that a diocese
divided on women bishops might have two bishops catering to
opposing views.
   ``The bishop is an embodiment and agent of unity and continuity
in the church,'' the report said. It stressed that bishops must
take care not to become focal points of dissent in dioceses that
are split on the issue.
   The report recommended that in dioceses with strong views for
and against women priests and bishops, a compromise first worked
out by the U.S. Episcopalians should be adopted.
   The compromise allows any congregation rejecting a woman bishop
to petition for a male ``Episcopal visitor'' bishop to administer
confirmations.
   ``Provision for Episcopal visitors is a way of exercising
pastoral care,'' said the unanimous report written by six ordained
men and an English woman theologian.
   It proposed that women bishops ordaining priests should do so
collegially with a male bishop to meet the objections of church
members who feel they could not recognize the ordinations of a
woman.
   ``That would protect the interests of the person ordained and
the communities in which he or she may minister in the future,''
the report said.
   Runcie set up the commission at the request of the Lambeth
Conference of Anglican bishops in August, when they knew that the
U.S. Episcopalians, who have ordained more than 1,200 women to the
priesthood, were preparing to approve the first woman bishop.
   The conference declared that practical pastoral arrangements
would have to be made in all Anglican churches and dioceses for
those unable to accept women bishops.
   The majority of Anglican churches, including the Church of
England, still rejects women priests.
   A number of Anglican bishops have said they might reluctantly
accept women priests, but could never accept a woman bishop because
it is against belief and tradition. They say it was no accident
that Jesus Christ chose only men as disciples.
   Archbishop of Armagh Robert Eames, who chaired the commission,
said the different views on women bishops were reflected by its
members, who met for nine days of talks in London in November and
in New York in March.
   The other commission members were Bishop Joseph A. Adetiloye,
Primate of All Nigeria; Archbishop Peter F. Carnley of Perth,
Australia; Bishop Mark Dyer of Bethlehem, Pa., Bishop David Hope of
Wakefield, England; the Rev. Dr. E. James Reed, director of the
Toronto School of Theology, Canada, and Dr. Mary Tanner,
theological secretary of the Church of England's board of mission
and unity.

<HEAD>FDA, Drug Company Official Charged In Bribery Scam</HEAD>

   Prosecutors say charges against a Food and Drug
Administration chemist and a drug company executive are the first
in a probe of government and industry officials in a generic
drug-approval scam.
   ``Our investigation has revealed serious flaws in the FDA
approval process for generic drugs, and we will be vigorously
pursuing all evidence of corruption on the part of drug
manufacturers and public officials alike,'' Breckenridge Willcox,
U.S. attorney for Maryland, said Thursday.
   David Brancato, a review chemist with the FDA's Division of
Generic Drugs, was charged with receiving three bribes totaling
$4,300 from officers of two generic drug manufacturers.
   Raj Matkari, vice president of Pharmaceutical Basics Inc., was
charged with giving a $2,000 bribe to Charles Chang, branch chief
of the FDA's Division of Generic Drugs, Willcox said. Matkari has
agreed to plead guilty, said his attorney, Phil Fox.
   Brancato and Chang were bribed for official acts they had
performed or were to perform, court documents filed by Willcox said.
   Chang and the two companies were not charged Thursday and the
U.S. attorney's office did not reveal whether it planned to press
charges against them.
   Willcox said his investigation is expected to generate
additional criminal charges in coming weeks, but FDA officials have
said in statements that any alleged wrongdoing is not widespread.
   The charges were filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Baltimore. Brancato, 38, of Rockville, Md., faces a maximum of six
years in prison and a $750,000 fine. Matkari, of Berthoud, Colo.,
faces a maximum of two years in prison and a $250,000 fine, Willcox
said. Both are cooperating with the government, he said.
   Broncato's attorney, Philip H. Armstrong, declined to comment.
   The FDA's Division of Generic Drugs is responsible for the
review and approval of applications submitted by pharmaceutical
manufacturers seeking to market drugs similar in formula to
brand-name drugs.

<HEAD>Chinese Banned From Chinese Restaurant In South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOKSBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The town council has banned
Chinese people from a Chinese restaurant leased by a Chinese woman
in the city's whites-only park, legislators said today.
   ``I feel like I'm on another planet. It's hard to believe,''
said Issy Kramer, a legislator who voted against the ban. The
council, dominated by the right-wing Conservative Party, passed the
law 10-7 Thursday night.
   Other non-whites had already been prohibited from entering the
resaurant.
   The Conservatives won control of this town east of Johannesburg
last year. They declared Boksburg Lake Park a whites-only area,
except for the black maintenance men who clean it. Other municipal
facilities also were declared off-limits to all but whites.
   The lease for the Golden Lake Restaurant, run by a Chinese
woman, is due to expire May 31, and an item on Thursday's meeting
agenda called for the lease to be granted to another Chinese woman,
S.Y. Yip.
   ``But a paragraph in the agreement says only white people may
enter the restaurant,'' said Kramer. ``I said, `I know you people
are forbidding blacks, coloreds and Indians from entering the park
and lake, but Chinese must be allowed to use the restaurant.'''
   The Conservatives said Mrs. Yip's family may go to the
restaurant if they receive special permission.
   Earlier in the week, Nationalists teamed up with Conservatives
in the nearby town of Benoni to allow blacks to use the reference
section of the municipal library, but not the lending section.
   The issue had come up when two private schools, which have
non-white pupils, applied for permission to use the library.
   Arguing that the whole library should be reserved for whites,
Conservative Party member Willie Koen said white taxpayers had
built the library. ``The more blacks are educated the greater the
influx will be. Whites will find it difficult to read peacefully or
study in the library,'' he said.
   The Conservative Party motion was defeated 13-6. Then the
Conservatives and Nationalists agreed to open the reference section
to non-whites on a vote of 13-5, with one abstention.

<HEAD>Heavy Casualties Reported In New Guerrilla Push For Jalalabad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ Afghan guerrillas claimed today they
captured three army posts and killed more than 100 soldiers in an
attack on a strategic valley near the besieged city of Jalalabad.
   Deen Mohammad, national security minister of the insurgents'
provisional government, said the guerrillas fighting in eastern
Afghanistan overran the Chaprahar valley and pushed to within 2{
miles of Jalalabad airport.
   The attack, which reportedly concentrated on the Afghan army's
81st Regiment, coincided with the 11th anniversary of a bloody
military coup in which the communists seized power in Afghanistan.
   Guerrillas captured three major army posts and 34 small ones,
and destroyed eight tanks and captured five, Deen said in a
statement.
   It gave no details of guerrilla casualties. But one
pro-guerrilla source said the ``heavy fighting left several people
dead on both sides.''
   Deen's statement claimed the insurgents killed as many as 125
government troops since Tuesday and captured 44, including four
officers.
   Afghan government forces have been defending Jalalabad against a
guerrilla offensive since March 6. The city is 40 miles from the
border with Pakistan, where the insurgents have their headquarters.
   The siege is the first major offensive by Moslem guerrillas
since Soviet troops completed their withdrawal on Feb. 15 and ended
their nine year intervention in Afghanistan's civil war.
   Government security forces still hold key cities. But the
insurgents, backed mainly by Pakistan and the United States,
reportedly control more than 90 percent of the ravaged countryside.
   Jalalabad, with a prewar population of 67,000, would give the
guerrillas a strategic foothold to launch an attack on Kabul, 70
miles to the west, and advance their fight to establish an Islamic
republic.

   The juvenile justice system is too soft on the
kind of brutal, senseless crimes committed by a gang of youths who
beat and gang-raped a 28-year-old woman in New York's Central Park
last week, a congressman says.
   ``What we're saying is, If you're going to do big-boy crime,
you're going to do big-boy time,'' Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H., said
at a news conference Thursday in which he called for harsher
penalties for violent juvenile offenders.
   Douglas, a former state Supreme Court justice, was joined by
members of the Republican Research Committee Task Force on Crime to
discuss how the attack April 19 in Central Park highlights the need
for changing the juvenile justice system.
   ``I can tell you that we have a juvenile justice system that is
modeled basically for the middle class,'' Douglas said. ``The
children of folks like us, the children of the middle class who may
get into trouble with shoplifting at a young age, they may throw a
rock through a window, that's where the juvenile justice system
works.
   ``But the system does not work, and it's no deterrent, and it's
no protection and shouldn't be for the kinds of kids who did what
happened in Central Park.''
   But according to news accounts, the youths suspected of
committing the Central Park assault were average city kids.
Teachers called them good students, and one principal said of two
of the boys: ``They come from homes of parents who care, parents
who are as shocked as we are.''
   Four of the suspects lived in a building with a doorman, one
played tuba in the school band, another was described by teachers
and classmates as a talented artist.
   The congressmen said they were unhappy that in many states
youngsters who commit violent crimes such as rape, armed robbery,
murder or attempted murder get little more than a slap on the wrist.
   ``What would happen in my home state of New Mexico if a 13- and
a 14- and a 15-year-old were tried and convicted of kidnapping,
rape, attempted murder and so forth?'' asked Rep. Steven Schiff.
``The answer is absolutely nothing more than reform school, and be
told not to do it again. ... We believe that's based upon an
erroneous assumption that juveniles in all cases are not
responsible for their actions.''
   The task force is hoping by the end of the year to create model
state legislation ``that would cause the most violent of juvenile
offenders to receive the full punishment for their actions if
they're convicted,'' said Schiff, a former district attorney. The
task force would strongly urge states to pass the model
legislation, he said.
   And Douglas said he hoped to pass his own ``carrot and stick''
bill that would withhold federal money for juvenile justice from
states that fail to adopt their model.
   In outlining their ideas for this model legislation, none of the
congressmen raised the possibility of rehabilitating violent
offenders. Asked whether they were not writing off these youths,
Schiff said: ``In the many years that I was a criminal prosecutor
and briefly a defense attorney, I met individuals who I would call
rehabilitated. There was a common thread running through each of
them: they rehabilitated themselves.''
   Rep. Melton D. Hancock, R-Mo., said he sometimes eats breakfast
with the guards from the federal prison in Springfield, Mo.
   ``Several of them have indicated to me that in their judgment,
some people are just plain mean and never should be released back
on society,'' he said. ``There's not anything anybody's going to be
able to do about it.''

   The U.S. dollar moved higher today against the
Japanese yen, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed
at another high.
   The dollar finished the week at 132.49 yen, up 0.44 yen from
Thursday's closing of 132.05 yen. After opening higher at 132.20
yen, the U.S. currency ranged from 132.20 to 132.60 yen during the
day.
   Currency dealers said participants purchased the dollar because
today was the last trading day of the month and because of a
lower-than-expected rise in Tokyo-area consumer prices.
   Consumer prices in the capital area in April were 2.6 percent
higher than a year earlier and 1.4 percent higher than the previous
month, reducing concern over a possible tightening of credit by the
Bank of Japan, said Shinichiro Maruyama of the Industrial Bank of
Japan.
   A 3 percent sales tax went into effect April 1.
   In a news conference today, Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama
said the nation's central bank was worried about price stability
and high oil prices. But the tone of his remarks suggested there
would not be an immediate change in monetary policy, traders said.
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said Thursday the central
bank would act swiftly, if necessary, to sustain price stability.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 65.90 points Thursday, added an additional
212.52 points, or 0.63 percent. That brought the average as the
week closed to a record 33,713.35. The rise followed a 29.88-point
rise in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York overnight.
   ``Shares were bought on a broad front, because of prospects for
a continuing rise in prices,'' said a stock analyst with Daiwa
Securities, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the stock market had already taken into account a
possible 0.5 percentage point rise in the discount rate, the rate
the central bank charges on loans to commercial banks.
   The discount rate has a strong impact on other interest rates.
Higher interest rates tend to make a country's currency more
attractive to investors.

<HEAD>Governor Says Louisiana's Future Rides On Tax Referendum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The future of a state that masks its
poverty with an image of fun, food and crooked politics rides on a
Saturday referendum to give Louisiana the power to change its tax
system, Gov. Buddy Roemer said.
   Roemer's plan shifts the tax base, putting more of a load on
consumers and giving businesses incentives to move into the state
and expand.
   The plan also includes a $1.4 billion program to improve
highways, airports and shipping ports. The transportation portion
would be funded by a gasoline tax increase of 4 cents a gallon.
   If the referendum is defeated, the Legislature would have to cut
more than $600 million from an already tight budget, which Roemer
said is impossible.
   Roemer has touted the plan as a way of creating jobs in a state
that has the nation's highest unemployment rate and ending
Louisiana's dependence on the petroleum industry.
   The governor, who took office 13 months ago with a pledge to
erase what lawmakers have called the state's banana republic image,
won't predict victory.
   ``What frightens me are those who might not look at the plan at
all and be persuaded by something else in Louisiana politics _ old
wars, old wounds, old alliances, business as usual,'' Roemer said
Thursday.
   He said he also feared that opponents he did not name might
spread ``street money,'' a term for vote buying, but he wouldn't
elaborate.
   Two polls conducted over the past week vary in their results.
   One poll showed 48 percent of 812 voters questioned backing the
plan, with 28 percent opposed and 25 percent undecided, with
numbers rounded and a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 points.
A second poll says it's too close to call: Of 750 voters
questioned, 40 percent were for the plan, 38 percent against, and
22 percent undecided, with a 3.6-point margin of error.
   Secretary of State Fox McKeithen said he expects more than 40
percent of the state's 2 million registered voters to cast ballots
on the proposed constitutional amendment giving the Legislature the
power to change the tax system.
   The plan, promoted by businesses and other proponents in a $1
million blitz of television and radio spots, newspaper ads and
mailed circulars, would cost an extra $126 million over the current
tax load.
   Opponents, however, point out that as of July 1, the tax load
increase is $526 million.
   Last summer, the Legislature approved a one-year sales tax
increase of $500 million to avoid government bankruptcy. The
increase, in the form of canceling longtime exemptions on purchases
of food and utilities, will expire July 1.
   Roemer's package keeps about $400 million of that tax on a
permanent basis.
   ``White man speak with forked tongue,'' state Rep. David Duke
said of Roemer. ``He says the plan is (almost) tax neutral without
the gas tax but if it doesn't pass, he says we'll have a $600
million deficit. He can't have it both ways.''
   Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, was elected to the
Legislature in February and became the most vocal of the tax
opponents, who have raised about $60,000 to fight the plan.

   A car driven by a Palestinian blew up today on
a busy shopping street near Jerusalem's police headquarters, and
authorities said the explosion may have been a terrorist attack
that failed.
   The driver was badly burned, but no other injuries were reported.
   In the West Bank, masked attackers shot and killed a Palestinian
in the crowded main square in Nablus. Arab reports said the victim
was accused of collaborating with Israel.
   Eleven other Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with
army troops and Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, according to the Arab reports.
   The army confirmed the incident in Nablus but said it was
investigating the circumstances. Military spokesmen said the army
was checking reports of other injuries.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said police believe the sedan that
burst into flames and blew up was to have been used in a car bomb
attack but went off prematurely. The driver was holding a
detonator, and there were six tins of kerosene and two cooking gas
canisters in the trunk, Sandori said.
   ``We believe it might be a terrorist act that failed because of
the things we found in the car,'' the spokesman said.
   Sandori said the driver, identified only as a Palestinian from
Arab east Jerusalem, has a criminal record for disturbing the
peace. He was reported in serious condition in Hadassah Hospital.
   Officials said the fire that preceded the blast apparently was
caused by cooking gas leaking from the canisters in the trunk, but
Sandori said the fire began in the gas tank.
   A witness said the blast occurred as the driver switched on the
ignition.
   ``Exactly as he switched it the car exploded. It wasn't a loud
explosion. The whole car went up in flames,'' Aryeh Shapira, who
was passing the area on his motorcycle, said on Israel radio.
   In the West Bank, the center of the city of Hebron was declared
a closed military area after clashes between soldiers and
stone-throwing Palestinians, Israel radio said.
   Two Palestinians were wounded when soldiers opened fire on
stone-throwers, the radio said.
   Arab reporters said Jewish settlers in Hebron shot a 14-year-old
boy in the head. The victim, Nader Mohammed Abu Hamdia, was
reported in serious condition at Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital.
   In Nablus, masked attackers shot 38-year-old Kamel Abu Samt in
the head and in the mouth, Arab reports said. He died later in
Ittihad Hospital. The reports said Abu Samt was accused of
collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   A Palestinian was wounded in a clash with soldiers in Nablus,
and seven residents of the Gaza Strip were shot and wounded in
other confrontations with troops, Arab reports said.
   The violence broke out as Arabs in Gaza launched a three-day
commercial strike to protest the death of a 16-year-old killed
Wednesday in Gaza City's Sabra quarter.
   The slain youth was a member of the underground of the Moslem
fundamentalist movement Hamas, or ``Zeal,'' Arab reports said.
   At least 455 Palestinians have been reported killed in the
uprising against Israeli occupation. Eighteeen Israelis have died.
   Israel radio said, meanwhile, that an army investigation of a
deadly raid by troops in an Arab village April 13 showed that
border patrol troops used ``exaggerated'' gunfire to quell Arab
resistance.
   Five Palestinians were shot to death and at least 15 were
wounded in what was one of the worst clashes of the uprising.
   The report on the West Bank village of Nahalin, given to Chief
of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron on Thursday, showed the 25
paramilitary police fired 150 live bullets during the clash, the
radio said.

   A minister has withdrawn a boycott threat
against an insurance company because it has apologized for its role
in sponsoring an award for an artist whose work includes a
depiction of Christ submerged in urine.
   ``I have received a statement from Richard H. Jenrette, chairman
of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States,
apologizing for their part in this matter and it is a genuine
apology,'' the Rev. Donald Wildmon, a United Methodist minister who
heads the Tupelo-based American Family Association, said Thursday.
   Wildmon had threatened earlier this week to urge supporters to
boycott the company for helping fund a $15,000 award to Andres
Serrano in the Awards in the Visual Arts program. The award is
funded by the Equitable Foundation, a division of the insurance
company, the Rockefeller Foundation and the National Endowment for
the arts.
   As winner of the award, the artist selects a work for a national
tour. The 38-year-old New York artist said he had selected his
``Piss Christ'' photograph for the tour because it best reflected
his style. He uses fluids to affect photographic images.
   Wildmon said he had sought apologies from the sponsoring
organizations.
   Jenrette, in a statement confirmed by his office in New York,
said his society was ``deeply upset by the pain that has been
caused by the work by Andres Serrano that was included in the 1988
exhibit of the Awards in the Visual Arts program.
   ``As one of the sponsors of the program last year, Equitable is
very sorry to have had its name associated with an offensive piece
of work,'' Jenrette wrote. ``Please be assured that you have our
sincere apologies and our commitment to take every precaution
against such a situation in the future.''
   Although Wildmon said his association had not heard directly
from the Rockefeller Foundation, the organization's president,
Peter Goldmark, said earlier in New York that he respected ``the
right of any individual to object to a work of art, and the
parallel right of artists to express themselves and of exhibitors
to show works that they deem interesting and meritorious
artistically.''
   Joseph Slye, a spokesman for The National Endowment for the
Arts, said Tuesday that the endowment is ``expressly forbidden in
its authorizing legislation from interfering with the artistic
choices made by its grantees.''
   Serrano, who described himself as religious, said in a telephone
interview from New York on Tuesday that when individuals such as
Wildmon ``attack a work of art to such a great extent, they imbue
it with a far greater power than when they ignore it and, in that,
I'm flattered that they think it deserves such attention.''

   Thirty-two members of Congress are asking El
Salvador's president-elect for action to halt the alleged
persecution of churches by members of his right-wing political
party and by the Salvadoran armed forces.
   The letter Thursday to President-elect Alfredo Cristiani
denounced the ``dramatic escalation of violence committed by
factions from both the right and left'' over the past few weeks.''
   But it singled out for attention recent ``verbal and physical
attacks'' allegedly committed by members of Cristiani's right-wing
ARENA Party against Salvadoran church groups.
   The letter, drafted by Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., and signed by
him and 31 of his House colleagues, said it is believed that
violence against church groups is believed to be connected to their
demands for a negotiated political solution to the war, their
defense of human rights, their demand for an end to war-related aid
to El Salvador and their efforts to relive the suffering of
refugees and displaced people.
   Citing a list of incidents since March 27, the House members
said a teacher in a Baptist school was assassinated, a Lutheran
church worker was abducted, and the offices of church groups broken
into and ransacked by officers of the Treasury police.
   They also complained that ARENA Party members and troops of the
Salvadoran armed forces have threatened the legal aid office of the
Roman Catholic Church in El Salvador for issuing a report ``which
was critical of the rise of death-squad-related violence.''
   ``We urge you to stop the persecution of the churches of El
Salvador and the communities they serve,'' the House members told
Cristiani.
   ``We support action to end human rights violations and we look
for a negotiated solution to the conflict within your country,''
they said.

   Clint Eastwood said he is ``deeply
disappointed and saddened'' by a lawsuit by longtime companion
Sondra Locke who contends the tough-guy actor promised to support
her for life but kicked her out.
   ``It will soon come to light that these accusations are
unfounded and without merit. However, this matter will be dealt
with in an appropriate legal arena,'' Eastwood said Thursday in a
statement.
   Miss Locke, 41, sued Wednesday in Superior Court seeking
unspecified damages, title to two homes and an equal division of
property acquired during the couple's 10-year relationship.
   The lawsuit also claims Eastwood, 58, persuaded Miss Locke, an
actress and director, to undergo two abortions and a sterility
operation because he did not want children.
   Miss Locke, nominated for an Academy Award for the 1968 movie,
``The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,'' co-starred with Eastwood in
``Gauntlet'' ``The Outlaw Josey Wales'' and several other movies.
   Miss Locke claimed they broke up in December and that on April
10, Eastwood removed her clothing, a pet parrot and other items
from a Bel-Air home where she was living alone. Eastwood denied the
claims.

   Jurors in Oliver North's trial resumed
deliberations today, the seventh day they have been considering 12
criminal charges against the former White House aide in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   North made a quick trip to Cincinnati to speak Thursday night to
an invitation-only audience at the Bankers Club and then returned
to Washington to await his fate.
   The former National Security Council staffer spoke about
traditional values and received a standing ovation from his
audience, according to Bankers Club members who heard his speech.
   Steven Doherty, an Ohio State sophomore from Cincinnati, said
North spoke highly of the Bankers Club's next scheduled guest _
former President Reagan _ who will speak to the group in September.
   An anti-Contra group picketed outside the club before the speech.
   ``We don't care whether North sees us or not,'' said Roy Silver,
organizer for the Central American Task Force. ``We're
demonstrating against the Bankers (Club) for giving him $25,000
while there are homeless people in this city sleeping on the
streets.''
   The Bankers Club refused to say how much North was being paid
for his speech.
   ``You're all a bunch of pro-communists'' shouted a well-dressed
businessman at the demonstrators. ``I'm just a pedestrian,'' said
the man as he took two flyers from a demonstrator and tore them
into pieces. He declined to identify himself.
   There was no indication of whether jurors were nearing a
verdict. There have been no notes from the jury since Monday, when
a nurse was sent in to check a panel member's blood pressure.
   The nine women and three men were beginning their second week
isolated from their families. They are shuttled back and forth
between the U.S. courthouse and an area hotel by federal marshals.
   North has not been whiling away the time. He has made several
other speeches since jury selection in his trial began on Jan. 31.
He has been getting $25,000 an appearance through the Washington
Speakers Bureau.
   North, who has had at least three lawyers at the defense table
and at times as many as five, faces legal bills estimated at
$380,000 a month.
   North is accused of lying to Congress to cover up his role in
secretly assisting the Nicaraguan Contras and lying to the attorney
general about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from
the Iran arms sales. He also faces charges that he accepted a
$13,800 home security system and converted $4,300 in travelers
checks from a Contra leader to his own use.
   Meanwhile, North's lawyers and the American Civil Liberties
Union are supporting 10 news organizations in court to seek public
disclosure of a stipulation in the case summarizing intelligence
intercepts.
   The organizations, including The Associated Press, are appealing
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell's ruling that they cannot see
the document. It deals with the CIA-assisted shipment of U.S. Hawk
missiles from Israel to Iran in November 1985.
   North's lawyers used the document to defend him against the
charge that he prepared a false chronology saying that no one in
the U.S. government knew until January 1986 that Hawk missiles were
aboard the flight.

   Many Communist Party officials are unprepared or
unwilling to accept the swift changes wrought by the political
reforms of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the party newspaper
Pravda said today.
   The editorial followed by one day the newspaper's publication of
startling admissions of failure made by party officials at a
meeting of the policy-making Central Committee on Tuesday.
   A senior Western diplomat today said the publication of the
admissions may have been a device used by Gorbachev to force the
officials to more solidly back his program of political
restructuring, known as perestroika.
   Pravda said political activity has rapidly increased over the
past year and democratization is gaining ground.
   ``In many cases, however, party organizations and functionaries
have proved unprepared for the rapid progress in extending
democracy,'' the newspaper said. ``A number of party committees and
local governing councils are lagging behind the times in their
attitudes, styles, methods and interpretation of events.''
   It said many officials were lapsing ``into old thinking,
nostalgia for authoritarian leadership and panicky attempts to
check grassroots initiatives under the pretext of protecting
socialism.''
   Pravda called on all party members, committees and organizations
to follow the line of change initiated by Gorbachev, regardless of
current difficulties facing the economy and society.
   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of
the 20 speakers at the Central Committee meeting may have been
taken by surprise when Gorbachev suggested their comments be
published for the public to read.
   The speeches were sharply critical of the party. For example,
Moscow Mayor Valery T. Saikin said, ``The people feel
uncomfortable, alarmed, have lost their optismism, and various
generations of people, separate social levels and even regions are
quarreling with themselves.''
   As a result, said Saikin, who lost in the recent elections for
the new Congress of People's Deputies, party organizations ``have
lost their vanguard role.''
   Gorbachev, in closing remarks at the meeting Tuesday, agreed
perestroika was going poorly and was worsening shortages of
housing, consumer goods and food. But, the 58-year-old leader said,
people still have faith in the party.
   Gorbachev gained strength to push for more extreme action at
Tuesday's meeting when 74 of the Central Committee's 301 members
retired.
   Because of age, illness or political disgrace, those who stepped
down had lost the top government or party job that entitled them to
membership. The remarks of some of those who retired were published
Thursday.
   Among them was Geidar A. Aliev, the 65-year-old former party
chief in Azerbaijan and a close associate of former President
Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   News reports have accused Aliev of corruption and falsifying
records to show he was a war veteran. But Aliev told the Central
Committee the accusations were untrue and came from people he had
fired in Azerbaijan for wrongdoing.
   Approximately three dozen party officials lost their bids for
seats in the 2,250-seat parliament, or Congress of People's
Deputies.
   Vladimir I. Melnikov, the party chief of the Komi region, told
the committee that many officials are so afraid of the people's
wrath that they are refusing to run in the next round of elections
on May 14.
   ``We are losing the workers,'' he said. The country is ``in a
real crisis'' that Gorbachev is not fully aware of because the
Central Committee staff is ``safeguarding the general secretary
from the severity of the situation.''
   Because of the failures of perestroika, ``the authority of the
party is falling in the eyes of the public,'' said Ivan K.
Polozkov, a party leader in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia.

   Marc Daniels, who directed the first
38 episodes of the ``I Love Lucy'' television series, has died at
age 77.
   Daniels died Sunday of congestive heart failure at St. John's
Medical Center, three days before the death of Lucille Ball, star
of the landmark comedy series. Miss Ball died of a ruptured
abdominal aorta Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles.
   Daniels and cinematographer Karl Freund pioneered the use of
three cameras rather than one in filming ``I Love Lucy,'' one of
the most popular shows in television history. The system,
implemented at the urging of the late Desi Arnaz, then Miss Ball's
husband and co-star, allows a show to be filmed continuously and in
sequence as though it were a stage play.
   As a result, a show can be filmed in front of a live audience.
The three-camera setup is still widely used.
   Daniels worked on such other hit shows as ``Gunsmoke,''
``Bonanza,'' ``Star Trek,'' and ``Hogan's Heroes.''
   He recalled in a 1977 interview that he left ``Lucy'' in 1952
after only one season to take another job that paid more.
   ``Maybe it was a stupid thing to do,'' he said. ``But then we
didn't know we were creating history. ``We were just doing a show.''
   Daniels began his television career in 1948 as director of ``The
Ford Theater,'' which established CBS as a serious dramatic network.
   During his career he was nominated for three Emmys and three
Directors Guild of America awards.
   He is survived by his wife, Emily, who was a camera coordinator
on the ``Lucy'' series, three children, a brother and a sister. A
memorial service is scheduled for Sunday.

   Students chanting ``Yankee go home!''
fought police with firebombs and rocks today after authorities
banned a march to the North Korean border, and striking workers
rioted in two southern cities.
   Several thousand radical students clashed with riot police on at
least five campuses in Seoul after the government banned a march to
Panmunjom border truce site 30 miles north of Seoul for talks with
communist students.
   Twenty student delegates were seized by police as they tried to
get to the border to meet the North Korean student delegates to
discuss taking part in a youth festival in Pyongyang in July and
other ways to reunite the two nations.
   About 6,000 striking workers clashed with riot police in the
southeastern industrial cities of Masan and Changwon, police said.
Strikers in Changwon poured oil on some streets and set them ablaze
and protesters in Masan pelted police with bits of scrap metal.
   It was the fifth day of clashes in Changwon.
   Riot police blocked 4,000 students trying to march out of Seoul
National University. Screaming students armed with metal and wood
clubs attacked riot police with firebombs before troopers stormed
onto the campus firing tear gas.
   Black police vans armed with multiple tear gas launchers fired
hundreds of the bombs as fighting flared around the sprawling
campus. It was surrounded by 3,000 riot police in green combat
fatigues and visored helmets.
   Police officials said people were hurt, but they had no figures.
   Students clashed with riot police on at least four other Seoul
campuses. About 700 students battled troopers with firebombs and
rocks for two hours at Yonsei University.
   Student clashes also erupted in the southern port of Pusan and
radicals seized a government prosecutors' office in Taegu,
according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Student leaders lashed out at South Korean President Roh Tae-woo
and the United States in rallies before the clashes, accusing them
of perpetuating the division of the Korean peninsula. Speakers
called for immediate unification with the communist north.
   ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo, who blocked our vital march to the
north for talks with North Korean students. Let's raise a flag of
anti-facism and anti-Americanism and march to Pyongyang,'' a leader
said at Seoul National University.
   The government banned the march to Panmunjom on grounds it posed
a threat to public safety and the government alone has authority to
deal with the rival north.
   Dissident leaders have said they will go ahead with planned
anti-government protests this weekend, including plans for a major
labor rally in Seoul on Sunday to mark the international May Day
labor holiday. The government has banned all the demonstrations.
   The radical students and allied dissident groups lack popular
support because of their extremism and are not seen as a threat to
the Roh government.
   But government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrest
and a wave of increasingly violent strikes for better pay and
improved working conditions. Top opposition leaders Wednesday
appealed to radical students and workers to halt protests and
warned continued unrest could undermine democratic development in
South Korea.
   Also today, 3,400 police officers offered their resignations to
protest an alleged assault on a police superintendent by an
opposition lawmaker.
   National Police Director Jo Chong-suk said he ordered all the
resignations returned, and government officials said his action
would defuse the situation.
   It arose after legislator Sim Wan-koo reportedly slapped
Superintendent Chung Moon-young in the face during a labor protest
Thursday in Changwon.
   Dissident leaders claim Roh is a front for military rule. Roh
won elections in December 1987 after rival opposition candidates
split the opposition vote.

<HEAD>Takeshita's Governing Party Forces Budget Through Lower House</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Takeshita, Ito comments. No pickup.</HEAD>

   The governing party forced the budget through the
lower house of Parliament today over an opposition boycott, opening
the way for Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to step down as
promised because of a scandal.
   It was the first time since World War II that the governing
Liberal Democratic Party bucked the Japanese tradition of consensus
and used its majority to pass a budget despite a boycott.
   Chairwoman Takako Doi of the Japan Socialist Party, the largest
opposition group, said the move was ``an outrage ... and a serious
challenge to the people.''
   She demanded the government resign and let the opposition govern.
   ``We are determined to continue to fight until we win the
dissolution of the Diet (parliament) and get new elections
called,'' she said.
   The deputy speaker of the lower house, Shinnen Hatagaya, said he
would resign to protest the handling of the budget. An independent
lawmaker, Yukio Aoshima, told reporters he was quitting the upper
house in a similar protest.
   Ms. Doi and the chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party,
Eiichi Nagasue, said the government was trying to cover up the
influence-peddling scandal. Nagasue accused the government of an
``unjustifiable debasement of parliamentary democracy.''
   Opposition politicians blocked the hall outside the house
chamber in an attempt to halt the vote, but guards pushed them
aside to get Speaker Kenzaburo Hara into the 512-seat chamber.
   After the 281-1 vote _ one independent cast a ``no'' ballot _
Takeshita bowed to the chamber, which was nearly a third empty. He
promised on Tuesday that we would resign after the budget has been
enacted.
   ``To be honest, I am feeling relief, but the budget still has to
go through the upper house and I hope it will be passed quickly,''
he told reporters later. Asked if he intends to stay in office
until the passage, Takeshita said, ``You can take it that way.''
   Under the constitution, the $455 billion budget automatically
takes effect May 27 if the less powerful upper house does not act
on it.
   Takeshita said he would step down to take responsibility for a
bribery and stock-profiteering scandal that has deeply shaken the
public's trust in government. The scandal involving Recruit Co., an
information and publishing conglomerate, has dominated Japanese
politics since it surfaced in June.
   Prosecutors say Recruit sold unlisted stocks at bargain prices
to about 160 political and business figures. The buyers profited
handsomely when the stock went public, authorities say.
   The only remaining hurdle to Takeshita's resignation is
selection of a successor.
   Takeshita planned a weeklong visit to Southeast Asian countries
beginning Saturday, and observers believe he will leave office
shortly afterward.
   The apparent top choice of party leaders, former Foreign
Minister Masayoshi Ito, 75, has refused suggestions he take the
job. He said again today the job is too heavy a burden for him
because of his age and poor health.
   Ito is known as ``Mr. Clean'' because of his humble political
style. He suffers from diabetes, and government officials say his
doctor has recommended he work no more than three hours a day.
   Earlier today, Takeshita attended the funeral of Ihei Aoki, his
top aide and fund controller, who committed suicide Wednesday. Aoki
resigned last year after it was disclosed he had purchased
bargain-priced stock from Recruit.
   This week, Takeshita admitted Recruit loaned $384,000 to his
campaign in Aoki's name.

<HEAD>Radiation from Soviet Satellite Reactors Blinding Scientific Instruments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radiation from Soviet nuclear reactors
powering spy satellites has been blinding scientific instruments
aboard a U.S.satellite, according to reports published today.
   The blinding and its source have been known since 1980, but the
U.S. government classified the data as secret until last August,
scientists said in a series of five articles in Science magazine.
   The U.S. Solar Maximum Mission satellite was launched Feb. 14,
1980, to investigate, among other things, naturally occurring gamma
rays in cosmic rays. Its instruments are being blinded, sometimes
eight times a day, by gamma rays from the Soviet satellite
reactors, the scientists said.
   The blinding means that much of the data sought by the U.S.
satellite could not be gathered.
   The Soviet Union has used nuclear reactors aboard more than 30
satellites since the 1960s to provide electricity to power radars
surveying the oceans for movements of U.S. and other warships.
   To save weight, space satellites shield only their own equipment
from the reactor. The earth's atmosphere prevents any radiation
from reaching the ground.
   Much of the radiation in question is gamma rays. These are
photons produced in nuclear fission more powerful by far than light
rays or X-rays.
   Extremely energetic gamma rays also occur naturally in cosmic
rays, through processes that astronomers do not yet understand, and
in solar flares. Supernovae, quasars and neutron stars are thought
to be sources.
   Though reactor-produced gamma rays interfered with the U.S.
satellite instruments, the main radiation affecting the satellite
was electrons and positrons _ positively charged electrons _ from
the reactor. These charged particles can be trapped for several
minutes by the earth's magnetic field, and positrons colliding with
ordinary matter in the astronomy satellite are annihilated to yield
more gamma rays.
   ``The data storage capacity of (the satellite instrument) was
saturated by such (positron-gamma ray) signals an average of eight
times a day for much of 1987 and 1988, and it was effectively
blinded for the rest of each orbit until the data could be
transmitted to the ground,'' wrote Joel R. Primack, a professor at
the Institute for Particle Physics at the University of California
at Santa Cruz, in n overview article.
   A balloon-carried instrument over Australia in April 1988
launched by a team from the University of California at Riverside
was immune from the electron-positron radiation because of its low
altitude, about 22 miles.
   ``The flux we detected from the nearest reactor exceeded by 50
times the flux expected from the strongest celestial sources,''
wrote the Riverside team.
   The team estimated that it could detect such a reactor in an
orbit as high as 1,500 miles.
   Satellites could turn off their instruments when passing through
vulnerable zones, Primack wrote. ``But if many powerful reactors
are in orbit, as contemplated for advanced stages of (Star Wars),
this approach would probably be inadequate to protect gamma-ray
astronomy in low earth orbit,'' he said.
   Most of the Soviet satellites are in orbits only about 160 miles
high, where traces of the atmosphere would make them fall to earth
after a few months. The Soviet craft are boosted to permanent
orbits nearly 900 miles high after a few months use. It was the
failure of this boosting system that led to the crash of the Cosmos
954 satellite in Canada in 1978 and the 1983 crash of the Cosmos
1402 in the South Atlantic in 1983.
   President Carter proposed to ban reactors in space after the
1978 accident, but the Soviet Union refused. Primack suggested that
now was a good time to renew the proposal.

   Students at universities in Beijing vowed today
to continue a class boycott and campus wall posters proclaimed
victory, a day after more than 150,000 students and supporters
marched triumphantly for democracy.
   ``The strike must go on,'' read a new poster at Beijing Normal
University on the fifth day of the boycott.
   ``We must persist until final victory,'' read another at
People's University.
   The government announced Thursday it was willing to talk with
students about their demands for greater freedom. But student
leaders rejected a stipulation that talks be conducted through
official student groups.
   Protesters at most schools rejected the groups as non-democratic
and formed their own unions, which the government says are illegal.
   Student leaders from several schools met today to discuss
strategy.
   ``We talked about the march but didn't come to any decisions,''
one leader at Beijing Normal University said on condition of
anonymity. ``Right now we are savoring this victory. We have made
the Communist Party bend.''
   Wang Dan, a student leader at Beijing University, said they
hoped the talks would be held soon and wanted to meet Premier Li
Peng.
   ``He is the leader of the government, and he should hear all the
views of the citizens,'' he said.
   Newspapers throughout China carried a Xinhua News Agency story
saying only 30,000 students marched Thursday.
   But the 20-mile march through the streets of Beijing drew more
than 150,000 students, workers and city residents calling for a
free press and political reforms. It was communist China's largest
protest in modern times and lasted 15 hours.
   The march occurred after an editorial in the People's Daily
called the student movement a ``chaotic disturbance'' and accused
students of being unpatriotic.
   The unrest began after the death of ousted Communist Party
leader Hu Yaobang on April 15. The party fired him in 1987 for
failing to crack down on pro-democracy demonstrations in late 1986.
   Protesters who led the march Thursday carried a poster saying:
``Uphold the righteous leaders of the party.''
   Significantly, today's Xinhua report did not accuse the students
of wanting the overthrow of the government. Most students say they
only want the leaders to do their job better and respect human
rights.
   Television today showed the first footage of the march. The
report also repeated warnings the protest was illegal and
organizers were breaking the law.
   The People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper,
published an overview of the two weeks of protests, apparently to
pacify students.
   The article denied students had been beaten in Beijing last week
when they staged a sit-in at the gates of the Communist Party
headquarters. An Associated Press reporter saw police hit at least
six students.
   The article also attempted to dispel a rumor that a female
student had been killed. The woman, it said, was hit by a car as
she returned from the protest. Many students believe police killed
her, although it appeared the newspaper's account was correct.
   The country' most liberal newspaper, the Shanghai World Economic
Herald, resumed publication today after the city government fired
its chief editor, Qin Benli, and installed in his place city
propaganda official Liu Ji.
   Today's issue is an altered version of a withheld April 24
edition, which carried six pages honoring Hu.
   ``The items the government said were likely to cause
disturbances have been taken out,'' one of the paper's editors said.
   During Thursday's march, tens of thousands of Beijing residents
escorted students on bicycles and on foot, and tried to shield them
from soldiers and police.
   ``We're opening a road for them,'' said one worker, after he
helped push through a line of officers.
   Police had issued harsh warnings against marches, but the
security forces were unarmed and they gave up after pushing matches
failed to stop advancing demonstrators.
   Students say they plan another march May 4, the 70th anniversary
of China's first student movement for democracy. The movement grew
out of students' opposition to Japan's territorial advances in
China after World War I but developed into a quest for broader
political goals, including democracy.

   Visiting Vice President Dan Quayle has
angered the government with his insistence that U.S. wheat
subsidies are not hurting Australia, prompting one newspaper today
to say: ``Read our lips Mr. Quayle, Australians are not happy.''
   Senior government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Prime Minister Bob Hawke was exasperated at Quayle's
intransigence and that he became agitated and tense during their
talks on Wednesday.
   Quayle, at a news conference Thursday, bluntly refused to accept
Hawke's assertion that Australia had a declining share of the world
wheat market because of U.S. subsidies, known as the Export
Enhancement Program.
   ``It is still my belief that U.S. trade policy isn't hurting
Australia,'' Quayle said, adding that the subsidies were directed
against the European Community and ``not targeted at Australia.''
   But Hawke told reporters later: ``If a bullet hits you in the
head, it hurts just as much if it was not aimed at you as if it was
aimed.''
   Quayle argued that U.S. trade subsidies were designed to counter
EC subsidies while Hawke said they affected Australia's wheat sales
to China, the Soviet Union, Egypt, Iraq, Mexico, Sri Lanka and
Yemen. He said Australia had suffered a ``very significant'' loss
of exports to those countries.
   He cited a 91 percent loss in exports to the Soviet Union and a
21 percent loss in sales to China. Overall, Australian wheat sales
have fallen from an annual high of 18.6 million tons to 12.5
million tons since the U.S. subsidy program took effect.
   ``Now these sorts of things are not figments of our imagination.
They are cold, hard and brutally hurtful economic statistics which
have adversely affected our farmers, our wheat farmers,'' Hawke
said.
   Trade Negotiations Minister Michael Duffy was more direct,
saying: ``If Mr. Quayle, after a fulsome briefing by the prime
minister, can't grasp the situation (then) there is little hope for
him.''
   The country's main nationally circulated newspaper, The
Australian, said in its editorial today: ``Who do you think you are
kidding, Mr. Quayle? Read our lips, Mr. Quayle. Australians are not
happy.''
   Quayle arrived Wednesday on the first leg of a four-nation tour
of the Pacific and the Far East. He is visiting Australia through
Sunday to attend celebrations marking the 47th anniversary of the
Battle of the Coral Sea.
   Officials said trade was the ``single most important'' issue
that Australia had to raise with the vice president. Hawke and
Quayle met for 90 minutes on Wednesday.
   Hawke is to visit the United States in June and the sources said
he would raise trade issues in his talks with President Bush.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party has restored membership to
dissident historian Roy A. Medvedev, whose writings about the
personality cult of dictator Josef Stalin prompted his expulsion in
1969, Tass said today.
   Medvedev asked that the party's Central Committee Control
Committee restore him as a member, and the request was approved,
the official news agency said. It did not say when this occurred.
   In a telephone interview, the 63-year-old writer said he reacted
``positively'' to the news. Asked if his restoration was a result
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, he said: ``I didn't
change my views. A turnabout occurred in the party, the Central
Committee. They stopped discriminating against me. I have been
published here.''
   He added that he never considered asking to be restored as a
party member during the rule of President Leonid I. Brezhnev
because, ``That was another epoch.'' Brezhnev died in 1982.
   Medvedev said party officials asked him several months ago if he
wanted to become a member again. ``They asked me how I would react,
and I said I would not object.''
   Like many Soviets who had fallen out of official favor, Medvedev
has been restored gradually to good graces. He has appeared at
several officially sponsored news conference and was elected April
9 as a deputy to the new Soviet parliament, the Congress of
People's Deputies.
   Tass said it was Medvedev's book ``Let History Judge,'' about
Stalin's crimes, that prompted his expulsion from the party but
that the control committee determined that action was ``unfounded''
and restored his membership.
   ``Let History Judge,'' which Medvedev started writing in 1962,
was published first abroad, in the United States in 1971. It didn't
appear in the Soviet Union until this year, when the literary
journal Znamya published the first part of the book in January.
   The entire book, an indictment of Stalin's dictatorial rule, is
scheduled to be put out by the Soviet Union's Progress Publishers.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness, it is no longer considered dissent to condemn Stalin or
report his crimes. In fact, the Soviet press is full of articles
about Stalin's personality cult.
   Medvedev has estimated that 40 million Soviets were either
killed, arrested or otherwise repressed under Stalin, and his
figure _ along with his remarks about Stalin _ has appeared in the
Soviet press.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Leaving Namibia, U.N. Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. official said today that large
numbers of guerrillas have left Namibia and returned to Angola
after clashes with South African-led troops that jeopardized a plan
for the territory's independence.
   Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the U.N. monitoring
force in Namibia, told reporters that ``substantial numbers'' of
guerrillas had left northern Namibia since midday Wednesday. He
gave no figures.
   South Africa, which has agreed to end its 74-year rule over
Namibia, claimed that about 1,600 guerrillas of the South-West
Africa People's Organization crossed into the territory from Angola
beginning April 1.
   The resulting clashes with South African-led security forces
resulted in the deaths of 305 guerrillas and 27 members of the
security force, according to South African officials.
   Under a regional peace plan that provides for Namibia's
independence, the guerrillas were supposed to have remained at
their bases in Angola until mid-May, when they were to return
unarmed.
   Guerrilla leaders have denied violating the agreement and said
some of their forces already were in Namibia.
   To encourage the guerrillas' withdrawal, South Africa has
confined its forces in northern Namibia to their bases for a
60-hour period that began Wednesday evening and is to end at
daybreak Saturday.
   South African officials have made clear they want a full
guerrilla withdrawal by the end of the period, although they have
not disclosed what steps they would take if they believe guerrillas
remain in Namibia.
   Guerrilla leaders, in a statement issued Thursday, said 1,337
guerrillas had ``redeployed'' from Namibia to Angola. The statement
did not specify the period during which this withdrawal occurred,
nor did it say how many guerrillas remained in Namibia.
   If both SWAPO's figures and South Africa's estimate about the
size of the incursion are accurate, there would be few, if any,
guerrillas, still in the territory.
   SWAPO said its guerrillas ``have been running the gantlet of
South Africa troops' ambushes ... as well as a blockade along the
Namibia-Angola border where South Africa has deployed a division of
its troops to hunt down and kill them.'' The statement said all
guerrillas in Namibia would soon move to Angola as long as security
forces ``do not impede their way.''
   The independence plan is part of an agreement that also provides
for withdrawal of South African and Cuban forces from Angola. U.S.,
Soviet, Angolan, Cuban and South African delegations met Thursday
and today in Cape Town, South Africa, to discuss the status of the
accord.
   In Cape Town, roving Soviet Ambassador Vyacheslav Ustinov
predicted today that the regional peace process would be back to
normal within a month.
   Ustinov, making the first official Soviet visit to South Africa
in 33 years, said: ``I believe that we can make a step in the riht
direction and at least we have succeeded in clarifying a number of
very delicate points and overcome some difficulties, but still a
lot is left.''

   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher today urged NATO allies to seek a reduction in short-range
nuclear missiles, despite strident U.S. and British opposition.
   For the second day, the nation's leaders appeared on a
nationally televised parliamentary session to outline their
position, which has strained the alliance. Italy, Belgium, Denmark
and Norway have sided with Bonn in the growing rift. Most of NATO's
short-range missiles are based in West Germany.
   A government spokesman, Hans Klein, said Dutch Premier Ruud
Lubbers will visit Bonn on Wednesday for talks with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl in an apparent bid to resolve the dispute before a NATO
summit next month.
   The Dutch government has expressed support for the U.S. and
British position and has offered to mediate in the dispute.
   ``The West has no reason to be timid or to be concerned,''
Genscher said in his address. Rather, Genscher said, Western
nations should have the confidence to pursue a course that would
include short-range missiles among the various arms already under
discussion among the superpowers.
   ``We must courageously and decisively make use of the new
openness the Soviet Union is showing,'' said Genscher, a member of
the detente-oriented, centrist Free Democratic Party. ``We must
close that hole in the disarmament chain.''
   Speaking of the West German demand for negotiations aimed at
reducing the number of short-range missiles, Genscher said: ``We
can see that we are finding more and more understanding for this
position within the whole alliance.''
   Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg spoke after Genscher and
also emphasized that West Germany remains bound to NATO.
   Stoltenberg said it was ``totally unfounded'' to say that Kohl's
government could accept a loosening of ties between Bonn and its
Western allies.
   Kohl on Thursday made a speech before parliament in which he
reaffirmed his call for talks with Moscow over the short-range
missiles.
   Such talks are strongly opposed by the United States and
Britain, which fear the negotiations could lead to the removal of
short-range weapons and leave Western Europe dangerously exposed to
Warsaw Pact's superior conventional forces.
   Public opinion polls indicate a large majority of West Germans
are opposed to the modernization of the weapons.
   The issue is causing a division among NATO allies before the May
29-30 summit in Brussels, where the Western alliance hopes to reach
a common position on the missiles.
   Kohl is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
of Britain on Sunday, when the two are expected to discuss the
issue. Thatcher has strongly criticized Kohl's proposal for talks
with the Warsaw Pact.
   The United States has launched a diplomatic offensive against
Kohl's proposal, instructing its ambassadors in NATO countries to
present arguments against starting up negotiations on short-range
weapons.
   Kohl's government has been losing support among voters and the
call for talks is designed to improve its standing before next
year's federal elections.
   Kohl also has called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
to delay a decision on replacing the aging short-range Lance
nuclear missiles until after federal elections next year.
   Recent polls indicate that three-quarters of the West German
population favors eliminating nuclear weapons in Europe.

   The military shot and
critically wounded two people today who drove a stolen car through
a security checkpoint, knocking down a soldier, police said.
   The two males, aged 17 and 20, were in critical condition, and
the soldier suffered minor injuries, said a spokesman for the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, the police force for this British province.
   An undetermined number of other people in the car were believed
to have escaped, said the spokesman, speaking anonymously in
keeping with British custom.
   He said in a statement that the incident occurred just after 1
a.m. in West Belfast ``when a stolen car in which the men were
traveling drove through a joint police-army vehicle checkpoint.''
   The car ``mounted the footpath, knocking down a soldier,
slightly injuring him, before being fired on by the military.''
   The spokesman refused to comment on the motive or identity of
the men, or other details.
   Northern Ireland has been plagued by political and sectarian
violence since August 1969 and more than 2,700 people have been
killed.

   A bitter 18-month effort by the United
Auto Workers to organize the Mack Trucks Inc. assembly plant ended
with 53 percent of the employees voting to accept union
representation.
   Mack Trucks said it would contest Thursday's election, which the
UAW won with 453 votes to 398 for the company. An employee group,
which offered to represent workers, received two votes.
   ``It is totally on hold until it is settled,'' company
spokeswoman Deb Woolley said. ``Mack is not finished fighting this
battle. We are looking at the unlawful practices of the UAW and
challenged ballots.''
   The UAW urged Mack Trucks president and chief executive officer
John B. Curcio to accept the election results.
   ``The present opportunity to change direction should not be
ignored,'' the UAW said in a letter to Curcio. ``The alternative is
further unnecessary damage to the UAW-Mack relationship.''
   Observers predicted the outcome of the election could affect the
way business is conducted in South Carolina, which historically has
ranked among the least unionized states.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell moved quickly to assure business owners
and workers that ``right-to-work'' labor laws will not change in
South Carolina.
   ``Those who desire to join a union are free to do so. Those who
do not desire to join a union are equally free not to do so,''
Campbell said in a statement.
   UAW organizer Robert Miller said employees who do not join the
union will be treated the same as those who do.
   ``In a right-to-work state, we have a right to defend the
people,'' he said. ``They have the right to join the union.''
   ``We worked hard and we prayed,'' Bill Casstevens, international
secretary and treasurer of the UAW, told employees at a victory
celebration Thursday night over the vote at the 1{-year-old plant.
``We're bringing in democracy into this plant and South Carolina.''
   David Mann, a 44-year-old union organizer who has worked for
Mack Trucks for 17 years, said he was ``ecstatic, but not
surprised'' at the election results.
   And Leonard Drabick, a worker in the plant, said he does not
foresee any problems with having the union.
   ``We're still a team. We all stick together. We have one goal
and that is to build trucks,'' Drabick said. ``I'm happy, I'm glad
we got it.''
   Chick Harrocks, a unit manager for Mack Trucks, said he was
disappointed with the election results. ``The employees don't
realize what they got into,'' he said.
   The UAW, which represents 1,800 Mack employees in Maryland,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey, began its drive in 1987 to represent
employees at the Winnsboro plant. The plant opened after Mack
closed its main assembly plant in Allentown, Pa., in 1986.
   Under an agreement between the company and the UAW, nearly 300
employees were transferred to the South Carolina plant. Those
employees each have received $100 weekly from the union to defray
moving expenses and lower wages.
   Employees at the Winnsboro plant will earn $10 per hour by the
end of the summer. Workers at the other three union-represented
Mack facilities make about $14.50 an hour.

<HEAD>Reports: Japan May Compromise On Jet Fighter Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government indicated today it may soften its
stand on a controversial plan to jointly develop its next fighter
jet with the United States, news reports said.
   The Defense Agency has decided to retract its demand that more
than 50 percent of engine production work be given to Japan and
that Japan receive all computer software for flight control of the
U.S. F-16, which is the basis for the new FSX jet, Asahi Shimbun
newspaper reported.
   The Defense Agency chief, Kichiro Tazawa, told reporters today
he hopes to reach agreement with the United States before Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita leaves office. Takeshita's announcement
Tuesday that he will resign soon because of a stock and bribery
scandal brought new uncertainty to already troubled plans for the
FSX, U.S. officials said.
   The Asahi Shimbun newspaper said the director of the Defense
Agency's equipment bureau returned Thursday from talks in
Washington, and his agency consulted today with the Foreign
Ministry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the
prime minister's office to work out a unified policy.
   The FSX project has been criticized by some U.S. congressmen who
charge it is a giveaway of U.S. technology that Japanese companies
could use to compete with the U.S. aviation industry.
   Supporters say the project is a way to add fighters to Japan's
inventory in strategic northeast Asia at Tokyo's expense. It also
would provide jobs for the United States, and give Washington
access to sophisticated radar technology developed by Japan, they
say.
   The Bush administration says it wants clarification of a joint
production agreement reached last year.
   Japan reportedly demanded 50 percent of engine production work
in exchange for giving the United States a 40 percent share of the
production work for the entire aircraft.
   The United States reportedly wants assurances any new technology
developed from the project will be available to the United States,
along with protection for U.S.-developed computer codes that help
fly and control the plane.

<HEAD>TWA Jumbo Jet Lost Part of Wing Slat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A TWA Boeing 747 flying from Los Angeles to London
with more than 200 people on board lost part of a wing slat as it
prepared to land at Heathrow Airport, the airline said today.
   The Department of Transport said officers from the Air Accident
Investigation Bureau have launched an inquiry into the April 20
incident, which a TWA spokesman called a ``minor accident.''
   Aviation experts said the loss of a slat may affect low speed
handling and might mean an aircraft having to land at a faster
speed.
   The leading edge slats are six feet long and positioned along
the front of each wing to increase lift. They are operated
hydraulically to change the air flow over the wing and allow the
aircraft to land at a slower speed.
   A TWA spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said a two-foot piece
of the slat between the fuselage and the No. 3 engine on the right
wing fell off after a bolt sheared. The shearing forced up the
flap, breaking off a section of it, the spokesman said.
   However, he said the damage did not cause any problems with the
handling of the aircraft and denied there had been any emergency.
   ``It did not affect the aerodynamics of the aircraft and the
plane made a perfectly safe landing. The pilot would probably not
have been aware that anything was wrong until he had landed ... it
was a perfectly routine landing,'' he said.
   The spokesman said the piece that fell off would have weighed
about four pounds. He said authorities were notified when the piece
was discovered missing. It has not been found, he said.
   ``It is impossible to say exactly where it was lost because the
crew felt no bump or anything like that. It would have been when
the aircraft was on approach because the slats are only used when
the plane is coming in to land,'' he said.
   The aircraft was taken to the British Airways maintenance base
for repairs.
   The TWA spokesman said that he did not know the age of the
aircraft or the exact number of passengers on Flight 760.

   Pope John Paul II arrived in
this island nation today where a ``papal truce'' was delcared to
silence anti-government protests that have claimed six lives.
   The pope knelt and kissed the ground after being greeted by
President Didier Ratsiraka. The Archibishop of Madagascar, Victor
Razafimahatratra, joined the president in welcoming the pope.
   The pope and Ratsiraka were to meet privately at the
presidential palace.
   Madagascar is the first stop on John Paul's fifth African tour.
The nine-day trip also will take him to the French Indian Ocean
island of Reunion, and to Zambia and Malawi. It is the 41st foreign
pilgrimage of John Paul's 10{- year papacy.
   In all, the pope will deliver 36 speeches and travel 13,500
miles during his trip. He is scheduled to return to Rome on May 6.
   Africa is the continent where Roman Catholicism is experiencing
its fastest growth. The Vatican counts 75 million followers in
Africa, about 13 percent of the population, and projects the figure
will surpass 100 million by the year 2000.
   Africa also is plagued by social and economic problems, and
Vatican officials said the pope is expected to address such issues
as AIDS, human rights and apartheid in South Africa.
   The pope's arrival in Madagascar, a huge island off Africa's
southeast coast, comes on the heels of a series of violent protests
against the government of President Didier Ratsiraka. At least six
people have been killed and 74 wounded in street battles since last
week.
   The demonstrations were organized by opposition leaders who
charged that last month's presidential election was rigged.
Ratsiraka, who took power in 1975, was re-elected for a third,
seven-year term.
   The government said Ratsiraka received about 63 percent of the
vote. A commission set up by a federation of church groups,
including the Roman Catholic Church, said there were many voting
irregularities.
   An alliance of opposition leaders announced Tuesday it would
suspend demonstrations during the pope's visit, saying it
recognized the work of John Paul and the church ``in favor of
democracy and the defense of the rights of man.''
   The opposition leaders said they would renew strikes and
demonstrations after May 1 to press their demands for formation of
a transitional government to hold new elections.
   About 22 percent of Madagsacar's 11 million people are Catholic,
and the church has often spoken out against Ratsiraka's government.
Vatican officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
pope was expected to emphasize the need for respect of human rights
in Madagascar.
   With the country in a deep economic crisis, Ratsiraka has
abandoned some of his socialist policies and turned to Western
governments and international agencies for help. The island's
exotic plant and wildlife also is endangered by mass destruction of
its forests.
   Over the next three days in Madagascar, the pope is to celebrate
Mass in Antisaranana on the northern tip of the island and
Fianarantsoa in the south.
   In Reunion, a French overseas territory, the pope will meet with
French Prime Minister Michel Rocard and beatify a 19th century
Catholic school teacher who helped abolish slavery on the island.
   In a papal first, John Paul will fly on the Concorde, but the
Air France jetliner that will take him to Zambia will not travel at
supersonic speed because of the shortness of the trip.
   In Zambia, headquarters of the African National Congress, the
pope is expected to speak about apartheid in South Africa, the
system of racial segregation which the Vatican recently denounced
as the most systematic form of racism in the world.
   In Malawi, the pope may raise the issue of AIDS, which has
afflicted some 20 percent of the male population, the Vatican
officials said.

   A man who kept hospital workers at bay with a gun
while tearfully removing his comatose son from life support systems
and letting him die dramatized an ethical ``issue waiting to
happen,'' a law professor says.
   Rudy Linares, 23, is charged with first-degree murder and on
Thursday was ordered to undergo a psychiatric examination by a
judge who called his case ``an extraordinary situation surrounded
by extraordinary circumstances.''
   ``I want to know if he is any danger to himself or anyone
else,'' said Cook County Judge Robert Bastone, before setting
another hearing for May 18.
   Linares, free on $75,000 personal recognizance bond, refused to
talk to reporters.
   Defense lawyer Richard Scholz said Linares, who told police, ``I
did it because I love my son,'' will plead innocent.
   Scholz met briefly with prosecutors today in the chambers of
Chief Criminal Court Judge Thomas Fitzgerald and worked out an
agreement to delay until May 3 the appearance dates for those
subpoenaed, said Lisa Howard, spokeswoman for Cook County State's
Attorney Cecil Partee.
   Ms. Howard would not comment further because of the
confidentiality surrounding grand jury proceedings. But a
law-enforcement source with knowledge of the case said Linares'
wife and several other family members had received subpoenas to
appear before the grand jury, possibly as early as today.
   Partee on Thursday confirmed his intention to prosecute Linares,
but suggested there could be ``a compassionate kind of justice.''
   Partee said he could understand the emotions that a parent feels
at seeing the suffering of an incurably ill child.
   ``But we must be reasonable and say, I think, that under no
circumstances does any person have the right to take the life of
another,'' he said during the Thursday taping of a radio show to be
aired Sunday.
   Richard Epstein, a University of Chicago law professor and
fellow at the school's Center for Medical Ethics, said that
charging Linares with murder was wrong and called the case an
``issue waiting to happen.''
   ``Doctors have an exaggerated sense of the sacred nature of
life,'' Epstein said. ``It seems to me he should have been able to
write a letter to the hospital saying, `Please turn off the
respirator. Very truly yours.'''
   Other ethicists also expressed sympathy for the father of two
other children, who along with his wife had asked months ago for
life support to be withdrawn from their 16-month old son, Samuel.
The parents had been refused.
   The boy had been unconscious and not expected to recover since
August, when he swallowed a balloon at a birthday party, said his
physician, Dr. Gilbert Goldman, director of pediatric intensive
care at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, where
Wednesday's incident occurred.
   Goldman said, ``I was personally and professionally
sympathetic'' with the Linares' request to withdraw life support,
but ``I didn't believe there was a legal option to allow me to act
on the basis of their request.''
   Max Brown, legal counsel for the hospital, said that because of
Illinois' child-abuse laws, the only way the institution could have
complied would have been if Samuel had been determined totally
brain-dead or his heart and lungs had stopped functioning.
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at
the University of Minnesota, said, ``I have sympathy for this
father, because it seems to me he felt he had no choice but to act
on what he felt was best for this child at the point of a gun.
   ``I still think he should be prosecuted. I don't think you can
use weapons to direct medical treatment,'' Caplan said in a
telephone interview from Minneapolis.
   ``But I have sympathy because I think society has not made it
possible for parents to be heard about when medical treatment
should be stopped _ when it is futile _ for very young children,''
Caplan said.
   Police said Linares entered the hospital intensive care unit at
about 1 a.m. Wednesday and unhooked the respirator of his son while
holding hospital workers off with a .357-caliber Magnum handgun.
   Linares, a house painter in Cicero, surrendered the gun as soon
as he was sure the boy was dead, authorities said. His wife,
Tamara, was out of the room at the time.
   Authorities said Linares also disconnected the respirator in
December, but it was quickly replaced and he was not charged
because the hospital did not call police.

   An Iraqi soldier shot down an Egyptian
jet fighter by mistake as it prepared to land in Baghdad for an air
show, and there were several casualties as the plane crashed in
pieces, Arab diplomats said today.
   The diplomats, speaking by telephone from Baghdad, the Iraqi
capital, said the incident occurred April 20.
   The plane, an Egyptian-built version of the Alpha fighter-bomber
produced by France and West Germany, apparently was hit by a
Soviet-designed, shoulder-fired SAM-7 missile.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a man on
the ground was killed when the plane fell to the ground, hurling
debris over a wide area. They could not provide details on the
other casualties.
   Egypt's government-run Middle East News Agency said the two
pilots parachuted to safety.
   The diplomats refused to say where exactly the plane crashed.
   There was no imediate comment from the Iraqi or Egyptian
governments. The diplomats suggested the two agreed to keep the
incident under wraps to avoid disrupting Iraq's first International
Defense Fair, inaugurated today.
   Egypt is one of 28 countries participating in the five-day
exhibition, which includes an air show on Saturday.
   The Egyptian plane was to participate in the show, but word of
the invitation had not reached the soldier who downed the jet, The
Washington Post reported today. It cited secret intelligence
reports making the rounds of U.S. government offices.
   Egypt, which was Iraq's main backer in the war with Iran, has
purchased Alpha kits from France and assembles the fighter-bomber
in a plant south of Cairo. The jet has a top speed of 600 mph.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he ``learned a lot''
from his just-completed six-state tour, designed to enhance his
activist image 100 days into his tenure, and took a slap at
unflattering reporting of the trip.
   ``In terms of problem-solving, Washington ... does not
automatically know best,'' Bush told a gathering of the
conservative American Legislative Exchange Council, a
business-oriented group of state legislators.
   Apparently referring to news accounts that described his trip as
themeless, disoriented and jumbled, Bush said:
   ``It's a very important thing for a president to get outside the
White House and move around this country. Some of the friends that
we were traveling with didn't seem to understand that. But I can
tell you that I learned a lot from it. And it was a very good thing
to do and I'm going to keep doing it.''
   The trip was timed to project Bush as an active problem-solver
just as the media assess his first 100 days of his presidency, a
White House aide said Thursday.
   Although Bush has said he is indifferent to the milestone,
``he's making these appearances even before some of these 100-day
stories are getting out,'' said the official. He discussed the
strategy on grounds of anonymity.
   Other White House aides called the trip a success, despite an
aura of confusion caused by scheduling foul-ups and unfocused
presidential speeches.
   ``Sometimes just the idea of getting out of ... Washington is
part of the president's responsibility and role,'' chief of staff
John Sununu said Thursday. ``He really feels it's important for him
to go out and let the folks see him. The president gets a lot out
of it.''
   Sununu conceded that Bush's speeches on several occasions
garnered little coverage on the heavily watched national television
evening news shows. But he said ``you don't always focus just on
trying to get 15 seconds or 30 seconds on the national news. The
regional aspect is very critical.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater denied that Bush's
trip lacked any overriding theme the nation could focus on, saying
that ``the theme is building a better America.''
   Bush began the trip Monday by attending a memorial service in
Norfolk, Va., for the 47 victims of the USS Iowa explosion. this
was added to an already-heavy schedule Monday that had Bush
declaring himself off to ``a good start'' in a speech to Associated
Press newspaper publishers in Chicago.
   The trip took Bush to Illinois, North Dakota, California, Texas
and Florida.
   ``He wanted to get to California to talk about some of the major
issues,'' such as research and development for high technology and
a reduction in the capital gains tax. But Bush dropped plans to
talk about offshore oil drilling because of the Valdez oil spill,
aides said privately.
   Sununu said Bush had been especially determined to hit hard on
the administration's campaign to attack drug abuse.
   ``Most Americans feel it's a critical issue,'' the chief of
staff said, ``and he wants to make sure he can do what he can to
help coordinate.''
   As part of that attempt, Bush visited a 213-acre ranch in the
Orange County hillside that had been turned into a sophisticated
drug-trafficking clearinghouse, replete with hidden chutes and trap
doors to conceal the merchandise.
   On Thursday, before flying home to Washington, he sat at one of
a dozen multi-screen consoles at a Coast Guard drug-interdiction
communications center in Miami and watched a simulated drug bust in
which narcotics-running boats and planes were tracked and
apprehended.
   Bush has sought to minimize the significance of reaching the
100-day threshold, which will arrive Sunday, saying he succeeded a
man he served for eight years as vice president and that he never
intended substantial changes in the first months of his presidency.
   Sununu said the next 100 days will see Bush heavily involved in
the NATO summit in Brussels and the seven-nation economic summit in
Paris in July. Also, he said, Bush will focus heavily on trying to
push ahead with a more lasting budget-deficit agreement and will
work to see through Congress his proposals to save the beleaguered
savings and loan industry.
   The president also likely will spend time defending an expected
veto of legislation that Congress is expected to pass, raising the
minimum wage from the current $3.35-an-hour rate to $4.65. Bush
believes the rate should be no higher than $4.25.
   Sununu acknowledged that a package of crime legislation to
assist in the drug-crusade is not yet ready for announcement by the
White House or introduction in Congress.

   Five people, including a child, were
slain in one of the bloodiest nights on record in the Danish
capital, national TV reported Friday.
   Police believe a 27-year-old man went on a rampage and killed
three women and a young girl before he committed suicide in a
rented car.
   One of the women and the little girl were found murdered in the
man's apartment Friday morning. Police said they had a ``family
relationship'' with the man.
   Police also discovered the body of a 30-year-old woman who was
shot to death in her home while her family slept in another part of
the house. Around the same time, a woman in her 20s was found
stabbed to death in an apartment after neighbors called police
about a disturbance.
   Police later found the man in a car parked nearby, and they said
he had shot himself.
   Police also connected the man with two attempted murders
Thursday.
   In the fifth, unrelated slaying, an elderly man was stabbed to
death in his apartment. A 20-year-old prostitute was arrested in
the slaying.
   No identities were released.

   A Panamanian official today accused the
United States of trying to provoke chaos in his country prior to
national elections as an excuse for U.S. military intervention.
   Jorge Ritter, Panama's foreign minister, said Washington has
given millions of dollars to opposition candidates and said the
U.S. Army has sent special urban warfare units to its bases in the
Canal Zone.
   ``American plans to interfere in the Panamanian electoral
process have entered a phase of direct participation by the United
States with the goal of disturbing the public order and propagating
chaos, prompting general destabilization in the country around the
time of the elections to create an excuse for military
intervention,'' he told the Security Council.
   Ritter implied that if the opposition did not defeat the
pro-government candidates, U.S. armed forces would foment disorder
and back a coup attempt.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering replied that Panama was
concocting claims of U.S. interference to conceal ``its lack of
freedom and its apparent intention to conduct fraudulent
elections'' on May 7. Pickering said the government of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega is doctoring voting lists and restricting the entry
of journalists and independent election observers.
   Noriega, the armed forces commander and de facto ruler of
Panama, is backing Carlos Alberto Duque for the presidency against
opposition candidate Guillermo Endara. Endara has denied that his
Democratic Alliance campaign has received any U.S. money.
   Two vice presidents, 67 assembly representatives and 510 local
representatives also will be chosen.
   Noriega was indicted on federal drug charges in Florida in
February 1988. Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle then tried
to fire him, and Noriega had the National Assembly oust Delvalle.
   Noriega has blamed the United States for all Panama's problems,
and accused Washington of trying to renege on a treaty to transfer
control of the Panama Canal to Panama by the end of the century.

<HEAD>Eds: Adds 5 grafs with what other critics said</HEAD>

   Pow! Bam! Zap! Thud!
   So goes ``Starmites,'' the futuristic comic book musical that
arrived Thursday at Broadway's Criterion Center.
   The show purports to be a salute to the fabled sci-fi
superheroes of DC and Marvel comics. Instead, it trashes them,
trampling on their sense of fun, style and most of all, adventure.
   Don't look for the exuberance George Lucas captured on film more
than a decade ago in ``Star Wars,'' or the innocent dumb fun of the
mid-1950s ``Superman'' television series starring George Reeves.
They are missing here.
   Barry Keating, who wrote the music and lyrics for ``Starmites,''
and Stuart Ross who, along with Keating, concocted the book, can't
settle on the right tone for their meager story. It vacillates
between high camp and sappy, juvenile comedy.
   The tale concerns a young girl, Eleanor, who lives in her own
fantasy world of comic books. She's pulled into Inner Space,
Earth's parallel dimension, and a meeting with the Starmites who
are sort of an intergalactic version of the Guardian Angels.
   These good guys are led by Spacepunk, played by Brian Lane Green
who bears an uncanny resemblance to ``Star Wars'' hero Harrison
Ford. Green acts with the same breezy and appealing nonchalance and
has a good voice, too.
   Eleanor is played by Liz Larsen whose show business savvy and
brash, belting style of selling a song are at odds with her
supposedly waif-like character.
   They end up meeting Trinkulus, a lizard-like creature who sings
what sounds like off-key, soft-rock madrigals, and Diva, the tough,
brassy leader of the Banshees. As played by Sharon McNight, Diva
resembles the late drag artist Divine, only her crew cut is a
little more punkish. Miss McNight certainly can put over a number.
Her ``Hard to Be Diva'' pretty much stops the show, although it
wasn't going much of anywhere.
   The villain of the piece, a steel-plated warrior called Shak
Graa, looks like a tin-can version of Darth Vader and sounds like
the Phantom of the Opera with a head cold.
   The minimal plot includes a feeble love triangle involving
Spacepunk, Eleanor and Diva's daughter, Bizarbara, also played by
Miss Larsen. You may not care who wins out, but true love does
triumph in the end.
   At least director Larry Carpenter gets the actors through the
dialogue quickly and choreographer Michele Assaf has experly
drilled the cast. But it's hard to judge their expertise when they
are forced to jump around on stage to something called ``The Dance
of Spousal Arousal.''
   The production's special effects are negligible. Set designer
Lowell Detweiler has provided a nice backdrop of twinkly stars but
the rest of his designs, including a giant bird that unfolds its
wings to reveal a throne, are suprisingly tacky.
   The costumes are worse, especially for the women. Diva and her
quartet of leather-clad ladies-in-waiting are dressed by designer
Susan Hirschfeld to look like extras out of ``Ilsa, the She-Wolf of
the SS.''
   Keating's score slips from memory as soon as it's heard. It's
cartoonish in the worst sense, crude and obvious. The music and
lyrics have none of the wit and sophistication that Charles Strouse
and Lee Adams displayed in ``It's a Bird! It's a Plane! It's
Superman!'' (one of the theater's most unjustly neglected scores),
or the Broadway professionalism that Strouse and Martin Charnin
managed to pack into ``Annie.''
   ``Starmites'' is the first production at the Criterion Center
Stage Right, one part of a new theater complex in Times Square. Its
other theater, a cabaret space, housed ``Suds,'' a lamentable
celebration of Golden Oldies, last fall. What ``Suds'' did to those
hits of the 1950s and '60s, ``Starmites'' does to the comics.
Where's ``Little Lulu'' now that we really need her?
   What other critics said:
   Clive Barnes in the New York Post wrote, ``The trouble with it _
even before the music and lyrics _ is the idea. It is a foolish
idea for a musical. And nothing in the theater can redeem folly
except a circus. And this is no circus.''
   Howard Kissel in the Daily News said, ``In the last few years a
whole new genre has emerged, musicals that have no intrinsic merit
but are suitable for leaving the kids while you go shopping.
   ``In this genre, you have `Cats,' `Starlight Express' and now
`Starmites.' In this genre, you don't judge a musical by its
content but rather by its visuals. Will they live up to the
expectations of kids suckled on MTV? Here `Starmites' is a sort of
trailblazer. ... the style of the show is Tacky High-Tech, surely a
new category with loads of potential.''
   Mel Gussow of The New York Times wrote, ``To its credit,
`Starmites' never takes itself too seriously and is always tongue
in cheek. It remains a light-hearted space flight.''

   A runaway ``greenhouse effect'' has
eliminated any trace of water. Volcanoes number not in the hundreds
or thousands, but the hundreds of thousands. Its crushing
atmospheric pressure, suffice it to say, could never support
anything resembling human life.
   Venus is not exactly Kansas.
   For eight months beginning in August 1990, the space probe
Magellan will circle the second planet from the Sun, using
computer-enhanced radar images to study a planet so inhospitable
that its 900-degree surface temperature would melt lead.
   Yet, for all its alien qualities, scientists think the Magellan
mission will yield valuable information about the formation of
Earth.
   ``The most likely scenario is that we'll find something that
will completely astound and baffle us,'' said Steve Saunders,
Magellan's chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena. The craft was being ferried into space aboard the shuttle
Atlantis, to be launched from Earth orbit on its 15-month
trajectory to Venus.
   Pictures from Magellan should help scientists deduce ``the
probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _
somewhere else,'' said geologist Laurence Soderblom, a scientist
working on the Magellan project.
   Peering through acid-laden clouds, Magellan should give
scientists their best look yet at a planet so outwardly different
from the garden of Earth yet apparently shaped by the same geologic
processes.
   ``Of all the planets in the solar system, Venus is most like our
own Earth in size, mass and distance from the sun,'' NASA says.
   Among the common forces, scientists say, are volcanic eruptions,
meteorite impacts and, perhaps, continental drift, the evolutionary
movement of huge land masses. Magellan will also look for evidence
of wind and water erosion and test the bounds of Venus' gravity.
   The image of Venus formed by pictures taken from earlier U.S.
and Soviet space probes is of a planet where molten rock lies so
close to the solid crust surface that impacting meteorites might
produce volcanic eruptions, where hundreds of thousands of
volcanoes stretch for thousands of miles across lowland plains,
where continent-sized highlands sprout mountains dwarfing Everest.
   Magellan, once it begins orbiting Venus on Aug. 10, 1990, will
look for ancient stream channels, shorelines and other evidence the
planet once may have had oceans. Scientists believe an unchecked
``greenhouse effect'' _ in which the carbon dioxide atmosphere
acted like greenhouse glass and trapped solar heat _ raised the
temperature until water disappeared.
   It's a $550-million project with the scientific world watching.
   ``Part of the answer is knowing whether Earth is a fluke or just
one of the natural consequences of the evolution of a generic solar
system,'' said Soderblom, who works for the U.S. Geological Survey
in Flagstaff, Ariz.
   Scientists will probe the gravity forces of Venus by plotting
the path of Magellan as it swoops to within 155 miles of the
planet's surface and then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4,977
miles.
   In looking for similarities between Venus and Earth, scientists
begin by noting that they are roughly the same size, weight and
distance from the Sun, and are both bigger than Earth's moon,
Mercury and Mars.
   Heavenly bodies ``are a lot like potatoes. The big ones stay hot
for a long time, and the little ones cool off quickly,'' said
Saunders, himself a geologist.
   The moon, Mercury and Mars have cold surfaces free of
continental drift. Because a planet's internal heat ``drives the
geological machinery,'' however, scientists believe Venus and Earth
both give off heat through volcanic activity and movements of
gargantuan pieces of rock along the planetary crust, Saunders said.
   Magellan should help scientists learn if any of the Venusian
volcanoes are still erupting and how crustal rock movements differs
from that on Earth.
   Rock in Earth's crust is created and recycled in a conveyor-belt
manner. Hot crustal rock is born along midocean ridges _ undersea
mountain chains thousands of miles long. New crust is pushed away
from these ridges as more rock emerges. The crust eventually
collides with lighter continental rock, such as at the ``subduction
zone'' where Pacific seafloor rock sinks beneath Alaska, Washington
and Oregon.
   Heat is released as sinking rock melts, creating volcanoes.
   Earth releases most of its heat at midocean ridges and
subduction zones. Saunders and Gerald Schaber, another USGS
geologist, believe Venus loses its internal heat mostly through
``hot spot'' volcanoes.
   On Earth, such volcanoes form where molten rock rises through
thin parts of the crust, such as in Hawaii. But there's evidence
that Venus has crustal movement similar to Earth and that the
volcanic ranges may be the Venusian equivalent of Earth's midocean
ridges.
   No one yet has found conclusive evidence of subduction zones on
Venus. In places, however, folded mountains and valleys are
squeezed up against Venus' continent-like highlands, Aphrodite and
Ishtar, the latter of which has mountains taller than Everest.
   These regions look something like Earth's Himalayas, mountains
formed when India smashed into China. So crustal movements on Venus
may be ``thin-skinned,'' forming folded mountains without large
chunks of crustal rock diving deep into the planet, Schaber said.
   If large plates of Venus' crustal rock are in motion, ``you can
bet there's Venusquakes,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   More than three-quarters of people
trying to quit smoking were able to do so with the help of nicotine
patches in a study at the Mayo Clinic, researchers reported today.
   In a six-week study that started last fall, 77 percent of the
people who wore nicotine patches had stopped smoking, said Dr.
Richard Hurt, director of Mayo's Smoking Cessation Center and one
of the investigators.
   The silver-dollar-sized patches slowly release nicotine through
the skin to the bloodstream. A control group in the study wore
patches not treated with nicotine, and only 39 percent of them quit
smoking.
   ``There were remarkable differences between the two groups,''
Hurt said.
   While cautioning that a long-term follow-up study is needed,
Hurt said the patch could be a ``remarkable advancement'' as a tool
for helping people stop smoking.
   The patch, similar to those used for dispensing some kinds of
medicine, contains 30 milligrams of nicotine. About 1 milligram of
nicotine is absorbed through the skin every hour so smokers are
better able to cope with the withdrawal symptoms associated with
quitting smoking.
   The Mayo Clinic is one of four centers studying the patch for
possible Food and Drug Administration approval. Results of Mayo's
study of 62 people were the first to be reported, and were to be
released today during a national conference of the American Medical
Society on Alcohol and Other Drug Dependencies in Atlanta.
   Other studies have shown an 8 percent quitting rate over a
one-year period among people who use such methods as physician's
advice, nicotine gum and self-help programs to try to quit smoking.
The one-year quitting rate has been about 25 percent to 30 percent
among those who participate in a formal smoking cessation program.
   The patch was developed by Elan pharmaceutical company in
Gainesville, Ga. Hurt said researchers are not sure how long it may
take before the nicotine patch, if it proves successful, will be
available for commercial use.

   A four-lane bridge on a major city
thoroughfare was closed after inspectors discovered one of its
footings had eroded, transportation officials said.
   Authorities closed the U.S. 51 bridge over the Wolf River in
north Memphis on Thursday night, said Ken Renner, spokesman for
Gov. Ned McWherter.
   The closure, ordered by state Transportation Commissioner Jimmy
Evans, was temporary, pending a full inspection, Renner said.
   Inspectors, engineers and divers were expected to determine
Friday if the bridge could be reopened or should remain closed
until the problems are corrected, Renner said.
   The decision comes in the wake of a mass inspection following
two fatal bridge collapses in Tennessee this month.
   ``We've had crews of inspectors out over the last several weeks
inspecting well over a hundred bridges in west Tennessee looking
for any additional erosion problems,'' Renner said.
   Inspectors looking at the Wolf River bridge discovered
``considerable scouring'' on one end of one of the span's footings,
he said.
   Eight people died when a two-lane span of U.S. Highway 51
collapsed into the Hatchie River near Covington on April 1. Another
bridge collapsed April 15 in Anderson County in East Tennessee,
killing a motorist and injuring two companions.

<TEXT>
   Gil Shaham was at his New York City high school
reciting Chaucer when he received a summons that seemed straight
out of the storybooks.
   Israeli violin virtuoso Itzhak Perlman had an ear infection and
couldn't perform at two London concerts, and Shaham was asked to
stand in on two days' notice.
   The first of the concerts ended Thursday night with cheers and
flowers for the 18-year-old violinist after his performance of the
difficult Violin Concerto No. 1 by Max Bruch.
   ``This is something I've never had before,'' said Shaham,
perspiring in his dressing room at the Royal Festival Hall
afterward, as he stared at the basket of flowers.
   Shaham, from the Bronx, was reciting the prologue from Chaucer's
``The Canterbury Ttales'' in an English examination at Horace Mann
High School on Tuesday when he was called out and asked to fly to
London next day.
   Shaham promptly took three days off school.
   Eleanor Hope, his London agent, said telephone consultations
with Shaham's general manager in New York and conductor Michael
Tilson-Thomas of the London Symphony Orchestra decided on the Bruch
concerto, followed by Jean Sibelius' Violin Concerto on Friday.
   Asked how well he knew the works, the tall, chubby-faced
musician grinned and said: ``I was nervous because I felt I could
not fill in for Perlman. I last played the Bruch in December and
the Sibelius in the summer.''
   ``But the funny thing is,'' he added, ``I had some bizarre
premonition about this. On Monday, I changed the strings on my
Guadagnini (violin), which I always do before a concert, although I
wasn't booked for any concert this week.''
   ``I'm always nervous when he plays but I wasn't tonight,'' said
his astrophysicist father, Jacob Shaham. ``I knew that nothing
could go wrong.''
   ``I didn't know that,'' his son chimed in. ``But with an
orchestra like that and Tilson-Thomas I felt completely
comfortable.''
   Shaham said he began playing violin when he was seven and wants
to be a professional. He said he had never been so rushed before.
   ``I once had to stand in for Yehudi Menuhin who had flu in
Norfolk, Va.,'' he said. ``But I had a week's notice of that.''
   Shaham is practically unknown in London although he was here
once before in debut with the London Symphony in May 1987 and again
in March 1988.
   Concertgoers Nicola Constable and Helen Munro of The Strad, a
London music magazine, praised Shaham's performance.
   ``I thought he was brilliant. It must have been dreadful for him
to know he was replacing Perlman but nobody could have been
disappointed and it's difficult to play Bruch well,'' Miss
Constable said.
   ``I thought he was incredibly mature for 18,'' said Miss Munro.
``I wonder where he can go now if he can play like this after only
10 years. That's not long for any instrument but the violin in
particular is so technically difficult.''
   Shaham studies music at the Juilliard School in New York and has
important bookings with European orchestras this season. He also is
scheduled for tours of Japan and the Soviet Union.
   Ms. Hope said Shaham practiced at his London hotel until past
midnight on Wednesday, taking over a deserted banqueting room
because the acoustics were better there than in his bedroom.

   President Bush has accused the Panamanian
government of setting up ``systematic fraud'' for an upcoming
election, but that country's foreign minister today accused the
United States of interfering in Panama's electoral process.
   The United States would ``not recognize fraudulent election
results engineered by (Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio)
Noriega,'' Bush said in a statement released during his visit
Thursday to Clearwater, Fla.
   ``In recent weeks, the Noriega regime has taken steps to commit
systematic fraud,'' Bush said.
   But Jorge Ritter, Panama's foreign minister, told the United
Nations Security Council today, ``American plans to interfere in
the Panamanian electoral process have entered a phase of direct
participation by the United States with the goal of disturbing the
public order and propagating chaos, prompting general
destabilization in the country around the time of the elections to
create an excuse for military intervention.''
   Ousted Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle met Thursday in
Washington with Secretary of State James A. Baker III to discuss
the May 7 balloting. He told reporters that opposition parties in
his country did not receive any covert aid from the United States
and branded such reports as a cover-up by Noriega.
   ``I believe Noriega has looked for an excuse to take away from
the people's attention what is going on in Panama,'' Delvalle said
in response to a question.
   Reports published last week in U.S. media said President Bush
had signed a secret intelligence directive, called a ``finding,''
to provide $10 million to the general's opponents in the
presidential elections. The White House has said it will not
comment on intelligence matters.
   Earlier Thursday, the acting Panamanian ambassador, Juan B.
Sosa, called those reports of covert aid the centerpiece of a
misinformation campaign by Noriega.
   ``There is absolutely no truth to that,'' Sosa said. ``The
opposition has run a meager campaign because they have no money.''
   Delvalle and Sosa are exiles who still are recognized by the
United States as legitimate leaders. Noriega ousted Delvalle in
February 1988 after the president called for the general's ouster.
The move came a few weeks after Noriega was indicted by a federal
grand jury in Miami on drug trafficking charges.
   ``As long as Gen. Noriega remains in power there cannot be and
will not be any improvement in relations with Panama,'' Baker said,
repeating the official U.S. stance taken since shortly after the
drug indictment.
   The secretary of state also said former U.S. presidents Gerald
R. Ford and Jimmy Carter would be among a group of international
observers for the May 7 presidential elections.
   ``It will be interesting if he refuses to admit them as
observers,'' Baker said.
   The May 7 elections pits Noriega's candidate, Carlos Alberto
Duque, against Guillermo David Endara, running on an
anti-government coalition ticket. The United States has been
forecasting Noriega will rig the elections, issuing statements
claiming the Panamanian leaders manipulated voter lists and
intimidated opposition figures.
   ``Up till now Gen. Noriega has not shown any reason to believe
they (the elections) will be fair and free,'' Delvalle said after
the meeting with Baker, which ended with them both being trapped
briefly in a State Department elevator.
   Sosa said earlier the observers should watch the setting up of
the polls, the actual balloting and the counting. The acting
Panamanian ambassador said Noriega was attempting to steal the
elections.
   He said recent Noriega maneuvers included the detention of an
American journalist, mandatory visas ``to keep people away,'' and
limited access by the opposition to the media.
   Newsweek reporter Charles Lane was detained Wednesday for
several hours by the Panamanian Defense Forces for allegedly
possessing a dollar bill bearing anti-Noriega slogans. State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called it ``a typical
instance of an absence of political freedom and basic civil
liberties in Panama.''
   Sosa said the Panamanian regime's appearance before the Security
Council today to ``denounce aggression by the United States'' was
to ``deviate from the real issue: the country is held hostage by a
dictator.''
   The internal problems in Panama broke out in June 1987 when a
former military officer linked Noriega to drug trafficking, money
laundering and election fraud. The United States cut off economic
and military aid in 1987. Sanctions were imposed last year, shortly
after the indictment in Miami.

<HEAD>Housing Program Used to `Feather Nests' of Former Reagan Officials</HEAD>

   An investigation into a $225 million federal
housing program shows it was used during the Reagan years ``to
feather the financial nest'' of former administration officials and
other prominent Republicans, the House Banking Committee chairman
says.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said he will hold hearings on
the report by the inspector general of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, which suggested favoritism and cronyism in
awarding federal housing renovation contracts.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said today the program ``was being
abused by consultants and some folks who were making a phone call
and getting a federal grant.'' Kemp, who addressed to a gathering
of state legislators, has halted further spending on the program
pending a review of projects.
   The report, released this week, documented how former Reagan
administration figures and other Republicans raked in handsome
profits on consulting contracts to rehabilitate subsidized
apartments for the poor.
   The consultants included President Reagan's first interior
secretary, James Watt; the late John Mitchell, attorney general
under President Nixon; former Republican Sen. Ed Brooke of
Massachusetts, and former Kentucky Gov. Louis Nunn, also a
Republican.
   Other consultants included former top HUD officials under
Reagan-era Secretary Samuel Pierce, with one charging fees of $1.3
million. Still other former officials under Pierce participated as
developers in projects to renovate subsidized housing for the poor,
benefited by the HUD contracts.
   Inspector General Paul Adams drew a comparison with the Pentagon
procurement scandal, with former government officials drawing big
fees as consultants to developers seeking government contracts.
   But Adams said he had found no evidence that active HUD
officials had been involved in influence-peddling and made no
charges of criminal activity.
   The rehab program is a $225 million a year endeavor that
survived in Congress despite efforts by the Reagan administration
to kill it. Through it, developers win contracts to acquire and
renovate existing housing and receive HUD guarantees of subsidized
rents for 15 years.
   ``It is indeed ironic that a program that the Reagan
administration had sought to terminate for six years was misused to
feather the financial nest of HUD and administration favorites,''
Gonzalez said Thursday.
   He praised the action by Kemp, who ordered a halt to 35 pending
awards worth $100 million and audits of existing contracts.
   Adams said that while he had found no illegality in HUD's
Moderate Rehabilitation Program, contracts were distributed in ways
that suggested favoritism and use of insider information.
   Money for over half the units audited went to just 10 states,
which by HUD formulas were entitled to just 16 percent.
   Adams said he had turned over the 700-page investigative report
to the FBI and Justice Department.
   Adams said in a memo to Kemp that developers and local public
housing agencies ``were led to believe the consultants enjoyed a
special relationship with persons making recommendations and
decisions.''
   Addressing the Pentagon purchasing scandal, Adams said in his
memo:
   ``In Defense, the contractors were paying consultants to obtain
information to influence contract awards. At HUD, the developers
were paying consultants to influence awards of moderate
rehabilitation units to public housing authorities.
   ``The difference between the two situations is that the
investigation at Defense was able to prove that the consultants
paid government employees for information and for selecting a
particular contractor. Our investigation at HUD was unable to
substantiate that government employees received any financial
consideration from the consultants.''
   Adams' report questioned the role of Thomas T. Demery, the
former assistant secretary and federal housing commissioner, who
was responsible for the program beginning in 1986. The
investigation looked into contracts going back to 1984.
   Investigators found that a nonprofit charity, FOOD for Africa,
which Demery headed before joining HUD, received $290,000 from
recipients of HUD contracts under the program.
   Demery, defending his role in a telephone interview, called the
investigative report ``misleading'' and said projects were not
awarded based on favoritism. He said it was understandable that
former HUD officials would become involved in projects after
leaving government because they had developed special knowledge in
a narrow, highly technical program.
   ``If they won those contracts, it wasn't because of inside
information,'' Demery said.
   Adams' report named 11 former HUD officials who participated in
project contracts as developers and owners, consultants, or
representatives of lenders.
   Among them was former Under Secretary Philip Abrams and former
Assistant Secretary for Housing Philip Winn. Both were presidential
appointees, and later became owner-developers in half a dozen
rehabilitation projects.
   Winn is now the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland; efforts to reach
him through the State Department were unsuccessful.
   Abrams did not return a reporter's call to his Colorado office.
   Others included Joseph Strauss, a former special assistant to
Pierce, who the report said collected $1.3 million in consultant
fees on such projects. Pierce's one-time executive assistant, Lance
Wilson, was identified as an owner-developer in six projects.
   Watt collected a $300,000 fee as a consultant on a 312-unit
project in Essex, Md. Investigators reported that he ``said that
his role was to talk to the `right people' and convince them that
the project was needed,'' the report said.
   It said Nunn was paid $375,000 as attorney and consultant on a
1984 Miami project in which he in turn paid Mitchell $75,000 for
his assistance.
   ``Nunn claimed Mitchell told him he had HUD contacts from the
top on down, because he and (Pierce) ... were friends,'' the report
said. Pierce told investigators that he knew Mitchell but that
Mitchell had never discussed HUD matters with him.
   Brooke was paid $183,000 as consultant, most of that in a Lynn,
Mass., deal. Also named as a consultant who received $260,000 in
fees was Frederick Bush, no relation to the president, who has been
nominated as ambassador to Luxembourg.
   Calls to Watt, Nunn and Brooke were not immediately returned.

   City police and federal agents seized 20
weapons, including a grenade launcher, and arrested six people in a
raid on a motel in the capital's northeast section early today.
   A Nazi flag was found in one of two cars with Texas license
plates searched during the raid, said John Kelso, assistant special
agent in charge of the FBI's Washington field office.
   The investigation started Thursday afternoon when a suburban
Dallas woman called the FBI's Dallas field office to report that
her son, John Barnhart, 33, of Rowlette, Texas, had been kidnapped.
The unidentified woman said Barnhart, who had been missing two
weeks, instructed her to wire him $1,000 here or ``some harm would
come to him,'' according to Kelso.
   FBI agents traced the man to the motel and quickly determined
that he hadn't been kidnapped, Kelso said.
   ``Apparently they may have been low on funds and this may have
been an effort by him to get some additional funds,'' Kelso said.
``It's unfortunate that he would involve his mother.''
   FBI agents discovered the hotel rooms contained automatic
weapons and notified city police, the Secret Service and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the FBI official said.
   Two of the suspects _ Richard William McEwen, 40, and his wife,
Billie Joy McEwen, 43, both of Rowlette _ suffered minor injuries
during the police raid when officers had to restrain them from
reaching their weapons, said police spokesman Joseph Gentile. Both
were briefly treated at D.C. General Hospital and released to
police custody.
   The other suspects, in addition to Barnhart, were identified as
Margaret Arredondo, 29, of Dallas; Kevin Owen, 21, of Washington,
D.C.; and Diane Joy McEwen, 28, of Rowlette.
   All were charged with violating the National Firearms Act.
Arraignment was scheduled for later today in federal court.
   Kelso said authorities were still trying to determine why the
suspects were at the Econolodge, where they had been staying for
several days, and what they were planning to do with the weapons.
   The weapons seized included a grenade launcher attached to a
rifle, some zip guns, several pistols, silencers, and a variety of
other semi-automatic and automatic arms, said police Capt. Philip
A. O'Donnell.
   ``They're very destructive sort of weapons,'' said Kelso. ``They
have the power to kill people or to inflict serious bodily injury.''
   Six children aged 7 to 15 were found in the motel rooms and
taken into protective custody, Kelso said.

<TEXT>
   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge plunged 0.7 percent in March, the second straight decline and
the biggest drop in eight months, the Commerce Department said
today.
   It was the first time the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,
which dropped 0.3 percent in February, had posted back-to-back
declines since it fell for five straight months from September 1987
through January 1988, the months surrounding the October stock
market crash.
   While many analysts feared that the nation was headed for a
recession after the market collapse, the economy rebounded with
vigor and the record peacetime expansion is now in its seventh year.
   Analysts said the latest negative signals from the leading index
are in line with signs that the U.S. economy is losing steam and
with widespread expectations that the slowdown will become more
pronounced as the year progresses.
   At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
report was ``not bad news and shows some slowing of the economy,
which is probably good.''
   ``Overall it shows the economy is still sound and moving on a
steady course,'' he said.
   Looking at the overall picture, Fitzwater said, ``Despite
declines in February and March, the average of the leading
indicators index for the first quarter is higher than the average
for the fourth quarter of 1988. The index affirms the slowdown from
the high levels of economic activity in 1988 and January of 1989.
These declines probably are transitional movements to a sustainable
rate of economic growth without accelerating inflation.''
   The debate among economists is whether the end result will be an
outright recession or a so-called ``soft landing,'' in which growth
slows just enough to relieve inflationary pressures without
bringing a halt to the expansion.
   The economy expanded at a strong 5.5 percent annual rate during
the first three months of the year, but the growth in the gross
national product was a more modest 3 percent, discounting a
statistical quirk reflecting the bounce back from last year's
drought.
   That was down somewhat from the drought-adjusted 3.5 percent
pace for the final quarter of 1988. Monthly reports on the
economy's performance in February and March suggested a progressive
weakening during the first quarter.
   ``The underlying growth rate in the economy is much below last
year and the risks of a recession certainly are higher,'' said
economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group in Washington. ``To be
a prudent planner, you have to take those risks into account.''
   March's decline in the leading index, which is designed to
predict economic activity six to nine months into the future, was
the biggest falloff since a 0.8 percent drop last July.
   The traditional signal of a recession is three straight declines
in the index. However, it has flashed two false recession signals
since the 1981-82 economic downturn, one of them in the months
after the stock market crash.
   In March, nine of the 11 indicators that make up the leading
index declined, with a drop in building permits counting as the
biggest negative factor.
   Other negatives included: a dip in manufacturers' orders for
consumer goods; a shorter average work week; an increase in initial
claims for jobless benefits; a drop in an index measuring consumer
confidence; faster vendor deliveries, signaling slower demand; a
contraction in the money supply; a decline in manufacturers'
unfilled orders and falling stock prices.
   Two indicators made positive contributions: a jump in prices for
raw materials, indicating stronger demand; and a gain in orders for
new plants and equipment.
   The various changes left the index at 144.4 percent of its 1982
base of 100. The index has advanced 0.5 percent over the past six
months, compared with a 2.1 percent rise over the previous
six-month period.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and control
inflation. The goal of the anti-inflation campaign is to prolong
the economic recovery, but some analysts think the unintentional
result will be a recession.
   ``The leading indicator is just another indicator of how the
economy has slowed down,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist for
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York. ``We're at a point now
where if the Federal Reserve doesn't back off, the slowdown could
very easily become a recession by or before the end of the year.''
   The Bush administration is projecting the economy will expand at
a moderate 3.2 percent pace this year.
   J. Antonio Villamil, chief economist for the Commerce
Department, said after the first-quarter GNP report was released on
Wednesday that ``there is nothing to indicate a recession in 1989
from these numbers.''
   He said the nation is experiencing ``solid, moderate growth with
the kind of mix we need at this stage of the expansion.''
   However, the latest consensus estimate from 50 analysts surveyed
by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter is less optimistic,
projecting this year's growth rate at 2.7 percent, with the pace
slipping to 1.2 percent by the fourth quarter.
   More than half of those surveyed now expect a recession to begin
by late this year or early in 1990.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will have at
least one opponent when parliament elects the country's new
president next month, the head of the Tass news agency said Friday.
   Leonid Kravchenko, director general of the official Soviet news
agency, said a group of Moscow deputies plans to present an
alternative candidate to Gorbachev. He did not identify the
deputies and said he did not know who their candidate was.
   ``I know from the sentiment of Moscow there are a group of
Moscow deputies who are going to present an alternative candidate.
They didn't tell me who it was. This is not to express distrust of
Gorbachev, but to stress the commitment to democracy,'' he told a
news conference.
   The new 2,250-seat Congress of People's Deputies will choose the
Soviet president and elect 542 of its members to a new full-time
legislature, the Supreme Soviet. The president also will be
chairman of the Supreme Soviet.
   The congress will meet May 25-June 1, the Tass executive said.
   Gorbachev, who replaced Andrei A. Gromyko as president on Oct.
1, is expected to be chosen. Kravchenko was the first Soviet
official to state publicly that the election would be contested.
   Kravchenko, one of 1,500 deputies elected by voters to the
congress, said the president would be chosen in the early days of
the meeting and ``one thing is certain, the procedure will be
conducted by secret ballot.''
   He said any deputy could propose a candidate ``and the congress
will decide whether to accept the nomination.''
   Asked whether Gorbachev's opponent might be former Moscow party
boss Boris N. Yeltsin, the political maverick elected to the
congress in a landslide following an anti-establishment campaign,
Kravchenko replied: ``To stand as an alternative candidate against
Gorbachev, I don't think he would want to do that.''
   Ten days before the March 26 election, the Communist Party
Central Committee started an investigation of charges that Yeltsin
opposed some party policies.
   Kravchenko said none of the speakers at Tuesday's Central
Committee meeting, which he attended, brought up Yeltsin because
they realized that a discussion ``would be untimely and hopeless.''
   ``In all probability, he (Yeltsin) will be nominated to the
Supreme Soviet and he stands a good chance to be elected'' by the
congress, Kravchenko said.
   Kravchenko indicated deputies from different regions would
decide among themselves on slates of nominees for the Supreme
Soviet.
   It has been suggested, he said, that all deputies to the
congress from Moscow _ those elected by the public as well as those
chosen from the party and social and professional organizations _
meet May 3. At the meeting, he said, they would decide on a slate
for the Supreme Soviet, choosing one nominee from every five
deputies.
   Kravchenko said he expected the same thing to be done in other
areas in order to get a ``consolidated list.''
   Speaking of the inaugural meeting of the Congress of People's
Deputies, Kravchenko said, ``My prediction is there will be a very,
very sharp debate.''
   He said he expected the selection of the new Supreme Soviet to
take the first two days, after which there would be a short recess.
The first session of the Supreme Soviet probably will be held about
June 12, he said.
   Asked about the criticism of Gorbachev at Tuesday's Central
Committee meeting, he said the ``very critical'' speeches were the
result of two major changes in the Soviet Union which haven't kept
pace with each other, social-economic development and political
reform.
   ``We hoped there would be some harmony between the two but
unfortunately this has not come to pass. In the new political
structure, there is no doubt great success. Unfortunately, success
in the social-economic sphere leaves much to be desired,'' he said.
   Kravchenko mentioned shortages of consumer goods, higher
inflation, social tensions and corruption. He cited proposed
reforms including a reduction in state expenditures, a curtailment
of capital investment projects and a reduction in defense spending,
including the diversion of $9.7 million to the health sector.
   Vladimir Popov, the deputy director of Soviet radio and
television, when asked how the Soviets assessed the criticism,
replied: ``Our assessment is pretty good. We regard them as
realistic in today's life. Instead of complacency and good words,
we would rather have serious criticism about serious matters.''
   Kravchenko and Popov met reporters at the 35-nation East-West
conference, which is meeting in London to monitor an accord on
media and information signed in Vienna in January. Both are Soviet
delegates.

<HEAD>Former Teamsters President Roy Williams Dies</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with details of death, background and survivors.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEETON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Teamsters president Roy Lee Williams,
who served three years in prison for bribery, died today at his
farm home after a lengthy bout with emphysema and heart problems.
He was 74.
   Williams, a protege of former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa,
served as international president of the Teamsters union from
1981-83.
   He was forced to resign after he and four co-defendants were
convicted in December 1982 of trying to bribe former U.S. Sen.
Howard Cannon of Nevada to influence trucking deregulation. Cannon
was not charged in the case.
   Williams served three years of a 10-year sentence before he was
released from federal prison in September.
   A family spokesman said a doctor was called to the Williams
house about 70 miles southeast of Kansas City about 5 a.m. when
Williams experienced trouble breathing. The spokesman said Williams
did not want to go to the hospital at that time and went back to
sleep.
   Dr. Mark Vogt said he returned to the house with paramedics
after Williams became acutely ill but he could not be revived.
Williams died of complications of emphysema, Vogt said.
   Teamsters headquarters in Washington had no immediate comment on
Williams' death.
   William J. McCarthy, president of the Teamsters, had no kind
words for Williams or Hoffa when he testified before Congress April
4: ``One was a cheat and one was a liar and both were mixed up with
La Cosa Nostra by their own admissions. I didn't care for either
one of them,'' he said.
   Williams claimed he was set up in the attempted bribery case.
   In an interview early this year, Williams said: ``I am still
just an old truck driver at heart. It's over now and I am glad of
it. I still have to meet my maker. But I can still say I didn't do
nothing wrong.''
   Williams testified at a casino skimming trial in Kansas City
several years ago that he had received payments from Nick Civella,
the late Kansas City crime boss, for helping mob figures obtain a
$60 million loan from a union pension fund. Williams said in an
interview later that he did so only after his family was threatened
and on the advice of Hoffa.
   In his testimony, which he gave in an attempt to have his
sentence reduced, Williams said that he received payoffs of $1,500
a month from Civella for seven years when he was a local labor
leader. He said Civella played a key role in his election to the
union's international presidency.
   Williams also testified by videotape in a federal court trial in
New York against mob figures accused of fixing his election as
Teamsters president, and that of his successor, Jackie Presser, who
died last July. Three co-defendants were acquitted of that charge
in May 1988, but convicted of unrelated charges.
   Williams is survived by two daughters and a grandson.

   The shuttle Atlantis and its five
astronauts were ready for a midafternoon launch today on a mission
to start a robot craft streaking toward Venus, the cloud-shrouded
planet that is an abiding mystery to scientists.
   The crew finished final spacecraft checks and NASA officials
said the space probe called Magellan was ready as the 23-minute
launch window approached. The schedule called for liftoff no
earlier than 2:24 p.m.
   Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, said launch of the
explorer craft Magellan will mark ``a resurgence of America's
planetary program.'' The last American probe to deep space was
dispatched in 1978.
   Preparations moved smoothly since the countdown began Tuesday. A
launch control commentator announced ``all conditions look good''
for launch time weather in Florida. Officials kept close watch on
wind conditions at emergency landing sites here and across the
Atlantic Ocean.
   Atlantis was scheduled to lift off at 2:24 p.m. EDT, heading to
orbit on a four-day mission 184 miles above Earth.
   Launch pad workers completed fueling early this morning. After
breakfast, the astronauts donned the bright orange launch suits
they would wear into space. They smiled and waved to NASA workers
as they headed to their beachfront launch pad.
   Magellan is to be released from Atlantis' cargo bay six hours
after launch and sent streaking on a 15-month, 806 million-mile
unmanned trip of its own.
   Mission specialists Mary Cleave and Mark Lee will operate remote
controls that propel Magellan from the shuttle's cargo bay.
Atlantis is commanded by David M. Walker. The other crew members
are pilot Ronald Grabe and mission specialist Norman Thagard.
   The liftoff opportunity, dictated by Magellan's path to Venus
and lighting conditions at emergency landing sites, lasts only 23
minutes, one of the shortest launch windows in shuttle history.
   After its release from the shuttle, Magellan's own rocket will
send it out of Earth orbit. Over the next 15 months, the craft will
fly around the sun 1{ times before settling into an orbit of Venus
in August 1990.
   Venus has intrigued humans as long as they've looked heavenward
and marveled at the universe. The planet, the familiar ``star'' of
the morning or evening, appears just before dawn or just after
sunset as a brilliant, unblinking point of light. Its brightness in
the nighttime sky is rivaled only by the moon.
   Venus is Earth's nearest neighbor, with an orbit 25.7 million
miles away, and the two often are considered to be sister planets
since they are about the same size. But the worlds differ mightily:
Dense clouds of carbon dioxide choke Venus, which has a surface
temperature of about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead.
   Magellan will be carrying some of the most sophisticated remote
mapping sensors ever sent to another planet.
   An imaging radar system will be able to detect features on the
surface as small as 100 yards, about the size of a football field.
The radar will be operated during almost 2,000 passes over the
Venusian surface, each time viewing a slice of the planet and then
sending the image back to Earth for computer enhancements.
   Magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of the surface
while orbiting Venus for about 243 Earth days, equal to a single
Venus day.
   The last U.S. planetary probe was the Pioneer-Venus, launched in
1978.
   Fisk said that in the 11 years since, ``we had a planetary
program that was in danger of being an also-ran.''
   Magellan is the first in a series of American planetary
exploration missions.
   Voyager 2, a probe launched in 1977 and an earlier visitor to
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, will fly past Neptune in August. In
October, the robot craft Galileo will be launched toward Jupiter. A
space telescope will be launched next year, followed by probes to
the sun in October 1990, and to Mars in 1992.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' Fisk said at a Thursday news conference.
   Its cloud cover blocks telescope views of Venus and until the
Space Age little was known about the planet's surface. Twenty space
probes have been sent to Venus, including four by the United
States, but only tiny fragments of the surface have been
photographed.
   Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist, said the Magellan
studies may help scientists understand how the Earth developed into
a place where life flourishes while Venus became a world of torrid
heat.

   Fantastic dreams of taking home all of a
record $115 million jackpot from Pennsylvania's Super 7 lottery
slipped away as 14 winning tickets turned up in an initial computer
scan of wagers.
   Lottery Executive Director Jim Scroggins said each of the 14
tickets will be worth $317,524.67 in annual payments over the next
26 years. If one person had won the jackpot, it would have been
worth $4.4 million a year.
   Still, the first winners to step forward were happy Thursday to
claim just a share, even if the money won't bring early retirements.
   ``It's better than nothing,'' said Gregory G. Samsa, of Warren,
Ohio, who served as spokesman for a group of 14 workers from the
Harbison-Walker brick factory in Windham, Ohio.
   If their ticket is validated, possibly early next week, each of
the 14 will get $22,680 a year before taxes for 26 years.
   Alverto Handel, 65, of Portage, Pa.; her son, Jim, 39, a coal
miner from Summerhill, Pa.; and daughter, Nancy Williams, 34, a
library technician at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point,
N.Y., also presented a ticket for validation.
   Holders of four more winning tickets checked in this morning,
lottery officials said, brining the number of claimings to step
forward to six families or groups.
   Two couples from the Erie area put in a claim for a ticket they
shared. They are Charles J. and Kathy Davis of McKean Township and
John and Rose White of Harborcreek Township. Asked how he felt,
Davis, 32, said, ``I can't even remember. I haven't slept.''
   A family from East Windsor, N.J., arrived early this afternoon.
Members of the Arthur Rosen family said the group had bought $80
worth of tickets after waiting one hour in line.
   Another winner, Sylvia Trapuzzano of Washington, Pa., said she
had spent Thursday in a Harrisburg-area motel pondering her good
fortune before putting in her claim.
   ``I was shocked and I couldn't believe it,'' she said as she was
led into lottery headquarters past a crowd of reporters and
photographers.
   Miss Trapuzzano said her father, Ben, had bought five tickets
for her and her two brothers and sister after she was unable to get
her own because of long lines.
   Also claiming tickets was a group from West Virginia: James
Evans; John Gardner; Lionel Herndon and his wife, Connie.
   Coincidentally, it was a year ago today that a bogus winning
ticket for a $15.2 million jackpot was turned in and a check for
nearly $470,000 was issued by lottery officials.
   An employee of the lottery's computer contractor who had access
to the system produced the fake ticket and an accomplice turned it
in. Lottery officials discovered the scheme several days later and
recovered the money. Both men received jail terms after pleading
guilty. The lottery has since beefed up its validation process,
which can take days to complete.
   A second set of computers must also validate the jackpot and the
number of winning tickets before both become official, Scroggins
said.
   Reports circulated Thursday about winners who were set to claim
shares of this week's jackpot.
   ``Just fine, no problem,'' Mrs. Williams said when asked about
having to share the jackpot.
   Mrs. Williams came up with six of the numbers from a computer
palm reader she had tried in an open air market during a Bahamas
vacation with her husband, Charles, in March. Her mother provided
the seventh number.
   She was at a bowling alley near her Fort Montgomery, N.Y., home
when her mother called her.
   ``It was a total shock ... I dropped the phone,'' Mrs. Williams
said.
   Mrs. Handel said she was so excited she nearly put the pencil
through the paper she was working on as she checked the lottery
numbers shotly after Wednesday's drawing. The winner was the first
ticket she checked.
   ``Tears came to my eyes,'' she said. ``I was so dumbfounded, I
couldn't even look at the other tickets.''
   Each of their shares will be worth $105,841 a year for 26 years.
They said they had no plans for the money yet.
   Besides getting less than they may have hoped for, members of
the Ohio group couldn't even get the detailed and lengthy
validation process started.
   The lottery usually tells winning groups who call in ahead of
time that they need a formal legal agreement spelling out how the
money will be disbursed. The group said they tried to call first,
but couldn't get through.
   ``They got excited ... and headed on down,'' Scroggins said
after the group drove six hours in a four-vehicle caravan.
   The group, which had bought $140 in tickets, contacted an Ohio
lawyer, who promised to have a contract delivered to lottery
headquarters today.
   Samsa called the legal holdup ``a slight disappointment, but
it's nothing we can't overcome.''

   Rescuers pulled 48 bodies from the
twisted wreckage of tornado-battered villages on Friday and a dozen
people died in hospitals, raising the death toll to 660, officials
said.
   Hundreds more remained missing and officials said deaths from
the storm may would exceed 1,000.
   Relatives of the dead wailed and recited holy chants as rescuers
labored in the debris in Saturia, one of more than 20 small
villages in central Bangladesh hit hard by the storm.
   The toll jumped sharply on Friday when rescuers recovered 40
bodies in Saturia and and nearby Harganj, according Relief Ministry
officials speaking on the condition they not be identified.
   Another eight bodies were found in the village of Dhamrai
Upazila, and 12 people injured in the storm died in hospitals, they
said.
   About 400 people have been listed as missing, including 200
fisherman whose boats were capsized.
   An army officer supervising the rescue, speakng on condition of
anoymity, said the final death toll may exceed 1,000. At least
12,000 people have been injured.
   The tornado swept into the Manikganj area, 25 miles northwest of
Dhaka, on Wednesday night, blowing away people, animals and houses.
Another tornado reportedly hit the Narsingdi district, 25 miles
east of the capital, killing five people and injuring 500.
   Saturia was perhaps the hardest hit.
   ``The tornado swooped on the area like an elephant trunk and
within minutes nothing except the dead and injured was left,'' said
Faruk Ahmed, a district official.
   The storm came during two months of draught that has wiped out
half of this impoverished nation's rice crop. Late last year,
torrential rains flooded more than two-thirds of the country, and a
cyclone killed hundreds of people.
   Nature's latest blow left Saturia, a village of 10,000 people, a
chaotic mass of twisted trees, utility poles and corrugated iron
sheets.
   A group of wailing and sobbing people carried a body to a burial
spot behind a crumbled building.
   ``I was here during the devastating flood last year in which
more than 20 persons had died. But I have not seen anything so
devastating as the tornado,'' Ahmed said.
   In the nearby village of Tilli Char, at least 80 people, some
seriously hurt, waited for medical attention outside a tin school
shed being used as a hospital.

<HEAD>Arab Burned in Failed Terror Attack, Police Say</HEAD>

   A kerosene-laden car driven by a Palestinian
holding a detonator burst into flames Friday on a busy Jerusalem
street, and police said it apparently was a failed attack by a
terrorist.
   In other incidents in the occupied territories, assailants shot
and killed a Palestinian suspected of cooperating with Israel, and
Israeli soldiers reportedly shot and wounded 10 Palestinians.
Another Palestinian, a 14-year-old boy, was shot in the head by
Jewish settlers, Arab reports said.
   The driver of the car that exploded near police headquarters in
Jerusalem was hospitalized with severe burns. There were no other
injuries.
   The car's trunk was loaded with six containers of kerosene and
two canisters of cooking gas, said police spokesman Uzi Sandori.
The man was seen holding a detonator just before the vehicle
exploded, he added.
   Police believe the car was being rigged as a bomb and went off
prematurely. ``We believe it might be a terrorist act that
failed,'' said Sandori.
   He identified the driver as a Palestinian from east Jerusalem's
Shoafat district who has a criminal record for disturbing the
peace. Sandori did not release the name of the man, a veterinarian
who once worked for the city.
   The army, meanwhile, confirmed a man died Friday when he was
shot in the mouth and head in the crowded main square of the West
Bank city of Nablus. A spokesman said they still are checking the
circumstances.
   Palestinian reporters said the victim, Kamel Abu Samt, 38, was
suspected of collaborating with Israel.
   His death brings to at least 40 the number of suspected
collaborators killed by fellow Palestinians since the December 1987
start of the uprising against Israeli occupation. Another 415
Palestinians have been shot and killed by Israeli troops.
Palestinians have killed 18 Israelis in that time.
   At Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital, 14-year-old Nader Mohammed Abu
Hamdia was in serious condition after being shot Friday by Jewish
settlers in the West Bank town of Hebron, Arab reports said.
   An army spokeswoman confirmed a Hebron resident was
hospitalized, and said authorities are investigating how he was
injured.
   Another gang of about 50 heavily armed West Bank settlers
marched through Jerusalem's Arab neighborhood of Silwan on Friday.
Some waved Israeli flags and shouted in Hebrew and Arabic: ``The
Jews are here! The Jews are here!''
   When about half a dozen Palestinian boys aged 8-10 stoned them
from a nearby hilltop, the settlers held their submachine guns up
in warning.
   The marchers then alerted police who fired tear gas to disperse
the stone throwers.
   Israel radio said downtown Hebron was declared a closed military
area after a series of clashes between soldiers and stone-throwing
Palestinians on Friday. Two Palestinians were wounded by army
gunfire, the radio said.
   An army spokeswoman also confirmed troops wounded a Palestinian
woman during clashes in Nablus.
   She said she is checking Arab hospital reports that seven other
Palestinians were shot and wounded by troops in confrontations in
the Gaza Strip.
   Also Friday, an army investigation found the use of gunfire by
border police during a search-and-arrest raid in the West Bank
village of Nahalin was ``exaggerated,'' Israel radio said.
   The 25 border policemen fired 150 live bullets, killing five
people and wounding at least 15 during the April 13 incident, the
radio quoted the report as saying.

   Romanian authorities briefly detained a U.S.
Embassy official who met with a critic of the Communist government
and the United States has filed a protest, State Department
officials said Friday.
   While under international law, contacts between diplomats and
local citizens are permissible, the incident is being played down
by the department and the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest out of concern
that additional strictures might be imposed on Romanians.
   Despite the economic and political reform movement sweeping the
Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary, the government of Prime Minister
Nicolae Ceausescu remains hard-line in its policies.
   The diplomat's identify was withheld. Margaret Tutwiler, the
department spokeswoman, said the diplomat was detained for 10
minutes on Tuesday and was not accused of any specific infraction.
She and other officials declined to disclose the name of the
Romanian.
   Sources in Bucharest speculated that the Romanian was one of six
Communist Party veterans who had written a letter to Ceausescu
earlier in the year sharply critical of his policies.
   The letter called for more human rights at home, an immediate
halt to food exports and the revocation of plans to destroy
thousands of villages as part of a plan to create agricultural and
industrial centers.
   The signers included former Foreign Minister Corneliu Manescu
and Silviu Brucan, a former ambassador to Washington.
   Despite its hard-line domestic policies, Romania for years has
operated with considerable independence from Moscow in foreign
affairs. It does not permit Soviet troops on its territory and did
not support Soviet military intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968.
   Romania has maintained diplomatic relations with Israel and
permitted massive Jewish emigration for which it was rewarded with
special U.S. trade privileges. But Romania revoked its ``most
favored nation status'' last year in anticipation that Congress
would order a suspension because of Romania's domestic policies.

   A judge permitted soul singer James Brown,
who is serving a six-year prison term, to leave jail to sign
autographs at a courthouse, much to the dismay of corrections
officials.
   ``Somebody asked me if I could get him up here to get his
autograph and I said I would try,'' Circuit Judge Frank Eppes said
after Thursday's signing session.
   ``I was flabbergasted,'' said Parker Evatt, commissioner of the
Department of Corrections. ``What happened is totally irregular.''
   If prison officials had known Brown was to sign autographs, they
would not have allowed him to leave the prison, Evatt said. They
assumed the sheriff's department's request to release Brown briefly
was connected to court business.
   Brown, 55, was sentenced in December to six years in jail for
leading police on a two-state car chase from Augusta, Ga., to North
Augusta, S.C. He was convicted of aggravated assault and failure to
stop for an officer.
   At Eppes' request, a sheriff's department van on Thursday drove
the ``Godfather of Soul'' from the State Park Correctional Center,
north of Columbia, to the Richland County Courthouse in downtown
Columbia.
   Brown signed autographs at the courthouse for more than 40
people, including Eppes, and then returned to prison.
   Eppes said he saw no harm in the autograph session.

   First lady Barbara Bush says she has given her
son a bit of motherly advice: Stick to running the Texas Rangers
baseball team and don't run for governor of Texas.
   Mrs. Bush said Thursday she believes George W. Bush may take her
advice.
   ``I'm rather hoping he won't because everything that happens bad
with the administration is (going to be) young George's fault,''
Mrs. Bush said during a luncheon with eight reporters in the family
dining room of the White House.
   ``I'm hoping, having bought the Rangers, he'll get so involved
that he won't do it,'' she said. ``When you make a major commitment
like that ... I think maybe you won't be running for governor.''
   Bush conceded that his mother had expressed her opinion about
his possible bid for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in
1990, but said he is not sure he'll take the advice.
   ``For 42 years, she has given me her opinion,'' Bush said. ``I
have listened to it _ sometimes. I still love my mother, and I
appreciate her advice, but that's all it is, advice.''
   The first lady also said she is now a Rangers fan and plans to
throw out the first ball at a game May 4.

   All but two of crime writer Elmore Leonard's
27 books have been made into movies, but until now he has never
written about the nation's movie capital, Hollywood.
   But all that is soon to change, says the master of the suspense
novel.
   Leonard, who is promoting his current novel, ``Killshot,'' said
this week he is about 150 pages into a new book about a film
producer, and the setting will be Tinseltown, instead of his most
often used Detroit.
   ``I'm going to bring in my kind of guys, drop them into the
picture and see what happens,'' says the author of ``Glitz,''
``Freaky Deaky,'' ``Stick,'' ``Hombre'' and other best sellers.
   Leonard fans know that the guys in his hair-raising thrillers
are usually tough and violent Midwesterners on both sides of the
law.
   The story-in-progress involves a man with a dark background who
comes to Hollywood ``just to help a guy trying to get a picture
made,'' said Leonard.

kicking his cocaine habit here five years ago.
   Jennings said he no idea of ``the dangers'' when he first

kids, from taking the same path.
   ``I think education is the only hope,'' said Jennings. ``The war

<HEAD>Mayo Clinic Reports Success in Helping Smokers Quit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than three-quarters of people
trying to quit smoking were able to do so for six weeks with the
help of nicotine patches, researchers at the Mayo Clinic reported
Friday.
   In a preliminary study that started last fall, 24 of 31 people
who wore nicotine patches had stopped smoking, said Dr. Richard
Hurt, director of Mayo's Smoking Cessation Center and one of the
investigators.
   The silver-dollar-sized patches release nicotine slowly through
the skin into the bloodstream. A control group in the study wore
patches not treated with nicotine, and only 12 of 31 participants
quit smoking.
   Hurt cautioned that a long-term follow-up study is needed, but
said the patch could be a tool to help people stop smoking.
   Dr. John Pinney, executive director of the Institute for the
Study of Smoking Behavior and Policy at Harvard University, said
the results are consistent with other research on the patches.
   But he agreed with Hurt that a follow-up is important to assess
whether the quitters remain non-smokers after a year. ``The relapse
rate begins to accelerate from three to six months,'' Pinney said.
   The patch, similar to those used for dispensing medicine,
contains 30 milligrams of nicotine. About 1 milligram of nicotine
is absorbed through the skin every hour so smokers are better able
to handle the withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting smoking.
   The Mayo Clinic is one of four centers studying the patch for
possible Food and Drug Administration approval. The others are in
Maryland, New Jersey and Georgia.
   The 62 people who participated in Mayo's nicotine study were
randomly divided into two groups with 31 receiving nicotine patches
and 31 receiving placebo patches that looked identical but
contained no nicotine, Hurt said.
   All were monitored weekly by a nurse who checked carbon monoxide
levelsto confirm whether they had been smoking. After the six
weeks, 24 people with nicotine patches had quit smoking and 12 with
placebo patches had quit, Hurt said.
   Of those who still smoked, all who had nicotine patches and 15
of the 19 on placebo patches had reduced their smoking by more than
half.
   The people who wore the nicotine patches were, by chance,
significantly heavier smokers before the study, Hurt said. They
smoked a median of 30 cigarettes daily, compared with 25 smoked
daily by the placebo group.
   Both groups had smoked for about 20 years.
   Researchers will track the participants at three-month intervals
for a year to determine whether they continue without cigarettes.
   Hurt said research at the three other centers may show that
fewer people quit in both groups but there is still likely to be a
2 to 1 ratio of nicotine patch quitters to placebo patch quitters.
   The American Cancer Sociey estimates that cigarette smoking is
responsible for 83 percent of the cases of lung cancer. Smoking
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths.

   Five-year-old Eddy Hains surprised doctors when
he offered to donate his own heart if he dies, but his mother said
Friday she's used to the boy's courage as he waits for a heart-lung
transplant.
   ``It didn't really surprise me. I'm proud of him,'' said Terry
Hains in a telephone interview from Roseville, Minn., where she
awaits word from University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinics about
a transplant for Eddy.
   ``He actually thinks it's funny that he's still alive, really,''
she said. ``He says `I guess I fooled them.' He loves life and
loves people and I guess he's just not ready to go.''
   Eddy suffers from cystic fibrosis, a fatal genetic disease in
which lungs become clogged with mucus because of malfunctioning
gland secretions.
   The boy has been on a national donor list since March 1988 when
pneumonia weakened his lungs. Doctors say they want to do a
heart-lung transplant because it would reduce chances of his body
rejecting the lungs. His heart is healthy.
   On March 2, a donor was found. Eddy was prepared for the
transplant and was moments away from the operating room when
doctors determined the donor's lungs were too full of fluid.
   Mrs. Hains said before the transplant was canceled, doctors
asked Eddy if he realized that he might die during the operation
and the boy responded calmly, ``of course.''
   She said Eddy even surprised his doctors more by telling them he
wanted them to donate his heart should he die on the operating
table.
   ``You can't throw out a good heart,'' he told them. ``It's from
Wisconsin.'' The family's home is in Cudahy, a Milwaukee suburb,
but Mrs. Hains and Eddy have taken an apartment in Minnesota to be
near the hospital.
   Eddy has grown weaker this week, she said, but his enthusiasm
for life and his interest in the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team
hasn't waned.
   ``I tell him the Brewers win and he smiles,'' she said. ``He has
me wake him up (every night) to let him know what the score is.''
   Mrs. Hains and her husband, Edward, have three other children,
ages 11, 8 and 7. A bank in South Milwaukee is handling an account
for donations to the family to help with medical bills.

   Lightning struck a cemetery bell tower,
toppling part of the concrete structure onto a homeless man
sleeping inside and killing him, authorities said Friday.
   ``He never had a chance,'' Assistant Fire Chief Richard Dunn
said. ``It appears the first floor fell on him.''
   The victim was identified as Jay Oleson, 22, of Aurora.
   The accident happened late Wednesday or early Thursday at East
Lawn Cemetery, where Oleson had been watching the restoration of
the 60-year-old bell tower.
   Oleson was fascinated with the tower, which was to be finished
and rededicated on Memorial Day, said Clyde Brown, who was
restoring it. Brown, who had befriended Oleson, said he apparently
entered the tower late Wednesday.
   Searchers found Oleson's body Thursday night in the rubble.

   The government said Friday its chief economic
forecasting gauge took a 0.7 percent nose dive in March, marking
the first back-to-back declines in more than a year in a portent of
progressive weakening in the economy.
   Last month's drop in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,
which is designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months
into the future, followed a 0.3 percent dip in February and was the
biggest falloff since a 0.8 percent decline last July.
   Should the index point downward again for April, that would make
three declines in a row, the traditional signal of a forthcoming
recession.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
report was ``not bad news and shows some slowing of the economy
which is probably good.''
   ``Overall it shows the economy is still sound and moving on a
steady course,'' he said.
   Analysts said the performance of the index thus far is another
indication that the economy is losing steam and that the slowdown
will become more pronounced later this year.
   ``It's very clear we're going to have a very marked and
worrisome slowdown in the economy,'' said economist David Levy of
Levy Economic Forecasts in Chappaqua, N.Y.
   Whether the slowdown will deteriorate into a recession is ``a
neck-and-neck race at the moment,'' Levy said.
   But Fitzwater said that the declines ``probably are transitional
movements to a sustainable rate of economic growth without
accelerating inflation.''
   ``Despite declines in February and March, the average of the
leading indicators index for the first quarter is higher than the
average for the fourth quarter of 1988,'' he said.
   Using the three-month rule of thumb, the index correctly
forecast all eight recessions that have occurred since 1948, but it
also gave false signals of a downturn on five other occasions.
   Larry Moran of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic
Analysis said that in each of the five cases in which a recession
did not occur, the economy still experienced a significant slowdown
in growth.
   ``I don't see any real (recession) signal yet, but if we do get
another month or two of decline and if history repeats itself, we
would be looking for either a significant slowdown or a
recession,'' Moran said.
   The last time the index registered two straight declines was
when it fell for five straight months from September 1987 through
January 1988, the months surrounding the October stock market crash.
   While many analysts feared that the nation was headed for a
recession after the market collapse, the economy rebounded and the
record peacetime expansion is now in its seventh year.
   For the past year, the Federal Reserve has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus
control inflation. However, some analysts have expressed concern
that the anti-inflation campaign will prove too potent and stifle
the economic expansion.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu, speaking to a consumer
group Friday, said the administration doesn't want higher interest
rates that would ``scrunch down'' the economy.
   ``This economy is strong, it is robust, and it will continue to
thrive as long as we don't adopt policies to scrunch it down,''
Sununu said.
   ``If the Fed persists in slowing the economy, there is a very
real danger of throwing the economy into a recession,'' said
Lawrence Hunter, deputy chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. ``Putting people out of work is bad economic policy and
indefensible as a way to combat inflation.''
   Other analysts hold to the belief that the Fed will be able to
engineer a so-called ``soft landing,'' in which growth slows enough
to cool inflation without causing a recession.
   William Dunkelberg, dean of the business school at Temple
University, said the economy still is flying ``at a very high
altitude. We can bounce around some, but I don't think there is any
evidence yet that we're going to have a very serious decline.''
   Michael Moran, chief economist for Daiwa Securities America
Inc., said that while the economy is showing signs of slowing, ``I
don't think it's falling off a cliff.''
   ``We're moving from what was a robust pace of growth last year
to a moderate pace of growth this year,'' Moran said.
   In March, nine of the 11 indicators that make up the leading
index declined, with a drop in building permits counting as the
biggest negative factor.
   Other negatives included: a dip in manufacturers' orders for
consumer goods; a shorter average work week; an increase in initial
claims for jobless benefits; a drop in an index measuring consumer
confidence; faster vendor deliveries, signaling slower demand; a
contraction in the money supply; a decline in manufacturers'
unfilled orders and falling stock prices.
   Two indicators made positive contributions: a jump in prices for
raw materials, indicating stronger demand; and a gain in orders for
new plants and equipment.
   The various changes left the index at 144.4 percent of its 1982
base of 100. The index has advanced 0.5 percent over the past six
months, compared with a 2.1 percent rise over the previous
six-month period.

   Lucille Ball's family will gather to remember
her, but there will be no funeral, a spokesman said Friday.
   ``It isn't going to be a formal service, as such. What is going
on is totally private, with the family, and I don't know when or
where,'' said Tom Watson at Lucille Ball Enterprises.
   Miss Ball died unexpectedly of a burst aorta Wednesday, eight
days after emergency heart surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
She was 77.
   Her family said afterward through a spokesman there would be no
funeral for the red-haired comic actress, who starred with her
then-husband Desi Arnaz in the 1951-1957 ``I Love Lucy'' series
that revolutionized TV.
   Reports later said there would be a private funeral. But when
asked if such a service would take place, Watson said, ``Not in the
usual sense of the term, no.''
   ``It's carrying out Lucy's own wishes in this regard, and she
just wanted everything to be very quiet, with her own immediate
loved ones,'' Watson said. ``There's not going to be that kind of
formal service.''
   He had no information on burial plans.
   Miss Ball was being memorialized by fans who continued Friday to
call her offices to express their condolences.
   ``We have been inundated, as has almost every agency she has
been involved with. People who were only mildly connected to her,
along with fans from all over the world have been calling here,''
said Watson.
   Television stations around the country also planned or had
already offered ``I Love Lucy'' weekend marathons.
   An 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. commercial-free Lucy marathon is planned for
Saturday on KTTV, Channel 11 in Los Angeles.
   ``It's very much appreciated,'' said Watson. ``It's nice enough
to do it, but to do that and give up their advertising revenue for
10 hours, that's a wonderful, wonderful tribute on their part.''
   In New York, WNYW, Channel 5, ran two hours of classic ``I Love
Lucy'' episodes Wednesday. The Museum of Broadcasting has 60 hours
of Lucille Ball programming, and announced it will run a
mini-retrospective next week.
   On cable, the TNT network planned to run five Lucille Ball
theatrical films, while the Arts and Entertainment Network
scheduled a Friday broadcast of ``A Woman's Lot,'' a documentary
about the formation of Desilu studios overseen by Miss Ball.
   KRIV in Houston will broadcast a five-hour ``We'll Always Love
Lucy'' Sunday special.

<HEAD>Court Says Jean Harris Must Turn Over Book Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convicted murderer Jean Harris must turn over
$90,000 in profits from her autobiography to a state board that
dispenses cash to crime victims, a judge ruled.
   The Crime Victims Board argued successfully that under state
law, profits from the book, ``Stranger in Two Worlds,'' should
benefit survivors of Dr. Herman Tarnower, the man Mrs. Harris
killed.
   Mrs. Harris sought to donate the money to Children of Bedford
Inc., a fund for the children of inmates at the Bedford Hills
Correctional Facility, where she is serving a sentence of 15 years
to life for the March 1979 murder of the creator of the Scarsdale
diet.
   The prison charity argued in a lawsuit that garnishing the money
would violate Mrs. Harris's constitutional rights under the First
and 14th amendments. Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Israel
Rubin found otherwise, ruling Thursday in the board's favor.
   ``I think this ruling is very important in terms of the life of
the statute and the ability for victims to receive compensation,''
Catherine M. Abate, board chairwoman, said Friday.
   The money will be placed in escrow for up to five years. Under
the law, survivors of Tarnower must obtain a civil judgment in
order to obtain the money. If none comes forward, it will be
returned to Mrs. Harris.
   Mrs. Harris, 65, has written another book about her prison
experiences, ``They Always Call Us Ladies,'' which is not covered
by the state's so-called ``Son of Sam'' law because it does not
discuss the murder of Tarnower, her longtime lover.
   Seventy pages of ``Stranger in Two Worlds'' deal with Tarnower,
his death and her subsequent trial.

<TEXT>
   Episcopal parishioners are upset by a bishop's
directive forbidding the formal blessing of same-sex relationships,
a priest said Friday.
   ``The disappointment is that once again it seems that the church
just doesn't seem to be able to extricate itself from cultural
mores,'' said the Rev. Richard Valantasis, co-rector of St. John
the Evangelist Parish. He estimated that about one-third of the
congregation is homosexual.
   The Episcopal Church accepts homosexuals as members, but is
still studying the issues of ordination and blessing, said the Rev.
Bruce G.C. Bayne, chairman of a Massachusetts diocesan commission
on sexuality.
   ``The church's mind is not determined,'' he said.
   The blessing generally is used as a form of church recognition
of an outside marriage, such as a civil ceremony. St. John's clergy
proposed blessing the 15-year relationship of two women, but the
ceremony would have made no reference to marriage, Valantasis said.
   Some Episcopalians have trouble with the concept of endorsing
homosexual unions, said the Rev. Sam Abbott, of St. James's
Episcopal Church in Cambridge.
   ``The fear is that it's a very short step from blessing
relationships to being in a position of saying this is a same-sex
marriage,'' he said.
   Some Episcopal parishes have quietly been extending their
blessing to same-sex couples in Massachusetts for years, Valantasis
said, but in the case of St. John's, rectors proposed the blessing
take place during the sacrament of Eucharist and asked for official
approval.
   David E. Johnson, bishop of the 96,000-member Episcopal diocese
of Massachusetts, responded by letter dated April 20, saying the
blessing would be inappropriate.
   ``We feel that that's another way of being abusive to gay people
... by giving the appearance that nothing is happening,'' said
Valantasis.
   Johnson declined to comment Friday, said diocesan spokesman Jim
Solheim.
   Opponents to endorsing same-sex unions cite biblical passages
condemning homosexuality.
   ``I'm one of those who feels that the church ought to offer
support and concern and compassion to people of whatever lifestyle
but it does seem to me that we can't easily get around the teaching
of the scriptures which do not condone homosexual conduct,'' Abbott
said.
   But Valantasis responded, ``If we take all of those moral
injunctions, then we should also be condemning alcoholics.''
   Parishioner Margaret Miles said most of St. John's approximately
200 members were pleased when Valantasis and co-rector the Rev.
Jennifer Phillips said they were seeking authorization. ``The
congregation, as one person, as far as I could tell, got to their
feet and cheered, which is very unusual,'' she said.
   Miles, the Bussey professor of historical theology at Harvard
Divinity School, said news that the blessing had been stopped was
crushing.
   Valantasis said he and Phillips hope to discuss the issue
further with Johnson.
   ``I think that this is a very volatile issue and it comes to the
sort of heart of our cultural fabric,'' Valantasis said.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Soviet Union pulled the last
of its soldiers out of Afghanistan two months ago, 313 were left
behind, lost during the Red Army's nine-year involvement in the
civil war.
   Some were shot down and possibly killed. Some were captured by
Moslem guerrillas and held in prison camps in Afghanistan, Iran or
Pakistan. Others just wandered outside one day and vanished.
   Moscow has turned for help to the United States, which still is
trying to trace the 2,400 American servicemen who disappeared
during the Vietnam War.
   ``It's a problem that would cost the United States nothing to
help solve and would mean a great deal to us,'' said Yuli M.
Vorontsov, the Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan and first deputy
prime minister to President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``You Americans shouldn't have any trouble understanding why
this is so important to us,'' Vorontsov said.
   Vorontsov said the issue has been raised with the State
Department and the White House in hopes Washington will use its
influence as the guerrillas' principal weapons supplier.
   The State Department says the issue is a ``matter of
humanitarian concern,'' and it has urged the Soviets and guerrilla
representatives to reach an agreement for the exchange of POWs.
   ``We have discussed the exchange of POWs with representatives of
the Afghan resistance. We have conveyed to the resistance and to
the Soviets our position that there should be no involuntary
repatriation of POWs,'' said a department official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Vorontsov said his country has given the names of 313 missing
soldiers to the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   ``We don't expect all of them to be alive,'' he said. ``We just
want to know what happened to them.''
   The Red Cross is allowed to visit POW camps in Afghanistan and
Pakistan, which serves as the base for the guerrillas waging an
11-year-old war with Afghanistan's Communist government.
   Red Cross officials refuse to disclose any details about their
visits, including prisoners' identifies and conditions.
   They say it is difficult to say how many prisoners are held by
the Moslem guerrillas.
   ``There are tens, maybe hundreds of groups fighting, and their
connection is quite loose,'' said one Red Cross official.
   ``Some (prisoners) are released, others are exchanged,
transferred from one rebel group to another, or executed,'' the
worker said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   According to rebel sources in Pakistan, four Soviet POWs were
traded recently for 100 guerrillas in one of Afghanistan's northern
provinces. There was no independent confirmation.
   The rebel sources say it is unlikely there are more than 75
Soviet prisoners _ if that many _ alive in Afghanistan.
   And despite what the guerrillas call good will gestures, they
have said they want to keep their prisoners as bargaining chips
should they capture the capital of Kabul.
   ``They always have an excuse,'' Vorontsov said. ``First they
didn't want to talk until the Soviet troops were gone. Now that
they are, they say they'll only talk when there's a full
settlement.''
   On Feb. 15, under a U.N.-sponsored accord, the Soviet Union
pulled out the last of its troops, ending a military involvement
that began in December 1979. The communists had come to power in an
April 1978 coup that led to the guerrilla insurgency.

<HEAD>Party Readmits Chronicler of Stalin's Crimes After 20 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party has readmitted Roy A.
Medvedev, a historian whose expose of the bloody dictatorial rule
of Josef Stalin prompted his expulsion 20 years ago, Tass said
Friday.
   Medvedev, 63, said he reacted ``positively'' to the news. Asked
in an interview if he attributed his restoration to President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms, he responded: ``I didn't change my
views. A turnabout occurred in the party, the Central Committee.
They stopped discriminating against me. I have been published
here.''
   Tass said Medvedev had asked the Central Committee's Party
Control Committee to be restored as a party member, and the request
was approved. But Medvedev told The Associated Press he had not
made any request. He said party officials approached him several
months ago and asked if he wanted to become a member again. ``They
asked me how I would react, and I said I would not object.''
   Medvedev said he never considered asking to be restored as a
party member during the rule of President Leonid I. Brezhnev
because, ``That was another epoch.'' Brezhnev died in 1982.
   Like many Soviets who had fallen out of official favor for what
once was considered dissent, Medvedev has gradually been restored
to good graces. He has appeared at officially sponsored news
conferences, been quoted frequently in the official press and was
elected April 9 as a deputy to the new Soviet parliament, the
Congress of People's Deputies.
   Tass said it was Medvedev's book about Stalin's crimes, ``Let
History Judge,'' that prompted his expulsion from the party in
1969, but that the control committee determined that action was
``unfounded'' and restored his membership.
   Medvedev has said ``Let History Judge,'' which he started
writing in 1962, was ``the main work of my life.'' Seeing a
possibility that Stalin would be restored posthumously to official
good graces despite his crimes, Medvedev decided to have the book
published abroad. It came out in the United States and several
other countries in 1971.
   But it wasn't until this year that it appeared in the Soviet
Union. The literary journal Znamya published the first part of
``Let History Judge'' in its January issue.
   The Soviet Union's Progress Publishers is to put out the entire
book, an indictment of Stalin's dictatorial rule.
   Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, it is no
longer considered dissent to condemn Stalin or report his crimes.
In fact, the Soviet press is full of articles about Stalin's
personality cult.
   Medvedev has estimated that 40 million Soviets were either
killed, arrested or otherwise repressed under Stalin, and his
figure _ along with other of his remarks about Stalin _ have
appeared in the Soviet press.
   He believes _ as does Gorbachev _ that the Soviet Union can move
toward a democratic political system without abandoning fundamental
tenets of Marxism-Leninism.
   Medvedev and his brother, Zhores, were among the first prominent
members of what evolved into the Soviet dissident movement. Zhores
Medvedev, a biochemist and gerontologist, was placed in a
psychiatric hospital before he was forced to leave the Soviet Union
for London in 1973.
   Human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov has said Medvedev was
an important influence on him, even though they later separated.
   After his expulsion from the party, authorities tolerated
Medvedev, and he became a valuable, unofficial source for
journalists seeking information about Soviet history and politics.

   Somebody give this man a medal.
   No, not Oliver North _ Mike Robe, the producer, writer and
director of the CBS movie ``Guts &amp; Glory: The Rise and Fall of
Oliver North.''
   For a film hurriedly made and rushed onto the air in time for
the important May rating period and the expected conclusion of
North's trial, it is surprisingly good. It airs in two parts,
Sunday and Tuesday.
   The crisply written script is based on Benjamin Bradlee Jr.'s
book of the same name. But Robe adds another dimension to the
``docudrama,'' turning it into his own statement on the Iran-Contra
affair: he has added a fictional character, a White House aide who
serves as the film's conscience _ since nobody apparently fulfilled
such a role in real life.
   Aaron Sykes, played by Terry O'Quinn, turns up in part one of
the movie as a mentor to North when the Marine colonel joins the
National Security Council. Sykes even suggests gently to North at
one point that some things, such as his children, are more
important than fighting Communists.
   Later in the movie, after the news of the Iran-Contra scandal
has broken, Sykes confronts North, arguing that the operation was
an attack on American democracy, not the grand, heroic gesture
North believed it to be. ``How many hostages are back?'' Sykes
demands. ``For all those missiles you sold to the same damn people
who blew up barracks and murdered 241 American boys? Shame on us!''
   North argues, ``We tried the only thing we thought would work''
to free the hostages, and insists that, in the case of arms to the
Nicaraguan Contras, ``we're fighting for democracy down there.''
   ``By keeping it from democracy here! Sell that somewhere else,
Colonel,'' Sykes retorts.
   By the end of the film, when North is faced with charges and
colleagues are running for cover, Sykes again confronts him: ``What
you guys tried to pull,'' he says, ``was nothing short of a secret
government, the most dangerous threat to my country I can
imagine.'' North sticks to his guns. As a Marine, he says, he
fights ``any way I can.''
   The appearance of Sykes does not turn ``Guts &amp; Glory'' into an
anti-Oliver North movie, largely due to the strength and guts of
David Keith's portrayal of the colonel. Keith has said in
interviews that he is a big fan of the real North.
   Annette O'Toole does justice to Betsy North, here portrayed as a
sympathetic, three-dimensional character, not the paperdoll cutout
of a housewife that would have been easier. Amy Stock-Poynton plays
Fawn Hall as an earnest defender of the cause.
   There are good performances all around, especially Barnard
Hughes as CIA Director William Casey, Paul Dooley as National
Security Adviser Bud McFarlane and Peter Boyle as Admiral John
Poindexter. Bryan Clark does a credible impersonation of President
Reagan.
   As if to counterbalance the creation of Sykes, Robe includes
another, if not fictional, then at least questionable episode. At
the beginning of part two of the movie, North is shown piloting a
plane over El Salvador, landing it under enemy fire and rescuing
Salvadoran soldiers. The story has been told but not substantiated.
Bradlee included it in his book with a note that it might not be
true.
   Even if it isn't true, it makes for a good movie _ not unlike
North himself.

   Fourteen British soccer fans were
convicted of involuntary manslaughter today and sentenced to three
years in prison for their roles in a 1985 riot that killed 39
people at Heysel Stadium.
   The fans, all from Liverpool, also were fined $1,538 each.
Eleven fans were acquitted.
   The three-judge panel that handed down the verdicts suspended
half of each prison sentence. Afterward, the 14 convicted fans left
Belgium. They have 15 days to appeal their sentence.
   The 14 have already served six months in pre-trial custody,
which means they probably would serve no more than a few months
behind bars. In Belgium, convicts generally serve a third of their
sentence.
   After the May 29, 1985, disaster, English soccer clubs, such as
Liverpool and Manchester United, were banned from European
competition. The ban did not affect England's national teams, which
still can compete for the European Cup and the World Cup.
   The verdicts came in the wake of Britain's worst sports
disaster. On April 15, 95 people were killed in a stadium stampede
when fans tried to crowd into a standing-room-only section during a
match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in Sheffield, England.
   Albert Roosens, the former Belgian Soccer Federation chairman,
was given a six-month suspended sentence for negligence and poor
organization of the Heysel soccer match.
   A senior police officer, Johan Mahieu, received a nine-month
suspended sentence for grave omissions of duty. Belgian police
officer Michael Kensier was acquitted.
   In a separate civil action brought by family members and heard
by the same judicial panel that heard the criminal case, four
officials were found not liable for the deaths that resulted from
the tragedy.
   They included Jacques Georges, president of European Union of
Football Associations, Europe's ruling soccer body; former
organization General Secetary Hans Bangerter; Brussels Mayor Herve
Brouhon; and Viviane Baro, a former Brussels alderman for sports.
   ``I wish wholeheartedly we will never have to face court again
and that soccer will only bring family entertainment from now on,''
Georges said.
   In addition to the 39 deaths, more than 500 people were injured
when Liverpool fans rioted at Belgium's Heysel Stadium just prior
to 1985 European soccer championship final between Liverpool and
Juventus Turin of Italy.
   Eighteen days earlier, 56 soccer fans had died in a fire at
England's Bradford stadium.
   Belgian authorities had requested the extradition of 27 Britons
based on videotapes and pictures showing British fans tearing down
the flimsy fence separating them from Italian supporters. Two
already were being held in British jails on unrelated charges,
bringing the number extradited to 25.
   The invasion of the stands caused a panic during which victims
were trampled to death as they tried to flee. Most of the victims
were Italian.
   Britain complied with the extradition request in September 1987,
and the five-month trial began Oct. 17, 1988. Closing arguments
ended March 20.
   Sir Harry Livermore, one of the defense lawyers, said an appeal
was likely.
   ``The acquittals are OK, but I am disappointed they've handed
out custodial sentences to the others,'' he said. ``I don't think
they would have to serve more than between 10 and 12 months. But I
was hoping the whole of their sentences would be suspended.''
   Prosecutor Pierre Erauw said he saw no need to keep the 14
convicted fans behind bars pending appeal.
   ``I thought there was no need as most of them came to (Friday's)
hearing,'' he told reporters, adding that unless an appeal is
filed, the 14 ``will receive an invitation to come to prison.''

<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. and South African officials
disagree about how many nationalist guerrillas remain in Namibia
despite orders to withdraw, a South African diplomat said Friday.
   Neil van Heerden, director-general of the Foreign Affairs
Department, said South Africa believes 400 guerrillas still are in
Namibia, while officials of the U.N. monitoring force put the
figure at 200.
   Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the U.N. monitoring
force in Namibia, said only that ``substantial numbers'' of
guerrillas have left northern Namibia since Wednesday.
   South Africa has suggested the timetable for the entire U.N.
peace plan could be affected if it cannot verify that all
guerrillas have withdrawn after an ill-fated incursion that
threatened to derail Namibia's transition to independence.
   Van Heerden said between 850 and 1,000 guerrillas of the
South-West Africa Peope's Organization have returned to Angola on
orders of their exiled leaders. South Africa, which has agreed to
end its 74-year rule over Namibia, says about 1,600 guerrillas
infiltrated from Angola starting April 1, and that 305 guerrillas
and 27 security forces were killed in fighting after that.
   Under a regional peace plan signed last year by South Africa,
Angola and Cuba, the guerrillas were to remain at thir bases in
Angola until mid-May, when they were to return unarmed. The
guerrilla organization is not a signatory to the agreement and
denies it violated the accord.
   To encourage the guerrillas' withdrawal, South Africa has
confined its forces in northern Namibia to their bases for a
60-hour period ending at dawn Saturday.
   South African, Angolan and Cuban negotiators, meeting in Cape
Town with U.S. and Soviet observers, agreed Friday to a 14-day
verification period starting Saturday. During this period, South
African and U.N. officials will try to confirm that all SWAPO
guerrillas have moved at least 100 miles inside Angola.
   If a full SWAPO pullout is verified, van Heerden said, South
African forces will return to their bases May 13 and efforts will
be made to resume the transition without delays to a U.N. timetable
calling for elections in November.
   A SWAPO statement Thursday said 1,337 guerrillas had
``redeployed'' from Namibia to Angola. It did not specify the
period during which the withdrawal occurred, nor say how many
guerrillas remain in Namibia.
   SWAPO said its guerrillas ``have been running the gauntlet of
South Africa troops' ambushes.''
   All guerrillas in Namibia soon will move to Angola, provided
security forces ``do not impede their way,'' it said.
   The independence plan is part of an agreement that also calls
for Cuba to withdraw 50,000 troops from Angola, where they have
supported the Marxist government's fight against right-wing rebels
backed by the United States and South Africa.

   A football game between Illinois and Southern
California universities will take place Sept. 2 in Moscow in the
first such match in the Soviet Union, Tass said Friday.
   A contract was signed Thursday between the U.S. sponsor and the
Soviet economic group Sovintersport to pave the way for the
historic match dubbed ``Glasnost Cup,'' the official news agency
said.
   The game, from Moscow's Dynamo Stadium, will be televised live
in the United States by ABC-TV.
   About 3,000 American fans are expected to fly to Moscow for the
game, Tass said.
   ``Undoubtedly, such activity will be good publicity for our
company,'' Tass quoted Kenneth Haines, a representative of the
sponsoring firm Raycom, as saying. ``To bring so many Americans and
to present their favorite sport, is it not a step toward mutual
understanding?''
   Raycom, which arranges telecasts of sports events in the United
States, will provide Soviet TV with videotapes of American football
games to help Soviets understand the game, Haines told Tass.

   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu warned
on Friday that higher interest rates could ``scrunch down'' the
economy.
   ``It is a consumer issue to be worried about interest rates,''
as well as tax increases and international trade, Sununu told a
luncheon of Consumer Alert, a conservative group he once headed.
   Sununu claimed for the Bush administration the achievement of
keeping the economic recovery going, saying: ``This economy is
strong, it is robust, and it will continue to thrive as long as we
don't adopt policies to scrunch it down.''
   ``Those policies,'' he added, ``include interest rates. Those of
you who are wise consumers understand that when you go to buy a car
or a house or anything that requires you as a consumer to pay over
a long period of time, one of the most critical aspects of whether
or not it's a good deal for you is the rate of interest you will
have to pay on the purchase.''
   President Bush has said that he does not want the Federal
Reserve Board, an independent body, to concentrate so hard on
fighting inflation that it tips the economy into a recession.
   The Fed has strong influence over interest rates through its
control of the money supply, largely exercised through purchases
and sales of government bonds, through rates it charges for use of
its funds, and through other regulations.
   Fed credit policies are made public only with a time lag. The
policy-making Open Market Committee decided in February not to
increase rates further for the moment, but two weeks after that
meeting the Fed raised by one-half percentage point to 7 percent
the rate it charges member banks for funds.
   The most recent figures show the economy expanding at an annual
rate of 3 percent during the first three months of the year, and
inflation as measured by consumer prices increasing at an annual
rate of 6.1 percent during the first quarter, the highest rate in
two years.
   Sununu said the budget agreement with Congress would bring a
deficit reduction of $65 billion to $75 billion, and economic
growth if it continues at the current rate would add $85 billion a
year to federal revenue next year and the year after without new
taxes.
   ``Compare that to what alternatives that are being proposed. One
of the alternatives is a gasoline tax (increase),'' he said.
   ``I think you all remember what happened when we had significant
increases in gasoline prices in the late '70s. Our economy was
stifled. ... If you want to match what you can get out of growth
with a gasoline tax that would inhibit growth, you would have to be
looking at an 85-cent per gallon increase.
   ``I can't imagine anyone advocating such a policy and getting
away with being called a consumerist, and yet there are those who
are trying to do that.'' He did not say who he had in mind.
   ``As a consumer you certainly worry about having competitive
products in the market, and it is a consumer issue to have a strong
commitment to free trade that allows competitive products to come
in here,'' Sununu said.
   ``And I think one of the most difficult consumer issues to deal
with emotionally is the trade issue. Because sometimes the first
reaction, the emotional reaction of exclusion, is not one in the
best interests of consumer or the country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report Suggests Arrangements May Help Drive Up Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report on Friday suggested that
financial arrangements between physicians and health care
businesses to which they refer Medicare patients may be helping to
drive up costs in the federal health insurance program.
   The report to Congress by the Department of Health and Human
Services' inspector general found that one in seven Medicare
physicians has a financial interest in a health care business to
which they refer their patients.
   It also found that patients of these physicians receive far more
laboratory and other services than patients of physicians who have
no financial arrangements with health care businesses.
   The report by Inspector General Richard Kusserow stopped short
of saying that financial arrangements between physicians and
laboratories and other health-related businesses lead to
unnecessary testing and higher Medicare costs.
   ``While we have demonstrated an association rather than a
causality, this finding ... is quite troubling,'' the report said.
   Kusserow recommends that the Health Care Financing
Administration, the HHS agency that oversees Medicare, require
health-care providers billing the program to disclose the names of
their physician owners and investors to the program. He also
recommends that all claims submitted for Medicare payment contain
the names of referring physicians.
   HHS is developing regulations that would limit
referring-physicians' financial involvement in laboratories or
clinics, and a bill introduced in Congress would generally prohibit
physicians from referring Medicare patients to health care
businesses in which they hold a financial interest.
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., who introduced the legislation, said
Friday in a statement that ``Medicare, patients, and the taxpayer
are paying tens of millons of dollars for needless tests, caused by
doctors referring patients to centers from which the doctor makes a
profit because of the referral.''
   ``If we do not stop this practice, and if it continues to
spread, the added cost to Medicare and the American health care
system will be billions of dollars per year,'' Stark said.
   While many joint venture arrangements in the health-care
industry are legitimate, Kusserow's office is distributing 1.2
million copies of a fraud alert to the nation's health care
providers warning that certain arrangements violate the Medicare
and Medicaid anti-kickback law.
   The report found that about 15 percent of physicians who bill
Medicare have an ownership, investment or compensation arrangement
with health care businesses to which they refer patients.
   It estimated that 12 percent of physicians who bill Medicare
have ownership or investment interests in health care businesses,
including testing laboratories, to which they refer patients. Eight
percent of Medicare physicians have compensation arrangements with
such businesses, including space rental and consulting agreements
and management services contracts. Discounting the overlap between
the two groups, about 15 percent have at least one or both types of
financial interest.
   Also, at least 25 percent of independent clinical laboratories
and 27 percent of independent physiological laboratories are owned
wholly or partly by referring physicians, the report found.
   In addition, the report said that patients referred by
physicians who own or invest in clinical laboratories received 45
percent more clinical lab services than all Medicare patients in
general, regardless of where they received the services. This
increased use of services cost the Medicare program $28 million in
1987, the report said.
   ``Certainly the utilization effect we have seen in the
laboratory industries is cause for concern to the Medicare
program,'' the report said.
   The inspector general's office compiled its findings through
surveys of about 3,680 physicians and 1,132 health care businesses
as well as interviews with industry representatives and health care
experts.

<HEAD>Rare Ancient Fish Fossils Stolen From Bradley University</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two priceless fish fossils, estimated to be
300 million years old, are missing from a Bradley University
display case and officials said Friday they may have been stolen
for a private collector.
   Merrill Foster, chairman of the geological sciences department
at Bradley, said he discovered the theft Tuesday. Police are
investigating.
   ``We use them for educational purposes so we don't want to keep
them locked away in a vault,'' Foster said.
   Stolen were the remains of a ``jawless fish'' related to the
lamprey family, and the remains of a bony, ray-finned fish. The two
fossils were imbedded on four small pieces of rock.
   Foster said they were the rarest and most valuable specimens in
Bradley's collection, which numbers in the hundreds of thousands of
fossils.
   Jawless fish were prehistoric ancestors of contemporary fish and
are thought to have evolved from sand-dwelling filter feeders about
450 million years ago, Foster said. A similar jawless fish fossil
was stolen from the Chicago Field Museum about 10 years ago, he
said.
   Foster said the Bradley theft appeared to be the work of experts
who pried open a jewelry-type glass display case.
   ``This was not your normal snatch thief,'' he said. ``To the
average thief in Peoria, these fossils are worthless. These were
stolen by someone who really knows fossils well.''
   Dave Reinertsen, senior staff geologist for the Illinois State
Geological Survey, said collectors often buy and sell fossils
through ads in mineral supply catalogs.
   ``There's a market for it,'' Reinertsen said. ``But if it's that
rare, I suspect (it) was snagged for a private collection.''

<HEAD>Fourteen Convicted in Soccer Riot That Killed 39</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court convicted 14 English soccer
fans of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced them to three years
in jail Friday for taking part in the 1985 Heysel Stadium riot that
killed 39 spectators.
   Eleven other fans were acquitted. A Belgian police officer and
the former head of the Belgian soccer federation were convicted of
charges stemming from the tragedy but received suspended sentences.
   The soccer disaster, in which fans from Liverpool were blamed
for the deaths of mainly Italian fans, led to a ban on England's
private soccer clubs in European competition. England's national
clubs were allowed to continue playing.
   Judge Pierre Verlynde, a member of the three-judge panel that
rendered the verdicts, said the Liverpool fans ``transformed the
field into a battleground'' and were ``thirsty for violence.''
   The verdicts came in the wake of Britain's worst sports
disaster. On April 15, 95 people were killed in a stadium stampede
when fans tried to crowd into a standing-room only section during a
match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in Sheffield, England.
   ``It's just been a mess,'' Alan Woodray, one of the 14 convicted
Liverpool fans, said after Friday's verdict. ``I'm not looking
forward to going to prison, but I'll be all right.''
   The court suspended 1{ years of each three-year sentence. Public
Prosecutor Pierre Erauw did not order arrests after the verdicts
were issued, and many of the convicted fans returned to England
after the eight-hour hearing.
   ``They will receive an invitation to come to prison. If they say
`no,' we may have to bring them here one way or the other,'' he
said.
   The 14 fans also were fined $1,538 each. Verlynde said the 11
other Liverpool fans were acquitted because of insufficient
evidence.
   Convicted of negligence in the disaster was Albert Roosens,
former chairman of the Belgian soccer federation. His six-month
sentence was suspended.
   Brussels police officer Johan Mahieu was convicted of gross
omission of duty and his sentence, for nine months, also was
suspended. Belgian police officer Michael Kensier was acquitted.
   In a separate civil action brought by family members and heard
by the same judicial panel that heard the criminal case, four
officials were found not liable for the deaths that resulted from
the tragedy.
   They included Jacques Georges, president of European Union of
Football Associations, Europe's ruling soccer body; former
organization General Secetary Hans Bangerter; Brussels Mayor Herve
Brouhon; and Viviane Baro, a former Brussels alderman for sports.
   Damages ranging from $900 to several thousand dollars were
awarded to individual plaintiffs in the civil action, and judges
said there somehow would be provisions made for those convicted in
the criminal actions to compensate the successful plaintiffs in the
civil action.
   In addition to the 39 deaths, more than 500 people were injured
when Liverpool fans rioted at Belgium's Heysel Stadium just prior
to 1985 European soccer championship final between Liverpool and
Juventus Turin of Italy.
   Eighteen days earlier, 56 soccer fans had died in a fire at
England's Bradford stadium.
   Belgian authorities had requested the extradition of 27 Britons
based on videotapes and pictures showing British fans tearing down
the flimsy fence separating them from Italian supporters. Two of
the Britons already were jailed on unrelated charges, bringing the
number extradited to 25.
   The invasion of the stands caused a panic during which victims
were trampled to death as they tried to flee.
   Britain complied with the extradition request in September 1987,
and the five-month trial began Oct. 17, 1988. Closing arguments
ended March 20.
   British defense lawyer Harry Livermore said Belgian authorities
may have to go through a second extradition process because
authorities allowed the Liverpool fans to leave the country.
   Livermore said he expects those convicted to serve less than a
year in jail. All the English defendants already served about six
months in custody following their extraditions but were freed on
their own recognizance prior to the trial.
   After the Heysel riots, English club teams were banned from
European competition by European Union of Football Associations.
The organization announced last month it would lift the ban in time
for the 1990-91 season provided English fans behaved at home until
then.

   A 5-year-old girl whose hand was mutilated
in a pipe bomb explosion at a K mart store last week was glad to be
home Friday and the family was anxious to ``get on with our lives.''
   ``She's doing very well,'' Maureen Bower said shortly after her
daughter, Erin, was released from Methodist Hospital. ``She wants
to be home. She was getting restless.''
   Erin was injured April 17 when a pipe bomb concealed in a
pump-style toothpaste container exploded as she picked it up off
the store's shelf.
   Surgeons could not salvage her maimed left hand, which was
amputated the day after the explosion. On Tuesday, the lens was
removed from the child's left eye, which also was hit in the blast.
Doctors hope some sight will be regained in the eye.
   ``I'm just glad we have our little girl,'' Mrs. Bower said.
``She doesn't have a hand, but she's ours and she's got her same
personality back. She's going to be fine. I've just got to keep
telling myself that. We've got to get on with our lives.''
   Erin was expected to spend the week resting at home before
returning to her kindergarten classes.
   Meanwhile, more than 20 investigators working on the case
continued to track down leads.
   In Terre Haute, two men matching the descriptions of those
sought for questioning were interviewed by the FBI and the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The two were released
later after questioning.
   Charles A. Petersen, agent in charge of the Indianapolis ATF
bureau, said the two were not suspects.
   ``We're just continuing the investigation in our normal
manner,'' said Petersen. ``We're just out hitting the pavement,
following up what leads we have and trying to find new ones.''

   The Oliver North trial jury began its second
week of deliberations Friday, yielding no signal on its progress:
no notes, no words to the judge and no requests for clarifications
or to rehear testimony.
   After working for five hours _ for a total 37{ since
deliberations started _ the jurors told a U.S. marshal they
intended to come in Saturday for a half-day session, the same as
last week.
   The jurors' weekday schedule has not varied. It begins with
their arrival from a downtown hotel at 8:20 a.m., then juice and
pastry and a 9 a.m. start. At noon a caterer arrives with lunches
chosen individually by each juror from a menu.
   On Friday, the order got mixed up _ the caterer delivered the
wrong lunches _ and the jurors went back to work until 12:30 when
the right food arrived.
   North took advantage of the jury's 9-to-4 pace on Thursday with
a quick trip to deliver a speech to the Bankers Club of Cincinnati,
presumably for the same $20,000-$25,000 fee he has received for
other recent appearances.
   The former National Security Council aide spoke about
traditional values and received a standing ovation, according to
Bankers Club members who heard his speech.
   Steven Doherty, an Ohio State University sophomore from
Cincinnati, said North spoke highly of former President Reagan, the
club's next scheduled guest, booked for September.
   Protesters picketed outside the club before the speech.
   ``We don't care whether North sees us or not,'' said Roy Silver,
organizer for the Central American Task Force. ``We're
demonstrating against the Bankers (Club) for giving him $25,000
while there are homeless people in this city sleeping on the
streets.''
   The Bankers Club did not disclose North's fee.
   ``You're all a bunch of pro-communists'' shouted a well-dressed
businessman at the demonstrators.
   The North jury has before it 12 criminal charges, most of which
accuse North of lying or withholding information about his and the
NSC's support for the guerrillas fighting the leftist Nicaraguan
government.
   North is accused of lying to Congress to cover up his role in
secretly assisting the Contras and lying to the attorney general
about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from the
Iran arms sales. He also faces charges that he accepted a $13,800
home security system and converted $4,300 in traveler's checks from
a Contra leader to his own use.
   Meanwhile, a two-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals
rejected a petition by 10 news organizations for access to a
stipulation presented to the jury at the end of the trial, but not
made available to the public.
   The appeals court sent the issue back to U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell for a hearing on national security issues
involved, saying it cannot make a decision without having such a
record.
   The stipulation summarizes highly secret intelligence intercepts
about a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran that was
assisted by the CIA. North's lawyers referred in closing arguments
to the stipulation in an effort to show that knowledge about the
operatiion was not limited to North but was known widely among top
U.S. officials.

<HEAD>Pope Visits Madagascar Amid Truce; Says Ready to Meet Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT WELLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II said Friday at
the start of an African tour that he would welcome a meeting with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev when the Soviet leader visits Italy in
November.
   It would be the first meeting betweeen a pope and a Soviet
Communist party chief.
   But the pope said obstacles block a first papal visit to the
Soviet Union, including the repression of Ukrainian Catholics who
form the largest underground church in that country.
   John Paul was speaking to reporters on his way to Madagascar,
where he kissed the earth of this divided island nation on his
arrival amid a ``papal truce'' called after six days of
anti-government riots claimed six lives.
   Standing together on the runway to greet him were President
Didier Ratsiraka and Archibishop Victor Razafimahatratra, whose
clergy includes strident critics of the Madagascan leader.
   But the pope saved his displeasure for the problem of the
Ukrainian Catholic Church, brutally suppressed in 1946 when
dictator Josef Stalin ordered it absorbed into the Russian Orthodox
Church. Today Ukrainian Catholics make up the largest underground
church in the Soviet Union.
   ``This is really a very difficult problem,'' the pope said of
the issue still being discussed with Soviet Orthodox Church leaders.
   John Paul often has expressed a desire to visit his flock in the
Soviet Union, and some church officials hope a meeting with
Gorbachev could pave the way for it.
   ``Naturally I am always willing to receive who ever asks for a
meeting with me,'' the pope said in Italian. ``I would meet him
(Gorbachev) with great respect as the head of state, the head of a
system.
   ``Then, as far as this could be linked to the visit to the
Soviet Union, that is something else because that is a church
matter.''
   On his arrival in Madagascar, the pope noted the severe economic
difficulties facing the island as they do most African nations.
   ``The bishops of this country are working with all their
brothers, with determination, for national recovery,'' he said.
   Madagascar is the first stop on a trip that also is to take the
pope to the French Indian Ocean island of Reunion, and to Zambia
and Malawi.
   Like many African countries, Ratsiraka has abandoned socialist
policies to gain Western aid and improve a moribund economy. At the
same time he has moved to mend fences with the church.
   In his welcoming remarks, the Madagascan leader wasted no time
trying to turn the visit to political advantage and accused his
opponents of ``anarchy and political bad faith.''
   Opposition parties, which claim electoral fraud in the March 12
presidential elections, urged a pause in the street violence, and
the Federation of Madagascar Churches, which supports the
opposition fraud claims, also appealed for tranquility during the
papal visit.
   The Roman Catholic Church is a member of the church group and
some of its clergy may be victims of retaliation for their
outspoken criticism of Ratsiraka's government.
   ``In 1988, four separate murders of clergymen again raised
speculation that the Catholic Church, whose officials often speak
out on controversial issues, is being targeted by unknown political
groups to silence church criticism,'' says the State Department's
report on human rights in Madagascar.
   Opposition forces accuse the government of rigging the election
which Ratsiraka won by 63 percent of the vote. However, Western
diplomats say the irregularities likely did not significantly
affect the outcome.
   The opposition called for a national strike which failed to
materialize, but riots erupted in the capital, killing at least six
and injuring more than 70 in the past week.
   Ratsiraka's party and the opposition have accused each other of
instigating the riots in this former French colony where about 40
percent of the population is Christian and the rest animist. Half
the Christians are Roman Catholic.

<HEAD>Former Administrator Calls Investigative Report Misleading</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former administrator of a federal housing
program faulted for mismanagement and favoritism defended his
actions Friday and said an agency investigative report was
misleading.
   Thomas T. Demery, former assistant secretary of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development and former federal housing
commissioner, acknowledged documentation was lacking from the
process that awarded HUD contracts for rehabilitation of low-income
housing projects.
   But Demery said no favoritism was used to select winners, and
that he and then-Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. instituted more
formal and documented procedures for awarding contracts beginning
this year, shortly before both left the department.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, meanwhile, told a group of state
legislators Friday that the program ``was being abused by
consultants and some folks who were making a phone call and getting
a federal grant.''
   Kemp shut down the program temporarily this week following
release of an investigative report by the HUD inspector general and
blocked some $100 million in pending contracts, subject to a new
review of the program.
   The report charged no criminal activity, but the HUD inspector
general turned it over to the Justice Department for review.
   The report described how former Reagan administration figures,
including former top HUD officials, and other Republicans collected
big fees as consultants and in some cases became developers on
projects to rehabilitate subsidized apartments for the poor.
   Kemp said the report showed the program's selections were
``based on the perception and reality of favoritism and abuse of
non-public information.''
   Demery, in a telephone interview, said the large number of
former HUD officials revealed to be involved in projects as
developers or consultants after leaving government could be
explained because they had developed special knowledge in a narrow,
highly technical program.
   ``If they won those contracts, it wasn't because of inside
information,'' Demery said.
   Demery handled applications for contracts under the program and
was a member of a three-person selection committee that awarded
winning projects.
   The investigative report by HUD Inspector General Paul Adams
questioned the role of Demery, who was responsible for the program
beginning in October 1986. It said a non-profit charity, FOOD for
Africa, which Demery headed before joining HUD, received $290,000
from individuals and firms involved with HUD programs administered
by Demery.
   Demery said there was no connection between the charity and his
administration of the program. He said $50,000 of the contributions
came before he assumed responsibility for the program. And he
charged the inspector general had included contributions from
people and companies involved in HUD programs other than the
renovation program.
   ``It is a totally inappropriate presentation of facts,'' Demery
said. ``It's unconscionable the way he's tried to mix apples and
oranges and call them something else. ... What's the point except
to mislead?''
   Adams declined to respond to Demery's comments. ``The report
speaks for itself,'' Adams said.
   Pierce, HUD secretary throughout the Reagan administration, did
not return a reporter's call.

<HEAD>Trade Magazine Says Stealth Fighter Flying During Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force, which last November
acknowledged that it had been flying the stealth fighter at night
for five years, has started operating the F-117A jets during the
day, said a report published Friday.
   Aviation Week and Space Technology reported in its May 1 edition
that over the past two weeks, as many as 20 stealth fighters have
been spotted over Mojave, Calif., near Edwards Air Force Base.
   The weekly magazine published a grainy color photograph of an
airborne F-117A, but it was far less detailed than a picture
released by the Air Force last November when it acknowledged the
existence of the airplane for the first time.
   More than 50 of the swept-wing twin engine warplanes are
stationed at the Tonopah Test Range Air Field in Nevada. They are
attached to the 4450th Tactical Air Group at Nellis Air Force Base,
the Air Force said in statement last Nov. 10.
   Capt. Susan Strednansky, an Air Force spokeswoman at the
Pentagon, said she had no information about daylight flights of the
F-117A, but noted that the November announcement signaled that such
operations were imminent.
   ``Daytime flights have been available to them since we released
their existence,'' said Strednansky. ``If you fly it only at night,
you cannot integrate it into the rest of the Air Force.''
   Fifty-nine stealth fighters are being purchased from the
Lockheed Corp. at an undisclosed price, she said.
   Aviation Week, quoting unidentified residents of Mojave, said
the fighters were flying what appeared to be training missions at
5:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.
   Local residents, many of whom are aerospace workers, say the
F-117A makes an unsual noise, ``a distinctive, although faint,
engine whine'' that the magazine said may be caused by an unusal
design to the air intake.
   The stealth fighter, like the B-2 stealth bomber now under
development, is triangular in shape and incorporates design
features and material intended to make it all but invisible to
enemy targeting radar. The trailing edge of the wings is sawtooth
in shape, to avoid presenting right-angles to enemy radar, Aviation
Week reported.
   When the Air Force disclosed the existence of the F-117A last
November, it said the plane was first flown in June 1981 and had
been in operation since 1983.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Order on Help for Black Colleges and Universities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed an executive order
Friday aimed at giving historically black colleges and universities
greater federal assistance programs.
   Bush updated an existing order so that he could place a
presidential board of advisers on historically black colleges and
universities in the Education Department.
   ``Your voices must and will be heard,'' the president told
several dozen black educators gathered in the White House Rose
Garden to witness the signing ceremony.
   ``For over a hundred years,'' he said, ``the historically black
colleges and universities have been a special part of our heritage.
At a time when many schools barred their doors to black Americans,
these colleges offered the best _ and often the only _ opportunity
for a higher education.''
   ``And today, thank heavens, most of those barriers have been
brought down by the law,'' Bush said. ``And yet, historically black
colleges and universities still represent a vital component of
American higher education, enriching a great tradition of
educational choice and diversity in this country.''
   Along with setting up the advisory board, the executive order
directs federal agencies to increase opportunities for historically
black educational institutions to take part in various federal
programs and directs agencies to maximize opportunties for students
of these institutions to get part-time and summer jobs.
   ``It doesn't do much good to educate our young people if they
can't get good jobs when they get out,'' he said.

   President Bush intends to go ahead with the
controversial FSX fighter deal with Japan after reaching agreement
with Tokyo on conditions to safeguard sensitive technology and
guarantee a share of production for American companies,
congressional sources said Friday.
   Bush was scheduled to make a formal announcement in the White
House briefing room before the end of the day.
   The project is controversial because critics say it would give
U.S. aviation technology to Japan and hurt America's competitive
advantage.
   Bush had deliberated for many weeks on the proposed deal for
joint U.S.-Japanese production of the new fighter plane, an
advanced version of the U.S.-built F-16. The plane would be built
by General Dynamics and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
   The president had said previously he wanted to go ahead with the
joint venture as long as the agreement would safeguard U.S.
technology.
   Congress will have 30 days to review the agreement before it is
finalized.
   The deal was complicated this week by Japanese Prime Minister
Noburu Takeshita's announcement that he would resign because of the
influence peddling scandal that has paralyzed his government.
   Congressional sources, who spoke on condition they not be
identified, said the Japanese government had agreed to ensure that
40 percent of the estimated $5 billion production run on the plane
will be handled in the United States.
   The Japanese had already agreed to give U.S. companies a 40
percent share of the FSX's estimated $1.2 billion development work.
   On another key point, the congressional sources said, the
Japanese agreed to U.S. requests for protection of sensitive source
codes used for computers aboard the plane.
   The Reagan administration negotiated the arrangement initially
after Japan refused to buy any U.S. F-16 fighters and indicated it
would build its own fighter plane.
   Bush said last month that he would send Congress a modified
version of the Reagan administration agreement.
   Sources have said that among the assurances U.S. officials were
insisting on were an expanded role for the Commerce Department to
monitor the project and keep track of Japanese compliance.
   Reports from Tokyo earlier Friday said the agreement was near on
the project as the Defense Agency decided to retract its demand
that more than 50 percent of engine production work be given to
Japan and that Japan receive all computer software for flight
control of the U.S. F-16, which is the basis for the FSX jet.
   Backers of the venture say the project is a way to add fighters
to Japan's inventory in strategic northeast Asia at Tokyo's
expense. It also would provide jobs for the United States, and give
Washington access to sophisticated radar technology developed by
Japan.
   Under the FSX arrangement, St. Louis-based General Dynamics is
to join forces with Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to develop
and manufacture the next-generation fighter for deployment by Japan
in the late 1990s.
   Proponents have argued that the agreement represents the best
deal the United States could negotiate in the face of Japanese
opposition to buying F-16s directly from the United States. They
say the deal will serve to promote beneficial technology transfer
in both directions while generating income and jobs for U.S.
industry.
   Critics, however, contend that the arrangement amounts to a
giveaway of advanced technology that Japan may use to help propel
the its civilian aircraft industry into head-to-head competition
with the United States in the world market. They say Tokyo should
purchase American-made planes to help offset the $50 billion U.S.
trade deficit with Japan.
   In the face of congressional opposition, the Bush administration
conducted an interagency review culminating in heated Cabinet-level
meetings that pitted the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade
Representative against the Pentagon and State Department, which had
negotiated the FSX deal.
   As a result of these meetings, Bush sought ``clarifications''
from the Japanese to help safeguard sensitive technology and ensure
a share of the plane's production for U.S. industry.

   A woman who sued a liquor company over her son's
birth defects testified Friday that she drank herself unconscious
several times during her pregnancy, but never was warned that
alcohol would hurt her baby.
   Candance Thorp, 39, an admitted alcoholic, said under cross
examination that she drank heavily during the 1984 pregnancy, even
though she had previously been in alcohol treatment programs.
   David Strauber, an attorney for defendant Jim Beam Brands Co.,
asked Mrs. Thorp whether she drank herself into unconsciousness
every night of the pregnancy.
   ``At times I did,'' she said. ``A lot of times I did not.''
   Mrs. Thorp and her husband, Harold, of Seattle are seeking to
force Jim Beam to pay for lifetime care of their 4-year-old son
Michael, who is mentally retarded and has other birth defects in a
pattern known as fetal alcohol syndrome.
   They have maintained they would have stopped drinking if they
had known if could harm the unborn baby. They claim Jim Beam knew
of a link between alcohol consumption and birth defects, and was
negligent by failing to put warning labels on its products.
   Attorneys have said the trial is apparently the first in which
damages are sought from an alcohol company for FAS.
   The company has denied a link between alcohol and birth defects,
but also says any problems that may have been caused by alcohol in
Michael Thorp's case were due to Mrs. Thorp's own negligence.
   Mrs. Thorp testified that no doctor ever told her about the
dangers of drinking while pregnant, even though she had been in
several alcohol treatment programs and had two previous children.
   Under prodding from her attorney, Kandice Tezak, Mrs. Thorp also
noted Michael's birth defects on a large color picture displayed to
the jury. She noted the child's small nose, thin lips and lack of
indentation above the lip, and also said he had a short attention
span, poor coordination and was not toilet-trained.
   ``If I knew it would cause the birth defects it has I wouldn't
have drunk,'' Mrs. Thorp said, adding that she occasionally read
the label on bottles of Jim Beam liquor and that there were no
warnings against consumption by pregnant women.
   If there had been such a warning she would have stopped drinking
while pregnant, she said.
   Under cross-examination before the packed courtroom of U.S.
District Judge Carolyn Dimmick, a pattern emerged of continuous
drinking in the Thorp household before, during and after the
pregnancy.
   Mrs. Thorp admitted that while pregnant she sometimes drank
liquor with her husband in the morning before he went to work,
during the day while she did housework, and in the evenings.
   Mrs. Thorp testified that in all her pregnancies she was advised
to rest, exercise and eat well, but never was specifically told
that drinking could harm a fetus.
   She admitted drinking up to half a fifth of whiskey per day
before giving birth on Dec. 28, 1984.
   FAS was first identified in this country in the early 1970s by a
team of University of Washington researchers. An estimated 30,000
children are born in this country each year with FAS, according to
a 1982 study.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Dismissal Of Islanders Claim About Nuclear Tests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-member federal appeals court panel
Friday upheld the dismissal of suits by Pacific Islanders claiming
damages from U.S. nuclear tests.
   ``Congress has stripped the courts of jurisdiction over these
claims,'' declared the appeals court opinion by David Sentelle.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan ruled on June 16, 1987 that
federal courts have no jurisdiction to assess the validity of an
agreement giving the government of the Marshall Islands authority
to press claims of citizens for damages from the atomic tests
between 1946 and 1958.
   The Marshall Islands and the United States in 1986 signed a
Compact of Free Association giving the islands self-government
status. A federal law was passed endorsing the compact.
   Under the independence settlement, the United States gave the
Marshall Islands goverment $150 million to pay people claiming
damages from the U.S. nuclear tests in the 1940s and 1950s. The
plaintiffs claim that sum is insufficient and are attempting to sue
for more.
   On Aug. 22, 1983, while the compact and settlement were being
negotiated, some 3,000 island residents directly downwind from the
nuclear test sites filed suit in federal court. They sought damages
for personal injuries and death resulting from their exposure to
dangerous levels of radiation.
   Attorneys for the islanders had argued that the compact was
invalid and that technically the islands are still a territory of
the United States, under whose stewardship they operated for some
40 years.
   All three judges on the appeals panel affirmed the lower court
ruling.
   However, Sentelle was alone in his conclusion that the challenge
by the islanders raises a political question that was unreviewable
by the courts.
   ``While the treaty power of the executive expressly involves the
participation of the legislature, no where does the constitution
contemplate the participation by the third, non-political branch,
that is the judiciary,'' said Sentelle.
   Judge Kenneth Starr didn't concur with that section of
Sentelle's decision, saying the matter is an unreviewable political
question. Chief Judge Patricia Wald wrote a separate opinion.
   Wald argued that the Marshall Islands controversy falls outside
the political question doctrine on the basis of the Supreme Court's
consideration of questions with potentially substantial impact on
foreign relations.
   She also said: ``I am troubled by the majority's uncritical
assumption that Congress may deprive a narrow class of plaintiffs
of judicial relief, even if their claims are nonconstitutional.''
   Wald said the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the compact
and the ``espousal'' section settling nuclear testing claims ``were
consistently thought of as parts of a package.
   ``Congress did not seriously consider enacting one without the
other.''
   She said that she believes Congress intended that withdrawing
jurisdiction should be contingent on court approval of the espousal
mechanism settling nuclear testing claims.
   She found that mechanism valid, saying: ``I do not believe ...
that international law in any way forbids the agreement reached
here.''

<HEAD>Williams, Former Teamsters Chief, Dies Seven Months After Prison
Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEETON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roy Lee Williams, who rose from trucker to
international Teamsters president, died at his farm home Friday,
seven months after his release from a prison term for conspiring to
bribe a U.S. senator. He was 74.
   Williams had been in poor health for years with emphysema and an
enlarged heart and died just hours after a doctor was called to the
house.
   Williams, a protege of former Teamster President Jimmy Hoffa,
served as president from 1981-83. He was forced to resign the
presidency to delay the start of a 10-year sentence following his
conviction with four other men for attempting to bribe then-Sen.
Howard Cannon of Nevada to influence trucking deregulation.
   Danny Johnson, who now holds positions once held by Williams as
president of Teamsters Joint Council 56 and Local 41 in Kansas
City, praised his former boss.
   ``Roy Williams was the best thing to happen to the Teamsters
outside of Jimmy Hoffa,'' Johnson said Friday. ``There's been a lot
of bad publicity about him, and maybe some of it rightly so. But he
went to jail for trying to keep out deregulation, which has
eliminated over 160,000 Teamster jobs.''
   ``You couldn't ask for a better man, as a Teamster, as someone
that cared about his members, and as a leader of that movement,''
Johnson said.
   There was no immediate reaction to Williams' death from the
Teamsters union headquarters in Washington, but William J.
McCarthy, current union president, made it clear earlier this month
in testimony before Congress that he was no fan of Williams or
Hoffa, who disappeared in 1975 and is presumed dead.
   ``One was a cheat and one was a liar and both were mixed up with
La Cosa Nostra by their own admissions. I didn't care for either
one of them,'' McCarthy said.
   Williams testified at a casino skimming trial in Kansas City
that he had been on the payroll of the mob and under the domination
of Nick Civella, the late Kansas City crime boss. He said he
received $1,500 a month from late 1974, when he was a local
Teamster president, until mid-1981 when he was elected
international vice president.
   Williams' testimony in that trial and other racketeering cases
was designed to get his sentence _ originally set at 55 years _
reduced and to get him out of prison early. He continued to
cooperate with the government after his release last September from
the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Mo.
   Williams always maintained his innocence and said he was set up
in the bribery case. He also claimed that he cooperated with the
mob after the lives of his family members had been threatened by
Civella's henchmen.
   ``I am still just an old truck driver at heart,'' he said in a
January interview. ``It's over now, and I am glad of it. I still
have to meet my maker. But I can still say I didn't do nothing
wrong.''
   Williams' physician, Mark Vogt, said the former labor leader
died of complications of emphysema a few hours after he refused to
leave the house to go to the hospital.
   Vogt was called to the house about 5:30 a.m. Friday when
Williams had difficulty breathing. ``He was a little worse than
usual, but he did seem to improve,'' Vogt said. ``He'd had several
spells before, and he did not want to go to the hospital.''
   Vogt said he was called back about three hours later after
Williams' condition worsened. Paramedics were not able to revive
him.
   Williams is survived by two daughters and a grandson.

<HEAD>Law Protects Against Fake Mileage On Used Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new federal regulation goes into effect
Saturday aimed at protecting consumers from used car sellers who
change the odometer readings on cars.
   The rule implementing the 1986 Truth in Mileage Act requires
that records be kept of automobile mileage and is intended to make
it possible for a would-be buyer to trace the actual mileage of a
vehicle.
   Although waivers have been given in several states that have
said they need more time to change forms, the law requires that
motor vehicle titles issued after Saturday must be printed so that
counterfeiting and alterations can easily be detected.
   It also requires that mileage readings be disclosed on the title
whenever the car is sold. If the title does not have a space for
the odometer reading, a separate disclosure statement is required.
   Used car dealers, leasing companies and auto auctions must
maintain records, including the mileage of vehicles sold, for at
least five years.
   Federal laws prohibit tampering with odometers. In 1987, the
latest year for which the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration has a complete report, 17 cases of large-scale
odometer fraud were sent to the Justice Department and five others
to state enforcement agencies.
   Some of the cases led to civil action, and eight federal grand
jury indictments led to 14 criminal convictions, said agency
spokesman Tim Hurd.

   Here is the text of President Bush's
announcement Friday that the United States intends to go ahead with
plans to produce the FSX fighter plane with Japan.
   I'm pleased to announce that the governments of the United
States and Japan have reached understandings that will allow us to
proceed with joint development of the FSX fighter aircraft.
   I'm ready to submit the FSX agreement to Congress for its review.
   We've been conducting talks with the Japanese to clarify both
sides' understanding to this agreement.
   I'm convinced that the co-development of this aircraft is in the
strategic and commercial interests of the United States.
   And we weighed this matter from the standpoint of trade, of our
industrial growth, and technology transfer, as well as strategic
and foreign policy considerations.
   This aircraft will improve the basic F-16 design and will
contribute to the security of the United States and our major ally,
Japan.
   There will be no cost to the American taxpayer.
   And, at the same time, the Japanese will improve their ability
to carry their share of the defense burden.
   The U.S. will have a 40 percent work share in the initial
development stage of this aircraft.
   And we will have a similar share when the aircraft goes into
production.
   We did have several initial concerns about the agreement.
   But I want to assure you that sensitive source codes for the
aircraft's computer will be strictly controlled.
   Access will be granted to only those codes that are essential to
complete the project.
   In conclusion, the United States is the world's leader in
aircraft manufacturing.
   I believe this aircraft will improve the defense of the United
States and Japan.
   And this agreement also helps preserve our commitment that U.S.
aerospace products of the future will continue to dominate the
world markets.
   That's the end of the statement.
   Thank you all very much.

<HEAD>Criticism of Governing Party Increases With Budget Passage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Criticism of the governing party, already wracked
by a bribery scandal, increased Friday after it forced the 1989
budget through Parliament's lower house without opposition
participation for the first time in postwar history.
   The opposition condemned the move, and for the first time in
nine years more Japanese said they supported the opposition parties
than the governing Liberal Democratic Party, according to a
newspaper poll.
   In 35 years of unbroken rule, the Liberal Democrats had never
completely ignored the opposition in voting on the budget, even
though they hold an overwhelming majority in Parliament.
   The $455 billion budget was subject to only two days of public
debate in February. According to the constitution, the budget now
goes to the upper house for approval, but it will be implemented on
May 27 if that assembly fails to pass it.
   The opposition had stalled budget deliberations since February
by boycotting parliamentary sessions to press their demand that
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone testify about his links to
Recruit Co., a business and publishing conglomerate at the center
of the bribery and stock-profiteering scandal.
   The government has been operating on an interim budget since
April 1. With the government unable to issue bonds or authorize new
public works projects, analysts said business confidence was in
danger of falling. This may have helped prompt the move by the
Liberal Democratic Party, which has close ties with big business,
analysts said.
   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita announced he would
resign after the budget is approved to take responsibility for the
Recruit scandal, which has brought sharp public criticism of his
administration and his party.
   Japanese political tradition holds that the governing party
should provide an opportunity for opposition parties to participate
in parliamentary debate and vote even if they comprise only a
minority.
   Opposition politicians blocked a hallway leading to the lower
house in an attempt to prevent the vote on the budget, but guards
pushed them aside to get Speaker Kenzaburo Hara into the 512-seat
chamber.
   One independent lawmaker voted against the budget, which passed
by a 281-1 margin.
   The party's budget action was ``an outrage unprecedented since
the end of World War II ... and a serious challenge to the
people,'' said Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party,
the largest opposition group.
   The deputy speaker of the house, a former Socialist, said he
would resign his post, while an upper house lawmaker from a minor
opposition party said he would quit Parliament to protest the
governing party's move. Four Liberal Democrats also boycotted the
vote in protest against their party's action, while 11 members were
absent.
   In a survey conducted by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun, 44 percent
of 2,403 respondents said they supported one of Japan's five main
opposition parties or other minor parties, while 42 percent said
they supported the Liberal Democrats. The poll was taken
immediately after Takeshita announced his plans to resign and was
to appear in the newspaper's Saturday editions.
   An Asahi editorial Saturday called for the dissolution of
Parliament for new elections and a ``radical reform of politics in
our country.''
   Takeshita is to leave Saturday for a week-long trip to Southeast
Asia and is expected to step down after his return.
   News reports continued to speculate on who would be his
successor, with many analysts expecting that former Foreign
Minister Masayoshi Ito, 75, would eventually accept the post
although he has so far refused suggestions that he take the job.
   In the scandal, Recruit sold unlisted stocks at low prices to
about 160 prominent people, including politicians and businessmen.
Many of the recipients sold their shares after they were listed
publicly and rose sharply in value.
   Takeshita has admitted receiving more than $1 million in
political donations from Recruit in 1985-87.
   Before attending the budget session, Takeshita attended the
funeral of Ihei Aoki, his top aide and fund controller, who
committed suicide Wednesday.
   Aoki had purchased Recruit shares and used the profits to
finance Takeshita's political expenses. The prime minister's
announcement Tuesday that he would resign apparently prompted Aoki
to hang himself.

   Edward J. Perkins, a veteran black diplomat
now serving as U.S. ambassador to South Africa, will head the U.S.
foreign service, and Morris Busby, a specialist on Central America,
is to be the State Department's anti-terrorism chief, U.S.
officials said Friday.
   Perkins will succeed George S. Vest, 70, the department's senior
foreign service officer who is retiring next Wednesday. Perkins,
60, was sent to Pretoria by former President Reagan in 1986 in an
effort to demonstrate U.S. interest in bridging the gap between
blacks and whites in the country.
   He previously was U.S. ambassador to Liberia and director of
West African affairs at the department.
   Busby was named special envoy for Central America in 1987 and
has traveled extensively in the region to bolster U.S. ties to
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. He will succeed L.
Paul Bremer, who is leaving the foreign service to join a
consulting firm operated by former Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger.
   The appointment of Perkins, which requires Senate confirmation,
symbolizes the rise through diplomatic ranks of a new breed of
foreign service officer outside the traditional mold of white Ivy
Leaguers. The proportion of women and blacks has been on the rise
for several years.
   Perkins served in the Far East and Africa, and in the State
Department's Near East and South Asian bureau. He is a graduate of
the University of Maryland and the University of Southern
California and speaks Thai, French and Japanese.
   The job of director-general will put him in charge of all
personnel activities in the department and in the foreign service
worldwide. This includes recruiting, hiring, assignments, promotion
and discharge.
   He will report directly to Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Vest, who has served for 49 years, including World War II
military duty, calls it ``a wonderful job.''
   ``I deal with every human problem there is,'' he said in a brief
interview.
   Vest described Perkins as ``a fantastic professional, first and
last'' and said ``he will be a marvelous director of the foreign
service.''
   Vest is a former U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organzation and the European Community and also served as a
spokesman for Kissinger.
   Busby, whose nomination also requires Senate confirmation, will
be in charge of efforts at the department to counter terrorism.

<HEAD>Panama Tells U.N. Washington Plots Armed Intervention</HEAD>

   Panama's foreign minister accused the
United States on Friday of subversion and plotting military
intervention, and the U.S. ambassador retorted that Panamanian
elections next week are rigged and a fraud.
   Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter excoriated the U.S. government at
an emergency meeting of the Security Council requested by Panama,
saying Washington was trying to bully and intimidate his nation.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, the permanent
representative, rejected the allegations and said, ``The moral
bankruptcy of the regime of Gen. Manuel Noriega for which Mr.
Ritter speaks is well known.''
   Noriega is armed forces chief and as such, de facto leader of
Panama.
   Pickering accused Panama's government of blatantly interfering
in the election process; manipulating voters' lists; muzzling the
opposition, press and TV, and restricting access by impartial
foreign monitors and journalists.
   The meeting was adjourned after the Panamanian and U.S.
speeches. No action was taken and no further meeting was scheduled.
   Ritter said the United States has supplied millions of dollars
to opposition candidates opposing Noriega and has sent commandos,
special weapons and helicopters to that Central American nation
right before elections May 7.
   He accused the United States of trying to subvert democratic
elections, set up a puppet, pro-Washington government and undermine
the Panama Canal Treaty.
   ``U.S. plans of interfering in the Panamanian electoral process
have entered a phase of direct participation,'' Ritter told the
15-member council.
   ``The objective is undermining public order, causing chaos,
promoting widespread destabilization in the country around election
time and creating a pretext for military intervention in Panama.''
   He said U.S. intervention was jeopardizing regional peace and
security.
   In February 1988, Noriega was indicted on federal drug charges
in Florida. He denied the charges. The United States imposed
economic sanctions against Panama, trying to force out Noriega.
   Ritter also complained that Pickering did not address the
specific complaint that the U.S. government was sending special
arms and making non-defensive military preparations in Panama as a
prelude to using force.
   He referred to a statement Thursday by Bush, who said the
Noriega-controlled government is committing systematic fraud and is
employing violence and coercion to intimidate Panamanian citizens
who believe in democracy.
   Pickering said, ``We are discussing Panama before the Security
Council because the regime will not permit a free and open debate
to take place among the Panamanian people. The solution to Panama's
lack of democracy does not lie here in the Security Council, but in
Panama.''
   He said Panama's crisis stemmed not from any U.S. plot to
interfere, but from ``the policies of Gen. Noriega, who has
arrogated to himself complete power over civic life and sponsored
and countenanced widescale corruption, drug trafficking and
gun-running.''
   The ambassador said the United States has grave doubts about the
honesty of Panama's election process. The human rights commission
of the Organization of American States also expressed concern about
``extensive irregularities'' interfering in free elections,
Pickering said.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said Friday that through ``manipulation and intimidation the
Noriega regime is making it extremely difficult for international
observers to perform their functions.
   ``We hope that despite the many roadblocks which Noriega is
putting in their way, observers will go to Panama to see and tell
the truth about what is going on there.
   She expressed hope that Panama will let former Presidents Jimmy
Carter and Gerald Ford monitor the elections there. Panamanian
officials have said they would be welcome.
   Noriega is backing Carlos Alberto Duque for president against
Guillermo Endara of the opposition Democratic Alliance. Endara
denied that his campaign received U.S. funds.
   Voters will also choose two vice presidents, 67 asembly
representatives and 510 local representatives.

<HEAD>Bush Touts No New Taxes for Now, But Concedes `Long Way to Go' in
1991</HEAD>

   President Bush on Friday touted his adherence
to his ``no new taxes'' pledge for 1990 but conceded that ``we
still have a ways to go'' to bring the deficit in line with
mandated Gramm-Rudman targets for the following year.
   Bush, in comments to the American Legislative Exchange Council,
said that ``rough times lie ahead'' for his administration on the
economy.
   He praised his budget agreement with congressional leaders for
meeting the deficit-reduction target of the Gramm-Rudman law for
the 1990 fiscal year. While the agreement has $5.3 billion in
unspecified new revenues, Bush has said those won't be new taxes.
   ``And I kept that `no new taxes' pledge,'' Bush added. ``But we
still have a ways to go because we've got to go move dramatically
down in the next fiscal year to meet the Gramm-Rudman targets which
I'm determined to do. And that does mean we have to have fiscal
restraint in a lot of areas where, very candidly, I wish we could
do more.''
   Bush's no-new-taxes pledge was a campaign rallying cry that many
critics say will be impossible to live up to for another year and
still reduce the budget deficit below the ceiling set by the
Gramm-Rudman legislation.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, asked later if Bush was
hinting that he might entertain some backing away from the no-taxes
vow, said, ``I don't interpret that as any hints of any changes.''
   Asked whether the president might go along with congressional
Democrats and approve tax increases a few months down the line,
Fitzwater said Bush was looking at all future budget decisions
carefully, and that as the next Gramm-Rudman target approaches
``Clearly those decisions will be even tougher in terms of '91 and
'92.''
   ``We have brought the deficit down steadily from something like
$212 billion to $150 (billion) and now to $100 (billion), but it's
clear that the last 100 is going to be very difficult.''
   Fitzwater said, however, that Bush was vowing to keep his
non-new-taxes pledge in 1990.
   Bush also reiterated that he will not ``cave in'' on his
proposal to raise the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour and to tie it
to a lower six-month training wage. Congressional negotiators are
now working on a proposal to increase the minimum wage to $4.55 an
hour with a more restrictive two-month training wage.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional 1.05
million metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a
long-term supply agreement, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Officials said the latest corn sales by unidentified private
exporters pushed the total grain bought by the Soviets this year to
almost 18.3 million tons, close to the record 18.6 million tons
Moscow purchased from the United States in 1984-85. Corn makes up
about 14.3 million tons and wheat 4 million.
   The corn is scheduled for delivery by Sept. 30, the end of the
sixth year of a long-term grain supply agreement between the Soviet
Union and the United States.
   Additionally, the department said 1988-89 sales to the Soviets
include about 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean
meal, and 607,400 tons of grain sorghum.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 1.05 million tons
of corn would be about 41 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.53 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of more than $100
million.

<TEXT>
   A cease-fire negotiated by the Arab
League was strained by repeated violations Friday, threatening a
renewal of the shelling duels between Lebanese Christian and Syrian
troops that killed 273 people.
   The truce that ended 52 days of bombardments also was
jeopardized by differences of interpretation over who controls the
ports _ the issue that started the fighting.
   A police spokesman said Syrians and their Druse Moslem allies
fired sporadic salvos of rockets at the Christian port of Byblos
from about 1:30 p.m. to nightfall, but no casualties were reported.
The cease-fire went into effect at noon Friday.
   The spokesman said the Christian gunners did not retaliate.
   ``Infractions are so far of a minor nature, but they could
collapse the cease-fire if they continue or intensify,'' said the
spokesman, who was not identified in line with regulations.
   He also said that at about 1:30 p.m., two howitzer shells fired
from Syrian-controlled mountains southeast of Beirut hit the
Christian sector but caused no casualties.
   On Friday before the cease-fire began, Syrian troops and
Christian militiamen intermittently fired howitzer and mortar
rounds across the Green Line that divides the capital into Moslem
west Beirut and Christian east Beirut, police reported. They said
there were no casualties.
   During the 52 days of frequently heavy shelling at least 993
people were wounded.
   The truce was announced Thursday at the end of an emergency
meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Tunis, Tunisia.
   The agreement provides for an unspecified number of Arab
observers to monitor the cease-fire, thus loosening Syria's grip as
Lebanon's main powerbroker.
   The cease-fire is the fourth attempt by the 22-nation Arab
League to halt the fighting. It was welcomed by the main parties to
the conflict _ Syria and Lebanese Christian army commander Gen.
Michel Aoun.
   Aoun, who had declared a ``war of liberation'' from Syria,
called the truce ``the first step toward a broader pan-Arab role in
Lebanon, which would weaken Syria's monopoly of the decision-making
process in our country.''
   In Damascus, Syria, President Hafez Assad's government said it
is ``satisified with resolutions announced by the Arab League.''
Syria initially sent its 40,000 troops into Lebanon in 1976 on a
peacekeeping mandate from the league.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said Washington supported the decision to send in Arab League
observers. She added that outside parties involved in Lebanon must
exercise ``utmost restraint.'' Under questioning, Ms. Tutwiler said
that statement was a reference to Syria.
   A U.N. spokesman in Geneva said U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar would meet Saturday with the chairman of the Arab
League committee that drafted the plan.
   The meeting follows a statement by the U.N. Security Council
supporting the Arab League's peace efforts and urging that Perez de
Cuellar ``make all possible efforts and ... contacts which could be
deemed useful.''
   The league truce calls for lifting the air, sea and land
blockades imposed during the fighting.
   An earlier statement from Aoun's Cabinet welcomed ``lifting of
blockades imposed on legal ports besieged by the Syrian forces.''
   It said maritime agencies should ``instruct their ships to head
to legal ports.''
   Aoun appears to be maintaining a blockade of ports run by
Syrian-backed militias, a step likely to jeopardize the truce.
   Moslem army brigade commanders said the ``cease-fire and the
lifting of blockades were a whole package agreement.''
   The present confrontation broke out March 8, two days after Aoun
ordered a blockade of militia-run ports that deny the state
treasury $100 million a year in customs dues.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's militia retaliated by shelling
the 310-square-mile Christian enclave. Syrian gunners joined.
   The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio, the organ of the
right-wing Phalange party, voiced concern the truce is ``mere
security tranquilizers.''
   The Syrian-backed Moslem Cabinet of acting Premier Salim Hoss,
which competes with the Aoun government in running Lebanon, pledged
``full cooperation'' in the truce.
   It made no comment on Aoun's order Friday that Beirut
International Airport reopen. The country's only airport, located
on the edge of Moslem west Beirut, closed March 12 after Christian
gunners targeted it. A source close to Hoss said the airport will
stay closed until the Moslem Cabinet decides otherwise.

   China's most liberal newspaper, the Shanghai
World Economic Herald, resumed publication Friday after Shanghai's
city government fired chief editor Qin Benli and replaced him with
a propagandist, Chinese sources said.
   The weekly is widely read by Chinese intellectuals and students.
The city forced it to stop distribution of its April 24 edition and
remove articles it said were likely to cause ``disturbances.''
   Liu Ji, a senior propaganda official, replaced Qin after Qin
refused to comply, saying it would constitute undue official
control of the press, the sources said.
   The original issue carried six pages of articles and speeches
honoring the late Hu Yaobang, said an editor at the newspaper's
Beijing bureau.
   ``The items the government said were likely to cause
disturbances have been taken out,'' he said.
   The excised articles apparently asked the party to revise its
assessment of Hu, who was ousted as Communist Party chief after
failing to crack down on student demonstrations in 1986-87.
   Hu's death on April 15 touched off major protests by students
demanding democratic reforms.
   Journalists at several major dailies have shown support for the
Herald.
   China's state-controlled press has moved gradually toward
independence in its reporting on economic policies and news, but
criticism of senior leaders, questioning Communist one-party rule
or delving into sensitive subjects such as unrest in Tibet are
off-limits.

   A wildfire in Florida burned 4,000 to 6,000 acres of the Osceola
National Forest on Friday, sending smoke 45 miles to Jacksonville,
and 7,000 acres burned in a week-old fire in southeastern New York.
   ``It's still burning uncontained,'' said Scott Enos, supervisor
of the Florida Division of Forestry in Lake City. ``We don't expect
any relief from the weather before Monday.''
   Westerly winds carried the smoke and the National Weather
Service warned of dense smoke in Jacksonville over the weekend
unless the fire is brought under control. Enos said the smoke was
not blowing over major highways.
   The U.S. Forest Service said 100 firefighters were fighting the
blaze in Pinhook Swamp, 23 miles northeast of Lake City.
   Enos said no structures have been damaged, and there have been
no injuries.
   The origin of the fire, which began Thursday, was under
investigation. It began on land adjacent to the forest owned by a
subsidiary of Container Corp.
   High winds, low humidity and dry brush and trees hampered
firefighters' efforts in New York.
   Capt. Raymond Wood, regional forest ranger for the state
Depatment of Environmental Conservation in New Paltz, compared this
spring's stubborn blazes in Orange and Rockland counties to the
vast fires that burned for much of last summer in the western
United States.
   Wood said the presence of two superhighways in the region, the
New York state Thruway and Palisades Interstate Parkway, have been
key to preventing even more extensive burning.
   ``I think that if it had not been for the Parkway and the
Thruway, these things just would have kept getting bigger and
bigger,'' he said. ``It's just like out west, you do everything
humanly possible and the fire does what it wants anyway.''
   Paul Rinaldi, a DEC forest ranger in New Paltz, said the fire
had burned about 3,000 acres of timber.
   ``The burning conditions are absolutely right, just
incredible,'' Rinaldi said. ``We're not getting the humidity or the
rain so everything is very dry. ... We're seeing fires that are
jumping bulldozer lines, macadam roads _ it's beyond belief.''

<HEAD>Supertanker Grounded, Oil Leak Reported</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Indian supertanker ran aground off the
Saudi Arabian coast, and officials at Lloyd's in London said Friday
that about 1.5 million gallons of oil leaked into the Red Sea.
   The 276,744-ton Kanchenjunga had taken on 42 million gallons of
Saudi crude oil from the Yanbu terminal near Jiddah and was on its
way to Bombay when it ran aground Wednesday night.
   The vessel, owned by the state-run Shipping Corporation of
India, sustained some holes when it lodged on a reef about six
miles from Yanbu.
   In London, Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit said about 1.5
million gallons of oil had leaked into the Red Sea from the
Kanchenjunga's three damaged tanks, one on the port side and two on
the starboard side. It said those tanks contained close to 8.4
million gallons of light crude.
   An oil slick was drifting out to sea, and pollution experts, who
arrived on Thursday, were assessing the situation and had asked for
salvage crews, Lloyd's said.
   Lloyd's said the grounding occurred at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday.
Authorities in the port of Jiddah were also investigating the
situation, it said.
   Shipping executives here said most of the oil would have to be
pumped out before the ship can be refloated.
   They said another tanker would have to come alongside the
Kanchenjunga and the oil pumped into it with the help of salvage
tugboats.
   Earlier Wednesday, a Liberian-flag oil tanker was slightly
damaged in the Persian Gulf off Abu Dhabi by an explosion caused by
a drifting mine. The mines are left over from the Iran-Iraq war,
which came to a halt in August with a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire.

   Senegalese angered by violence against
their countrymen in neighboring Mauritania attacked Mauritanians in
Dakar on Friday, killing at least 20 people, officials said.
   Authorities in Senegal, in an order broadcast by state radio,
declared a state of emergency in the capital and a curfew from 10
p.m. to 6 a.m., to be in effect for at least six days. Under the
state of emergency, all public and private gatherings are banned.
   The violence began this month in dispute over land near the
border between the West African nations. Reports say more than 150
people have been killed.
   Several thousand Senegalese assembled Friday around the hospital
at Grand-Yoff on the outskirts of Dakar, where survivors of the
violence in Mauritania were being treated after being flown home.
   Police used tear gas to try to break up the mob, but the
officials said on condition of anonymity that at least 20
Mauritanians were killed.
   President Abdou Diouf was among the Senegalese who visited the
hospital, but reporters said he broke down in tears and cut short
his visit.
   Among the 281 people being treated, some had their sex organs or
limbs mutilated, and most of the corpses brought home had been
decapitated, the reporters with the president said.
   Word of the nature of the injuries enraged the crowd, which then
went seeking Mauritanians, many of whose homes and shops had been
burned or looted this week.
   A few hundred Mauritanians were flown home to Nouakchott after
the earlier violence, but many others had been gathered at the
Dakar fairgrounds to await repatriation. Many of the angry
Senegalese headed to the fairgrounds in search of vengeance.
   Mauritania's ambassador to Dakar, Mokhtar Ould Zamel, said a An
Air Mauritanie plane that arrived Friday afternoon to take about 80
people home was forced to leave more than half of them behind when
Senegalese attacked the passengers.
   He said airport authorities urged the plane to take off without
the others because its presence was considered a provocation.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse quoted what it said
was a good source in Dakar as saying Senegalese planes were denied
permission to fly to Mauritania to pick up refugees, apparently in
response to the airport incident in Senegal.
   According to news reports in Dakar, between 150 and 200 people,
both Mauritanians and Senegalese, were killed by mobs on Monday and
Tuesday in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou, the second largest city in
Mauritania.
   The government in Nouakchott said it had no official casualty
report, but a source in the capital's main public hospital said 26
people died there and 675 others were treated for injuries. Others
may have died at other hospitals or clinics, he said.
   The government of Senegal declared it has the right to respond
by any measures necessary if it is established that Mauritanian
forces were responsible for killing Senegalese.
   The violence was spawned by a land dispute along the river
separating the countries. Two Senegalese, accused of farming
illegally on Mauritanian land, were shot April 9. Sporadic attacks
on Mauritanians in Senegal blew up into widespread attacks,
sparking retaliation.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raul Sendic, founder of the extreme left Tupamaros
movement in Uruguay, died Friday in Paris, where he was undergoing
treatment for a neurological illness, officials at the Edouard Rist
clinic said. He was 63.
   Sendic long suffered from neurological problems believed to be
the result of torture in Uruguayan prisons in the early 1970s. He
had lived in France for the past two years.
   Sendic's tightly organized urban guerrilla cells were a model
for Central American, Argentine and Chilean movements to follow.
The cells used cleancut youths from old families to infiltrate the
government they sought to topple.
   After 13 years in prison, Sendic was freed in 1985 along with
many other political prisoners after the civilian government of
President Julio Sanguinetti replaced Uruguay's military regime.
   Sendic organized strikes in the sugar cane fields and hunger
marches in 1960-61, then changed to an urban guerrilla strategy
with the founding in 1963 of the National Liberation Front.
   The front is called the MLN by its Spanish initials but is
better known as the Tupamaros, after Tupac Amaru, an 18th-century
Inca chief burned at the stake by the Spaniards.
   The Tupamaros raided food warehouses, redistributing their booty
to the poor, and later moved into kidnappings for ransom to raise
money.
   One such incident inspired the film ``State of Siege,'' by
director Costa Gavras, starring Yves Montand as the American
advisor to the Uruguayan police who was kidnapped and later killed.
   The MLN's first legal convention was held in December 1985,
where delegates voted to abandon armed struggle in favor of
non-violent political action, with a Marxist and nationalist
program favoring labor and land reform.
   Sendic was wounded and captured by soldiers in September 1972.
   He was held without trial for 12 years, during which his family
and human rights campaigners protested the conditions of his
detention.
   He was convicted and sentenced to 45 years in prison in 1984,
but released the following year.

   The Heinz company said Friday it will destroy its
stocks of baby food in British stores and replace them with food in
tamper-proof jars after extortionists contaminated the product.
   It said stocks removed from stores will be replaced in two to
three weeks by jars enclosed in heat-sealed plastic sleeves. H.J.
Heinz Co. Ltd., the British subsidiary of the Pittsburgh-based H.J.
Heinz Co., sells about 170 million jars of baby food a year in
Britain.
   Heinz officials were unable to say immediately how many
containers of baby food would have to be destroyed or to give a
monetary value.
   Police investigating nearly 300 reports of contaminated baby
food said two apparently were the work of one man demanding up to
$1.7 million from Heinz.
   Detectives at Scotland Yard police headquarters said they
believe the vast majority of the incidents involved ``copycats,
people getting on the bandwagon, cranks and some cases of
self-contamination.''
   Arrests have been reported in connection with hoaxes, Scotland
Yard said.
   A 14-month-old boy, Matthew Cookson, was the latest casualty of
the potentially deadly campaign. He was hospitalized in Manchester
with glass in his stomach after eating a jar of baby's yogurt that
was found to contain glass. A doctor at Booths Hall Hospital said
Matthew was not at risk.
   In three earlier cases, two mothers cut their fingers on glass
in baby food and a 9-month-old girl cut her mouth when she bit on a
piece of razor blade in yogurt.
   The tampering reports began April 7.
   The news agency Press Association said detectives believe the
extortionists may have mastered a sophisticated technique of
resealing jars. The small glass jars have metal lids with an
indented center, which indicates the vacuum seal has not been
broken.
   Ted Smyth, director of corporate affairs at Heinz's headquarters
in Pittsburgh, flew to London on Thursday night.
   He said, ``We will never pay the blackmailers,'' when asked
about British news reports that some unidentified companies had
handed over a total $850,000 to extortionists. The reports have not
been confirmed.
   Smyth pledged his company will do everything possible to catch
those responsible.
   He described people lacing baby food with broken glass,
thumbtacks, pins, needles, razor blade fragments and caustic soda
as ``thugs and terrorists.''
   ``I am absolutely outraged and disgusted. These people are
attacking the most vulnerable sections of our society _ babies,''
Smyth said.
   Cow and Gate Ltd., a baby food manufacturer that shares 80
percent of the British market with Heinz, said it had received no
demands. Most of the objects were found in Heinz or Cow and Gate
products, but several were in other brands of baby food.
   A Scotland Yard statement said police believed the man who made
the demands to Heinz also tried to extort money from a pet food
company last fall.
   Police refused to name the pet food company, but British
Broadcasting Corp. television said Pedigree Petfoods paid $34,000
to stop the threats.
   It said the money was placed in a bank account. Earlier reports
said most of the money then was withdrawn through bank machines and
that police failed to catch the cuprits.

   The Bush administration on Friday won a
reprieve from a judge's order to release 1,200 semiautomatic rifles
that had been impounded as part of a temporary ban on importing
assault weapons.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta granted the
Justice Department's request for a temporary stay of a lower court
order that the U.S. Customs Service release the rifles impounded at
the Birmingham, Ala., airport.
   The government had contended that the federal district judge's
ruling Wednesday could undermine the import ban imposed last month
following public outcry over increased use of assault weapons in
drug killings.
   The Justice Department said the suit by an Alabama gun dealer
challenged ``actions taken by responsible officials to combat the
growing epidemic of violent crime and to insure that the statute
governing gun importation is properly enforced.''
   The three-judge panel's ruling came about an hour after U.S.
District Judge William Acker Jr. in Birmingham refused to stay his
order, which was issued Wednesday in a lawsuit brought by the gun
importer.
   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms last month
temporarily suspended importation of up to 640,000 foreign-made
weapons while it determined if the guns were being used for
legitimate sporting purposes.
   The government's ``ability to protect the public during the
review process would by definition be irreparably damaged if one of
the very weapons under scrutiny is allowed to be imported'' and
used to kill someone, the Justice Department said in court papers.
   Acker ordered the Customs Service to release 1,200 Steyr AUG-SA
rifles made in Austria.
   Gun South Inc. of Trussville, Ala., contended in its suit that
the permit it obtained to import 5,200 Steyr rifles was approved
before the ATF ban took effect.
   Gun South, meanwhile, sought an order Friday from Acker that the
government show cause why it shouldn't be held in contempt of the
judge's order for refusing to turn over the guns on Thursday.
   Donald Wood, the company's president, said in an affidavit that
the head of the Customs Service's Birmingham office refused to give
him the weapons. Wood said Eldon Green, the Customs official, told
him he was under orders from superiors in Washington not to release
the guns despite the judge's order.
   In its filing, the Justice Department said that the court order
should be stayed because ``once released to plaintiff and sold to
the public, the weapons are effectively outside the control of the
defendants, and therefore, capable of being put to anti-personnel
uses which the ongoing ATF review is designed to investigate.''
   The government said Acker's ruling ``is likely to spur similar
actions'' by other gun importers.
   ``While the 5,200 guns imported by Gun South are a clearly
significant number of weapons, the suspension of outstanding
permits applies to approximately 640,000 guns,'' the Justice
Department noted.
   ``The specter of release of approximately 640,000 weapons which
are unlikely to be recovered upon possible reversal of the district
court's judgment highlights the potential for harm to the public,''
the government's brief said.
   Acker's order does not affect other rifles, but in his ruling he
criticized the ban, which was initiated by William Bennett, the
federal drug policy coordinator. Acker held that the import ban
interferes with Congress' right to enact laws.

<HEAD>Justice Department Sues Insurer Over Medicare Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department filed suit Friday to
recover millions of dollars in Medicare payments it claimed should
have been paid for elderly workers insured by the Travelers
Insurance Companies.
   The lawsuit against the Hartford-based insurance company was
filed as part of the government's continuing investigation to
recover payment by Medicare of medical expenses that should have
been paid by private companies insuring elderly workers.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in New Haven, Conn.,
charged that the Medicare overpayments were made to elderly workers
and their spouses covered by group-health insurance plans
underwritten by Travelers.
   The Justice Department suit did not seek a specific amount of
money, but Assistant Attorney General John R. Bolton said in a
statement that the government believes it is owed millions of
dollars.
   A public relations spokesman for the company could not be
reached at the Travelers' headquarters in Hartford.
   The suit charges that Travelers paid only benefits not covered
by Medicare despite 1982 legislation that made private insurance
companies the primary payers of health insurance for employed
workers between the ages of 65 and 69.
   Similar lawsuits have been filed against Blue Cross-Blue Shield
of Michigan and Provident Life and Accident Insurance Co. of
Chattanooga, Tenn.
   Bolton said the department ``will continue to bring these
lawsuits where warranted to stop this practice and to return to the
Medicare program the money that has been overpaid.''
   An audit by the Department of Health and Human Services
uncovered the overpayments, which some officials estimate could
total hundreds of millions of dollars.
   The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that its
examination of Medicare records suggested the overpayments could
total as much as $10 billion since 1983.

<HEAD>Official Suggests Protesters to Blame for Georgia Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Interior Ministry's political
department, A.I. Grienko, suggested Friday that Georgian
demonstrators were responsible for violence that cost lives at a
pro-independence protest on April 9.
   Grienko told Soviet journalists that troops try not to use force
to break up demonstrations, but the protest in the Georgian
capital, Tbilisi, was not peaceful.
   At least 19 people were killed when troops wielding shovels and
clubs, firing gas and riding armored personnel carriers and tanks
moved in on the demonstration outside Government House in downtown
Tbilisi. At least one more person was shot and killed later for
violating a curfew.
   Georgian activists contend the troops brutally moved in without
warning and attacked peaceful demonstrators.
   Grienko said ministry troops display ``the highest
professionalism, so there won't be victims from any of our actions.
... But that doesn't depend on us, because two sides are acting.''
   He said the soldiers try to obey the law, respect people and be
fair, but ``unfortunately, they don't always manage to do this''
because of opposing forces.
   Grienko's remarks were broadcast on Soviet television's evening
news broadcast ``Vremya.''
   Also on the program, deputy Soviet prosecutor Alexander F.
Katusev said four Georgian activists arrested shortly after the
demonstration were charged with being ``organizers of, and active
participants in group actions violating public order.''
   Katusev said military prosecutors are investigating whether use
of gases to put down the demonstration was proper, and what the 19
protesters died of. Most of those killed were women.
   Soviet officials acknowledged that soldiers used tear gas.
Members of a citizen's commission investigating the confrontation
and doctors treating victims say a second gas that paralyzes the
central nervous system was used. Georgia's Communist Party chief,
Givi Gumbaridze, said some victims died of gas poisoning.

<HEAD>Court Frees Four Accused Of Spying For CIA</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three men and a woman accused of
spying for the CIA and held for months were freed Friday after an
appeals court overturned their convictions.
   They had been given prison sentences ranging from three years to
16 years.
   International human rights groups had protested the trials held
in May and June, 1988, claiming they were political trials.
   Three were released from the La Modelo prison outside Managua,
and they were met by their lawyers and weeping relatives. All
declared again their innocence.
   ``If I had been a CIA agent they would never have released me,''
said economist Mario Alegria. He had been accused of organizing a
network among government employees to provide economic data to the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
   Alegria's lawyer, Hernaldo Zuniga, said the appeals court
accepted the argument he and the other defense attorneys had
presented: that none of the laws applicable in the case defined
what a ``secret document'' is and the economic information involved
was public knowlege and not secret.
   Nora Aldana, who had been a planning specialist with the
Agriculture Ministry, told The Associated Press she found out about
the appeals court ruling about an hour before she was allowed to
leave the prison. She was met by her mother and oldest daughter.
   ``Inside, I always knew I had done nothing wrong,'' said Ms.
Aldana, 45.
   Adrian Espinales wiped tears from his eyes and hugged relatives
after leaving La Modelo.
   ``I have always said I am innocent,'' said Espinales who worked
at the Ministry of Interior. ``I did not commit any crime.''
   Pedro Pablo Su, was released from another prison near Managua.
He had been employed at the Central Bank when he was arrested.
   Alegria and Ms. Aldana had been given prison sentences of 16
years and Espinales and Su were sentenced to three years.
   Zuniga said that in its ruling the appeals court asked the
Supreme Court to ``define what is in fact a `secret document'.''
   Also on Friday a Foreign Ministry official said President Daniel
Ortega, on a 10-nation tour of Western Europe, is seeking support
for the normalization of relations between Nicaragua and the United
States.
   Manolo Cordero, director of the Foreign Ministry's North
American desk, said Ortega will ask British and West German leaders
to help persuade the Bush administration to restore normal
relations with the Sandinista government.
   Cordero told a news conference President Bush appears more
responsive to change than the Reagan administration and it is now
worthwhile to try new avenues to improve relations.
   Ortega has visited France, Belgium, Spain and Norway and plans
stops in Greece, Italy, Sweden, Ireland, West Germany and Great
Britain.
   Julio Icaza, another Foreign Ministry official, also spoke to
reporters Friday.
   He said the renewal of the U.S. trade embargo means Nicaragua
``must look for alternatives, like talks with donor governments''
at a meeting next month in Sweden.
   Last week Bush announced the embardo would be continued. He said
the left-wing Sandinista government represents ``an extraordinary
threat'' to U.S. security.
   The Reagan administration imposed the sanctions in 1985.

<HEAD>Energy Secrtary: Tritium Plant Will Be Flagship of Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH GROAT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said Friday
he hopes the idle Savannah River nuclear weapons plant will become
the ``flagship'' of the nation's nuclear facilities, even though he
has delayed reopening it.
   The Savannah River Site's three nuclear reactors, the nation's
sole source of tritium used in the production of nuclear warheads,
have been shut down for safety modifications since August.
   Watkins, in South Carolina to tour the plant, said he hoped to
announce a startup date for the reactors by July. Earlier this
week, he said he would delay resumption of production at the plant,
slated for late 1989, until at least early 1990.
   ``Until we are convinced we have the best interests of our
people at heart, the reactors will not be restarted,'' Watkins told
employees at the plant.
   The energy secretary said it was important to delay the restart
``to demonstrate to (the) American people ... that we know how to
manage nuclear technology.''
   The 330-acre plant on the Georgia border manufactures tritium, a
radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of nuclear
warheads.
   Shortly after the reactors were shut down, the department said
it could have them running again by late 1988. After that target
was missed, the department told Congress it expected startup by
late this year.
   The Pentagon warned of an imminent shortage of the vital nuclear
material, but that did not discourage Watkins from delaying the
plant's restart.
   While the nation's dwindling supply of tritium is a concern,
``it's a matter of what steps we can take. The worst thing would be
a preliminary start-up'' of the reactors, said U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Georgia, who accompanied Watkins on a morning tour of the plant.
   Watkins said he believed the Savannah River Site, once back in
operation, would become the best-run facility among the country's
nuclear weapons and power plants.
   ``I can see us emerging here as the number one plant in the
nation. That's my goal _ to have this plant be the flagship,''
Watkins told employees at a meeting in the plant's cafeteria.
   Numerous relevations surfaced about the plant last year,
prompting its shutdown. Among them were concern over accidents, lax
management and policies that stressed production over safety.
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. took over management of the plant on
April 1. Before that, it was operated and managed by chemical giant
E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., which built the plant 38 years ago.

   Right-wing military President Augusto
Pinochet said Friday he definitely will not run in the Dec. 14
presidential election, but he said he will stay on as commander of
the army.
   Gen. Pinochet, speaking at a news conference after swearing in
two new ministers to his 16-member Cabinet, also proposed limited
changes to the constitution written by the military.
   ``I feel a deep attachment to the constitution,'' Pinochet said,
explaining why he will not run for president.
   The constitution prohibits him from seeking re-election, but
several right-wing groups have insisted in recent months that a
formula be found to allow him to run.
   Pinochet himself previously hinted that he could agree. On
Tuesday, he told a group of labor leaders who asked him to run
again: ``That does not depend on me, but on you. I am prepared for
anything.''
   He stressed that he will hand power to the winner in the
December election, which he was obliged to call after voters in a
referendum last October rejected a military proposal to extend his
term until 1997.
   Pinochet said Friday that after leaving the presidency, he will
remain as commander of the army, which the constitution allows him
to do.
   ``Under the present circumstances, I think that's the position
where I can serve my country best,'' Pinochet said.
   Opposition parties and even some government supporters
repeatedly have criticized Pinochet's decision to remain head of
the army, which has been his power base since he seized power in a
violent 1973 coup.
   Critics said his continuation in the nation's top military
position would threaten the stability of the future civilian
government.
   Pinochet's decision this week to keep Interior Minister Carlos
Caceres was seen by some opposition leaders as an indication that
he was finally accepting the constitutional changes sought by
opposition and pro-government parties.
   But on Friday, he made clear that he is offering only limited
changes. At the news conference, he listed six possible amendments,
far less that those sought by the opposition.
   He said he is prepared to change an article banning Marxism, to
ease the mechanism for future constitutional changes, to drop the
presidential power to disband the lower house of Congress and to
send citizens into exile; to shorten the eight-year presidential
term, and to change the makeup of a powerful military dominated
National Security Council.
   He rejected changes sought by the opposition, including a clause
that makes nine members of the 26-member Senate appointed instead
of elected, and another that prevents the future civilian
government from firing the heads of the three branches of the armed
forces and the national police.
   Pinochet appointed Rene Salame, a chemistry teacher, to replace
Juan Guzman as education minister; and Jorge Lopez, a mining
engineer, to replace Pablo Baraona as minister of mines.

<HEAD>Britain Taking Threats Against Diplomats Seriously</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Office said Friday it is taking
seriously death threats against British diplomats in Europe in
connection with Salman Rushdie's book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Senior diplomatic officials were singled out in letters written
by a group calling itself The Defenders of Islamic Purity, a
spokesman said, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
practice.
   He said ``appropriate action'' was taken, but no details were
being revealed about people threatened or in what countries they
worked.
   Many Moslems around the world say Rushdie's novel blasphemes
Islam. The book includes a scene in which prostitutes take the
names of the prophet Mohammed's wives, and it suggests Mohammed
wrote the holy Koran, instead of receiving it from Allah.
   On Feb. 14, Iran's leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a
death sentence against Rushdie, who remains in hiding. Rushdie,
born in India of Moslem parents, now is a British citizen.
   The Brussels newspaper Libre Belgique said Friday in an article
signed by crime reporter Roger Rosart that the British Embassy in
Brussels received threats.
   An embassy spokesman in Brussels confirmed that, but said no
staff were singled out by name and no staff were moved to other
posts, reported Press Association, the British domestic news agency.
   Belgian authorities would not comment.
   Rosart said three letters from The Defenders of Islamic Purity
which came into the hands of Belgian police blamed the British
attitude in the Rushdie affair and listed British diplomats who
were to be killed soon. It said two of the letters went to the
embassy.
   The paper reported that the threats warned family and friends to
steer clear of intended victims lest they be harmed, too. It said a
large number of these diplomats either returned to Britain or were
transferred elsewhere.
   The Foreign Office spokesman said: ``Similar letters have gone
to various embassies in Europe. These threats are always taken
seriously and we have acted accordingly.''
   Libre Belgique said Belgian authorities were arranging strict
protective measures in view of the Brussels murder of Imam Abdullah
Al-Ahdal and his aide on March 29.
   Ahdal, a Saudi cleric and leader of the Moslems of Belgium,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands, was shot after receiving death
threats for opposing Khomeini's death sentence on Rushdie.
   In other Rushdie developments:
   _Iran strongly protested the showing and sale of a few copies of
``The Satanic Verses'' during Geneva's International Book Fair. A
statement issued by the Iranian Embassy in Bern on Friday said the
action violates Swiss laws calling for respect of religious beliefs
and insults the rights of more than 90,000 Moslems living in
Switzerland.
   _A judge in Caracas ruled on Thursday in favor of Venezuela's
Islamic Center, saying publication of ``The Satanic Verses''
violated religious freedom. The Islamic Center, representing
Venezuelan Moslems, had brought suit against a publisher planning
to bring out the book.

   Cambodian resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk called Friday for the dissolution of the
Vietnamese-backed government in Cambodia and said the resistance
coalition also would be dissolved.
   Sihanouk arrived in Thailand Friday to hold talks with
representatives of the three-party resistance coalition and is to
go next week to Indonesia, where he may meet with Vice President
Dan Quayle.
   Sihanouk gave no time frame for the dissolution of what he
called the ``illegal'' Cambodian government of Premier Hun Sen but
said the resistance coalition would be dissolved at the same time
``in order to let our people make all decisions on Cambodia.''
   Sihanouk is to spend three days in Thailand and then go to
Indonesia for a meeting with Hun Sen.
   Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Thursday that while
in Indonesia, Sihanouk also would meet with Quayle, who is on a
12-day tour of Australia and Southeast Asia.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978, ousted the radical
Khmer Rouge regime and set up another communist government.
   Vietnam has announced it will withdraw all of its troops from
Cambodia by Sept. 30, and that has added pressure for the Hun Sen
government and resistance leaders to reach an agreement to avoid
further bloodshed.
   The coalition includes Sihanouk supporters, an anti-communist
group and the Khmer Rouge. The strongest of the three, the Khmer
Rouge came to power in the spring of 1975 by defeating the
U.S.-backed Cambodian government and killed more than a million
Cambodians in a purge that continued until the Vitnamese invaded.
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, also in Bangkok,
said Friday that a Chinese official has declared China will halt
its military aid to the resistance groups after Vietnam completes
the troop withdrawal. Thach identified the official only as a vice
minister.
   The Soviet Union has backed Vietnam in the conflict, and China
supported the Khmer Rouge.
   Vietnam has an estimated 50,000-70,000 military personnel in
Cambodia.
   Hun Sen's government has rejected demands that it be dissolved
and has said general elections should be held after the Vietnamese
are out of the country.
   Sihanouk, who went to China after being ousted in a 1970 coup,
said in a written statement released before he arrived in Bangkok
that the Hun Sen government is ``nothing but a creation and
creature of Vietnam'' and ``has no right to organize `general
elections'.''

<HEAD>Banks, Exchange Houses Affected By Currency Shortage</HEAD>

   Financial activity slowed Friday
due to a shortage of paper money, and President Raul Alfonsin
scheduled meetings with political, business and labor leaders to
discuss solutions to the nation's economic problems.
   The Central Bank ordered a partial bank holiday late Thursday
night, explaining that a delay in delivery of imported paper to the
national mint, which prints bills, and a labor dispute at the mint
had produced a shortage of currency.
   Central Bank Vice President Roberto Eilbaum said paper had
arrived, the labor conflict had been resolved and that employees
would work over the long weekend, which includes a May 1 Labor Day
holiday, to resolve the shortage.
   Meanwhile, he said, Friday banking activity would be restricted
to the cashing of pension checks and the paychecks of public and
private employees.
   Eilbaum said no changes in economic or exchange policy were
planned and that all banks and exchange houses will open normally
on Tuesday.
   He also denied that the shortage of currency was responsible for
the strengthening of the austral, the national currency, against
the dollar in financial activity Thursday.
   The austral on Thursday gained back most of the ground it lost
during feverish devaluation earlier in the week, closing at 75 per
dollar.
   The week's fluctuations followed a two-month drop in value of
the austral and touched off price increases, the suspension of
credit card sales, and shortages of some medicines and foods.
   The fluctuations also provoked anger at the government and fear
of social unrest.
   The exchange rate on April 21 was 72 to 1; on Monday 82 to 1; on
Tuesday 96 to 1 and on Wednesday 84 to 1. The austral, worth 17 to
1 on Feb. 3, has declined in value by about 77 percent since Feb.
5, when the Central Bank allowed the currency to float, ending its
policy of using dwindling reserves to prop it up.
   Alfonsin invited presidential candidates, heads of political
parties, and business and labor union leaders to separate meetings
at the government house and the official residence to discuss the
economic crisis as well as steps to be followed during the
transition period following scheduled May 14 elections.
   Presidential spokesman Jose Ignacio Lopez told reporters
Thursday that Alfonsin had called the meetings to ``materialize
common ideas aimed at improving the economic situation, ensuring
the political transition and reassuring the population.''
   Alfonsin was expected to seek support for a series of economic
measures, including reforms in the exchange market, restraint on
government spending and possible steps to increase government
income.
   The General Confederation of Labor, the country's 4
million-member labor federation, called Thursday for immediate
payment of the ``mid-year bonus,'' a bonus equivalent to half a
month's pay that all employers are obliged to pay employees in June.
   Labor Minister Ideler Tonelli on Thursday discarded the
possibility of an immediate general wage increase, but said the
measure could be considered if it became necessary.

   Jason, the million-dollar submersible robot, was
still missing at sea Friday but its disappearance failed to sink a
$7 million high school science project.
   ``Jason's still down there, but we're optimistic,'' said Nancy
Green of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, home base to the
propeller-driven remote-control robot sunk to the bottom of the
Mediterranean Sea.
   More than 250,000 students in 13 cities in the United States and
Canada were boning up on plate tectonics and underwater volcanoes
in preparation for the start Monday of a massive satellite science
project gone slightly awry.
   On Wednesday, museums across North America were hooked up live
via satellite with the Star Hercules, a marine exploration ship
anchored over the ancient ruins of a sunken Roman trading ship off
the coast.
   As about 2,000 museum officials, teachers and technicians
watched, marine biologists began lowering the 7-foot-long robot and
its 8,000-pound mobile garage, Argo, into the ocean for a test run.
The footage was to be viewed by thousands of students during a
two-week period.
   All of a sudden, the live cameras focused in on a group of crew
members holding the severed cable that once had been Jason's
lifeline.
   In a flash, the horrible truth emerged: the million dollar robot
whose older brother nosed among the Titanic's ruins had sunk 2,100
feet to the soft, silty ocean floor.
   Green said a second consecutive day of churning seas and high
winds prevented Dr. Robert Ballard and his team of marine explorers
from sending down a second submersible to rescue its errant
predecessor.
   Paul Fontaine, coordinator for the project at Boston's Museum of
Science, said if necessary a slightly less sophisticated backup
would be used and the show would go on despite Jason's predicament.
   ``The kids won't be disappointed,'' he said. ``Even if they
can't pick him up before the project gets going, they'll just go
back and get Jason later.''
   Fontaine said the project, whose sponsors include Turner, Woods
Hole, Electronic Data Systems and the National Geographic Society,
would go on as scheduled between May 1-14.
   The participating museums are The Boston Museum of Science; the
Museum of Natural History in Denver; the Detroit Science Center;
the Discovery Place in Charlotte, N.C.; the Museum of Science and
Industry in Chicago; The Science Place in Dallas; Memphis (Tenn.)
Pink Palace Museum; The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia; the
Rochester (N.Y.) Museum and Science Center; Mote Marine Laboratory
in Sarasota, Fla.; National Geographic Society Grosvenor Auditorium
in Washington and Dallas; and the Royal British Columbia Museum in
Victoria, British Columbia.

   Security forces killed 77 leftist guerrillas
Friday in two separate attacks in the Andes Mountains and the
jungle, the government said. It was the heaviest day of fighting in
Peru's nine-year insurgency.
   Six soldiers and three university students also were killed,
officials said.
   Also Friday, the officials said more than 6,000 people were
detained in Lima in massive sweeps by police seeking the killers of
leftist congressman Eriberto Arroyo, who was slain Thursday.
   At dawn, troops spotted a column of leftist guerrillas in
uniforms near Molinos, a tiny village 35 miles north of Huancayo,
the government said in a communique.
   In fighting that followed, 62 leftist guerrillas and six
soldiers were killed and 23 soldiers were wounded, it said.
   President Alan Garcia said in a brief radio statement that the
rebels were from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, which
endorses a Cuba styled Marxism and has been active since 1984.
   Police also killed 15 Maoist Shining Path guerrillas in fighting
near Santa Rosa, a village in Peru's cocaine-producing jungle 260
miles northeast of Lima.
   The government said drug traffickers supported the rebels in the
clash, but it did not provide further details.
   The casualties Friday marked the highest number of guerrilla
deaths in any single day of fighting during the nine-year
insurgency. Thirty-four Shining Path guerrillas died earlier this
month in two battles with troops in the Amazon jungle.
   More than 900 people have died this year in political violence.
   In related violence, police said the bodies of three students
shot to death Friday by Shining Path guerrillas were found at the
University of Huancayo.
   The region around Huancayo, one of Peru's richest agricultural
zones 140 miles east of Lima, has been a growing focus of rebel
activity for the past three years.
   Both the Mao-inspired Shining Path and the smaller Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement are active in the region. The groups are not
linked.
   Analysts said the guerrillas are seeking to disrupt farming and
isolate the zone to prevent food from reaching coastal Lima,
further agravating an severe economic recession that has already
sparked temporary food shortages.
   Police said 6,407 people were arrested and 1,135 automobiles
were stopped and searched on city streets late Thursday as police
sought the killers of Arroyo, a member of the United Left Party,
the second strongest party in Congress.
   Police have blamed the Shining Path for the killing, but some
members of the United Left, a Marxist coalition, blamed the murder
on on anti-rebel death squad called the Rodrigo Franco Command.
   During previous sweeps, the vast majority of those detained have
been released after proving their identities.
   Analysts said the spreading violence, coupled with Peru's
deepest economic recession of the century, has fomented political
instability and social chaos that have become a threat to Peru's
democracy.
   The Shining Path has been fighting since 1980 to topple the
government.
   The violence has claimed more than 14,000 lives, including
soldiers, police, guerrillas and non-combantants. But most of the
dead have been highland peasants caught in the cross-fire between
government forces and guerrillas.

   An 18-month-old girl
died Friday from wounds suffered in the bombing of the
Dominican-American Cultural Institute. Left-wing activists
demonstrated outside the U.S. Embassy.
   Police said Hayde Sanchez Rodriguez was in the institute's
nursery and suffered head wounds in the pipe-bomb explosion
Thursday.
   They said no individual or group has asserted responsiblity for
the bombing of the center, operated jointly by the U.S. and
Dominican governments.
   Groups from five left-wing political groups, led by the
Communist Party, organized the demonstration at the U.S. Embassy on
the 24th anniverasy of the U.S. military intervention in the
Dominican Republic.
   About 50 demonstrators were barred from approaching the embassy
gate by an equal number of riot police. Some demonstrators trampled
on a U.S. flag but there was no violence.
   A statement issued by the demonstration organizers said, ``On
the occasion of another anniversary of the American military
intervention as Dominicans we have the obligation to protest
against this aggression against our sovereignty.''
   Police and military units were assigned to guard the U.S.
Embassy and Consulate and residences of U.S. diplomats. Officials
said 4,000 policemen were reinforcing regular street patrols.
   The elected government of President Juan Bosch was ousted by a
military coup in September 1963, and the armed forces established a
governing junta that ruled until April 1965 when civil war broke
out.
   The United States sent troops into the Caribbean Island on April
28, 1965. Those units were incorporated later into an
inter-American peace force sponsored by the Organization of
American States, and it imposed a truce.
   Elections were held in June 1966, and Joaquin Balaguer defeated
Bosch.

<HEAD>Services Set Saturday For Federal Judge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Funeral services are scheduled Saturday for
controversial U.S. District Judge Stephen S. Chandler, who went
into semi-retirement 14 years ago after a stormy 32-year career on
the bench.
   Chandler died Thursday at age 89 after a short bout with
pneumonia and a long battle with a bleeding ulcer, his family said.
He had been hospitalized about two weeks.
   Chandler was born Sept. 13, 1899, in Tennessee. He received his
law degree from the University of Kansas in 1922 and was a private
attorney in Oklahoma City when President Franklin Roosevelt put him
on the federal bench in 1943.
   Chandler often feuded with other federal judges. In 1962, he
testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee that he was afraid of
being poisoned, that his telephone was tapped and that his fellow
judges sometimes cursed him.
   Twice he was removed from hearing multi-million-dollar lawsuits
because of alleged personal interest or alleged bias and prejudice.
He was indicted by a state grand jury in 1965 for allegedly
conspiring to have a road on property he owned paved by the county.
The criminal charge later was dismissed.
   In 1965, the 10th Circuit Judicial Council stripped him of his
powers for a month, contending he was ``unable or unwilling to
discharge efficiently the duties of his office.''
   He was embroiled in a libel suit with one attorney and once
disbarred the U.S. attorney and five other federal attorneys in
Oklahoma City from practicing in the federal court.
   A state court once ordered Chandler to pay a $50,000 libel
judgment to an attorney the judge accused of a $1 million fraud in
a bankruptcy case. The verdict was overturned in federal appeals
courts.
   In 1974, Chandler disbarred U.S. Attorney William Burkett, four
of Burkett's assistants and an Internal Revenue Service lawyer from
practicing in the federal courts of western Oklahoma. The judge
contended the attorneys were illegally hiding a witness in a case
involving then Gov. David Hall.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Chandler's
order eight months later.
   Chandler offered to retire in 1973, but only if he could name
his successor.
   When Chandler announced in May 1975 that he would take senior
status at age 75, President Gerald Ford accepted his letter of
retirement in a matter of hours. Judicial retirement formalities
usually take up to a month.
   As a senior judge, Chandler was still eligible to hear cases,
but his caseload was greatly reduced.
   Chandler was chairman of the Judicial Administration of the
American Bar Association in 1959-60, and was on the governing
council of the Inter-American Bar Association, 1956-1973.
   In 1960 he was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame. From
1960-63 he was professor of law at Oklahoma City University.
   He married Margaret Patterson, now deceased, in 1922. He is
survived by a daughter and two sons.

<HEAD>Young Father's Desperate Act Draws Sympathy, Compassion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cards, calls and compassion were pouring in
Friday for the desperate young father who held hospital workers at
gunpoint as he removed his comatose baby son from life-support
systems and held him till he died.
   Rudy Linares, 23, a house painter from west suburban Cicero,
faces first-degree murder charges in the death early Wednesday of
his 16-month-old son, Samuel.
   ``I would fly to Chicago tomorrow .... and do anything I could
to help this guy because I feel that there but for the grace of God
go I,'' Michael Killigrew, parent of a brain-damaged child, said
from Nevada City, Calif.
   Samuel had been in a coma, partially brain dead, since he
swallowed a balloon at an Aug. 2 birthday party, blocking the flow
of oxygen to his brain.
   The toddler was considered to be in a ``irreversible vegetative
coma,'' says Dr. Gilbert Goldman, Samuel's physician at pediatric
intensive care at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center.
   Goldman has said he did not believe he could legally comply with
the family's request months ago for withdrawal of life support
though he was ``personally and professionally sympathetic.''
   Under state child-abuse laws, support could be withdrawn only if
Samuel had been found to be totally brain-dead or his heart and
lungs had stopped functioning, said Max Brown, a lawyer for the
hospital.
   The family had planned to see a lawyer Friday to discuss their
options.
   ``This is something that should not be the choice of government,
it's a private individual's choice,'' Killigrew said in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press.
   When his 17-month-old daughter, Claudia, suffered severe brain
damage from a 1970 case of spinal meningitis, Killigrew said a
sympathetic doctor allowed him ``agonizing choice'' of letting her
go, rather than prolonging treatment.
   Linares told reporters: ``I did it because I love my son.''
Assistant Public Defender Richard Scholz has said his client will
plead innocent.
   Linares is free on a $75,000 recognizance bond but was ordered
Thursday by Cook County Judge Robert Bastone to undergo a
psychiatric examination to determine whether he ``is any danger to
himself or anyone else.''
   Public defender Philip Mullane told the court Linares took
matters in his own hands after a nurse left a message on the
family's answering machine that said Samuel was to be moved ``to a
long-care residential facility to die.''
   Hospital officials, however, said the message made no reference
to the child's being ``transferred to die'' and was left only after
repeated attempts to reach the Linares and his 21-year-old wife,
Tamara, had failed.
   Mullane said the baby's funeral is scheduled Monday at an
undisclosed location.
   Residents of the Linares' working-class neighborhood said they
had received so many calls offering financial help for the family
that they plan to set up a fund at a Cicero bank to help cover
medical bills and other expenses.

<HEAD>Stalin To Disappear From China's Central Square</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge portrait of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin
is to be banished from China's main square this May Day, just two
weeks before Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev's ceremonial
welcome on the same square.
   Communist Party spokeswoman Yue Yanghua said Saturday that for
the first time in three decades, portraits of Stalin, Lenin, Marx
and Engels will not appear for May Day, a major labor holiday in
China and other socialist nations.
   Yue said the only portrait to appear on Tiananmen Square this
year and in the future will be that of Sun Yatsen, founder of the
first Chinese republic.
   She said authorities decided only pictures of Chinese historical
figures should be shown on the square. Mao Tse-tung's portrait
hangs permanently from atop Tiananmen Gate, at the entrance to the
Forbidden City.
   Yue denied the decision was linked to a reappraisal of Stalin's
historical role as Soviet historians acknowledge Stalin was
responsible for political repression, murderous purges and economic
disasters.
   In the past decade of economic reforms, China rejected Stalinist
state planning and one-man rule, but still recognizes Stalin's role
in the early history of the Chinese Communist Party.
   Portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Sun have decorated the
square every May Day and on China's Oct. 1 National Day since the
1950s.
   Stalin's picture was added in the late 1950s, several years
after his death and at a time when Chinese-Soviet relations were
deteriorating because of differences between Mao and Nikita
Khrushchev.
   Gorbachev's May 15-18 visit will be the first since Khrushchev
was in Beijing in 1959 and will normalize political relations after
30 years of hostility.

<HEAD>Defense Secretary Says Gorbachev Reforms Will ``Ultimately Fail''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in an
interview Friday he expects Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's
reforms to ``ultimately fail'' and that Gorbachev will be replaced
by anti-Western leader.
   ``My personal view is that the task he set for himself to trying
to fundamentally reform the Soviet system is incapable of
occuring,'' Cheney said in the interview taped for broadcast
Saturday on CNN's ``Evans &amp; Novak'' program.
   ``If I had to guess today, I would guess that he would
ultimately fail,'' Cheney said.
   Cheney suggested in the interview that the Soviet leader's
political survival hinges on the success of the economic and
political reforms he has instigated.
   ``That is to say, that he will not be able to reform the Soviet
economy ... And when that happens, he's likely to be replaced by
somebody who will be far more hostile than he's been in terms of
his attitude towards the West,'' Cheney said.
   His comments followed closely the answers he gave a
congressional committee earlier this week when asked about the Bush
administration's proposed reductions in the Pentagon budget. Cheney
told the House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday there is ``a
very real likelihood'' Gorbachev's reforms would fail and that he
would either have to change course or hand over power.
   He said in the interview that the Pentagon cutbacks announced
Tuesday, which included delays in several weapons programs, are not
part of an overall plan to scale back Western defenses because of
Gorbachev's peaceful overtures.
   ``He could modify his policies and have to accomodate a more
conservative line,'' he said of Gorbachev. ``He could conceivably
be replaced. The point is, we don't know.''

   A convicted murderer freed from a Florida prison
after asserting his innocence for 21 years, visited the tomb of
Martin Luther King Jr. on Friday and vowed to work to help troubled
young people.
   James Richardson, sentenced to death in 1968 in the poisoning
deaths of his seven children, won his freedom Tuesday after a judge
ruled that his murder trial was tainted by prosecutorial misconduct.
   He has insisted he did not kill the children, who ate a prepared
lunch tainted with the pesticide parathion, and sworn affidavits
implicated the family's baby sitter as a suspect.
   Richardson, flanked by civil rights activists, spoke to
reporters at the King Center in Atlanta, telling the dramatic tale
of his near-execution and his years in prison.
   ``I've seen things you never thought in your whole life,'' he
said, describing how he saw young inmates raped and brutalized by
other prisoners.
   ``I want to get started on things I've wanted to do to help,''
he said, adding that he hopes to work with alcoholics and young
people. ``So many of our young people are going to prison. ... They
don't need this. I want to tell our young generation to get
themselves together.''
   Activist Dick Gregory said Richardson, who underwent open-heart
surgery in prison, will join the staff of the Dick Gregory Diet and
Health Resort at Fort Walton Beach, Fla., encouraging other heart
patients to stay healthy.
   Friday evening, Richardson and Gregory arrived in Fort Walton
Beach.
   ``I feel pretty good so far,'' Richardson told reporters. ``I
haven't made any plans at this time but to be with Mr. Dick
Gregory. I think it's going to be wonderful.''
   Richardson is to spend the weekend at the clinic. Gregory has
offered a $100,000-a-year job at the diet clinic to the 53-year-old
former orange picker, who has until June 1 to decide on a contract,
said Richardson attorney Ellis Rubin.
   Richardson also will work with the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference in its programs against drug and alcohol abuse and will
counsel prison inmates, Gregory said, praising Richardson for his
loving attitude.
   ``I cannot believe that this man ... is not bitter,'' Gregory
said. ``If he was bitter, I could sympathize with him, but I
wouldn't hire him.''
   Richardson sat before King's tomb and sang out the words on the
slain civil rights leader's crypt: ``Free at last, free at last,
thank God almighty, I'm free.'' Richardson used the same words on
the first full day of his release.
   SCLC President Joseph Lowery said Richardson's case
``underscores and affirms, again and again, the argument against
the death penalty. One of the damnable things about the death
penalty is you cannot correct a mistake. He would be dead.''
   Richardson's death sentence was commuted to a life term in 1972
after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the nation's capital
punishment laws.
   Rubin said Richardson, his wife and daughter have authorized him
to seek compensation from those responsible for imprisoning
Richardson, a step that must be taken before the state Legislature
could consider a relief bill to award damages.

   The launch of Atlantis was scrubbed
Friday less than a minute before its planned liftoff when
controllers detected an electrical surge in a main engine fuel
pump. Five astronauts were on board, along with a robot probe that
NASA is sending to Venus.
   ``We're disappointed we couldn't go today, but we're satisfied
with the checks and balances inherent in the launch system,'' said
mission commander David Walker. ``We are prepared to go as soon as
the bird is fixed, and we are confident it will be done quickly and
safely.''
   Launch director Bob Sieck said it will be at least Monday before
a second launch attempt can be made, and he termed that timetable
``optimistic'' after revealing that NASA was also checking on an
unexpected ``vapor cloud'' that emerged around a hydrogen fuel line.
   Among tens of thousands who gathered for the rare afternoon
liftoff were some of the country's most renowned planetary
scientists. They have been waiting to resume solar system
exploration since 1978, when Pioneer-Venus was launched on the last
U.S. planetary expedition.
   ``That's just the way it is,'' shrugged James Head, a geologist
from Brown University following the postponement. ``We've got a
nice long launch window,'' he said, noting NASA has until May 28 to
get Magellan on its way.
   ``We have waited a number of years for this flight, and a few
extra days won't matter,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief
scientist. ``The window is a month long. Having the shuttle ready
on the first day is ample time to solve the problem and get us on
our way to Venus.''
   Sieck said NASA probably would not understand the precise cause
of the problem until inspecting the spacecraft over the weekend. He
also said technicians, reviewing film, discovered that a troubling
vapor cloud appeared around a fuel line towards the end of the
countdown.
   He said it could be ``well into next week,'' if NASA has to
replace the pump or the fuel line. For a Monday launch, ``Both of
them would have to fall into a quick fix, and it would be
optimistic to expect that.''
   The postponement set back NASA's plan to eject its robot
Magellan spacecraft out of the shuttle, toward Venus. The
$550-million Magellan mission would revitalize NASA's unmanned
space science program.
   Atlantis' astronauts were strapped in and the countdown was
advancing toward a launch, less than a minute to go, when a
controller detected something wrong on a monitor and informed
Sieck: ``Possible problem with an engine 1 recirculation pump ...
recommend hold at T-31 seconds.''
   Launch commentator Hugh Harris quickly reported, ``There is not
enough time to recycle and launch today.''
   The pump circulates liquid hydrogen to keep fuel lines cool
before engine ignition.
   Keith Hodkins, director of NASA's Orbiter Division, said that 50
seconds before the planned launch, monitors detected a sudden power
surge reading of 21 amps on the pump's electrical circuitry.
Normal, he said, is 2 to 3 amps.
   ``The spike tripped the circuitry,'' forcing a shutown, Hodkins
said.
   Harris had said, ``The problem may not be in the pump at all. It
might be in ground support equipment or somewhere in the orbiter.''
   ``If the fixes are simple, we can maintain the possibility of a
Monday afternoon launch,'' he said. ``If we have to replace the
pump or the (fuel) line, we could go well into next week.''
   Harris said the first goal of the launch team was to ``get the
crew safely out of there'' by making certain all systems were
stable. The astronauts reset switches in the cabin before taking
the elevator to the base of the pad for a trip back to their crew
quarters.
   The astronauts _ Walker, pilot Ronald Grabe and mission
specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard _ returned to
crew quarters.
   NASA had set Atlantis' liftoff between 2:24 p.m. and 2:47 p.m.,
a narrow window dictated by the need to deploy the Magellan payload
from a precise location above the Earth and a requirement that the
shuttle go before darkness fell at emergency landing sites in Spain
and Morocco.
   The space agency must send Magellan on its way between April 28
and May 28 because that is when Earth and Venus are in proper
alignment. If the spacecraft cannot be launched by the end of May,
officials would have to wait two years before the two planets again
are in the desired position.
   The countdown had been almost flawless until the last minute.
The only snag was a problem with a range-safety tracking computer
that set back the count six minutes.
   ``All systems were ready to support a launch until we hit that
unexpected problem,'' Harris said.
   When Atlantis is launched, the astronauts are to release
Magellan from the cargo bay and start it on a 450-day,
806-million-mile journey to Venus. It will be the first U.S.
planetary flight in 11 years.
   The 7,600-pound spacecraft is to loop into orbit around Venus in
August 1990 and map up to 90 percent of the surface with a
high-resolution radar system that will pierce the planet's sulfuric
acid clouds.
   The photos could disclose much about the history of Venus and
why it evolved so differently than its sister planet Earth, even
though scientists believe they were almost identical at the
formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago.

<TEXT>
   Several days of storms washed oil off
Alaska beaches and back into Prince William Sound, but
concentrations are far lighter than in the first weeks after the
Exxon Valdez oil spill, an official said Friday.
   ``We're seeing sheens that are almost solely associated with
rewashing,'' said Jerry Galt of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration after several storms brought the cleanup
to a standstill for three days.
   Most of the oil remained off Eleanor Island in the center of the
sound, Galt said. The concentrations, however, are nothing like
they were two weeks after the tanker ran aground.
   ``It's heavy only in a relative sense,'' he said. ``Compared to
what we were seeing two weeks ago, three weeks ago, it's quite
light.''
   But Bill Lamoreaux of the Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation said the bad weather was a disadvantage because it
hindered clean-up operations.
   ``Both of us are reflecting something realistic,'' said
Lamoreaux, DEC's coordinator of the spill effort. Stormy weather
can have a a favorable effect, but ongoing clean-up work remains
essential, he said.
   Lamoreaux said the state's aerial surveys show a number of areas
where oil appears sufficiently concentrated for effective skimming.
   The storms washed oil off some beaches and back into the
fish-rich sound, where grey whales migrating north stop over every
summer and where pregnant seals soon will haul out to have their
pups.
   The weather kept skimming operations to a minimum on the Gulf of
Alaska. Parts of the sound had very rough seas, including the
waters around Smith Island where the USS Juneau is anchored with
343 cleanup workers.
   Exxon and the Coast Guard said workers wouldn't leave the ship
because of rough seas and winds in excess of 30 mph were reported
Friday.
   In other developments:
   _The attorney for Capt. Joseph Hazelwood told the Anchorage
Daily News that the Exxon Valdez's skipper wasn't trying to free
his ship from the reef as taped conversations between the ship and
the Coast Guard seem to indicate. Some officials had worried that
Hazelwood risked breaking the ship on the reef.
   Michael Chalos of New York said his client was trying ``to keep
the vessel on the ledge'' and that Hazelwood was ``concerned about
coming off the ledge and possibly capsizing or breaking up.''
   The tapes seem to contradict Chalos.
   Hazelwood told the Coast Guard an hour after the ship ran
aground that ``We're in pretty good shape now, stability-wise, and,
ah, trying to extract her off the shoal here. Once we get under way
I'll let you know.''
   _Gov. Steve Cowper accused Exxon of misleading the public with a
campaign of ``tall tales'' aimed at shifting blame for the slow
response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill to the state.
   Cowper said Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl's repeated statements
that the state refused to approve the use of chemical dispersants
soon after the spill were ``demonstrably false.''
   The statements have been repeated in the national news media and
by federal officials, including Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan,
giving them increased credibility, Cowper said.
   ``If an untrue statement continues to be repeated time after
time after time after time, and you don't make an effort to refute
that statement, then people will believe it like it was gospel.
Obviously, that's happening now,'' he said.
   ``The fact is Exxon did not have the capability to carry out any
kind of oil recovery that was very effective,'' Dennis Kelso, the
state's chief environmentalist said.
   Rawl fired back at the governor late Friday, accusing him in
turn of spreading wrong information.
   In a letter to Cowper, a copy of which was obtained by The
Associated Press, Rawl said Exxon had enough dispersants on hand
and en route to ``contain the spill and significantly mitigate the
impact of the oil on the shoreline.''
   An Anchorage mountain climber, meanwhile, took his own protest
to an eight-story office building in Anchorage where Exxon has
offices.
   Anchorage police said Michael A. Tumey climbed out on the roof
of the building and rappelled down, stopping at about the fourth
floor to attach a banner that read: ``Oil Spilled, Exxon Kills,
Remember The Sound.''
   When he completed his descent, Tumey was arrested on trespassing
charges but not before he pulled a dead, oily seabird from his
backpack to show the gathered cameramen, photographers and small
crowd.

<HEAD>Timber Industry Owly About Talking With `Enviros' Over Threatened
Species</HEAD>

   Timber industry officials angrily accused
environmentalists Friday of using threats against the spotted owl
as a propaganda ``hoax,'' and promised to mount a national effort
to preserve forest lands for logging.
   The statements at a news conference appeared to dampen efforts
by members of the Northwest's congressional delegation and
environmentalists to negotiate a way to protect both logging jobs
and the endangered owl.
   Prodded by environmentalists, the federal Fish and Wildlife
Service this week recommended listing the Northern spotted owl,
which inhabits forests from northern Washington to northern
California, as a ``threatened'' species.
   That would involve preserving a large number of acres of
old-growth forest for the approximately 1,500 breeding pairs of
owls left. Each pair would require as much as 2,200 acres under a
draft Forest Service plan.
   Industry officials, however, contend that action could result in
as many as 280,000 job layoffs. Losses could reach $6.2 billion in
payrolls, $900 million in payments to local counties and $3 billion
in timber receipts to the federal treasury, said the National
Forest Products Association.
   ``It's warfare between the preservationists and the industry,''
said Bill Pickell of the Washington Contract Loggers Association.
He accused ``enviros'' of using the spotted owl issue to bring
logging in old growth forests to a halt.
   ``By the time all these studies (on owl populations) are done,
five years from now, I think we'll find that this is the biggest
hoax that's ever been pulled on the American public,'' he said.
   ``But by that time if these (timberland) set-asides are allowed
to continue, the devastation to the industry and the Northwest
economy will be equivalent to that Hiroshima bomb.''
   Gus Kuehne, director of the Northwest Independent Forest
Manufacturers, said the industry was forming a national group
called the American Forest Resource Alliance.
   He said it would battle environmentalist efforts to make inroads
against logging in all areas of the country, and would back up
industry efforts to seek federal legislation designating lands for
logging.
   Kuehne said the industry would only sit down to the negotiating
table over the spotted owl issue as part of national talks pitting
environmental issues against timber issues.
   The forest industry officials' estimates of damage to the timber
industry were disputed by Jean Durning of the Wilderness Society's
office in Seattle.
   ``I am distressed with the exaggerated claims ... of job losses
and money losses to the economy that the industry has been
making,'' she said.
   She said a society report last fall concluded that only 2,300
jobs would be lost over the next 40 years if significant stands of
old-growth timber were set aside to save the owls. At the same
time, she said, 26,500 jobs would be lost due to mill modernization.
   ``Conservationists recognize that achieving a healthy economy
for the Northwest's timber-dependent area is part of the picture by
which we will also achieve protection for ancient forests,'' she
said.
   The news conference followed a meeting between Reps. Al Swift,
D-Wash., and Sid Morrison, R-Wash., and more than two dozen
representatives of the timber industry.
   Both congressmen expressed hope that the differing sides could
begin meetings to resolve the owl issue.
   ``I think it's essential to work with them and see what we can
come up with,'' said Morrison.
   However, many at the meeting expressed doubt the industry could
make any headway against the environmentalists' position, noting
that court decisions have locked up some owl habitat forestlands,
at least temporarily.

   A Miami-bound American airliner carrying 147 West
German and Austrian vacationers was evacuated Friday when its
undercarriage caught fire as the plane was taxiing at Stansted
airport near London, officials said.
   They said one unidentified man received minor head injuries as
he slid down an emergency escape chute from the DC-8 of the Pegasus
Holidays company.
   Airport managing director Allan Munds said the passengers and
seven crew ``were never in any danger.''
   The plane had landed to refuel on a flight from Vienna and was
taxiing to the runway for takeoff when two tires burst and flames
blazed up.
   The passengers were taken to hotels to await a replacement
airliner due Saturday, an Independent TV News broadcast said.

   Thousands of students screaming
``Yankee go home!'' fought riot police at five universities in
Seoul Friday after authorities banned them from marching to the
border with communist North Korea to press for national unification.
   Police officials said injuries occurred, but they had no figures.
   In the southeastern industrial cities of Changwon and Masan,
about 6,000 striking workers hurling rocks and firebombs tangled
with police for a fifth day, police said.
   Strikers in Changwon poured oil on streets and set them afire,
and protesters in Masan used slingshots to pelt police with pieces
of scrap metal, they said. About 20 workers were arrested.
   Student and dissident groups are trying to unite with workers to
build an anti-government alliance.
   Government leaders are concerned about the growing labor unrest
and a wave of increasingly violent strikes for more pay and
improved working conditions.
   Police arrested 20 student delegates as they tried to reach the
border to meet with North Korean counterparts. The students wanted
to discuss taking part in an international youth festival in the
north's capital of Pyongyang in July, and ways to unite the two
Korean states.
   At Seoul National University, black police vans armed with
multiple launchers fired hundreds of tear gas rounds into the ranks
of 4,000 students fighting officers with wooden clubs, pipes and
firebombs while trying to march out of the campus. Fighting flared
around the sprawling campus in southern Seoul, with about 3,000
riot police surrounding the school.
   Hundreds of students fought police on at least four other Seoul
campuses.
   Student clashes also broke out in the southern port of Pusan and
radicals seized a government prosecutors' office in Taegu,
according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Student leaders lashed out at South Korean President Roh Tae-woo
and the United States in rallies before the clashes, accusing them
of perpetuating the division of the Korean peninsula, split into
communist north and capitalist south after World War II.
   Also Friday, about 3,400 police officers tendered resignations
en masse to protest an alleged assault on a police superintendent
by an opposition lawmaker in Changwon the previous day. National
Assemblyman Sim Wan-koo was reported to have slapped the
suprintendent in the face during a labor protest.
   National Police Director Jo Chong-suk appealed for restraint and
returned the resignations.
   Reports said Sim and four other opposition lawmakers, in
Changwon to look into labor unrest, became infuriated when police
arrested a union leader they escorted. The man had been sought by
police for unlawful labor activity.

   Three South African officials implicated in
secretly acquiring British Blowpipe missile parts from Northern
Ireland extremists were ordered to leave France by May 2, the
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
   The official announcement did not identify the three but said
they were attached to the South African Embassy in Paris, with
partial diplomatic immunity.
   Ambassador Hendrik Geldenhuys was summoned and told the
officials were expelled because of ``activities contrary to their
status,'' it said.
   A French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
three included Daniel Storm, the man caught receiving British-made
ground-to-air missile parts from three Protestant extremists of the
Ulster Resistance.
   Police arrested Storm, the three extremists and an American
businessman on April 21 after an investigation by French
counterespionage agents and British secret services.
   Storm was released because of his embassy role, but the other
four were held on gun-running and conspiracy charges, police said.
   In Britain, Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe accused South
Africa of trying to steal British missile secrets in exchange for
arms to Northern Ireland.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed ``grave concern'' to
visiting South African Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis, the
Foreign Office said.

   Only eight of the 14 winners in the
record $115 million Pennsylvania Super 7 lottery had put in claims
by Friday, one of whom said she spent a day in a motel because she
``just needed some time to sit.''
   By Friday afternoon, the holders of the eight tickets had
checked in at lottery headquarters, and officials said two other
claimants had contacted them. Four winning tickets were not
accounted for.
   The lucky few, meanwhile, savored their fortune and spun
fantasies about the future that no longer seemed so fantastic.
   Arthur and Judy Rosen arrived from East Windsor, N.J., with
their sons, Jay, 25, and Paul, 23, and a daughter, Deborah, 20.
They bought 80 tickets for the Wednesday night drawing.
   Arthur Rosen, 50, said he tried something Friday he had never
done before: ``I lit a cigarette with a dollar bill.''
   Paul Rosen, a former magician who is now a restaurant manager in
Lawrenceville, N.J., said he wants to spend some of the winnings on
the grave of magician Harry Houdini in New York City.
   ``I've had a dream for a long time to refurbish his grave and
fix it up,'' he said.
   Sylvia Trapuzzano, 35, of Washington, Pa., arrived Friday with
her fiance, father, two brothers and a sister and brother-in-law
after waiting a day at a Harrisburg area motel.
   ``I just needed some time to sit there,'' she told reporters.
``I was shocked and I couldn't believe it.''
   Trapuzzano, a sales representative, said she had kept the
winning ticket ``in a little baggie. I carried it around with me.''
   Miss Trapuzzano said her father, Ben, had bought five tickets
each for his children after she was unable to buy her own because
of long lines.
   James and Jalinda Whittle Jr. of New Brighton, Pa., and Mary
Jane Hicks, 74, of Lebanon, Pa., reached lottery headquarters
within five minutes of each other shortly before 4 p.m. EDT.
   Mrs. Hicks, a widow, said she talked to her dog when she learned
she had a big winner in her stack of 15 tickets. ``He smiled,'' she
said.
   Lottery Executive Director Jim Scroggins said the individual
ticket validation will take until next week and the first checks
will be presented then.
   The 14 jackpot tickets, each with seven winning numbers, are
worth $8.3 million over 26 years, or $317,524.67 a year before
taxes. Tickets with six winning numbers pay $4,842.50 and five
winning numbers, $274.50. Tickets with four winning numbers pay $7.
   Also claiming a jackpot ticket were three West Virginia
University maintenance workers: James Evans, 40; John Gardner, 38;
and Lionel Herndon, 40, along with Herndon's wife, Connie, 39.
   In 1984, Herndon was electrically shocked on the job and was on
disability before returning to a lower level job at half pay. He
said his first reaction to winning was fear.
   ``If you got $100 million, you'd better be worried. We got the
kids out of the house. Basically, we just left,'' Herndon said.
   He said he was relieved to share the prize. His ticket,
potentially worth $317,524 a year for 26 years, will be split three
ways.
   Two couples from the Erie area also put in a claim for a single
ticket. They were Charles J. and Kathy Davis of McKean Township and
John and Rose White of Wesleyville.
   Davis, 34, and White, 42, learned of their potential win at
their $35,000-a-year jobs at General Electric. They said they did a
victory dance.
   White said he called his wife at Alliance Plastics, telling her:
```Walk out, quit, you're done! We hit the big one! We're
millionaires!' She didn't believe me. She found out when she got
home.''
   Mrs. White, 41, said she usually worked seven days a week for
about $6 an hour at what is now her former job. She said she wants
a new car to replace the 1979 model her husband gave away to a
friend after he learned of the big win.
   The Whites said they will take their daughter, son and four
grandchildren for a trip to Disney World.
   A group of 14 workers from the Windham, Ohio, area and three
family members from western Pennsylvania and New York also claimed
single tickets Thursday.

<HEAD>Six Kuwaiti Tankers Deflagged by United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The United States and Kuwait agreed to
remove the American flag from six Kuwait-owned oil tankers that
sailed under U.S. protection during the Iraq-Iran war in the
Persian Gulf, officials said Friday.
   The decision, announced by the U.S. Maritime Administration in
Washington, ended two months of deadlock between U.S. and Kuwaiti
officials over what had been assumed to be a routine matter when
first announced last February.
   According to official sources in the gulf and in Washington, the
Kuwaitis objected to a U.S. legal provision stipulating that even
after the vessels reverted to Kuwaiti registry, the United States
would retain the right to requisition them for use in a national
emergency.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Kuwaiti
officials rejected such a condition as infringing on Kuwaiti
sovereignty.
   They said the two sides finally agreed that the tankers would be
returned to Kuwait's Finance Ministry rather than to the Kuwait Oil
Tanker Co., which actually operates them.
   Although the tanker company is wholly government-owned, the
sources said, U.S. officials deemed the distinction sufficient for
a waiver of Kuwait's obligation to make the ships available to
America.
   Walter Oates, a spokesman for the U.S. Maritime Administration,
said he could not comment other than to say the agreement became
effective as of Thursday. Kuwaiti officials were not available to
comment.
   The six ships include two petrolem product tankers and four
identical liquefied gas carriers. They were among 11 Kuwait-owned
tankers reflagged by the United States in mid-1987, entitling them
to U.S. naval escort.
   Iran at that time was attacking Kuwaiti shipping because of
Kuwait's support for Iraq in the war. Hostilities ended last Aug.
20 with a U.N.-mediated cease-fire.
   Kuwait had set up a new company, the Chesapeake Shipping Co., of
Dover, Del., as ostensible U.S. owners of the tankers. Chesapeake
will ``sell'' the six ships back to Kuwait in a transaction
existing only on paper, the sources said.
   The other five tankers will continue to fly the Stars and
Stripes, at least until next February, on condition that
all-American crews replace the regular crews during that period.
   At the time of the reflagging in 1987, the Reagan administration
waived a U.S. law requiring U.S.-flagged ships to have all-American
crews.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Meese Associate Was Wedtech's Mole in Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal prosecutor promised Friday that
evidence would paint ``a dark picture of greed'' at the
racketeering trial of E. Robert Wallach, the ex-lawyer of former
Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   In his opening statement to the jury, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Baruch Weiss said Wallach and two other defendants had turned the
now-defunct Wedtech Corp. into ``a vehicle for their own personal
financial gain.''
   But a defense attorney countered later that the bulk of the
government's case was based on the testimony of corrupt ex-Wedtech
executives with ``a history of deceiving and lying.''
   Wallach, ex-Meese financial adviser W. Franklyn Chinn and
Chinn's business associate, R. Kent London, are charged in a
21-count racketeering indictment with taking more than $1 million
from the one-time defense contractor in phony consultants' fees and
payoffs _ including $525,000 allegedly paid to Wallach to influence
Meese and other government officials.
   Weiss said Wallach, 57, of San Francisco, had gone to law school
with Meese and they were ``very close friends.''
   Wallach, who expected to get a high government job after Meese
became attorney general in the Reagan administration, had a secret
agreement with Wedtech, Weiss said.
   ``Wallach, in effect, agreed to be Wedtech's mole in the federal
government,'' he added.
   Wallach's lawyer, Gary Naftalis, conceded that Wallach and Meese
were good friends but he called them ``a political odd couple''
because Meese was a staunch conservative while Wallach was ``a
bleeding heart liberal.''
   The lawyer attacked former Wedtech officials, who already have
pleaded guilty to corruption charges and will testify for the
government.
   Naftalis claimed Wallach was as much a victim of the greed and
dishonesty of Wedtech executives as were investors and employees.
   Wallach ``fell for the Wedtech dream hook, line and sinker,''
said the defense lawyer.
   Once a small South Bronx machine shop, Wedtech grew into a $100
million government contractor through a special Small Business
Administration program that set aside contracts without competitive
bidding for minority-controlled companies.
   In previous cases, prosecutors have maintained that Wedtech
continued to receive the no-bid contracts even after it ceased
being a minority-owned company, through a series of bribes to
numerous officials.
   Meese was never charged with any criminal activities, although
his ethics were questioned by a special prosecutor in Washington
who said Meese could have been hit with tax and
conflict-of-interest charges.
   Meese is expected to testify at the trial at federal court in
Manhattan.
   Wallach and Chinn, 47, of San Francisco, and London, 46, who
divides his time between San Francisco and Hawaii, all face maximum
20-year sentences if convicted of racketeering, the most serious
charges.
   Former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., his son, and four others
were convicted last summer of corruption charges that they turned
Wedtech into a racketeering enterprise. Former White House aide Lyn
Nofziger was convicted last year of illegal lobbying on behalf of
Wedtech.
   Others convicted in Wedtech-related cases include two former
Maryland legislators, two New York area Teamsters officials, the
former commander of the New York State National Guard and a former
Postal Service official in Baltimore.
   U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., is awaiting trial on charges
that he extorted $185,000 in cash and a diamond and emerald
necklace from Wedtech.

   Vice President Dan Quayle said Saturday
the U.S.-Australia alliance is stronger than ever despite a flap
over American grain subsidies.
   ``I came here with expectations...these expectations have been
surpassed,'' Quayle told reporters at his second news conference
since arriving in Australia four days ago.
   The U.S. vice president was flying to the Great Barrier Reef on
Saturday to do some snorkeling before heading for Indonesia on
Sunday.
   Quayle's trip has been marked by criticism from Australian
officials over the United States' Export Enhancement Program, which
provides subsidies to U.S. grain growers.
   The Australians say the subsidy program has cut into their
exports to other markets although Quayle maintained during his
four-day visit here that it was aimed at countering only Europe's
protectionist policies.
   Asked if the debate over exports had hurt the alliance, Quayle
said, ``I don't believe we have angered the Australian government.''
   Overall, he said, the two countries share a common strategy of
opening markets around the world and eliminating trade restrictions.
   However, Quayle acknowledged his trip had provided him an
education on the issue.
   ``I am far more sensitive to that issue than before I came,'' he
said at the conference held in the Sydney Opera House.
   Quayle said he was ``impressed by the directness of the
Australian people'' and liked their approach in addressing him ``by
my first name.''
   ``Personally I enjoy candor,'' he said.
   Another issue that has come up during Quayle's visit was the
status of the Australian-New Zealand-U.S. military alliance known
as ANZUS.
   New Zealand's Prime Minister David Lange has indicated his
country might formally leave the pact.
   But Quayle said that alliance ``is stronger than ever,'' too,
despite a virtual freeze in relations between the United States and
New Zealand over New Zealand's anti-nuclear stance. The policy
prevents U.S. warships armed with nuclear weapons from making port
calls.
   Quayle said there is still a ``vacant chair'' for New Zealand in
the tripartite pact should it chose to return to full participation
and that he hoped that would be as soon as possible.
   The Australians have complained that U.S. subsidies on wheat
hurt their exports abroad, an argument that Quayle rejected. ``We
do not believe that it is injuring Australia,'' he said.
   In an editorial Friday, The Australian, a nationally circulated
newspaper, said, ``Who do you think you are kidding, Mr. Quayle?
Read our lips, Mr. Quayle. Australians are not happy.''
   All in all, however, Quayle has been well-received in a country
that enjoys smooth relations with the United States. Talking with
reporters aboard Air Force Two, Quayle called Australia a very
important country, with which the United States has close ties.
   He said his meetings with officials in Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand _ countries he visits next on his 12-day foreign trip _
might be more contentious because of frictions with the United
States, particularly on trade issues.

   Police arrested five suspected drug
traffickers and seized 609 pounds of semi-processed cocaine after a
light plane crash-landed near the Colombian border, Interpol
spokesman Efrain Ramirez said Friday.
   He said the aircraft, bound from Peru to Colombia, ran out of
fuel and came down in the jungle near Francisco de Orellana, 100
miles east of Quito.
   No one was hurt, he said, adding that two other men were held
after they flew in on a second small plane to aid the stricken
craft.
   The incident occurred April 17 but was not reported until Friday
to permit an investigation, Ramirez said. All those arrested are
Colombians, he said.
   In another incident, the newspaper El Comercio of Lima, Peru,
said a small plane carrying 440 pounds of semi-processed cocaine
crashed Tuesday in Peru's isolated Amazon jungle.
   Two suspected Colombian drug traffickers were killed, El
Comercio reported Friday.
   Officials say Peru is the source of about 60 percent of the
world's coca leaf, the raw material of cocaine. The plant is
semi-processed and flown from jungle airstrips to Colombia, where
it is processed into pure cocaine for sale in the United States and
Europe.
   Ramirez's organization, Interpol, is an international police
organization with headquarters in Paris.

   A grenade launcher, three machine guns and
other weapons were seized by police who arrested six people at a
motel Friday and authorities reported finding a Nazi flag in a car
searched during the raid.
   Federal weapons charges were lodged against five Texans and a
local man after authorities said they seized an M-16 grenade
launcher, three machine guns, five handguns, four rifles, a
shotgun, five automatic weapons and 10 silencers in the pre-dawn
raid on three rooms of a motel in the city's northeast section.
   City police and federal agents sought to determine what those
who were arrested had planned to do with the weapons. ``They're
very destructive sort of weapons,'' said John Kelso, assistant
special agent in charge of the FBI's Washington field office.
``They have the power to kill people or to inflict serious bodily
injury.''
   Six children, aged 7 to 15, were found in the motel rooms and
taken into protective custody, Kelso said.
   A Nazi flag was found in one of two cars, bearing Texas license
plates, searched during the raid, said Kelso.
   Authorities said the investigation started less than 24 hours
after the FBI's Dallas field office received a call from a suburban
Dallas woman, who was not further identified, saying that her son,
identified as John Barnhart, 33, had been kidnapped.
   The woman said Barnhart had been missing for two weeks and
instructed her to wire him $1,000 here or ``some harm would come to
him,'' according to Kelso.
   FBI agents traced Barnhart to the motel and quickly determined
that he hadn't been kidnapped, Kelso said.
   ``Apparently they may have been low on funds and this may have
been an effort by him to get some additional funds,'' Kelso said.
``It's unfortunate that he would involve his mother.''
   Police and the FBI, with assistance from the the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Secret Service, stormed the
three hotel rooms simultaneously at 3:30 a.m., EDT, said Sgt.
Joseph Gentile, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department.
   The Nazi flag, several knives and assorted documents also were
recovered, he said, refusing to divulge the contents of the
documents.
   Two people, identified as Richard William McEwen, 40, and his
wife, Billie Joy McEwen, 43, of Rowlett, Texas, suffered minor
injuries during the raid when officers restrained them from going
for their weapons, according to Gentile. Both were treated at D.C.
General Hospital and released to police custody.
   Others arrested were identified as Barnhart; Margaret Arredondo,
29, of Dallas; Kelvin Owen, 21, of Washington, D.C.; and Diane Joy
McEwen, 28, of Rowlett.

   Five congressmen put a trio of leading judges
on notice: the pay raise so vigorously sought by federal judges may
well depend on denying it to senior judges who do no judicial work.
   ``Pay raises should be reserved for those who work,'' said Rep.
Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., chairman of the House courts
subcommittee.
   His message was echoed by four Republican and Democratic
colleagues at a hearing Thursday. They were taken aback by
testimony from the judicial leaders, who are seeking a 30 percent
pay raise for all federal judges.
   U.S. Circuit Judge Frank Coffin depicted a federal bench
demoralized over the loss of a 51 percent pay raise earlier this
year, but he displayed no willingness to compromise in response to
complaints over pay that members of Congress hear when they go home
to the voters.
   ``I have never seen so many judges at all levels, in all courts,
and in all parts of the country so disheartened as I do today,''
Coffin said. ``Ours is a lunar landscape with all of the stark and
ominous silhouettes that the term implies.''

   An investigation into a $225 million federal
housing program shows it was used during the Reagan years ``to
feather the financial nest'' of former administration officials and
other prominent Republicans, the House Banking Committee chairman
says.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said he will hold hearings on
the report by the inspector general of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, which suggested favoritism and cronyism in
awarding federal housing renovation contracts.
   The report, released this week, documented how former Reagan
administration figures and other Republicans raked in handsome
profits on consulting contracts to rehabilitate subsidized
apartments for the poor.
   The consultants included President Reagan's first interior
secretary, James Watt; the late John Mitchell, attorney general
under President Nixon; former Republican Sen. Ed Brooke of
Massachusetts, and former Kentucky Gov. Louis Nunn, also a
Republican.

   Soviets are growing increasingly pessimistic about
their future, the mayor of Moscow told President Mikhail Gorbachev
during a meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee.
   Many Soviets believe the party has failed to lead society and
have lost faith in their leaders, Mayor Valery T. Saikin told
Gorbachev during an unprecedented closed-door exchange Tuesday.
Excerpts from the meeting were published Thursday in Pravda, the
party's official newspaper.
   Officials said one reason for the loss of faith has been that
Gorbachev's 4-year-old restructuring program of perestroika has
failed to solve many of the country's problems.
   Gorbachev, in closing remarks at the meeting Tuesday, agreed
perestroika was going poorly and was worsening shortages of
housing, consumer goods and food. But, the 58-year-old leader said,
people still have faith in the party.
   ``I do not agree with extreme judgments that the party is nearly
losing its position in the country or that it has turned into a
debating society and so on,'' Gorbachev said.

   Energy Secretary James Watkins says he is
delaying the restart of government reactors that produce a scarce
gas used to make nuclear weapons because safety problems have not
been fully assessed.
   The energy secretary disclosed on Thursday that he has pushed
back the timetable for restarting the department's three Savannah
River nuclear reactors in South Carolina, which are the nation's
only source of tritium gas used in warheads.
   Watkins also said, without revealing details, that the Energy
Department soon will unveil soon a ``new approach'' to building the
nation's first permanent repository for high-level nuclear waste in
Nevada. Local opposition to the facility is strong.
   Watkins said restart of the Savannah River reactors, which had
been planned for later this year, will not occur before early 1990.
He said in a letter to Congress and to Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney that the delay would not weaken the national defense.

<HEAD>`Wiseguy' Producers Hope Cool Doesn't Turn Cold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Miami Vice'' has gone cold. CBS'
``Wiseguy'' has become the hottest show in prime time.
   It's also the hippest guest shot on TV. The current storyline,
about the recording industry, guest stars rock stars Glenn Frey and
Deborah Harry, cult actor Tim Curry (``The Rocky Horror Picture
Show'') and former Don Johnson main squeeze Patti D'Arbanville.
   An earlier storyline lured reverse-cool Jerry Lewis into a rare
television role. Tony winner Ron Silver (``Speed-the-Plow'') played
Lewis' son.
   The attention is welcome _ for now _ but the pitfalls of being
annointed as hot by the coolest of the cool is not lost on the
show's producer-writers, Steve Kronish and David Burke.
   ``When you get too cool, you can get cold,'' said Kronish,
sitting in Burke's office in the Stephen J. Cannell Productions
building in Hollywood, a long way from Vancouver, where ``Wiseguy''
is filmed.
   Kronish said he and Burke plan to avoid big-name stars in the
future and return to the obscure, offbeat casting that impressed
the industry and TV critics alike when the show premiered last
season.
   The first storyline rejuvenated Ray Sharkey's career. Then,
unknowns Kevin Spacey and Joan Severance made a splash as an
incestuous brother-sister crime wave in a second storyline. Another
of last season's guest stars was '60s Andy Warhol film veteran Joe
Dallesandro.
   ``Wiseguy'' is something of a distant cousin of ``Miami Vice.''
Burke co-wrote the pilot of ``Crime Story'' for ``Miami Vice''
executive producer Michael Mann.
   Burke's road to Hollywood was winding. His father, former
late-night New York talk-show host Alan Burke, disapproved of his
son's show-biz aspirations, but begrudgingly got him a job with a
friend, director Otto Preminger.
   Burke moved into documentary production and became a political
media consultant for clients ranging from Jamaica to U.S. Senate
candidate Jay Rockefeller.
   ``The script that got me essentially plugged into this business
I was working on during a tour of West Virginia with Jay
Rockefeller, from television station to television station,'' Burke
said. ``At the end of the day I'd go back to the hotel and sit in
the hotel office and work on the script. It's actually a pilot now
at ABC.''
   ``Sacraments'' is about the mayor of a large, Northeastern city
who came up from the streets, bringing his working-class cohorts
into power with him.
   Kronish, armed with a degree in journalism, got a job as talent
coordinator on a local talk show in L.A. A play he had written
landed him his first script-writing job after he was variously
unemployed, an insurance salesman and an assistant golf pro. His
first steady TV job was a game show called, appropriately enough,
``Anything for Money.''
   While still overseeing ``Wiseguy,'' Burke and Kronish found
themselves with another series at midseason, NBC's ``Unsub,'' about
a crack federal forensic unit.
   Paul Monas, an attorney friend of Burke, had come up with the
idea a couple of years ago. Burke mentioned it to Cannell, but
other projects ensued and Burke forgot about it. At a lunch last
fall with NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff, Cannell
offhandedly pitched ``Unsub.'' The show was on the air three months
later.
   ``Unsub'' was a modestly successful midseason replacement.
``Wiseguy,'' meanwhile, has begun to catch on. CBS, picking up on
the cult status of the show, has launched an aggressive ad campaign.
   Burke and Kronish are hoping, though, that the show is not a
mega-hit.
   ``Maybe the fact that it isn't does give us a certain amount of
freedom to do things that a hit show might not be able to do,''
said Kronish.
   ``I think the people who like `Wiseguy' like it because we've
done things that are relatively unexpected, and I think we deal
with the sort of gray areas of these characters' lives that a lot
of episodic TV doesn't deal with.''
   ``I think that we haven't been a hit in terms of big numbers was
a benefit in terms of being left alone to do what we want,'' said
Burke.
   ``I found this year, particularly following the (Jerry Lewis-Ron
Silver storyline), we suddenly were being watched a lot more
closely by everybody, the network, people out there who watch the
show in general, and the question of, can we do that? became one
that started getting asked, and it was never asked before.''

<TEXT>
   The widely publicized death of a
prostitute has increased concern about AIDS, and officials are
trying to dispel false ideas about the disease in a nation where
sex is a flourishing trade.
   Officials say at least 22 people in the Philippines have
developed active AIDS cases and 100 have been identified as
carriers of the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   Sixty-one of the 100 carriers are female prostitutes and 50 of
them work near Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval base, the two
huge U.S. military installations in the Philippines.
   Dr. Erlinda Guerrero, the national AIDS registrar, believes the
true figures are higher. She says inadequate testing and reporting
methods may be missing 90 percent of the carriers.
   Since 30 per cent of carriers develop symptoms of the disease in
five years, She fears AIDS cases could reach 300 by then.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome, for which there is no cure,
weakens the body's ability to resist infection and makes the victim
vulnerable to a range of fatal illnesses. It is spread by sexual
contact, use of infected needles and contaminated blood products.
   Officials say all but three of the 22 AIDS patients acquired the
disease abroad.
   Two of the three who contracted it in the Philippines have died.
   A male homosexual died last year and the second victim was a
24-year-old bar girl from Angeles, home of Clark Air Base. Her
death last month was widely publicized.
   She died at the time of newspaper reports that a young Brazilian
woman, who claimed to have had sex with many prominent Filipinos,
tested positive for the AIDS virus. The Brazilian has left the
country and, because of privacy regulations, health officials
refuse to confirm whether she was infected.
   Officials say AIDS could spread rapidly in the Philippines
because of prostitution and public misconceptions of the disease.
   Peter Resurrecion of the national AIDS control program, said a
Gallup survey of 35 nations had the Philippines among the countries
whose people believe the disease can be contracted by working
beside infected people or sharing drinking glasses with them, or
from insect bites.
   A survey by the Health Department found that many male
prostitutes thought exercise prevents AIDS, he said.
   Officials say 94 percent of men who contracted AIDS or carried
the virus had not used condoms.
   Health Department workers are studying ways to combat AIDS myths
and are instructing the public on effective precautions. Officials
plan to spend most of the $467,290 allocated for AIDS control on
print and broadcast advertising.
   ``Our basic goal is to change the behavior of people,
considering that each individual has the responsibility to protect
himself,'' Dr. Guerrero said.
   In Angeles, city health officer Proceso Mejia said posters
saying ``Prevent AIDS, Use Condoms'' and ``No Condom, No Sex'' were
placed in the bar district.
   The high percentage of AIDS carriers among prostitutes working
near U.S. bases has led some women's groups to urge that the
installations be closed to keep the disease from spreading.
   ``We think AIDS is coming to the Philippines through the U.S.
bases,'' said Adul de Leon, an official of the militant feminist
organization Gabriela, which demands that the United States finance
AIDS control programs.
   Dr. Guerrero said the high incidence around the bases may be
traceable to the fact that, since U.S. authorities paid for the
program, 67 per cent of the 108,000 screened were from those areas.
   U.S. officials have promised that any American service member
found to carry the virus will not be assigned to the Philippines.

   A decade ago, China set a course of
market-oriented reform the Soviet Union has just begun. It has
experienced the reward and pain of economic freedom for a communist
society, and may have some valuable lessons for Mikhail S.
Gorbachev during the first Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years.

<TEXT>
   For Mikhail Gorbachev, China's chaotic blend of
plenty and want, success and failure is a vision of what may await
the Soviet Union as it embarks on economic and social reform.
   He arrives May 15 on a mission to normalize relations between
the two Communist giants after 30 years of hostility. One thing he
will take home is a lesson in the difficulties of easing a
communist state's grip on the economy.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping began market-oriented reforms 10
years ago, long before Gorbachev and perestroika came along.
   Gross national product has tripled. Foreign trade has gone from
$40 billion in 1980 to $100 billion last year.
   Per capita income still is equivalent to only about $200 a year,
but has more than tripled in the decade. Families that once
scrimped to buy a bicycle now own refrigerators, color televisions
and stereos.
   The early euphoria is over, however, and the corrosive effects
of inflation and corruption threaten the future of liberalization.
Annual inflation is more than 30 percent in a nation that for
decades banned price increases, and profiteering is rampant.
   Democratic reform is another story. Gorbachev has held
multiple-candidate elections and opened up the press with his
glasnost policy, but Deng believes intellectual freedom should be
doled out as economic reforms progress.
   Huge student demonstrations in past weeks illustrated the
profound dissatisfaction of educated Chinese with their government.
   Deng permitted the Democracy Wall movement of 1978-79, in which
posters for democracy were displayed, while it served his political
purposes. Then he crushed it and threw the leaders in jail.
   The official press is encouraged to be a watchdog, but is not
permitted to criticize Communist Party leaders or the system.
   Gorbachev will be shown the dazzling successes of ``gaige'' and
``kaifang,'' China's words for reform and opening to the outside
world.
   Reform has produced 23 million entrepreneurs, many operating
from bicycles or roadside stands, who did $35 billion) worth of
business last year.
   Vendors and family farmers freed from now-defunct communes have
combined to keep free markets stocked with fruit, vegetables and
meat _ afind 16,000 joint ventures in China with a total commitment
of $25 billion.
   Many are small textile or appliance factories that have created
instant boomtowns in southern China near Hong Kong, the capitalist
enclave.
   China also has glistening Sheraton and Hilton hotels,
restaurants ranging from Kentucky Fried Chicken to Maxim's, and
Shanghai factories producing Volkswagen autos and McDonnell Douglas
passenger planes.
   Four special economic zones have nearly a free hand in seeking
foreign investment and are in cutthroat competition, offering
preferential treatment to foreign companies.
   Many of the bold experiments have been slowed by concern for
inflation, but not before they transformed concepts of socialist
ownership and financing.
   About 6,000 enterprises have issued shares, mostly to employees.
Many economists see shareholding as the best way for money-losing
state factories to spur worker initiative and raise capital.
   Primitive stock markets have sprung up in several large cities
and a nationwide stock exchange is being debated.
   Exchange markets for treasury bonds operate in 61 cities. Real
estate markets are emerging as the government encourages private
housing and sale of land to developers.
   Chinese peasants, for millenia harnessed to their plows, have a
new mobility.
   Eighty million, one-tenth of the rural population, have found
jobs in the small industries that have provided much of the
economic growth. Millions more have been drawn to cities by the
booming construction and service industries.
   Old habits of state interference and the ``iron rice bowl'' of
guaranteed employment refuse to die, but factory owners have the
right to hire and fire workers.
   A bankruptcy law permits state factories to be closed for losing
money, although they seldom are. Many workers have contracts with
their employers and, at least in theory, can quit if something
better turns up when the contract is fulfilled.
   The benefits of economic reform has been great, but the bills
are coming due and Chinese leaders flinch at their size.
   According to official figures, the living standards of one-third
of urban residents declined last year because of rising prices.
   A nationwide mania for building and the state's loss of control
over credit have overheated the economy. Excessive growth has
caused an energy crunch and shortages of raw materials, which
encourage profiteering.
   Small farmers, once heroes, are being blamed for four successive
poor grain harvests because they would rather grow cash crops for
the free markets than cheap grain for the state.
   Last month, the government responded to the bad news with an
austerity program that cut off investment credit, canceled
thousands of building projects and returned central control to wide
areas of prices, finance and foreign trade.
   It also has put a moratorium on further reforms, the end to
price controls deemed essential to achieving balance between supply
and demand.
   Unemployment, theoretically nonexistent in a socialist state,
has become reality. The government gives the rate as 2 percent, but
does not count millions of people laid off by the closures of rural
enterprises whose credito or supplies dried up.
   Railway stations were clogged last winter with peasants trying
to reach cities for construction jobs, most of which already had
been eliminated.
   Leaders have acknowledged their errors and say the reforms will
continue when the current mess is cleared up.
   Deng, the 84-year-old father of the reforms, told the president
of Togo recently: ``If there had been enough vigilance ... three or
four years ago, things would be much better today.''
   Deeply disturbing to the Chinese are social problems that did
not exist when everyone read from the same Little Red Book and
lived in the same egalitarian poverty.
   Widening income gaps contributed to a 13 percent increase in
crime last year. The number of larceny cases rose 64 percent.
   Elders are horrified by the materialism of the young and their
more casual attitudes toward sex and pornography. Cases of venereal
disease tripled in 1988, to 56,000.
   Educated Chinese, long victimized by Mao Tse-tung's
anti-intellectual policies, are angered by a situation in which
doctors and professors are paid the equivalent of $50 a month while
illiterate street peddlers earn $1,000. Thousands want to go abroad
for study or work, and many will not return.
   Premier Li Peng, the cautious technocrat who engineered the
current economic slowdown, has led the appeal for a return to the
old values of sacrifice and thrift.
   ``People should be ideologically prepared to live a hard life
for a few years,'' he said.
   Few are. Even the Communist Party is plagued by corruption as
people use official powers to commandeer and resell scarce
industrial and consumer goods.
   One report from Sichuan said 150 tons of government fertilizer
for grain farmers was sold 26 times before it actually got to them.

   China and the Soviet Union were brothers in
communism, but the first summit since they fell out nearly 30 years
ago will not be a family reunion.
   The Chinese, determined to show independence from their one-time
tutor in revolution, have forced the Soviets to make the overtures
and concessions toward normal relations.
   When Mikhail S. Gorbachev comes to Beijing on May 15, it will be
Deng Xiaoping, the 84-year-old Chinese leader, who plays big
brother, because of both age and his pioneering of economic reforms
the Soviets are just beginning.
   During the past year, Gorbachev pulled Soviet troops out of
Afghanistan, announced unilateral troop withdrawals from the
Chinese border and put pressure on the Soviet ally Vietnam to
withdraw from Cambodia after more than a decade of occupation.
Vietnam has said it will do so by Sept. 30.
   Those actions met China's three conditions for a summit with the
Soviet leader and moved closer to Gorbachev's own goal of reducing
international tension so he can focus on domestic economic problems.
   China agreed to the summit almost grudgingly.
   When Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister,
announced the date during a visit to Beijing in February, the
Chinese initially denied it and then issued a confirmation two days
later.
   Ties between the two nations in trade, foreign policy and
cultural exchange have become close in the past decade, but Chinese
leaders say they have no intention of resuming the alliance.
   The main immediate value of the summit for China, which is wary
of an expansionist Vietnam, has been the concessions on Cambodia.
   Diplomatic sources said the Chinese were trying to extract new
pledges even in the final weeks before Gorbachev's arrival.
   Vietnam's withdrawal plan does not include a U.N. peacekeeping
force or establishment of an interim government to oversee
elections. China is said to want both endorsed in the summit
communique.
   Moscow seeks a general statement of principles guiding the
relationship, like the Shanghai Communique signed by President
Richard M. Nixon on his 1972 visit to China.
   ``It's not obligatory'' to mention Cambodia in the communique,
said V.V. Duhin, cultural counsellor at the Soviet Embassy. ``This
document is designed for many years, and Cambodia is a problem of
this year and next year.''
   Igor Rogachev, Soviet deputy foreign minister, slipped into
Beijing quietly in late April, hoping to resolve the matter. A
Western diplomat described it as a ``game of chicken.''
   Animosity and disagreement between the two countries have a long
history. From the 17th century to the early 20th, China and Russia
contended for influence in the vast Asian interior.
   Soviet agents helped organize the Chinese Communist Party in
1921 and gave it assistance, but also tried to dictate strategy in
a way that irked the revolutionaries, especially Mao Tse-tung.
   Josef Stalin thought little of Mao's plan for revolution in the
countryside. The Soviet dictator continued recognizing the
Nationalist Chinese government even as Mao's peasant guerrilla army
was sweeping to victory.
   Friction continued after the Stalin-Mao alliance of 1950. The
Soviets insisted on special rights to ports and railways in
northeastern China in return for military and technological aid,
embarrassing Chinese leaders who claimed to have ended foreign
control.
   The split came in the early 1960s, after the Soviets refused to
back China in its 1959 border conflict with India, would not help
recapture Taiwan from the Nationalists and scrubbed an agreement to
help the Chinese build a nuclear bomb.
   A border dispute led to a brief but bloody clash in 1969.
   Pragmatism took precedence over ideology under Deng, and China
resumed trade and other non-political exchanges with the Soviet
Union.
   Both Gorbachev and Deng like to be seen as international
peacemakers, and both have serious economic and political problems
at home.
   Restless nationalist groups in the Soviet Union have been
demanding autonomy or independence. University students in Beijing
have demonstrated for democracy on an unprecedented scale.
   Deng already has done away with Mao's communes and shelved his
theories of continuous class struggle.
   By meeting Gorbachev, Deng is addressing one of Mao's last
remaining legacies: the Chinese-Soviet estrangement that has
affected the world political map for three decades.

   Here is a chronology of major events in
Chinese-Soviet relations since the People's Republic of China was
established in 1949:
   _October 1949: The Soviet Union was the first foreign nation to
recognize the People's Republic led by Mao Tse-tung.
   _December 1949: Mao mades his first trip to Moscow and was
snubbed by Josef Stalin, who met the Chinese revolutionary only
after Mao threatened to return home.
   _February 1950: After difficult negotiations, Mao and Stalin
signed a friendship treaty.
   _1955: The Soviets left Dalian, or Port Arthur, which they had
occupied since Wo _February 1956: Nikita Khrushchev's speech criticizing
Stalin,
who died in 1953, surprised and angered the Chinese Communists.
They accused the Soviets of rerld War II.
  visionism.
   _October 1957: The Soviets agreed to furnish China with a sample
atomic bomb. The promise was retracted two years later after
relations began to cool.
   _1958: Khrushchev visited Beijing to urge caution toward the
United States in China's conflict with Taiwan over the offshore
islands of Quemoy and Matsu, but was rebuffed.
   _October 1959: Khrushschev visited Beijing for the 10th
anniversary of the People's Republic. Talks with Mao went badly and
ref the
campaign, which began last year.
   Unlike the dozens of other national academies in Rome, the
American Academy receives no direct government financing. It does
apply for and receive some federal grants.
   ``The endowment was great when McKim, J.P. Morgan, William K.
Vanderbilt and others put it together in the early 1900s and it
wasn't bad in the 1940s and 50s,'' said Joseph Connors, the new
academy director.
   ``But as of the 70s and 80s it began to look very insignificant
to the needs of the academy. After the drop in the dollar in 1985,
it's been very hard for us to pay our bills.''.
   Keeping all the academy's fellows happy also has been difficult.
They find the modest stipends for a year of study and work do not
go far in one of Europe's most expensive cities.
   Stipends range from less than $6,000 to $11,000 plus a room,
studio and daily meal at the academy.
   This year's literature fellow, Edward Hirsch, said he would have
stayed home had not the University of Houston, where he teaches,
supplemented his stipend of about $8,000. A predecessor, novelist
Padgett Powell, left the academy early because he could not afford
to stay.
   ``It's difficult to live on the stipend if you're alone, very
difficult if you have a spouse and impossible if you have a
family,'' said Hirsch, 39, who brought his wife and child.
   Criticism from the outside also crops up now and then. There
have been complaints, which Connors rejects, that the academy is
isolated, overlooks Rome in both senses of the word and is a clubby
institute little known beyond the Janiculum.
   Connors, a 44-year-old art and architecture historian from
Columbia University, says he is trying to improve the financial and
living conditions for fellows.
   He said the lowest stipend will be raised next year from $5,800
to $7,500 and he hopes to arrange apartment suites for families.
   Many fellows would like better food in the academy dining hall,
which they say suits a college cafeteria more than a city renowned
for cuisine, but most agree with Hirsch that the academy's benefits
far outweigh the hardships.
   ``Aside from more money for the fellowships and higher quality
of food, it's hard to know what the academy can do better,'' he
said.
   ``Being in Rome has affected me as a writer. Americans have a
poor sense of history and you can't walk around Rome without being
immersed in history.
   ``It's inspiring, drinking at a cafe where Goethe drank and
standing in the cemetery where Keats is buried. ... There's no
doubt I'll be writing about Rome in one way or the other for many
years to come.''
   John Obuck, a 41-year-old painter from New York, said he
sometimes misses the razzle-dazzle Manhattan art scene but loves
the soft Roman light.
   ``It's so different from New York City,'' he said. ``I have a
studio with a huge skylight so I can paint in the daylight. I don't
know how I'll ever go back to artificial light.''
   Each year, the academy selects about 25 fellows from 1,000
applicants. They are chosen by a jury of prominent artists and
scholars in New York on the basis of submitted works, proposed
projects and interviews.
   A few resident and visiting scholars also stay at the academy
for a few months to work on their own projects and counsel younger
fellows. This year, they have included Brodsky, Mary McCarthy and
Harrison Salisbury.
   Most fellows live and work in the main building, a palazzo of
marble and faded red stucco built at the turn of the century.
   Academy directors and visitors normally live up the road at the
Villa Aurelia, a 17th century palace in landscaped gardens and ilex
trees that was Garibaldi's headquarters during the battle with the
French in 1849.
   The academy library, considered one of the world's finest for
classical studies and archaeology, is open to the public and
attracts many researchers.
   Fellows generally are left on their own to pursue their
projects. There are no courses, exams or graduation ceremonies.
   In the spring, the artists have a public exhibit, the scholars
give lectures and the composers present a concert.

   Exxon Corp. Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl keeps a
book about shipwrecks on a shelf of his sprawling, sparsely
furnished office. But to the head of the nation's biggest oil
company, the worst shipwreck of all happened on his watch and now
he's paying the price of public rebuke.
   The one-time petroleum engineer, who took over Exxon's helm in
January 1987, has agonized over the image-beating the company has
taken since an Exxon supertanker hit a reef in Valdez, Alaska, and
spewed 250,000 barrels of gooey crude into pristine Prince William
Sound, the worst spill in U.S. history.
   Rightly or wrongly, the 60-year-old executive has been accused
by critics of mismanaging the disaster from the start, particularly
because he seemed to remain hidden from the press and public for a
week afterward.
   While the nation awaited word from Exxon about the spill on that
Good Friday morning in March, the company chairman admits he was
holed up at his house in a New York suburb.
   ``I figured the best thing to do was stay by the phone. So I
spent the day on the phone at home, basically,'' Rawl said in an
interview in his spacious 51st-floor corner office in the Exxon
tower in midtown Manhattan.
   In fact, Rawl said, he had to convince himself not to rush to
Alaska to take charge after aides telephoned him with the news a
few hours after the Exxon Valdez grounded on Bligh Reef.
   ``My first instinct is to become an operator. My first instinct
on anything is to go,'' said Rawl. But he indicated, in retrospect,
that may have been a mistake.
   ``I had some advice that didn't make a whole lot of sense,'' he
said, adding, ``But I could have done anything. If I wanted to go
to Alaska I mean I'll go.''
   After consulting with company executives, Rawl said, he decided
his presence in Valdez would detract from the critical first task
of keeping the supertanker from leaking more oil.
   Rawl inherited the chief executive suite at the 107-year-old
company more than two years ago and is not well known to the
outside world. A career Exxon executive whose personal earnings
topped $9 million last year, Rawl says he is comfortable in the
vast office.
   A 10-foot live ficus tree is the most prominent feature. A
blue-jacketed book titled ``Ships and Shipwrecks'' leans on a shelf
with a handful of others.
   ``I'm not much for decoration; I've been told that,'' he said,
eyeing the bare walls. ``Everyone wants to decorate it for me.''
   For the first time in his 37 years with Exxon, Rawl has had to
publicly defend himself and his company against what he calls
``deep and virulent attacks,'' something with which he is clearly
uncomfortable.
   Attempting to convince an unbelieving public of the company's
sincerity, he says, has become the most painful crisis of his
executive career.
   Rawl was born and raised in New Jersey, the fifth of six
children. His father was a truck driver who worked in New York and
his mother a housewife, who held outside jobs during the Depression.
   After high school and a two-year stint in the Marines, Rawl went
West to explore new territory. His journey ended at Oklahoma
University where he got a degree in petroleum engineering in 1952.
That same year he joined Exxon in Houston. Since then he has served
in a range of roles, including vice president and president before
he became chairman and chief executive.
   But Rawl, whose hobbies include golf and fly fishing, said he
never had big plans for himself.
   ``I wanted to get a job and make a pretty decent living and I
never really aspired to doing much more than that,'' he said.
   Rawl said he believes fate has guided his career and will
continue to do so.
   `Sometimes you're not sure whether it's good or bad luck ... but
there's been a lot of luck,'' the executive said.
   Despite his new role in the limelight Rawl remains an enigma to
many Wall Street security analysts who follow the company.
   ``This is the only company that analysts don't get a chance to
sit with the operating management,'' said Frank P. Knuettel, with
the investment firm Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   As to where and how the company is moving, Knuettel said,
``frankly being so quiet it's rather difficult to make a
judgment.'' He says many of his analyses are ``hit and miss.''
   Stephen Smith, of Bear Stearns &amp; Co., said Rawl is ``quieter
than the average.''
   ``He's been a little less public about the company's plans.
There have been less analyst meetings since he's been there,''
Smith said.
   Rawl readily admits he's not the most effusive personality but
dismisses accusations he has evaded the press or Wall Street
scrutiny.
   ``I know I'm not, certainly not, flamboyant. I don't believe I
could carry that off. But I'm not hidden out,'' the chairman said.

   George Washington liked cornbread. And his
second cousin five times removed says his illustrious ancestor must
have passed the taste on to him.
   James Buchanan IV, an R&amp;B musician from Texas, says he inherited
from his great-great-great uncle, the 15th president of the United
States, not only his name but ``a lot of nice furniture,''
including a teak desk that was a gift from the King of Siam.
   ``The notion of public service'' was Thomas Jefferson's legacy
to his family, which today includes many teachers, says John Works,
his great-great-great-great-great grandson and a Wall Street lawyer.
   The curator, the musician and the lawyer are among descendants
of 39 former presidents _ all but Ronald Reagan _ who will gather
at Federal Hall in lower Manhattan on Sunday for the bicentennial
commemoration of Washington's presidential inauguration.
   The New York City Commission on the Bicentennial of the
Constitution said it would be the largest gathering ever of men and
women with presidential bloodlines.
   Peter Nissen, a freelance researcher, was the commission's
official descendant hunter. It took ``a lot of detective work,'' he
says. Buchanan's family, for example, was particularly hard to
locate.
   Phone calls to Buchanans listed in Mercersberg, Pa., where the
president was born, first turned up the Buchanan Inn _ ``they asked
if I wanted dinner'' _ and then Buchanan Tomatoes _ ``they grow
hydroponic tomatoes,'' said Nissen.
   Eventually, he got in touch with James Buchanan IV in Austin,
Texas, who is coming with his mother, Eleanor Henry, 69.
   ``It sounds like a whole lot of fun!'' said Buchanan, 40. ``I've
got my tux ready for the presidential ball and all the parades, and
I chipped in with my sister to buy a new camera for my mother.''
   The presidential descendants include stockbrokers, a high school
student, company executives, lawyers, writers, a teacher and a
former U.S. representative to the United Nations.
   Some of them describe their ancestors' terms in office with
glowing admiration, while others offer a more dispassionate
appraisal. But all speak of their presidential forebears with pride.
   Robert Fillmore Norfleet, 18, a senior at St. Christopher High
School in Richmond, Va., and the great-great-great-great nephew of
Millard Fillmore, recently studied the 13th president in his U.S.
history class.
   ``When you hear of Millard Fillmore you think of him as being an
ineffective and mediocre person,'' said Norfleet, a football and
lacrosse player, student council member and sports editor for the
school newspaper.
   But he noted that Fillmore ``came from a very prestigious
background, was a smart man, well-mannered and liked by a lot of
people.''
   David B. Roosevelt, 47, a New York stockbroker, spoke of the
``strength and foresight'' of his grandfather, Franklin D.
Roosevelt, which, he said, enabled him ``to develop policies which,
although they may have seemed perhaps radical and at times severe
and very unpopular, were vital for this country.''
   He then tempered his words of praise with modesty. ``We were
taught to be proud of the heritage and accomplishments of our
grandparents but to never use these for personal advancement or
gain,'' he said.
   Andrew Jackson IV, an assistant attorney general in Knoxville,
Tenn., was impressed with his great-great-great grandfather's
``honesty and patriotism.''
   ``I don't think he was the best president but I think he was up
there with the better part of them,'' he added.
   His name sometimes prompts jokes, Jackson said: ```I thought you
were dead' or `You're looking fine to be 200 years old.'''
   Can Harrison Ruffin Tyler, the president of a chemical treatment
company in Ashland, Va., really be the grandson of John Tyler, the
10th president?
   Tyler explains: ``My grandfather was 63 when Father was born in
1853. Then my father was 75 when I was born in 1928. So, it does
add up.''
   John Tyler, who had 15 children by two wives, set ``a
presidential record that will never be broken,'' noted the
descendant. ``He certainly was a family man.''
   One of the most common sentiments expressed by the presidential
descendants is regret that they don't know more about their famous
ancestors.
   Benjamin Harrison Walker, 68, a vice president of an insurance
company in New York, said as a young man he was embarrassed to ask
his grandmother about his grandfather, Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd
president who died in 1901.
   ``Sadly, I didn't talk to them,'' he said.
   One of the most distant of the presidential descendants to
attend the bicentennial festivities is Clement E. Conger, of
Alexandria, Va., who is the second cousin five times removed of the
man whose inauguration is being honored.
   Sarah Ball, Conger's great-great-great-great grandmother, was
the first cousin of Mary Ball, who was Washington's mother,
explained Conger, curator of the diplomatic reception rooms at the
State Department and former curator of the White House.
   ``I consented rather reluctantly to go'' to the inaugural
commemoration, he said. ``I felt someone with the name Washington
might have been a better representative.''
   But Conger, who is in his 70s, is well chosen; he is an expert
on Washington's life, from important facts about his presidency to
trivial insights into his private life.
   ``My mother was eminently interested in history,'' Conger said.
``My brother didn't like cornbread so, of course, I didn't. But my
mother would say `George Washington ate cornbread' and that meant
the little Conger boys should eat it.
   ``I love cornbread now,'' he added.

   Spring has kissed central Alabama, and
L.C. Crosby once again is busy planting corn, peas, butter beans
and okra. He's also hoping for a bumper watermelon crop this summer.
   ``I've got a plan,'' he says as he leans against his old Ford
tractor. ``If it works out, I'm going to get my watermelons on the
market two or three weeks earlier than anybody else and I'll clean
up.''
   Crosby, a friendly man with a wiry build, becomes excited as he
talks about his crops and the 43-acre ``dream farm'' where he and
his family once worked as field hands. However, this could be the
last spring for his dream, and for a lot of other dreams like his.
   At 33, L.C. Crosby is a young, black farmer. And, as such he's
twice as likely to lose his land as his white counterpart.
   In 1910, the nation's 950,000 black farmers comprised 14 percent
of all farmers in this country. Now, the remaining 35,000 make up
just 1.6 percent of the 2.3 million farmers in the United States.
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of black farms
declined by 42 percent between 1978 and 1982. White farms fell by
only 2.4 percent during the same period.
   ``Unless this trend is reversed, there will be no more black
farmers in America by the year 2,000.'' This dire prediction is
contained in the U.S. Civil Rights Commission's 1982 report on the
``Decline of Black Farmers in America.''
   Yet, while there's just a relative handful of young, black
farmers still operating _ the current, median age for U.S. black
farmers is 60 _ the federal government is trying to force L.C.
Crosby off his land.
   ``The FHA (Farmer's Home Administration) has given him notice to
vacate the premises because he's behind on his loan. But we're
telling him to stay put and fight,'' says George Paris, Jr., a
field coordinator for the private, non-profit Federation of
Southern Cooperatives.
   Crosby bought his farm, which includes a large pond and
five-acre pecan orchard, at an FHA auction in 1985. He bid $36,500,
borrowing $31,000 from the government.
   ``My annual payment is $3,800,'' he said. ``I fell behind the
second year. Now, I've got the money to make the payment but the
FHA wants the whole $30,000.''
   Paris said he's heard that a wealthy white landowner, whose bid
was $10,000 lower than Crosby's, covets the property.
   ``It's the same old story,'' he said. ``The FHA is slowly
changing but basically, at the local level, quite often its still a
bunch of good ol' white boys who look after each other.''
   Paris' father, who worked for the FHA for nearly 30 years and
was one of the first black men ever to serve as an assistant county
supervisor, agrees with this assessment.
   ``It was tragic. Blacks always got the last and the least,''
said the elder Paris, adding that he saw hundreds of black
Alabamians lose their farms during the 30 years he workd for the
FHA.
   ``I remember one time back, in the '60s, I was told, outright,
by a white FHA committee member in Bullock County, Ala., that a
black farmer had been denied a loan because he was `shooting off
his mouth about civil rights.'''
   Under the FHA's loan procedure, a county supervisor makes a
recommendation to a three-member county loan committee, which then
either approves or denies the loan. Fred Bennett, a 73-year-old
farmer in the Mt. Zion community, near Greenville, was the first
black ever to serve on an FHA county committee.
   In this country, the average black-owned farm contains fewer
than 100 acres, compared with an average of 440 acres for all U.S.
farms. Bennett and his wife Lena own 500 acres, which they slowly
acquired over the past 40 years, parcel by parcel.
   ``My grandfather came to this area at age 12, shortly after he
was freed from slavery,'' Bennett said. ``He never owned land,
being a cash renter, but I've found that, for a black man in this
country, there is no greater security, nor better avenue to
independence, than farming.''
   Bennett, who said he and his four brothers pooled their
resources and ``pulled together toward a common objective,''
acknowledged he is worried and saddened that this generation of
young blacks isn't going into agriculture.
   ``After the Civil War, the federal government promised the freed
blacks 40 acres and a mule but hardly any of them got it,'' he
said. ``Our people should realize by now that they've got to help
themselves; nobody's going to do it for them.
   ``I'm very concerned that young blacks are turning their backs
on farming, at a time when life in the cities is getting worse
every day.''
   The United Farmers Organization, a non-profit advocacy group
based in Charlotte, N.C., estimates there now are fewer than 200
full-time black farmers, aged 25 or under, in the entire country.
   Officials at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, who say they
are getting 25 percent fewer agriculture students than they did 20
years ago, blame farming's poor image and the enormous difficulty
young blacks face in amassing capital.
   The continuing phenomenon of black land loss was the topic at a
recent meeting sponsored by the university and the United Church of
Christ.
   ``Greed and institutional racism'' are the major reasons blacks
have been forced out of farming said the Rev. Charles Shelby Rooks,
director of the church's Board of Homeland Ministries, in his
keynote address at the conference in Greensboro, N.C.
   In its report, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission found that
blacks were being ill-served by the FHA, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's agency designed specifically to help poor farmers.
   The commission, noting that black farmers _ 90 percent of whom
are in the South _ often are unable to deal with the ever more
complex federal loan programs. The commission called for serious
government intervention.
   Last July, as part of an omnibus farm bill passed by Congress in
1987, the FHA launched its ``Socially Disadvantaged Outreach Farm
Ownership Program.''
   ``So far,'' said FHA spokesman Nolan Kegley, ``we have made 58
loans to minority farmers under the program.'' He said the loans,
totalling $4.6 million, are to finance farm purchases for poor
blacks and other minorities.
   ``We recognize the problems of the past and we're working on
them at all levels,'' Kegley said. ``Since 1984 the percentage of
FHA loans to blacks has been steadily increasing.''
   He acknowledged, when asked, however, that only 91 of the FHA's
1,849 county supervisors are black. In Mississippi, the state with
the most black farmers, eight of the 82 county supervisors are
black. In North Carolina, it's only three of 79.
   FHA officials in those states say they have had little luck
recruiting qualified blacks because the goverment pay scale isn't
competitive.

   In Alabama, however, eight of 57 county supervisors are black,
two of seven district supervisors are black and 49 of 203 county
committee members are black.
   George Paris says the FHA must make such across-the-board
efforts in every state if black farmers are to have an equal chance
to survive.
   The new FHA minority funding outreach program does little, he
said, to help many of those black farmers already indebted to the
federal government.
   ``If they really want to help black farmers they should forgive
their past debts and let them start over,'' he added. ``Lord knows
the FHA has done little enough in the past to help small farmers.''
   Paris' organization is in the forefront of the effort to help
black farmers stay on the land. The federation offers counseling in
crop planning and farm management. It also helps poor farmers,
black and white, wade through the intracacies of the FHA loan and
appeal procedures.
   Jerry Pennick, who heads the federation's Land Assistance Fund,
has helped draft a proposed ``Minority Farmer's Act'' that would
provide emergency aid. Among other things, it would create a
special agency within the USDA to deal with concerns of minority
farmers and develop a special debt restructuring program for
farmers who are less than $100,000 in hock to the FHA.
   ``We hope to get the bill introduced this fall or early next
year,'' Pinnock said. ``The black congressional caucus is planning
to push it. We also have assurances of support support from some
white congressmen.''
   Black farmers such as L.C. Crosby, meanwhile, are hanging on by
a slender thread.
   For others, such as Tim Pigford, a ruined third-generation
farmer from Arcadia, N.C., the thread has snapped.
   ``I haven't farmed since 1984, the year the hurricane blew
through here,'' said Pigford, who now works in a factory. ``The FHA
never would loan me enough money to buy a farm, just enough to rent
out land to farm. But the hurricane ruined me and now the
government is trying to take my house.''
   Pigford, who testified in 1984 before a congressional committee
investigating the FHA's lending practices, added that he thinks his
chances are slim of ever getting back onto a tractor seat.
   Another young farmer, George Ammans, who raises turkeys at
Kenansville, N.C., says whites shouldn't think that black farmers
are just looking for free handouts.
   ``Like bald eagles I'm a member of an endangered species,'' he
said. ``If the government is willing to help eagles, it oughta be
willing to help me. All I want is a chance to survive.''

   The government said consumer spending rose a
slim 0.2 percent in March, its weakest performance in six months
and a sign, analysts said, that consumers are contributing to an
economic slowdown.
   The sluggish spending came even as personal income rose a strong
0.8 percent. That combination boosted the personal savings rate to
its highest level in nearly four years, the Commerce Department
said Thursday.
   The government also reported that the prices Americans paid for
imported goods rose 1.7 percent in the first quarter, largely
reflecting a surge in the cost of crude oil from abroad.

<HEAD>Regulators: Drexel State Settlements Will Be Delayed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roadblocks in the settlement of criminal fraud
charges against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. will delay states from
levying fines and stripping the investment firm's brokerage
licenses, state securities officials say.
   Nevertheless, lawyers for Drexel have met with regulators in all
50 states to try to smooth a wave of expected punitive action
against the brokerage house at the center of Wall Street's ongoing
criminal scandals, the regulators said.
   State securities laws bar convicted or admitted felons from
operating in the securities industry. Drexel has agreed to plead
guilty to six crimes to resolve a range of fraud charges brought by
the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.
   But legal challenges in New York to the federal judge who must
approve the criminal pact and the separate settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission are delaying resolution
indefinitely.
   Until Drexel formally enters a plea, states are powerless to try
to punish Drexel.
   ``The states can't do anything until there is an order issued on
some sort,'' Susan Bryant, Oklahoma's securities administrator, who
heads a panel of state regulators examining Drexel, said Thursday.
   But, she added, ``It probably will mean states will start
negotiating a settlement with Drexel even though there is no order
yet.''
   The state officials met privately to discuss Drexel during a
conference of the North American Securities Administrators
Association in Washington this week.
   Officials said they are studying punitive measures against
Drexel, including fines, suspensions and broad supervision, and
concessions that would permit the firm to retain brokers and do
business, such as municipal bonds, with towns and cities.
   States don't have to prove any individual investors bought stock
in companies tied to the frauds alleged by the government in its
settlements with the firm, but there is broad belief that citizens
in all states were affected.
   In addition to the legal challenge to the impartiality of U.S.
District Judge Milton Pollack, regulators predict that indicted
Drexel bond salesman Michael Milken will try to block release of
internal company documents that state officials may seek to obtain.
   While Drexel has agreed to cooperate with the states, if Milken
succeeds in freezing documents, state action could be further
delayed, said G.W. McDonald, assistant enforcement commissioner in
California's Department of Corrections.
   Regulators said they plan to let class-action suits cover claims
by investors who say they were defrauded by Drexel's actions. About
12 such suits have been filed around the nation to date, in states
including California, New York and Pennsylvania.
   Delaware, where Drexel remains a registered broker but has no
offices, could strip the firm's license to do business and levy
fines _ $10,000 per violation. The amount is dwarfed by the $650
million the firm has agreed to pay the federal government.
   ``If they're out of the retail business in Delaware it may not
be significant,'' said Richard Hubbard, Delaware's top securities
official. ``But if New York or California revokes their license,
that would be a big problem.''
   But Drexel has moved to avoid losing its license by selling
about half of its 43-office retail brokerage network _ which deals
directly with individual investors _ to Smith Barney, Harris Upham
Co. The rest of the department is still on the auction block.
   Some state regulators said they would follow the SEC's lead;
since the commission did not strip Drexel's license, they feel the
states shouldn't take superceding action.
   California, home to Drexel's high-yield junk bond division that
does hundreds of millions of dollars in business, has an
insider-trading statute similar to the SEC's and could bar certain
Drexel employees and restrain its business if it can trace parts of
the alleged frauds back to the state.
   But some regulators said they would consider the broad nature of
the SEC pact, which places Drexel under unprecedented supervision
for three years, when they take action.
   In addition, banishing Drexel from California, for example,
would take a huge chunk out of the state's securities industry.
   ``To the extent that they cleaned up their overall act, we have
to take that into account,'' California's McDonald said.
   Added John Baldwin, securities director for Utah: ``They paid
their pound of flesh, there are class action suits out there. Why
should I stab the dead?''

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf, `Preliminary results ...,' to CORRECT day of

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panhandle Eastern Corp. said Thursday it had
completed its $3.2 billion tender offer for Texas Eastern Corp. and
has accepted payment for about 81 percent of outstanding Texas
Eastern shares.
   The buyout puts an end to a rival bid from Coastal Corp. All the
natural gas companies are based in Houston.
   Preliminary results indicate that about 57 million Texas Eastern
shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the
midnight Wednesday expiration of Panhandle Eastern's offer.
   Panhandle Eastern's offer included provisions to buy up to 80
percent of Texas Eastern's 60.8 million outstanding shares and a
stock exchange at the same $53-per-share value for the remaining
shares.
   The combination of the two companies will create a 27,000-mile
system _ one of the nation's largest pipeline companies in terms of
miles.
   The battle for Texas Eastern began Jan. 16 when Coastal
announced its surprise takeover bid. But the Texas Eastern board
rejected the $2.6 billion offer as too low, signing the merger
agreement with Panhandle Eastern instead on Feb. 21.
   Coastal spokesman Robert W. Wells said the company would tender
its 2.5 million shares of Texas Eastern common stock.
   During Panhandle Eastern's stockholder meeting Wednesday,
Chairman Robert D. Hunsucker said about 500 corporate staff and
other headquarters office jobs would be eliminated after the merger.
   The cutbacks are needed to reduce operating costs of the
combined organization, and affect more than 20 percent of both
companies' work forces, Hunsucker said.
   Panhandle Eastern began buying shares of Texas Eastern stock
Thursday after the Federal Trade Commission cleared the way for the
two companies to proceed with their merger.

<HEAD>Channel One Schools Wait To See Ad-Free Turner Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the principals whose schools were part of
Whittle Communications' test of a commercially-sponsored news show
for teens are taking a wait-and-see approach to the prospect of a
rival, ad-free service.
   The comments Thursday followed cable executive Ted Turner's
announcement that he planned to launch a daily news show for
schools in August.
   The service resembles Whittle's Channel One program, which
recently completed a test run at six schools. But Turner's program
will contain no advertising while Channel One does.
   ``I don't know anything about the quality of the (Turner)
programming,'' said Principal Stan Jasinskas at Eisenhower Middle
School in Kansas City, Kan.
   John ``Rex'' Stooksbury, principal at Central High School in
Whittle's hometown of Knoxville, Tenn., also said he didn't want to
take a position on the Turner proposal before seeing the program.
   ``I don't want to close the door on any innovations that might
enhance our students' education, but I can't compare the two
because I haven't seen his program yet,'' he said.
   Channel One, a daily 12-minute news show aimed at teens, was
tested at Eisenhower, Central and four other schools over a
seven-week period ended last Friday. Each program contained two
minutes of commercials for jeans, sneakers, candy and other
products.
   The advertising sparked complaints from national education
groups, which said Whittle should not be allowed to sell a captive
student audience to big business.
   Whittle said the ads are needed to pay for the video recorders,
TV monitors in every classroom and satellite dishes that it gave
each of the participating schools so they could show the program
schoolwide every day.
   The company is evaluating the test results to determine whether
to expand the program nationally in the fall of 1990.
   But Turner, who heads Turner Broadcasting System Inc., said he
would start producing a 15-minute news show for schools on Aug. 14
and run it on his Cable News Network in the early morning hours
each school day so teachers could record it for later use in class.
   He said the program, CNN Newsroom, would carry no advertising, a
move that some cable industry insiders said could undercut support
for Whittle's ad-supported show and reassert Turner's prominence in
cable programming.
   Turner said he expected local cable operators would support his
program by making free cable connections to high schools and help
see that every school got a chance to receive the show.
   Eisenhower's Jasinskas said Turner's approach ``sounds like a
very interesting idea'' and said he would be open-minded about it.
   But he said the importance of giving schools equipment on the
scale of the Channel One program should not be underestimated when
comparing the Whittle and Turner offerings.
   Eisenhower High was given 40 television sets and Central High
got 70 from Channel One, and the principals said the schools might
not have otherwise obtained them.
   Central High's Stooksbury said his school had no problems with
the Channel One commercials anyway, and teachers and students miss
having the program.

   Another court battle involving Northwest
Airlines shaped up when state Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch
ordered Minnesota shareholders of the airline's parent not to sell
their shares to hostile suitor Marvin Davis.
   Minneapolis attorney Thomas A. Keller, who is representing Davis
in Minnesota, said he planned to file a lawsuit today in U.S.
District Court asking a judge to vacate the order issued Thursday
by Hatch.
   In a related development, a vote on a state anti-takeover bill
aimed at placing roadblocks in the way of Northwest suitors was
delayed by legislators' questions about the constitutionality of
the measure.
   Under Minnesota's existing anti-takeover law, Hatch can block a
securities offer within the state under certain conditions. His
order prevents the estimated 1,900 shareholders of NWA Inc. in the
state from selling their 1.3 million shares to Davis, whose offer
of $2.7 billion, or $90 a share, has been rejected by the NWA board.
   NWA Chairman Steven Rothmeier said Thursday the airline holding
company is aware of or four friendly potential suitors, but would
not identify them. He said a management-led buyout of Northwest,
the nation's fourth-largest carrier, is not in the works.
   Davis Acquisition Inc., the company Davis set up to bid for NWA,
said Hatch's suspension of its bid in Minnesota ``will only serve
to disadvantage and inconvenience'' Minnesota stockholders, who can
sell their shares only in the open market at a discount.
   But Hatch said the order could hamper Davis' ability to
negotiate loans to finance the purchase.
   ``The practical effect is that lenders don't like to make loans
to people who are in violation of securities laws,'' he said.
   Hatch said he would consider lifting the suspension at any time
if the billionaire oilman disclosed more details of his plan for
running the airline. The additional details which Davis supplied
Thursday did not satisfy his request, he said.
   Hatch is asking Davis to explain how he will operate the
carrier, based in suburban Eagan, without layoffs or cutbacks in
light of the major debt load he would incur through the takeover.
Davis has denied he would make such cutbacks.
   Keller maintained that Davis Acquisition's original financial
disclosure statement was sufficient under the state's anti-takeover
law. With additional information supplied at a Tuesday hearing and
on Thursday, Keller said, Davis more than fully satisfied the law's
disclosure requirements.
   No more disclosures will be made because that ``would require
getting into confidential, proprietary information that would put
us at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis other bidders,'' Keller said.
   The information submitted Thursday concerned Davis' intention to
substantially increase the capacity of passenger-seat miles over
the next six years, Keller said. Additionally, the information said
Davis intends to enhance the utilization of the aircraft's fleet by
improving scheduling, he said.
   On another front Thursday, the chairman of the state Senate
Judiciary Committee, Sen. Allan Spear of Minneapolis, said he would
give the anti-takeover bill another hearing due to the concerns
about constitutionality.
   The bill includes provisions that would:
   _Prevent a corporate raider from financing a takeover of a
company with a substantial connection to Minnesota by selling the
company's assets.
   _Give the Metropolitan Airports Commission power to approve an
acquisition of a major tenant of Minneapolis-St. Paul International
Airport, such as Northwest.
   _Impose a state excise tax on ``golden parachutes,'' the large
severance payments corporate executives receive if they are fired
or leave their jobs after their company is bought.
   Also Thursday, Northwest said U.S. District Judge Harry
MacLaughlin extended until May 11 his temporary restraining order
prohibiting Davis from ``disrupting'' contracts or contract
negotiations at Northwest. The order had been scheduled to expire
Thursday.

   Eastern Airlines wants to lease 14 planes to rival
Pan American World Airways as it begins its newly announced
restructuring plan.
   The $96.6 million, five-year lease would give Pan Am an option
to extend the lease or to buy the 727-200 planes at a price to be
negotiated, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said Thursday.
   The agreement must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
New York, which has had oversight of such deals since strike-torn
Eastern filed March 9 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   ``We had indicated we would be raising about $1.8 billion
through assets sales,'' Ms. Ceremsak said. ``This is certainly the
first step in this direction for the new, reduced-size airline.''
   Eastern President Phil Bakes described the planned restructuring
of Eastern on Monday, after parent Texas Air Corp. ruled out a sale
of Eastern. Bakes said Eastern would rebuild with a smaller airline
and address its debts by slashing service by 29 percent and selling
$1.8 billion worth of assets.
   Eastern's unions, on strike since March 4, continue to hope the
bankruptcy court and Eastern's creditors will call for sale of the
airline. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has set a Wednesday
hearing on why Eastern shouldn't be sold in its entirety to the
highest bidder.
   Ms. Ceremsak said there was considerable industry interest in
Eastern assets such as planes, gates and routes and that the
beleaguered company was receiving good offers.
   ``There's a tremendous demand right now for airplanes by other
carriers that are expanding,'' she said. ``The delivery positions
and orders are backed up in the factories.''
   She said she didn't have any information on other assets sales
in the works, but added: ``... there have been many interested
parties. Obviously, there are going to be other transactions.''
   Eastern's restructuring plan calls for a fleet of 157 aircraft.
If the 14 149-seat 727 planes are leased to Pan Am at $115,000 a
month and another 21 of the 727 planes are sold to New York
developer Donald Trump in the planned Northeast shuttle sale, that
would leave Eastern with 60 other ``excess aircraft for sale or
long-term lease,'' Ms. Ceremsak said.
   Pilots union spokesman J.B. Stokes said the unions oppose any
transfer of Eastern assets while hoping the bankruptcy court will
approve a buyout of the company.
   ``They can make all the plans they want,'' Stokes said. ``I
think they neglect to tell the people they must get approval from
the bankruptcy court. That's a fairly lengthy process and it's not
going to happen overnight.''
   The $365 million shuttle service sale also awaits approval by
the court, Stokes said.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has dealt a defeat to Texas
Air Corp., ordering arbitration in a dispute over seniority between
pilots for subsidiaries Continental Airlines and now-defunct People
Express Airlines.
   Texas Air bought People Express in early 1987 and merged it into
Continental, creating the problem of how to combine pilot seniority
lists.
   Pilots for People Express, which had been based in Newark, sued
Texas Air in U.S. District Court here, alleging that the
Houston-based airline company reneged on its promise to fairly
combine the lists or turn to arbitration. The promise had been a
key part of the labor protection agreement included in the Texas
Air-People Express deal.
   U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan heard three days of
testimony, including that of People Express founder and former
chairman Donald Burr, before ruling Monday.
   Politan found that Texas Air had ``decimated'' its own case
through vague and inconclusive testimony. The judge rejected an
argument by Texas Air that the labor protection agreement submitted
to the federal Department of Transportation was unsigned and
therefore not in force.
   He ordered both sides to submit court papers next week outlining
how the arbitration should be conducted.
   The issue of seniority is crucial to the 750 former People
Express pilots still with Texas Air and the 3,500 other Continental
pilots. It determines pay, flight schedules, vacation schedules,
where the pilots fly out of and the types of planes they fly, among
other factors.

   Federal regulators have taken over four more
insolvent savings and loan associations in three states, bringing
the total under government control to 220 in 32 states.
   The institutions _ two in California, one in New Jersey and one
in South Carolina _ were the latest to be taken over in a program
being administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The institutions will maintain normal operations and all
deposits continue to be protected up to the $100,000 insurance
limit, regulators said Thursday. Government regulatory teams will
work to minimize operating losses and ensure that the institutions
are operated in a sound manner, the FDIC said.
   The FDIC, which began the takeover program at the direction of
President Bush on Feb. 7, is assuming control of the sickest S&amp;Ls
in an effort to reduce losses while Congress puts together a
program to restructure and bail out the troubled industry.
   The four institutions involved in Thursday's action are
Southwest Savings and Loan Association, Los Angeles; Wesco Savings
Bank Federal Savings Bank, Wilmington, Calif.; Metropolitan Federal
Savings &amp; Loan Association, Denville, N.J.; and Seabank Savings
Federal Savings Bank, Myrtle Beach, S.C.

<HEAD>MCI Announces Cheaper Off-Hours Calling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. has unveiled a plan
that allows residential phone users to make an hour of interstate
long-distance calls, beginning at 7 p.m. weeknights, anywhere in
the country for $8 a month.
   Effective May 1, subscribers to the MCI Primetime plan announced
Thursday will get to make calls from 7 p.m. until 8 a.m. the
following day, all day Saturdays and Sundays until 5 p.m. at $8 an
hour and $6.80 for each additional hour.
   After the first hour, partial hours would be billed on a
pro-rated, per-minute basis. Callers also would get a 10 percent
discount for calls made at other times.
   A companion plan, MCI Supersaver, allows customers to make
interstate calls all day Saturday at $5 an hour.
   The company said the Supersaver plan is the lowest-priced
calling plan ever offered by any major long-distance company.
Neither plan applies to calls inside one state.
   ``It's the first to package the convenience and savings of MCI
long-distance in plans designed for when most consumers make their
calls,'' MCI President Bert Roberts said.
   ``You pay for the time _ the distance is free,'' said Timothy
Price, MCI vice president for consumer sales.
   Price said MCI's plan is better than the flat-rate Reach Out
America plan offered by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. because
prices are 10 percent to 20 percent lower, the plan is simpler,
there is no installation charge and it allows weeknight calling
four hours earlier (7 p.m. for MCI versus 11 p.m. for AT&amp;T).
   Merrill Tutton, AT&amp;T's vice president for consumer services,
said AT&amp;T will offer a promotion next week for Reach Out America
but has no plans to respond directly to MCI.
   ``Millions of customers have signed up for that plan'' and have
stayed with it because of AT&amp;T's quality of service and incentives
such as discounts to travelers calling home, Tutton said.
   AT&amp;T on April 1 dropped daytime prices by 4.2 percent, while
evening rates dropped 0.7 percent and night-weekend prices
decreased 0.3 percent.
   Reach Out America prices dropped 2.6 percent.
   Roberts said the new plan did not mean MCI was de-emphasizing
the business market. MCI's recent earnings successes has put the
company in a position ``to accelerate our efforts in the
residential area,'' he said.
   MCI reported record first quarter 1989 earnings of $128 million,
compared with $58 million a year earlier.

<HEAD>Treasury Says South Korea and Taiwan Should Do More on Currencies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea and Taiwan need to do more to
allow their currencies to rise in relation to the U.S. dollar as a
way of lowering huge trade surpluses the two nations are running
with the United States, according to a government report.
   The report the Treasury Department sent to Congress on Thursday
followed six months of negotiations the United States has held with
both countries.
   The United States has been pressuring the nations to allow their
currencies to rise in value in relation to the dollar as a way of
making their products more expensive on American markets and making
U.S. goods cheaper in their markets.
   While saying that both nations have made some progress in
boosting the value of their currencies, the report contended that
much more needs to be done.
   The department said it would press forward with the negotiations
in the hope of achieving further progress. The negative findings
were likely to increase pressure on the two governments in
Congress, where lawmakers have long been unhappy with the trade
practices of the two nations.
   Last October, an initial Treasury report had singled out Taiwan
and South Korea for ``manipulating'' their currencies to gain an
unfair competitive advantage in world markets.
   Taiwan and South Korea have for many years used part of the
money earned through their trade surpluses to buy and sell
currencies on the open market to have an impact on the price of
their own currencies in relation to the dollar.
   By keeping their currencies from rising as much against the
dollar as other currencies have, they have been able to keep the
prices of their exports to the United States from rising. The
practice has also made it harder for American industry to take
advantage of a cheaper dollar in selling goods to Taiwan and Korea.
   In 1988, the United States had a merchandise trade deficit of
$9.5 billion with South Korea and $13 billion with Taiwan, meaning
that the two countries accounted for 18 percent of America's total
trade deficit last year.
   The Treasury's ``Report to the Congress on International
Economic and Exchange Rate Policy,'' said that the assessment six
months ago that the U.S. trade deficit would continue to improve
this year had been clouded by recent developments, such as rising
oil prices.
   The Treasury did not forecast a new trade figure. However many
private analysts fear that the trade deficit, which dropped
dramatically in 1988 because of the decline of the value of the
dollar against many major currencies, could even begin rising again
unless the dollar fell further.
   The report was prepared under a provision of the Trade Act of
1988 which requires the administration to look for cases of
currency manipulation by American competitors in world trade and to
embark on bilateral negotiations to halt such practices.

   The Interior Department's Bureau of Land
Management has sold oil and natural gas exploration leases on
64,752 acres in six Southern states for $17.2 million.
   Some 325,000 acres _ mostly in national forests _ in Alabama,
Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia were offered
at Thursday's auction.
   Most of the income _ $16.8 million _ came from 28,279 acres in
the Ouachita and the Ozark national forests in Arkansas.
   The high bid was $2.5 million for a 600-acre tract in the
Ouachita National Forest by Santa Fe Pacific Exploration Co. of
Tulsa, Okla.
   Bureau spokesman Bob Ward said the five-year exploration leases
allow holders to look for oil and gas, but other permits are needed
to extract it.

<HEAD>Norway Regaining Footing After Economy Slipped On Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway is cautiously optimistic about its
economy, three bleak years after oil prices collapsed, teaching the
small Nordic country that its oil wealth is neither infinite nor
stable.
   ``The situation is better than expected. A budgeted 1989
current-account deficit of 11.1 billion kroner ($1.64 billion) may
become a surplus,'' Finance Minister Gunnar Berge said in a state
television interview.
   Tough government austerity measures, including wage controls,
helped cut annual inflation to 4.3 percent in March from a 10.4
percent peak two years earlier.
   Belt-tightening, improved oil prices and strong markets for its
metals, timber and shipping industries turned a $44.5 million
first-quarter 1988 trade deficit into a $1.4 billion surplus this
year, said officials.
   Experts expect Norway's gross national product to expand 1.9
percent in 1989, an improvement on 1988's 0.7 percent rate but well
off 1986's 4.2 percent figure.
   While Norway's economy is performing better in some areas than
its main trading partners', Bjoern Skogstad Aamo, the finance
minister's deputy, warned that ``economic uncertainty is still
genuine.''
   The country's unemployment rate reached a postwar record _ it
doubled in a year to about 4 percent last year _ as business
bankruptcies soared from 1,426 in 1986 to 3,891 last year and
consumer spending declined.
   The minority Labor Government, facing a Sept. 11 national
election under its traditional slogan, ``Employment For All,'' has
forwarded the most comprehensive jobs package in Norway's history.
   It also cut interest rates, which were hiked in 1987 to more
than 20 percent for some consumer loans, to stimulate the nation's
ailing construction, auto sales and other business.
   This coastal nation of 4.2 million people was unprepared for
oil's boom and bust when the 1969 discovery of rich offshore
reserves brought prosperity, nearly full employment and eventually
an overheated economy.
   In 1986, the 840,000 barrels of oil a day plus natural gas
Norway pumped represented 43 percent of its exports. Today it is
Europe's second-largest oil exporter, after Britain, at 1.4 million
barrels a day, but low crude prices cut oil's share of 1988 exports
to 35 percent.
   Oil wealth, relaxed credit and heavy private borrowing fanned an
unprecented consumer spending spree, which was abruptly
extinguished by low oil prices and high interest rates.
   ``Norway learned the painful lesson that easy oil money inflates
wages and costs ... at the expense of its traditional industries'
ability to compete internationally,'' said Roy Halvorsen, of the
Oslo Stock Exchange.
   ``The idealists in business are being replaced by leaders whose
goal is to turn a profit,'' he said.
   The business magazine Nordic Economic Outlook said Norway's
non-oil exports have increased 6 percent a year since 1986, partly
because ``the decline in domestic demand has forced manufacturers
to focus on production for export.''
   Berge said his 1990-1993 economic plan, due for parliamentary
review in May, will shield Norway from unstable oil prices and
dwindling petroleum reserves with an oil royalties trust, geared
toward stimulating traditional industry and research and toward
eliminating foreign debt by the year 2000.
   Any oil revenues exceeding 1989 budget estimates of $8.5
billion, based on $14 per barrel of oil, should go towards reducing
Norway's foreign debt, which stood at $17.5 billion in 1988, he
said.
   The Oslo Stock Market recovered from the October 1987 global
crash to set all-time records in April 1989, 10 percent above
pre-crash levels.

   The U.S. dollar was stable in thin European
trading today as the market settled down before a long holiday
weekend.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Traders said they expected the dollar to stay in a narrow
trading range unless the U.S. index of leading indicators, the only
significant economic news to be announced today, turned out to be a
surprise.
   Most traders expected the index, which was scheduled for release
this afternoon, to show a drop in March of about 0.5 percent,
following a decline of 0.3 percent in February.
   They said the dollar had appeared to have found a new trading
range for the time being.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6922, more expensive for
buyers than $1.6905 late Thursday.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8763 West German marks, up from 1.8756; 1.6625
Swiss francs, up from 1.6585; 6.3440 French francs, down from
6.3455; 2.1155 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1150; 1,373.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,373.50; and 1.1895 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1940.
   Earlier, the dollar rose in Tokyo to 132.49 Japanese yen from
132.05 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, the dollar edged
up further to 132.70 yen.
   Gold fell in Zurich to $380.50 a troy ounce, from $384.25 late
Thursday.
   In London, the metal opened at $381.50 a troy ounce, down from a
$384.25 late Thursday. At mid-morning, the city's bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $381.30.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $382.89, lower than
$385.71 Thursday.
   Silver bullion dipped in London to $5.63 a troy ounce, down from
$5.76 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>New York Bond House Settles SEC Fraud Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond dealer Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. has
agreed to settle civil fraud charges in connection with its
underwriting of more than $1 billion in municipal bonds and the
sale of 1.5 million shares of its own stock, the government said.
   Thursday's settlement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission capped the first phase of an intense federal
investigation into Matthews &amp; Wright's practices in selling
municipal issues.
   SEC officials said the ``investigation of related municipal
securities matters is continuing.''
   Without admitting or denying guilt, Matthews &amp; Wright, its
president and chairman, George W. Benoit, and Roger J. Burns, its
chief financial officer, agreed to settle civil charges brought by
the SEC that they violated anti-fraud and false-reporting
provisions of federal securities laws.
   Under the settlement, Manhattan-based Matthews &amp; Wright will
give up its broker-dealer license and agree to avoid future
securities violations.
   Benoit, 52, of Pearl River, will be barred from the securities
business for at least four years and Burns, 51, of Staten Island,
will be barred for at least two years.
   The settlement, which remains subject to approval by a federal
judge, was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   Two other men, Matthews &amp; Wright executive vice president Arthur
Abba Goldberg, 48, of Jersey City, N.J., and outside counsel
Bernard M. Altoff, 58, of Rye, were not parties to the settlement,
and civil charges were filed against them, the SEC said.
   The SEC complaint charged that the four individuals and Matthews
&amp; Wright carried out a fraud scheme to underwrite tax-exempt
municipal securities ``through a series of sham closings'' to
retain favorable tax treatment.
   The complaint also charged that Matthews &amp; Wright made false and
misleading statements about the sham transactions to the SEC and to
the investing public when the firm sold 1.5 million shares of its
common stock in August 1986.
   The charges in the government's case stem from 26 municipal bond
deals in 1985 and 1986. The firm has been out of the bond
underwriting business for more than two years since its legal
troubles began.
   According to the SEC's complaint, Matthews &amp; Wright, used
worthless checks to ``buy'' 26 municipal bond issues totaling $1.32
billion in December 1985 and August 1986 before a federal tax
loophole was closed, making the bonds less attractive to investors.
   ``No real purchase occurred and they missed the tax deadline,''
explained David W. Parsons, senior counsel for the SEC in
Washington. According to the complaint, he added, investors were
not getting the tax-exempt municipal securities they thought they
were buying.
   Gary Sundick, the SEC's assistant director of enforcement,
noted, however, ``the commission is not making a determination as
to taxability of interest on the bonds.'' That was up to the
Internal Revenue Service, he said, adding that the circumstances of
the bond sales ``created increased risks concerning taxation which
should have been disclosed'' to investors.
   The complaint charged that the worthless checks were kept out of
normal banking channels and the bonds were warehoused through a
banking concern on the Pacific island of Saipan until Matthews &amp;
Wright sold them to the public.
   Last year a federal grand jury in Guam charged Goldberg with
fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. The case has since been
transferred to California.
   The SEC case does not involve the firm's best-known deals, $380
million in issues underwritten for Guam and the Northern Marianas
in 1984 and 1985, officials said.
   In addition, the SEC complaint charged that proceeds from 17 of
the 26 bond issues were used to buy guaranteed investment contracts
to ensure repayment of interest on the bonds, rather than for their
stated purpose: to finance construction projects _ including
low-income housing.
   SEC officials would not comment on whether the projects were
bogus from the start.

   The board of directors of R.P. Scherer Corp.
has received several purchase offers, including one from a West
German company that owns more than 5 percent of Scherer.
   The board announced Thursday it would discuss all bids for the
gelatin capsule maker, but declined to say how many have been
received or what terms were being offered.
   Scherer spokeswoman Jayne Colombo said the board could meet as
early as today.
   Colombo also said Deutsche Gelatine-Fabriken Stoess and Co.,
which owns more than 5 percent of Scherer, had filed papers with
the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington saying it had
offered to buy the company.
   Earlier this month, Scherer told shareholders it was seeking
buyers. The letter said the company anticipated that a sale could
be completed by the end of May or shortly afterward.
   Former Scherer President Peter Fink quit the company in a battle
with his estranged wife, Karla Scherer Fink, over its sale. He
formed another company, Quantum Corp. of St. Clair Shores and has
said he would try to buy Scherer.
   Peter Fink and Quantum spokesman Frank Bredell were not
available Thursday afternoon, said a woman who answered the Quantum
telephone.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Shrinks In Fiscal 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's current account surplus shrank 8.9 percent
in 1988, the second straight year in which the surplus in the broad
trade measure has contracted, the Finance Ministry said Friday.
   Analysts said the decline, to $76.97 billion in fiscal 1988 from
1987's $84.47 billion, was an encouraging sign for Japan, which is
trying to reduce its trade imbalance to ease tensions with its
trading partners.
   The current account is a comprehensive measurement of a nation's
international trade flows and includes imports and exports of goods
and services, earnings and expenditures on tourism, financial
investments and other transactions.
   The ministry said import growth outpaced export growth in the
fiscal year, which ended March 31. Imports grew 23.3 percent to
$171.83 billion from $139.40 billion the previous year, while
exports rose 14.4 percent to $267.10 billion from $233.44 billion.
   Strong domestic demand for manufactured goods helped boost
imports, ministry officials said.
   Japan's current account surplus for March, announced at the same
time, shrank to $6.32 billion from $8.33 billion a year earlier,
the ministry said. The surplus was also smaller than February's
$7.71 billion.
   Both exports and imports in the current account balance are
measured when contracts are settled, and are different from the
customs-clearance trade statistics that the ministry announces
separately each month.
   The ministry announcement did not include breakdowns of trade
figures by country or region.

   U. Edwin Garrison has been selected president and
chief executive officer of the new Thiokol Corp., the company to be
formed when Morton Thiokol Inc.'s aerospace and specialty chemical
divisions are separated.
   Garrison, 61, will be joined at the head of the new company by
Robert T. Marsh, 64, a retired U.S. Air Force general who was named
chairman of Thiokol's new board of directors, said spokesman Nancy
Hobor.
   Marsh is now a member of Morton Thiokol's board.
   Pending stockholder approval, Morton Thiokol Inc. will split to
become Morton International Inc. and Thiokol Corp. on July 1.
Morton International will contain the commercial businesses of
specialty chemicals, air bags for auto mobiles and salt.
   The split, proposed in late March, was described by industry
analysts as a move to separate two diverse business operations.
   Thiokol will include the company's aerospace operations. Morton
Thiokol employs 8,000 people in Utah, mostly at operations west of
Brigham City and at aerospace division headquarters in Ogden.
   Morton Thiokol is based in Chicago, which will remain the
corporate home of the new Morton International Inc. Charles S.
Locke, who is now chairman of Morton Thiokol, will become chairman
and chief executive officer of Morton International.
   Garrison is now president of the Aerospace Group of Morton
Thiokol, and is the corporation's vice president, positions he
assumed in 1983.
   A graduate of Mississippi State University and a native of
Alabama, he lives in Ogden.
   Marsh retired from the Air Force in 1984. In addition to Morton
Thiokol, he serves on the boards of Cimflex Teknowledge Corp., CAE
Link Corp. and ITHACO Corp. and as a trustee of MITRE Corp. He
lives in Alexandria, Va.

<HEAD>A Bull Market Comeback?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Did the great bull market on Wall Street
secretly survive the crash of 1987?
   Has it now, as in some science-fiction movie sequel, crawled out
of the disaster's rubble and begun to prowl the canyons of Wall
Street once more?
   Those questions are being raised in many investors' minds as the
rally in stock prices that began in the waning weeks of 1987
carries to new high after new high.
   As of late last week the Dow Jones industrial average stood
nearly 700 points, or 40 percent, above its low on Black Monday Oct
19, 1987.
   A 40 percent rise in 18 months compares pretty favorably with
many a past rally that earned the ``bull market'' stamp. As if to
confirm its status, the economy has kept growing at a robust rate,
showing scarcely any effects from a very scary financial event.
   But one prominent money manager contends that people who think
this way might be falling into a dangerous trap.
   If you judge the stock market by price alone, the bull appears
to have revived, concedes Henry Gailliot, senior vice president at
Pittsburgh-based Federated Research Corp., which manages assets
totaling $37 billion.
   When you apply other traditional criteria, however, ``it doesn't
look at all like a bull market,'' Gailliot said in an interview.
   In a bull market, he says, a broad array of stocks should be
rising to keep pace with the narrow sample represented by the Dow
Jones industrials. But that hasn't been happening.
   While the averages have hit new post-crash highs, the number of
individual stocks at new 52-week peaks has been unimpressive, he
adds.
   ``Volume is not rising with price,'' he also observes. ``The
rally to date continues to have the characteristics of a bear
market rally. We expect a new low (below DJIA 1740) in price before
this bear market is over.''
   For some time now Gailliot, like many other economists, has been
predicting a recession that has yet to give any sign of showing up.
   What has confounded the forecasters, he says, has been
persistent strength in spending by consumers, long since
overextended by the usual yardsticks.
   Since consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic
activity, ``the consumer is the `gorilla' of our economy,'' he
observes.
   ``If you don't get the consumer right, you don't get the
business cycle right.''
   Consumers' ability to keep spending has been stretched in the
1980s, Gailliot says, by devices such as low- (or no-) rate auto
financing and home equity lines of credit. ``These are marvelous
innovations that do nothing but let the consumer go farther out on
the limb.''
   At some point, he says, consumers will reach the stage where
they want or are forced to retrench.
   ``When the gorilla decides how much is enough,'' he says, ``then
you get a recession.''

   The stock market was mixed today, hesitating
after Thursday's rally to new post-crash highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.38 to 2,421.37 in
the first half hour of trading.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 446 up, 519 down and
491 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.55 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the index of
leading economic indicators fell 0.7 percent in March, following a
0.3 percent decline the month before.
   The latest figure slightly exceeded the consensus estimate on
Wall Street, and provided new evidence of the kind of slowing in
business activity that many investors have been hoping for.
Interest rates fell in the credit markets on the news.
   Analysts said the response in the stock market was muted,
however, by some misgivings about the potential implications of the
figures for corporate earnings.
   In addition, brokers said traders were a bit leery of chasing
after a rally that has proceeded for more than a month with few
interruptions.
   Ford Motor dropped { to 47]. On Thursday the company reported
higher first-quarter profits, but said its earnings for the full
year might not equal the record total reported for 1988.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .02 to 173.04. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .29 at 344.46.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 29.88 to
2,418.99.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,005 up, 464 down and 484 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 191.17 million shares, against 146.09
million in the previous session.

   Congress may subpoena Bush administration
officials as part of its inquiry into why a popular program that
subsidizes food exports has apparently been halted with no official
notice.
   Though the Agriculture Department denies that the Export
Enhancement Program has been stopped, no sales using it have been
completed since February. And lawmakers allege that a
just-announced grain sale to the Soviets will be unsubsidized.
   ``Since the program started there has never been a two-month
hiatus,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., who heads the House
Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains.
   The holdup appears to be with the Office of Management and
Budget, where officials say a review of the program is taking place.
   When OMB representatives failed to appear before his
subcommittee Thursday, Glickman said he may have subpoena them.
   He said the administration's budget writers first would be given
a chance to answer questions in writing, but would be expected to
``respond quickly and satisfactorily.''
   Kelly Shipp, press secretary to Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter, said the program has slowed down because of weather and
stock conditions and because there is a new administration, but it
has not been suspended.
   Thomas Scully, associate director for legislative affairs at
OMB, said director Richard Darman couldn't make the hearing because
he had another obligation and no other policymaker at the budget
office was qualified to speak.
   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department announced Thursday that
the Soviet Union, will be allowed to purchase 24 million metric
tons of grain this year instead of the 20 million previously
negotiated. Lawmakers said the additional sales will not be
subsidized.
   Only wheat has been subsidized in the grain sales to the Soviet
Union. Huge amounts of corn have been sold to the Soviets without
subsidies.
   The USDA also said U.S. and Soviet negotiators concluded a
two-day meeting about commodity purchases under a long-term grain
agreement that specifies regular sales of grain and soybeans during
the year. The pact calls for such meetings twice a year.
   In a separate announcement, USDA said the Soviet Union has
bought an additional 150,000 tons of corn, which boosted total
Soviet purchases of U.S. corn to 13.4 million tons. Moscow also has
bought 4 million tons of wheat for delivery through Sept. 30, the
end of the agreement's sixth year.
   According to USDA, the Soviets also have bought 450,000 tons of
soybeans, nearly 1.4 million tons of soybean meal and 507,400 tons
of grain sorghum for 1988-89 delivery.
   But a member of Glickman's subcommittee said the Soviets went
away from negotiations angry.
   The Soviets wanted to expand the amount to 30 million tons under
the Export Enhancement Program, but were told their purchases would
have to be unsubsidized, said Rep. David Nagle, D-Iowa.
   Attempts to contact Soviet officials at their embassy in
Washington were unsuccessful.
   Shipp said the agreement does not stipulate whether the EEP will
be used during the sale. She said the talks were about the amount
of grain the Soviets could buy, not its price.
   The EEP was started four years ago to entice foreign buyers who
were being lured away by countries that charged cheaper prices
because of heavy government subsidies.
   Through the program, buyers are given bonus quantities of
commodities if they buy a certain amount. The commodities come from
the surplus stock purchased previously by the federal government
from American farmers through other agricultural support programs.
   The fate of the EEP has been in question since April 18 when
Thomas Kay, the foreign agriculture service administrator, told a
Senate subcommittee that the agriculture department must hold all
new EEP initiatives until the program had been reviewed by the OMB.
   The Agriculture Department says that under the program $8
billion in farm products have been sold, including wheat, wheat
flour, vegetable oil, barley, barley malt, semolina, sorghum, rice,
poultry feed, dairy cattle, eggs and frozen poultry.
   Congress considers the program vital to U.S. strength during
international trade negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round, which
have been going on in Geneva.
   The U.S. position is that countries should remove or drastically
reduce subsidies that distort world prices and Congress believes
that the EEP puts the United States in a stronger bargaining
position.

<HEAD>Black &amp; Decker Wins 95 Percent of Emhart Stock in Tender Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black &amp; Decker Corp. said today it received
95 percent of the stock of Emart Corp. in a tender offer, enough to
complete a $2.8 billion takeover of the diversified manufaturing
company.
   Black &amp; Decker offered Emart shareholders $40 a share for their
stock. Based on a preliminary count today, about 95 percent of
Emart's outstanding shares were tendered under the offer, which
expired this morning.
   Black &amp; Decker will now authorize its banks to begin paying
shareholders. Although Emhart in effect comes under Black &amp; Decker
control today, the actual merger will take about 60 days to
complete, said Barbara Lucas, a Black &amp; Decker spokeswoman.
   Emhart shareholders who do not sell their stock to Black &amp;
Decker will be able to get $40 a share once the merger is final.
   Black &amp; Decker manufactures power tools and products for the
home and commercial applications.
   Emhart manufactures industrial and consumer products and
information electronic systems. The company makes Kwik Set locks,
True Temper tools, sporting goods, faucets, staplers, commercial
hardware and footwear materials.
   Black &amp; Decker has said it plans to sell Emhart's electronics
division, estimated to be worth $500 million, to help pay for the
acquisition.
   Analysts say Black &amp; Decker should be able to handle the debt,
but the company is not expected to turn a profit for about a year
and a half.
   Emhart had been fighting an unsolicited $2.4 billion takeover
offer from Topper L.P., a New York-based investment group that
includes oil heir Gordon P. Getty and the Fisher real estate family
of New York. The Topper offer amounted to $35 a share.
   Topper sold its Emhart shares late last month, effectively
ending its bid.
   Black &amp; Decker has been searching for a means to expand its
market after failing to take over two other companies.
   Last year the company tried to take over American Standard Inc.,
a New York-based maker of plumbing, heating and air-conditioning
equipment, but dropped the hostile offer after it was outbid by the
New York investment firm Kelson &amp; Co. Black &amp; Decker offered $2.4
billion for that company.
   In February, Black &amp; Decker's attempts to acquire Oster-Sunbeam
appliances were thwarted when Oster-Sunbeam's parent company,
Allegheny International Inc., accepted another offer.
   Black &amp; Decker offered $260 million for the Oster-Sunbeam
subsidiary.

<HEAD>EDS: ADDS final graf to UPDATE with Pritzker reportedly submitting

<TEXT>
   As the strike gripping Eastern Airlines
approaches the end of its second month, boss Frank Lorenzo is
hanging tough.
   After rejecting buyout proposals and producing his own plan to
shrink the airline, Lorenzo seems to be playing a waiting game with
striking employees, who after nearly two months on the picket lines
may be under increasing pressure to find jobs again.
   Lorenzo also must contend with Eastern's creditors and with a
federal bankruptcy judge, who must approve the downsizing plan and
is pushing for a sale of Eastern in its entirety.
   ``It really continues to be a game of brinksmanship,'' said
Robert Decker, an airline industry analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
in Chicago.
   The strike has become the longest major walkout against a U.S.
airline since the industry was deregulated in October 1978.
   After a 17-month wage dispute, Eastern's militant Machinists
struck the Miami-based carrier on March 4 and were joined by pilots
and flight attendants, virtually grounding the airline.
   Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., put
Eastern into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors on
March 9.
   Employees' hopes were stirred April 6 when a group led by
ex-baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth agreed to buy Eastern
for $464 million. Hopes soared a few days later when the unions
agreed to accept $210 million in wage concessions in exchange for a
30 percent stake in the carrier under the Ueberroth deal.
   But the proposal collapsed over the unions' demand that a
powerful trustee be appointed to replace Lorenzo as head of Eastern
before Ueberroth took over _ a term the Texas Air chief flatly
rejected.
   Lorenzo now insists that a sale of Eastern in its entirety no
longer is an option _ neither side will back down from their
trustee positions _ although billionaire hotel executive Jay
Pritzker, Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl C. Icahn and others
have expressed buyout interest.
   Instead, the airline on Monday detailed plans to operate at
one-third its pre-strike size and raise $1.8 billion by selling
assets, including planes, airport gates and landing slots at
unspecified locations.
   ``I think that was (Lorenzo's) intention all along,'' said
Andrew Geller, who follows the industry for Provident National Bank
in Philadelphia.
   As a first step, Eastern announced Thursday that it plans to
lease 14 Boeing 727-200s to Pan American World Airways for $96.6
million over five years, subject to bankruptcy court approval.
   Eastern is expected to announce more deals for leasing and
selling aircraft in the coming days, according to sources close to
the company.
   The plan is reminiscent of what Lorenzo did with Eastern's
sister carrier Continental Airlines in September 1983.
   After he put Continental into Chapter 11, he slashed the number
of employees to around 4,000 from 12,500 and brought the airline
out of bankruptcy protection as a non-union carrier.
   Now, due to 1985 amendments to the bankruptcy laws, Lorenzo
would first have to negotiate further with Eastern unions and
demonstrate that he had no alternative but to cut jobs.
   Some experts say Lorenzo's downsizing strategy could be aimed at
luring back striking pilots, who would lose seniority if they took
jobs at rival carriers.
   Under the plan, which would cut Eastern jobs from the pre-strike
31,200 to around 17,000, management reckons it would need about
1,700 pilots. The airline says it is hiring and training new pilots
at the rate of around 200 a month.
   ``It's the airline version of voodoo economics,'' said Jack
Bavis, head of Eastern's pilots union. ``And it's also designed to
intimidate the 3,300 Eastern pilots into abandoning the picket line
and returning to work.''
   Some observers say it may be difficult for Lorenzo to convince
creditors and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland that the
airline will be able to recruit 1,700 pilots in a reasonable period
of time.
   Joel Zweibel, the lead attorney for the committee representing
Eastern's creditors, told The Associated Press the panel would need
about two weeks to form a judgment on Eastern's plan.
   There are still rumblings about a possible sale of the entire
airline.
   Lifland plans to hold a twice-postponed hearing next Wednesday
on the issue of selling Eastern in its entirety, icluding its
Northeast shuttle service the company already has agreed to sell to
developer Donald Trump for $365 million.
   Union officials and financial advisers continue to screen
potential bidders for Eastern; union sources said Thursday they
have held discussions with five suitors they consider credible.
   The pilots union leadership told its members late Thursday that
Pritzker has submitted his bid for the carrier and that Icahn has
requested confidential financial information from the bankruptcy
court as a prelude to making his buyout offer.

<HEAD>America West Chief Paints Grim Picture of U.S. Air Industry Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reregulation is a real prospect facing
the domestic airline industry if current trends continue unabated,
an airline executive warned.
   Edward Beauvais, chairman of Phoenix-based America West
Airlines, painted a generally grim picture of the industry's
future, with fewer owners meaning lessened competition and higher
fares.
   Beauvais told the Aviation-Space Writers Association's annual
news conference Thursday that deregulation initially created a
highly competitive industry with low fares and a robust growth rate.
   But he said competitive balance has been destroyed by the
concentration of ownership.
   In addition, he said, entry barriers to gaining a market share
such as sophisticated computer reservation systems, access to
restricted airports such as New York City's LaGuardia and
Washington's National, and multibillion-dollar orders for new
planes by the major airlines have made it even more difficult for
the smaller carriers.
   ``If something isn't done, you've got an oligopoly with very
high fares and little competition,'' Beauvais said.
   That could create ``a groundswell of public opinion that could
mean the industry could experience reregulation,'' he said. ``If
the barrier-to-entry problems are not resolved, that will happen.''
   Beauvais said concern over the situation is starting to register
in Washington, but that it will take such things as ``even higher
prices, and they're going to get a lot higher, and several major
failures,'' to bring concerted reform efforts.
   The ongoing problems of strikebound Eastern Airlines, including
unsuccessful sale efforts amid Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization, are part of that, he added. ``It's riveting the
attention of Washington on our industry right now,'' he said.
   Beauvais said he does not think the airline will fly again.
``I'm not sure Eastern can be successful as a smaller company,'' he
said. Eastern's management recently proposed a plan to rebuild as a
smaller carrier and sell around $1.8 billion in assets.
   As for his own 5-year-old airline, Beauvais said, ``We're not a
buyer and we're not a seller. We certainly don't think a hostile
takeover would be possible. We're not a classic target.''
   America West posted a $10.07 million first-quarter profit on
Wednesday, compared with a $16.32 million loss for the same period
last year.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on
the Chicago Board of Trade as a steady rain fell on areas of Iowa
and Illinois.
   The rain has given rise to sentiment that the drought that has
plagued the area is over.
   ``We've had the best rain in Illinois in two years,'' said John
Frazier of Balfour Maclaine Corp. in Chicago. ``A lot of people are
saying the drought is over, and that's what's been supporting us
for a long time.''
   Soybean prices also are being affected by word that a Brazilian
dock strike is breaking up. Dockworkers gave their tentative
approval to a court-ordered pay raise.
   Uncertainty over the Bush administration's position on
continuing subsidized grain sales to foreign countries is putting
pressure on wheat prices.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.03{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
1{ cents lower with May at $2.67{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 3\

cents lower with May at $7.23 a bushel.
   Cattle prices were higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in
early trading, while pork prices were mostly lower.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .38 cent higher with June at 71.20
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .80 cent higher with
May at 76.25 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with June at 46.80 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.02 cent to .32 cent lower with May at 32.05 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The historic firearms business that gave
Colt Industries Inc. its name will be sold, company officials in
New York announced today.
   Colt is attempting to find a buyer for Colt Firearms, which
employs 1,100 workers at two plants in West Hartford and Hartford,
spokesman Michael G. Dunn said.
   The firearms division, which has been mired in a
3-three-year-old strike, also recently lost its contract to
manufacture M-16 rifles for the military. But Dunn said neither was
a factor in today's announcement.
   Colt management decided the company should focus on its
aerospace, automobile and industrial services sectors, Dunn said.
   Dunn refused to disclose sales and revenue figures for the
firearms division. Colt Industries, based in New York, is a
privately-held company and does not publicly disclose its financial
statements.
   Workers at the Colt plants in Connecticut were informed of the
company's plans today.
   Robert Madore, president of striking United Auto Workers Local
376, was not in his office and not immediately available for
comment, his secretary said.
   Colt was founded in 1836 in Hartford by Samuel Colt, the
inventor of the famous Colt .45 handgun. The company now makes
rifles and handguns for military and domestic use.
   Dunn said he expected a purchaser of the gun manufacturer to
retain the Colt name.

<HEAD>Kohlberg Completes RJR Nabisco Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The maverick buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
&amp; Co. said today it has completed its record $24.53 billion
acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Trading in the company's stock on the New York Stock Exchange
was to cease at the end of the day.
   The completion of the deal that stunned Wall Street came a day
after shareholders formally approved the buyout at a special
meeting in Wilmington, Del. Company officials said about 85 percent
of RJR Nabisco's shares were voted in favor of the merger.
   Separately, RJR Nabisco announced Thursday that it would move
its headquarters from Atlanta to the New York City area by the end
of the year so the food-and-tobacco giant can be in close contact
with the financial community.
   The company will decide over the next few weeks whether layoffs
are necessary, said Pauline Howes, an RJR Nabisco spokeswoman.
About 450 RJR Nabisco employees work in Atlanta, she said.
   The move would be the second for RJR Nabisco corporate
headquarters in recent years. Former RJR President F. Ross Johnson
moved the headquarters from Winston-Salem to Atlanta after he took
over following the merger of R.J. Reynolds Industries Inc. and
Nabisco Brands Inc. in 1985.
   RJR Nabisco said its new chairman, Louis Gerstner Jr., sent a
letter to employees saying the plans of the firm can ``best be
achieved by maintaining close ongoing contact with the investment
banking community and other New York-based segments of the business
community.''
   The letter said relocations could begin by early summer and
would be completed by the end of the year.
   The exact location of RJR Nabisco's headquarters was not
announced. However, the firm's Nabisco Brands division is based in
New Jersey, also near New York.

   The seven regional Bell phone companies would
be allowed to manufacture telecommunications equipment and begin
offering information services such as electronic yellow pages,
computer data bases and home shopping and banking under a bill
introduced in the House.
   The bill, co-sponsored Thursday by Reps. Al Swift, D-Wash., and
Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, would lift some restraints that were imposed on
the companies when the Bell System was broken up by a federal
consent decree in 1984.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., introduced a non-binding resolution
in the House last year that called for allowing the Baby Bells back
into manufacturing and information services, and it had 205
co-sponsors.
   The Bell companies claim federal regulation is limiting U.S.
telecommunications competitiveness overseas and is depriving
consumers of the latest in communications advances.
   ``Other countries are racing ahead with telecommunications
research and development, but we stand with our hands tied behind
our back,'' Tauke said in a statement.
   Pacific Telesis Group Chairman Sam Ginn called the bill a
``milestone in the history of telecommunications policy'' and
commended Congress ``for taking this first step toward bringing
U.S. consumers and businesses time-saving conveniences and
competitive tools that other countries now enjoy.''
   Nynex Corp. said lifting the restrictions was ``essential to the
enhancement of competition in both domestic and global markets.''
   Ameritech Chairman William L. Weiss said it was ``a critically
important step forward.''
   BellSouth Corp. also hailed the bill, but said it also imposes
restrictions ``that will further delay the wide availability of
information services, including the provision of electronic
publishing.''
   Jerry W. Friedheim, president of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association, which would face heavy competition in
electronic classified ads, said the bill ``would result in less _
not more _ information being provided to American homes
electronically.''
   The Swift-Tauke measure includes provisions designed to protect
consumers, and orders the FCC to assure compliance.
   The Bell companies must provide other information service
providers with non-discriminatory access to their phone lines.
   The FCC must determine that a Bell company does not hold
monopoly power over electronic publishing services such as
electronic yellow pages or telephone exchange service in its area.
It also limits revisions to the yellow pages to once a month for
the first two years.
   The Bell companies could provide electronic publishing outside
their service areas without restriction.
   The bill would supersede U.S. District Judge Harold Greene's
oversight of the Bell companies, said Ed Senn, an aide to Tauke.
   It would not apply to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., nor
would it repeal restrictions on telephone companies from providing
cable TV programming, Senn said.
   AT&amp;T has opposed the regional Bell companies' entry into
long-distance and manufacturing as long as they retain control over
local phone networks. AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said AT&amp;T didn't
think the bill was necessary because the consent decree was working.
   Linnen said it was ``startling'' that one part of the bill
``appears to exempt the telephone companies from antitrust law with
respect to some of the activities they want to enter.''
   ``The bill's attempts to prescribe certain safeguards against
abuse in manufacturing and information services strike us as
futile, given the bill's other provisions that would remove
antitrust protections,'' Linnen said.
   The bill also requires the Bell companies to provide
non-discriminatory procurement in the manufacture of telephone
equipment, and bars the phone companies from using proceeds from
regulated telephone service to subsidize information services or
manufacturing, and vice versa.
   The FCC also must assure that telephone customers do not pay for
failed information services or manufacturing ventures and that
investment costs cannot be assigned to phone customers unless the
customers will benefit.
   The bill also requires the FCC to regulate any transfer of
assets between enterprises or credit arrangements.
   The bill calls for unspecified penalties and fines for
violations.

<HEAD>Former Teamsters President Roy Williams Dies</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs of background. No pickup. Also moved on general
news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LEETON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Teamsters president Roy Lee Williams
died today at his farm home after a lengthy bout with emphysema and
heart problems.
   Williams, 73, was released from federal prison in September
after serving three years of a 10-year sentence for attempting to
bribe a senator over trucking legislation.
   Williams served as international president of the Teamsters
union from 1981-83.
   He was forced to resign as Teamsters chief after he and four
co-defendants were convicted in December 1982 for trying to bribe
former U.S. Sen. Howard Cannon of Nevada to influence trucking
deregulation. Cannon was not charged in the case.
   Though he maintained his innocence during the 1982 trial,
Williams acknowledged his role in the conspiracy case during
testimony in 1985 in a Kansas City trial. He was cooperating with
federal authorities investigating the mob in an attempt to have his
own sentence reduced.
   Williams testified that while he was a Kansas City labor leader
before his elevation to the Teamsters presidency, he had been under
the control of Nick Civella, the reputed crime boss in Kansas City
at the time.
   He said he received payoffs of $1,500 a month from Civella for
seven years until he became Teamsters president. He said Civella,
who has since died, played a key role in his election to the union
presidency.
   Williams also testified by videotape in a federal court trial in
New York against mob fitures accused of fixing his election as
Teamsters president, and that of his successor, Jackie Presser, who
died last July. Three co-defendants were acquitted of that charge
in May 1988, but convicted of unrelated charges.

   The Oliver North trial jury began its second
week of deliberations Friday, yielding no signal on its progress:
no notes, no words to the judge and no requests for clarifications
or to rehear testimony.
   There also was no word on the jurors' intentions for a Saturday
session. Last week, a day after receiving the case, the jury
deliberated for 3{ hours in the morning, then took the rest of the
weekend off.
   The jurors' schedule has not varied. It begins with their
arrival from a downtown hotel at 8:20 a.m., then juice and pastry
and a 9 a.m. start. At noon a caterer arrives with lunches chosen
individually by each juror from a menu.
   On Friday, the order got mixed up _ the caterer delivered the
wrong lunches _ and the jurors went back to work until 12:30 when
the right food arrived.
   North took advantage of the jury's 9-to-4 pace on Thursday with
a quick trip to deliver a speech to the Bankers Club of Cincinnati,
presumably for the same $20,000-$25,000 fee he has received for
other recent appearances.
   The former National Security Council aide spoke about
traditional values and received a standing ovation, according to
Bankers Club members who heard his speech.
   Steven Doherty, an Ohio State University sophomore from
Cincinnati, said North spoke highly of former President Reagan, the
club's next scheduled guest, booked for September.
   Protesters picketed outside the club before the speech.
   ``We don't care whether North sees us or not,'' said Roy Silver,
organizer for the Central American Task Force. ``We're
demonstrating against the Bankers (Club) for giving him $25,000
while there are homeless people in this city sleeping on the
streets.''
   The Bankers Club did not disclose North's fee.
   ``You're all a bunch of pro-communists'' shouted a well-dressed
businessman at the demonstrators.
   The North jury has before it 12 criminal charges, most of which
accuse North of lying or withholding information about his and the
NSC's support for the guerrillas fighting the leftist Nicaraguan
government.
   North is accused of lying to Congress to cover up his role in
secretly assisting the Contras and lying to the attorney general
about aspects of the diversion of funds to the Contras from the
Iran arms sales. He also faces charges that he accepted a $13,800
home security system and converted $4,300 in traveler's checks from
a Contra leader to his own use.
   Meanwhile, a two-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals
rejected a petition by 10 news organizations seeking access to a
stipulation that was presented to the jury at the end of the trial
but not made available to the public.
   The appeals court sent the issue back to the judge in the North
case for a hearing on national security issues involved, saying it
cannot make a decision without having such a record.
   The stipulation summarizes highly secret intelligence
interceptions concerning a CIA-assisted November 1985 shipment of
Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran. North's lawyers referred in
closing arguments to the stipulation in an effort to show that
knowledge about the operatiion was not limited to North but was
known widely among top U.S. officials.

   A $400 million blend of big-league
filming and Hollywood stargazing debuts Monday when Florida's top
entertainment resort opens the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, a
135-acre playground with diversions that range from do-it-yourself
music videos to a 1950s sitcom set.
   The complex at Walt Disney World combines working movie-TV sound
studios with backstage tours for the public, a mixed-media
ride-through show and other special effects adventures.
   ``It is a theatrical environment that is very close to the
original conception by Walt Disney,'' Michael Eisner, Walt Disney
Co. chairman, said in an interview. ``It's been on the shelf since
the 1940s and is the culmination of a company dream. This
attraction is unlike anything else we have.''
   It's all themed to the golden age of Hollywood in the 1930s and
1940s, when tyrannical cigar-chomping moguls ran studios and art
deco dominated the building scape.
   Mom, dad and the kids can walk through re-creations of
palm-lined Hollywood Boulevard and Grauman's Chinese Theater, peek
at movies under production, take a role in a television show, make
their own music videos, get a screen test and rub elbows with the
stars at the Brown Derby restaurant.
   Movie and TV production began last summer with the ``Superboy''
syndicated TV series and parts of several large-screen films while
construction continued on the tourist portion.
   The event was preceded by glitzy parties and previews that
included a television special, a parade of famous Hollywood actors
and actresses on the boulevard and live tapings of a mew ``Mickey
Mouse Club'' TV series.
   Dick Nunis, president of Walt Disney Attractions, said he
believes bringing a bit of Hollywood to Florida will reinvigorate
the resort, already visited annually by an estimated 25 million
people that reportedly pump about $2 billion into the area's
economy.
   ``We talked of doing a studio tour when Walt was alive,'' said
Nunis. ``We've wanted to do this for a long, long time. It's a
dream come true.''
   Disney will get a year's jump on some formidable competition in
the high-stakes family entertainment business, in which the company
founded by the late cartoonist has emerged as one of the undisputed
leaders. Universal Studios Florida is building a rival $500 million
complex to be finished next May.
   Just a few miles away, Universal is billed as the nation's
largest working studio outside of Hollywood. Movie and TV
production already is under way at the 440-acre facility owned by
MCA Inc. and Rank Organization PLC of London.
   Universal will feature what it calls a ``total experience'' of
Hollywood-style filmmaking to the public, making the visitor a
participant in the action. It expects to attract up to 6 million
visitors a year.
   Despite their well-publicized rivalry, Disney and MCA officials
insist the competition is good for each other as well as Florida,
where family-oriented entertainment has become one of the dominant
industries.
   ``We've always had competition _ from Sea World, Busch Gardens,
Cape Canaveral, Boardwalk and Baseball and many others,'' Eisner
said. ``We welcome competition. It's good for Central Florida.
Disney does things in its own way, and we feel comfortable that we
will have our niche in the community.''
   The Disney-MGM theme park is the centerpiece of a $1
billion-plus renaissance of the 27,400-acre resort in the pine
woods and citrus groves of central Florida, once populated largely
by alligators and armadillos before it opened 18 years ago.
   Not that a rebirth is needed.
   ``We're having a phenomenal year in both (hotel) occupancy and
(theme park) attendance,'' said Disney World publicist Charlie
Ridgway.
   After achieving a record $3.4 billion in revenues and $522
million in profits in fiscal 1988, Disney has on tap a number of
``openings'' at its Florida resort this year besides the studios.
   On schedule to open this fall is part of what it calls the
largest convention-hotel complex in the Southeast. Making their
debut this summer will be Typhoon Lagoon (``the world's largest
water park'') and the Pleasure Island nighttime entertainment
district.
   Built for the teen-age crowd, Nunis says Typhoon Lagoon will
make all other water attractions as obsolete as Disneyland made
amusement parks in 1955.
   ``We're finally going to be able to make waves,'' says Nunis.
``Surfing, a 100-foot mountain, a saltwater snorkling reef,
including sharks and other live critters (in an enclosed area). I
can hardly wait to put on my bathing suit.''
   Pleasure Island is for those who still have energy left at the
end of an exhausting day at the Disney-MGM Studios park, Epcot
Center or the Magic Kingdom. The complex of restaurants, shops and
nightclubs is built on a six-acre island at the Disney Village.
   Opening this fall is the 770-room Swan Hotel, which along with
the larger Dolphin Hotel will form the lodging side of the
convention-hotel complex near Epcot Center. The 1,500-room Dolphin
is to open in July 1990.
   The more modestly priced Caribbean Beach Resort hotel opens an
additional 800 rooms this summer for a total of 2,112. The 907-room
Grand Floridian Beach Resort, a luxury Victorian-style hotel,
opened last summer.
   Also set for completion this fall will be a new Epcot pavilion,
the Wonders of Life, featuring a simulated ride through the human
bloodstream and a movie that takes a viewer from conception through
birth.
   All Disney's doings are coming together during a busy start for
Florida tourism this year. More than 3.4 million tourists visited
the state in January, an 18.6 percent increase over the first month
of 1988, the Florida Department of Commerce says.
   State tourism officials predict the number of visitors will
increase 6 percent this year. That means the state would host 38.7
million tourists, vs. 36.6 million in 1988.
   Disney's Ridgway attributes the improved season to a generally
strong U.S. economy and a larger number of foreign tourists.
   For local Floridians, Disney World's building spree is one of
the main economic engines providing jobs.
   One of Disney's most-popular spots is the employment office,
currently hiring 2,500 new workers at a minimum pay of $5 an hour
to help staff new attractions that will swell the Disney complex's
workforce to about 28,000, nearly twice the level of eight years
ago.
   The new attractions also have prompted a $1 increase in one-day
admission prices at the Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center and the
introduction of a new four-day passport good at any of the three
theme parks, effective Monday.
   The new ticket will cost $94 for adults and $77 for children 3
to 9 years old. It provides unlimited admission to the three parks
for four days. New single-day admission prices for any one park
will be $29 for adults and $23 for children.

   Unilever, the European consumer products
conglomerate, Friday said it dropped its plan to purchase the
Faberge and Elizabeth Arden lines of toiletries, cosmetics and
fragrances for $1.55 billion from Riklis Family Corp.
   Negotiations on a definitive pact broke down because the Riklis
group sought ``significant changes in the structure and terms of
the transaction which would have involved Unilever in substantial
additional costs,'' according to an announcement from Unilever
United States Inc., the U.S. arm of the British-Dutch household and
consumer products giant.
   The proposed all-cash acquisition from New York investor
Meshulam Riklis' Riklis Family Corp. had been approved in principle
on Feb. 10.
   Details of a formal agreement had been expected to be worked out
during talks that were to be concluded within 90 days.
   ``At the agreed price the acquisition of Faberge and Elizabeth
Arden would have been an important step forward in our strategy for
personal products,'' a Unilever spokesman said. ``They now appear
to be available only with a construction and price which do not
represent reasonable value to our shareholders.''
   Unilever spokesman David Lustig declined to disclose the Riklis
demands, saying he was prohibited from doing so by a
confidentiality agreement.
   The Riklis group also refused to comment.
   Under the February agreement, Unilever was to buy all of Faberge
Inc. except for the McGregor Apparel Group, which comprises
clothing lines such as Botany 500, Wonderknit and Billy the Kid.
   Among some of the name brands of Faberge and of its independent
subsidiary Elizabeth Arden that Unilever would have gotten were
Visible Difference, Chloe, Lagerfeld, Flawless Finish, Aqua Net and
Brut.
   It had been expected that as part of the acquisition Unilever
would gain the Faberge name and Faberge Inc. would switch its name
to McGregor. It had not been specified whether the Faberge and
Elizabeth Arden lines would be folded into Uniliver's U.S. division
or its British or Dutch companies called Unilever PLC and Unilever
NV, respectively.
   Faberge was bought by the Riklis group in 1984 for about $180
million. The holding company acquired Elizabeth Arden for $700
million at the end of 1987. Other Riklis holdings include Samsonite
luggage and Culligan water softeners.
   Through acquisitions and internal growth, Unilever for several
years has been building its personal products operations around the
world. It has targeted several segments of the market for further
expansion, among them the prestige end of the fragrance and beauty
aid business.
   Two years ago, Unilever bought Chesebrough-Pond's Inc. for $3.1
billion, thereby acquiring many widely known personal-care
products, including several prestige, or expensive, lines such as
the Prince Matchabelli fragrance collection. Unilever also owns
Elizabeth Taylor's Passion scents.
   Lustig said the prestige portion of the personal products
business appeals to Unilever because it has been growing strongly
and has not been fully exploited, particularly in the Far East and
other parts of the world.
   Prestige items account for an estimated $8 billion, or 20
percent, of the overall personal products market.

   Wheat futures prices closed sharply higher Friday
on the Chicago Board of Trade as speculation continued on what
position the Bush administration will take on whether to continue
subsidized grain sales to foreign countries.
   Corn futures were lower, oat futures rose and soybeans fell as
rains continued in Illinois and Iowa.
   Wheat prices climbed as word spread of a second U.S. economic
policy committee meeting in Washington on the issue of subsidized
grain sales.
   ``Everyone is waiting to hear a final decision,'' said Ted Mao,
an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York. ``Wheat is
more a political market than a drought market.''
   The Export Enhancement Program was begun several years ago as a
means of reducing U.S. grain stockpiles, but stocks were drained to
such low levels last year that some officials want to end the
program.

   Kellogg Co. said Friday its
first-quarter profit rose 31.7 percent, but would have fallen 8
percent if not for a one-time gain from an accounting change.
   The cereal company reported earning $111.4 million, or 91 cents
a share, during the first three months of this year, without the
effects of the accounting change, compared with first-quarter
earnings of $121.1 million, or 98 cents a share, during the same
time last year.
   The change in how the company accounted for its income taxes
boosted first-quarter 1989 earnings to $159.5 million, or $1.30 a
share.
   Sales during the first three months of this year rose 10.1
percent to $1.13 billion this year compared with $1.03 billion last
year.
   ``Market conditions were extremely competitive and investments
in developing new products and marketing our products around the
world were at record levels,'' Chairman William LaMothe said. ``We
remain optimistic that our business will continue to experience
strong growth, particularly in international markets.''
   LaMothe also said the board of directors had authorized
management to buy up to $100 million worth of Kellogg stock during
the next 12 months. It was the third straight year that the board
gave management authority to repurchase the stock.

<HEAD>State Regulators Say They May Go Easy on Drexel</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS last graf to INSERT dropped word `investigation'; No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Some state securities regulators say they are
ready to go easy on Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street
firm that has pledged to admit to felonies and pay millions in
fines to resolve federal civil an criminal fraud charges.
   ``They paid their pound of flesh, there are class action suits
out there. Why should I stab the dead?'' said John Baldwin, Utah's
securities director and president of the North American Association
of Securities Administrators.
   State securities officials met here Friday to discuss punitive
action against Drexel, which faces losing its state brokerage
licenses and fines for its role in the Wall Street insider trading
scandals.
   State laws generally bar convicted or admitted felons from
operating in the securities industry. Drexel has agreed to plead
guilty to six crimes and pay $650 million in penalties to resolve a
range of fraud charges brought by the Justice Department.
   But legal challenges in New York to the federal judge who must
approve the criminal pact and a separate settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission are delaying resolution of the
federal case indefinitely.
   Until Drexel formally enters a plea, the states are powerless to
punish Drexel.
   ``The states can't do anything until there is an order issued of
some sort,'' Susan Bryant, Oklahoma's securities administrator, who
heads a panel of state regulators examining Drexel, said Thursday.
   But, she added, ``It probably will mean states will start
negotiating a settlement with Drexel even though there is no order
yet.''
   Anticipating a wave of punitive action, lawyers for Drexel have
met with regulators in all 50 states.
   ``We're eager to come to a satisfactory resolution in this
matter,'' Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said Friday in New York.
``We understand (the states') concerns and interests.''
   Regulators said they are studying punitive measures against
Drexel, including administrative fines, suspensions and
supervision, and concessions that would permit the firm to continue
doing business, such as selling municipal bonds, with towns and
cities. State-by-state monetary settlements are another possibility.
   California, home to Drexel's high-yield junk bond division that
does hundreds of millions of dollars in business, has an
insider-trading statute and could bar Drexel employees and restrain
its business if it can trace back to the state part of the frauds
alleged by the federal government.
   Delaware, where Drexel is a registered broker but has no
offices, could strip the firm's license and levy fines _ $10,000
per violation, an amount dwarfed by the $650 million the firm has
agreed to pay the federal government.
   Losing its license may not matter to Drexel because it is
quitting the retail brokerage business, selling about half of its
43-office network to Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. The rest of
the department is still on the auction block.
   Anreder said the decision was not motivated by the possibility
of losing its broker-dealer license, but by declining business due
to bad publicity and a weak Wall Street business environment.
   ``We intend to retain our broker-dealer license in every state.
We do transactions with people and you just may as well be
registered. It makes it much easier,'' he said.
   While states don't have to prove any individual investors bought
stock in companies tied to the alleged frauds, it is widely
believed that citizens in all states were affected. As such, states
could file civil lawsuits against the firm seeking restitution.
   But regulators said they plan to let class-action suits cover
claims by investors who say they were defrauded by Drexel's
actions. About 12 such suits have been filed, in states including
California, New York and Pennsylvania.
   In taking action they also said they would consider the broad
nature of the SEC pact, which places Drexel under unprecedented
supervision for three years and forces it to overhaul its
management and compliance procedures.
   ``To the extent that they cleaned up their overall act, we have
to take that into account,'' said G.W. McDonald, assistant
enforcement commissioner in California's Department of Corrections.
   ``It's fair to say the states will rely on the investigations
that have taken place to date,'' he said.
   McDonald said he expects some regulators to follow the SEC's
lead; because the commission didn't strip Drexel's brokerage
license, they feel the states shouldn't either.
   Regulators also predict that Drexel bond financier Michael
Milken _ who is fighting sweeping fraud and racketeering charges _
may try to block release of internal company documents that state
officials may seek to obtain, further delaying investigation of
Drexel's activities.

   Colt Firearms, maker of the gun that won
the West, was put on the auction block Friday, but the company's
parent denied a three-year struggle with striking workers prompted
the decision.
   ``It's a going business and it's profitable, and, of course, it
has a history of quality products,'' said Michael G. Dunn, a
spokesman for Colt Firearms' parent, Colt Industries Inc.
   Dunn said senior officials at New York-based Colt Industries
decided to sell the firearms division so they could concentrate on
the company's aerospace, automotive and industrial service
operations.
   A continuing strike and the recent loss of a contract to produce
M-16 rifles for the military didn't prompt the action, he added.
   Dunn declined to say whether privately held Colt Industries had
received any bids or how much the company is asking for the unit.
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. has been hired to evaluate any offers.
   Analysts said proceeds from the sale could be used to help
retire debt incurred when Colt Industries' management mounted a
$660 million leveraged buyout a year ago.
   Maeda Klein, a vice president with Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette,
estimated Colt's outstanding debt at $1.8 billion.
   The 1,100 employees at Colt Firearms' two plants in Hartford and
West Hartford were informed of the decision Friday morning.
   ``I think it might be a good omen,'' said Robert Madore,
president of United Auto Workers Local 376. The union represented
about 1,000 blue-collar workers who walked off their jobs on Jan.
24, 1986, in a dispute over wages and benefits.
   ``I think maybe a new face, a new owner might turn it around,''
Madore said. He said the union could make an offer to buy the
company, but he cautioned that such a move hasn't yet been
discussed with the membership.
   Colt has managed to keep its plants operating by hiring
replacement workers and using about 200 strikers who crossed picket
lines.
   The dispute is now before the National Labor Relations Board,
where the union is seeking about $40 million in back wages and job
reinstatement.
   Klein said a change in management could help end the walkout.
``Maybe there's an easy way out if you bring in a new company
culture,'' she said.
   But State Rep. Joseph A. Adamo, D-West Haven, said the sale
could ``very well leave those (striking) workers in the lurch. It
could be devastating.''
   The Colt company was founded in Hartford in 1836 by Samuel Colt,
the inventor of the first successful repeating pistol. The pistol
had a cylinder of several chambers that could be discharged in
succession by the same locking and firing mechanism.
   It was after the entrepreneur's death in 1862 that his company
manufactered the six-shooter that every cowboy carried in his
holster and was said to have won the West.
   In addition to the M-16 rifle, the standard Army-issue rifle
still used today, Colt manufactures the Colt 45 handgun, the King
Cobra magnum revolver and the AR-15 rifle.
   Colt had produced the M-16 rifle for the Army since 1964. But in
October 1988, the Army announced that it was dropping Colt after it
was underbid for a contract to produce about one million rifles by
FN Manufacturing Inc. of Columbia, S.C. FN manufacturing is owned
by the Belgian firm, Fabrique Nationale S.A.
   Colt gained national attention in March when it voluntarily
decided to halt the sale of its semi-automatic rifles in response
to public outcry to the murder of California school-children by a
man using a similar assault weapon.

   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the index of

Interest rates fell in the credit markets on the news.

   Knight-Ridder Inc. shareholders adopted measures
Friday to fend off unwanted takeover bids and major stock
acquisitions by foreigners, the company said.
   Mergers and other major stock purchases would have to be
approved by holders of 80 percent of the media company's common
stock, not including shares owned by the prospective buyer.
   An exemption could be made if the company's board, acting on a
recommendation from a panel of independent journalism experts,
backed the transaction.
   An 80 percent vote also would be needed to approve any stock
purchase that would result in foreign ownership of more than 20
percent of the company.
   Actions by shareholders at the annual meeting weren't triggered
by any actual efforts to buy company stock, said Knight-Ridder
spokeswoman Lee Ann Schlatter.
   ``There have been no rumors and no activity whatsoever that
we're aware of,'' she said. ``This really just has to do with the
business climate that we exist in, in which business takeovers are
becoming a part of our way of life.''
   Shareholders also agreed to reserve an additional 3.5 million
shares of common stock for the company's employee stock-option plan.
   Knight-Ridder is an international communications company that
publishes 30 daily newspapers and six suburban weeklies.
   The company has contracts to sell its eight television stations,
the Pasadena, Calif., Star-News and four smaller papers in the
area. Negotiations also are under way to sell the Post-Tribune in
Gary, Ind.

<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp.'s board of directors Friday announced a
realignment that establishes Campeau as a holding company for its
real estate and retailing operations in the United States and
Canada.
   The restructuring of the Toronto-based corporation came as the
result of a process that has been in the works since Campeau
acquired Federated Department Stores Inc. in a $6.7 billion hostile
takeover last May.
   Robert Campeau will continue as chairman and chief executive.
Ronald W. Tysoe, formerly executive vice president and president of
Campeau (U.S.), will take over as president and chief operating
officer of the newly restructured company.
   Tysoe replaces James T. Roddy, whose resignation was disclosed
Thursday.
   Roddy, 45, and a veteran of the retail business, worked closely
on the takeover of Federated. There was no word on Roddy's plans
and an announcement Friday from Campeau said only that he was
leaving to pursue other career interests.
   Carolyn Buck Luce, a Campeau senior vice president who had been
involved with financial nuts and bolts of the Federated purchase,
also submitted her resignation.
   Retail industry analysts said the changes in the corporate
parent should have little direct bearing on Campeau's department
store businesses.
   Federated operates Abraham and Straus, Bloomingdale's, Burdines
and other chain stores. Also under Campeau's corporate umbrella is
Allied Stores Corp., which Campeau acquired in 1986 for $3.4
billion. Allied and Federated have headquarters in Cincinnati.
   Pamela Stubing, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service Inc.,
said the changes at Campeau could end up being beneficial for
Allied and Federated.
   ``I'm told that ... the people at the Allied-Federated level
will have more say in day-to-day operations and strategies going
forward,'' said Stubing. ``I think that's good. There's always a
danger when there are decisions being made one level removed.''
   She said Moody's doesn't intend to initiate a review of the
ratings it has assigned to Allied and Federated debt on account of
Campeau's restructuring. Moody's is a leading credit rating agency
and its opinions can influence the interest rates corporations are
charged to borrow money.
   ``I'm just waiting for the second half of the year to see how
that transpires,'' she said, noting that the second six months of
the calendar year is the most important time for retailers.
   Campeau said the reorganization ``reflects the evolution'' that
began in 1985 with ``our decision to grow beyond our Canadian real
estate roots and to acquire certain prime U.S. retail interests.''
   ``We have made tremendous progress in the last year in
accomplishing our strategies for asset acquisition and
restructuring, as well as debt reduction and corporate financing,''
the company stated.
   Under the restructuring, separate subsidiaries will report to
the Campeau holding company. These are: Federated and Allied, which
together form the department store group; Ralphs Grocery Co., the
California supermarket unit; Campeau Development Corp., the U.S.
real estate group; and Campeau Canada, the Canadian real estate
development concern.
   Two additional executive changes were announced.
   Paul Campbell, currently senior vice president for the Eastern
region of Campeau Corp., has been named president of the
restructured Campeau Canada, which comprises all of the company's
commercial real estate and shopping center interests in Canada.
   Russell S. Davis, executive vice president and chief financial
officer of Federated and Allied, will expand his responsibilities
and also become chief financial officer for the Campeau holding
company. He succeeds Roger Ashton who resigned to return to a
partnership position at a Toronto accounting firm.
   In a separate announcement, Campeau reported its financial
results for the year ended Jan. 31, 1989.
   Campeau said its net loss came to $34 million in the latest
period, an improvement from a loss of $196 million in the 13 months
ended Jan. 31, 1988.
   Revenue from continuing operations rose to $8.67 billion,
boosted by the acquisition of Federated and Ralphs, compared to
$3.53 billion in the 13-month period a year earlier.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Despite Intervention</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against all major
currencies except the Canadian dollar Friday despite central bank
intervention and further indications that the U.S. economy is
losing steam.
   Gold prices took a tumble. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid price for gold of $377.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m.
EDT, down from Thursday's late bid of $382.30.
   A Commerce Department report showing the government's chief
economic forecasting gauge slipped 0.7 percent in March failed to
halt the dollar's rise both at home and abroad.
   The drop in the index of leading indicators, which marked the
first back-to-back declines in more than a year, was interpreted as
another sign the economy is cooling, and analysts predicted the
slowdown will become more pronounced later this year.
   Dealers also noted that coordinated central bank intervention,
begun by the Swiss central bank and followed by the central banks
of the United States, Britain, West Germany, Italy and France,
failed to stem the dollar's rise.
   ``The dollar has been firm all day; it's just ignoring the
numbers,'' said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and
Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Even though the Federal Reserve appears unlikely to tighten
credit by hiking interest rates, Johnson said investors still feel
U.S. interest rates are attractive. Higher interest rates make
dollar-denominated securities more attractive.
   Jack Barbanel, a senior vice president at Gruntal &amp; Co., also
noted that foreign investors continue to view the U.S. economy as
relatively strong.
   ``Possibly they feel that even if we have a slowdown that leads
to a recession, they're much better off with dollars because if the
U.S. goes into a recession, we will really have a global
recession,'' he said.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 132.49 Japanese yen, up
from 132.05 late Thursday. Later in London, the dollar traded
higher at 133.00 yen. In New York the dollar rose to 133.05 yen,
from 132.12 yen on Thursday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6845 late Friday, cheaper
for buyers than Thursday's late $1.6905. In New York the pound cost
$1.6855, less expensive than $1.6910 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.8810 West German marks, up from
1.8760; 1.6755 Swiss francs, up from 1.6586; 6.3580 French francs,
up from 6.3475; 1,377.00 Italian lire, up from 1,374.25, and 1.1853
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1920.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late
rates, included: 1.8805 West German marks, up from 1.8756; 1.6742
Swiss francs, up from 1.6585; 6.3650 French francs, up from 6.3455;
2.1220 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1150; 1,377.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,373.50, and 1.1835 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1940.
   Gold prices slumped worldwide. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery fell to $377.90 a troy
ounce, from Wednesday's $383.30.
   The late bid gold price in London was $378.25 a troy ounce, down
from $384.25. The Zurich, late bid price was $377.75, down from
$384.25. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $381.85 bid, down
from $385.15.
   Silver bullion prices also slipped. On the New York Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.601 a troy ounce,
down from Thursday's close of $5.645. In London, silver traded at a
late bid price of $5.63 a troy ounce, down from $5.76.

   Bachelors David Pitassi and Wally Klemp don't
have babies. But they're covering the bottoms of infants with a
disposable diaper they say is cheaper and better than the
better-known competition.
   Move over Pampers, Luvs and Huggies, the diaper entrepreneurs
say. Here come Drypers.
   The four-size, patent-pending diaper has what their company
calls a ``double lock-away core'' that absorbs moisture and wicks
it from the baby's skin. The core is made of paper fluff and two
parallel bands of super-absorbent material that can soak up to 100
times its weight in liquid.
   Unlike the his-and-hers diapers that have a more absorbent
material in the front and bottom, the Dryper core runs down the
middle of the entire diaper, making it applicable for both girls
and boys, Klemp says.
   ``We think our product has better features,'' says Pitassi.
   He and Klemp and a third partner, Terry Tognietti, began
marketing Drypers last summer, and they debuted on Houston grocery
shelves in September.
   Sales are exceeding expectations, the company claims. It's
reporting monthly sales of about $1 million and has captured 12
percent to 20 percent of the market in cities where Drypers are
sold.
   Although that's more than Veragon hoped for, it remains well
below the dominance of Procter &amp; Gamble Co., maker of Pampers and
Luvs, and Kimberly-Clark Corp., maker of Huggies. So Veragon's
founders are happy but reserved.
   ``We don't want to grow faster than we can control,'' Klemp
says. Production at a new Houston plant already is running 24 hours
a day, seven days a week to fill orders for New Orleans and all of
Texas.
   The $3.3 billion national diaper business is not new to the
Veragon partners.
   Pitassi and Klemp, both 30, formed a diaper company, VMG
Products, in Vancouver, Wash., in 1984.
   ``I was working for Procter &amp; Gamble selling diapers and saw the
diaper business was growing. The country was going through a baby
boom. It just represented a tremendous opportunity,'' Pitassi
recalld.
   ``For us you had two big groups (Procter &amp; Gamble and
Kimberly-Clark) and here we had come along with the same quality,
if not better, diaper for a better price,'' he says.
   VMG, now the third-largest diaper maker, grossed millions months
after production began. Within a year, however, the two lost
control of the operation in a hostile takeover. They ventured out
on their own again.
   Tognietti, 31, learned the diaper business during nine years
with Procter &amp; Gamble _ which introduced disposable diapers in 1961
with Pampers _ and helped design P&amp;G's gender-specialized Luvs
diapers.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble is the nation's largest
producer of disposable diapers, claiming 47 percent of market.
Dallas-based Kimberly-Clark is No. 2 with about 30 percent.
   The top two are locked in a court battle. Procter &amp; Gamble is
suing its main competitor for patent infringement, accusing
Kimberly-Clark of copying the design of its highly successful
super-absorbent Pampers for use in super-absorbent Huggies.
   Pitassi says selling Drypers close to the factory saves the
company transportation costs and enables Veragon to charge an
average of $1 less per box of diapers than the competition.
   Veragon picked Houston as its manufacturing center over six
other Southwest cities, partly because of tax abatements and ardent
wooing by the Houston Economic Development Council.
   The heart of the company's 80,500-square-foot headquarters is a
$2 million diaper-assembly machine that combines 15 raw materials.
The machine, dubbed ``Drypers One'' churns out 350 diapers a minute.
   The company eventually may diversify and produce other paper
products, but for now, Drypers is the main focus.
   ``No question _ our baby is Drypers,'' Klemp says.

   Billionaire hotelier Jay Pritzker and other
suitors formally have submitted bids for strikebound Eastern
Airlines, but the carrier remained locked Friday on its planned
course of cutting operations and selling $1.8 billion in assets.
   Another potential buyer surfaced Friday, with the release of a
statement purportedly from a group of New York financial
institutions indicating they were prepared to pay $1 billion for
Eastern _ but only if the deal included assets sold by the airline
since its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air Corp.
   Pritzker, the chairman of Hyatt Corp., informally offered around
$500 million for Miami-based Eastern several weeks ago, according
to sources close to the situation.
   Jack Bavis, the head of Eastern's pilots union, told his
membership late Thursday that Pritzker submitted a bid Wednesday to
federal bankruptcy court, Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo, the airline's
unions and major creditors.
   Bavis also said Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl C. Icahn has
requested confidential financial data on Eastern as a prelude to
making an offer for the nation's seventh-largest carrier.
   The consortium of New York financial institutions, meanwhile,
said it had submitted an offer to the bankruptcy court and examiner
David Shapiro that would provide more than $1 billion for
``acquisition and startup costs for Eastern Airlines and additional
unspecified assets.''
   A brief statement issued by the consortium gave few details and
a person listed as spokesman in New York did not immediately return
a telephone call. Shapiro also did not immediately return a call
seeking confirmation of the proposal.
   The statement said the offer would give the unions a substantial
equity stake in Eastern with equivalent representation on the board
of directors. The consortium would provide more than $500 million
in working capital to fund the first six months of operation under
the plan, the statement said.
   The offer requires that no Eastern assets would be sold and
assets transferred to parent Texas Air and sister carrier
Continental Airlines starting in early 1986 would be returned.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has called a hearing for
next Wednesday to address the question of whether Eastern should be
auctioned in its entirety, including the pre-1986 assets.
   Edward Beauvais, the chairman of America West Airlines, said
Thursday his carrier still was interested in buying Eastern's
Northeast shuttle service if the planned $365 million sale to
developer Donald Trump falls through. Beauvais said the
Phoenix-based airline had lined up tentative outside financing and
is prepared to bid $600 million to $700 million for the shuttle and
a bevy of aircraft.
   An associate of Pritzker in his Chicago office said he was out
of the country and unavailable for comment. Details of his formal
bid weren't available.
   While confirming that the airline had received an offer from
Pritzker, Eastern spokesman Robin Matell insisted ``there are still
no bona fide offers to buy Eastern.''
   Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. ``is not having any discussions
with any potential buyers,'' Matell said in a telephone interview
from Miami. ``We're moving ahead with our rebuilding plan and are
making good progress in discussions with the creditors committee
and the court regarding our business plan to get Eastern back in
the air.''
   Eastern's managers recently detailed plans to operate at
one-third the airline's pre-strike size and raise $1.8 billion by
selling assets, including planes, airport gates and landing slots
at unspecified locations.
   As a first step, Eastern announced plans Thursday to lease 14
Boeing 727-200s to Pan American World Airways for $96.6 million
over five years.
   Eastern is expected to announce more deals for leasing and
selling aircraft in the coming days, according to sources close to
the company.
   All transactions and any sale of the entire airline must be
approved by federal bankruptcy court in New York, where Eastern
filed for Chapter 11 reorganization and protection from creditors
on March 9.
   Eastern's Machinists union struck the carrier on March 4 after a
long wage dispute and were joined by pilots and flight attendants,
virtually grounding the airline and draining its cash reserves.
   Pritzker's representatives presented an informal proposal to the
creditors committee on April 14 that called for Pritzker to buy
Eastern's fleet of around 250 planes for an unspecified cash
payment and lease them back to Eastern, said sources close to the
situation.
   In addition, Pritzker would pay Eastern around $100 million
cash, receive all Eastern's stock except for an unspecified share
to be owned by its unions, and would forgive $185 million in debt
Eastern is owed by Texas Air, the sources said.
   Lorenzo's agreement with ex-baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth to sell Eastern for $464 million fell through April 12.

<HEAD>Mobil Pulls Out Of South Africa After 90 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Corp., long a proponent of doing business
in South Africa, said Friday it was leaving the racially-divided
nation after 90 years of business there and will take a net loss of
$140 million on the move.
   The withdrawal of Mobil, the largest American company doing
business in South Africa, leaves 135 other American companies still
operating there, according to the Washington-based Investor
Responsibility Research Center, a not-for-profit association funded
by institutional investors.
   The oil giant said it was selling operations once valued at more
than $400 million to General Mining Union Corp. Ltd. for more than
$155 million in cash plus $10 million that was expected to be the
operation's 1989 profit.
   After adjustments for taxes and accounting, the company will
record a net book loss of $140 million on the sale.
   ``The rand has fallen a great deal over the last few years and
that has reduced the dollar value of the company in South Africa,''
said Mobil spokesman John Lord. The loss will be included in the
company's second-quarter earnings report, Lord said.
   In a prepared statement earlier in the day, New York-based Mobil
had said the price exceeded Mobil's estimated present value of the
South African operation's future earnings.
   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray blamed U.S. foreign policies,
including a 1987 law that eliminated certain tax credits for U.S.
companies doing business in South Africa, ultimately forcing the
pullout.
   ``The law was ill conceived ... and had a serious economic
impact on us,'' Murray said.
   The sale, expected to be concluded by June 30, includes a
refinery and retail and commercial petroleum marketing networks.
Twelve Mobil affiliates are involved in the sale, doing business in
South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho, Mobil said.
   Mobil stock closed at $50.75 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange, down 50 cents from Thursday's close.
   ``This was a difficult decision because we continue to believe
that our presence and our actions have contributed greatly to
economic and social progress for non-whites in South Africa,''
Murray said.
   ``But we had to weigh business considerations including the
impact of recently enacted and proposed U.S. legislation and
regulations which have made it more and more difficult for us to be
fully competitive there.''
   Congress in late 1987 passed a bill by Rep. Charles B. Rangel,
D-New York, eliminating a tax credit that allowed U.S. companies to
deduct taxes paid to South Africa against taxes owed to the U.S.
government.
   Murray said that as a result of the change, earnings in South
Africa were taxed twice and the effective tax rate on South African
earnings by U.S. corporations was 72 percent.
   Mobil's 1988 profit was $2.1 billion on revenue of $54.9
billion. Its foreign petroleum earnings totaled $1.2 billion, up 5
percent from 1987.
   Mobil had insisted since 1986 when Exxon Corp., the biggest U.S.
oil company, left South Africa that it would not bow to pressure to
disinvest. In the last four years more than 170 American firms have
withdrawn from that country because of South Africa's race
policies. Most sold their operations at what were considered low
prices to South African-controlled business.
   Two resolutions were to be presented by church groups at Mobil's
annual shareholders meeting in May asking the company to divest its
holdings in South Africa.
   Mobil employed almost 2,800 people in South Africa and had been
a symbol of foreign business reluctance to leave the country,
despite widespread condemnation of the white-led government's
suppression of the black majority in the system known as apartheid.
   Nevertheless, Mobil has received a No. 1 rating in the last two
years by a group that monitors U.S. companies' adherence to the
so-called Sullivan Principles, a set of voluntary
anti-discrimination guidelines for companies doing business in
South Africa.
   Mobil's agreement with Gencor continues Mobil's equal
opportunity policies and fund the Mobil Foundation at $3 million a
year at least until 1994. The foundation provides education,
housing and other assistance, mostly to black South Africans.
   The sale leaves Mobil, which does not export crude or products
to South Africa, without any holdings in South Africa, including
licensing or franchise operations, Murray said.
   Anti-apartheid groups cheered the move.
   ``Mobil succumbed to anti-apartheid pressure,'' said Diane
Bratcher of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsiblity, an
association of religious institutional investors that has targeted
Mobil since the 1970s.
   ``Whether they'll say that or not ... that's why they are
selling their assets.''
   Mobil and other companies have maintained they are doing more
good by staying in South Africa, but anti-apartheid groups claim
the companies indirectly support racist policies.
   ``So even though they are doing good in other areas they are
paying high taxes that are used to sustain apartheid,'' Bratcher
said.

   Bond prices fell Friday despite economic
statistics indicating that the economy is cooling and interest
rates may ease.
   The credit market's bellwether 30-year Treasury issue was down [
point, or $1.25 for every $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which
moves inversely to price, rose to 8.92 percent from 8.90 percent
late Thursday.
   The Commerce Department said its chief economic forecasting
gauge plunged 0.7 percent in March, the second straight decline and
the biggest drop in eight months.
   It was the first time the Index of Leading Economic Indicators,
which dropped 0.3 percent in February, posted back-to-back declines
since it fell for five straight months from September 1987 through
January 1988.
   Analysts said the 30-year bond gained slightly after the
economic data was announced, but the gains dwindled throughout the
day.
   ``After the run we've had this week, I think investors were
saying perhaps it's time to take a breather,'' said Harold Nathan,
a portfolio manager with Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in San Francisco.
   ``I think we will need some further signs of moderating
inflation and economic growth before we get any further significant
rally,'' he said.
   Bond traders used the opportunity to take profits following a
runup in the previous session, analysts said. The 30-year bond rose
{ point Thursday.
   Analysts said the latest negative signals are in line with signs
that the U.S. economy is losing steam. The prospects of slower
growth ``is appeasing the market for now,'' said Mitchell Held,
chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term securities were down from 1-16 point to 5-32 point,
intermediate governments fell 3-32 point to 7-32 point and
long-term maturities slumped from [ point to 3-16 point, according
to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.06 to 1,132.74.
   Corporate issues advanced. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate
Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.41
to 304.49.
   The Bond Buyer index was unavailable.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills leaped to 8.78 percent as
the discount rose 13 basis points to 8.49 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 9.05 percent as the discount rose 9 basis
points to 8.55 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.19
percent as the discount gained 10 basis points to 8.51 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 913-16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

   IGA Inc., the country's fourth-largest retail
food operation, says it will move into the Japanese market by
offering chain-style services to independent grocers there.
   The Chicago-based cooperative, which includes about 3,000
independent U.S. grocers and six of the seven largest U.S.
wholesale food distributors, expects to have 1,000 stores in Japan
within the next five years, said Chairman Thomas S. Haggai.
   IGA, which stands for Independent Grocers Alliance, is the first
U.S. supermarket retailer to enter the Japanese market, Haggai said
Thursday.
   IGA said small, independent grocers in Japan have been losing
their market share to newly emerging supermarket chains.
   IGA and its Japanese partner, C. Itoh Food Systems, a division
of C. Itoh &amp; Co. Ltd., will offer marketing, training and
operations services to independent grocers in return for a
percentage of their sales.
   But even more significant to IGA is the opportunity to sell IGA
brand merchandise, which includes more than 2,500 products, on
Japanese store shelves.
   ``If IGA products become 10 percent of a (Japanese) store's
sales, that could mean as much as $100 million a year to us,'' said
Karl Sheffield, a food-industry consultant with Chandler, Leigh &amp;
Co. who is advising IGA on the Japanese venture.

<HEAD>Is There A Stroh-Heileman Beer In The Future?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   G. Heileman Brewing Co. officials have
discussed buying a minority interest in the Stroh Brewery Co.,
touching off speculation about a possible merger between two of the
nation's largest beer companies.
   But analysts question whether such a deal could clear federal
antitrust laws.
   Stroh officials several weeks ago announced their willingness to
sell a minority interest in the Detroit-based company, the
third-largest brewer in the United States.
   The speculation about a merger was touched off when Murray
Cutbush, president and chief executive officer of La Crosse-based
Heileman, disclosed Thursday that representatives from his company
were in Detroit to meet with Stroh officials.
   Heileman, which was bought by Australia's Bond Corp. in 1987, is
the nation's No. 5 brewer, with a 1988 estimate of 15.4 million
barrels.
   Lacey Logan, a Stroh spokeswoman, said Friday that Stroh ``is in
the process of finding an international minority investment partner
or partners'' for ``opportunities available to Stroh outside of the
United States.''
   She said that Stroh ``has been having ongoing meetings with a
number of international brewers.''
   Stroh shipped an estimated 20.6 million barrels in 1988, far
behind the 40.5 million shipped by the Miller Brewing Co., which is
the country's second largest brewer.
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. was No. 1 with a 1988 estimate of 78.5
million barrels.
   Industry analysts have predicted competitors of Anheuser and
Miller might need to consolidate in order to challenge the
companies on a national level.
   ``Stroh and Heileman would be a sensible merger,'' said Robert
Weinberg, an industry analyst and professor of marketing management
at Washington University in St. Louis.
   ``Heileman has a lot of volume, but not good infrastructure,''
he said. ``Stroh has good infrastructure, but they don't have a lot
of volume.''
   ``You're looking at creating a brewer the approximate size of
Miller,'' he said.
   One major obstacle, however, could be antitrust laws, which
blocked earlier attempts by Heileman to buy both the Jos. Schlitz
Brewing Co. and Pabst Brewing Co. Schlitz was later bought by Stroh.
   ``If I were a smaller company, I would be squealing like a
pig,'' Weinberg said.
   If such a merger were proposed, he said, a critical issue would
be whether the combination of Stroh and Heileman would increase
competition within the industry or reduce it.
   In his remarks Thursday to the Wisconsin Wholesale Beer
Distributors Association, Cutbush predicted that a third major
player would emerge in the U.S. brewing industry within five years,
and he said Heileman intended to be that player.
   ``It's a long way between the beginning of negotiations and the
completion of negotiations,'' said Jerry Steinman, publisher of the
industry newletter, Beer Marketer's Insights. ``And a lot of
negotiations never bear fruit.''

<HEAD>Precious Metals Prices Drop On Signs Of Slowing Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals prices dropped sharply Friday as evidence of a
slowing U.S. economy continued to mount.
   The decline was led by gold, which tumbled on New York's
Commodity Exchange to a new low for the May contract.
   On other markets, wheat prices rose while corn and soybean
prices fell; cattle prices rallied but hog prices retreated; and
energy prices were mixed.
   Gold settled $5.40 to $6.20 lower with the contract for delivery
in May at $377.90 a troy ounce; silver was 4.4 cents to 7 cents
lower with May at $5.601 a troy ounce; platinum settled at $21.70
to $17.70 lower with July at $534.50 a troy ounce .
   The sell-off was largely a response to the Commerce Department's
report Friday that the index of leading economic indicators plunged
0.7 percent in March. It was the second consecutive decline in the
index and the sharpest in eight months.
   Precious metals, especially gold, are traditionally seen as safe
investments during periods of rising inflation. An economic
slowdown would likely result in less inflation.
   Platinum prices had risen sharply earlier in the week and
although supply factors are bullish, ``there is a lot of
uncertainty in the amount of demand,'' said George Anagnos of
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Analysts attributed the drop in silver prices to the Commodity
Exchange's report of a relatively large amount of the metal _ 200
million ounces _ in exchange-approved warehouses. The stockpile
equals about 20 months of demand, Anagnos said.
   Wheat closed sharply higher on the Chicago Board of Trade as
speculation continued on what position the Bush administration will
take on whether to continue subsidized grain sales to foreign
countries.
   Corn futures were lower, oat futures rose and soybeans fell as
rains continued in Illinois and Iowa.
   Soybeans also were pressured by word that the Brazilian dock
strike was breaking up after dockworkers gave their tentative
approval to a court-ordered pay raise.
   Corn for May delivery was boosted by rumors of a major sale to
the Soviet Union. After the close, the Agriculture Department
announced the sale of 1.05 million metric tons of corn to the
Soviets.
   Wheat settled 5{ cents to 12{ cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in May at $4.17{ cents a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
lower to { cent higher with May at $2.69\ a bushel; oats were }
cent to 3 cents higher with May at $1.78 a bushel; soybeans were 3
cents to 7 cents lower with May at $7.22{ a bushel.
   Cattle prices were up while hogs and pork bellies fell on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures tried to go lower early in the session, but
rallied late, an indication that cattle prices may have found a
long-awaited bottom, said Dale Durchholz, an analyst with
Agri-Visor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   Hog prices were pushed lower by commercial selling and ideas
that wholesale pork-product prices would decrease next week.
   Cattle settled .35 cent lower to .63 higher with June at 71.45
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .70 cent higher with
May at 76.52 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent to .45 cent lower
with June at 46.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .47 cent
to 1 cent lower with May at 31.37 cents a pound.
   Petroleum futures settled mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as traders sold before the expiration of gasoline and
heating-oil contracts.
   Crude prices were weak in anticipation of the restart of
production at the Brent oil field in the North Sea. Production was
cut by a platform accident last week.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 49 cents lower to 57
cents higher with June at $20.43 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent
lower to .50 cent higher with May at 51.70 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .13 cent to 3.91 cents lower with May at 74.21 cents a
gallon.

   Hewlett-Packard Co. will expand

   Under the agreement, a new company will be formed by combining

market in the world and Hewlett-Packard, a manufacturer of
computers and scientific equipment, has been active in the country
since 1967.
   ``This consolidation will create the only computer company in
Brazil capable of offering customers a full range of computing
solutions, from calculators to super-minicomputers,'' said Manuel
F. Diaz, general manager of Hewlett-Packard's Latin America region,
which includes Brazil.
   Under the partnership with Companhia Iochpe de Participacoes of
Brazil, a new company called Edisa Informatica SA, will be
established.
   The three existing companies are Edisa-Electronica Digital, a
subsidiary of Iochpe; Tesis Informatica, an Iochpe company that
sells Hewlett-Packard computer products; and Hewlett-Packard Do
Brasil SA, a company jointly owned by Iochpe and Hewlett-Packard.
   Brazilian nationals will be shareholders of the new company and
Iochpe will be the controlling shareholder. Hewlett-Packard will
provide technology and support to the new company, which will have
its headquarters in Alphaville, Sao Paulo. It will have offices in
11 major Brazilian cities, and manufacturing facilities will be
established in three cities, officials said.
   Flavio Sehn, 55, has been named president of the new firm. Sehn
has been president of Edisa-Electronica Digital for four years.
   Iochpe has operations in agriculture, paper manufacturing,
machinery, electronics, data processing, banking and insurance.

   Petroleum futures finished mixed Friday, with
gasoline falling for the second straight day after the recent steep
rise in prices.
   The May gasoline contract declined sharply as it expired Friday
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract closed 3.91 cents
lower than Thursday's session at 74.21 a gallon. Other contract
months lost between 1.05 and 0.13 cents.
   Crude oil finished mostly higher on the exchange, but the June
contract fell 50 cents to end the day at $20.42 a barrel. The July
contract remained flat at $19.34 a barrel.
   Heating oil was mixed with the May contract gaining 0.34 cent on
the expiration of the contract to finish at 52.20 cents a gallon.
   Gasoline has been the focus of market attention recently because
of expectations of tight supplies for the summer driving season,
largely because of new higher octane regulations scheduled to take
effect soon.
   But worries of even tighter supplies following the spill off the
Alaskan coast last month and a North Sea explosion recently have
sent prices zooming, at the wholesale and retail levels.
   Analysts have said, however, that although there might be a
tightness in the gasoline market this summer, a supply shortage is
unlikely.

<HEAD>Milken Vows To Reopen Shipyard Despite Indictment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKLAND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Junk bond financier Michael R. Milken,
who is fighting federal racketeering and fraud charges, has vowed
to join another battle: raising money to revive a dying
Massachusetts shipyard.
   Milken, who was charged last month in a 98-count indictment
capping an extensive government investigation, made a surprise
appearance Thursday before 700 former shipyard workers at the Sons
of Italy hall here.
   Milken told the group that he and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
the investment firm that has agreed to dismiss him, could easily
secure the millions of dollars in capital and bonds needed to
finance an employee-owned shipbuilding and repair operation at
Quincy's Fore River shipyard.
   ``By June 30, the money will be lined up for the yard,'' he said.
   Milken said he would help with the shipbuilding venture, but his
role in the venture was unclear.
   Drexel officials said Milken was instrumental in putting
together the firm's commitment.
   The firm has since agreed to disassociate itself from Milken
under an April 13 landmark civil fraud agreement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission settling charges including
insider trading. Milken also is barred from any business dealings
with Drexel employees.
   The pact, signed April 13, is pending approval by a federal
judge but Drexel already has placed Milken on leave of absence.
   Drexel vice president Pat Flanagan said Milken would have no
official involvement in the Quincy deal in the future.
   But Milken was introduced to the ex-shipyard workers as the man
who would make the deal work. Milken said that while Drexel would
manage the deal, he would make sure the project went through.
   It was unclear whether Milken's appearance and comments would be
considered a violation of the SEC agreement. A Drexel spokesman had
left the office late Friday and could not be reached for comment.

<TEXT>
   The Midwest Stock Exchange, in an attempt to
capture a share of the after-hours trading of U.S. stocks, is
proposing a second computerized trading session, officials said
Thursday.
   The new trading session, from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. CDT, would be
for the trading of portfolios and not for individual customers,
said vice president Roger Hendrick.
   The Midwest exchange is currently open from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.
CDT. Most of the stocks traded on the exchange are also traded on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   The exchange applied Wednesday to the Securities and Exchange
Commission for approval.
   Hendrick estimated that stock portfolios traded after hours
equal 10 million to 20 million shares daily. But the activity is
not reflected in reported trading volume and the volume is
difficult to accurately measure.
   Hendrick said the portfolios traded in the late afternoon will
be required to consist of at least 20 stocks, none of which may be
greater than 10 percent of the value of the portfolio.
   Brokerage firms trading portfolios will send their transactions
electronically into a computer at the Midwest exchange, which will
record the trade.
   Currently, such trades are registered on the London Stock
Exchange to comply with New York Stock Exchange rules that member
brokerages trade on recognized exchanges when it is closed.
   Hendrick said the Midwest exchange will charge a fee to record
the portfolio trades, which are recorded free of charge in London.

<HEAD>Office Furniture Wars Heat Up As Steelcase Files Suit Against Haworth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three months after a federal appeals
court ruled that Steelcase Inc. violated patents held by Haworth
Inc., the office furniture giant has turned the tables.
   Steelcase filed a lawsuit Wednesday in federal court contending
the smaller Holland-based company has infringed on two Steelcase
patents, one granted in 1980 and the second in 1984.
   Both are for panel electrical wiring systems, according to the
lawsuit.
   Steelcase insists the lawsuit is neither related to nor in
retaliation for an earlier one filed by Haworth now before the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   While both lawsuits involve the electrical system in the two
companies' panel systems, Steelcase spokesman Peter Jeff said:
``They're different patents and different issues. ... It's the same
church, but it's a different pew.''
   Haworth, the nation's third-largest office furniture maker, sued
Steelcase in 1985, claiming the industry leader was infringing on
Haworth patents when it designed, made and sold certain pre-wired
office panels.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Enslen last year ruled in favor of
Steelcase, but a federal appeals court reversed that opinion in
January, ruling for Haworth. Steelcase appealed to the nation's
highest court.
   Steelcase could end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars to
Haworth if the ruling stands.
   Haworth spokesman Richard Planck said Thursday the company would
have no comment until it receives formal notification of the
lawsuit.

<HEAD>MAI Basic Earnings Drop 61.8 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUSTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MAI Basic Four Inc., which designs and
makes business computers, said Friday that earnings dropped nearly
62 percent in the first three months of 1989 due in part to efforts
to acquire Prime Computer.
   Other factors contributing to the decline were a slowdown in the
mid-range computer industry and a softened dollar overseas, the
company said.
   Earnings for the second quarter ended March 31 declined to $2.4
million, or 16 cents per share, from $6.3 million, or 42 cents per
share, for the same quarter last year.
   ``Although our period earnings declined compared to last year,
through prudent expense controls we were able to achieve an
operating income margin of 12.8 percent for the six months ended
March 31, 1989, an excellent result in the context of the current
industry-wide slowdown,'' said William B. Patton Jr., president and
chief executive officer.
   Revenue for the quarter declined from $105.4 million in 1988 to
$104.7 million this year, the company said.
   The company said Prime Computer's resistance to a MAI tender
offer made last year contributed to the earnings decline. It noted
that the Delaware Chancery Court has set a May 24 hearing on
company motions to invalidate Prime's takeover defense.
   ``MBF remains committed to acquiring Prime at the earliest
possible time,'' said company Chairman Bennett S. LeBow.
   Orders for company products declined 5 percent in the first six
months of the company's fiscal year, compared to the same period a
year ago, primarily because of lower European sales, Patton said.
   MAI Basic Four designs, manufacturers and markets mid-range
business computers and information processing systems for
multi-user applications worldwide. The company, which has 4,200
employees, markets products in 39 countries.
