<HEAD>Searchers Find Missing Man Who Bolted From Chopper Taking Him To
Dad</HEAD>

   Searchers found a missing man in the desert
Monday hours after he bolted in a fit from a helicopter taking him
to his elderly father, who'd been lost in remote foothills for four
days, officials said.
   Joel Behrends had been riding a KPNX-TV helicopter Sunday night
to a reunion with his father, who had been missing since Thursday,
when he became agitated and insisted on being let out of the
aircraft, officials said.
   ``He looked really uncomfortable. He looked like he was going to
have a claustrophobic fit,'' said reporter Marlene Galan, who was
aboard the aircraft. ``There wasn't any talking to him. He wasn't
going to reason with anyone. I was afraid he was going to become
violent.''
   ``The skids touched down, his seat belt came off, and he flew
out the door,'' said KPNX-TV acting news director Al Macias. ``He
was seen taking off his shirt and running in the desert and was
yelling incoherently.''
   The pilot took off and tried to spot Behrends, but was
unsuccessful.
   Three helicopters, 30 searchers and eight tracking dogs,
including six which tracked the elder Behrends, took part in the
search for his son, Murphy said.
   Behrends, 31, lit a signal fire, which was spotted around 9:30
a.m., said Yavapai County sheriff's Capt. Bill Murphy.
   About 1{ hours later, an Army National Guard helicopter
airlifted Behrends out of the Cellar Basin area about 70 miles
north of Phoenix, Murphy said.
   ``The young man indicated to one of our officers that he had
been helping to trying to find his dad for three to four days, had
been out in the sun and was all stressed-up, and I guess when he
got in that helicopter he just couldn't take it,'' Murphy said.
   Behrends' 76-year-old father, William Behrends of Lamberton,
Minn., was rescued Sunday.
   The search for the father was much larger, covering 17,500
square miles in Yavapai, Pinal, Maricopa and Gila counties,
authorities said.
   Gem hunter Bob Woods of Phoenix found the elder Behrends
sleeping in his pickup truck Sunday near Wagoner, about 50 miles
northwest of Phoenix, officials said.
   William Behrends, who was visiting relatives in Phoenix, left
the city Thursday after telling his wife he was going to photograph
desert wildflowers. His truck got stuck in the sand after he made a
wrong turn, Murphy said.
   On Friday, he walked nine miles to an isolated ranch, but was
afraid to enter because of dogs in the yard and a no-trespassing
sign, officials said. Behrends turned around and walked the nine
miles back to his truck.
   The next day, Behrends walked to the ranch again, but no one was
home. He drank from a stream and walked back to the truck.
   William Behrends, who was tired and dehydrated when found, was
in fair condition Monday at Yavapai Regional Medical Center in
Prescott.

<TEXT>
   More tourists than ever are flooding Paris,
storming museums, mobbing hotels and crowding cafes to kick off
celebrations marking the French Revolution bicentennial.
   Even though events are just beginning, the Paris Tourism Office
says the capital already has 20 percent more visitors than at this
time in 1988.
   And nationwide, officials expect to break last year's record of
38 million visitors.
   ``There are going to be a lot of people in France,'' said Xavier
Beguin Billecocq, a tourism official with the Maison de la France.
``This year we expect an increase of about 15 percent.''
   Large-scale bicentennial events will begin in May, but plenty of
visitors are already in town.
   Nathalie Paul, a spokeswoman at the Paris Tourism Office, said
hotel rooms were filling up fast.
   ``We couldn't get into the Louvre yesterday. The line was
incredible,'' said Judith Goldberg of New York City. She waited in
line with hundreds of others outside the Musee d'Orsay, the Paris
showcase for 19th century art.
   As many as 50,000 tourists and Parisians have crowded the Louvre
daily since the museum's new pyramid entrance opened on March 29.
The Louvre renovations were scheduled to be completed in time for
bicentennial celebrations.
   But besides visiting the Louvre _ a museum since the early years
of the revolution _ and a few small exhibitions, tourists have few
bicentennial events to attend until next month.
   On May 4, the procession that opened the Estates General will be
recreated in Versailles. Two hundred years ago, the First, Second
and Third Estates _ representatives of the nobility, clergy and
commoners _ met to express the grievances that set the revolution
in motion.
   From May 5 to Nov. 11, Paris tourists can visit a mini-theme
park being set up in the elegant Tuileries Gardens, between the
Louvre and the Place de la Concorde.
   Organizers expect at least 3.5 million people to pay the
equivalent of three dollars to visit the park, which includes two
small cinemas, an exhibition hall, a theater, souvenir stands, two
cafes and six bars.
   Two 118-foot ``Towers of Liberty'' will mark the recreation area
and 32 actors in period costume will perform or wander among the
tourists portraying revolutionary figures.
   The Maison de la France has counted 6,000 bicentennial events
nationwide, from dances and fireworks to arcane academic seminars,
and published a list of 200 considered likely to interest tourists.
   The Eiffel Tower, built for the revolution's centennial
celebrations, marks its own 100th birthday this year, with special
festivities on June 17-18.
   A special U.S. homage to the revolution is scheduled July 8,
with bands from each of the 50 states parading through Paris. That
evening, the American Waterways Wind Orchestra will play from a
barge in the Seine River to a crowd before City Hall.
   The lucky few, including President Bush, will attend the July 13
opening night of the new Bastille Opera. The theater is being built
near where the Bastille was seized on July 14, 1789, the most
memorable event of the confused and turbulent revolutionary years.
   Musicians will play until dawn in what is being described as the
world's biggest ball.
   Bush, President Francois Mitterrand and the leaders of Britain,
West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada will hold the annual
seven-nation economic summit in Paris from July 14-16. Meetings
will be interspersed with bicentennial parades, fireworks and the
like.
   While Paris hosts the largest number of revolutionary
commemorations, the provinces are not left out. Among the
highlights will be an assembly of Tall Ships from July 9-16 in
Rouen and a gathering of 987 hot-air balloons near the small
village of Gouin in eastern France from July 26 to Aug. 6.

   In a cost-cutting move, Defense Minister Valerio
Zanone has decided to cancel the annual military parade on Italy's
Constitution Day.
   Zanone said he believed a ceremony at the recently reopened
Altar of the Nation, which is also known as the Victor Emmanuel
Monument, would be a more appropriate way to mark the June 4
holiday.
   He said Saturday that the decision was prompted by the need to
cut spending in anticipation of cuts in the defense budget. The
government is trying to cut spending to deal with a projected 1989
budget deficit of $89.6 billion.
   Instead of a military parade, this year's holiday will be marked
by wreath placing ceremony at the Altar of the Nation by President
Francesco Cossiga, historical and military exhibits and band
concerts.

<DATELINE>DEADWOOD, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Black Hills gold rush town
where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in an 1876 poker game are
betting a little gambling will restore the local economy by
reviving the spirit of the Old West.
   Voters decide Tuesday whether to allow poker, blackjack and slot
machines in their community of 2,000, known a century ago as the
wildest, wickedest town on the Western frontier.
   At the 85-year-old Franklin Hotel on Main Street, owner Bill
Walsh talked about how Deadwood might secure its future by
promoting its past, particularly the story of Wild Bill, whose
bronzed bust guards the hotel lobby.
   The U.S. marshal and frontiersman was shot in the back of the
head during a poker game at a saloon called No. 10 on Aug. 2, 1876.
Legend has it he was clutching a pair each of aces and eights,
ever-after known by card players as the ``dead man's hand.''
   ``I think that Deadwood's identity, as far as a tourism type of
destination area, has always been tied to Wild Bill Hickok and that
shooting,'' Walsh said. ``When people come to Deadwood, they expect
the Old West.''
   A bit of a betting boom might stop the town's decade-long
economic decline by creating jobs to draw young people back,
supporting services for the elderly and helping to make Deadwood a
center for the arts, he said. Mayor Tom Blair estimated gaming
might generate $500,000 a year for historic restoration.
   ``We want to give that impression of an old Western mining town
in 1889,'' Walsh said. ``While we're trying to go forward
economically, we're going to the past to give us that boost.''
   But some Deadwood residents oppose the gambling plan, which they
doubt will provide much of an economic boost.
   ``There is opposition here in town, and it's asically on moral
grounds,'' said the Rev. Don Hadrick of the United Methodist
Church, adding that opponents have been too intimidated by the
overwhelming support to make much noise. ``It's not popular to be
in the minority on issues such as this.''
   Blair predicted the gambling, limited to $5 bets and 15 games
for each establishment, would attract at least another 200,000
tourists to Deadwood each year, mostly vacationing families
interested in Black Hills recreation.
   ``If you want the glitz and glitter of Atlantic City or the
glamorous entertainmemt of Las Vegas, you've come to the wrong
place,'' Blair said. ``We want the gambling to augment what we are
year 'round: a beautiful part of South Dakota with lots of things
for people to do both summer and winter.''
   Until last year, South Dakota's Constitution forbade all games
of chance except the state lottery and games for charitable,
religious, educational or public-spirited purposes.
   The Deadwood You Bet Committee, made up mostly of local
officials and business owners, has been trying since 1985 to start
limited gambling. The effort paid off in November, when voters
statewide approved a constitutional amendment allowing the
Legislature to authorize limited gambling in Deadwood.
   Lawmakers gave the go-ahead a month ago, but gambling can only
begin if 60 percent of Deadwood voters approve it Tuesday. About 70
percent favored the constitutional amendment in November, and a
recent telephone survey of 900 of Deadwood's 1,200 registered
voters confirmed widespread support, Blair said.
   Deadwood was founded on a desire for wealth and adventure: an
1876 gold strike in Deadwood Gulch brought 7,000 people to the area
in seven months. As Deadwood grew, so did its reputation as the
rowdiest mining town of them all.
   ``Sodom and Gomorrah were both dull, stupid towns compared with
Deadwood,'' author J.W. Buel wrote in an 1886 book called ``Heroes
of the Plains.'' ``In a square contest for the honors of moral
depravity, the Black Hills' capital could give the people of the
Dead Sea cities three points in the game and then skunk them both.''
   Town leaders hope the limited gambling will recall the town's
past without any of the lawlessness. If gambling is approved, the
next 20 years will see the restoration of Deadwood's buildings and
other facilities, the mayor said.
   ``I would hope that as you step back onto Main Street ... that
you really see you're stepping back 100 years in time.''

   The best-kept secret at the top-secret
Savannah River nuclear weapons site is the expanse of wilderness
that is home to two endangered species along with alligators, fish
and other wildlife.
   The government-owned nature preserve coexists with the giant
reactors that, when operating, produce key components for the
nation's nuclear weapons.
   Alligators glide through mist-shrouded swamp waters. Red-breast
sunfish ply the blackwater streams. Yellow rat snakes slither up
long-needle pine trees.
   The tranquility of nature barely a stone's throw from the
reactors seems out of synch with the nature of the work that goes
on at the Savannah River site.
   ``A lot of people think it must be desolate, but it's not. In
some ways it's thriving,'' said Frances Close Hart, head of the
Columbia, S.C.-based Energy Research Foundation, a strong critic of
the plant's nuclear production activities.
   Public attention to the Savannah River site, situated just south
of this small city, has focused on the safety of the three
reactors. The concrete structures, each casting identical profiles
against the wooded backdrop, are the nation's only source of
tritium, which is needed to make nuclear warheads. The reactors
have been shut down for nearly a year, and feverish work is under
way to get them back in operation.
   Two endangered species can be found on the grounds: the wood
stork and the red-cockaded woodpecker, plus the protected American
alligator, which recently was taken off the national endangered
species list but is still considered threatened.
   Animals and plant life at the site are studied by teams of
scientists from the on-site Savannah River Ecology Laboratory,
which is run by the University of Georgia under contract with the
U.S. Department of Energy.
   Michael Smith, the lab's director, said in an interview that the
site's status as a high-security area isolated from the public
makes it a unique outdoor laboratory. In 1972, the site was
designated a National Environmental Research Park.
   ``It's a large area where animals can ... be free of human
interference,'' he said.
   The reactors were built in the early 1950s and are situated near
the center of the circular-shaped federal reservation, which abuts
the Savannah River and the Georgia border on its southwestern edge.
The site encompasses 300 square miles _ about equal in size to New
York city _ and is 17 miles across at its widest point.
   Much has changed in the four decades since the government took
over the land.
   _Cotton fields that once dotted the land are gone. In their
place are vast stretches of Loblolly pine trees that the U.S.
Forest Service harvests and replants in an operation that site
officials say earns $2 million a year for the Treasury.
   _Whole towns have disappeared. Among them is Ellington, whose
residents were uprooted to enable the government to isolate the
weapons complex from the civilian population. Some former residents
today live in New Ellington, just outside the site boundary.
   _Stretches of cyprus and tupelo trees have been killed off by
the effects of heated water discharged from the reactors' cooling
system into creeks that feed the swamplands.
   With the cypruses went the spotted sunfish that inhabited the
tree-lined swamps, Smith said. In their place now are red-breast
sunfish and dramatically higher numbers of mosquito fish, which
thrive on the altered vegetation, he said.
   Scientists on the site are still studying the effects on
wildlife from the reactor's hot-water discharges, Smith said,
adding, ``It is not a settled issue.''
   But on balance, Smith says, the presence of radioactivity and
toxic wastes has not hurt the site's wildlife and ecosystem. The 34
million gallons of high-level solid waste are placed in yellow
steel boxes, buried in trenches and covered with four feet of soil.
   ``In general, the animals have benefited,'' Smith said, many
because they are isolated from human predators.
   The American alligator population, for example, has prospered.
Its numbers in Park Pond, a manmade lake into which hot water from
the reactor is discharged, have almost doubled over the past 10
years, to about 400, Smith said.
   White-tailed deer, which numbered fewer than 100 in the early
1950s, have multiplied so quickly that a limited number of local
residents are brought onto the site for a hunt once a year. The
deer population has been stabilized at about 2,500, Smith said.
   Ms. Hart said that while animals on the site may be faring well,
her group is concerned about the radiation that ducks and some
other wildlife may carry off the site.
   ``It's the impact not on the animals but on the humans that eat
them that is the problem,'' she said, adding that off-site health
studies have not been conclusive.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Fulbright Says Radical Surgery Needed on Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Sen. J. William Fulbright says the
federal government has been so weakened by bickering and stalemate
that the time has come for radical surgery on the Constitution.
   Fulbright's solution: Move away from the Constitution's system
of checks and balances and separation of powers, and move toward
parliamentary democracy.
   The suggestion comes from a former longtime chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee well known for his pitched
battles with the White House over the Vietnam War.
   The Arkansas Democrat, now a Washington attorney, acknowledges
he is taking on ``a sacred cow.''
   ``We have come to regard our constitutional system as we regard
the Bible,'' Fulbright says in a new book, ``The Price of Empire,''
published by Pantheon Books.
   ``Like the Chinese emperor of old, our presidential office, if
not the presidents themselves, is perceived as invested with the
mandate of heaven,'' he writes. ``It is a matter of blind faith,
not common sense.''
   As diagnosed by Fulbright, a senator from 1945 until his 1974
defeat, the problem is serious and getting worse.
   ``Our political system is functioning very poorly today,'' he
says. ``It is proving almost impossible either to seriously debate
an important issue or to arrive at a consensus on how to handle it.
   ``We have celebrated our system of checks and balances for so
long that we now ignore the ways in which it weakens our government
with a dynamic of adversarial relationships that frustrates any
coherent policy.''
   As Fulbright sees it, the executive branch is kept in check by
Congress and Congress is kept in check by the executive branch, a
situation that becomes worse when one party controls the White
House and another controls the Congress.
   ``The inevitable result is acute bickering, polemical stalemate
and governmental paralysis,'' Fulbright says.
   A case in point: The inability in recent years to agree on a
budget or on ways to reduce or end the budget deficit.
   ``I suggest that the perpetuation of the resulting situation and
our inability to correct it is to a great extent due to the rivalry
between executive and legislature that is inherent in our system of
separation of the powers of government,'' Fulbright says.
   Fulbright contends that the separation of those powers, coupled
with the diversity of the American people, the decline of the
political party system and the growth of special interests, blocks
orderly and productive government.
   ``In practice, the separation of powers does not protect the
interests of the community or of the individual citizen; on the
contrary, it subjects them to exploitation by the special
interests,'' he contends.
   Echoing the complaint of many foreign leaders, Fulbright says
the divided nature of the American government under the
Constitution makes it all but impossible for a president to make an
ironclad foreign policy commitment.
   ``When the prime minister of a parliamentary democracy signs on
the dotted line, you can be sure, in most instances, that the
agreement is going to be approved,'' he says. ``You cannot be sure
under our system.''
   Congress can block most agreements signed by the president,
Fulbright notes.
   And he says a failure of the American system lies in the
inability of Congress to end debate after a reasonable period and
reach a final decision.
   The result, he says, is a perpetual tug-of-war in which
presidents over time become isolated and arbitrary and Congress
becomes quarrelsome and increasingly irrelevant.
   The attractiveness of a parliamentary system lies, in part, in
the ability of parliament to call a prime minister before it for
direct, intense, head-to-head questioning and confrontation,
Fulbright contends.
   As the American system is constructed, he says, ``no president
ever has to explain his views in detail, or reconcile them with
criticisms or suggestions made by others.''
   Fulbright's solution: Divide the country into 535 districts
representing the current 100 senators and 435 House members and
hold elections for a national one-House Congress or parliament.
   ``In this highly democratic fashion we could choose a
representative Congress or `parliament,' from whose number a
president or `prime minister' would then be chosen in precisely the
same manner in which presidents of well-run corporations or
universities are chosen _ by peer review,'' he says.
   Had such a system been in place over the last several decades,
Fulbright says, there would have been a better-than-even chance
that such legislative leaders as former Senate Republican leader
Howard H. Baker or the late Sen. Richard B. Russell, D-Ga., would
have been chosen prime minister.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists who just a few months ago
had high hopes of finding an ally in President Bush are beginning
to complain that his pro-environment promises contained more
rhetoric than substance.
   ``The honeymoon isn't over, but I think we're in a shaky
period,'' Jack Lorenz, president of the Isaak Walton League, said
last week as the leaders of nine environmental groups held a news
conference to chastise Bush for several personnel appointments and
the government's response to the Alaska oil spill.
   ``Clearly we've got problems on our hands. And it looks like a
long siege is at hand,'' said Michael McCloskey, chairman of the
Sierra Club. Other environmental leaders said that aside from the
appointment of William Reilly, a lifelong conservationist, as head
of the Environmental Protection Agency, they have had little to
cheer about.
   Environmentalists concede there have been some pluses other than
the Reilly appointment: a decision contrary to the Reagan
administration to work aggressively for revisions in federal clean
air laws including provisions to combat acid rain; a decision to
push internationally for 100 percent elimination of
chlorofluorocarbons, blamed for depleting high-altitude ozone;
Reilly's intervention in building the Two Forks dam in Colorado;
and a promise to review three offshore drilling plans near
California and the Florida Everglades.
   But the complaints have been loud over several critical
sub-Cabinet nominations by Bush involving posts close to
environmentalists' hearts; the administration's continued overall
support of new oil exploration, particularly in the Alaska National
Wildlife Refuge; and the response to the oil tanker accident in
Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   They complained that Bush hasn't moved quickly enough to take
control of the oil spill cleanup away from the Exxon Corp., whose
tanker ran aground and tore open March 24, spilling more than 10
million gallons of crude.
   George Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society, noted that
three national parks are in the oil's path. ``It is the federal
government's responsibility to prevent this damage,'' he said.
   ``Mr. President, this is your Boston Harbor,'' declared Roger
McManus, president of the Center for Marine Conservation. Pollution
in Boston Harbor became a campaign issue last year as Bush sought
to gain an edge on environmental issues over Democrat Michael
Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts.
   The president acknowledged last Friday that Exxon's efforts were
inadequate and said the U.S. Coast Guard would take increased
control of the cleanup, but critics suggested that assessment was
far too slow in coming from the White House.
   But the controversy over the oil spill is not all that has
widened the gulf between the president and the environmentalists.
   The major environmental and conservation groups had hoped Bush
would reverse the Reagan administration conclusion that oil
development should _ with congressional approval _ proceed in the
Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The president has refused to do so
and declares that he sees no link to drilling in the refuge and the
Alaska spill.
   Personnel decisions also have riled environmental groups, most
notably the nomination of James Cason as an assistant secretary of
agriculture overseeing the U.S. Forest Service.
   As a senior Interior Department official in the Reagan
administration, Cason was accused of consistently taking a
pro-development stand on public lands issues and being the
architect of various efforts in recent years favoring mining and
oil interests.
   Cason, as well as several other officials already nominated or
about to be nominated to senior posts at Interior, once worked for
Interior Secretary James Watt, who was broadly attacked as being
insensitive to environmental concerns.
   ``These (personnel) actions blow a huge hole in the president's
claim to be an environmentalists,'' said Gaylord Nelson, the former
Wisconsin senator and now counsel for the Wilderness Society. ``It
is clear that the house that Watt built is still standing. Instead
of being torn down, it's receiving a new paint job.''
   Bush's interior secretary, Manuel Lujan Jr., a former
congressman from New Mexico, also has raised eyebrows in the
environmental and conservation communities.
   In one interview he suggested that economic concerns should be
taken into consideration when deciding when wildlife should be
declared an endangered species _ a position environmentalists say
represents a sharp change in the interpretation of the Endangered
Species Act.
   Lujan also has been criticized for suggesting that there are
few, if any, instances of public lands harmed by excessive grazing,
a comment that prompted the National Wildlife Federation to send
him a letter citing various studies that have raised concerns about
grazing abuses on lands managed by the Interior Department.

   The last national newspaper on Fleet Street, once
London's rumbustious newspaper row, has made its final press run
there with British journalism trading the typewriters' clatter for
the quiet of high technology.
   Behind the gleaming, black glass facade of the art deco Express
building, reporters, editors and technicians crated the contents of
desks, packed up their memories, and sent off the final Fleet
Street edition of the Sunday Express before moving to new
headquarters.
   When the last bundle of papers was tied up Sunday and dispatched
around the country, all was silent where for decades typewriters
clacked, linotype machines rattled, and presses hummed.
   Express Newspapers group is moving only a few hundred yards
across the River Thames to a new, 10-story building with computers
and other modern newspaper technology.
   But the site is a million spiritual miles from the noisy
exuberance of Fleet Street 89 years ago, when the Daily Express was
the new kid on the block. The Sunday Express was founded by Lord
Beaverbrook in 1918, and its celebrated building went up in 1931.
   The British are avid newspaper readers. For nearly 300 years,
the country's national papers were all published on or near Fleet
Street. The short, crowded street and adjoining warren of alleys
and hidden courtyards were abuzz around the clock with journalists
rushing to meet deadlines.
   The national newspapers have moved away one by one to
computerized facilities since publisher Rupert Murdoch began the
exodus in 1986. That year, his four newspapers _ The Times, The
Sunday Times, The Sun and The News of The World _ moved to the
developing Docklands, breaking the hold of unions fighting
high-technology encroachments on their jobs.
   The Reuters and Press Association news agencies will remain at
their Fleet Street headquarters, some of the last representatives
of the British journalists who made Fleet Street synonymous with
``news.''
   For Express journalists, the changes will be dramatic.
   ``A lot of the processes we're using here tonight were much the
same as they were in the 1930s,'' news editor Henry MacRory said
Saturday night as the final edition went to bed. ``It was very much
typewriters _ and pretty old typewriters at that.''
   ``There are crates, thousands of them I should think, in every
office, packed up with all the clutter we're taking across with us:
telephone books, old contacts books, stories you've kept, all the
mementos of Fleet Street.''
   The old Express building has been bought by The Guardian
Exchange Group and a Japanese property developer for $136 million.
They plan to use it as an office building, but its black and chrome
facade will be remain in place under a historic preservation order.
   In the Express building, nicknamed ``the Black Lubyanka'' after
the Soviet KGB complex, Sunday Express Editor Robin Esser said his
own goodbye Saturday night:
   ``We bid farewell to the Black Lubyanka tonight, farewell to a
500-year tradition in the most famous home of journalism _ Fleet
Street ... But we will always be Fleet Street journalists.''
   The last edition of the broadsheet from the old plant carries a
brief farewell that reminds readers of Fleet Street's nicknames:
``Grub Street'' and ``Street of Shame.''
   ``But we were never ashamed of it _ or not often,'' the
newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   A bulky report that exposes greed, graft
and arrogance among top politicians outlines the first major
scandal to rock President Robert Mugabe's 9-year-old government.
   But Mugabe is getting kudos for allowing the probe to take place
at all.
   The report's authors are Judge Wilson Sandura and two prominent
civilians who sat for more than two months in Harare's High Court,
packed by spectators who enjoyed seeing their leaders squirm under
interrogation.
   Some 60 witnesses testified, and even before the report was sent
to Mugabe, two Cabinet ministers quit their government and party
posts after being caught lying to the panel.
   The usually timid state-controlled media demanded punishment for
some of the other luminaries summoned before the commission, among
them six Cabinet ministers, two junior ministers, several civil
servants and the army commander.
   While the probe identified corruption in the party hierarchy, it
also won Mugabe praise for ordering some of his staunchest aides to
face the embarrassment of being quizzed in public.
   ``This could never happen anywhere else in black Africa,'' said
a West African diplomat.
   The Daily Nation, an independent newspaper in Kenya's capital of
Nairobi, praised Mugabe for his openness and suggested that a
corruption probe in Africa is as rare as rain in the Sahara.
   In a continent where contemporary politicians often behave like
autocratic tribal chiefs of old, scores of Zimbabweans crowded into
the courtroom to snigger, sneer and jeer at the VIPs on the witness
stand.
   When Higher Education Minister Dzingai Mutumbuka refused under
cross-examination to produce bank statements, the public gallery
erupted into laughter and booing.
   Angered, the minister pointed at the hecklers, pounded the box
and shouted: ``One fool at a time, please!''
   The probe that shook the nation involved the purchase of cars
and trucks from the Willowvale assembly plant by ministers and
their friends at low fixed prices.
   The commission investigated allegations that some top officials
used their influence to jump waiting lines for vehicles and then
resold the cars on the black market for up to five times what they
paid.
   Zimbabwe, independent from Britain only since April 18, 1980,
has suffered a dire shortage of cars because of a lack of hard
currency. Would-be buyers can wait up to 10 years for a new vehicle.
   But the Cabinet last year decided to give some government
officials the right to buy one vehicle each at the fixed state
price.
   One senior minister admitted to the investigating panel that he
had helped 38 friends buy cars, but he insisted he had not taken a
penny in return.
   Army Commander Tapfumaneyi Mujuru conceded he had bought a car
and sold it at a profit of about $2,500.
   Charges against those allegedly involved could range from price
control violations and sales tax evasion, which usually bring
nominal fines, to perjury, which carries a maximum prison sentence
of five years.
   Meanwhile, the crusading newspaper editor who lifted the veil on
``Willowgate,'' Geoff Nyarota, has disappeared from public view and
is staying mum.
   Officially, Nyarota was transferred from the Chronicle in
Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second-largest city, to a public relations job
at the Harare headquarters of Zimbabwe Newspapers Ltd., the
state-controlled group that owns most of the country's papers.
   But many readers are convinced the editor's move to a post that
previously did not exist was the result of pressure from above.
They recall that Nyarota was threatened with detention by Defense
Minister Enos Nkala before the minister resigned in the midst of
the commission probe.
   Many Zimbabweans fear the silencing of Nyarota could mean that
future scandals might be hushed up.
   But Mugabe has promised the probe report will be made public in
its entirety after he has finished reading it.

   Organizers of the abortion rights march on the
nation's Capitol fumed at a police estimate that put their crowd of
supporters at only 300,000.
   ``We aren't going to let them deny us our numbers,'' said
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority and
one of the march organizers who claim more than 600,000 people
turned out for Sunday's rally.
   Both estimates showed the demonstration was larger than the
approximately 250,000 people organizers had predicted would turn
out, but still supporters felt cheated by the police estimate.
   ``This was no ordinary march. We took over the city,'' Smeal
said during the rally that closed down the streets around the
Capitol and the Mall and flooded the West side of the Capitol with
activists.
   She suggested that Bush administration politics were at play,
noting that the U.S. Park Police, one of three law enforcement
authorities involved in making the estimate, ``report to the White
House.''
   ``They always low-ball our numbers,'' she added.
   Smeal said march organizers, which included the National
Organization for Women and Planned Parenthood, consulted with
architectural and landscape engineers in coming up with their
figure of 600,000.
   The 300,000 estimate was made jointly by the U.S. Park Police,
which has jurisdiction over federal property; the U.S. Capitol
Police, whose force covers the Capitol grounds; and the District of
Columbia Metropolitan Police, who cover city properties.
   ``The three police agencies are very good at estimating crowds
because we do it so often,'' said Dan Nichols, a spokesman for the
Capitol Police.
   He and Michael Braxton, a spokesman for the Park Police,
dismissed suggestions that their count was politically motivated.
   ``All we do is give an accurate count,'' Braxton said,
explaining that in this march as in most large rallies officers
view the crowd from helicopters and then estimate the size based on
grid maps, which divide the area into sections.
   ``It doesn't make any difference to us how many turn out,''
Nichols said. ``We don't have anything to gain or lose.''
   He added that rally organizers invariably dispute police crowd
estimates, but he said that because Sunday's march was so large
``it leaves more room for a gap.''

   Mothers, daughters and even granddaughters
took their places in the massive march on the nation's Capitol as
generations joined the show of solidarity for a woman's right to
choose an abortion.
   Norma Melbourne, who took her daughter Dylan to the women's
rights march in New York City back in August 1970, joined both her
daughter and her 2-year-old granddaughter, Honore Ford, at Sunday's
demonstration that attracted more than 300,000 from the Washington
Monument to the steps of the Capitol. Organizers estimated the
turnout at closer to 600,000.
   ``We're here so she'll never have to come again,'' Dylan
Melbourne of Gaithersburg, Md., said of the fair-haired toddler
seated quietly in her stroller.
   ``We have taken it for granted that they had choices,'' said
Norma Melbourne.
   She recalled stories of ``little places in Pennsylvania and
Mexico'' where women had to go to obtain abortions before the
Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade in 1973.
   Patricia Rocket, 61, of Lewes, Del., also has heard the stories
of back-alley abortions and brought her 81-year-old mother, Evelyn
Pope, to protest any possible change in the law.
   ``It scares me to death to think of going back to before Roe vs.
Wade,'' Rocket said.
   Nearby, Ella Byrnes, also 81, of Muncie, Ind., raised a homemade
sign which said ``Indiana Republicans for Choice,'' and in smaller
letters claimed that former President Reagan was pro-choice.
   ``My mother was in a class ahead of Reagan's at Eureka
College,'' said Barbara Maves, who said that Reagan, as president
of the student council, was a big supporter of individual rights.
   ``The Republican philosophy is basically individual rights,''
said Nancy Grundmann, of Kokomo, Ind., who left her home at 4 a.m.
Saturday to make the march. ``I wanted the rest of the United
States to know many Republicans are pro-choice.''

   Progress seems agonizingly slow in the war
on cancer, but scientists are seeking small gains on many fronts to
turn the tide against the nation's No. 2 killer.
   ``The major breakthroughs in cancer are few and far between, and
have taken place over decades,'' said Dr. Harold Freeman, president
of the American Cancer Society.
   Still, he said, ``progress has been remarkable.''
   In 1930, one of five U.S. cancer patients had survived five
years. In 1988, nearly 50 percent did.
   The society expects cancer _ the uncontrolled growth and spread
of abnormal cells _ to kill 502,000 Americans this year.
Cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke claim
nearly 1 million Americans yearly.
   Critics have called the war on cancer a failure because overall
cancer incidence and death rates keep rising, even when statistics
are corrected for the increasing percentage of cancer-prone older
citizens. They say inadequate attention is paid to prevention,
including reduction of carcinogenic pollutants.
   With cigarette-induced lung cancer responsible for much of the
average rise in cancer death rates, people have to stop smoking,
and take advantage of early detection techniques and the latest
treatments, said National Cancer Institute spokesman J. Paul Van
Nevel.
   Nevertheless, he said, research has put America ``on the verge
of seeing the advances everyone has hoped for.''
   Many recent advances were outlined here last week at the cancer
society's annual seminar for science writers. Among them:
   _An early version of a test that someday might be used to
determine individual vulnerability to cancer-causing substances has
been developed by Dr. Margaret Spitz and others at the University
of Texas. The test indicates how easily a person's basic genetic
information can be damaged by carcinogens.
   _A national Centers for Disease Control study showed X-ray
mammograms can be used to identify women who face an increased risk
of breast cancer, not just to detect such tumors once they appear.
   The two studies suggest new ways for doctors to identify people
facing a high cancer risk, educate them to reduce cancer-causing
behavior such as smoking, and closely monitor them to detect cancer
early enough for treatment.
   _A major research effort involves ``tumor suppressor genes'' or
anti-oncogenes, which are genetic instructions that serve
``nature's mechanism for stopping cancer cells before they get
started,'' the society said.
   Research shows genetic instructions from a normal cell can
return a cancer cell to normalcy, said chemist J. Carl Barrett of
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. That
suggests human cancers someday might be halted or reversed with
mass-produced anti-oncogenes.
   _A major problem with chemotherapy is that many patients
initially helped become resistant to the cancer-killing drugs, so
their cancer returns and kills them. Dr. William Dalton of the
University of Arizona temporarily reversed resistance in certain
patients by using a drug that helps keep chemotherapy drugs inside
tumor cells.
   _Chemotherapy also may be improved with drugs that attack
cancers more precisely on a biochemical level. Indiana University's
Dr. George Weber is testing a drug that counteracts a
cancer-promoting enzyme. It caused remission of leukemia in half a
small group of patients for whom all other chemotherapy failed.
   _Larger doses of chemotherapy kill more cancer cells but damage
patients' ability to make blood cells needed to prevent
life-threatening infections.
   Dr. Janice Gabrilove, of New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center, combined chemotherapy with a substance called G-CSF.
She found the combination allowed bladder cancer patients to
tolerate high-dose chemotherapy while suffering fewer infections.
   Another approach to the problem is to remove bone marrow, then
reimplant it after high-dose radiation and chemotherapy. Dr. Robert
Marcus Jr., of the University of Florida at Gainesville, found the
risky procedure nearly triples the 20 percent survival rate of
patients with a rare bone cancer.
   _National Cancer Institute biochemist David Segal said
researchers are removing tumor-fighting white blood cells from
cancer patients, linking the cells to ``monoclonal antibodies,''
then injecting them back into the patients.
   The method combines the antibodies' ability to track down cancer
cells with the white blood cells' ability to kill cancer. Segal
said the method blocks cancer growth in mice, and is being tested
on humans with ovarian cancer and one type of brain tumor.
   _The institute's Dr. Charles Evans is using a substance called
leukoregulin to make tumor cell membranes more permeable, thereby
making the cancers more vulnerable to chemotherapy and the body's
own immune system cells.
   _Biochemist Brian Ross of the Huntington Medical Research
Institute in Pasadena is using a method called magnetic resonance
spectroscopy to look for changes in brain chemistry that accompany
brain tumor growth. He said the method can allow doctors to monitor
chemotherapy's effectiveness and possibly detect the earliest
stages of a new tumor in time to treat it.

   She looked like just one of the hundreds of
thousands of other demonstrators at the Capitol, wearing a blue
sweatshirt with the words ``Roe v. Wade'' and a drawing of the
Supreme Court.
   By name, Norma McCorvey is just as anonymous.
   But she is also Jane Roe _ as in Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme
Court case that resulted in the landmark decision legalizing
abortion. And she's still speaking out, despite a recent shotgun
blast to her Texas home.
   ``Our law's in jeopardy,'' she told a handful of reporters at
Sunday's abortion rights rally, organized to focus attention on a
major challenge to the Roe vs. Wade ruling that is being considered
by the Supreme Court.
   For most of the afternoon, McCorvey simply sat at the foot of
the Capitol with a few friends, barely noticed by the hundreds of
Hollywood stars, rally volunteers and politicians who filled the
stage.
   For her, the attention she did get was almost too much.
   ``She's shaking,'' said Gloria Allred, a women's rights attorney
from Los Angeles who sat by McCorvey's side. ``She's not used to
all of this.''

   For Beth Shafran, a 31-year-old law student from San Francisco,
women's abortion rights were more important than her bar exam.
   ``I blew my bar exam money to do this,'' she said after Sunday's
rally, for which she flew across the country to attend.
   ``It was so important, especially with the Supreme Court hearing
the Webster case so soon,'' she said, referring to a Missouri case
before the court that could lead the justices to restrict abortion
rights.
   After being part of the demonstration with several hundred
thousand other women's rights activists, she said it was worth the
sacrifice.
   ``I'll wait another six months'' to take the exam, she said.

   Actress Cybill Shepherd said she was embarrassed to admit that
Sunday's abortion rights march was the first big demonstration
she's participated in.
   But when it came her turn to address the sea of people assembled

   ``I wanted my children, but no one has the right to force me to
have an unwanted child,'' she boomed to the crowd.
   Still, she bore the polish of Hollywood, wearing a long white
coat over a white blouse and purple sweatshirt _ the colors of the
march in honor of the suffragettes _ and carrying a Japanese-style

   ``I don't think this is just a women's issue,'' said Leonard

stories of women having the procedures performed ``on kitchen

   ``Nobody likes the idea of an abortion,'' said Nimoy, one of
dozens of celebrities who traveled to Washington for the rally.
``But if it has to happen, there should be freedom of choice.''

   Actress Valerie Harper was the last of the Hollywood contingent
to address the rally. Wearing a white dress and light sweater, she

   ``It's an outlandish success. It's extraordinary,'' she said.
``It sends a clear message there is a very widespread, deeply held

<TEXT>
   Vastly outnumbered but undeterred, several
hundred foes of abortion prayed and sang hymns in a symbolic
cemetery on the Washington Mall as hundreds of thousands of
abortion rights activists marched past.
   The mood inside the rust-red snow-fence bounding the ``Cemetery
of the Innocents'' was one of quiet devotion Sunday as
anti-abortion activists knelt amid 4,400 white wooden crosses and
Stars of David, the number of unborn they said are aborted every
day.
   But emotions sometimes ran high at the edge of the fence, where
several women held up enlarged color photographs of fetuses.
   ``I want people to see the other side. This is what they are
choosing when they choose abortions,'' said Susan Brimmer, of
Columbia, Md.
   A number of abortion rights activists, as they marched past the
cemetery to the Capitol, shouted ``Pro-Choice'' and other slogans,
but moved away when blue-helmeted police asked them to avoid
confrontation.
   About 200 to 300 anti-abortion protesters gathered in pockets
elsewhere on the parade route, displaying placards and trading
taunts with the marchers. Police, some on horseback, kept the
opposing groups apart.
   In one pocket, about 50 college men and women stood at the base
of Capitol Hill, holding up signs proclaiming that ``Abortion May
be Legal, but it is not Moral,'' and urging the Supreme Court to
``Overturn Roe Vs. Wade,'' the decision which has legalized
abortion since 1973.
   One of those women, Michelle Sheahan, a student at Wellesley
College, said she and 14 other abortion foes from her school rode
down from Massachusetts on buses filled with anti-abortion
activists.
   Their message, she said, was that ``abortion exploits women,''
and that ``no one can decide for the unborn child.''
   Ray Allen, head of the American Coalition for Life, which built
the symbolic cemetery, said he wanted to ``communicate the message
in a graphic way that abortion on demand kills children.''
   Allen, who moved to Washington from Dallas three years ago to
campaign against abortion, said he planned to return to Texas soon
``because the battle will be fought in the states.''
   If the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade, states likely would
have the authority to determine whether abortions would be legal
within their borders.
   Two women who said they underwent abortions told a news
conference before the demonstration that they now oppose the
operation.
   ``I will never forget the dream I had of my baby screaming as
the doctor ripped that baby from my womb,'' said Nora Whitten, of
Newark, Texas. ``Abortion is murder. Those involved in abortion
seem to realize this, but try to hide their feelings because they
are afraid to deal with the truth.''
   Nola Jones, of Vacaville, Calif., said she regrets two abortions
she had, in 1974 and 1977.
   ``I spent eight and one half years in denial, destroying myself
from what is now called post-abortion syndrome,'' said Jones,
executive director of an anti-abortion group called Victims of
Choice.

   A proposed constitutional amendment banning
abortions remains a long-range goal of the anti-abortion movement
but it is taking a back seat to the battle in the Supreme Court.
   Proposals for such an amendment were the main rallying cry of
the anti-abortion movement for years and have been endorsed by both
President Bush and former President Reagan.
   But Bush now says he will probably wait for the Supreme Court's
decision before undertaking any anti-abortion initiatives, and
Reagan is turning to other issues.
   An anti-abortion amendment was rejected by the Senate nearly six
years ago. The proposal has been reintroduced in the House and
Senate, but no action is scheduled.
   The Supreme Court, however, will hear arguments April 26 in a
case in which the state of Missouri, the Bush administration and
others seek to limit or reverse the court's 16-year-old ruling that
women have a constitutional right to abortion.
   ``Especially in recent years, the focus has been much more on
the court itself and the likelihood of a reversal rather than on
the much more onerous method of amending the Constitution,''
Douglas Johnson, legislative director of National Right to Life,
said in an interview.
   The only time an anti-abortion amendment has ever been voted
upon in either house of Congress was on June 28, 1983, when it
failed on a 50-49 vote in the Senate, well short of the required
two-thirds majority.
   In the House, no such measure has ever emerged from the
Judiciary Committee, which anti-abortion leaders say is
considerably more liberal on the abortion rights issue than the
House as a whole.
   If it received the necessary majority in both houses, the
amendment would still require ratification by three-fourths of the
states before it became part of the Constitution.
   The amendment that failed in 1983, sponsored by Sen. Orrin G.
Hatch, R-Utah, would have provided simply, ``A right to abortion is
not secured by this Constitution.'' That would have left it up to
state legislatures to decide whether to make abortions legal.
   The vote came just two weeks after the Supreme Court had struck
down a number of state and local limits on abortion in line with
the reasoning of its 1973 decision, known as Roe v. Wade. Since
then, the court's conservative wing has been strengthened by the
addition of Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy,
encouraging abortion foes to believe it may reverse position.
   Johnson said the high court has reversed itself on major
constitutional issues about 150 times, whereas court rulings have
been overturned by constitutional amendment only four times, on
issues including the 18-year voting age and the constitutionality
of the income tax.
   Reagan urged the Senate of six years ago to ``make its voice
heard against abortion on demand ... whether by statute or
constitutional amendment'' and lobbied senators by telephone on the
issue.
   On his flight to California after leaving office Jan. 20, he
listed ``a change with regard to the abortion situation'' as among
the issues he planned to be taking ``to the people'' as an
ex-president.
   His spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said, however, that the former
president has not mentioned the abortion amendment in prepared
speeches he has delivered since leaving office, although he has
plugged a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and
a line-item veto for presidents.
   ``I am certain, though, that as he said on the airplane he will
discuss that issue in coming months,'' Weinberg said by telephone
from Los Angeles. ``He has spoken about some issues, and will be
speaking about others.''
   Reagan has endorsed the amendment backed by National Right to
Life, which would allow abortions only when necessary to save the
life of the mother. Bush has said he would broaden the exception to
include cases of rape and incest.
   Bush, asked on Jan. 27 whether he planned any new anti-abortion
initiatives or would wait for the Supreme Court, said, ``I think
probably wait, but I have been pledged, as you know, to an
amendment. But I'd like to see the Supreme Court decision as soon
as possible.''
   On Jan. 25, Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, introduced the latest
version of the anti-abortion amendment. This amendment, more
far-reaching than the one defeated in 1983, would declare the
unborn to be persons and provide, ``No unborn person shall be
deprived of life by any person'' with the exception that it would
not bar ``a law permitting only those medical procedures required
to prevent the death of the mother.'' Similar measures have been
introduced in the House. Neither the House nor Senate Judiciary
Committee has scheduled any action.
   ``I frankly do not think that there is any chance, with the
current makeup of Congress, that a human life amendment would pass.
I don't think it would even get out of committee,'' said Nancy
Broff, legislative and political director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League.
   Johnson said Right to Life regards such an amendment as ``our
long term goal, but we would be happy for incremental progress, and
we see overturning Roe v. Wade as a big step toward that goal.''
   Meanwhile one state has adopted an anti-abortion constitutional
amendment. Arkansas voters approved an amendment in November, by a
margin of 58 to 42 per cent, making it ``state policy to protect
the life of every unborn child from conception until birth to the
extent permitted by the federal Constitution.''
   So long as the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution as
guaranteeing women the right to have abortions, the Arkansas
measure can't be applied to prohibit them. If the court reverses
itself, action by the state legislature would probably be necessary
to make them illegal, observers in Little Rock have said. Arkansas
laws currently permit abortions so long as they are performed by
doctors.

   When the Environmental Protection Agency tried
to crack down on U.S. government polluters two years ago, a Justice
Department official was accused of sabotaging the effort and making
EPA ``the enforcement eunuch'' of the government.
   House members and EPA officials directed their criticism at F.
Henry Habicht II, who now has been recommended by EPA Administrator
William K. Reilly as the agency's No. 2 official.
   Habicht is working as an EPA consultant while he waits for
President Bush's nomination as deputy administrator, said EPA
spokesman David Cohen, who described Reilly's choice as ``one of
the brightest and toughest environmental enforcers in town.''
   Habicht, 35, admittedly was a key architect in developing the
Justice Department policy that forced EPA to negotiate with U.S.
government polluters, instead of handing them orders to clean up
their hazardous waste.
   Internal EPA memos in 1986-87 called the policy ``unlawful''
because it was more lenient toward government than private
polluters, and warned the double standard could ``severely damage''
EPA's credibility.
   EPA officials said in interviews last week the policy has
allowed the defense and energy departments to stonewall
negotiations involving their facilities, thereby delaying
agreements at some of the nation's worst pollution sites.
   An EPA source, speaking only on condition he not be named, said
the ``practical effect'' of Habicht's policy ``is it takes longer
than it should to correct violations'' at federal facilities.
   ``We spend too much time negotiating because there's no order
that would culminate the negotiating process,'' the source said.
   ``The idea behind orders is that people are not going to screw
around if they know EPA has delegated authority from the president
to make the decision on what needs to be done.''
   Habicht resigned as the chief of the Justice Department's land
and natural resources division in 1987, shortly after his testimony
before Congress on the negotiation policy. He has worked since for
an environmental consulting firm that was headed by former EPA
Administrator William D. Ruckelshaus.
   Cohen said Reilly chose Habicht because he's ``one of the most
capable environmental managers. Anyone who knows Hank Habicht knows
he is first-rate.''
   Defending Habicht's actions two years ago, Cohen said there were
``constitutional problems'' with EPA's administrative orders to
other agencies, and Habicht ``has not ruled out administrative
orders as a possible tool.''
   ``It was a strictly legal consideration, and I don't think it
reflects, as some would lead you to believe, in any way negatively
on Hank Habicht's determination to get on with the job of federal
facilities cleanup _ and also with making sure that federal
facilities are treated as much as possible as polluters are treated
in the private sector.''
   Other EPA officials also described Habicht as a committed
environmentalist, despite his rough treatment in April 1987 when he
appeared before the House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee.
   Panel Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich., predicted the
negotiation policy would make EPA ``the enforcement eunuch of the
federal agencies, and with regard to federal facilities, its
failures and the penalties that will be suffered by the public will
be noteworthy.''
   Other committee members called the policy ``a prescription for
non-enforcement of the country's environmental laws'' and said it
created a ``double standard between federal agency polluters and
private industry.''
   Sen. Quentin N. Burdick, chairman of the Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee, said the panel is checking into the
controversy, since it would conduct Habicht's confirmation hearing.
   ``The committee will definitely look into this matter and his
other work at the Justice Department, if he is nominated,''
Burdick, D-N.D., said. ``I am concerned about the theory which
limit's EPA's ability to ensure that federal agencies comply with
federal environmental laws.''
   A spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., a committee member,
said the controversy is ``extremely disturbing.'' But the
spokesman, Craig Varoga, said Reid has an ``open mind'' on the
nomination, and has ``the greatest enthusiasm for providing Mr.
Reilly with all the proper support he needs.''

<HEAD>Poll Finds Most Australians Indifferent To Hawke's Infidelity Confession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most Australians do not care that Prime
Minister Bob Hawke has been unfaithful to his wife and he gained no
political advantage from the tearful confession on television,
according to a poll published today.
   The survey, published in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper,
was the first major poll on the matter.
   Some critics had suggested that Hawke's teary-eyed admission
during an interview on national television on March 21 was a
calculated ploy to win votes for his governing Australian Labor
Party.
   But 70 percent of those questioned in a random national
telephone survey of 1,000 people were indifferent. One in four
thought less of Hawke after the confession, and 5 percent thought
more of him, according to the survey.
   The poll was conducted by Irving Saulwick &amp; Associates from
April 3-5 and has a 3 percent margin of error.
   During the TV interview, Hawke said his wife, Hazel, had
understood his infidelity and that he still loved her.
   The couple celebrated their 33rd wedding anniversary two weeks
before the interview, in which Hawke also spoke of his past
drinking habits.
   Commenting on the poll results, the Herald said: ``Do
Australians put their leaders on a pedestal of morality? It would
seem not.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should pursue a cautious
strategy toward the Soviet Union, tempering new initiatives with
skepticism about President Mikhail Gorbachev's intentions,
President Bush's national security adviser says.
   Brent Scowcroft maintained on Sunday that the Western strategy
of projecting ``strength and determination'' in dealings with the
Kremlin has been successful. He cited Gorbachev's withdrawal from
Afghanistan and indications the Soviet economic system is in
trouble.
   At the same time, both Scowcroft and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III acknowledged in national television interviews that Bush
administration officials remain immersed in a substantial
interagency review of East-West relations.
   Scowcroft labeled as ``premature'' published reports saying Bush
already had been advised by a policy task force to pursue a
basically status-quo policy toward the Soviets.
   ``We have initial results from the study by the bureaucratic
interagency process,'' he said on NBC-TV's ``Meet The Press.'' But
Scowcroft said ``it's probably not surprising that the future looks
a lot like the present, in a sort of straight-line projection. But
we're not there yet.''
   Baker, interviewed on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
brushed aside complaints by Gorbachev that the go-slow U.S. policy
stance has jeopardized momentum for agreement on a treaty to slash
the superpowers' strategic nuclear stockpiles.
   ``We are conducting a policy review,'' Baker said. ``We have
told the Soviets _ as long ago as a month _ that we anticipated
that these reviews would be completed about the end of April.''
   He also said he ``would be prepared to discuss some of these
issues'' during his scheduled meeting in Moscow in early May with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   ``So they've known what our time frame and timetable was for
quite some time,'' Baker said, ``so it's sort of interesting to see
this statement only coming out now.''
   Scowcroft, a retired Air Force general, was asked to comment on
reports that Bush had been advised to steer a cautious course
toward the Soviets and to be wary of Gorbachev's promises of reform
in Russia.
   ``A major power like the United States ought not to make sharp,
dramatic changes in policy,'' he said. ``We've had a fairly
consistent policy now, through Democratic and Republican
administrations, for 40 years. ... A lot of things are happening
and it's important now, perhaps for the first administration in a
long time, to look out ahead, to look toward the end of the
century, and say, `Where do we want to be?'
   ``There's no question that we have every reason to look back on
the past 40 years and say we've been successful,'' Scowcroft added.
   An administration official, discussing the internal policy
review on grounds of anonymity, said the initial policy report
advised Bush to pursue no major new initiatives.
   Bush asked his advisers to ``take another look another time at
the whole situation'' after receiving recommendations on relations
with the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and East-West relations, the
official said. Three such reports are part of a major foreign
policy review Bush initiated as he took office in January.
   In relations with the Soviet Union, ``I don't see anything
new,'' the official said, adding that there apparently was ``not
much to change right now.'' The reports were given to Bush during
meetings of the National Security Council over the past 10 days, he
said.
   Scowcroft said he feels that Gorbachev is ``dynamic, modern ...
dedicated to change'' in the Soviet Union. ``But what is in doubt
is what the character of that change and what his motivation for
change is. And there is a major question.''
   The national security adviser said ``the evidence so far is
mixed'' on Gorbachev's true intentions. ``So I think it's too early
to assess how much he's really dedicated to substantive change,''
he said.

   Police have arrested one of the world's most
wanted cocaine dealers, a Mexican who has also been accused of
links to the killing of a U.S. drug agent, the federal attorney
general's office said Sunday.
   Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, called the godfather of Mexican
drug trafficking, was arrested late Saturday in Guadalajara in the
western state of Jalisco, the prosecutor's office said in a
statement.
   Numerous high-powered weapons were also seized by members of the
Federal Judicial Police, the statement said. It said Felix
Gallardo, 43, put up no resistance. He is thought to run one of the
largest cocaine trafficking operations in the world.
   A U.S. official welcomed news of the arrest. ``We're delighted
to hear that. This is most interesting,'' said William Graves, a
U.S. embassy spokesman, on Sunday night.
   The government news agency Notimex reported that Felix Gallardo
and four others also arrested have been flown to Mexico City, 300
miles east of Guadalajara.
   In another development, authorities said the entire police force
of the city of Culiacan, in the northwestern state of Sinaloa, was
arrested in a massive sweep Saturday night.
   All 70 to 80 police officers were set free Sunday with the
exception of Police Chief Robespier Lisarraja and State Police
Chief Arturo Moreno, who remained in military custody at a local
army base, said Jorge Gonzalez, spokesman for the federal attorney
generals' office in Culiacan.
   Gonzalez could not say why the entire police force was arrested
or on what charges the chiefs were being held. Culiacan is Felix
Gallardo's hometown and has long had a reputation for official
corruption.
   Agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration long had
suspected Felix Gallardo of involvement in the 1985 slaying of
fellow agent Enrique Camarena Salazar, but were unable to locate
him.
   U.S. officials investigating Camarena killing said Felix
Gallardo was able to build up an immense drug operation with
protection from high Mexican officials, including a state governor.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office on Dec. 1,
has pledged to crack down on drug dealers, and the arrest
underlines Salinas' vow to ``fight this social cancer,'' the
attorney general's office said.
   Called the godfather of Mexican drug trafficking, Felix Gallardo
had such good connections that U.S. drug agents said Mexican agents
were afraid to find him, according to the recently published book
``Desperados'' by Elaine Shannon.
   Felix Gallardo was at one time a member of the Sinaloa state
police and bodyguard for former Gov. Leopoldo Sanchez Celis until
1980. The DEA believes he introduced cocaine smuggling to Mexican
marijuana rings in the mid-1970s, Shannon said.
   At one time in the mid-1980s the DEA believed Felix Gallardo was
responsible for the smuggling of 1{ to 2 tons of cocaine monthly
from South America into the United States, according to Shannon's
book.
   The United States has been pressuring Mexico to stem the flow of
drugs across the border. Mexico has countered that the U.S. demand
for drugs fuels the Mexican narcotics trade.
   Some U.S. congressmen, including Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., have
accused Mexico of widespread official corruption and maintain that
certification should be denied.

   An animal rights activist ran up a 30-foot
ramp in an attempt to stop a diving mule act but was arrested and
the show went on.
   ``There comes a time in every person's life when they have to
take a risk for what they believe in,'' said 58-year-old Noelle
Valentine. ``I believe in the rights of animals very deeply.''
   Valentine charged up the ramp as the performance was scheduled
to start Friday. She shouted anti-cruelty slogans and some
spectators jeered.
   ``Jump!'' some of them yelled.
   A police officer and the Lake County Fair's operator accompanied
Valentine back to the ground, and she was charged with trespassing
and resisting arrest without violence.
   Earlier Friday, county animal control officer Frankie Thorp
watched a 15-year-old mule named Kit dive into the pool of water
and determined the act was not cruel.
   The Leesburg and Lake County humane societies, however, insisted
the act was cruel.
   ``It's not a natural act,'' said Dan Davis, a Lake County Humane
Society investigator. ``That's got to do damage to the poor animal.
If I do a belly flop at 30 feet, it's gonna hurt. If I do it more
than once, it's going to really hurt internally.''

   Vietnam's 10-year military occupation
of Cambodia has proved a costly adventure that deprived the
Vietnamese of international support they desperately needed to
rebuild after years of conflict with the United States.
   Vietnam announced Wednesday it would withdraw its remaining
50,000-70,000 troops from Cambodia by Sept. 30.
   A complete withdrawal without a political settlement would be
strikingly similar to the Soviet pullout from Afghanistan or the
American departure from Vietnam.
   In each case, foreign military intervention fell short of the
goal of defeating insurgents and guaranteeing a stable, friendly
regime. Vietnam faces the prospect of seeing the very group it
sought to defeat, the communist Khmer Rouge, re-emerge in power.
   But the cost of maintaining the occupation has proven too high.
The United States has refused to discuss establishing diplomatic
relations with Hanoi until the Cambodian issue is resolved. That
stand has blocked aid Vietnam's government has begun to seek to
rebuild its nation.
   In June, Vietnam acknowledged that 25,000 of its troops had been
killed in Cambodia and 30,000 others had died in border clashes
before the 1978 invasion.
   The occupation also has cost Vietnam a chance to expand trade
ties with non-communist Southeast Asian nations.
   Vietnam launched its invasion on Christmas Day 1978, three years
after Hanoi's forces toppled the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese
government in Saigon, now Ho Chi Minh City.
   The Vietnamese moved into Cambodia to oust the brutal
administration of the Khmer Rouge, which had killed hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians in a campaign to reshape agriculture and
society.
   By January 1979, Vietnamese troops had driven the Khmer Rouge to
the Thai border and installed Heng Samrin in power in Phnom Penh.
   But the Vietnamese found, like the Soviets in Afghanistan and
the Americans in Vietnam, that it is easier to invade than depart.
   In February 1979, China launched a brief but bloody border war
to ``teach Vietnam a lesson.'' Vietnam inflicted heavy losses on
Chinese forces. But the conflict strained Vietnamese resources and
brought China into the Cambodian conflict as a source of military
and diplomatic support for the anti-Vietnamese resistance.
   On June 22, 1982, the Khmer Rouge and guerrillas loyal to Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, the former Cambodian monarch, and to former
Premier Son Sann announced a resistance coalition. That group
eventually claimed the country's seat in the United Nations.
   By then, the occupation was weighing heavily on Vietnam's
devastated economy. Finally, last June, Deputy Premier Vo Van Kiet
said the economy faced ``alarmingly complicated changes,''
including famine in the north and runaway inflation.
   Grain production in 1987 fell from 18.2 million tons to 17.6
million. Inflation was estimated at nearly 1,000 percent and
unemployment at about 20 percent.
   Faced with the mounting pressures, the Vietnamese Communist
Politburo met in September to discuss foreign policy in the
``post-Cambodian period.''
   Sources said the Politburo decided to reduce Vietnam's
dependence on the Soviet Union and seek closer ties to the West and
the pro-Western governments of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
   The plan, however, hinged on ending the Cambodian adventure.
   Vietnam withdrew its command staff in June, transferring
responsibility for running the war to the Cambodians. The Soviets
and Americans made similar moves in phasing out their troops in
Afghanistan and South Vietnam.
   A series of diplomatic moves led to inconclusive peace talks
between Sihanouk and Premier Hun Sen of the Vietnamese-backed
Cambodian government.
   The future role of the Khmer Rouge has been the major obstacle
to a political settlement. Both Vietnam and the United States have
strongly opposed a Khmer Rouge return to power.
   Western diplomats say fighting inside Cambodia declined last
year to its lowest level since the Vietnamese invasion. But the
diplomats believe the Khmer Rouge has been trying to avoid clashes
and build up arsenals for a showdown after the Vietnamese leave.
   The Khmer Rouge denies any intention to seize power.
   However, the Khmer Rouge is believed to be the strongest of the
three groups in the coalition led by Sihanouk. Western estimates
place the number of Khmer Rouge guerrillas at 30,000 to 40,000,
compared with 13,000 for the non-communist Khmer People's National
Liberation Armed Forces and 19,000 for Sihanouk's forces.
   If the conflict comes to a military head, the 30,000 to 40,000
government forces may be unable to prevail bereft of Vietnamese
help.

   Actor Kevin Costner counts ``The Big Chill'' as
the film that made him a better person _ even if his part ended up
on the cutting room floor.
   In an interview in May's Vanity Fair, Costner says getting his
part cut initially made him think that Hollywood would pass him by.
   ``But I had confidence that my career wasn't dependent on `The
Big Chill.' And I knew what a real American hero would feel: Look
I'm not in the movie, I don't want to get mileage out of that. Two
years from now, if I emerge, it will be an interesting story.''
   And emerge he did with starring or co-starring roles in ``No Way

   It was ``The Golden Girls''' big night out
and the now-closed Coconut Grove nightclub was returned to its
one-time splendor for a black-tie gala to celebrate the popular
NBC-TV comedy's 100th episode.
   The show's stars, Bea Arthur, Estelle Getty, Rue McClanahan and
Betty White, joined Walt Disney Studio's chief Michael Eisner, NBC
President Brandon Tartikoff and several hundred staff members and
associates Saturday night in toasting the Emmy award-winning
program.
   ``It's not only a show that has the four best actresses on
television, it truly is the best program in television in the last
decade or two,'' said Eisner, whose company distributes the series.
   ``Thank you for this wonderful celebration. We deserve it,''
said Miss Getty, who plays the feisty Sophia. ``It's been a

   Tartikoff credited the show for helping boost NBC to the top of
the ratings during the last four years.
   ``In the fall of 1985 was when NBC went into first place, and in

   Singers Phil Collins and Eartha Kitt were among
the entertainers to help raise money for British comedian
Terry-Thomas, whose Parkinson's disease has left him severely in
need.
   Sunday's five-hour show at the 2,600-seat Theatre Royal raised
more than $100,000, with about half going to Terry-Thomas, said
Jack Douglas, the British actor who helped organize the sold-out
event.
   The rest of the proceeds will be divided between the
London-based Parkinson's Disease Society and the Entertainment
Artist's Benevolent Fund, Douglas said.
   ``Never in my history in show business has there been anything
as big as this,'' said Douglas, who began to organize the gala
three months ago.
   ``When I looked at Terry in his very bare apartment, his food
paid for by the Entertainment Artist's Benevolent Fund, I thought,
`There but for the grace of God go any of us.'''
   In addition to performances from Collins and Kitt, the audience
heard tape-recorded tributes from Dudley Moore, Mickey Rooney and
Lynn Redgrave.
   The 77-year-old comedian, who was born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens
and is famous for his gap-toothed smile, has suffered from the
degenerative disease for a decade.

   Dr. Benjamin Spock, the 86-year-old patriarch of
child-care advice, says parents should relax so their kids can.
   ``Children respond to the tensions in parents, not the tensions
in society,'' the white-bearded physician and child psychiatrist
said Saturday. ``We've got to take the pressure off kids.''
   Spock was in Chicago to open a Field Museum of Natural History
exhibition on families.
   He told parents they should teach their children the spirit of
cooperation.
   Parents also should work toward eliminating grades in school and
try to turn politicians' attention to issues like funding for day
care, schools and health care, said Spock, whose book ``Baby and
Child Care'' has sold 32 million copies since 1945 and has been
translated into 31 languages.

   The Rev. Tom Biatek says he doesn't preach
fire and brimstone sermons. But he does enjoy eating fire.
   ``I don't fit the stereotype of a minister, and I'm very pleased
about that,'' Biatek said. ``I guess I'm just a non-traditional
person in a very traditional role.''
   Biatek, of the United Methodist Church of Clarence, learned how
to be a fire-eater three years ago at the Pacific School of
Religion seminary in Berkeley, Calif.
   Fire-eating was part of a class offered that also included
juggling and story-telling. The story-telling he finds useful in
his sermons, particularly to children, but ``I never got the hang
of juggling.''
   Biatek, 26, minister at the Clarence church since graduating
from the Theological Center seminary in San Anselmo, Calif., has
yet to perform his specialty before his congregation of 193 people.
   ``I've done it for the youth group and the 4-H and for the
Christmas carolers last Christmas, but I haven't done it in church.
I guess I'm afraid that something would go wrong. If something did
go wrong, that would kind of upset the worship service a bit,'' he
said.
   But with Pentecostal Sunday coming up May 14, Biatek may change
his mind.
   ``I might do it then. It's the most appropriate day. It would be
a good thing because that's when Jesus appeared to the disciples
and put the tongues of fire over each of them,'' he said.
   Along with fire-eating, Biatek learned how to do a ``Dragon's
Breath,'' which is exactly what is sounds like: breathing the fire
in from a torch and spitting the flames back out.
   ``I love cheap magic tricks,'' he said, laughing. ``People know
me and they know I've got a good sense of humor. I like to laugh
and I joke around in the worship service.''
   ``This is one way of celebrating life and doing something
unusual,'' he said. ``No, I'm not a fire and brimstone preacher _
that's too guilt-laden. I look at worship in church and what I
preach and the Bible as celebrating life.''
   In college, Biatek said, he took one course per semester ``that
I could just have fun in.'' His transcripts include courses in
astronomy, harmonica playing and white-water rafting.
   ``I want to parachute this year, but my wife is against it,
although I think she's giving in,'' Biatek said. ``My dream is to
be on the Johnny Carson show or to meet David Letterman.''
   Biatek admits fire-eating is ``just one of those odd things.''
   ``But you know what? There were 12 others in my class at that
seminary school who learned how to eat fire. So if they'll just
come forward now.''

<TEXT>
   Military jets flew skimmers, booms, and
beach landing craft into Alaska on Sunday, and commanders issued a
Pacific-wide call for more equipment to fight the nation's worst
oil spill.
   Kodiak, the nation's richest fishing port, prepared for the
onslaught of oil by putting out log booms, but the Coast Guard said
the leading edge of the spill, 60 miles away, retreated a bit and
began breaking up into tar balls and sinking.
   ``That's good news,'' said Bill Lamoreaux, the state's on-scene
coordinator.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef near here March
24, spilling 10.1 million gallons of crude into pristine Prince
William Sound. The oil has spread into the Gulf of Alaska and
fouled some of the many islands in the region.
   On Friday, President Bush said he would send the military to
help with the cleanup. Exxon Corp., which has been accused of
moving too slowly to contain the spill, will continue to provide
materials, manpower and money.
   Also Sunday:
   _A 40-foot gray whale was found dead in an oil-fouled area, but
wildlife experts determined it had died before the spill occurred.
The spill has killed thousands of other animals.
   _Exxon said it was beginning to reimburse fishermen for losses
from the cancellation of the herring season and had paid $250,000
to cover expenses for fishing boats attacking the spill on their
own.
   Coast Guard spokesman Rick Meidt said an Air Force general made
a tour of the area and sent a call to bases around the Pacific to
find out what was available and what the estimated time of arrival
in Valdez would be.
   The Coast Guard's Pacific commander, Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins,
was joining the federal effort. Other experts dispatched by the
Pentagon surveyed the cleanup, and with the help of the military,
cleanup gear poured into Valdez.
   ``C5-A after C5-A is bringing in equipment,'' including
skimmers, more booms and beach landing craft to move people to the
oily shoreline, Meidt said.
   The Navy sent barges outfitted as hotels so that when coastline
cleanup gets under way, workers will be housed near where they are
working.
   The forecast called for continued northeast winds, which will
keep the oil moving toward Kodiak, 300 miles from the accident
site. Kodiak last year produced a fish catch worth $166 million.
   But Meidt said, ``When the helicopters go up, they're seeing
streamers a couple of miles long and slicks that are breaking up at
the edges.''
   Herring boats and Coast Guard cutters were dispatched to speed
the breakup of the spill before it reaches Kodiak. At Seward, on
the edge of a national park, a skimmer stood ready to protect inner
bays and fish hatcheries.
   Three log booms constructed by two Kodiak logging companies were
set in bays, spokeswoman Linda Freed said. Log booms are highly
effective as outer barriers, and standard plastic booms were being
used closer to shore, she said.
   In Cordova, Exxon said it gave the local fishermen's union
$250,000 for expenses to keep boats in the cleanup and said it was
writing checks for losses from the canceled herring season. About
$12 million worth of herring are taken in a typical season, which
typically lasts less than a day at spawning time.
   The state Fish and Game Department said the gray whale was found
off Montague Island more than 75 miles from Bligh Reef, where the
tanker ran aground, and was towed to a cove on Latouche Island.
   An autopsy revealed that the whale, which was bloated and had
flaking skin, ``died long before the oil spill ever occurred,''
said fish and game spokeswoman Sheila Nickerson.
   Officials said 119 dead sea otters have been counted and two
boats are waiting to unload additional dead animals. Hundreds of
dead birds have been counted, including some rare yellow-billed
loons and two eagles.
   Wildlife experts say the toll is really in the thousands,
however, because most dead animals sink in the ocean or remain on
shore.
   Some 17,000 barrels of the 240,000 spilled have been recovered,
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. The
cleanup is removing 1,000 to 1,500 barrels a day. NOAA also
estimated 77,000 barrels have evaporated.

   Christian gunners traded sporadic
artillery fire with Syrian forces and Druse allies around Beirut
today, and an official said a lack of fuel could halt all electric
service to the capital.
   Police said there were no casualty reports from the bombardment,
which defied a cease-fire called Wednesday by the Arab League to
halt the worst civil war fighting in four years.
   The clashes, which broke out March 8, have killed 178 people and
wounded 604, by police count. The fighting also has devastated
power plants, fuel reserve tanks and water pipelines.
   The confrontation exacerbated a political crisis that created
competing Christian and Moslem governments and further split the
army on sectarian lines.
   Gen. Michel Aoun leads the Christian government in addition to
commanding the 20,000-strong Christian army. The Christian forces
are batting an alliance of 7,000 Druse militiamen and Syrian
soldiers. Syria has 40,000 troops in Lebanon, most of them in the
eastern Bekaa Valley.
   Despite the cease-fire, both sides have maintained intermittent
firing and air, sea and land blockades.
   The main power plant at east Beirut's Christian suburb of Zouk
has run out of oil and could stop generating electricity for
greater Beirut ``within hours,'' said Mitri Nammar,
director-general of the Beirut Electricty Authority.
   Syrian and Druse rockets and mortars have hit Zouk beach,
preventing fuel tankers from docking. Power has been cut back to
one hour a day.
   Lebanon's latest political crisis began Sept. 22, when
Parliament could not agree on a successor to President Amin Gemayel
at the end of his six-year term and Gemayel named Aoun to head an
interim government.
   Moslems rejected the appointment and swore allegiance to Salim
Hoss, the Sunni Moslem premier who led the government during
Gemayel's administration.
   Under an unwritten national covenant dating to independence from
France in 1943, Lebanon's president is a Christian, the premier a
Sunni Moslem and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.

<TEXT>
   Greek and U.S. negotiators opened a new
round of talks today on U.S. military bases in Greece, but a
diplomat predicted no quick progress.
   The Greeks seek assurances from U.S. officials that they will
try to solve outstanding differences with neighboring Turkey, a
NATO ally of both countries. Greece also wants to close Hellinikon
Airbase next to Athens International Airport.
   U.S. negotiators say they want to keep the Greek-Turkish issues
outside the current talks. They also say Hellinikon is an integral
part of U.S. operations in Greece. It is used by aircraft to shadow
movements of the Soviet Mediterranean fleet.
   The old pact provided that United States pay Greece indirectly
for the bases with about $500 million in annual military
assistance. The Greeks want the aid increased to $800 million.
   The new talks beginning today at the Foreign Ministry are the
16th round. They are not expected to last longer than three days
and will mainly deal with a preamble to a new agreement.
   Western diplomatic sources believe no agreement will be reached
before scheduled June 18 general elections ``in order to avoid it
becoming a pre-electoral issue,'' one diplomat said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``New ground will have to be broken with the next government,''
said the diplomat.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou, who leads the Panhellenic Socialist
Movement, has said repeatedly any new agreement will be put to a
public referendum for a final decision.
   After the 14th round of talks in Athens two months ago, Greek
government spokesman Sotiris Costopoulos said there were
``differences of opinion between the two sides but no deadlock.''
   Four major U.S. installations are in question: Hellinikon; a
navy communications station in Nea Makri, 20 miles southeast of the
Greek capital; an air force communications installation on the
Aegean island of Crete; and a support base for the 6th fleet, also
on Crete.
   The previous five-year agreement expired last December. That
accord gave the United States 17 months from the expiration date to
either dismantle its bases or sign a new contract.

<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded today outside the home of
a Supreme Court judge, and a leftist terrorist group said it
mounted the attack to pressure judges to reject a U.S. request to
extradite a Palestinian bombing suspect.
   Police said the pre-dawn blast caused no injuries. They said it
did extensive damage at the apartment of Judge Samouil Samouil in
suburban Neo Psychicho and at nearby apartments. It exploded at the
front door of the judge's fifth-floor apartment, the police said.
   There was no immediate word on whether the judge was home at the
time.
   The Greek terrorist group, May 1, claimed responsibility in a
proclamation published in the leftist newspaper Eleftherotypia. The
statement contained threats against Supreme Court members involved
in a decision on extraditing a Palestinan to the United States on
terrorism charges.
   The Supreme Court is scheduled to announce Tuesday whether it
will allow the extradition of Mohammed Rashid, also known as
Mohammed Hamdan.
   ``Our action is a warning and is directed to all members of the
judiciary, irrespective of their position, who are involved in the
Hamdan (Rashid) case, that their protection does not rely on the
police but ... on their decision,'' the May 1 statement said.
   Rashid, whose legal expenses are being paid by the Palestine
Liberation Organization, was arrested at Athens airport last year
following a tip by the U.S. Embassy.
   He is wanted in the United States on charges of placing a bomb
aboard a Pan Am airliner in 1982. One person died in the explosion
over Hawaii.
   The Marxist-oriented May 1 group previously has claimed
responsibility for shooting and wounding Giorgos Raftopoulos, the
president of the General Confederation of Greek Laborers, in 1987
and assassinating Supreme Court Judge Anastasios Vernardos earlier
this year.
   Judicial sources declined to say if Samouil is involved in
Rashid's case. Not all judges of the 48-member Supreme Court are
reviewing the case.

<TEXT>
   The PLO today rejected Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal to hold elections in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying it was a warmed
over version of the Camp David Accords.
   In its first reaction to Shamir's plan, the Palestine Liberation
Organization said any elections in the territories Israel occupied
in the 1967 Middle East war should be held after Israeli withdrawal
and under international supervision.
   The PLO news agency Wafa quoted an unidentified PLO spokesman as
saying Shamir's plan is ``nothing but a reactivation of the
self-autonomy scheme of the Camp David Accord which the PLO and our
entire Palestinian people already have rejected.''
   Shamir unveiled his election ideas in Washington last week as a
way of breaking a deadlock in Middle East peace efforts.
   His plan calls for having Palestinians choose representatives
for negotiations about an interim settlement in the disputed lands.
   The agency called the idea ``nothing but a maneuver aimed at
undermining efforts undertaken by several world powers to achieve a
just settlement in the Middle East.''
   The U.S.-brokered Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel
called for limited autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. The 1978 accords led to peace with Egypt but were
rejected by the PLO.
   ``The only just solution is an Israeli withdrawal from
Palestinian and Arab territory,'' the spokesman said. ``The West
Bank and Gaza Strip should be placed under United Nations
supervision for a transition period, during which Palestinians
could exercise their right to self-determination, including the
holding of free elections.''
   The statement reiterated frequent PLO calls for an international
peace conference on the Middle East involving all parties
concerned, ``including the Palestinian state'' proclaimed by the
PLO National Council on Nov. 15.
   It is the first time the PLO has mentioned the Palestinian state
as the representative of Palestinians at the proposed international
peace conference. All previous references mentioned the PLO.
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli newspaper reported today that Shamir
indicated he might consider allowing Palestinians from outside the
occupied territories to participate in the proposed elections.
   Interviewed by the Maariv daily in Chicago, Shamir was asked
whether Palestinians outside the territories and in annexed east
Jerusalem could vote in his proposed elections. He replied the
question would be ``a subject for discussion.''

   Communist rebels bombed a U.S.
military communications center in northern Benguet province,
destroying an antenna and damaging three electric pylons, officials
said.
   Military officials said there were no injuries from Sunday's
explosion at the station on Mount Cabuyao, 140 miles north of
Manila.
   ``The communication site remains operational,'' said a statement
from the U.S.-run Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila. Maj.
Wayne Crist, a spokesman at the base, said estimates of the damage
were unavailable.
   The complex houses a U.S. Air Force microwave relay station,
which assists communication inside the country, and a U.S. Navy
remote tracking station, Crist said.
   A Philippine Constabulary report said the saboteurs planted 18
explosive devices under an antenna and several electric towers in
the compound but only five went off, destroying the antenna and
three electric pylons.
   ``It is suspected that this is the work of communist terrorists
in the area,'' armed forces chief of staff Gen. Renato de Villa
told a news conference. ``It has been known that the (rebels) are
targeting U.S. installations and personnel.''
   Communist insurgents have waged a 20-year-old rebellion. They
have threatened to attack U.S. facilities unless the United States
stopped supporting President Corazon Aquino's counterinsurgency
campaign.
   Communist guerrillas killed three Americans and a Filipino in
attacks outside Clark in October 1987.

   Communist border guards opened fire as two East
German men attempted to flee over the Berlin Wall to the West
during the weekend, police said.
   The West Berlin police said the men were arrested and led away
from the border fortifications after the escape was thwarted.
   The men did not appear to have been injured, police said.
   ADN, East Germany's state news agency, acknowledged the
incident, but called it ``an act organized and ordered from West
Berlin.''
   ADN said a warning shot was fired by a border guard to prevent
the men from ``illegally crossing the frontier.''
   The four Allied powers in West Berlin condemned the use of force
at the Berlin Wall, calling it a ``serious violation of basic human
rights.''
   East German border troops have used deadly force at least three
times in recent weeks to prevent people escaping over the wall that
divides the city.

<HEAD>U.N. Study Finds Growth in East-West Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East-West trade swelled during the first half of
1988, ending the stagnation that has prevailed since 1984, a U.N.
study said today.
   The annual report compiled by the 34-nation U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe predicts future growth as a result of
Soviet-bloc market-oriented reforms and reduced international
tensions.
   The figures showed the Eastern European satellites shifted trade
away from the Soviet Union and toward the West last year. The
report said that trend is expected to continue in the next few
years.
   ``Sentiment in most Eastern countries appears to have turned
again in favor of greater integration into the world economy,'' the
study said.
   Paced by Poland and Romania, Eastern European exports to the
West rose 7 percent in January-September 1988, the study said.
During that period, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia and East Germany
reversed export declines recorded in 1987.
   Imports from the West continued a slow recovery with 3 percent
growth during the same time. However, Hungary and Romania, in line
with restrictive economic policies, both cut their Western exports
for the second straight year.
   Higher oil sales, mainly re-exports of crude from OPEC
countries, sparked a 13 percent rise in Soviet exports to the West
from January-September 1988, the latest period for which figures
were available. Imports jumped 11 percent after a two-year fall,
with Western grain shipments rising steeply.
   Economic factors cited for the general rise in exports last year
were continued growth in Western countries and trade-stimulating
measures, such as currency devaluations by Poland and Hungary.
   In addition, the price of Soviet oil for Eastern Europe dropped
for the first time in a decade, making the satellites less
dependent on exports to the Soviet Union to pay for crude imports
and opening the way for more exports to the West, the study said.
   Soviet trade with industrialized Western market economies showed
a $2.8 billion deficit last year, according to Western estimates
quoted in the report. Eastern Europe's trade surplus with the West,
meanwhile, rose for the third straight year to an estimated $1.7
billion.
   Meanwhile, economic growth in the planned economies of the
Soviet bloc rose to 4.1 percent in 1988 from 2.6 percent in 1987,
according to official rates.
   The report gave no single overall figure reflecting increased
East-West trade. However, it said Soviet bloc trade with the West
and other parts of the world rose 10 percent last year.
   The study said relaxed international tensions have fostered more
East-West business contacts, and economic reforms have granted
Soviet-bloc enterprises greater autonomy.
   However, the report said it is uncertain whether Eastern Europe
can sustain the high pace of exports to the West due to lagging
technology, inefficiency, and competition from newly
industrializing countries.

<TEXT>
   Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft says an unborn
baby should not have to die because of ``the inconvenience or
desperate circumstances'' of a pregnant woman, so he's asking the
Supreme Court to restrict abortions.
   As Ashcroft made his comments, hundreds of thousands of
pro-choice activists marched on the Capitol on Sunday seeking to
avert a reversal of the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortion.
   The court will hear arguments April 26 on a Missouri statute
that bans abortions and abortion counseling in public facilities
and requires doctors to try to save fetuses aborted after a certain
age of gestation.
   ``Abortion is a topic that relates to death because we lose
about a million-six hundred to million-seven hundred thousand
unborn babies that are killed in the process,'' Ashcroft said on
CBS' ``Face the Nation.''
   He acknowledged that as a result of the law, women who had
abortions might still find themselves with unwanted premature
babies facing physical problems, such as neonatal lung disorders.
   Asked who pays for the care of the child, Ashcroft said, ``I
think that depends.''
   Pressed on whether any state money had been budgeted for the
care of children who survive abortions, he responded, ``The state
is, as a matter of policy, eager to save the lives of as many of
these children as we can, and we're willing to help. Not only in
making sure that the medical needs are met, but making sure that
there are families that take these children.''
   The Republican governor said his state passed the restrictive
abortion statute because ``we hope that any time we can save the
life of a child in Missouri, that we would seek to save the life of
that child. ...
   ``And if the right of an abortion, as it's currently construed,
is to rid the mother of the _ whether it be inconvenience or
desperate circumstances she feels she's in because she's pregnant _
if that doesn't mean the baby has to die, we don't see any reason
for that baby to die.''
   Ashcroft defended the provision of the Missouri statute banning
abortion in public facilities and denied that it discriminated
against poor women.
   ``Many of the poorer people in our state are treated in private
hospitals,'' he said. ``As a matter of fact, the trend is away from
public hospitals, so difficult to administer, and frequently, work
on patients that would ordinarily be in a public hospital are
referred on a contract basis to private hospitals now.''

   Former Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork
says the Earl Warren court is responsible for the continuing
political demonstrations that surround the high court's decisions.
   At a conference commemorating the 20-year anniversary of
Warren's retirement as chief justice, Bork, a former federal
appeals court judge whose nomination to the Supreme Court was
rejected in 1987, said the ``activism'' of the Warren court
``damaged perceptions of the legal system.''
   ``People have vigils around the court, they march up and down
Constitution Avenue. And what that means is that they perceive the
court as essentially a political institution. I think that's
dangerous.''
   He spoke Sunday as hundreds of thousands of abortion-rights
advocates marched in the nation's capital calling for continuation
of legal abortion, which the court is to re-examine April 26.
   Bork did not discuss the abortion issue but referred to the
Warren court's declaration of a constitutional right of privacy,
which because the basis of the Warren Burger court's 1973 ruling
legalizing abortions, as one of the court's ``excesses.''
   Bork's rejection of a constitutional right of privacy was a
central issue in the Senate's rejection of his nomination to the
high court by President Reagan. Bork has since resigned as an
appeals judge and is a speaker on conservative issues and a scholar
at the American Enterprise Institute.
   He took part in a panel discussion, part of a weekend of events
commemorating Warren, an Eisenhower appointee who served on the
Supreme Court from 1953 to 1969 and died in 1974.
   At a dinner Saturday night, Justice William Brennan said Warren,
with whom he served 13 years, will be remembered for ``his concern
with fairness for the disadvantaged, the downtrodden, the poor, the
friendless,'' and for his leadership at a time of ``the greatest
diversity of deeply troublesome questions in our court's history.''
   But Bork, speaking to reporters after his panel appearance, said
the nation would be better off if the Warren court had never
existed.
   ``If I had a court of Byron Whites, judges in that range, I
think the country would be better off because there wouldn't have
been so many excesses,'' he said. White, appointed by President
John F. Kennedy, served in the later years of the Warren court but
dissented from some of its liberal rulings.

   A neighborhood rally sounded a call for
unity to battle the crack cocaine epidemic after weekend shootings
left two dead and 10 injured.
   ``It's time for us to get together,'' said the Rev. Cecil
Williams, who led several hundred chanting people through the
city's Ocean View neighborhood on a march before the Sunday rally.
   The march and rally, during which participants carried signs
that read ``No Hope in Dope'' and ``Jobs Not Drugs,'' followed a
weekend of violent outbreaks in the Bayview-Hunters Point district,
less than two miles away.
   Williams, pastor of the inner-city Glide Memorial United
Methodist Church, called the gathering a first step in the fight
against crack, the smokable form of cocaine that is destroying
families and communities across the nation.
   Organizers called for increased job training and education
programs to give youngsters an alternative to drugs.
   The rally was planned several weeks ago, but a drive-by ambush
and another shooting probably prompted more people to participate,
Williams said.
   ``People are being killed, being openly killed,'' he said.
   Two people were killed and nine injured in an automatic weapons
ambush early Saturday that police said may have been a case of
mistaken identity. In a separate incident Saturday night, two men
were abducted by four others carrying an Uzi machine gun and a
.45-caliber handgun. One of them was shot and wounded.
   The rally participants' inference that the shootings were
drug-related was bolstered by a report in The San Francisco
Examiner on Sunday. It quoted an unidentified young man who said
the attack early Saturday was directed by a crack dealer who
followed what he thought were some gang members as they left an
outdoor party in a nearby park.
   The source said most of the victims had no gang connections and
the crack dealer's main target escaped injury.
   ``Everybody's scared now. It was never like this,'' said JoAnne
Miller, a school board member and a neighbor and acquaintance of
one of those who died.
   Residents on Saturday spray-painted the words ``Why, Why, Why?''
in an intersection near the shootings.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Dissident Leader For Pyongyang Visit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested the leader of South
Korea's largest dissident group today in connection with a secret
visit to communist North Korea by one of the group's advisers.
   Lee Bu-young, co-chairman of the United National Democratic
Movement, was detained when he came out of a downtown Seoul
building where he attended a meeting to arrange a welcome for
dissident clergyman Moon Ik-hwan. The Rev. Moon visited North Korea
on March 25 and met its leader, Kim Il Sung, to discuss reunifying
the peninsula.
   A goverment prosecutor, who declined to be named, said Lee, 46,
may be charged with violating a law banning activity that supports
or helps North Korea.
   Moon visited Pyongyang without the required government approval.
He faces arrest when he returns from Tokyo, where he stopped en
route home.
   Despite the government's announcement that it will arrest him,
Moon said he will arrive in Seoul on Thursday, the day before his
passport expires.
   Prosecution officials said Lee is being questioned about whether
he knew in advance of Moon's trip. They said they also suspect Lee
of aiding an illegal strike that has paralyzed the nation's largest
shipyard for more than three months.
   Lee's arrest appears to be a prelude to a crackdown on the
nation's increasingly militant dissidents, whom officials claim are
bent on ousting the government and replacing it with a
revolutionary administration friendly to Seoul's communist rival.
   Several people, including two of Moon's sons, were arrested last
week. Government officials have indicated many dissident leaders
could be arrested after Moon returns.
   President Roh Tae-woo last week ordered police to intensify
efforts against ``radical leftists.''
   In a nationwide raid on publishing houses and bookstores, police
seized 11,000 books promoting the cause of North Korea and the
communism South Korea's government finds abhorrent.
   Korea was divided in 1945 after World War II. Enmity between the
two countries was heightened by a 1950-53 war after North Korea
invaded South Korea.

   The producer of an educational film on
teen-age suicide accused the state of censorship for ordering him
to surrender all prints of the movie so it can be destroyed.
Officials say the movie, produced at state expense, could actually
encourage suicide.
   Department of Mental Health officials said that Jerry Naylor's
film, ``Give Yourself a Chance for Life,'' contains a graphic
suicide scene that could provoke troubled teen-agers to take their
own lives.
   Naylor, hired by the state to produce the film for $237,000, has
refused to give up the movie, contending it should be shown in
every California high school because it can save lives.
   ``It's censorship, direct censorship,'' Naylor said Friday. ``If
I sincerely believed this film was `a lethal weapon,' as they call
it, or that it would cause one person to kill himself, I'd never
want it shown. I'm not giving up.''
   Dr. Michael O'Connor, director of the Department of Mental
Health, says he too is not giving up.
   ``My mind will never change on that film,'' O'Connor said.
``This is a matter of medical ethics, not artistic content. Medical
and clinical people I've shown the film to unanimously told me they
thought the film was dangerous, that people might get the wrong
idea when they see it.''

<HEAD>Four Nurses Under Arrest Admit To 49 Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four nurses have confessed to killing 49
patients with lethal injections in a Vienna hospital since 1983,
police said today.
   The fourth nurse was arrested Sunday, after three other women
had been arrested Friday and acknowledged killing 44 patients at
Lainz hospital, Police Chief Guenter Boegl said.
   He told reporters that the nurse arrested Sunday acknowledged
killing five patients.
   Boegl said the nurses gave the patients, who reportedly ranged
in age from 75 to 80, overdoses of insulin or a sleeping medication
or forced infusions of water into their lungs.
   The nurses, identified by police as Maria Gruber, 25, Irene
Leidolf, 27, Waltraud Wagner, 30, and Stephanie Mayer, 50, are in
custody, but no formal charges had been filed by this afternoon.
   Police said each nurse knew the others were killing patients.
Investigators said in a few cases two nurses would act together to
administer a lethal injection.
   Initial reports said the killings in Lainz hospital occurred in
the past year, but Boegl said the slayings apparently began in 1983.
   He said no new arrests were planned.
   Boegl said Sunday the nurses gave as their main motive ``active
euthanasia,'' inducing painless death in people suffering from a
painful, terminal disease.
   Another police investigator said the nurses also killed patients
whom they considered a nuisance.
   Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak said in a radio interview it
would be ``difficult for those who work (at the hospital) to
re-establish trust with the patients.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government survey of crime has shown its
second straight annual increase, going up by 1.8 percent in 1988,
after five straight years of decline.
   Car thefts and burglaries jumped at least 9 percent last year to
lead the increase in crimes reported by victims ot the National
Crime Survey, the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics
said Sunday.
   Overall, the number of crimes reported to the survey increased
from 35.3 million in 1987 to 35.9 million, according to the
preliminary results for 1988.
   ``The increase reverses a declining trend that began in 1981,''
said Joseph Besette, acting director of the Bureau of Justice
Statistics. ``Crime rates reached their lowest levels in 1986, when
there were fewer offenses for most categories than at any time
since the National Crime Survey commenced in 1973.''
   Preliminary results for 1988 showed a 1.2 percent increase in
personal crimes, including rape, robbery, assault and theft.
   Household crimes went up 2.6 percent from 1987, the study said.
That included a 9 percent jump in completed break-ins.
   Motor vehicle thefts went up 9.6 percent from 1.4 million to 1.6
million, according to the study. The study also showed a 6 percent
increase in assaults, including a 9.3 percent jump in aggravated
assaults.
   The growth in crime last year may have resulted in part to an
increase in the nation's population, the department said.
   The survey of 99,000 people over age 12 in 49,000 households is
conducted every six months by U.S. Census Bureau representatives to
determine who has become a crime victim. The figures are based on
crimes reported by the victims to the survey, not to police
authorities.
   The survey found a 12.8 percent increase in rapes, but the
result was not considered statistically significant, the Justice
Department said. At the same time there was a 9.3 percent decrease
in rapes reported to police.

   Former congressman Mario Biaggi entered
a federal prison early today to start serving his 2{-year sentence
for accepting a bribe.
   Biaggi, 71, reported to the U.S. Correctional Facility, a
minimum security prison that has about 850 inmates, about 1 a.m.,
said Warden Ron Burkhart.
   He immediately began the check-in process, was given
institutional clothing and assigned a place to live, Burkhart said.
After a physical examination and several days of orientation,
Biaggi will be assigned a job at the facility.
   ``Everybody does something that is reflective of his abilities
or restrictions,'' Burkhart said.
   Biaggi arrived at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport late
Sunday on a flight from Newark, N.J.
   He parlayed a record as the most highly decorated police officer
in New York City history into a successful political career,
winning election to the House of Representatives 10 times.
   But in September 1987, he was convicted of federal bribery
charges in for accepting a Florida spa vacation from former New
York City Democratic boss Meade Esposito.
   He was later convicted in the Wedtech scandal and sentenced to
eight years.
   At the New Jersey airport, Biaggi said he had served his
constituents well and would return ``to pick up where we left off.''
   Flanked by family members, he told reporters he went to church
earlier in the day. He also said he visited his wife, Marie Wassil
Biaggi, who is hospitalized with Hodgkin's disease.
   ``I have loving grandchildren and loving children,'' he said.
``They'll be here when I get back.''
   The former congressman maintained he accepted the Florida
vacation as a friend of Esposito.
   ``I find myself going to a federal facility today because a
friend of some 35 years was generous to me,'' said Biaggi.
   About 30 friends gathered at a posh New York City restaurant
Saturday for a combination farewell party for him and birthday
party for the daughter of a long-time friend.
   ``They gave me a great honor,'' said Biaggi. ``I believe I
served them well. I tried with all of my might. I'm leaving, but
I'll be back and we'll pick it up where we left off.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril's military
government worked today to restore its authority after crushing a
revolt by army units in two days of fierce fighting.
   The government appeared to be firmly in control after the
rebellion, which followed a failed military coup eight days ago.
Shops, offices and schools were open and traffic was back to normal
in Port-au-Prince, this Caribbean nation's capital of 1 million
people.
   Government communiques released late Sunday lifted news
censorship and eased an overnight curfew.
   Only sporadic shooting was heard in Port-au-Prince overnight,
and one body was found in a street early today.
   The government released no information about the number of
casualties during the weeklong revolt or the fate of rebels
captured during the final assault Saturday by Avril's Presidential
Guard on the mutineers' stronghold.
   However, Roman Catholic Radio Soleil said today that 30 soldiers
_ 25 rebels and five loyalists _ and four civilians were killed
Friday and Saturday in fighting with cannons, mortars, grenades,
rifles and machine guns. A Haitian doctor speaking on condition of
anonymity said at least 15 soldiers of the Presidential Guard were
wounded but he had no report on injured rebels.
   A military communique issued at 5:15 p.m. Saturday said loyal
troops had seized the Dessalines Barracks compound adjoining the
National Palace and most of the rebels were captured but a few fled.
   It blamed the revolt, which began April 2 with a failed coup
attempt, on people it said were opposed to the government's ``vast
campaign against drug trafficking, contraband and corruption.''
   Four ranking officers were accused of plotting the coup and
three were deported last week to the United States. The fourth,
Col. Guy Francois, commander of the Dessalines Barracks, received
asylum in the Vatican Embassy, according to Radio Soleil.
   Avril's seven-month-old government has been under pressure from
the United States to act against narcotics trafficking and those
military officers reportedly profiting from it.
   Washington has made action against the trafficking a condition
for restoring $70 million in aid that was suspended in November
1987 after bands of thugs killed 34 people and brought the
cancellation of elections.
   The balloting would have been Haiti's first free elections in 30
years. It was scheduled after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to
France in February 1986 during violent demonstrations.
   Avril was installed as president in September after a coup led
by non-commissioned officers and established the island's fourth
government since 1968. He has promised democratic elections.
   Two of the army's strongest military units, the Dessalines
Barracks with 750 troopers and the Leopards Battalion on the
outskirts of the capital with 400 soldiers, rebelled after Avril
deported three alleged leaders of the attempted April 2 coup: Lt.
Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of the Leopards; Presidential Guards
commander Col. Philippe Biamby and Col. Leonce Qualo of army
headquarters.
   But the Presidential Guards, which has 1,100 soldiers and is the
largest unit in Haiti's 7,000-man army, remained loyal.
   Soldiers of the Leopards Battalion revolted after the failed
coup, demanding the release of their commander. There have been
conflicting reports about the death toll in fighting earlier in the
week with at least six Leopards killed.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said Sunday the United
States had donated $25,000 to the Haitian Red Cross for medical
assistance.

   Abortion rights activists lobbied on Capitol
Hill today as their leaders predicted that the massive turnout for
their march will leave a strong impression on the Supreme Court.
   ``Nobody in public office isn't affected by a huge outpouring,''
said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women.
   Hundreds of activists who took part in Sunday's march got some
quick lessons in congressional lobbying and then made their way to
the offices of their local representative or senator to press their
case.
   Wearing buttons with the words, ``Be a Voice for Choice'' or
``Catholics for a Free Choice,'' activists thanked the 140
lawmakers who had signed a friend-of-the-court brief in the
Missouri case now pending before the Supreme Court and urged others
to support abortion-rights legislation.
   ``The notion is for as many people as possible to see senators
or congressmen,'' Bill Hamilton, a Washington, D.C., lobbyist for
Planned Parenthood, told activists from New York and Rhode Island.
   Although the matter is up to the court, Yard defended the
congressional lobbying effort, noting that members of Congress and
the Bush administration speak to the nine justices on the court.
   At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said,
``Everyone has the right to march and present their views. It
appears that it was a very successful march over the weekend in
terms of the number of people they wanted to get here. They
presented their views very effectively and that's good.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, however, said the march was ``nothing
unusual in this town.''
   ``I don't believe the Supreme Court, should be, nor do we expect
it to be, swayed by a demonstration. That is not the way the system
is supposed to work. They are there to render a legal opinion,''
Quayle said.
   The ``March for Women's Equality, Women's Lives'' attracted
hundreds of thousands of men and women, Democrats and Republicans,
Hollywood stars and everyday people who converged on the Capitol
for speeches, songs and declarations that women will never again
return to the days of illegal abortions in back alleys.
   While law enforcement authorities estimated the rally crowd at
300,000, Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist
Majority, said the turnout was more than 600,000.
   Either way, the turnout was higher than the 90,000 people who
gathered for a March 1986 abortion rights rally in Washington and
the numbers that the rally's organizers had predicted.
   ``It's a turning point. It's a totally new ball game,'' Smeal
said. ``It's given us the confidence that we are the majority.''
   Claiming newfound political clout, abortion rights activists are
meeting today with members of Congress to lobby aggressively for
support of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
   Their main focus, however, is the Supreme Court, which will hear
arguments April 26 in a Missouri case that pro-choice and
anti-abortion forces agree could significantly alter the ruling
that gave women the right to an abortion.
   ``I don't think they can miss this huge outpouring,'' Yard said
of the court.
   College students by the busloads, mothers with babies in tow,
members of Congress and even activists from as far away as
Australia marched down Constitution Avenue, chanting ``Choice,
Choice, Choice,'' or ``Not the church, not the state, women must
decide our fate.''
   They carried purple, white and yellow banners _ colors of the
women's suffrage movement _ that said ``Members of Congress for
Choice,'' ``Brooklyn Women's Political Caucus,'' and the names of
various other groups in attendance.
   Emerging from anonymity was Norma McCorvey, better known as the
Jane Roe of the Roe vs. Wade decision. The Texas woman, who only
recently has given speeches to small audiences and was visibly
shaken by reporters' questions, said she attended the rally because
``our law's in jeopardy.''
   Some of the marchers wore coat hangers on their clothing or
their heads, a reference to the often deadly self-abortion
technique used before the procedure was legalized.
   ``We said people would turn out if they thought anything could
happen to Roe vs. Wade. And they did,'' Yard said.
   At the start of the march, the abortion rights activists
exchanged taunts with about 200 to 300 anti-abortion demonstrators
along the march route. The group was held back by police on
horseback.
   The anti-abortion activists set up a symbolic ``Cemetery of the
Innocents'' on the Washington Mall containing 4,400 white wooden
crosses and Stars of David. According to organizers, the number
represents the unborn children killed daily since the Supreme Court
legalized abortion.
   Participants in the abortion rights rally said they were there
because they fear a reversal of Roe vs. Wade.
   ``We're scared,'' said Ellen Davidson, a Yale University junior
from Hewlett, N.Y., because ``we're coming to the realization that
the thing we've taken for granted can be taken away.''
   Gloria Steinem, a pioneer in the women's rights movement,
likened the ``fundamental question of reproductive freedom'' to
freedom of speech.
   ``If we go back before where we were in 1973, it's exactly like
saying freedom of speech is up to state legislatures,'' Steinem
said.

<HEAD>Colonel Steps Down Because of West Bank Actions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron
has forced a colonel to resign after investigations of attacks on
Palestinians by soldiers under his command, a military source said
today.
   The Maariv daily said it was the harshest action taken in more
than a decade against an officer of such a high rank serving in the
occupied territories.
   The military source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Col. Yuhuda Meir decided to step down and leave the army after
Shomron told him he must either quit or stand trial.
   Meir, who was military governor of Nablus in the occupied West
Bank at the start of the 16-month Palestinian uprising, was
investigated in connection with two incidents.
   One of these was a widely reported case in Kfar Salem near
Nablus last year where troops under Meir's command used a bulldozer
to bury four Palestinians under piles of sand, the newspaper said.
The victims survived.
   Another inquiry involved the beatings of two Palestinian
teen-agers in Nablus, one of them with a stone. The attack was
filmed by American television cameras. Those youths also survived.
   Meir was removed from his Nablus post following these incidents
and reassigned elsewhere, the military source said. He was later
investigated on suspicion of ``inappropriate behavior'' for these
actions, prompting Shomron's action, the source added.
   Maariv said the last high-ranking officer to step down over
actions in the territories was a brigadier general removed by
then-Defense Minister Ezer Weizman after tear gas was fired at a
school in the West Bank town of Beit Jallah in May 1978.

   Soldiers today fired into the air to break up an
rally at a university in Soviet Georgia, witnesses said, one day
after a battle between troops and pro-independence protesters
claimed a reported 18 lives.
   A general strike shut down some stores, factories and mass
transit, and residents of the southern republic donned black
ribbons in a sign of mourning and protest, residents said.
   Protests went on despite official calls for calm, a ban on
public gatherings, the imposition of a curfew and patrols by
soldiers and tanks in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi.
   The ruling Politburo sent Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, a Georgian who once headed the Communist Party leader
in the republic, and party personnel chief Georgy P. Razumvosky to
Tbilisi to oversee efforts to restore calm, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said.
   About 1,000 people ignored the ban on public gatherings and met
at Tbilisi State University at midday to ``to inform each other
about what was going on and decide what to do next,'' Zurab
Zhankarashvili, a member of the Helsinki Watch group, said by
telephone.
   ``The military stood there with their tanks and frightened the
people off. They shot in the air,'' said Zhankarashvili, who was at
the gathering.
   He said soldiers beat two university students.
   Sergei Dandurov, an activist who also attended the meeting,
confirmed that troops fired into the air and said the gathering
lasted about 30 minutes.
   On Sunday, club-swinging troops charged a crowd of about 10,000
people that jammed Lenin Square and protesters used flagpoles,
stones and other objects to defend themselves, witnesses said.
   Official reports said 16 were killed and more than 100 injured
Sunday. Nurse Nana Byelovami of the Central Republic Hospital today
reported two more deaths: A 23-year-old pregnant woman who was
beaten and a 50-year-old woman who inhaled tear gas.
   Gerasimov said today 16 civilians _ 10 women and six men _ were
killed, and that all had been trampled. Tuesday was declared an
official day of mourning, he said.
   However, Zhankarashvili said 50 people were killed on Sunday and
560 injured. His report could not be confirmed independently.
   Tension has been building in Georgia since Tuesday, when
thousands of hunger strikers and protesters began pressing demands
for independence. Georgian nationalists contend the
Russian-dominated Kremlin has encroached on their culture,
language, politics and economy.
   Others rallied to protest calls by some residents of a region in
Georgia, Abkhazia, to secede from the republic because of alleged
discrimination by Georgians against ethnic Abkhazians.
   Taking advantage of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
openness, several of the country's more than 100 ethnic groups are
venting pent-up complaints of discrimination and official
insensitivity to local needs.
   In an attempt to prevent future unrest, the central government
on Saturday issued a decree making insulting or discrediting the
government punishable by up to three years and fines.
   The official Tass news agency said the decree also prohibits
appeals to kindling ethnic tensions and racial hostility and
appeals to commit treason.
   Georgia is the third southern Soviet republic where authorities
have in the past year used troops to quell ethnic disturbances. In
November, troops and tanks were sent to Armenia and Azerbaijan,
where more than 90 people had died in ethnic violence.
   Independence activists called a general strike today to protest
Sunday's killings, but it was unclear if there was full compliance
in Tbilisi, a city of 1.2 million people about 1,100 miles
southeast of Moscow.
   ``No one is going to work,'' said Nokri Dzhangarashvili, a
student.
   ``Everyone but doctors and breadmakers are on strike,'' said a
visitor at the central hospital who refused to give his name.
``There is no transport. All stores are closed except food stores.
Factories are closed.''
   Gerasimov said most businesses were working but that some opened
late because young people disrupted public transport and delayed
people going to work. He confirmed that colleges were closed
because of the strike.
   Police arrested at least six prominent Georgian activists during
the weekend and had a list of 30 others they were seeking, said
Nanuli Gogua, whose daughter Irina Sarishvili was among those taken
into custody by the KGB.
   The Foreign Ministry said that Tbilisi was closed to foreign
correspondents as well as any Soviets reporting for Western news
organizations.
   Authorities imposed an 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew on Sunday after the
violence.
   Tass said the soldiers followed orders not to use their weapons
Sunday but that ``extremists'' resisted with rocks, sticks and
pieces of metal and that ``their actions caused a crush in the
crowd and as a result, 16 people died.''
   Tass said the 100 people injured included 75 soldiers and
policemen.

   A short circuit apparently started a fire on a
Soviet nuclear submarine, causing several explosions that may have
cracked the hull and sunk the ship, the government newspaper
Izvestia said today.
   Tass reported two torpedoes armed with nuclear warheads were
aboard the nuclear-powered submarine that sank in the Norweigan sea
Friday and killed 42 of the 69 sailors aboard. The official news
agency said there was no threat of radiation contamination.
   Izvestia's report today, quoting an investigation under way at
Northern Fleet headquarters in the Arctic port of Murmansk, said:
``According to preliminary information, the fire started because of
a short circuit.''
   The newspaper quoted Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov as saying
that after fighting the fire for two or three hours the crew heard
several explosions.
   ``It is possible that the hull was cracked in a series of
places,'' Izvestia said.
   The explosions may have occurred in seven pieces of ``special
equipment,'' Izvestia said. It did not further identify them.
   The ship's log was saved and investigators are going over it to
determine what happened, the newspaper said. Crews had determined
the exact location of the submarine, it said.
   The newspaper report shed some light on the fate of the crew.
Soviet media said previously that 42 of the submarine's 69 crew,
including the captain, died. A Soviet ship rescued the others and
took them to a hospital in Murmansk.
   Izvestia said four sailors went down with the submarine, and
that two of those who were pulled from the icy water died later.
   Rescue teams found only 19 bodies, it said.
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry reiterated previous Soviet
reports that there was no danger of a radiation leak. The spokesman
added no decision had been made yet whether it was possible to
raise the submarine, which sank more than 4,500 feet in waters
about 310 miles west of Tromsoe on Norway's west coast.
   ``The question of lifting the submarine up has not been decided
yet,'' spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters.
   The official news agency Tass said today that investigators had
found no fault with the effort to extinguish the fire. ``According
to the opinion of the government commission created to investigate
this tragic event, the crew of the submarine acted bravely and
intelligently,'' Tass said.
   U.S. officials have said the vessel, one of the Soviets' most
advanced, was capable of carrying more than a dozen long-range
missiles in addition to the torpedoes.
   The Soviets officially informed Norway of the accident nearly
nine hours after the vessel sank. The Norwegian news agency NTB
claimed Norwegian rescue helicopters could have reached the ship
several hours before Soviet fishing vessels if the Soviets had
asked for help promptly.
   In Oslo, Norway prepared a list of 10 questions for the Soviet
Union about the construction and safeguards of the reactors aboard
the submarine.
   ``We are not trying to pry into their military secrets, but we
are concerned about other circumstances of safety,'' said Norwegian
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Sigrid Romundset.
   Tass said the ship was armed with two nuclear-tipped torpedoes,
but they were designed against radiation leaks even under the
intense pressure of deep water.
   Friday's sinking came five months after a reported near-meltdown
in a nuclear reactor aboard a Soviet icebreaker in Murmansk.
According to the newspaper Vodny Transport, a worker drained
cooling water from an operating reactor rather than one that was
shut down for repairs.
   Had the water drained 30 minutes longer, a meltdown releasing
radiation into the air over the city of 440,000 would have
occurred, the newspaper said. In October 1986, three sailors died
in a fire and explosion aboard a Soviet nuclear-powered submarine
in the Atlantic Ocean. That vessel was armed with ballistic
missiles.

   Independent historian Roy Medvedev won a runoff
election for a new Soviet congress, and the Academy of Sciences
restored Andrei D. Sakharov to the ballot for separate elections to
the chamber, official reports said today.
   The balloting around the nation Sunday was the second stage of
the Soviet Union's first multicandidate national elections in 71
years.
   In the first round March 26, voters rejected at least 45
government and Communist Party leaders in their bids for seats in
the new Congress of People's Deputies.
   The official news agency Tass said Sakharov, the human rights
activist who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, was among those
nominated during a meeting of the Academy of Sciences.
   Tass said 168 members were proposed as candidates for 12 seats
still available from the academy and that today's session had
whittled that number down to 28, including Sakharov and space
scientist Roald Sagdeev.
   The nominees will be presented to academy membership for
balloting on April 19-21 to choose the 12 deputies, Tass said.
   Of 2,250 seats in the congress, 750 were assigned to the
Communist Party and its affiliates as well as social and
professional organizations like the Academy of Sciences.
   Sakharov was previously proposed as a candidate, but an
electoral commission cut him and other well-known reformers from
the final list in favor of old-guard academy managers. Sakharov
supporters successfully blocked about two-thirds of that slate and
forced a second election.
   Historian Medvedev, unlike Sakharov, ran in one of the 1,500
geographical electoral districts.
   Medvedev, whose studies of Stalinism were unpublishable in the
Soviet Union until recently, won 52.3 percent of the vote Sunday in
his race in Moscow's Voroshilov district against Ksenya Razumova,
head of an atomic research laboratory, district election officials
said.
   The official Tass news agency said writer Yuri Chernichenko also
won election in his race against philosophy professor Gennady K.
Ashin in another Moscow district. It did not give figures.
   Chernichenko was a supporter of former Moscow Communist Party
boss Boris N. Yeltsin's successful maverick candidacy and ran on a
platform urging wide-ranging agricultural reform. At an election
rally a week before the election, he said the Soviet Union must
turn from an importer to an exporter of grain.
   Tass said 67.1 percent of the voters took part in balloting in
Moscow, far below the level of about 90 percent who participated
March 26 in the first contested national elections in the Soviet
Union in 71 years.
   Among the other winners Sunday were Yuri Skokov, director of the
Kvant scientific conglomerate, who defeated Pyotr Surov in a third
Moscow district.
   The elections in eight Moscow districts were among 64 run-off
elections held Sunday throughout the country where more than two
candidates had run March 26 and no one received a majority.
   Tass said new elections would be held in 199 of the districts on
May 14. In 195 of them, only one or two candidates ran, but no one
received a majority.
   Among those who lost in uncontested races in the initial
balloting were candidate Politburo member Yuri Solovyev in
Leningrad and a host of top party officials in Moscow, Leningrad,
Kiev and other big cities. More than half the voters in those races
voted ``no.''

   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's trip to
East Germany has been postponed so he can oversee efforts to
restore calm in the Soviet republic of Georgia, the Foreign
Ministry said today.
   Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the ruling
Politburo sent Shevardnadze and Communist Party personnel chief
Georgy P. Razumvosky to the republic following a bloody battle
between soldiers and pro-independence demonstrators.
   Shevardnadze had been scheduled to travel to East Germany on
Wednesday for a brief visit, but Gerasimov said that trip was
delayed.
   As Communist Party leader in Georgia in 1978, Shevardnadze
halted ethnic protests. He is a native Georgian.
   Shevardnadze was named foreign minister in 1985 by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.

<HEAD>Critical Time for Winter Wheat Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a month or less, farmers, traders and
federal planners will know a lot more about 1989 wheat prospects
than they do now, says Carl Schwensen, executive vice president of
the National Association of Wheat Growers.
   The fate of the Kansas crop will be clearer, along with a few
other trouble spots where dry weather has hurt winter wheat
prospects since planting time last fall.
   Also, he says, farmers who plant spring wheat in the northern
plains will be busy the next few weeks with this year's crop.
Producers in the Dakotas, for example, were hit hard by the 1988
drought and are hoping to bounce back this year.
   But Schwensen admitted in a telephone interview last week that
``these are sensitive times'' for wheat farmers. By and large,
winter wheat producers last year escaped the drought ravages that
crippled spring wheat, feed grains and soybeans.
   Winter wheat, since it was planted last fall, is the first of
the major field crops to be harvested. As such, it always draws the
most attention at this time of year.
   The Agriculture Department will issue its first official
estimate of 1989 winter wheat output on May 11. Spring wheat, along
with corn, soybeans, cotton and others planted this spring, won't
be estimated officially by USDA until Aug. 10.
   However, USDA and private forecasters always issue
``projections'' of crop yields, based on historical trends,
assumptions of normal weather patterns and prevailing conditions.
   The USDA projections, some of them not yet endorsed as official,
so far have shown the total U.S. wheat crop in 1989 may range from
around 2.3 billion bushels to 2.45 billion.
   In either case, that would be up sharply from last year's
drought-smitten 1.81 billion bushel _ but still short of expected
use in the wheat marketing year that will begin on June 1. The
increase would be due to a boost in plantings and improved yields
per acre.
   Meanwhile, because of reduced supplies, farmers have seen
substantial increases in wheat market prices. Those appear assured
at least until more is known about this year's harvest.
   But federal law decrees that USDA look ahead to next year and
come up with a program that will best suit the interests of
farmers, consumers and taxpayers in general.
   On April 4, the department asked for public comments on how to
fine-tune the wheat program for 1990 production. Perhaps the
biggest decision will be on the size of the acreage reduction
program, or ARP, which must be announced by June 1.
   The ARP involves the amount of crop base acreage wheat farmers
are required to idle in order to be eligible for federal price
supports and related benefits such as ``deficiency'' payments _
direct subsidies paid when market prices are low in relation to a
target price.
   When wheat stockpiles were large _ more than 1.9 billion bushels
carried over into the new crop year on June 1, 1986, for example _
the acreage set-aside requirement was set at 25 percent or more.
   The wheat carryover dropped, however, and by June 1, 1988, was
down to 1.26 billion bushels. The 1987 and 1988 ARP requirement was
27.5 percent, but last May 25 the USDA announced the 1989 set-aside
at 10 percent. As the effects of the drought became better known,
the ARP for 1989 was reviewed again but was kept at 10 percent.
   Federal law says the ARP cannot be set at more than 20 percent
if wheat inventories are less than 1 billion bushels at the
beginning of the new marketing year. Those are expected to be about
534 million bushels on June 1 and about the same a year from now.
   Schwensen said his association in January endorsed continuing
the ARP for 1990 at 10 percent. The Bush administration's budget
proposal sent to Congress asked for a 5 percent ARP for next year's
wheat crop, and some people have urged taking off all restrictions
_ a zero ARP _ in order to replenish U.S. granaries.
   ``I don't think our members would want to see a zero ARP,''
Schwensen said.
   That could trigger larger acreage, greater production, weaker
wheat market prices and greater federal costs, he said.
   ``We need to watch closely what unfolds in the next 10 days to
two weeks out in the plains areas,'' Schwensen said. ``That could
have an effect _ not only on the 1990 wheat acreage _ but on other
program decisions, including the Export Enhancement Program (EEP)
and other things.''
   The EEP provides federal export subsidies for certain
commodities to selected foreign markets and has been a major factor
in keeping U.S. wheat exports flowing, including large shipments to
China and the Soviet Union.
   According to USDA projections used by planners looking at
possibilities for 1990, the continuation of this year's 10 percent
ARP could mean a wheat harvest next year of about 2.63 billion
bushels, which could mean a modest rise in carryover stocks by June
1, 1991, to 614 million bushels. Farm prices of wheat might average
$3.45 per bushel, down from $3.65 expected this season.
   The 5 percent ARP could mean a harvest of 2.63 billion bushels,
a 1991 carryover of 629 million bushels and a farm price average of
$3.40 per bushel.
   At zero ARP, the 1990 wheat harvest might be 2.75 billion
bushels, a 1991 carryover of 689 million bushels and a price
average of $3.25 per bushel.

   Ernest E. Williams, former editor of the
Fort Wayne News-Sentinel and the man who encouraged Vice President
Dan Quayle to enter politics, has died. He was 72.
   Williams, a key figure in local and state Republican politics,
died Sunday of complications following cardiac bypass surgery.
   ``It was Ernie's idea first that I run for Congress in 1976,''
Quayle told the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette. ``Ernie Williams was a
courageous, honest, independent, hard-driving professional.
   ``He was also a warm and considerate human being who always
thought of other people. He was a close friend and he will be
missed,'' Quayle said.
   Williams, a native of Logansport, Ind., graduated from Indiana
University in 1939. He joined the News-Sentinel as a reporter in
1945 and was named editor in 1966. He retired in October 1982.
   Richard Inskeep, publisher of the Journal-Gazette, said, ``Ernie
was highly regarded in his long-time newspaper career, both as a
reporter and as an editor. This community will miss him.''
   Williams was named coordinator of the journalism program at
Indiana-Purdue at Fort Wayne in 1981. He was inducted into the
Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame at DePauw University in 1988.
   Surviving are his wife, Hildreth E. Williams; two daughters;
three sons; two sisters; a brother; and four grandchildren.
   Funeral services were set for Wednesday.

   The world's fisheries continue to increase
production but have become threatened by overfishing and pollution,
a U.N. official said Monday.
   Edouard Saouma, director general of the Food and Agriculture
Organization, told the opening session of the Rome-based agency's
Committee on Fisheries that world fish demand could exceed 100
million tons by the end of the century.
   Fisheries have increased production steadily from 20 million
tons a year after World War II to more than 90 million tons in
1987, he said.
   Almost all major stocks of bottom-dwelling fish and crustaceans,
such as lobsters and crabs, have been heavily exploited and some
are nearing depletion, he said.
   Aquaculture, which involves raising and harvesting marine plants
and animals, is expected to increase production to about 22 million
tons in the next decade, more than double the 1985 level, the FAO
said.
   Saouma called for better management and stricter monitoring of
fishing resources, adding that the FAO would strengthen its support
for research and development.

   Clashes involving rebels, civilians and

_ including some who were hacked to death with machetes, a
newspaper reported Monday.
   The clashes occured April 4 in a trading town north of the
administrative town of Gulu, 175 miles north of the capital,
Kampala, according to the government newspaper New Vision.
   A group of unidentified rebels, some armed with rifles, first
hacked to death 20 civilians in a village on the outskirts of the
trading town of Lagor, about 35 miles north of Gulu, the newspaper
said, quoting an army officer.
   The rebels then went to an army barracks in nearby Lagor, where
a battle killed 50 rebels and nine soldiers.
   There are at least 10 groups in Uganda fighting President Yoweri
Museveni's 38-month-old government.

   Women hold only 6 percent of top jobs in the
news media and 25 percent of mid-management jobs, according to a
study released today at a conference here on ``Women, Men and
Media.''
   The study, financed primarily by the conference's sponsor, the
Gannett Foundation, also reported that women in the media earn 64
cents for every dollar earned by a man.
   ``Not only are women ignored at jobs in the media, they are
slighted in coverage as well,'' the study said.
   The researchers said they studied photos, bylines and story
sources in 10 newspapers in March and found that 27 percent of the
bylines on the front page were female, 24 percent of the photos
included women, usually with their families; and 11 percent of the
people quoted were female.
   Using this standard, the researchers ranked the newspapers
``from best to worst'' as follows:
   USA Today first; Houston Chronicle and Atlanta Constitution tied
for second; followed in order by the Seattle Times, Washington
Post, Los Angeles Times, Miami Herald, St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
Chicago Tribune and New York Times.
   A study of nightly network newscasts found that from 1975 to
1989 the percentage of female news correspondents increased from
9.9 percent to 15.8 percent, the report said. It said the
percentages of stories filed by women in February were 22.2 percent
on CBS, 14.4 percent on NBC and 10.5 percent on ABC.
   The percentages of stories that focused on women were 13.7
percent on ABC, 10.2 percent on CBS and 8.9 percent on NBC, the
survey found.
   The study of hiring and promotion was conducted by Jean Gaddy
Wilson of the University of Missouri and television and newspaper
coverage was studied by Kathy Bonk, co-director of a communications
consortium, and Junior Bridge.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rough weather continued to break up the
leading edge of the giant, gloppy Exxon Valdez oil spill, the Coast
Guard said today. But the nation's richest fishing port prepared
for the worst by stringing logs across bays.
   On Sunday, U.S. military jets flew skimmers, booms and beach
landing craft into Alaska, and commanders issued a Pacific-wide
call for more equipment to fight the nation's worst oil spill.
   In Kodiak, 300 miles southwest of the spill site, fishermen
covered logs with fish net and spread them across vital fishing
areas Sunday. But officials reported today that the slick seems to
have stalled on its on a southwesterly course for the island, with
high winds making the water so choppy that the blob of oil doesn't
move.
   ``It's not pushing it (oil) to the Kenai Peninsula, and that's
good,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Rick Meidt, referring to the
land mass to the west of the spill and northeast of Kodiak. ``The
weather is breaking up the slick, and that's good.'' In the past
three days, Meidt said, the slick apparently hasn't moved any
further.
   Small craft advisories and a gale warning were posted at Kodiak,
which saw rain, seas to 15 feet and winds from the northeast to 35
knots early today, the National Weather Service said. Winds
decreased toward Valdez, which reported a northeast wind at 10
knots.
   Oil was still at least 60 miles from Kodiak, where officials
even used television to display boom-making techniques.
   Herring boats and Coast Guard cutters were dispatched to speed
the breakup of the spill, whose $166 million catch last year was
the nation's most lucrative. At Seward, on the edge of a
still-threatened national park, a skimmer stood ready to protect
inner bays and fish hatcheries.
   In other developments:
   _U.S. gasoline prices jumped more than a dime a gallon in the
wake of the tanker spill, according to the Lundberg Survey. Prices,
however, were showing signs of easing, said analyst Trilby Lundberg.
   _Exxon said it was beginning to reimburse Cordova fishermen for
losses from the cancellation of the $12 million herring season, and
had paid $250,000 to cover expenses for fishing boats attacking the
spill on their own.
   _The state said the tanker, anchored in a remote cove for
repairs, continues to leak oil, which escapes containment booms
because currents keep shifting the barrier around, snagging it on
the tanker's bow. Today, the Coast Guard said salvage workers have
reinforced punctured areas of the tanker itself to prevent further
fractures.
   The tanker could be seen sitting dead calm with a half-dozen
smaller boats around it. Steam drifted from its stack, a radar arm
rotating and a helicopter on its deck. Long streamers of congealed
oil the color of chocolate milk drifted off for miles.
   _Cleanup crews planned to resume shoreline work on an
experimental basis, testing different pressurized washing systems.
   _Plans to allow a small trawler to harvest shrimp in Prince
William Sound were canceled.
   A 40-foot gray whale was found dead in an oil area Sunday, but
an autopsy revealed that it died long before the oil spill
occurred, said Alaska Department of Fish and Game spokeswoman
Sheila Nickerson.
   Biologists planned to investigate a report of a dead seal south
of Latouche Island to determine what may have killed it, said Karen
Gleason, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   Wildlife experts say spring is a time when many animals are
found dead in Prince William Sound.
   On Friday, President Bush said he would send troops to help the
cleanup, and put the federal government virtually in control of the
effort. Exxon will continue to pay for materials and manpower.
   Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, chief of the Alaskan Air
Command, asked ``bases around the Pacific to find out what was
available and what the ETA (estimated time of arrival) would be for
Valdez,'' Meidt said. Today, the Coast Guard said it was brining in
six more cutters from the West Coast.
   Experts dispatched by the Pentagon began assessing the cleanup,
and more were expected today. With the help of the military,
cleanup gear was pouring into Valdez.
   ``C5-A after C5-A is bringing in equipment'' including 10 Navy
skimmers, 200,000 feet of 7-foot-deep containment boom and even
beach landing craft to move people to the oily shoreline, Meidt
said. The C5-A is the nation's largest cargo plane.
   The Navy also was sending barges outfitted as hotels so that
when coastline cleanup gets under way, workers will be housed
nearby.
   Officials said 119 dead sea otters have been counted and two
boats are waiting to unload additional dead animals. Hundreds of
dead birds have been counted, including some rare yellow-billed
loons and two eagles.
   Wildlife experts say the toll is really in the thousands because
most dead animals sink in water or remain on shore.
   About 18,000 barrels of the 240,000 spilled have been recovered
as of today, officials said. The cleanup is removing 1,000 to 1,500
barrels a day. In addition, some of the oil has evaporated in the
last 2{ weeks.

<TEXT>
   British and Australian soldiers flew to
northern Namibia today and immediately deployed to monitor the
withdrawal of back nationalist guerrillas after fighting
jeopardized a U.N. independence plan.
   The 23 British and 64 Australians soldiers, part of the U.N.
monitoring force, flew from the capital of Windhoek to Grootfontein
town, then drove northward to assembly points and border posts.
   Starting Tuesday, guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's
Organization are to report to the posts and assembly points for the
peacekeepers to escort them back bases in Angola.
   About 1,900 guerrillas nearly derailed a U.N.-sponsored plan to
bring independence to this former German colony when they crossed
the border from Angola and heavy fighting broke out with South
African-led security forces April 1.
   A partially deployed U.N. monitoring force was criticized for
not being able to check the incursions.
   On Sunday, after South Africa reported at least 263 of his
guerrillas were killed, SWAPO President Sam Nujoma ordered the
insurgents to leave Namibia. South African, Cuban and Angolan
officials agreed at a weekend meeting to give the guerrillas until
Saturday to leave with a guarantee of safe passage. U.S. and Soviet
officials observed the meeting at a Namibian game lodge.
   Police reported calm in the northern bush for the second day
Monday, and said they are waiting to see whether the guerrillas
obey orders to leave. The lull follows the fiercest fighting in the
23-year war for this mineral-rich territory, which South Africa has
ruled since World War I.
   Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, the special U.N. envoy in Namibia,
told a news conference no official cease-fire is in effect, ``but
the South Africans have undertaken to restrain their forces.''
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said of the guerrillas
Sunday night: ``If they do not attack, they will not be attacked.''
   At least 263 guerrillas and 28 security force members have been
killed in the fighting, acccording to South African officials.
SWAPO says its losses were much lower and charges nearly one-fifth
of those killed were civilians.
   Ahtisaari said the United Nations will begin flying its flag at
noon Tuesday at two churches south of the Angolan border and at
seven along the border. The assembly points will be expanded to 18.
The information also will be broadcast on the radio, he said
through an aide.
   The agreement was a major concession by South Africa, Ahtisaari
said.
   Botha said the guerrillas who assemble at churches inside
Namibia will have to give their weapons to U.N. forces, who will
then fly them to bases in Angola.
   Guerrillas who travel to churches along the Namibian-Angolan
border will be allowed to keep their arms and the Angolan
government will take responsibility for returning them to their
bases, Botha said.
   South Africa contends SWAPO has sent more than 1,900 guerrillas
into northern Namibia from Angola since April 1 in violation of the
U.N.-sponsored accord, which requires them to remain at bases at
least 100 miles inside Angola until mid-May.
   SWAPO had maintained that the guerrillas were inside Namibia
prior to April and should be allowed to set up bases in the
territory.
   But Nujoma said he decided to pull out his fighters because he
did not want to give South Africa an excuse to cancel Namibia's
independence plans.
   Some U.N. officials have suggested SWAPO field commanders
mistakenly thought their units could return to Namibia beginning
April 1. Several captured guerrillas have said they returned to
Namibia in search of U.N. personnel and expected no confrontations
with security forces.
   The United Nations has authorized a peacekeeping force of 4,650
soldiers for Namibia, but only about 1,000 have arrived.
   SWAPO is favored to win the most votes in pre-independence
elections scheduled for November under the U.N.-sponsored accord.
   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December when
South Africa, Angola and Cuba signed a regional peace plan.
   Cuba agreed to withdraw 50,000 Cuban troops who have helped
Marxist-ruled Angola battle U.S.-backed rebels. In exchange, South
Africa agreed to stop supporting the Angolan rebels and allow
Namibia to become independent.

   Leaders of Britain's Jewish community on Monday
criticized a musical comedy spoofing Adolf Hitler that opens this
month in a London fringe theater to coincide with the 100th
anniversary of the dictator's birth.
   ``The Adolf Hitler Show,'' with actor Brian McDermott in the
title role, gives a camp portrayal of the Nazi leader appearing in
an assortment of swastikas, black stockings and suspenders.
   The show, scheduled to open at the Old Swan Cabaret Bar on April
27, is said to be a loosely based follow-up to the Mel Brooks' film
``The Producers,'' about a madcap impresario putting on a musical
called ``Springtime for Hitler.''
   According to the London Alternative Magazine, playwright David
Parker has written ``a devastating parallel between Britain in the
1980s and Hitler's Germany.''
   But the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which represents
Britain's Jewish community, said the show is ``in very poor taste.''
   Efforts to contact the theater were unsuccessful.

<HEAD>Group Questions NSA Role in Improving Computer Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A public interest group said Monday that the
National Security Agency, the nation's biggest intelligence agency,
could exert excessive control over a program to strengthen the
security of computer systems throughout the federal government.
   The group, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,
urged key members of Congress to focus ``particularly close
scrutiny'' on the NSA's role in helping to implement legislation
aimed at safeguarding sensitive but unclassified information in
federal computers.
   ``There is a constant risk that federal agencies, under the
guise of enhancing computer security, may find their programs _ to
the extent that they rely upon computer systems _ increasingly
under the supervision of the largest and most secretive
intelligence organization in the country,'' it said.
   In a letter sent to Capitol Hill, the group said that ``the
clandestine nature of the NSA, its classified budget, the
difficulty in overseeing its activities, and its aggressive use of
advanced technologies for eavesdropping and encryption and
decryption of communications, raise serious concerns about its
role'' in implementing the Computer Security Act.
   Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, based in Palo
Alto, Calif., describes itself as an organization of computer
scientists and other professionals concerned about the impact of
computer technology on society.
   The letter, signed by Marc Rotenberg, head of the group's
Washington office, was sent to Reps. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.; Doug
Walgren, D-Pa., and Tim Valentine, D-N.C.
   Glickman, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, was one
of the authors of the Computer Security Act. Walgren and Valentine
are chairmen of House Science subcommittees overseeing
computer-related issues.
   Commenting on the letter, Glickman said:
   ``I think there is some legitimate concern about the role of NSA
in computer security issues. ... We need to make certain that they
don't assert power over civilian (computer) records in this
country.''
   Cynthia Beck, a spokeswoman at the NSA's public affairs office,
declined to comment on the letter.
   The NSA, headquartered at Fort Meade, Md., about halfway between
Washington and Baltimore, has a work force topping 60,000 employees
_ more than all other U.S. spy agencies combined _ and a budget
said to be upwards of $10 billion a year.
   Its main missions are eavesdropping on communications around the
world, encrypting U.S. communications and cracking foreign codes,
as well as protecting the security of U.S. military computers and
communications systems.
   Last month, the NSA reached an agreement with the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, a research arm of the
Commerce Department based in suburban Gaithersburg, Md.
   The memorandum of understanding was aimed at facilitating a
program under which the two agencies have started jointly reviewing
thousands of computer security plans submitted by offices
throughout the government.
   In its letter, the computer professionals group noted that
institute lacks the resources to fully implement the computer
security legislation and thus must rely on the NSA for assistance.
   ``This may be a marriage of convenience, but it is not a
marriage between equals,'' it said. ``NSA's resources for this
particular project are, by best estimates, at least 10 times
greater in manpower and budget than those'' of the institute.
   The letter contended that ``Congress must monitor the actions of
the NSA particularly closely. Under the Computer Security Act, the
NSA will have access to information about computer systems
throughout the entire federal government.''
   ``This is an extraordinary amount of information and literally
provides a blueprint for the management of all federal computer
systems,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   The West German government Monday condemned as a
``gross violation'' of human rights a shooting incident at the
Berlin Wall that resulted in the capture of two East Germans trying
to flee to the West.
   ``We are taking this incident very seriously and a protest has
been lodged with the East German government,'' said Reinhard
Schwarzer, a West German government spokesman.
   Witnesses and West Berlin police reported Saturday that two
young men were arrested after an East German border guard opened
fire on them as they tried to flee their communist homeland.
   It was one of three failed escape attempts at the Berlin Wall
this weekend.
   A witness to the shooting said a border guard pulled a pistol
and fired directly at the men, who were running toward the heavily
fortified barrier that divides the city. The men apparently were
not injured.
   East Germany's state-run news agency ADN aknowledged the
incident, but called it ``an act organized and ordered from West
Berlin.''
   The news agency said a warning shot was fired to stop the men
from ``illegally crossing the border.''
   In another incident, West Berlin police said residents early
Sunday observed border troops leading away a man who had tried to
ram through barricades with a truck. Later Sunday, police said
border guards were seen escorting a young man away from the wall at
gunpoint. No shots were fired in either incident, police said.
   The three Allied powers in West Berlin protested the shooting
incident.
   The West German government called the incident ``a gross
violation of human rights and the right to freedom of movement.''
   East German border troops have used deadly force at least three
times in recent weeks to thwart escape attempts. An East German
youth was shot to death while trying to scale border barriers in
March.

   A distraught patient shouting ``I'll
kill you! I'll kill you!''' repeatedly stabbed a psychiatric social
worker at a mental health center, police and the victim said.
   Sunday's attack on Shirley Ann Sauerwein, 44, was the second
knifing in seven weeks at a mental health facility in Santa Monica.
The first one was fatal.
   Ms. Sauerwein was in good condition today at Santa Monica
Hospital Medical Center, where she was expected to remain for
several days for treatment of five wounds in the chest and arms,
said a nursing supervisor.
   A patient, Larry Anthony Taylor, 27, was arrested and held for
investigation of attempted murder in the jail ward at County-USC
Medical Center, said Sgt. Frank Fabrega.
   Ms. Sauerwein said she feels no animosity toward Taylor, who she
said had an irrational fear of an upcoming court hearing on a minor
criminal matter.
   ``Larry is a young man who is immature and in certain instances
cannot practice the best judgment,'' she said from her hospital bed.
   Ms. Sauerwein said she works for the Los Angeles County
Department of Children's Services and part-time at the Santa Monica
clinic.
   She said she had met psychiatric worker Robbyn Panitch, who
police said was stabbed to death Feb. 21 by a transient at another
mental-health facility, the Santa Monica West Mental Health Clinic.
   Ms. Sauerwein said Taylor locked the door before he stabbed her
in her chest and arms.
   ``He kept saying, `I'll kill you! I'll kill you!' Then I said,
`Larry, if you do that, they will send you to jail,''' she said.
She fended off a few more blows, and finally he fled, she said.
Taylor was captured outside the building.
   She said the attack will not make her afraid of returning to her
job, because ``it is something you are trained to anticipate.''
   In an unrelated attack Sunday evening, a mental patient
handcuffed to a gurney at St. John's hospital grabbed the gun of a
police officer guarding him and fired two shots, missing the
officer, said Sgt. Bill Brucker.
   After a scuffle with the officer, David Savarino, 31, of Santa
Monica surrendered. He was jailed for investigation of attempted
murder on a police officer, said Brucker.

<HEAD>EPA Issues Guidelines on Testing Water Fountains for Lead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency today
issued guidelines to school officials on how to test for lead in
water fountains, saying more than a million fountains still being
used in schools have lead components.
   A law enacted last year required the EPA to issued the
guidelines as well as develop a list of what brand and models of
school water coolers have lead components. The law directed a
timetable for eliminating those coolers or correcting the problem.
   Lead is a toxic metal that is harmful to health even at low
levels of exposure. It can cause damage to the brain and nervous
system and lead to learning disabilities, hearing impairment, and
interference in the formation of red blood cells, according to the
EPA.
   Mike Cook, director of the EPA office that deals with drinking
water contamination, said lead in school drinking fountains is only
one of many sources from which children may be exposed to lead.
   A greater source of lead in drinking water often is the pipe
systems that carry the water.
   Nevertheless, the EPA said three manufacturers of drinking
fountain coolers in schools have estimated that more than 1 million
coolers in use contain some lead components. Two other
manufacturers did not respond and another said it made no coolers
with lead components, said Cook.
   The EPA issued more than 100 model numbers of fountain coolers
that have been found to contain lead components. The agency also
made public six models of coolers still in use that have tanks that
are lined with lead. Cook said he had no estimate how many coolers
were manufactured with lead-lined tanks.
   Young children are of particular risk from lead even with only
short-term exposure. According to the EPA, lead in drinking water
typically accounts for about 20 percent of the total lead exposure
in young children.
   Cook said the EPA considers a lead level of 20 parts per billion
in water to pose health risks. While the agency gave no levels for
all the coolers cited in today's announcement, it said that in some
coolers that had lead-lined tanks the levels were more than several
hundred parts per billion.
   ``We've found very high levels of lead in these (lead-lined)
tanks,'' Cook told reporters.
   He said the coolers found to have lead components are only a
``small fraction'' of the total number of coolers used by schools,
although the EPA has no solid figures on how many coolers are
actually in use nationwide.

   Three teams of American experts will travel to
Hanoi later this week for 2{ weeks of investigative work searching
for U.S. servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, the Pentagon said
Monday.
   In addition, the Vietnamese government has informed the United
States it intends ``to repatriate 21 remains, which may be those of
Americans, on April 27,'' the Pentagon said in a statement.
   The investigative teams will arrive in Hanoi on Wednesday for
what will be the fifth such joint mission working with Vietnamese
officials in the field.
   The three teams _ two comprised of investigators and one
consisting of forensic scientists _ have been told they can remain
in the country until April 30, making this the longest such mission
ever, the Pentagon added.
   Previous U.S.-Vietnamese field missions were limited to 10 days
each.
   The teams concentrate their efforts primarily on investigating
geographic areas near the last known position of so-called
``discrepancy'' cases. A discrepancy case is one in which the U.S.
government has reason to believe an American serviceman survived an
airplane crash or hostile fire.
   The joint teams also attempt to investigate live-sighting
reports and other claims about the fate of missing servicemen.
   The Pentagon said the three teams participating in this month's
work would consist of a total of 10 individuals. A separate team of
Americans will fly to Hanoi on April 27 to take possession of the
remains that Vietnam has said it will turn over then.
   According to the Pentagon, there are still 2,370 American
servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, including 1,736 in either
North or South Vietnam. In addition, 545 are listed as missing in
Laos, 83 in Cambodia and six in China.
   The Pentagon said most of the investigative work planned this
month would be concentrated in what used to be South Vietnam, in
and around the area of Danang.

   Two Agriculture Department scientists said
today that a natural yeast found in the stomach of a beetle can
neutralize deadly farm chemicals and natural toxins that sometimes
are found in the nation's food supply.
   Entomologists Patrick F. Dowd and Samuel K. Shen of the
department's Agricultural Research Service said that if the
preliminary tests are borne out in further experiments, the yeast
could be used to remove potentially harmful toxins from livestock
feed and to clean up the environment.
   ``Although we're not yet sure of its full range of detoxifying
ability, the implication we see here is for the environmental
cleanup situations, like toxic waste dumps,'' Shen said.
   If the yeast can be developed properly, it could be
mass-produced to detoxify a wide variety of plant and chemical
toxins in the environment, he said in a report issued here by the
USDA agency.
   Shen spoke Monday at a meeting of the American Chemical Society
in Dallas, Texas. He and Dowd, along with geneticist Nancy J.
Alexander, are working on the project at the agency's northern
regional research center in Peoria, Ill.
   The yeast is found naturally in the stomach of the cigarette
beetle, a pest of stored tobacco, spices and other products. The
yeast provides the insect with vitamins and nutrients, and it
neutralizes certain toxins. This enables the insect to feed on a
wider range of plant materials.
   In laboratory tests, the researchers found that the yeast's
enzymes acted on a variety of compounds, including the insecticides
parathion and carbaryl; phytic acid, which can make some seed meals
unfit as livestock feed; and a ``precursor of aflatoxin,'' a fungal
toxin suspected of being carcinogenic.
   The scientists plan to text the yeast against aflatoxin itself.
Some of last year's drought-damaged corn crop has had high levels
of aflatoxin, a naturally occuring carcinogen.
   A number of microorganisms are already used to a limited extent
to clean water systems and soil, Shen said. But unlike those, the
yeast could be used for multiple cleanup tasks.
   Dowd, Shen's colleague, said that one of the limitations of the
yeast is that it is a slow-growing microorganism.
   ``To successfully produce this thing, we need to find a
faster-growing strain or a way to genetically transfer its
detoxifying ability to a faster-growing yeast,'' Dowd said.

<HEAD>Commissioner Defends Agency's Plan to Use 800 Number</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Social Security Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy
on Monday defended the agency's plan to use a nationwide 800
telephone number to do most of its business with the public and
said people will be able to get through with one call 95 percent of
the time by next fall.
   She testified before the Senate Special Committee on Aging,
whose members received complaints from constituents during January
and February when the new system was flooded with calls.
   The General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress, said the
``busy rate'' jumped to 43 percent in January and was 35 percent in
February, due largely to material mailed to 36 million beneficaries
promoting use of the 800 number.
   However, the GAO said that high busy rate compared with a 17
percent ``busy'' average over the preceeding three months and a 9
percent rate _ lowest ever _ in March.
   Hardy told the panel the agency is working on the assumption
that there is a 15 percent chance a caller will get a busy signal
on the first call now and that the goal is to reduce that to 5
percent by Oct. 1 when the system is fully installed.
   It covers about 60 percent of the nation now and, when fully
installed, will feature the ability for calls to be channeled from
more busy phone centers to less busy phone centers.
   The number is the main current listing for Social Security in
areas of the nation where it is in service.
   Hardy told the committee that, with 120 million American adults
directly affected by Social Security, there will always be isolated
examples of callers encountering troubles.
   She noted that the agency has handled 22 million calls since it
started putting the 800 number system in place six months ago in
what Hardy said was the public's increasing preference to do
business by telephone when possible.
   Live operators are available from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday
through Friday to answer questions and provide basic services such
as mailing forms. Recorded messages are available nights and
weekends to provide basic information, process some actions and
take messages for callback the next business day.
   Hardy said operators schedule appointments at the nearest Social
Security office for callers who need face-to-face service.
   ``The American people want to deal with us by telephone,'' said
Hardy. ``This program was not done to cut costs, but to provide
better service.''
   The nationwide telephone system is part of the so-called Project
2000 long-range Social Security management strategy developed by
Hardy and praised recently by the House Ways and Means subcommittee
that has primary oversight responsibility over the Social Security
Administration.
   The House and Senate aging committees have no direct
jurisdiction over Social Security but typically serve as a conduit
for beneficaries upset with what they believe to be inadequate
service from the program.

   Oliver North testified at his trial today that
former President Reagan and then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III
concealed U.S. involvement in a possibly illegal 1985 arms shipment
to Iran.
   The former White House aide said that in a meeting on Nov. 12,
1986, ``clearly the president ... had made a decision not to
disclose'' the November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel
to Iran.
   At a news conference on Nov. 19 _ a week after that meeting _
Reagan said ``there were no other shipments which the United States
condoned'' besides the ones in 1986.
   Concluding three days of questioning by his own lawyers, North
also testified today that he assumed Reagan had known of the
diversion of Iran arms sale funds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   North said he had the approval of his boss, then-national
secutiry adviser John Poindexter, for the diversion and ``I
believed that I had it from the president of the United States.''
   When the attorney general announced on Nov. 25, 1986 that a
criminal investigation would be undertaken, ``I was shocked. It was
probably one of the most shocking things I had ever heard,'' North
testified.
   He recalled that in meeting with Meese two days earlier, he
supplied details about the November 1985 shipment, which was
assisted by the CIA. Reagan in December 1985 signed a presidential
finding approving the U.S. role after the fact. North said he told
Meese that ``we ought to stand up and acknowledge this'' shipment.
   Two days after North met with Meese, the attorney general told a
nationally televised news conference that the Israelis had made the
1985 shipment without U.S. involvement.
   Meese gave ``a whole series of answers'' that were
``inconsistent with what I had told him'' two days previously, said
North.
   ``It made me wonder whether I had talked to the attorney
general'' two days earlier, said North.
   At his Nov. 25, 1986 news conference, Meese said that ``all of
these transactions that I am referring to took place between
January of 1986 and the present time.''
   Meese said further that Reagan ``later learned in February of
1986 details about another shipment that had taken place in
November of '85.''
   North said Iran was ``very outraged'' about the November 1985
shipment. Out of concern for the safety of U.S. hostages held in
Lebanon, the Reagan administration was anxious not to be associated
with the Hawks, he said.
   The Iranians were dissatisfied with the Hawk missiles because
they weren't designed to shoot down planes flying at high
altitudes, he said.
   In later testimony today, North said he kept $15,000 in cash
inside a metal box bolted down in a closet at his house and used
some of the money to buy a utility vehicle.
   North brought up the metal box in his testimony when prosecutor
John Keker intimated that he might have gotten the money for the
vehicle from a fund used to pay the expenses of Contra leaders.
   North said he established the family cash fund in 1967 with an
insurance settlement he got in an auto accident.
   He said that when he came home at night, he would throw his
change into the metal box.
   ``The change out of your pocket grew to $15,000 in your house?''
asked Keker. North replied affirmatively.
   Keker intimated that the money that paid for the vehicle, a
Chevrolet Suburban with 51,000 miles on the odometer, came from the
fund financed with travelers checks from Contra leader Adolfo
Calero.
   The fund was to pay expenses of rebel leaders when they were in
this country and to support the Iran arms-sales initiative. North
is accused of illegally converting $4,300 of those checks to his
own use, although not in connection with the used vehicle.
   Keker also questioned whether North might have gotten some of
the money for the vehicle from co-defendant Richard Secord, whose
office is near the auto dealership in Tysons Corner, Va.
   ``This car has nothing to do with Calero or Secord, but with the
fund that Ollie North set up in 1967,'' the witness said firmly.
   There had been previous testimony that Calero put $90,000 to
$100,000 traveler's checks into the Contra fund and Secord
contributed $150,000 to $200,000 cash.
   ``I understood perfectly clearly what the purpose of that money
was,'' North said. ``It was to support two operations and that's
what it was used for.
   ``Do you remember being tempted to use the traveler's checks for
your personal use?''
   ``Never once!'' North shot back.

   Three California businessmen charged in
the Pentagon corruption scandal ``knew more than they wanted to
admit they knew'' about a scheme to bribe a Navy engineer, a
prosecutor said today shortly before the case went to the jury.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Hanly said in his closing argument
that the defendants _ Eugene Sullivan, George Kaub and Dale
Schnittjer _ were aware that a private consultant they had hired
was paying bribes to obtain information about a lucrative radar
contract.
   But defense attorney Mark Tuohey, representing Kaub, tried to
pick apart the government's case by pointing out that the main
witnesses had pleaded guilty in exchange for lesser sentences and
were cooperating with the government.
   The defendants, all former executive vice presidents of Teledyne
Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., are accused of conspiracy,
bribery and wire fraud in the first trial stemming from the
government's nearly 3-year-old investigation of kickbacks and
bribery in the Pentagon's purchasing system.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Williams explained the charges to
the jury of four women and eight men before the panel began
deliberating the charges in the week-long trial in early afternoon.
   Tuohey said Kaub had no idea that William Parkin, the private
consultant hired by Teledyne Electronics, had paid money to Stuart
Berlin, a Navy engineer, for details about a $24 million contract
that Teledyne won to make hand-held radar sets. Parkin and Berlin
are among those who pleaded guilty in exchange for helping the
government.
   The government's witnesses had ``every motive in the world to
save their skin,'' Touhey argued. ``... Each came into the
courtroom under immunity promising to cooperate with the
prosecution with a hammer over their heads.''
   But Tuohey said his client was in the dark, a victim of a
conspiracy between Parkin, Berlin and two other men. Their only
motive was ``to get everything you can and don't tell anybody about
it,'' he said.
   But prosecutor Hanly said of the defendants, ``They knew more
than they wanted to admit they knew.''
   The businessmen, who worked with Parkin to ensure he received a
$150,000 contract after Teledyne Electronics was awarded the radar
job, adopted a stance of not pressing for too much information, he
said. Their posture in dealing with Parkin was ``don't tell me any
more, you've told me enough,'' he said.
   During the trial the jury heard tape-recorded conversations
between Parkin and the defendants obtained from wiretaps.

<HEAD>Cattle Rustlers Reportedly Stuffed Stolen Critters Into Little Car</HEAD>

   Cattle rustlers have broadened their range,
transporting stolen animals by Chevette after stuffing them through
the rear hatch, authorities said.
   ``I don't imagine it was easy,'' Sheriff Ralph Bader said
Sunday, adding that the stolen cattle weighed up to 600 pounds.
   The subcompact Chevrolet was recovered as two men were arrested
over the weekend in cow thefts from eight farmers.
   Since December, farmers in this area of western Wisconsin had
been complaining to authorities about single animals missing from
their herds. In all, 16 calves and nine yearling heifers have been
reported stolen.
   Bader said most probably were sold.
   David Webster, an Emerald-area farmer, said cattle were taken
from his farm on three occasions. He said the cows apparently were
roped and walked from the barn to the road, where they were loaded
into a vehicle.
   Asked how two men and a 600-pound cow in a small car could avoid
notice, Bader said, ``At 4 a.m., it's not too easy to see what's
inside a car.''

   A pilot who crash-landed in a grove of palm
trees next to a fast-food restaurant said Monday he expected to die
but hoped he would not take anyone with him.
   ``I got quite a jolt, but everything is looking up,'' Warren
Basler, 62, said in a hospital interview. He was being treated for
a bruised hip, a bump on the head and a swollen hand, but suffered
no broken bones.
   Basler, who owns a small cargo airline in Oshkosh, Wis., slammed
his Beechcraft B-18 into the trees Saturday when both engines
failed shortly after takeoff from Tampa International Airport.
   ``I didn't think I would get out of this alive, but I didn't
want to take a lot of people with me,'' he said.
   The plane just missed a Burger King and landed adjacent to a
busy thoroughfare.
   No one else was injured, but the $400,000, uninsured plane was
destroyed.

   A small town school board asked a federal
appeals court Monday to let it reinstate a ban on dancing, but
dance advocates argued that students should be allowed to remain
footloose.
   ``The rule against dancing may not be smart or reasonable, but
that doesn't mean it's unconstitutional,'' said Ransom Ellis III of
Springfield, attorney for the Purdy School Board in southwestern
Missouri.
   An opposing attorney argued that such a ban would be a
constitutional violation.
   Both sides presented oral arguments before a three-judge panel
of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court took the case
under advisement and will rule later.
   The Purdy School Board is appealing U.S. District Judge Russell
G. Clark's ruling in August that the nearly century-old ban on
dancing on school property violated the constitutional amendment
regarding the separation of church and state.
   After Clark's ruling, students made history in December with a
homecoming dance in the school gymnasium. And now, juniors and
seniors are planning a May prom at school.
   Ellis and the school board have maintained that the ban was a
question of policy and had nothing to do with religion.
   ``There is no religious purpose here,'' said Ellis. ``There is
no evidence that the policy advances religion.''
   Attorney Larry M. Schumaker of Kansas City, who was brought into
the case by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of
students, maintained that religion was the sole reason for the
no-dance rule.
   ``There is no valid secular reason for the rule,'' said
Schumaker. ``We asked the board to give us a valid secular reason
for the rule. They finally said they were just going along with
public opinion.''
   Clark awarded about $80,000 in attorneys fees and expenses to
Schumaker and lawyer William Fleischaker of Joplin.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet navy has found its nuclear submarine at
the bottom of the frigid Norwegian Sea and believes electrical
problems may have caused a fire and explosions that sank it, a
newspaper reported Monday.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said rescuers had found the
bodies of 19 of the 42 sailors killed when the sub sank north of
Norway on Friday.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the 27 survivors were
hospitalized in serious condition at Murmansk, a Soviet Arctic
port, and investigators were able to interview them for only
minutes at a time.
   It also said a government commission praised the crew for
``bravely and intelligently'' working to shut down the sub's
nuclear reactor.
   ``According to preliminary information, the fire started because
of a short circuit,'' Izvestia said, quoting navy investigators in
Murmansk. It said the submarine carried 10 torpedoes, two of them
nuclear-tipped.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov and the
newspaper reiterated previous Soviet statements that there was no
danger of radioactivity being released from the torpedoes or the
reactor.
   Izvestia said search crews had determined the sub's location but
Gerasimov said whether it could be raised was not yet known.
   ``The question of lifting the submarine up has not been decided
yet,'' he told a news briefing. ``It's a bit deep there.''
   Norwegian defense officials in Oslo said the Soviets had a
salvage vessel at the site, but spokesman Erik Senstad there was no
indication whether an attempt would be made to raise the sub from
nearly 5,000 feet below the surface.
   ``We don't even know if the salvage vessel would be capable of
salvaging anything, Senstad told The Associated Press. ``We are
skeptical about the idea that the Soviets are preparing a salvage
operation. The vessels may just have been relatively nearby.''
   He said civilian salvers have raised wrecks and parts of wrecks
from much deeper water, however, and the Soviets presumably would
want to retrieve the sub.
   Vadim Rozanov, press attache at the embassy in Oslo, said Soviet
vessels were in the area to test for radiation, paralleling studies
by Norwegian scientists, but ``I don't know if there are any plans
to salvage the submarine.''
   If the ship was a Mike-class vessel, as believed in the West, it
would contain some of the most advanced Soviet technology, which
the Kremlin would not want disclosed to NATO countries, the
Norwegian news agency NTB reported.
   Norway prepared 10 questions for the Soviets about the sub's
construction and reactor safeguards.
   ``We are not trying to pry into their military secrets, but we
are concerned about other circumstances of safety,'' said Sigrid
Romundset, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.
   Among topics addressed were the reactor cooling system, what
radioactive waste they produce and the strength of the protective
casing around the reactors.
   Members of the Committee on Radiation Accidents, created after
the explosion and fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the
Soviet Ukraine in April 1986, drafted the Norwegian questions.
   In Denmark, the environmental group Greenpeace said a violent
chemical reaciton and explosion might result if the reactors were
cooled by fluid sodium and it made contact with sea water.
   Izvestia quoted Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov as saying ``the
crew heard several explosions'' after two or three hours of trying
to control the fire.
   ``It may be supposed that with the increased pressure on the
sub, special devices began to explode,'' he said. ``There were a
total of seven of them on board. It is possible that the body of
the sub cracked in some places.''
   He did not describe the ``special devices.''
   Soviet media said previously the fire started in the sub's
seventh section and spread to the sixth, but neither section was
identified further.
   Tass said earlier the submarine's captain, E. Vanin, was among
the dead. Izvestia said the log was saved and investigators were
studying it.
   Four sailors went down with the sub, the paper said, and two
pulled from the water died later. It said rescue teams had found
only 19 bodies and continued searching.
   ``Those who were saved are in serious condition,'' Izvestia
said. ``One was in icy water more than an hour.''
   Investigators found no fault with the effort to put out the
fire, Tass reported.
   ``The sailors fought for the life of the ship until the last
minute, and when the end came they managed to shut down the reactor
and guarantee full radioactive safety,'' it said.

   When lifelong Democrat John Kenneth Galbraith
received an embossed invitation from Vice President Dan Quayle to
join the GOP's ``exclusive'' Senatorial Inner Circle, the economist
hastened to accept.
   ``But thus far we've not received his check for $1,000, so his
acceptance sounds a little hollow,'' Quayle spokesman David
Beckwith said Monday.
   Politicians on both sides of the fence have been chuckling over
Galbraith's wry response to the mixup that spawned his invitation
to join the group, whose annual dues go toward getting Republican
candidates elected to the Senate.
   About one-third of the Inner Circle's 6,000 members were in
Washington on Monday for various briefings and a cocktail party at
the vice president's residence.
   ``I don't think Mr. Galbraith will be there,'' said Wendy
DeMocker, a spokeswoman for the Republican Party offshoot.
   ``But we don't really consider his invitation a mistake in that
a number of very prominent Republicans were once Democrats,'' she
added. ``Look at Ronald Reagan.''
   Galbraith, who supported Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' 1988
presidential bid, was an unlikely target for a Republican
fund-raising group's direct mail form letter.
   But once the pitch was made, the Democrat latched onto it,
responding not a little sardonically to the invitation that arrived
on vice presidential stationery.
   ``It was very nice, indeed, of Sen. John Chafee to nominate me
for membership,'' Galbraith wrote in a letter, part of an exchange
reprinted in The Boston Globe. ``There are one or two things that
do trouble me....''
   Galbraith went on to give Quayle a lecture on the ethics of
offering dues-payers access to privileged ``closed door'' briefings.
   ``You are either offering information for money-making purposes
that is not available to the public at large or you are guilty of a
certain fraud in giving the impression that there will be such
advantage,'' he wrote.
   He also issued the 41-year-old vice president a tongue lashing
for what some consider a grammatical faux pas.
   ``In your letter you say that Marilyn (Quayle) and I `would like
to personally invite you to the vice president's residence.''' the
letter reads. ``I will counsel you as a leader in a great
English-speaking country against so ungracious a use of the split
infinitive.''
   Chafee, who Quayle said had sponsored Galbraith's nomination,
said he had met the Harvard University professor on occasion and
found him a pleasant man. But the Rhode Island Republican still
couldn't explain how the liberal's name was picked up by the
Republican fund raisers.
   ``As soon as I saw that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mario Andretti
were on the list (of Inner Circle members), Galbraith's name just
leapt to mind,'' Chafee said tongue-in-cheek.
   Beckwith said the GOP had suffered similar computer hijinks in
the past, but that it was all to the greater good.
   ``When you deal with mailing lists you have to accept a few
inappropriate recipients,'' he said. ``It's happened before with a
few other non-logical people, but none quite so prominent as John
Kenneth Galbraith. ''

   A platoon of plodding pachyderms strolled
through midtown to Central Park on Monday, to the bewilderment of
office workers and the delight of hundreds of children.
   ``New York's a jungle,'' said S.L. Grimes, 38, shaking his head
as he watched the 18 adult elephants and a youngster maneuver
through Columbus Circle.
   The parade and brief show on the park's Great Lawn was a
publicity stunt by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus,
which is in town through April 23.
   Keeping them in line, tails-to-trunks, was whip-wielding Gunther
Gebel-Williams, the animal trainer who is calling this his final
tour.
   Two street cleaners followed the parade, brushing and spraying
away evidence of the elephants' passing.
   Predictably, some motorists were not amused, laying on their
horns as crosstown traffic came to a stop. Others just laughed.
   ``The elephants behave better than the people in the St.
Patrick's Day Parade,'' said a motorcycle officer serving as escort.
   In the park, the elephants chowed down on vegetables and a loaf
of bread offered by Mayor Edward I. Koch, who introduced
Gebel-Williams and spoke about his own bid for a fourth term.
   ``What he does in the ring, I do in the primary,'' Koch told the
uncomprehending schoolchildren. ``He's going to teach me the tricks
of the trade. The first is: Never trust them. Never turn your back
on them.''
   Tiffany Fregara, 9, said the show taught her that ``Elephants
aren't just smelling animals. They're intelligent.''

   Fraternity pledges roused sleepers from
their beds and a pizza parlor closed early to provide some of the
2,145 swimmers who took a lap in a pool to set a one-day relay
record.
   The 19-hour marathon at Hamilton College last weekend apparently
broke the previous mark in the Guinness Book of World Records, set
in April 1986 by 2,135 swimmers, each of whom swam one lap at the
Syracuse YMCA.
   By 12:30 a.m. Sunday, organizers were still more than 100
swimmers shy of the mark, said Jeff VanBuren, a junior at the
college who also participated in the Syracuse event.
   ``We sent all pledges on campus to wake people up and go to
parties to round up more people,'' Van Buren said.
   A pizza shop closed early so its eight workers could each swim a
lap around 1:30 a.m., he said.
   The college in central New York has about 1,700 students, and
Clinton has another 2,100 residents.
   The feat at Hamilton to be verified by Guiness Book officials
before it would replace the previous record.

<TEXT>
   Former congressman Mario Biaggi, who
served 10 terms in the House of Representatives, entered a federal
prison Monday to begin serving a 2{-year term for accepting an
illegal gift.
   Biaggi, 71, maintained he broke no law by accepting a Florida
vacation from former New York City Democratic boss Meade Esposito.
   ``I find myself going to a federal facility today because a
friend of some 35 years was generous to me,'' Biaggi said Sunday
before boarding a plane at Newark, N.J.
   The former hero policeman arrived late Sunday at Dallas-Fort
Worth International Airport and reported to the U.S. Correctional
Facility, a minimum security prison housing 855 inmates, about 1
a.m., said Warden Ron Burkhart.
   Biaggi received institutional clothing and was assigned a place
to live at the prison, a former hospital. He was to receive several
days of orientation, a physical examination and be assigned a job,
Burkhart said.
   ``Everybody does something that is reflective of his abilities
or restrictions,'' Burkhart said. ``We're like a town within a
town.''
   At Newark, Biaggi said he had served his constituents well and
would return ``to pick up where we left off.''
   Biaggi, who parlayed a record as the most highly decorated
police officer in New York City history into a successful political
career, was convicted in September 1987.
   He also was later convicted in the Wedtech defense contractor
scandal and received an eight-year sentence, to be served after the
term he began Monday.
   Before flying to Texas, Biaggi spent the weekend fielding calls
from well-wishers and attended a farewell party Saturday. He also
spent time with his wife, Marie, who is hospitalized with Hodgkin's
disease.

<TEXT>
   Scientists trying to duplicate a
University of Utah experiment that appeared to achieve nuclear
fusion said today they obtained a similar outcome but aren't sure
whether it really was caused by fusion.
   ``This is only one aspect _ the excess energy aspect has been
confirmed,'' said Charles Martin, associate chemistry professor at
Texas A&amp;M University who is working with thermodynamics researchers
Bruce Gammon and Kenneth Marsh on the experiments.
   The scientists cautioned that further research must be done to
confirm that the excess heat generated in the experiment was the
result of nuclear fusion, and not merely an unexplained chemical
reaction.
   ``I would feel a lot more comfortable if we detected fusion, and
we have not yet,'' Martin said.
   The experiment, one of several similar experiments continuing at
Texas A&amp;M, began on Friday and has been running for as much as 40
hours.
   B. Stanley Pons, one of the two researchers whose announcement
on the fusion experiment March 23 in Utah created a sensation in
scientific circles, today praised his Texas counterparts.
   ``The results reported by the scientists at Texas A&amp;M are very
encouraging and are almost precisely the same as those we have
reported,'' Pons, chairman of the University of Utah's chemistry
department, said in a statement. ``We extended our congratulations
to these careful scientists.''
   Pons said he sees the Texas findings ``as very good news,'' and
said he expected increased efforts by scientists around the world
to confirm the experiment now that Texas A&amp;M's results are in. Many
scientists had expressed profound skepticism that fusion could be
achieved without superhigh heat, as the Utah researchers claimed.
   Referring to the excess heat produced by the Texas A&amp;M
researchers, Pons said, ``We look forward to seeing the heat-power
levels that they are able to obtain.''
   Pons and his colleague, Martin Fleischmann of the University of
Southampton England, had reported getting four times as much heat
out of the experiment than they put in, while the Texas researchers
found a smaller increase in heat.
   Marsh, director of the Themodynamics Research Center at Texas
A&amp;M, said the detection of the excess heat was possible because the
school was using extremely sensitive measurement device known as a
calorimeter.
   ``The method that we have used is somewhat different from the
method used by the Utah group,'' Marsh said.
   ``We have measured the energies using a calorimeter, which
compares directly the energy produced by the electrical heater to
that produced by the electrochemical reaction.''
   In the experiments, the researchers used a heater to warm a
solution before reducing the heat and measuring a continuing
increase in temperature. The experiments yielded significantly more
energy, in the form of heat, than they were putting into it in the
form of electric current, researchers said.
   The Texas researchers said they had spoken to their Utah
counterparts by phone and had compared notes, but would exchange
further information with them later this week at a scientific
meeting in Dallas.
   Scientists have been trying to unlock the secrets of nuclear
fusion for decades because it holds the potential for providing a
clean, inexpensive and virtually inexhaustable supply of energy.
   Fusion occurs when the nuclei of atoms are joined together,
creating heat. It is the energy source that powers the sun and
hydrogen bombs. The energy produced by nuclear power plants comes
from fission, which splits atoms.
   Scientists have thought it requires extremely high heat to
achieve fusion.
   But last month, Pons and Fleischmann claimed to have sustained a
controlled fusion reaction at room temperature using equipment
found in any college laboratory. They claimed to have produced four
times as much energy as they put in their experiment.
   Steven Jones of Brigham Young University in Utah said recently
he had achieved fusion in a similar experiment, but obtained far
less energy than Pons and Fleischmann claimed.
   Last week, two Hungarian scientists claimed to have duplicated
the Utah results, Hungary's official MTI news agency reported.
   Last week, the Utah Legislature approved an additional $5
million to develop and patent the new fusion process, to be spent
only if the experiment is confirmed.

   A man opened fire tonight with an Israeli-made
Uzi submachine gun, killing one Arab and wounding two others near
the Jaffa Gate of the Old Walled City of Jerusalem, according to
police and hospital reports.
   Israel Army Radio said some reports from witnesses indicated the
gunman may have been wearing a uniform. It said the assailant ran
into the nearby Mamilla quarter, a deserted area of abandoned
buildings scheduled for demolition.
   Police blocked off the area and began a search.
   The shooting took place about 7:45 p.m. at the Jaffa Gate, one
of the main entrances to the Old Walled City.
   The radio identified the dead man as Mohammed Shawish, a
resident of the Old Walled City.
   Officials at Bikur Holim Hospital said another Arab, identified
as Mahmoud Tarek, 19, of Jerusalem was in critical condition with
wounds to the stomach and head. A third man, Mohammed Awash, was
being treated for at least three bullet wounds to the arms and legs.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Intensify Attack on Jalalabad</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas who besieged
Jalalabad five weeks ago have attacked with new fury, launching
18,000 rockets and shells at the city in 24 hours, the government
said Monday.
   ``This big offensive was launched from afar on the city, backed
by Pakistani artillery,'' a Foreign Ministry statement said.
   Throughout the siege, the Marxist government has sought to
portray the battle as being fought 15 to 30 miles from Jalalabad
without close combat. Its latest statement appears to contradict
that by saying ``the enemy tried to retake positions they had lost
during the battl, without success.''
   As described officially, the guerrilla bombardment would be one
of the heaviest in the fight for Jalalabad, the first major
guerrilla offensive launched after completion of the Soviet
military withdrawal Feb. 15.
   Government reports on the fighting in the past three weeks
indicated the daily total of shells and rockets fired at Jalalabad,
the capital of Nagarhar province 75 miles east of Kabul, had not
exceeded 12,000.
   No confirmation of battle reports is possible because foreign
journalists are not allowed into the area, which is about 45 miles
from the Pakistan border.
   The Foreign Ministry statement, given to Western reporters by
telephone, said soldiers killed 112 enemy fighters in the 24 hours
ending at sundown Monday, including an ``Arab adviser,'' and 70
were wounded. It reported 11 civilians and three government
soldiers killed and 40 shops destroyed.
   It is not known how many people remain in Jalalabad, which
government statistics say had a population of 64,600 two years ago.
Thousands have fled since the siege began March 6.
   As usual, the government said the guerrillas were assisted by
``Pakistani militiamen and Wahhabis tied to Saudi Arabia.'' Both
nations deny direct involvement in the war.
   The Wahhabi sect of Islam is predominant in Saudi Arabia but a
small minority in Afghanistann, where 80 percent of the population
follow the mainstream Sunni branch.
   Wahhabis are a subgroup in the Sunni sect and President Najib
has sought to portray them as heretics.
   Saudi Arabia, the United States, Pakistan and China are the
major supporters of the guerrillas, who began fighting after a
communist coup in April 1978. Soviet military forces entered the
war in December 1979.

<HEAD>North's Decision to Take Witness Stand Risky, but Probably Essential</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Putting Oliver North on the witness stand at
his trial was a risky but probably essential strategy to counter
charges he lied to Congress and personally profited from the
Iran-Contra affair.
   The decision by North and his defense lawyers was probably
predetermined by the nature of the charges against the former
Marine lieutenant colonel and his proven abilities as a witness.
   ``Because of his centrality to the entire case ... Ollie North,
you almost might say, really could not not testify because of who
he is and what he is'' said Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney
in the nation's capital.
   A charismatic speaker whose voice often cracked during emotional
points in his story, North won a wide national following when he
testified for six days in 1987 during televised congressional
hearings on the Iran-Contra affair. He appeared as a sympathetic
and forceful defender of his actions.
   Eliciting that sympathy from the jury which will decide his fate
is a crucial task for the defense. North was probably the best
witness to make his case that he was acting with the full support
and authority of his superiors, including President Reagan.
   ``I felt like a pawn in a chess game being played by giants,''
he told the jury, explaining why he felt a duty to lie to Congress
about secret U.S. military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras at a time
which such aid was illegal.
   North said he didn't think it was wrong to lie because he was
concealing activities that ``I was told, could not, should not be
revealed.''
   But after telling his side for three days from witness stand,
North faced the obvious risks Monday as associate independent
counsel John W. Keker began cross-examination.
   Weighing the gains versus the losses that a skilled prosecutor
can exact on cross-examination is the dilemma all defense attorneys
face in a criminal trial.
   The defendant must answer all questions put to him, and a
skilled prosecutor could bring out damaging admissions from a
defendant. Cross-examination can thus give the prosecution an
opportunity to shore up weak parts of its case by adding to proof
not available from other sources.
   ``The normal rule is you do not want your client to testify. A
client can hurt himself more than he can help himself,'' said
Washington defense lawyer E. Lawrence Barcella.
   But Barcella said the rule ``is filled with exceptions'' that
may well include the North case.
   ``A lot of times a call whether or not to take that risk is
based upon how you are doing by the end of the government's case
... and your gut feeling as to how risky it is for this defendant
to take the stand,'' said Randall J. Turk, another Washington
defense lawyer.
   Turk faced that dilemma when he helped defend former White House
aide Michael K. Deaver, who was convicted of lying under oath about
his lobbying activities. Deaver did not testify at his trial.
   Nor did Lyn Nofziger, a former White House aide convicted of
ethics-law violations who was represented by Barcella.
   But in some white-collar criminal cases, ``sometimes it's
obvious you have to call the defendant,'' Turk says.
   ``So much of what's going on in a white-collar crime case are
questions of a person's honesty and integrity,'' Turk said.
``Usually the cases involve the gray area between something that is
clearly right and clearly wrong.''
   ``The real issue in the cases is the intent of the defendant,''
Turk said. ``The jury is usually very interested in hearing from
the defendant so they can make an assessment.''
   Barcella said one factor is often whether a defense can be built
from other witnesses.
   ``In this particular case, there isn't anybody who can really
explain it as well as he can,'' said Barcella. ``There are a number
of counts he can't really get anybody else to help him with.''
   These include a charge North accepted installation of a $13,800
security fence outside his Great Falls, Va., home in violation of a
law that bars federal employees from accepting gratuities.
   North told jurors that he sought help from arms-dealer Richard
V. Secord when federal officials declined to give his family
protection in 1986 after a terrorist group targeted him as an enemy.
   ``The bottom line of the discussion was that `there isn't a lot
we can do for you; you are too junior,''' North told jurors.
   ``I intended to pay for it,'' he said, but acknowledged, ``I did
not.''
   While Barcella said he found North ``a very persuasive and
convincing witness'' before Congress, the courtroom setting is very
different.
   On Capitol Hill, Barcella said, ``nobody really took control of
North and shut him down'' when he gave rambling answers.
   ``Once he started looking like a fairly sympathetic figure, for
political reasons, none of the congressmen or senators really
wanted to jump in his face,'' Barcella said.
   That won't be the case at his trial, which is under the tight
control of U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   ``Judge Gesell controls the courtroom,'' Barcella said. ``The
jury isn't going to hold against the government what Judge Gesell
does to control Oliver North.''

<TEXT>
   National drug policy director William J.
Bennett announced today a multimillion-dollar federal effort to
crack down on drug-related crime in the nation's capital, saying
the District of Columbia government has ``failed to serve its
citizens.''
   ``Already in the first four months of 1989 the city has seen 135
new murders,'' Bennett told a news conference. ``And that problem
is getting worse, not better.''
   Under the plan, approved today by President Bush, The Federal
Bureau of Prisons will immediately accept 250 prisoners housed in
the local jail, a 500-bed pre-trial detention facility will be
built within one year and a 700-bed federal prison will be
constructed for the Washington-Baltimore area.
   A Washington-area drug task force will get an additional 57
federal, state and local investigators under the plan, including 25
FBI agents and 11 Drug Enforcement Administration agents.
   Five Defense Department intelligence analysts will also be
assigned to the task force, which will concentrate on identifying
crack distributors in the Washington area.
   The effort will cost $70 million to $80 million, Bennett said,
adding that the money would be ``redeployed'' from other uses by
the departments involved. He did not say what current programs the
money would come from.
   Bennett said the plan should not be considered ``an assault on
the principle of home rule,'' but he criticized the District of
Columbia government's handling of the problem of drug-related
violence.
   ``The plain fact is that, for too long and in too many respects,
the D.C. government has failed to serve its citizens,'' Bennett
said.
   He noted that Congress appropriated $50 million three years ago
for a new detention facility in Washington, but no ground has yet
been broken on the project.
   As a result, he said, ``thousands of people arrested for drug
and other serious crimes in this city regularly go free.''
   ``Of course, drugs and demand for drugs sorely test responsive
abilities of dozens of American cities,'' Bennett said. ``But here,
where the problem is so glaring _ so out of control _ serious
questions of local politics and governance can no longer be avoided
or excused. They must be answered.''
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. said he welcomed the extra federal help
in the drug war, but abruptly left a news conference before
reporters could ask him about Bennett's criticisms of his
government.
   ``We welcome the idea of Washington being a model (in the war on
drugs,'' Barry said. ``We look forward to a long working
relationship.''
   ``We don't feel that the city has failed in its management in
this area,'' said city administrator Carol Thompson, who fielded
questions after the mayor's sudden departure.
   Barry has been dogged by allegations that he has used drugs and
by charges against a former associate, Charles Lewis, of
drug-selling in the Virgin Islands. Barry visited Lewis several
times at a Washington hotel in December. The mayor has repeatedly
denied using drugs or having any knowledge of any possible drug
connection involving Lewis.
   In addition to the law enforcement plans, the program outlined
today called for the Department of Housing and Urban Development to
ease regulations on the eviction of drug offenders from federally
funded housing projects.
   Also, the Department of Health and Human Services is to
establish three model out-patient drug clinics in the city that
will provide at least 300 new treatment slots by 1990.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had
reviewed Bennett's plans this morning and the president ``urges
that all agencies of government, federal and local, pull together
to use these ideas and others in solving the ongoing drug-related
crime problem in the District of Columbia.''
   He said the proposals represent a beginning in the joint
federal-state-local campaign against drug abuse focused on
Washington.
   ``While director Bennett's proposals may not be popular, they do
represent a coming to terms with the hard issues,'' the spokesman
said.
   ``America is being tested by the drug epidemic,'' Fitzwater
said, ``and a big part of that test is whether or not we're willing
to adopt many of the difficult measures required in fighting
drug-related crime.''
   Fitzwater said Bush was letting Bennett serve as the lead
spokesman on the plan and that the president ``won't comment on
individual measures.''
   ``It's Bill Bennett's plan,'' he said. ``The president has
reviewed it and approved it in a general sense. ... These are
specific items that are in a series of initiatives.''
   Fitzwater said the initiatives ``will be subject to negotiation
and discussion'' with leaders of the District of Columbia and
officials of suburban jurisdictions, saying that the federal
government cannot impose such a plan on the local governments.
   ``There will be negotiations and discussions with the groups and
we'll ee how the process ticks,'' he said. ``Many of these things
are going to be done over a number of years. Some are going to be
done immediately.''
   Fitzwater said Bush ``has highest confidence in local
jurisdictions. But we want everybody to work together to bring
their expertise to bear on this problem. It's a very fluid type of
situation.''

<HEAD>Four Nurses Admit Killing 49 Patients, Hospital Ward Closed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four nurses who confessed to 49 ``mercy
killings'' of elderly patients plugged the noses of some victims
and forced water into their lungs, police said Monday.
   Police said they doubted the nurses' claim that they killed the
patients to relieve their suffering because of the way the victims
died.
   The first slayings took place in 1983 in a ward of Lainz
hospital, but most of them occurred in the last two years, police
said.
   The ward _ dubbed ``The Death Pavilion'' _ was closed Monday,
and police were checking hospital records.
   Police Chief Guenter Boegl said the nurses gave the patients,
who reportedly ranged in age from 75 to 80, forced water into the
lungs of some victims or gave overdoses of insulin or tranquilizers
to others.
   Police sources said in at least 23 cases the nurses would plug
victims' noses and force water down their throats to induce death
by forcing fluid in the lungs.
   The nurses, identified as Maria Gruber, 25; Irene Leidolf, 27;
Waltraud Wagner, 30; and Stephanie Mayer, 50; are in custody, but
no formal charges had been filed by late Monday.
   Three of the nurses were arrested Friday and the fourth Sunday.
   Police said each nurse knew the others were killing patients.
Investigators said in a few cases two nurses would act together.
   Ms. Wagner acknowledged killing 22 patients with water, police
said. A police spokesman said Ms. Mayer, who was arrested Sunday,
confessed to killing five patients, one of them with water.
   All are in investigative custody after being arrested on
suspicion of murder and attempted murder, but no formal charges
have so far been filed, pending completion of the investigation.
   The police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed reports that an arrest warrant had been issued for a
fifth nurse who is on vacation, but some reports said she may be
innocent and have been implicated in revenge by one of those
arrested.
   The fifth nurse reportedly told doctors a year ago about a
suspicious death at the hospital, but an investigation was
inconclusive.
   One police investigator said the nurses also admitted to killing
patients they considered a nuisance.
   There were fears that the number of victims might still rise.
Under investigators' review are hospital records from 1982 to 1988,
when 3,126 people died in the hospital.
   Officials rejected charges that doctors had failed to supervise
the nurses properly.
   Fritz Gschneit, who was appointed hospital director on Monday,
said it was ``thanks to the alertness of the doctors'' that the
slayings could be discovered.
   Erhard Busek, a city counselor of the Austrian People's Party,
said the city council should hold a special meeting to discuss the
entire health system and called for a committee to probe the
hospital scandal.

   The Soviet Union announced Monday it was
sending two teams of inspectors to the United States for
``short-notice'' inspections of facilities covered by the treaty
banning medium-range nuclear weapons, the Pentagon said.
   Cmdr. Ken Pease, a Pentagon spokesman, said the two 10-member
teams would arrive in Washington on Tuesday and then tell their
American escorts which facilities they wanted to inspect Wednesday
morning.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty authorizes the
United States and Soviet Union to conduct 20 short-notice
inspections this year as part of the procedures to verify the
destruction of all medium-range missiles.
   To date, the Soviets have performed 12 short-notice inspections,
eight at European facilities and four in the United States.

<BYLINE>Ethiopia Says No to U.N. Plan to Aid Southern Sudanese ^By DIDRIKKE
SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethiopia says it won't permit planned
relief shipments into southern Sudan, cutting off a key part of an
effort to avert starvation, a U.N. official said Monday.
   ``It came as a bit of a shock,'' said Vincent O'Reilly, one of
the coordinators of Operation Lifeline Sudan. It aims to provide
170,000 tons of food and supplies to 2.5 million southern Sudanese
displaced by civil war and facing starvation.
   The effort aims to prevent a repetition of the tragedy in 1988
when an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 people died. It hopes to move
the supplies before mid-May, when seasonal rains are expected to
render roads and airstrips unusable.
   The United Nations had hoped to obtain and move 20,000 metric
tons of food into southern Sudan from Ethiopia, one of Operation
Lifeline's eight routes.
   However, Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam over the
weekend sent a telex to UNICEF chief James Grant in New York saying
he could not accomodate the request, said Carlton James, a UNICEF
spokesman in Nairobi. Grant said April 3 he had received assurances
from Ethiopian officials.
   It was not immediately clear why Ethiopia is blocking passage.
   ``The Ethiopia operation has been canned,'' O'Reilly said.
   U.N. officials now hope to move the emergency supplies through
one of the operation's other corridors, possibly the route from
Kenya that already is slated to handle 25,000 tons of food and
supplies by road and air.
   However, O'Reilly said aircraft still have not been donated and
the Kenyan operation could fail without them.
   ``We are completely dependent on an integrated support system,''
said O'Reilly. ``It will succeed or fail based on whether we get a
combination of air and road transport.'' Also, only $80 million of
the $132 million needed for the operation has been pledged, he said.
   Operation Lifeline began April 1 after the Sudanese government
and rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army agreed to allow the
emergency aid to move unhampered to rebel-controlled and
government-held towns in southern Sudan.
   Some relief officials estimate as many as 2 million people may
have died since Sudan's war broke out in 1983, mostly civilians
driven from their homes who either died seeking shelter or starved
to death in refugee camps and besieged towns.

<HEAD>Three North Koreans Attend Conference Under New Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three North Koreans are attending an academic
conference in the United States under a new U.S. policy designed to
reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula, an official said Monday.
   The three arrived late last week for a conference at the
University of Hawaii and will probably visit other academic centers
in the United States as well, said the State Department official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The decision to let North Koreans visit the United States was
part of a policy shift adopted last October at the request of South
Korea.
   The U.S. ally hoped that a gesture from Washington would
encourage more openness by the North Korean government toward its
southern neighbor and arch-rival, although contacts so far between
the sides have not yielded significant progress.
   The United States does not have diplomatic ties with North
Korea, listing it among a handful of countries that support
terrorism.
   Nonetheless, the new U.S. policy lifted a ban on contacts with
North Korean officials outside the United States, and three
meetings have been held so far between American and North Korean
diplomats in Beijing. The last meeting was Feb. 28, said the
official.
   He said the meetings amounted to an exchange of views and could
not be termed negotiations, although further meetings are expected.

   The Coast Guard is making permanent its
decision not to seize vessels when only small qualtities of drugs
are found on board.
   The agency announced Monday a rulemaking that would subject the
owners of commercial fishing vessels to a summons in cases when
personal-use quantities of illegal drugs are found on their ships.
   The issuing of summonses in such cases was instituted on an
interim basis Feb. 16 and the rulemaking would make that permanent,
the Coast Giard said.
   Before that, vessels had been subject to immediate seizure when
any quantity of drugs was found.
   The new regulation covers commercial fishing, fish processing
and fish tender vessels.
   Separate laws extend similar protection to ferry boats, cruise
ships and other commercial vessels in cases in which a passenger
brings small qualtities of drugs on board. However, these vessels
remain subject to seizure if there is evidence that the master or
operator of the vessel was aware of the violation.

   Two Turkish freighters collided
Monday in heavy fog off the central coast, and one sank,
authorities said. Fourteen crewmen aboard the sunken vessel were
reported missing.
   The accident occurred in the Adriatic Sea about 10 miles south
of Palagruza Island and about 70 miles off the Yugoslav coast,
according to Petar Asanovic, harbormaster at the port city of Split.
   The ships, both flying Turkish flags, were the freighters Deval,
carrying a cargo of iron ore; and the Selim, with a cargo of steel
beams, Asanovic said. It was not immediately clear where they were
heading.
   The Deval sank in Yugoslav territorial waters within minutes of
the collision, Asanovic said. Only three of its 17-member crew were
picked up by a flotilla of Yugoslav and Italian rescue boats.
   One of those survivors suffered serious injuries and was
hospitalized in a coma, the port official said.
   The Selin remained afloat, and no injuries were reported among
its crew.

<HEAD>Air Force Captain Shocked at Cost of Repair Kits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has paid Lockheed Corp. more
than $26 million for 47 repair kits for its C-5 cargo planes and
may buy 100 more despite warnings that the kits are overpriced, a
newspaper reported.
   Items in the kits include a business card-sized metal plate
priced at $114 and a splicer costing $362, the Dayton Daily News
said Sunday, citing an Air Force cost analyst's report.
   The kits are designed to fix the aircraft's landing gear main
frames, outer wings, and wheel wells, and part of its lower
fuselage in the event of a major crash, the newspaper said.
   According to internal Air Force memos and reports obtained by
the newspaper, Air Force officials have questioned the cost of and
the need for the kits, as well as the decision to buy them from
Lockheed.
   Capt. Kathy Johnson, a cost-price analyst, visited a Lockheed
plant in Marietta, Ga., last June and later recommended reviewing
the kits' 6,000 types of parts.
   Ms. Johnson cited apparent overpricing and warned it could lead
to negative publicity for the Air Force, the Daily News said.
   Eric M. Thorson, an assistant Air Force secretary, echoed her
fears in a memo one month later after learning that a limited
review of the orders found 39 percent of the parts to be
overpriced, the newspaper said.
   Col. Allan V. Cummings, a spokesman for the Air Force Logistics
Command at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, said the
figures cited were only Lockheed's proposed prices.
   ``The Air Force should not be chastised for paying prices that
we've not finally agreed upon,'' he said.
   Lt. Gen. Claudius E. Watts III, the comptroller of the Air
Force, noted in a memo that money and kits were changing hands
while neither contractor nor buyer could say what the kits
contained or what they ultimately would cost, the Daily News said.

   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas met
Monday with Secretary of State James A. Baker III to discuss ways
of resolving the crisis in Lebanon.
   Dumas, emerging from the two-hour meeting, said Lebanon was on
their agenda but declined to elaborate. ``We are studying
possibilities for installing peace in the region,'' he told
reporters.
   France is sending two ships loaded with fuel, medicine and food
to help ease shortages in Lebanon caused by a month of the worst
sectarian fighting since 1985. Published reports say the ships are
due Wednesday.
   Dumas, who meets with President Bush on Tuesday, said he also
discussed with Baker details of the planned visit of President
Francois Mitterrand to the United States next month.
   Dumas, who arrived Monday and leaves Tuesday, is also scheduled
to meet with Defense Secretary Dick Cheyney, Vice President Dan
Quayle, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and congressional
leaders.
   Meanwhile, Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League's representative in
Washington, said the league would try to obtain another cease-fire
in Lebanon and would meet in Kuwait later in the week with
representatives of Christian forces.
   ``The Lebanese are suffering the mutual madness of this
collective shelling,'' he said at a news conference.
   Maksoud, who met Monay with Paul Hare, acting deputy assistant
secretary of State for the Near East, said the State Department
largely supports the league's cease-fire initiative.

<HEAD>Turmoil in Iran Seen as Barring Progress in Talks With Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political turmoil in Iran is likely to prevent
significant progress in a new round of peace talks with Iraq
expected to be held soon, an exiled Iranian said Monday.
   Shahram Chubin, an exiled Iranian historian, said that with two
of his senior aides losing their posts in the past few weeks,
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran would probably stick to
a hard-line course rather than expose himself to criticism at home.
   ``And of course, Iraq would have little incentive to offer too
much if it is not getting an response,'' said Chubin, who worked at
the London Institute for Strategic Studies before taking a teaching
post at Geneva's prestigious Graduate Institute of International
Affairs.
   Iranian Foreign Ministry officials and U.N. officials met last
week to lay groundwork for a new round of talks between Velayati
and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz. They have agreed to hold the
talks in the near future at an undisclosed site near U.N.
headquarters in New York, but no date has been set. The talks have
been deadlocked since November over Iran's insistence that Iraqi
troops withdraw from Iranian territory, while Iraq insists that the
first step should be the clearing of war debris from the Shatt
al-Arab waterway on the border.
   Before a U.N.-brokered U.N. agreement last August, at least 1
million people were killed or wounded in the eight-year Persian
Gulf War. Some estimates of the dead alone surpass 1 million, and
the economic cost totals hundreds of billions of dollars.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Chubin noted that
ousted Deputy Foreign Minister Javad Mohammad Larijani and Jaffar
Mahallati, Iran's U.N. ambassador, were both associates of
Velayati. He also said there is some uncertainty whether Velayati
himself will last.
   Chubin said pragmatists in the Foreign Ministry are now
struggling to push their views while radicals like Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashami ``are making as much capital as
possible.''
   The historian predicted that Khomeini will avoid a definitive
stand, ``sometimes taking one side and sometimes the other.''
   ``Khomeini is too clever to entrust the future of the Islamic
Republic to one faction,'' he said.
   Also in Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross
said 66 Iraqi prisoners of war were repatriated on Monday after
their unilateral release by Iran.
   The Geneva-based humanitarian agency said the prisoners were all
wounded, sick or elderly. Four other prisoners refused to be
repatriated and remained in Iran, it said.
   Iran had said it would free the prisoners to mark the 10th
anniversary of the founding of the Islamic Republic.
   More than 100,000 war prisoners are still held by Iran and Iraq,
according to Red Cross estimates. Only 2,295 have been released
since the cease-fire.

<HEAD>EPA Says Lead in Many School Drinking Fountains Still a Health Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Monday more than a million school water fountains still have lead
components or lead-lined tanks, posing possible health risks to
youngsters.
   EPA officials said they would soon issue a detailed guide for
school officials on how to test for unhealthy lead levels, and the
agency listed 113 manufactuers' model numbers for fountains in
which lead levels were found to be of concern.
   The officials emphasized that school water fountains likely
account for only a very small part of the lead exposure that
youngsters face. And they said it was uncertain whether the high
lead levels in some coolers were from the coolers or water pipes.
   Nevertheless, said Mike Cook, director of the EPA's office of
water contamination, the agency urged school officials to test
cited coolers, especially those in which tanks were found to be
lined with lead.
   ``We found very high levels of lead in these (lead-lined)
tanks,'' said Cook.
   The EPA has no authority to order the testing, but a law enacted
last year requires states to begin a program to assist school
districts in testing for lead in drinking water. School officials
in many states already have testing programs under way, officials
said.
   Lead is a toxic metal that is harmful to health even at low
levels of exposure. It can cause damage to the brain and nervous
system and lead to learning disabilities, hearing impairment, and
interference in the formation of red blood cells, according to the
EPA.
   The EPA considers a lead level of 20 parts per billion in water
to pose health risks, especially if a child is exposed to lead from
other sources as well. The agency estimates lead in drinking water
typically accounts for about 20 percent of the total exposure in
young children.
   ``We think that there are a few hundred thousand children who
have enough lead from other sources so when lead from drinking
water is added at levels of 20 parts per billion there will be some
adverse health impact,'' said Cook in an interview.
   While the agency gave no specific levels of lead in water from
all the coolers cited by model number, it said the coolers were
singled out only after levels were found to be in the unhealthy
range.
   In coolers with lead-lined tanks the levels were more than
``several hundred'' parts per billion and in some cases when
long-standing water was tested the level was more than 1,000 parts
per billion, according to Cook. In the other coolers cited by the
EPA, often only a single soldering connector brought lead into
contact with the water.
   The agency said it had no estimate on how many coolers with
lead-lined tanks are still being used in schools. Cook in an
interview said the EPA ``stumbled'' upon the tanks _ all on coolers
made by Halsey Taylor Co. _ when examining 22 water coolers
provided by the U.S. Navy.
   Nine of the Navy coolers were found to have lead-lined tanks,
causing the EPA to become concerned. Cook said similar water
coolers are used in schools and that the EPA received two such
coolers from school officials in Portland, Maine.
   The new law requires the EPA to issue detailed guidelines on how
to detect lead contamination in school water systems as well as
provide a list of the brand and models of water coolers that have
lead components. There also is a timetable for eliminating those
coolers or correcting the problem.
   The coolers cited by model number were manufacturers by three
companies _ Halsey Taylor, EBCO Manufacturing Co., and Sunroc Corp.
The EPA said two other companies have yet to reply to inquiries on
lead content in their coolers and a third said it produced no
coolers with lead components.
   Cook said that lead in school drinking fountains is only one of
many sources causing health risks to children. Lead contamination
more often comes from the use of lead solder in pipes that carry
the water. Children also can be exposed to lead in the air and in
paint, although such exposure has been reduced with the gradual
elimination of leaded gasoline and lead paint.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Teddy Kollek told foreign mayors Monday
at a conference on ethnic conflict in cities that Jerusalem's Jews,
Moslems, and Christians ``will never integrate.''
   However, he also played down the impact on Jerusalem of the
16-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands, saying:
``There are tensions, but they are less than you see on your TV.''
   During the uprising, 422 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been
killed, including two Arabs and a Jew in Jerusalem. Israel seized
Arab east Jerusalem when it captured the occupied territories from
Arab neighbors in the 1967 Middle East war, and it later made the
city its capital.
   In the conference, Kollek described the problems of governing
Jerusalem for about 30 mayors from 16 countries, including the
United States.
   ``We'll always have Jews, Moslems and Christians in this city,''
Kollek said. ``But unlike in other cities, here they will never
integrate. It is not their purpose.''
   Kollek said city officials must also deal with sometimes
clashing Christian denominations.
   ``There are 40 different Christian denominations in Jerusalem.
Sometimes these groups are very competitive amongst themselves over
the holy places, rights, the times they are allowed to pray in
various churches,'' Kollek said.
   Speaking after Kollek's address, Mayor William Boner of
Nashville, Tenn., elicited laughter when he said: ``Mayor Kollek,
after hearing you, I don't think I have any ethnic conflicts in
Nashville.''
   In Nashville, Boner said, blacks make up about 22 percent of the
city's population of about 500,000.
   ``As a group, blacks in Nashville are poor, they're less healthy
.... They are more prone to crime and drug abuse,'' Boner said.
``Such disparity has produced resentment, despair and crucial
issues for we mayors.''
   Mayor Joanne Benjamin of Los Gatos, Calif., said one of the main
challenges facing her city of 28,000 people was providing education
for the children of Hispanic and Vietnamese immigrants. She said
many speak little or no English.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Whistle-Blower Bill Into Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed legislaton Monday
expanding job protection to federal whistle-blowers, a revamped
version of a measure vetoed late last year by then-President Reagan.
   ``The true whistle-blower is a public servant of the highest
order,'' Bush said at the signing ceremony in the Old Executive
Office Building attended by the measure's congressional sponsors.
   The legislation will provide increased protection from firing
and demotion for federal employees who disclose misdeeds and
mismanagement in the agenices where they work.
   Bush called the bill ``a significant improvement'' over the one
Reagan vetoed.
   The new measure does not contain a provison, opposed by Reagan,
that would have permitted the Office of Special Counsel to go to
court on behalf of whistle-blowers. Reagan protested that this
would have resulted in federal agencies battling each other in
court.
   Under the new act, employees fighting for their jobs would face
less stringent standards of proof that their firing or demotion
resulted from whistle-blowing.
   The Office of the Special Counsel, established eight years ago
to investigate civil service abuses, will become an independent
agency under the new law. The office now is an arm of the Merit
Systems Protection Board and has been criticized in Congress on
grounds that it has done little to assist whistle-blowers.
   Whistle-blowers now will be able to take their cases directly to
the board if the special counsel does not act within 120 days.
   Joining Bush in the signing ceremony were the legislation's
co-authors, Sens. Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Rep. Frank Horton,
R-N.Y., and other sponsors.
   ``We used to think of a whistle-blower as some guy in a funny
hat running around on a field with a black-and-white shirt on,
always throwing down the flag,'' Bush said.
   ``But that might well be an apt comparison to the business at
hand because whistle blowing is, after all, the one who cries foul
to waste, fraud and abuse.''
   ``I share the determination of Congress that we do everything
possible to ensure that these dedicated men and women should not be
fired or rebuked or suffer financially for their honesty and good
judgment,'' he added.
   However, in a separate statement, Bush also voiced confidence in
agency heads.
   ``Although whistle-blowers clearly can and do contribute to
better government, these managers respond regularly to a variety of
problems, including those disclosed by whistle-blowers, without
special statutory provisons and procedures,'' the statement said.
   Bush earlier in the day praised volunteers of another sort,
signing a proclamation at a Rose Garden ceremony making this
National Volunteer Week.
   ``You're winning because you refuse to believe that it can't be
done,'' he told an invited audience of individuals and
representatives of various volunteer organizations.
   ``I always like to remember that there is no exercise better for
the human heart than reaching down and lifting someone else up,''
Bush said.

   A nation's pain and outrage are being felt
in the governor's office, where staffers have answered thousands of
calls from Americans touched by scenes of oil-choked animals on
blackened beaches.
   Gov. Steve Cowper's staff have answered as many as 1,200 phone
calls a day since the Exxon Valdez ruptured on a reef south of
Valdez on March 24, dumping 10.1 million gallons of oil into Prince
William Sound.
   The switchboard really lights up each day after the network TV
news broadcasts on the East Coast, when it's still early afternoon
in Juneau. The most emotional calls come in response to televised
scenes of dead or suffering animals.
   ``People call here crying,'' said Laury Roberts Scandling,
Cowper's director of constituent relations. ``Their first reaction
is outrage and anger.''
   Some offer sympathy or opinion, ask how to help, offer money.
Others try to sell products to help in the cleanup.
   The unusually hectic pace the oil spill has imposed on Cowper's
office has taken its toll on Cowper and his staff of 20.
   ``A lot of us are tired,'' Scandling said late last week. ``Our
families don't see us. People are tense and sometimes we all have
to stop.''
   Cowper came down with the flu late last week and had to work
from the governor's mansion for two days.
   ``All of us have colds,'' Scandling said. ``It really knocked
Cowper down.''
   Cowper's wife, Michael, has come in daily to answer calls with
the seven staffers who share the duty. Andy Spear, a former state
environmental official, was hired to set up a call-screening
procedure and field technical inquiries.
   In addition to calls, Cowper's office each day has received
about 50 spill-related letters, several telegrams, product samples
and countless messages on the office telecopier.
   ``The fax goes 24 hours a day,'' Spear said.
   One manufacturer mailed a bottle of crude oil and an absorbent
to demonstrate the absorbent's effectiveness. ``It smelled up my
office,'' Scandling said.
   Spear, who used to head the state's oil-pollution control
program, refers the samples to officials on the spill scene. Some
of the products have been used, he said, citing a cork material
that had been adopted as an absorbent.
   Although Spear said some suggestions border on the ``wacko,''
even those are not immediately dismissed.
   A California woman who suggested pouring Dawn dishwashing liquid
on the oil slick to break it up was not far off the mark. That
brand has long been used to clean oil off sea mammals and birds,
Spear noted.
   ``You never know,'' he said. ``I hate to discourage anyone who
may have a good idea.''
   Most of the letters, however, are lean on ideas and thick on
emotions.
   ``Probably nine out of 10 letters begin with, `I'm sad, I'm very
angry, I'm outraged,' '' Scandling said.
   A Florida man wrote a terse letter to say had destroyed his
Exxon credit card. A Coloradan said he had canceled his 11-week
summer vacation in Alaska although he knew it would not take him
near Prince William Sound.
   ``Long I've heard about no taxes in Alaska _ the oil people pay
for everything,'' he wrote. ``Well, you sold your soul and now are
paying the price.''

   Hundreds of abortion rights activists, buoyed
by the record turnout for their march on the Capitol, lobbied
members of Congress on Monday as stalwarts of the women's movement
predicted that their effort will leave a lasting impression on the
Supreme Court.
   That view, however, was not shared by at least one member of the
Bush administration _ Vice President Dan Quayle.
   The march was ``nothing unusual in this town,'' he said. ``I
don't believe the Supreme Court should be, nor do we expect it to
be, swayed by a demonstration. That is not the way the system is
supposed to work. They are there to render a legal opinion.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Everyone
has the right to march and present their views. It appears that it
was a very successful march over the weekend in terms of the number
of people they wanted to get here. They presented their views very
effectively and that's good.''
   Advocates who took part Sunday in the largest abortion rights
rally got their first taste of lobbying as they traveled from House
offices to Senate buildings, delivering information packages
containing a 30-minute ``Abortion for Survival'' video and pressing
their cases.
   In most instances, lawmakers were absent and activists met with
congressional staff. But the circumstances did little to dampen
their enthusiasm.
   ``We'd like very much for him to see it,'' Jeanette D. Newsom,
of Sylva, N.C., told a staff member for Republican Sen. Jesse Helms
as her husband Gene presented the packet.
   The couple _ he's a farmer, she's a librarian _ from the tiny
town of 1,700 near Asheville have written Helms in support of the
Equal Rights Amendment, nuclear freeze and environmental issues.
They traveled from Sylva to march in the demonstration and lobby in
person.
   ``After lobbying on the state level, we naively assumed we could
do it here in Washington, D.C.,'' said Gene Newsom before the
couple headed to the offices of North Carolina's other senator,
Democrat Terry Sanford.
   Hundreds of thousands of activists, including mothers with small
children, Hollywood stars and college students, converged on the
Capitol to show their support for the 1973 Supreme Court decision
that legalized abortion.
   Law enforcement officials estimated the crowd at 300,000 but
Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, put
the total at 600,000.
   The turnout far exceeded the 90,000 people who gathered for a
March 1986 abortion rights rally in Washington and the numbers
organizers had predicted. Leaders said the response will have an
impact on the Supreme Court.
   ``Nobody in public office isn't affected by a huge outpouring,''
said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women.
   Questioned about lobbying members of Congress rather than
focusing on the court, Yard noted that lawmakers are in contact
with the nine justices.
   ``Do you think the leadership in this body doesn't talk to the
Supreme Court? Sure they do,'' Yard said. ``Do you think members of
the Bush administration don't talk to the Supreme Court? Sure they
do.''
   Francoise Jacobsohn, president of the New York City chapter of
NOW, said the congressional lobbying was ``a logical progression of
what we did yesterday. We have a political army.''
   ``We cannot stand for erosion. We have been complacent,'' said
Jacobsohn, who said in the past the attitude has been, ``we already
fought this fight, why do we have to fight it again.''
   Activists plan to gather again on April 26 when the court will
hear arguments in a Missouri case that pro-choice and anti-abortion
forces agree could significantly alter the ruling that gave women
the right to an abortion.

<HEAD>Former Government Secretary Says She Spied for Love</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former secretary for
high-ranking government officials said Monday at the opening day of
her espionage trial that she gave state secrets to a Soviet spy
because she loved him.
   Federal prosecutors say defendant Elke Falk passed sensitive and
secret documents to the KGB Soviet intelligence service between
1975 and 1985.
   Ms. Falk, 44, said she began spying after falling in love with
Gerhard Thieme, who prosecutors say worked for the KGB. She said
Thieme persuaded her to spy for him while the two were vacationing
in communist East Germany.
   Testifying before the Northrhine-Westphalia State Supreme Court
in Duesseldorf, she said she delivered Thieme documents about NATO
troop maneuvers in West Germany.
   Ms. Falk told the court ``money played no role whatsover'' in
her spying activities. She said she instead hoped for a ``common
future with Gerhard.''
   Court documents say she was paid about $270 on several
occasions, but even prosecutors have not described her motives in
terms of greed.
   She formerly worked for the state secretary of the federal
Chancellery and also held posts in the federal transportation and
economic development ministries.
   Prosecutors said she gave the KGB copies of Cabinet and Security
Council minutes and also provided information on briefings compiled
by the West German intelligence services.
   Investigators said the documents contained information on
national defense and security strategy and foreign policy questions.
   Ms. Falk testified that she began spying after meeting Gerhard
Thieme through a personal advertisement in a newspaper.
   She said that at the time she worked in the West German
chancellor's office and she had to ``overcome many scruples'' in
order to get herself to meet Thieme's requests.
   The indictment alleges Ms. Falk used a miniature camera in a
cigarette lighter to copy documents she smuggled out of government
offices in a shopping bag fitted with a secret compartment. She hid
film from the camera in a specially-designed can of hair spray and
in a plant watering can, the indictment said.
   Court officials said 18 witnesses are to testify at the trial,
which is expected to last 12 days. She could receive up to 10 years
in prison.
   Ms. Falk has been in custody since March 1988.
   West Germany is periodically rocked by discoveries that
communist agents have infiltrated government positions.
   Willy Brandt was forced to resign as chancellor in 1974 after
one of his top aides, Guenter Guillaume, was unmasked as an East
German agent. Guillaume was sentenced to 13 years in prison but
released after six years in a spy swap with East Germany.
   Another famous spying case resulted in an eight-year sentence in
August 1987 for Margaret Hoeke, a former secretery for five West
German presidents who also said she passed state secrets to a KGB
agent out of love for the man.

<TEXT>
   The government on Monday called off talks
with Basque separatists in Algeria after a series of bombings
believed to be the work of the Basque group injured two people.
   The latest injury occurred early Monday, when a mail bomb
exploded at a military training school in the Pyrenee Mountain town
of Jaca. Sgt. Joaquin Borbonado y Ruez was injured and later had
two fingers amputed, a military statement in Barcelona said.
   The attacks began after the Basque separatist group ETA last
week broke off a three-month moratorium on attacks against
government targets. It had declared the moratorium April 4 in
exchange for the talks in Algiers.
   ``The government, with the agreement of the major political
parties, has attempted to carry on a dialogue that would lead to
the elimination of violence in the Basque country and the rest of
Spain,'' Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera told reporters.
   ``Unfortunately, ETA's position of unilaterally ending the hopes
raised to this end obliges the government to put an end to the
dialogue.''
   In addition to the bomb at the military school, police defused a
mail bomb Monday sent to Julen Elgorriaga, a government official in
Vitoria. The city is capital of the three-province Basque region in
northern Spain.
   Later Monday, several thousand people, including Elgorriaga,
marched through the Basque city of Irun to protest a mail bomb that
injured a high school gym teacher there on Friday.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the mail bombs, but
authorities suspect ETA.
   A telephone caller called a travelers' bureau and claimed
responsibility for ETA for a series of rail bombings on Saturday.
No one was injured in those attacks.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for the deaths of more than 600
people in its 21-year campaign to secure self-determination for
their region.
   In his press briefing, Corcuera also said Spain would continue
to request international help in its fight against ETA terrorism.
   Authorities in France have jailed or deported a number of
high-level ETA members. Algeria has received some of those members
but hinted recently that its hospitality might have limits if the
talks fail.
   ETA says the government has failed to live up to its side of the
agreements reached during the first phase of the talks, which began
in mid-January.
   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said
it was only prepared to discuss a way to end violence and how and
when ETA would lay down its arms. It refused to enter into
political negotiations on the future of the Basque country and its
2.1 million residents.

   British and Australian soldiers were
deployed Monday in the north to monitor the pullout of nationalist
guerrillas, and officials said U.N.-supervised independence
elections would go ahead despite recent fighting.
   The nearly 100 British and Australian soldiers, members of the
U.N. peacekeeping force, arrived in the northern region of Ovambo
on Monday for deployment at the checkpoints where guerrillas are to
report Tuesday before they return to bases in Angola.
   Louis Peinaar, South Africa-installed administrator of the
territory, said he expected U.N.-supervised elections to be held as
scheduled in early November, provided that insurgents of the
South-West Africa People's Organization withdrew.
   In the United Nations, the president of the Security Council
said all parties concerned intend ``to stick to the procedures
which were agreed'' on the turnover of Namibia to a black-majority
government after 74 years of South African rule.
   ``We're looking forward once again to elections in Namibia and
to full independence,'' said Soviet Ambassador Alexander M.
Belonogov, who is council president this month.
   Chester Crocker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state who
mediated negotiations to clear the way for independence, said in
Windhoek that diplomatic pressure has forced SWAPO to order the
withdrawal.
   South Africa said 1,900 guerrillas crossed the border from
Angola starting April 1, the day a cease-fire was to have taken
effect. Heavy fighting continued for a week, leaving 263 guerrillas
and 27 security forces dead by South African count.
   SWAPO leader Sam Nujoma ordered the insurgents to leave Namibia
on Sunday. Crocker, referring to this order, said SWAPO ``didn't
reverse itself voluntarily'' and indicated that Angola and its
Cuban allies had persuaded Nujoma to order the retreat.
   Starting Tuesday, the guerrillas are to report to border posts
and assembly points so that members of the U.N. monitoring force
can escort them to bases in Angola.
   South African, Cuban and Angolan officials agreed at a weekend
meeting that the guerrillas could have safe passage out until
Saturday. Soviet and U.S. officials, including Crocker, observed
the meeting at a Namibian game lodge.
   Police reported calm in the northern bush for the second day
Monday, and said they were waiting to see whether the guerrillas
obeyed the withdrawal orders. The lull follows the fiercest
fighting in the 23-year war for this mineral-rich territory, which
South Africa has ruled since World War I.
   Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, the senior U.N. official in
Namibia, said messages were being broadcast on radio advising the
guerrillas to go to churches as a preliminary step before reporting
to the designated assembly points.
   He told journalists no official cease-fire was in effect, ``but
the South Africans have undertaken to restrain their forces.''
   Ahtisaari declined to blame anyone for the near-collapse of the
independence plan.
   ``There has been a major mistake made,'' he said. ``But my job
is to build bridges and get this plan back on track.''
   The United Nations has authorized a peacekeeping force of 4,650
soldiers for Namibia, but only about 1,000 have arrived.
   South Africa contends SWAPO's incursion violated an agreement
that the insurgents would remain at bases at least 100 miles inside
Angola until mid-May.
   Nujoma maintained that many of the guerrillas had been inside
Namibia before April and should be allowed to set up bases in the
territory.
   SWAPO had been favored to win the most votes in pre-independence
elections for an assembly that will draft a constitution.
   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December when
South Africa, Angola and Cuba signed a regional peace plan. Cuba
agreed to withdraw 50,000 Cuban troops who have helped
Marxist-ruled Angola battle U.S.-backed rebels. In exchange, South
Africa agreed to stop supporting the Angolan rebels and allow
Namibia to become independent.

   Zukerman was the conductor and violin soloist at Gregorian's
inauguaral concert Sunday. Following the performance, Gregorian

   ``If there is anything that unites us, it is music,'' Zukerman
said in accepting the honor.
   ``I didn't know playing a fiddle would bring me all this,'' the
violinist said as he stood on stage in a brown robe from the Ivy
League school.
   As an added surprise, Gregorian introduced Zukerman's daughter,
who had been in the audience listening to her father play Antonio
Vivaldi's ``The Four Seasons.''
   ``Now with this additional power given to Mr. Zukerman, lets see
what he can do as a Brown graduate,'' Gregorian said.

   The city has sued Conrail and Monsanto Co. to
recover the costs of cleaning up a train derailment and chemical
spill that forced the evacuation of more than 10,000 residents two
years ago.
   In the lawsuit filed Friday in federal court, the city said it
spent about $225,000 for police and fire protection, evacuation of
the Bloomfield neighborhood and cleanup of the spill.
   City solicitor Dan Pellegrini said Monday the city had failed to
negotiate a settlement with Conrail and Monsanto and was suing
because the statute of limitations was running out.
   Adjacent Allegheny County, which Pellegrini said had incurred
about $25,000 in expenses, also has sued.
   A Conrail freight train derailed along a curve and knocked a
second train, carrying phosphorous oxychloride, off parallel tracks
in the April 11, 1987, accident.
   The chemical is a gasoline additive produced by Monsanto that
can react chemically with moisture in the lungs to produce
hydrochloric acid.
   Bloomfield was evacuated twice, on April 11 and April 12, and 70
people were hospitalized for treatment of skin, eye and lung
irritation.
   The lawsuit charges the defendants were negligent in failing to
maintain and label their equipment, in using an unsafe tank car and
transporting the chemical through heavily populated areas.
   Monsanto attorney Randy Struk said a March 1988 study had
determined that burning phonograph records from one of the freight
cars caused the only major risk in the accident. The records
released hydrogen chloride gas, he said.
   Struk said the Monsanto spill ``did not leave any adverse health
or environmental effects on the Bloomfield community.''
   Spokeswoman Kathy Meehan said Conrail had no comment.

   Rodney Dangerfield made a real-life demand
for respect Monday in court, receiving a trial date in a lawsuit
accusing a hotel chain of using his querulous voice for commercials
without permission.
   U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian scheduled a pretrial
hearing Sept. 11 and trial Oct. 17 unless Dangerfield and Park Inns
Inc. of Dallas can reach a settlement.
   Dangerfield's lawyer, John Lavely, said outside court the comic
is adamant about pursuing the case in which an impersonator
mimicked Dangerfield's voice on a radio commercial for the hotel
chain.
   ``Rodney believes in this case,'' said Lavely. ``The case poses
the question of whether someone can do a satire of a famous person
and get the benefit of something someone has spent their whole life
developing.''
   In Dangerfield's case, he said, the entertainer has spent a
lifetime developing a unique voice, style and remarks such as, ``I
can't get no respect.''
   Attorneys for Park Inns argue they have the right to satirize
any famous person and note that their commercial, which began
running in the summer of 1988 and has since been discontinued,
contained a disclaimer saying that celebrity voices were
impersonated.
   Dangerfield was not in court Monday, but he said in his
complaint that the disclaimer was insufficient and contained an
additional comment which suggested the disclaimer itself was a joke.
   The complaint noted that the voice impersonator chimed in after
the disclaimer with, ``You mean this guy ain't a real announcer? He
really had me fooled. He sounded so good.''
   Dangerfield and his Paper Clip Productions claim damages ``in
excess of $10,000'' on each of five causes of actions plus punitive
damages.
   Dangerfield claims that Park Inns made substantial profits as a
result of using his voice and deprived him of the chance to sell
his name and likeness for such endorsements.
   ``If there were 50 of these (commercials) on the air, Rodney
wouldn't be able to get arrested,'' said Lavely.

   The Justice Department is recommending that
President Bush veto any legislation that would write into law the
fairness doctrine and require that broadcasters air opposing views
on controversial issues.
   In a letter to Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., Assistant Attorney
General Thomas M. Boyd said the doctrine, which the Federal
Communications Commission repealed in 1987, was outdated, hindered
free expression and unduly discriminated against broadcasters in
favor of the print media.
   Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
introduced a bill this year that would make the doctrine law. The
bill was passed by the Energy and Commerce telecommunications and
finance subcommittee last week and is to be considered by the full
committee Tuesday.
   It is virtually identical to a measure passed by Congress in
1987 but vetoed by then-President Reagan. The present measure is
expected to pass Congress again.
   Although Bush has not indicated his view on the fairness
doctrine since he took office, he said on the campaign trail last
year he was against such a law.
   Boyd said the White House Office of Management and Budget had
advised him that enactment of a bill ``would not be in accord with
the program of the president.''
   A copy of Boyd's letter to Dingell, dated last Wednesday and
obtained Monday, said the Supreme Court turned ``traditional First
Amendment analysis on its head'' in a landmark 1969 ruling on the
fairness doctrine.
   In that ruling, the court held that the fairness doctrine did
not violate the First Amendment rights of broadcasters because the
inherent scarcity of broadcast outlets required the government to
regulate broadcasters for the public good.
   Boyd, as did the FCC in its 1987 repeal, said there no longer is
a scarcity of outlets because of cable television and satellite
broadcasting.
   Boyd also noted that the Supreme Court in 1974 overturned a
Florida law that required newspapers to provide space to political
candidates who had been criticized by the newspaper.
   The court at that time said the law was an unconstitutional
intrusion on editors and rejected the argument ``that the actual
scarcity of the print media justified a content-based regulation,''
Boyd wrote.
   Boyd wrote that ``the purpose of the First Amendment is to help
assure that the people are adequately informed about public issues,
not to assure that they are adequately informed by one particular
medium or group of media.''
   Boyd noted that the FCC also said the doctrine ``inhibits
broadcasters from presenting controversial issues'' and therefore
``the public is deprived of a marketplace of ideas unencumbered by
the hand of government. ...''

   Fog and an ocean breeze rolled in over the
coast Monday, ending a sizzling streak of record hot days and
ensuring traditional chilly weather for the Giants home opener at
Candlestick Park.
   Inland, however, parts of the San Joaquin Valley were untouched
by the breeze and temperatures were expected to reach near record
levels again with a high of 97 degrees forecast in Bakersfield.
   Unseasonably hot weather over California has been caused by a
high pressure system between California and Hawaii that held the
storm track to the north, the National Weather Service said.
   Southern California got a breath of fresh air during the weekend
when coastal breezes sent temperatures plunging more than 15
degrees in many areas, ending the hottest April week on record.
Sunday's high in downtown Los Angeles was 76 degrees, a sharp drop
from Saturday's 91 and Thursday's 106, a record high for an April
day.
   San Francisco's forecast for Tuesday predicted morning fog
giving way to sunshine and temperatures in the mid 70s to mid 80s.
The baseball team's home opener was scheduled Tuesday night.
   The San Francisco region's heat wave sent temperatures into the
90s for the fourth straight day Sunday and drove sunbathers to
beaches, shoreside boardwalks and reservoirs. Sunday was the fifth
straight day of record temperatess than $50,000 a year.
   Many businesses complain that the law, by weighting them down
with paperwork, could have the opposite effect by encouraging
abandonment of employee health insurance.

<HEAD>Arab League Rejects US-Endorsed Plan For Palestinian Elections</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs PLO comment after 9th graf pvs, Shamir's plan</HEAD>

   The Arab League rejected on Monday the
U.S.-endorsed Israeli proposal for holding elections among
Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza and said it would send a
delegation here next month to meet with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   Clovis Maksoud, the league's representative here, denounced the
proposal by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir as a device ``to buy more
time for Israel and to diffuse the mounting pressure within the
United States and throughout the world as well as to thwart the
Palestinian uprising.''
   Maksoud, at a news conference, said Shamir was seeking to find
through elections ``a boneless or a toothless Palestinian
negotiator who ratifies his conquest.''
   He said the league delegation would include Farouk Kaddoumi, who
the Palestine Liberation Organization calls its foreign minister,
and ministers from Saudi Arabia and Algeria. Such a session would
be Baker's first meeting with a PLO official.
   ``Shamir ignores the obvious assumption that the PLO is the
Palestinian people and that any search outside its framework means
that negotiations is not a serious or consequential pursuit but
rather an exercise in futility,'' Maksoud said.
   Shamir outlined his proposal last week to President Bush at the
White House and gained the president's endorsement. Shamir and Bush
made statements ruling out an independent Palestinian state in the
territories the Arabs lost to Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.
   ``The plan is totally unacceptable,'' Maksoud said. ``The whole
objective of the Shamir plan is to derail the achievements of the
intefadah (the Arabic word for uprising), to undo what has been
established _ namely the declaration of the Palestinian state _ to
undermine the PLO, to circumvent the international consensus. ...''
   Maksoud met earlier in the day with Paul Hare, the acting deputy
assistant secretary of state for the Near East, and other State
Department officials.
   Shamir's plan has been rejected as well by the PLO.
   In Tunis, Tunisia, the PLO rejected Shamir's proposal. The PLO
news agency, Wafa, said in a dispatch attributed to an unnamed
spokesman:
   ``The idea of elections is totally unacceptable in the shadow of
Israeli occupation and this proposal is nothing but a maneuver
aimed at undermining efforts undertaken by several world powers to
achieve a just settlement in the Middle East.''
   A State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said Yasser
Arafat's organization should ``explore practical ways to advance
the peace process.''
   He declined to say whether the United States had asked the PLO
to endorse Shamir's proposal.
   Israel refuses to negotiate with the PLO, which it holds
accountable for terrorism against the Jewish state. After Arafat
publicly renounced terrorism, the United States dropped its ban on
dealing with the PLO and began talks in Tunisia with PLO officials.
   Shamir's propsal is to have Palestinian leaders elected on the
West Bank and in Gaza to negotiate with Israel self-rule for the
territories for five years, to be followed by negotiations among
Israel, the Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan on a final settlement.
   Maksoud praised Bush for insisting last week on an end to what
the president called Israel's ``occupation'' of the West Bank and
Gaza. The Arab League official said the statement was a positive
one.
   Maksoud said the league's delegation would visit Washington in
mid-May. Presumably he meant after Baker's return from Moscow,
where he will hold talks May 10-11. All 21 Arab countries and the
PLO are members of the Arab League.

   A former news editor at WTSP-Channel 10 was
charged Monday with scheming with a colleague to tap into the
confidential computer system of a competing television station.
   Terry Cole, 32, surrendered at the Hillsborough State Attorney's
office on a conspiracy charge and two counts of computer-related
crimes, said Sam Jones, head of the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement in Tampa.
   Cole was fired in March, along with Michael I. Shapiro, 33,
assistant news director at the ABC affiliate.
   Shapiro was charged with 14 counts of computer-related crimes in
an alleged series of raids on the computer news files of Channel
13, the CBS affiliate. He has been released on his own recognizance
and hasn't come to trial yet.
   When Shapiro was arrested Feb. 7, investigators said they had no
information that anyone else was involved, but since have obtained
evidence that ``Terry Cole took part, had full knowledge, gave his
blessings,'' Jones said Monday.
   Shapiro is a former assignment manager at Channel 13 where he
helped set up security for the computer system.

<TEXT>
   Government troops killed 34 leftist guerrillas
in two jungle clashes in a major counteroffensive in Peru's
nine-year insurgency, officials said Monday.
   Prime Minister Armando Villanueva said the fighting Sunday
marked the start of a drive against Maoist guerrillas in the
cocaine-producing jungle.
   The state news agency Andina said army soldiers battled a column
of Maoist Shining Path guerrillas for six hours near Uchiza, 245
miles northeast of Lima.
   The fighting left 20 rebels dead and three soldiers wounded,
according to a military communique transmitted by Andina.
   The violence came two weeks after a column of rebels and drug
traffickers overran the town's police post, killing 10 policemen
and three civilians.
   Uchiza is in the Upper Huallaga river valley, a region known as
Peru's cocaine cradle. It has become a virtual no-man's land
overrun by drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas who protect them
in exchange for money to purchase arms.
   Fourteen more rebels were slain when navy marines patrolling the
Ucayali River, 180 miles south of Uchiza, battled a guerrilla
column for several hours, Andina said.
   The government did not indicate any troop casualties in that
clash.
   The center-left government of President Alan Garcia has come
under intense criticism since the Uchiza attack for failing to
adequately defend the post and to send reinforcements.
   Critics have renewed charges that the government has mismanaged
the anti-insurgency effort, allowing rebel violence to spread.
   The Shining Path insurgency has claimed more than 14,000 lives,
including guerrillas, soldiers, police and innocent peasants.
   The fighting began in 1980 in the central Andes Mountains and
has branched out to coastal urban centers and the eastern jungle.

   The Bush administration tried Monday to
squelch an effort by members of the House Banking Committee to
weaken the administration's savings and loan reform plan by
diluting a proposal to toughen capital standards.
   A senior Treasury Department official, briefing reporters on the
condition of anonymity, said the committee's proposed capital rule
``has the cosmetic appearance of going in the right direction'' but
would ``undermine the effectiveness of the capital discipline.''
   In reply, a committee aide, also speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the proposal is in some ways tougher, although a
greater number of solvent S&amp;Ls would be able to meet it.
   The aide said a bipartisan majority of the committee supports
the compromise, worked out by staff members in an all-day session
on Saturday.
   Capital represents the interest of an institution's owners. The
more money the owners have at risk before federal deposit insurance
kicks in, the less likely the owners are to make speculative loans.
   A central point in President Bush's S&amp;L package calls for
increasing capital standards from 3 percent of assets currently to
6 percent by June 1991.
   The committee aide said the compromise, supported by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, would
move up the deadline to June 1990, but it would more broadly define
what counts as capital.
   The Treasury official expressed concern that the proposal would
allow a return to the ``bad old days'' of phantom capital and
capital pinned on lax regulatory accounting principles.
   ``The part of it that is most disturbing to us is the definition
of what constitutes capital,'' the official said.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, in a luncheon speech to the Independent
Bankers Association of America, said he opposed the committee
compromise, which he said was advocated by Reps. Frank Annunzio,
D-Ill., and Doug Barnard, D-Ga., because it would have the effect
of lowering the capital standard to 1.5 percent.
   ``The irony is that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's current
standards would be undercut dramatically,'' he told reporters
outside the meeting.
   ``There is a great deal of pressure on the committee to be more
flexible, which means accommodating to the industry, on capital
standards,'' he said. ``My own view is that every time you weaken
the standards, you have the effect of weakening the commitment to
never again.''
   At the Treasury briefing, the official said the department would
support one element of the House proposal _ a laxer standard for
residential mortgages, requiring half as much capital backing as
required for other types of loans.
   ``I think the administration knows that they're going to
probably have to compromise a bit with Congress. My hope is that
Congress isn't too weak in what it tries to push down the
administration's throat,'' Leach said.
   The House Banking subcommittee on financial institutions, which
includes 47 of the full committee's 51 members, is expected to take
up capital rules at its second public session on the S&amp;L bill,
scheduled Tuesday.
   In another development, four consumer and community groups
circulated a letter Monday to committee members threatening to
oppose the S&amp;L legislation unless it contains amendments
discouraging institutions from discrimination based on sex and race
and encouraging lending for housing for low- and moderate-income
people.
   ``We will oppose this legislation unless all these are
responsibly addressed in the bill,'' leaders of the four groups
wrote. ``Remember, the public is paying a price tag of more than
$200 billion, and therefore must be assured that it will never
again have to sign a blank check.''
   The groups are the Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of
America, Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now
(ACORN), and the Center for Community Change.

<HEAD>Jewish Leader Says Crosses Erected at Disputed Convent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carmelite nuns living at the site of the Nazi death
camp at Auschwitz in Poland have erected crosses at their disputed
convent, the head of France's Jewish community disclosed Monday.
   In a letter of protest to French Roman Catholic Cardinal Albert
Decourtray, Theo Klein said three crosses have been erected at the
convent of Carmelite nuns, a building used by the Nazis as a
warehouse during World War II to store the deadly Zyklon B gas.
   Klein, president of the Representative Council of French Jewish
Organizations, was, along with Decourtray, among the signatories to
a 1987 agreement for the convent to moved from the site by February
1989.
   The letter, dated April 6, was made public in Washington by the
World Jewish Congress.
   ``A 23-foot cross has gone up on top of the largest Jewish
graveyard in the world,'' Elan Steinberg, Executive Director of the
congress, said in Washington. ``This will further harm already
strained relations with the Vatican.''
   The erection of the crosses marks the latest episode in a bitter
clash between Jewish leaders and the Vatican over the presence of a
dozen nuns on the site that has become a memorial to the 6 million
Jews murdered by the Nazis.
   In Paris, Klein told The Associated Press the letter was the
most recent in a series of exchanges over the crosses.
   ``There's one on the building, another wooden one on a place
called the `Way of the Cross' and a third, smaller one on the gate
next to three stars of David,'' Klein said in a telephone interview.
   He said the erection of crosses contradicted assurances he
received earlier this year from Polish Catholic authorities that
the nuns had agreed to move from the convent, founded in 1984 as a
center for prayer and meditation.
   People returning from recent visits to Auschwitz were ``very
shocked to see that the very nuns who were supposedly getting ready
to move from the convent were, in fact, getting ready to settle in
permanently,'' Klein said.
   Under the 1987 agreement, signed by representatives of the
Vatican and Jewish leaders, the convent was to be moved to another
site by Feb. 22, 1989.
   Decourtray said in February he would urge the nuns be moved to
temporary housing if new quarters were not ready by July 22. Klein
has urged that the nuns be moved before July.
   The nuns have agreed to go once a new convent is ready.
   In Washington, Steinberg said the World Jewish Congress was
informed by a French Jewish delegation that the nuns had undertaken
improvements in the building they occupy and added the cross since
another delegation visited the site last December.

<HEAD>Murder Trial of Christian Scientist Couple Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Christian Scientist couple whose
7-year-old daughter died of diabetes went on trial on murder
charges Monday in a test of a state law legally absolving parents
when religious beliefs prohibit medical care.
   Nine potential jurors were excused in the trial of William
Hermanson, 42, and his 38-year-old wife, Christine, on charges of
third-degree murder and child abuse in the death 2{ years ago of
their daughter, Amy.
   If convicted, the Hermansons face three to seven years in prison.
   State Circuit Judge Steven Dakan took under consideration a
defense motion to move the trial out of Sarasota County on grounds
of excessive pretrial publicity. He said he wanted to see if a fair
and impartial panel could be chosen in the Hermansons' hometown
before ruling.
   Jurors will be asked to weigh legal and moral questions about
the balance between religious freedom and children's rights.
   The case challenges a 1975 law absolving parents of abuse or
neglect charges when they deny their children medical care because
of deep religious beliefs.
   Defense attorney Thomas Dart said the law excludes people like
the Hermansons from criminal charges, but prosecutors say the law
should not shield parents who let their children die.
   The Hermansons refused a plea bargain, under which they would
have served 15 years probation in return for pleading guilty or no
contest, for a chance to have their case heard by jury.
   Hermanson worked as a bank vice president and his wife ran a
fine arts academy. They have another child, Eric, 11.
   A cornerstone of Christian Science doctrine is the reliance on
prayer instead of medicine to care for the ill. In difficult cases,
they may seek help from ``practitioners,'' senior church members
with expertise in spiritual healing. However, individuals may seek
medical assistance without fear of church sanctions.
   Amy became ill in September 1986, and the Hermansons called on
two such practitioners, authorities said. She died Sept. 30. After
the girl died, a medical examiner concluded that medical treatment
probably could have saved her.

   The government asked the judge in Oliver
North's trial Monday to deny North's request for surveillance
records on foreigners involved in negotiations to free U.S.
hostages.
   The Justice Department said North's attempt near the end of the
trial to subpoena the records was calculated to ``graymail the
United States'' by threatening disclosure of secrets to force
dismissal of the charges.
   ``This is a last-ditch effort to use classified information as a
weapon rather than as proof,'' said the department, which also
filed under court seal an affidavit by Mary C. Lawton, counsel for
intelligence policy.
   ``The information sought receives the highest protection under
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and the harm to national
security of disclosure of this information would be enormous,'' the
department said in papers filed by Assistant Attorney General
Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., head of the criminal division.
   As an alternative to furnishing records of the surveillances,
the department proposed a stipulation of facts about eavesdropping
by intelligence agencies approved by the secret Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court.
   The stipulation document included an indication that Iranian
arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar was among those who were the
object of surveillances conducted in Washington by unnamed
intelligence agencies.
   The Justice Department said surveillances were conducted between
Oct. 1985 and September 1986 of several foreigners _ none named _
at the request of then-CIA Director William Casey.
   Included were ``several foreign nationals who purported to be,
or have direct access to, representatives of the government of
Iran,'' according to the proposed stipulation.
   ``The surveillances related to negotiations concerning the
release of American hostages in Lebanon,'' the document said.
   On Oct. 7, 1985, the department, with the authorization of
then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III, sought court approval for
surveillance of two foreigners, the document said.
   The next day, North met in Washington with Ghorbanifar as well
as Israeli arms dealers Al Schwimmer and Yaacov Nimrodi, according
to the report of the presidential commission headed by former Sen.
John Tower.
   Another surveillance of ``one of the same two individuals'' was
approved on April 2, 1986.
   On the next day, North and CIA consultant George Cave met in
Washington with Ghorbanifar, according to the Tower report.
   The meetings, which continued April 4, 1986, involved
discussions about the forthcoming mission to Tehran led by North
and former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane.
   The Justice Department document also detailed another round of
surveillances approved by Meese in September 1986.
   These surveillances coincided with meetings North and Cave had
in Washington with representatives of an Iranian group that
reportedly included the son of Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of
Iran's parliament.

   Oliver North, seemingly struggling to keep his
temper, on Monday defended his stewardship of an Iran-Contra cash
fund and insisted the money he paid for a used car came instead
from a $15,000 family cache in a metal box bolted to a closet floor.
   In North's third day as a witness, a contentious one, prosecutor
John Keker tried to show that North dipped into the fund, arranged
for $200,000 in free life insurance, allowed his colleagues to make
huge profits on Iran-Contra dealings, and accepted a free security
fence.
   At the start of cross examination at his trial, North said he
kept track in a spiral-bound notebook of every penny he disbursed
from the Iran-Contra fund which totaled between $240,000 and
$300,000.
   ``The ledger is still around?'' asked prosecutor John Keker.
   ``It was destroyed,'' North said.
   ``Do you know who destroyed it?''
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``I did.''
   Later, Keker asked whether North was nervous about destroying
the ledger. North said not, because ``I couldn't believe I could
ever be accused of doing anything dishonest with that money.''
   In quick succession, Keker touched on other charges and North
fired back answers.
   _ On the $13,800 security system installed at his home, paid for
by co-defendant Richard Secord: ``To this day, I don't know exactly
who or how that security system was paid for. ... I did intend to
pay for it.''
   _ On a $200,000 insurance fund set up for North's family by
Iran-Contra moneyman Albert Hakim: Asked if he knew Hakim is
charged with bribing him, North said, ``He is not guilty of it,
because Mr. Hakim did not try to bribe me.''
   _ On profits by Secord and Hakim: Keker asked if he knew whether
Secord made ``a few hundred thousands or millions'' and North said
he didn't know. But, he added, ``I believed then and I believe
today General Secord was taking fair and just compensation for the
many hours he was putting in.''
   Keker asked North if, ``in fact everybody was taking a piece''
of the money involved?
   ``No, that is not so,'' said North. ``You are talking to one who
didn't.''
   North said he was angry at the government, ``having been fairly
well trashed,'' at the time he wrote two back-dated letters in
December 1986 to make it appear he was going to pay for the
security system. ``It has to be one of the dumbest things I have
done in my life,'' he said.
   He wrote the letters after he was fired from his National
Security Council job and threatened with becoming the target of a
criminal investigation.
   Meanwhile, the government asked the judge in North's trial to
deny his request for surveillance records on foreigners involved in
negotiations to free U.S. hostages.
   The Justice Department said North's attempt near the end of the
trial to subpoena the records was calculated to ``graymail the
United States'' by threatening disclosure of secrets to force
dismissal of the charges.
   Earlier Monday, North testified that former President Reagan and
his attorney general, Edwin Meese III, concealed U.S. involvement
in a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran.
   In a meeting on Nov. 12, 1986, Reagan clearly ``had made a
decision not to disclose'' the shipment, North said.
   The president told a news conference on Nov. 19 _ a week after
that meeting _ that the government had not been involved with other
nations in shipping weapons to Iran and that the United States had
shipped none before he signed a January 1986 authorizing document.
Immediately afterward, the White House put out a statement in which
Reagan said a third country had been involved.
   North testified that he assumed Reagan had known of the
diversion of Iran arms sale funds to the Contras, a contention
Reagan has denied.
   North said he shredded the financial accounting notebook, page
by page, on orders of the late CIA Director William Casey, because
it had names and addresses of people whose lives would be in danger
were they to become public. The shredding took place, he said, in
late 1986 when the Iran-Contra affair began to unravel.
   Keker intimated that the $8,038 paid for North's car, a
Chevrolet Suburban with 51,000 miles, came from the
North-administered fund established to pay the expenses of
Nicaraguan rebel leaders when they were in this country and to
support the Iran initiative.
   There had been previous testimony that rebel leader Adolfo
Calero put $90,000 to $100,000 in traveler's checks into the fund
and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Secord put in $150,000 to $200,000
cash.
   ``Do you remember being tempted to use the traveler's checks for
your personal use?''
   ``Never once,'' North shot back.
   North is accused of converting $4,300 of those checks to his own
use, although not in connection with the used car.
   He said that in 1985 he earned about $50,000 from the Marine
Corps, where he was a lieutenant colonel, and also had some income
from investments and dividends.
   ``We had a yard sale or two, and I think my wife sold some
puppies,'' he said. ``We always lived on our budget, we always were
very frugal.''
   Asked where the money came from to buy the car, North said it
came out of the family fund which he started in 1967 with an
insurance settlement from an automobile accident. He said when he
came home at night, he would throw his change into that box.
   ``The change out of your pocket grew to $15,000 in your house?''
Keker asked. North said yes.
   In November 1986, two days after he said he had told Meese
details of the Hawk missile shipment, he heard Meese say at a news
conference that the Israelis had made the 1985 shipment without
U.S. involvement.
   Meese gave ``a whole series of answers'' that were
``inconsistent with what I had told him,''said North. ``It made me
wonder whether I had talked to the attorney general.''
   One of the 12 felony charges against North is that he lied to
Meese during their meeting.
   He is also charged with lying to Congress, destroying or
falsifying government documents and accepting an illegal gratuity.

   The Navy has performed a medical statistical

   Navy News and Undersea Technology, the publication, said the
study had been criticized by one outside researcher as utilizing
procedures that were bound to be biased in the Navy's favor.
   Nonetheless, the study suggests a 37 percent difference between
cancer rates for the general population and sailors aboard nuclear
missile submarines.
   The publication said the statistical tabulation reported an
``observed'' rate of cancer cases among missile submarine personnel
of 54, compared to an ``expected'' rate for the general population
of 39.4.
   The Navy declined immediate comment on Monday, saying it hoped
to release a statement on the matter Tuesday.
   The study was originally requested in 1974 by Rep. Pat
Schroeder, D-Colo.,

   America's newspapers and radio and television
stations discriminate against women in pay, promotions and news
coverage, a study released Monday at a conference on ``Women, Men
and Media'' said.
   ``Media coverage of and by women is inexcusably poor,'' Junior
Bridge, a Washington media consultant, told delegates to the
conference sponsored by the Gannett Foundation.
   The study, financed largely by the foundation, showed that 6
percent of news media jobs as publisher, president or vice
president are held by women. The share was 6 percent for
newspapers, 3 percent for television and 8 percent for radio.
   It said women in media earn less than two-thirds as much as men,
64 cents for every dollar paid to a male employe. Comparing women
and men, the study said women average $9,074 less per year in
television, $7,793 less on newspapers and $3,323 less in radio.
   Jean Gaddy Wilson of the University of Missouri, who conducted
the study of hiring and promotion, said the survey covered 1,599
daily newspapers, l,219 television stations and 1,091 radio
stations.
   John Seigenthaler, editor of The Nashville Tennesseean and
president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, asked to
comment on the report, said, ``It's a cliche to talk about a
comfort level, and that good old boys are more comfortable with
good old boys than they are with anybody else, but I am afraid that
those numbers document that.''
   ``Until a majority of the papers begin to insist that something
be done about the comfort level of good old boys like me, we are
not going to make the sort of progress that justice requires,'' he
said.
   Officials of the Radio and Television News Directors Association
were away from their office and not available to comment, an
employe in the office said.
   The study of television and newspaper coverage was conducted by
Ms. Bridge and Kathy Bonk, co-director of Communications
Consortium, a self-described public interest media center based in
Washington.
   It showed that on the three major nightly television news
programs during February, 15.8 percent of the stories were reported
by women.
   In 10 newspapers, 27 percent of the bylines on the front pages
in March were female, 11 percent of the people quoted were female
and 24 percent of the photographs included women. Unlike the men,
the women usually appeared in group shots with family members.
   By averaging where the papers ranked in the three categories,
the study rated USA TODAY, Gannett's Washington-based national
newspaper, as ``best'' with 41 percent of its front-page bylines
female and with women in 41 percent of its front-page pictures.
There were references to women by name in 21 percent of the paper's
front-page stories.
   The New York Times rated ``worst,'' with women getting 16 per
cent of front-page bylines and appearing in 16 percent of
front-page photographs. Women were referred to by name in 5 percent
of front-page stories.
   The Houston Chronicle and Atlanta Constitution tied for second,
followed in order by the Seattle Times, Washington Post, Los
Angeles Times, Miami Herald, St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Chicago
Tribune.
   The study said 25 percent of newspaper news staffs are women,
while 75 percent of the business office staffs are women. In
television, women account for 32 percent of the news staffs and 77
percent of the business staffs. In radio, the figures are 34
percent for news and 83 percent for television.
   The study of television networks showed that women reported 22.2
percent of the stories on the CBS Evening News in February, 14.4
percent of the stories on the corresponding NBC program and 10.5
percent on ABC.
   It also said that 13.7 percent of the ABC stories, 10.2 percent
of the CBS stories and 8.9 percent of the NBC stories focused on
women as their subject.
   Diana Meehan, director of the Institute for the Study of Men and
Women at the University of Southern California, said she is making
a study of women executives in television and has found that the 30
highest-ranking ones all were the firstborn or only child in their
families.
   In addition, she said, they are all from families that ``had
some wordly success,'' all broke into the business as writers and
all attended universities in the Midwest or in New York, not Ivy
League schools. By comparison, she said, top male executives often
have attended Ivy League schools and broke into television by some
route other than writing.

   A woman's right to become pregnant in a
test-tube baby procedure should outweigh her estranged husband's
decision not to become a father, the woman's attorney said Monday.
   Mary Sue Davis, 28, and Junior Lewis Davis, 30, are getting a
divorce and are at odds over what to do with seven of her eggs that
are fertilized with his sperm and kept in frozen storage.
   Davis, who filed a divorce petition in February, referred to the
embryos as ``property jointly owned'' and said he doesn't want Mrs.
Davis to become pregnant with them.
   Mrs. Davis considers the matter a custody battle and has said
the embryos are life that should be taken to term by being
implanted inside her.
   The Blount County, Tenn., couple have participated in an
in-vitro fertilization program in Knoxville for six years in an
effort to become parents.
   The two were married in 1979. Mrs. Davis said she had had five
tubal pregnancies, resulting in the rupture of one fallopian tube
and surgery to tie the other, by the time she and her husband began
the in-vitro fertilization program.
   Mrs. Davis' attorney, J.G. Christenberry, said in an interview
that because a woman can do more for the eggs _ produce a child _
than a man can, her wants should outweigh his when issues such as
this arise.
   Christenberry said he hoped the Blount County Circuit Court case
could be heard by July. In a two-page court response filed last
week, he said Mrs. Davis maintains ``she is the proper party to be
awarded the custody of her embryos for her exclusive use.''
   The Davises acknowledge that the case is an unusual one
incorporating medical technology, personal rights and ethics, and
that there apparently are no previous court cases like it.
   Many in-vitro fertilization clinics require couples to sign
written agreements regarding the fate of their frozen embryos in
the event of the man and woman's death or divorce. However, medical
officials have conceded it's hard to draft consent forms that
include every possible scenario for embryos.
   The Davises said they were not asked to sign such a paper.
   Dr. I. Ray King, founder of the clinic in Knoxville, has said
that was an oversight. But he added that any such agreement
probably could be contested legally later by a husband or wife who
changed his or her mind.
   King has agreed to continue maintaining the seven frozen, viable
embryos.

   The odds that Congress will approve oil
drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge dropped Monday as a
congressman whose subcommittee oversees the Alaska pipeline blasted
the industry's ability to clean up after itself.
   ``It is clear that what happened in Prince William Sound was not
a simple accident,'' said Rep. George Miller, following a three-day
visit to Alaska to see the effects of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker
accident.
   ``Rather, it was the tragic result of a systematic assault by
the oil industry that rendered ineffective the entire system of
regulatory safeguards,'' the California Democrat told a press
conference.
   He said it would irresponsible to allow lease sales in the
refuge after seeing the ineffectiveness of Exxon in dealing with
its 10 million gallon spill into one of the nation's most
environmentally delicate areas.
   Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., chairman of the Interior Committee,
agreed that legislation to allow oil lease sales in the refuge is
dead this year, but he would not rule out its passage next year.
   Reacting to the nation's largest oil spill, legislators began
expressing doubts about the ANWR legislation last week and, as the
oil continues to spread, are growing increasingly disappointed with
Exxon and others who are connected with clean-up efforts.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., whose Committee on Energy and
Natural Resources approved the ANWR bill last month, said after the
spill that he could not tell right away what the impact would be.
But a few days later, he said he would not push the bill for a full
Senate vote until safety systems were in place.
   Rep. Bill Richards, D-N.M., supported ANWR drilling before the
oil spill but said he has changed his mind.
   The House subcommittee on national parks and public lands
announced a hearing Thursday to find out what the National Park
Service is doing to clean up oil that reached the Kenai Fjords
National Park on Monday and was on its way to the Katmai and Lake
Clark national parks.
   Miller said the spill ``requires us to completely re-evaluate
our the system of delivery.''
   he oil tanker ran aground March 24 and the spill is still not
under control.
   Miller said the industry had promised that it could handle any
problems connected with oil shipping, but over the years stripped
away the safeguards for cost-cutting purposes.
   He said an authority that could command cleanup after an
accident like that last month should be established.
   ``We have to separate those that are looking out for the public
and those looking out for the industry,'' he said. ``I want a
system by which the first thing the industry does is clean up the
oil in the water and not call their lawyers.'''
   At least one congressional subcommittee is planning to look into
the increases in retail gasoline prices that have occurred since
the grounding of the oil tanker.
   The Energy Committee's energy regulation and conservation
subcommittee, chaired by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has
planned a hearing for next Monday, said the panel's counsel, Joel
Saltzman. The lawmaker has invited industry and government
officials, along with consumer advocates, to testify.
   Since the accident, oil industry analysts have noted increases
of about a dime per gallon in the prices motorists pay for gasoline.
   They have attributed the higher prices not only to the spill and
the temporary shutdown of the pipeline, but to tight international
supplies, an unusually high proportion of U.S. refineries
undergoing maintenance, the costs of complying with nw federal
restrictions on fuel ingredients, and the usual run-up in prices
with the approach of the summer driving season.

   Troops fired in the air to disperse a rally in
Georgia Monday, and the Kremlin sent Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze to try to end a week of ethnic unrest in his southern
homeland that killed at least 18 people.
   A general strike closed schools, mass transit and some
businesses in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital of 1.2 million people
900 miles southeast of Moscow, residents said.
   The government has sent in troops and tanks to quell ethnic
strife and pro-independence movements in the mountainous Caucasus
republic, the nation's vegetable and fruit basket and birthplace of
dictator Josef Stalin.
   Public gatherings were banned, an 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew was
imposed and soldiers patrolled in tanks and armored personnel
carriers, but the unrest continued Monday with a rally at Tbilisi
State University.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov confirmed two
additional deaths from Sunday's clash between troops and
nationalist protesters, raising the toll to 18. Officials said 100
people were injured.
   Shevardnadze, sent to Georgia by the ruling Politburo, is a
Georgian who showed some sympathy to nationalists while serving as
Georgia's Communist Party chief from 1972-85.
   As party chief, Shevardnadze repeatedly called for mutual
respect and tolerance between Georgians and ethnic Abkhazians, a
minority living in the western part of the republic. In 1978, he
supported a law making Georgian the republic's official language, a
demand of nationalists.
   The republic's current party leader, Djhumber Patiashvili, said
Monday on the evening television news program ``Vremya'' that ``no
one expected fatalities'' when troops armed only with clubs and
shields were ordered to clear demonstrators from the main street of
Tbilisi early Sunday. But he took responsibility for the tragedy.
   ``After the troops started to act, they didn't retreat. And then
the unpredictable happened,'' he said. ``The troops didn't back
off, and unfortunately, innocent people who were not active
participants in the demonstration died.
   ``Unfortunately, the leaders immediately fled, and not one of
them was scratched.''
   He said that although fatalities came as a surprise, ``it
happened, and we share a common grief, for which we are answering.''
   A column of cars carrying flags of mourning moved through
Tbilisi Monday with horns honking and headlights shining, the
government newspaper Izvestia reported. Some residents donned black
ribbons, residents said. Tuesday was officially declared a day of
mourning.
   Ethnic unrest has wracked several of the 15 Soviet republics as
the Soviet Union's more than 100 national groups take advantage of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of openness to vent long
pent-up complaints of discrimination and official insensitivity to
local needs. Last November, troops and tanks were sent to Armenia
and Azerbaijan to quell unrest that killed more than 90 people.
Mass demonstrations have swept the three Baltic republics.
   The U.S. State Department on Monday supported the Georgia
demonstrations and asked authorities to use restraint in dealing
with peaceful protests. ``What is at issue here is peaceful
political expression,'' said spokesman Richard Boucher. ``We
certainly support them in that.''
   Nana Byelovami, a nurse at Central Republic Hospital in Tbilisi,
said a 23-year-old pregnant woman who was beaten and a 50-year-old
woman who inhaled tear gas died late Sunday.
   Gerasimov confirmed 18 people had died and said the original 16
victims included 10 women and six men, all civilians who were
trampled when soldiers broke up the protest.
   Patiashvili denied reports that soldiers moved into the crowd
without warning, saying authorities persuaded Georgian Catholic
Church leader Ilya II to ask demonstrators to go home at 3:15 a.m.
Sunday.
   ``He came, and asked, and begged,'' Patiashvili said.
   He said armored personnel carriers were moved up in a show of
force _ ``Unfortunately, this did not cool them down, but had the
opposite effect.'' A commission is investigating, he said.
   As many as 1,000 people massed at the university Monday, said
Zurab Zhankarashvili, a member of the Helsinki Watch group who was
at the gathering.
   ``The military stood there with their tanks and frightened the
people off. They shot in the air.''
   Sergei Dandurov, a nationalist activist who attended the
meeting, said troops jumped from armored personnel carriers and
began firing in the air. The crowd scattered, with some people
fleeing into a university building, he said.
   Zhankarashvili said soldiers beat two students. The troops
prevented further demonstrations.
   ``As soon as a group gathers, they come and break it up,''
Zhankarashvili said.
   Shevardnadze, 61, arrived in Tbilisi over the weekend, residents
said. Tass said he met Monday with Georgian intellectuals and news
media officials.
   Tass said Shevardnadze and candidate Politburo member Georgy P.
Razumovsky attended a meeting of local party leaders who called the
situation throughout Georgia ``extremely tense.'' It said the
leaders called on party and government officials and plant managers
to reject the protesters' demands and ``direct all efforts at
stabilizing the situation.''
   On April 4, some demonstrators began protesting calls from
Abkhazians to break away from the republic because of alleged
discrimination by Georgians. Others demanded Georgia secede from
the Soviet Union because of alleged interference by Moscow in their
political, economic and cultural affairs.
   By Friday the crowd numbered 100,000, according to nationalist
estimates; a general strike was called, and troops and tanks sent
in.
   Georgian activists called for the strike to continue Monday.
Reports conflicted about the strike's effectiveness in the capital.
   ``No one is going to work,'' said Nokri Dzhangarashvili, a
student.
   ``Everyone but doctors and breadmakers are on strike,'' said a
visitor at the central hospital who refused to give his name.
``There is no transport. All stores are closed except food stores.
Factories are closed.''
   Gerasimov said most businesses in Tbilisi were operating but
some opened late because of disrupted public transport. He
confirmed that colleges were closed because of the strike.
   Police arrested at least six prominent Georgian activists over
the weekend and sought 30 others, said Nanuli Gogua, whose daughter
Irina Sarishvili was among those taken into custody by the KGB
security force.
   The Foreign Ministry said Tbilisi was closed to foreign
correspondents and to any Soviets reporting for Western news
organizations.

   More than two weeks of efforts to clean up
the nation's largest oil spill has created another headache for
those in charge: a mountain of oily garbage.
   The cleanup has started to accumulate uncounted amounts of
absorbant pads, oiled clothing, trash bags and even a trailer full
of dead birds and otters.
   ``We're still in the process of developing the numbers,'' said
Bob Lewis, a solid waste expert with Exxon environmental group.
   Much of the waste is in the form of pads used to absorb oil in
the water and along the shoreline. The pads, similar in material to
disposable diapers, are being collected at cleanup sites in Prince
William Sound.
   When the cleanup of the sound's shoreline gets under way it will
produce tons of the oily plastic and paper, authorities said.
   Officials are also faced with the disposal of hundreds of birds
and otters collected in the sound. As of Monday, there were a
reported 835 dead birds and 134 dead sea otters.
   Many of the bodies are stored in a refrigerated truck parked
behind the Valdez courthouse. The truck is not yet filled, but more
animals are being brought in every day.
   The present plan is to burn the waste in portable incinerators.
Bill Lamoreaux, the state's on-scene coordinator, said some
experimental burning has already taken place.
   Lewis said the incinerators, which use heating oil to fire the
garbage, may be placed in strategic locations around the sound.
   ``We have small ones the size of a truck that are fairly
portable,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Last week's agreement in principle on
agricultural trade included language acceptable to the European
Economic Community and did not represent a cave-in by U.S.
negotiators, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Monday.
   The EEC had balked at the earlier U.S. insistence that all
trade-distorting agricultural subsidies be eliminated over the long
haul. The agreement reached in Geneva last week by more than 100
countries calls for a ``substantial progressive reduction'' in such
subsidies.
   Yeutter, in an interview with a group of reporters, said the
Europeans had objected to earlier language calling for the
``elimination'' of the subsidies and later to a modified
``ratcheting'' down of them.
   Asked if the final language represented backtracking on the part
of the United States in its quest to do away eventually with
trade-distorting subsidies and other practices, Yeutter replied:
``I don't consider it backtracking at all.''
   Indeed, he said, there is no practical difference between
``elimination'' or ``racheting'' or the accepted ``substantial
progressive reduction'' of subsidies, regardless of what some
European leaders may feel.
   ``They may have their own reasons for articulating the outcome
of the meeting as they have,'' Yeutter said. ``Obviously, everyone
will go home and, to some degree, at least, articulate their own
interpretation in a way that fits their own particular needs.''
   The accord provides a framework for further discussions under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a four-year effort
called the Uruguay Round of talks to liberalize global trade. The
current GATT round will conclude at the end of 1990.
   As part of the Geneva agreement, participants agreed to an
overall freeze on farm supports and import barriers through 1990.
   Yeutter said the U.S. goal is to gain long-term accord on the
future of agricultural trade and that the short-term agreement
reached in Geneva, while acceptable, was no big challenge for U.S.
negotiators.
   Some American farm leaders, including Dean Kleckner of the
American Farm Bureau Federation, had urged Congress to proceed
writing a new general farm bill on an assumption that little
progress could be expected under the GATT talks.
   Yeutter said he had no objection to Congress proceeding with a
new farm bill to replace the 1985 law that will expire next year.
And Yeutter denied that he had favored going slow on legislation
until it was clearer how the GATT talks would shape up.
   ``Somehow that got misinterpreted ... because that's not really
what I meant at all,'' Yeutter said.
   ``Assuming that (GATT) negotiations are a success, the 1990 farm
legislation will have to be modified accordingly in 1991,'' he
said. ``But I never meant to indicate that we shouldn't have
full-scale farm legislation in 1990.''
   On the matter of U.S. export subsidies used in the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP, Yeutter said it was ``our view that we
are not constrained on EEP expenditures.''
   Yeutter said further that he still favors Congress removing the
lid on EEP spending so that the United States can match the
unrestrained export subsidies of the Europeans. The program, he
said, was a major factor in reaching an aggreement in Geneva last
week.

   Yang Jing's hands quivered as the dissident tried
Monday to readjust to the strangeness of just sitting in a coffee
shop and talking. He was released from prison three days ago.
   ``I'm not used to it,'' he said with a shy smile as he
chain-smoked.
   Yang, 42, was arrested April 8, 1981, at a friend's house
discussing ways to stop officials from shutting down the April
Fifth Forum _ one of the most widely known underground journals of
the 1978-79 Democracy Wall Movement.
   He was accused of spying and sentenced to eight years at
Beijing's No. 1 Prison, where for 10 months he was confined to a
6-foot-square cell.
   On Saturday, eight years later to the day, he returned to his
family, including an 8-year-old son born after his arrest. His wife
had told the youngster his father was on a research project at the
South Pole.
   It is a fractured family, Yang said. His father died in February
and one brother has not forgiven him for being imprisoned and
refused to come to his welcome-home dinner.
   Yang, in an interview with The Associated Press, said his goal
now is to rebuild his life without politics or controversy.
Although he has completed his prison term, his political rights
remain suspended for three years.
   ``I will try to live quietly, maybe painting,'' he said. ``I
want to take care of my health.''
   Yang said his muscles have wasted away and he lost at least 10
pounds while in jail. His tan slacks and blue worker's jacket,
saved from before he went to prison, were loose on his slight frame.
   Yang left behind in the No. 1 Prison another editor of the April
Fifth Forum, Xu Wenli, who was arrested two days after Yang and
sentenced to 15 years. Xu has been kept apart from most of the
other prisoners and barred from having visitors since 1985.
   A third editor of the monthly journal, Liu Qing, is scheduled to
be released from a jail in north-central China in November.
   The group began publishing the April Fifth Forum in their homes
during the Democracy Wall Movement, named after a wall in Beijing
where hundreds of people put up posters in 1978-79 calling for
reform of the Communist Party's authoritarian rule.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, then newly established in power and
struggling with conservatives, initially gave the activists
approval. But after consolidating power he halted the poster
activity and police began arresting leaders of the movement.
   ``I think the country needed'' Democracy Wall, Yang said. ``I
think the magazine really made a contribution. Although we were
arrested, step by step many of our demands were later adopted by
the authorities.
   ``For example, we suggested people have the right to information
about government and the economy, the right of supervision. To some
degree this is being carried out. Of course it is lacking in many
ways, but things are going in the right direction.''
   More than two dozen Democracy Wall activists remain in prison,
with several due for release in the next two years.
   More than 100 intellectuals in China, 24,000 people in Hong Kong
and hundreds of Chinese in Taiwan and the United States have signed
petitions in the past two months calling for an amnesty for all
political prisoners.
   In 1982, Yang was caught slipping a note to a fellow prisoner
and was placed for 10 months in a special cell called ``The Little
Number'' because it was only six feet wide and six feet long with
the light always on, Yang said.
   He said he kept track of the passage of days because guards gave
him the official party newspaper, the People's Daily, each day to
study.
   Beginning in 1987 treatment improved, he said. Life settled into
a quiet routine in which he worked in a plastic sandals factory and
tried to spend little time thinking about freedom.
   He was allowed to leave the prison twice this year _ to see his
dying father in the hospital and to attend the funeral. His wife
could visit him occasionally.
   Since his release Yang spent most of the time in the family's
two-room home on a narrow alley in western Beijing. But his younger
brother gave him tickets to a movie.
   ``It turned out to be about spies and jail and how to escape
from jail,'' Yang said with a wide grin.

<HEAD>Reformer Elected in Montenegro Presidential Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nenad Bucin, a popular advocate of
economic and political reforms, was declared the winner Monday in
elections for Montenegro's representative on Yugoslavia's
collective presidency, Belgrade radio said.
   Preliminary results indicated Bucin, who ran against a retired
army officer and a career politician, won 171,047 of the 310,000
votes cast in the republic's 20 counties.
   He is scheduled to be formally approved by Montenegro's
Parliament as the republic's representative on the national
presidency next Friday.
   The nine-member federal presidency includes representatives of
Yugoslavia's six republics, its two autonomous provinces and the
head of the Communist Party.
   The balloting Sunday was the first-ever Western-style free
election in Montenegro, the smallest of the republics, and only the
second in communist Yugoslavia.
   In the other republics, representatives are nominated by the
regional leaderships and rubber-stamped by the legislatures.
   Janez Drnovsek, a 39-year-old economist virtually unknown in the
rest of the country, was elected April 2 to represent the liberal
republic of Slovenia on the federal presidency.
   Drnovsek is scheduled to take over as the country's president in
mid-May. Presidency members rotate every year as head of the body.
   Bucin, 54, an outspoken member of the communist leadership, has
frequently stressed the need for fundamental market-oriented
economic reforms and for changes in the political system that would
give ordinary citizens a greater say in the political process.

   Syrian and Druse gunners fired rocket
barrages onto Christian beaches Monday in what police called a
rehearsal for shelling French aid ships expected to arrive this
week.
   France is sending two ships loaded with fuel, medical and food
supplies to help ease shortages caused by a month of the worst
sectarian fighting since 1985.
   Newspapers say the ships are due Wednesday, and Moslems say the
former colonial power is biased toward the Christians.
   France says the aid is destined for all Lebanese. A French envoy
to Lebanon was quoted as saying Syrian gunfire against the aid
ships ``would be an act of war against France, against humanity,
against an emergency humanitarian action.''
   ``If they fire, it is clear that they want to destroy Lebanon,''
Jean-Francois Deniau, home from a two-day mission to Lebanon, was
quoted as saying in the French daily newspaper La Nouvelle
Republique du Centre-Ouest, of Tours. He added he did not believe
that would happen.
   Christian army units led by Gen. Michel Aoun responded to
Monday's rocket fire with 155mm howitzers, shelling the Ein
Mreisseh and Wadi Abu Jamil neighborhoods of Moslem west Beirut.
   Police reported two people killed and 15 wounded in west Beirut.
They said the fire was directed at Syrian rocket launchers in the
two districts and at the Murr tower, a unfinished 40-story building
the Syrians use as a sniping and observation post.
   Monday's exchanges violated a cease-fire proclaimed by the Arab
League, which began at midnight Wednesday.
   A police spokesman said a shell hit a Turkish cargo ship
carrying 2,200 tons of flour Sunday night off Jounieh, a Christian
port north of Beirut, killing one of its 12 crew members and
damaging the vessel.
   West Beirut press reports said an army gunboat fired on the
Mololi because it was taking flour to Sidon, a Moslem-controlled
port in the south. The ship left Lebanese waters after the attack
for Famagusta, Cyprus, said the police spokesman, who cannot be
named under standing regulations.
   Artillery duels betweeen Aoun's 20,000 Christian troopers and an
alliance of Syrian soldiers and Druse militiamen began March 8, two
days after Aoun's forces blockaded illegal ports run by militias.
   According to police figures, 180 people have been killed and 619
wounded, nearly all of them civilians.
   Mitri Nammar, head of the Beirut electricity authority, said the
main city power plant at Zouk, a suburb of Christian east Beirut,
was out of fuel and ``unless something is urgently done ... the
one-hour daily supply of electricity to the capital and its
environs will stop.''
   Syrian and Druse gunners regularly fire at the Zouk beach,
preventing fuel tankers from docking there.
   French Ambassador Paul Blanc visited Moslem west Beirut and met
with Salah Staitieh of the Moslem government's Foreign Ministry. A
crisis that began in September has created competing Christian and
Moslem governments _ led by Aoun and Premier Salim Hoss, a Sunni
Moslem _ and divided the army.
   Staitieh said he told Blanc the Moslem cabinet ``is moving
toward rejecting the French relief aid. In this case, let France
give all these supplies to the other party with whom it
sympathizes.''
   Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib's 22,000-man Moslem army suggested in a
statement that the French vessels dock in the northern port of
Tripoli ``to ensure the safety of the two ships and their crew.''
Moslems control Tripoli.
   Police say bombardment of the beaches near the Zouk power plant
and the Christian port of Jounieh north of Beirut has been a
rehearsal for arrival of the ships sent by France, from which
Lebanon became independent in 1943.
   France has supported the Aoun's demand for withdrawal of the
40,000 Syrian soldiers stationed in Lebanon under a peacekeeping
mandate issued by the Arab League in 1976, the year after the
Lebanese civil war began.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William J. Bennett unveiled a Bush
administration plan on Monday to spend at least $70 million
fighting drugs in the nation's capital and said local officials
have allowed the problem to grow glaringly ``out of control.''
   Bennett, director of the national drug control policy office,
said ``the plain fact is that, for too long and in too many
respects, the D.C. government has failed to serve its citizens.''
   The plans include construction of new pretrial detention and
prison facilities, expansion of a local law enforcement task force,
an effort to rid public housing of drug users and dealers,
expansion of drug-treatment facilities, and an increase in
job-training programs.
   Bennett spoke at a news conference with Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp.
   Washington was the nation's murder capital last year with 372
slayings, most of them drug-related. Already this year, there have
been 135 homicides, compared with 87 at this time last year.
   Bennett said ``drugs and demand for drugs sorely test the
responsive abilities of dozens of American cities. But here, where
the problem is so glaring _ so out of control _ serious questions
of local politics and governance can no longer be avoided or
excused. They must be answered. ...
   ``The local government has not acted in as responsible way as
they should have,'' he said. He said the federal effort should not
be construed as an attack on home rule for the district or ``an
attempt to get the city government off the hook.''
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. said he welcomed the federal government's
help, the ``idea of Washington being a model'' in programs to fight
drugs. ``We look forward to a long working relationship,'' the
mayor added. He left a news conference before reporters could ask
if he had been stung by Bennett's remarks.
   Bennett estimated that the plans, approved by President Bush,
will cost $70 million to $80 million, although he cautioned that
there was no firm price tag. The money will come from
``redeployment of existing resources,'' said Bennett, who did not
indicate the current use for the money.
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., applauded the
plan but said the Bush administration must be specific on how it
will be paid for.
   ``There's no way at all that this can be done without
appropriating more money or hurting existing programs,'' Biden said.
   And he said that if the program were to rid the capital of the
scourge of drugs, there would be no way other cities with serious
narcotics problems could be denied similar efforts.
   ``Washington is a special place, a special response is required,
but if we prove the government can solve the drug problem and then
allow the other areas of the country to go begging ... we will have
been somewhat hypocritical,'' Biden said.
   Another lawmaker, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., also praised the
program but said it would be counterproductive if it merely drove
the narcotics traffic out of the capital and into the adjoining
Maryland and Virginia suburbs and then provided no funds for extra
police efforts in those areas.
   Bennett aide Don Hamilton said later that the effort will cost
far more than what Bennett had mentioned. ``That figure doesn't
include the $50 million the D.C. government has already had for
some time'' to build a pretrial detention facility, and ``doesn't
include guard costs, some of the salaries of people who will be
dedicated to this,'' said Hamilton.
   The federal effort includes housing 250 city inmates at federal
prisons, construction of a 500-bed pretrial detention facility to
be built within one year and contruction of a new 700-bed federal
prison for the Washington-Baltimore area within two years.
   Bennett criticized the district government for failing to
construct the detention facility in the three years since Congress
appropriated the money for it, saying that due to the lack of
space, ``thousands of people arrested for drug and other serious
crimes in this city regularly go free.''
   Meanwhile, a Washington-area drug task force will get an
additional 57 federal, state and local investigators under the
plan, including 25 FBI agents and 11 Drug Enforcement
Administration agents.
   Five Defense Department intelligence analysts will be assigned
to the task force, which will concentrate on identifying crack
cocaine distributors in the Washington area and will establish a
unified intelligence system to support all law enforcement
operations in the metropolitan area.
   Kemp outlined plans by the Housing and Urban Development
Department to ease regulations on the eviction of drug offenders
from federally funded housing projects.
   Bennett, saying the city lacked a coordinated effort in its
drug-fighting programs, said the district officials should ``not
(be) dragging their feet on issues Secretary Kemp is talking
about.''
   Kemp asked D.C. Police Chief Maurice Turner to arrange for
issuing photo identification cards for public housing tenants,
installing security devices and control of entrances and exits to
such housing projects.
   Kemp, a former professional football quarterback, also called
for creation of ``baseball and football teams in every public
housing project in America,'' saying he got the idea from a
television broadcast on a Harlem couple who spurred neighbors to
create the area's first Little League team in decades.
   The Department of Health and Human Services is to establish
three model outpatient drug clinics in the city to provide at least
300 new treatment slots by 1990.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush
was letting Bennett be the lead spokesman on the plan and that Bush
``won't comment on individual measures.''
   ``It's Bill Bennett's plan,'' Fitzwater said. ``The president
has reviewed it and approved it in a general sense. ... While
director Bennett's proposals may not be popular, they do represent
a coming to terms with the hard issues.''
   Fitzwater said the initiatives ``will be subject to negotiation
and discussion'' with leaders of the district and of suburban
jurisdictions, saying that the federal government cannot impose
such a plan on the local governments.

<TEXT>
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, spurned
in his first try, won easy nomination Monday to a list of 28
candidates from the Academy of Sciences who will run for seats in
the new Soviet parliament.
   Historian Roy Medvedev, chronicler of dictator Josef Stalin's
purges, emerged a winner in Sunday's runoff election for seats in
the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Medvedev, whose critical studies of Stalinism were not published
in the Soviet Union until recently, won 52.3 percent of the vote in
his race in Moscow's Voroshilov district against Ksenya Razumova,
head of an atomic research laboratory, district election officials
said.
   Sakharov was among 28 members nominated to run for 12 unfilled
seats out of 20 allocated to the Academy of Sciences in the new
congress, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Sakharov, a nuclear physicist who helped develop the Soviet's
atomic bomb, won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights
activities.
   He was exiled to the closed city of Gorky in 1980 for his
criticism of Soviet policies but was allowed to return to Moscow in
December 1986 and has resumed speaking out on political issues.
   Other prominent scientists named in Monday's balloting for the
academy seats included Georgy Arbatov, director of the U.S.A. and
Canada Institute; Roald Sagdeev, a space researcher, and economist
Nikolai Shmelev.
   The final list of 28 was chosen from 168 contenders by 37
members of the academy's presidium. Reporters who attended the
session said Sakharov got 34 votes, Sagdeev, 37, Arbatov, 36 and
Shmelev 34.
   ``During the first round of balloting on March 21, the academy's
general assembly elected just eight of 23 scientists running for
the 20 seats allocated to it under new Soviet legislation,'' Tass
said.
   A final vote to elect the academy's remaining deputies to the
congress will be taken during a general assembly meeting April
19-21, according to Tass.
   Of the 2,250 seats in the congress, 750 were assigned to the
Communist Party and its affiliates and to social and professional
organizations like the Academy of Sciences.
   Sakharov previously was proposed as a candidate, but an academy
electoral commission removed him and other reformers from the final
list in favor of old-guard academy managers. Sakharov supporters
successfully blocked about two-thirds of that slate and forced the
second election.
   Medvedev, unlike Sakharov, ran in one of the 64 constituencies
that held runoff elections Sunday for seats that were not filled
during the March 26 nationwide balloting that saw many top
Communist Party and government officials rejected by voters.
   While Sakharov faces yet another vote, the selection of Medvedev
is final.
   The Tass report on the runoff voting said: ``These
constituencies had fielded three or more candidates who failed to
win the required 50 percent of the vote during the initial round of
voting.
   ``This time, the top two contestants appeared on the ballot and
(one) needed only a simple majority to be elected.''
   Another winner in Moscow's runoff elections was writer Yuri
Chernichenko, a supporter of former Moscow party boss Boris N.
Yeltsin's successful maverick candidacy.
   Pamphlets calling for an election boycott appeared in three
Moscow disticts, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said. It said
the pamphlets apparently were distributed in the hope that fewer
than 50 percent of voters would turn out, forcing yet another
election.
   Tass said there were victors in all of the districts and the
voter turnout was 67.1 percent.
   In Leningrad, where Communist Party chief Yuri Solovyev and
other top officials lost their election bids, lawyer Anatoly
Sobchak won one of six district run-off elections, Tass said.
Sobchak ran on a platform similar to Yeltsin's _ an end to special
privileges for government and party leaders, direct elections of
party officials and the rule of law.
   Lithuania's independent political group Sajudis expanded its
March 26 sweep to gain 36 of the Baltic republic's 42 seats in the
new parliament. Only three Sajudis-backed candidates lost, said
spokesman Alvydas Juozaidis.
   Kjastutis Zaljaskas, the Communist Party chief of Vilnius who is
also an ethnic Lithuanian, won the runoff against a Sajudis-backed
candidate, Tass reported.
   The news agency said new elections will be held May 14 in 199
districts nationwide where only one or two candidates ran and
failed to receive the required 50 percent.

<HEAD>Avril Says Loyalists Fired Blank Shells In Barracks Attack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PIERRE-YVES GLASS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Haitian leader Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril said Monday that loyalist troops fired mostly blank shells to
avoid casualties in a weekend assault on hundreds of rebel soldiers
dug in at an army barracks.
   ``We in the Presidential Guard are aware of our power, but we
never wanted to use it against our brothers,'' the president said
at a news conference at the National Palace.
   Avril said that due to restraint on the part of loyal troops,
only six soldiers were killed in the fighting Friday and Saturday,
although a seventh died Sunday trying to recover an undetonated
grenade.
   He said one civilian was killed in the crossfire, and 75 people
were wounded _ 43 soldiers and 32 civilians.
   Independent but unconfirmed reports earlier said 30 soldiers and
four civilians were killed. There had been no firm estimate of
wounded.
   In another development, two deserters from the Dessalines
Barracks, one of the two mutinous units, hijacked a twin-engine
aircraft carrying a missionary group from Haiti to Fort Lauderdale,
officials said. The plane was diverted to Miami before the two
gunmen surrendered peacefully.
   The two deserters boarded at Cap Haitien on Haiti's north coast.
They were taken to FBI headquarters in Miami.
   Soldiers of the 1,000-man Presidential Guard, based at the
National Palace, assaulted the 750-man Dessalines Barracks Friday
night to crush a rebellion among soldiers demanding Avril's ouster.
The president had narrowly escaped a military coup attempt the
previous Sunday, April 2.
   Throughout Friday night and for much of Saturday, the
Presidential Guard fired blank shells from howitzers and cannons at
the barracks ``to shake them and make them run,'' Avril said.
   But he said the guard decided to launch a full-scale attack with
live ammunition after rebels seized control of a Roman Catholic
seminary less than a mile away and lobbed mortar shells near the
palace, killing three soldiers.
   Asked about the casualties among loyal and rebel troops, Avril
said, ``I am sad to the same extent about all of them.'' His voice
rising and his eyes welling with tears, he said: ``We have the
force. We chose not to use it.''
   Avril, surrounded by 50 helmeted and heavily armed soldiers,
also would not say whether the Dessalines Barracks, which is widely
regarded as the most repressive in the 7,000-man Haititan army,
would be disbanded.
   ``The (army) High Command will study how to use the Dessalines
soldiers in the defense of this country,'' he said.
   Foreign Minister Serge Elie Charles, speaking after the news
conference, said soldiers captured in the weekend assault were
allowed to return home and the government was holding no prisoners
as a result of the operation.
   He said the Dessalines were ordered to report to army
headquarters on Tuesday for instructions.
   Avril said the Leopards Battalion, the other unit that rebelled
against the government last week, was no longer in revolt and the
army command was negotiating with them over their grievances.
   ``We won't say all the problems are resolved, but I think it is
coming,'' the president said, adding that 12 of the 414 soldiers
attached to the commando unit had failed to return to base.
   The Leopards had protested the government's dismissals of
several army officers in a crackdown on drug-running and corruption
in the army. Their former commander, Lt. Col. Himmler Rebu, was
identified as one of the four ringleaders of the coup attempt.
   Avril repeated the government's accusation that the uprising was
led by Haitian exiles linked to the ousted regime of Jean Claude
Duvalier, who fled into exile in France in February 1986.

   Police on Monday investigated two bookstore fires
that stirred speculation they were set by Moslems angered by Salman
Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   The fires were spotted minutes apart at Dillon's and Collet's
bookstores in central London Sunday night. The Fire Brigade said it
suspected arson in both cases.
   Collet's managing director, Eva Skelley, said she believed the
fire was the work of Islamic fundamentalists. She said the shop
received threats for selling copies of ``The Satanic Verses,''
which many Moslems regard as blasphemous.
   The author has been in hiding hiding since Feb. 14, when Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered his execution. Iranian
officials offered a reward of more than $5 million for the writer's
death.
   Rushdie, born in India of Moslem parents, now is a British
citizen.
   The book includes a brothel scene in which prostitutes take the
names of the prophet Mohammed's wives, and it suggests Mohammed
wrote the holy Koran instead of receiving it from Allah.
   Tehran television, monitored in Cyprus, said President Kim Il
Sung of communist North Korea on Monday backed Khomeini's death
sentence. It quoted Kim as saying, ``Publication of this book is
the work of the Great Satan and the racists, and we agree that the
writer of this book should be executed.''
   The Great Satan is Iran's catchword for the United States.
   The television said Kim's remarks came at a meeting with Iran's
visiting deputy foreign minister, Javad Mansouri.
   Ms. Skelley said on British Broadcasting Corp. television
Monday, ``Most booksellers who have been selling Salman Rushdie's
books have been threatened with some kind of action and we were one
of those.''
   London Fire Brigade said the two fires appeared identical in
cause. A spokeswoman, unidentified in keeping with British
practice, said it appeared something flammable was pushed through
the shops' letterboxes and ignited. Fire damage was limited to
doorways, though Collet's suffered considerable smoke damage, she
said.

   The 107-item government ``admission of facts''
presented at Oliver North's trial last week was viewed by some
administration officials as ``incomplete and therefore distorted,''
one official said Monday.
   A note to that effect was not made public in court, although the
42-page admission was.
   An official who saw the note, commenting on condition he not be
named, said it was at the bottom of a cover letter to U.S. District
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell from independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   The statement of facts, agreed to by both the government and
North's lawyers, was introduced to avoid the risks of national
security secrets being disclosed through testimony or documents
that might be put in evidence.
   Among the disclosures in the admission was that George Bush,
then vice president, told the president of Honduras that his nation
would be getting expedited U.S. military and economic aid. Earlier
testimony had indicated then-President Reagan told the Honduran
president such help would be forthcoming in return for his
assisting the Nicaraguan guerrillas.
   Bush has declined to comment on the matter, saying it could
prejudice the North trial. Privately, some State Department and
White House officials have expressed frustration with the document,
saying it does not faithfully represent events as they occurred.

   A Czechoslovak human rights activist who
spent 11 years in jail has been given permission to leave
Czechoslovakia and will settle in West Germany, an emigre source
said Monday.
   Walter Kania, 48, arrived in Vienna Friday with wife and two
children, aged 12 and 14. The family will leave for Bavaria on
Tuesday.
   Kania, who worked as a driver before his arrest, is a signatory
of the Charter 77 human rights manifesto.
   He was in prison from 1977 to May 1988, when he was released for
an interruption of his penalty. He suffered two heart attacks in
prison and also developed a liver infection.
   According to the emigre source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Kania was supposed to have returned to jail after one
year but was exempted under world diplomatic pressure.
   Few Charter 77 signatories have emigrated to the West. One of
the most prominent signatories, playwright Vaclav Havel, has
refused an official offer to leave Czechoslovakia for a Western
country.

<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said
Monday that it has charged the nation's largest dealer in penny
stocks, Stuart-James Co. of Denver, with violating securities laws
and using deceptive telephone sales practices.
   Penny stocks typically sell for less than $3 a share. Some are
issued by legitimate companies, but many are not and the firms
selling them have come under fire from consumer groups and
regulators.
   The SEC, in a civil complaint, said Stuart-James:
   _excessively marked up prices, from 38 percent to 200 percent,
during the first day of trading of two securities it underwrote,
UMB Equities Inc. and Find SVP Inc.
   _falsely and misleadingly in telephone sales pitches predicted
percentages of return from low-price speculative investments.
   _discouraged customrs from selling penny stocks unless another
customer could be found to purchase the security.
   _supported the prices of penny stocks by requiring purchasers of
new issues to either to agree to sell the stock or buy additional
stock once trading started.
   Also charged in the complaint were C. James Padgett and Stuart
Graff, the principal owners of the firm, two current or former
regional vice presidents and seven current or former branch office
managers.
   Marc Geman, executive vice president of the firm, said the
stocks that were allegedly excessively marked up were sold at the
lowest offering price on the over-the-counter NASDAQ system and
purchased at the highest offering price. He also said that the
company's manual for telephone salespersons specifically forbids
predicting returns on investments.
   Stuart-James has 50 offices in 22 states, employing 1,300

   The SEC, in February, proposed new rules cracking down on
high-pressure telephone tactics used by penny stock brokers. Last
October, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder established a task force on
penny stock manipulation.
   According to the agency's staff, about 325 firms sell penny
stock, up from 55 a few years ago.

<TEXT>
   Former Paraguayan President Alfredo
Stroessner, hospitalized for a mild congestive heart failure, is in
satisfactory condition, an official at Sao Paulo's Heart Institute
said Monday.
   Stroessner, 76, was admitted to the hospital Sunday for routine
tests and his condition, ``considering his age, could be accepted
as normal,'' said public relations director Cid Paulo Quaresma
Maida.
   He said Stroessner probably would remain in the hospital for
another day.
   Stroessner came to Brazil Feb. 5, two days after he was ousted
in a coup that ended his nearly 35 years of authoritarian rule. He
bought a home in the coastal resort of Guaratuba 267 miles from Sao
Paulo.
   Heart Institute doctors, speaking on condition they not be
identified, said Stroessner has had heart problems for several
years that he could keep under control with medication.
   Paraguay's foreign minister, Luis Maria Argana, said last week
that Stroessner also suffers from cancer of the prostate and for
``humanitarian reasons'' the new government believes he should go
to a country with advanced medical facilities for treatment.
   He said the United States had refused to grant Stroessner a
temporary visa and Switzerland was being considered.

<HEAD>Authorities Say Arrest Of Drug Boss Is Blow At Corruption</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The attorney general said Monday that
arresting Mexico's biggest reputed drug lord and six police
officials in a weekend sweep was a blow at corruption, and he vowed
the crackdown will continue.
   Enrique Alvarez del Castillo told reporters arresting men like
Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, 43, was ``one of the top priorities''
of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's new administration.
   In addition to Felix Gallardo and three aides, the sweep netted
the top federal anti-drug official in the alleged drug kingpin's
home state and five other ranking police officials, Alvarez said.
   The raids were the third dramatic example of Salinas'
determination. In January he put the previously untouchable leader
of the corrupt oil workers' union behind bars, and in February a
leading stockbroker went to jail.
   ``We will press on regardless of where it leads,'' Alvarez said.
   Ed Heath, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in Mexico,
said, ``The message ... is that President Salinas de Gortari means
business.''
   Felix Gallardo, thought to head a ring that smuggled up to four
tons of cocaine a month into the United States, had been sought for
years but ``obtained protection from diverse authorities,'' Alvarez
said.
   He called Felix Gallardo ``the No. 1 drug trafficker in Mexico''
and said radios, high-powered weapons and several ounces of cocaine
also were seized in the raids.
   U.S. officials believe Felix Gallardo's empire, which employs
thousands of people, is responsible for more than half the cocaine
that passes through Mexico to the United States.
   U.S authorities believe Felix Gallardo was involved in the 1985
slaying of American drug agent Enrique Camarena Salazar, but
Alvarez said Felix Gallardo opposed killing Camarena and that he
had no evidence linking the reputed drug boss directly to the
killing.
   Alvarez added, however, that Felix Gallardo was the
``intellectual author'' of the organization that killed Camarena.
   U.S. officials investigating the murder of Camarena, who was
kidnapped outside the U.S. consulate in Guadalajara, said Felix
Gallardo built an immense operation with protection from high
officials, including a state governor.
   He was arrested Saturday night in Guadalajara.
   ``It was clean work, without a single gunshot,'' said Rene
Hernandez, a spokesman for the attorney general. Alvarez said Felix
Gallardo was being questioned in Mexico City.
   A statement from the attorney general's office said the raids
resulted from Salinas' vow to stop drug dealing and corruption in
Mexico.
   While Federal Judicial Police were seizing Felix Gallardo in the
western state of Jalisco, soldiers arrested every policeman on the
force in his hometown of Culiacan, capital of Sinaloa state in
northwest Mexico.
   Alvarez said federal authorities did not trust the police in
Sinaloa and wanted to avoid a shootout. Most of the officers soon
were released.
   ``We regret that people who have a responsibility to society
have become involved in these events,'' Gov. Francisco Labastida
Ochoa of Sinaloa state said in a statement early Monday.
   Heath told reporters: ``To pull this thing off the way it was
done is a tribute to'' the Mexican government. ``The impact it has
on the drug market, we can say, is extremely significant.''
   Authorities seized some of Felix Gallardo's assets Monday,
including a Guadalajara hotel, pharmacy, real-estate company, bank
accounts and various properties.
   U.S. officials have estimated his net worth at more than $500
million, including at least 50 houses and 200 ranches.
   Felix Gallardo was thought to run one of the world's largest
cocaine trafficking operations. Heath said he ``was as important as
any major trafficker in South America'' and added: ``Felix Gallardo
... has been operating almost with impunity in Mexico because of
the protection he received.''
   The reputed drug baron was said to have have made an alliance
with Colombia's notorious Medellin Cartel to move cocaine through
Mexico to the United States.

   A twin-engine corporate airplane crashed
into an apartment complex and exploded while trying to make an
emergency landing Monday, killing two pilots and their only
passenger.
   Only one minor injury, treated at the scene, was reported on the
ground, although eight apartments were destroyed in the crash and
fire near this Florida Panhandle city, said Escambia County Sheriff
Charlie Johnson.
   ``It weas a miracle that nobody on the ground was killed,''
Johnson said. ``It happened at 1 p.m. If it had happened at 5 p.m.
there's no telling what might have happened.''
   Killed were Jacob Horton of Pensacola, senior vice president of
Gulf Power Co., and the two pilots, John Major and Mike Holmes,
both of Gulfport, Miss., where the plane was based, said Scott
Harrington, a spokesman for the Pensacola-based utility.
   Thomas Powell, 33, said he was showering when he heard a noise
and suddenly could see daylight in his bathroom as the plane tore
away the apartment building's roof.
   The Beechcraft King Air 200 crashed at 1:06 p.m. about four
miles northwest of Pensacola Regional Airport, Johnson said.
   ``The plane was coming in real low over the treetops,'' said
Jerry Johnson, 27, a resident of the Country Walk Estates complex
where the plane crashed. ``It hit the house and flipped.''
   Jerry Johnson, a civilian jet mechanic at the Pensacola Naval
Air Station, said he could tell from the sound of the engines that
the plane was in trouble. He said he also saw smoke coming from one
of the engines before it crashed and exploded, sending a fireball
high in the air.
   ``There were pieces strewn all over the place,'' said Anthony
Baroco, owner of a four-unit apartment building that was destroyed.
The other four damaged apartments were in a neighboring building.
   The plane belonged to Southern Co. Services, a subsidiary of The
Southern Co., an Atlanta-based utility holding company that is also
the parent of Gulf Power, Harrington said. Horton, 57, was Gulf's
second-ranking executive.
   The plane had taken off from the airport minutes earlier en
route to Peachtree-DeKalb Airport in Atlanta, but the pilot radioed
that he had a problem and was turning back, said Arlene Salac, a
spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta.
   She said the pilot declared an emergency but that no report was
immediately available as to what the trouble was, although rain,
thunderstorms and fog were in the area.

   Police stormed a prison in central
Brazil on Monday with guns blazing and rescued about 150 hostages
at a cost of at least eight lives _ six convicts and two policemen,
an official reported.
   Moacir Mendes dos Santos a spokesman with the state secretary
for public security, said all hostages were freed, but he was not
sure if any were badly injured in the shooting at Carumbe Prison in
Cuiaba, 1,380 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Dos Santos said the 250 mutinous inmates were armed with knives,
clubs and revolvers taken from guards who were overpowered at the
same time the hostages were seized Sunday afternoon near the end of
visiting hours.
   At least 20 policemen and prisoners were hurt, he said by phone.
   He said about 300 heavily armed officers ``entered firing after
negotiations failed.''
   He said most of those being held were relatives of prisoners,
including a small number of children, as well as several guards.
   The prisoners demanded revolvers, machine guns, a bus to the
airport, and a plane to fly them to an undisclosed destination, dos
Santos said.
   According to press reports, which dos Santos could not confirm,
the convicts also demanded that a priest and a nurse accompany them
to the airport.
   Non-stop negotiations went on between prison officials and
inmates until Monday afternoon, when police decided they had to
invade the penitentiary, dos Santos said.
   Dos Santos said all figures were unofficial as phone lines to
the prsion were cut Sunday by the prisoners.

   Leftist guerrillas attacked a
civil defense post and a coffee processing plant west of San
Salvador Monday, an army spokesman said.
   Seven civil patrolmen were seriously wounded and the military
post was destroyed in the attacks near Comasagua, 17 miles from the
capital, civilian sources in the area said.
   The army spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
reported casualties but gave no details. He said the El Rosario
coffee processing plant suffered an undetermined amount of damage.
   In fighting last week that ended Thursday, at least 100 people
were killed, the army and guerrillas said.
   An army communique Monday said government troops killed 72
rebels and wounded 103 others. It said the rebels killed 17
civilians, wounded 23 and kidnapped 10 others.
   The rebels, in a broadcast over their clandestine Radio
Venceremos, said they killed or wounded 438 soldiers during the
period, 255 of them in an attack on the 4th Infantry Brigade in the
northern province of Chalatenango on Thursday. At the time, the
army said three soldiers were killed and five others wounded.
   The army said it confiscated mines, other explosives and 30
rifles from the guerrillas. Rebels said they took army rifles and
radios.
   About 70,000 people, the majority of them civilians, have been
killed in the 9-year-old war.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Dissident Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested the leader of the
nation's largest dissident group Monday because of a secret visit
to communist North Korea by a clergyman who advises the
organization.
   Lee Bu-young, co-chairman of the United National Democratic
Movement, was detained after attending a meeting to arrange a
welcome for the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, who visited North Korea on March
25 and met with its leader, Kim Il Sung, about reunifying the
peninsula.
   A goverment prosecutor, who spoke on condition of not being
identified, said Lee, 46, may be charged with violating a law
banning activity that supports or helps North Korea.
   Moon visited North Korea without the required government
approval and faces arrest when he returns from Tokyo, where he
stopped on the way home. He has said he would arrive in Seoul on
Thursday, the day before his passport expires.
   Prosecutors said Lee was being questioned about whether he knew
of Moon's trip in advance. They said they also suspect Lee of
aiding an illegal strike that has paralyzed South Korea's largest
shipyard for more than three months.
   His arrest may presage a crackdown on the increasingly militant
dissidents, who officials claim want to replace the government of
President Roh Tae-woo with one more friendly to Seoul's communist
rival.
   Several people were arrested last month, including two of Moon's
sons. Officials have indicated many dissident leaders might be
arrested after Moon's return.
   Roh ordered police last week to intensify efforts against
``radical leftists.'' In nationwide raids on publishing houses and
bookstores, police seized 11,000 books they said promoted North
Korea and communism.
   Korea was divided in 1945 and the two nations fought a war in
1950-53 that began with an invasion by North Korea.
   Also Monday, friends and family paid homage to a student who
died after dousing himself with paint thinner and gasoline and
setting himself afire, shouting ``Yankees go home!'' to protest the
U.S. presence in South Korea.
   Nam Tae-hyun, a 24-year-old senior majoring in ethics at Seoul
National Teacher's College, died Saturday hours after setting
himself ablaze.
   Choe Song-ho, 24, said he was on his way to a student rally when
he heard a voice shouting from a classsroom ``Yankee go home!''
``Drive out U.S. imperialists!'' and ``Peaceful unification!'' He
said he found Nam in flames. Students who accompanied Nam to the
hospital said he told them he burned himself ``for independence of
the fatherland. For peace. For unification (with North Korea).''

   The House ethics committee has voted to cite
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Tex., for more than 30 incidents of ethical
wrongdoing and is continuing to review other allegations, CBS News
reported Monday evening.
   The results of the committee's investigation, which began last
June, are expected to be made public next week.
   CS quoted unnamed sources close to the investigation as saying
the charges will involve business activities with Fort Worth, Tex.,
developer George Mallich which were designed to financially benefit
Wright and his wife, Betty, by skirting House ethics rules.
   Mallick told the network that the small company, which was
started in 1980, was perfectly legitimate. `It was a small
corporation between friends...like an investment club. We wanted to
dabble in business together.''
   According to a document obtained by CBS _ a defense of Wright's
activities _ the panel's outside investigator, Chicago attorney
Richard Phelan, ``has concluded that the Wright Mallick company
`Malightoo' was an articifice or a conduit to pass gifts to the
Wrights,'' the network said.
   CBS said the report alleges that the Wrights were furnished a
cut-rate Forth Worth apartment and Mrs. Wright received an annual
salary of $18,000 plus use of a company car which she brought to
Washington and purchased only after learning that the ethics
committee was investigating.
   Mallick told CBS that Mrs. Wright earned the money she was paid.
``She had many duties and performed them well. She was one of the
most liked people in the organization.
   CBS said other charges include questionable oil deals and
attempts to avoid House limits from outside income.
   Wright is expcted to be cited, the network said, for alleged
wrongdoing by himself and his staff for converting honoraria to the
purchase of his book, ``Reflection of a Public Man.''
   The network quoted a spokesman in Wright's office as saying it
would be ``absurd'' to report the committee had voted to cite the
speaker for more than 30 allegations.

<HEAD>Kitty Dukakis Meets Recovering Alcoholics From Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three recovering alcoholics from the Soviet
Union shared the first day of their visit to the United States with
a fellow sufferer, Kitty Dukakis, on a tour of an alcoholism unit
at a Manhattan hospital Monday.
   ``Alcoholics are the same in Moscow and in New York and in
Boston and all over the world. They share the same disease,'' Mrs.
Dukakis said after the tour at Bellevue Hospital.
   Mrs. Dukakis, the wife of Massachusetts governor Michael
Dukakis, was treated for alcoholism in February following her
husband's unsuccessful campaign as Democratic presidential
candidate.
   The three Soviets, identified only as Sasha, Victor and Volodja,
are visiting the United States for two weeks to learn about the
treatment of alcoholism here. They are the guests of the
Soviet-U.S. Joint Conference on Alcoholism, Drug Addiction and
Peace.
   Alcoholism is ``the most democratic of diseases,'' said the Rev.
J.W. Canty, the chairman of the Joint Conference and an Episcopal
priest from New York City who lives in Moscow.
   ``It happens to auto workers along the Volga River and it
happens to auto workers in Detroit. It happens to first ladies in
the United States and it happens to cleaning ladies in Moscow,'' he
said.
   Canty estimated that there are 10 million alcoholics in the
United States and 10 million to 15 million in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet visitors overcame their 20-year drinking problems
through Moscow Beginners, the first anti-drinking group for Soviet
citizens that is registered with Alcoholics Anonymous, said Canty,
who helped start the group in 1987.
   The three men, whose last names were withheld, had tried
unsuccessfully for years to dry out in state-run facilities for
alcoholics, he added.
   ``I think the principle of Alcoholics Anonymous is more
effective because it depends on the person himself _ because it
depends on his friends in Alcoholics Anonymous,'' said Victor, a
film producer, through a translator.
   In the Soviet Union, alcoholics undergo compulsory
hospitalization for as long as six months and are forced to spend
up to two years in institutions reserved for those who cannot be
cured by the hospitals.
   ``The fact that it (AA) is one recovering alcoholic helping
another one introduces a whole new experience of trust and honesty
and mutual dependency which the Soviet people are not familiar
with,'' Canty said.
   Mrs. Dukakis was on hand at Kennedy International Airport to
greet the Soviet visitors and their translator Helen Kuzmicheva,
who runs the Soviet-U.S. Alcoholism Center in Moscow, a
Western-style out-patient clinic that opened April 3.
   Mrs. Dukakis then accompanied them for a quick burger and shake
at a fast food restaurant in midtown before going to the hospital.
   Dr. Marc Galanter, the director of the division of alcohol and
drug abuse at Bellevue, said the Soviets ``seemed to be favorably
impressed'' with the hospital.
   ``I think they would have to go a ways in Moscow to equal the
set-up here,'' he added.
   During their two-week visit, the Soviets will also visit the
world headquarters of Alcoholics Anonymous in New York, attend open
AA meetings and visit Chit Chat Farms, an alcoholism rehabilitation
center in Warnersville, Pa.

<HEAD>Chief of Sweden's Security Police Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Sweden's secret service
resigned Monday, a day before a report was to be submitted to the
government on the counterespionage agency.
   The report by a member of the governing Social Democratic Party
purportedly criticizes the service's effectiveness after the
killing of Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986.
   Sune Sandstrom said his resignation will take effect as soon as
the government names a replacement. Sandstrom, 49, was appointed in
1987 to head the Sakerhetspolis, or security police, known as SAPO.
   Sandstrom issued a statement saying he was quitting because the
government appeared to want a SAPO chief with ``a broader base of
experience'' and who was more than ``a policeman.''
   Sandstrom has been criticized for allegedly allowing book
publisher Ebbe Carlsson to conduct his own investigation last year
into the Palme killing when the police search failed to determine
the gunman who killed the prime minister as he was walking along a
Stockholm street.
   Sandstrom also allegedly was implicated in connection with an
attempt to smuggle illegal wiretapping equipment into Sweden.
   The scandal over Carlsson's private investigation previously
brought about the resignations of the head of the national police,
Nils Erik Ahmansson, and Justice Minister Anna Greta Leijon.
   Carl Bildt, head of the opposition Conservative party, said he
feared the government may appoint a politician to head SAPO.
   ``I am worried. We must have an efficient security police to
protect ourselves against spies and terrorists,'' he said on
national radio.
   A 42-year-old man suspected in Palme's killing was arrested Dec.
14. Officials have said the trial of Christer Pettersson will start
May 29 and is expected to last at least four weeks. Pettersson has
denied he shot Palme.

   Famed singer-actress Grace Jones is in
jail after being arrested over the weekend for possession of
cocaine, police said Monday.
   They said the Jamaican-born Ms. Jones, 37, who became a movie
star playing opposite Roger Moore in the James Bond film ``A View

   A police report said ``a powdery substance believed to be
cocaine was found in her handbag. It was wrapped in two Jamaican $2
currency notes.''
   The police did not say precisely how much cocaine was found.
   The arrest was made in the Kingston suburb of Stony Hill, where
Ms. Jones was vacationing. She was being held in the police lockup
there and was scheduled for hearing Tuesday at Stony Hill Resident
Magistrates Court.
   Ms. Jones lives in Los Angeles and New York.

   News that a handsome aide to the queen wrote
personal letters to Princess Anne prompted new Page One speculation
Monday that Anne's marriage is on the rocks. But her father-in-law
denied the marriage has broken down.
   Anne herself, the 38-year-old daughter of Queen Elizabeth II,
smiled through a typically busy day of engagements.
   As Scotland Yard investigated the theft of the letters from the
princess' desk at Buckingham Palace, Britain's tabloids questioned
in banner headlines whether her 15-year marriage to fellow
equestrian Mark Phillips would survive.
   ``Can This Marriage Be Saved?,'' asked the Daily Mail. ``Anne
Divorce Crisis At Palace,'' said Today. ``Royal Marriage Crisis:
Anne Sad, Shattered, Alone,'' trumpeted the Daily Mirror.
   Maj. Peter Phillips, Anne's 68-year-old father-in-law, denied
the marriage was washed up. He told reporters: ``It's not the sort
of marriage that ordinary people would understand at all _ they
spend so much time away from one another.
   ``If people are royal, they don't necessarily spend lots of time
together. It's inevitable. Princess Anne and Mark come together and
they part, doing the various jobs which they have got to do.
   ``One does not inquire about when they last got together. ... Of
course their marriage is very unusual.''
   Phillips added, ``Mark rang me last night (Sunday). ... He would
confide in me if there was anything wrong but all the conversation
was about horses. ... The marriage side of things was not discussed
at all.''
   The three principals at the heart of the speculation remained
silent on the subject.
   Anne appeared in a happy mood as she carried out a busy schedule
of activities in northwest England including opening a $68 million
shopping center in Liverpool.
   Margaret Maguire, a shopper who talked with Anne, said later,
``She is beautiful _ a credit to her country. It is her own life
and the press should leave her alone.''
   Phillips, a 40-year-old commoner and former captain in The
Queen's Dragoon Guards, spent the day at the couple's Gatcombe Park
estate in western England.
   Royal Navy Cmdr. Timothy Laurence, the 34-year-old bachelor who
wrote the stolen letters, was at Windsor Castle, continuing with
his normal duties as an equerry, or aide, to the queen, Buckingham
Palace said.
   Rumors of trouble in the princess' marriage have circulated
since 1981. In recent years, she and her husband have spent up to
six months a year apart.
   Anne has become the busiest and one of the most admired members
of the royal family, undertaking grueling travels on behalf of
children in poverty-stricken and war-torn Third World countries.
Phillips has also traveled widely for a variety of business and
equestrian interests.
   On their 15th anniversary on Nov. 15, Anne attended a Buckingham
Palace ball while Phillips was giving riding lessons in Australia.
   Britain's tabloids have tried to link Anne to a former bodyguard
and actor Anthony Andrews, and Phillips to one of his stable girls,
a Canadian public relations executive and Pamella Bordes, a former
Miss India who worked as a researcher in the House of Commons.
   The latest rumors began after The Sun, Britain's
largest-circulation tabloid, reported Thursday that four letters
stolen from Anne had been sent anonymously to the paper and turned
over to Scotland Yard.
   After a Sunday newspaper told Buckingham Palace it was going to
name the letter-writer, the palace identified Laurence, who served
on the royal yacht Britannia before become a top aide to the queen.
It described him as a friend of the princess' but refused to
disclose the contents.
   The Daily Mirror, which called the letters ``highly personal,''
said Monday that the princess had visited Laurence's home in
Winchester at least half a dozen times, sometimes with her two
children, Peter, 11, and Zara, 7.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage,
said: ``The matter cannot be left hanging in the air like this.''
   There is a precedent for a royal divorce. Anne's aunt, Princess
Margaret, the queen's only sister, was divorced in 1978 from Lord
Snowden, who has since remarried. Anne herself is seventh in line
to the throne, far enough down the line of succession not to create
problems for the monarchy if she were to divorce.
   Nigel Dempster, Britain's best-known gossip columnist who writes
in The Daily Mail, said Anne and Phillips haven't divorced because
neither wants to marry someone else.
   ``I think everyone including Mark and the royal family have been
aware that the marriage as such had been over for a very long
time,'' he told the BBC.

<HEAD>Barge Carrying Nuclear Reactor Heads Up Columbia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A lone kayaker and other anti-nuclear
activists confronted a barge carrying the containment vessel from
one of the nation's oldest commercial nuclear reactors as it moved
up the Columbia River on Monday.
   The kayaker, Stan Overbay, paddled out to the barge and placed
himself in front of the lead tugboat, but a Coast Guard vessel
jockeyed him out of the way and the barge continued without
stopping.
   The concrete- and steel-encased reactor vessel from
Shippingport, Pa., is on the last leg of an 8,000-mile voyage to
burial at the Hanford, Wash., nuclear reservation. The U.S.
Department of Energy said radioactive fuel has been removed from
the shell and it poses no threat to public health.
   The barge passed into the Colombia River near Astoria Monday
morning and was expected to complete the 100-mile journey to
Portland after dark, said Lt. Commander David Gault of the Coast
Guard.
   Near Astoria, the tug that brought the barge from Pennsylvania
through the Panama Canal turned back and was replaced by a tug
owned by Knappton Shipping Co. of Astoria, Gault said.
   About 20 people staged a protest at an Astoria pier as the barge
passed by, and demonstrations also were planned at Portland and
Hood River, about 65 miles up river from Portland.
   A person standing six feet from the 1,000-ton container vessel
would receive no more radiation than they would from the sun over
the same period, according to the Department of Energy.
   ``If it really is so safe, why does it need Coast Guard cutters
guarding it and why wouldn't they say when it's coming?'' said
Joanne Oleksiak of the Northwest Radiation Alert Network
   She said Northwest residents don't want the Columbia, which
forms the border between Washington and Oregon, used as a
thoroughfare for nuclear waste.
   ``It's not the kind of thing people want passing by their picnic
or their houseboat,'' she said.
   The Coast Guard has established a safety zone 400 yards ahead,
200 yards behind and 100 years to either side of the barge, and
violators face criminal and civil penalities, said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Bret Koontz in Seattle.
   Gault said there have been several shipments up the Columbia in
which safety zones were established.
   ``This is nothing new for us,'' he said. ``The only difference
this time is there's been more publicity.''

   An Israeli wearing army fatigues opened fire
with an Uzi submachine gun Monday evening, killing a Palestinian
and wounding three as they sat on the grass outside the walled Old
City, police and witnesses reported.
   Israel radio said an anonymous telephone caller speaking Hebrew
with a French accent claimed responsibility in the name of the
Sicarites group, which has made several arson attacks on left-wing
Israeli targets.
   In other developments Monday:
   _Police spokesmen said Chaim Bar-Lev, the police minister,
issued orders that bar some young Palestinians from praying at the
Al Aqsa mosque complex, one of Islam's holiest sites.
   _A military source said Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the chief of
staff, forced a colonel to resign because of attacks on
Palestinians by soldiers he commanded. The daily Maariv called it
the harshest action in more than a decade against an officer of
such a high rank serving in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   _In the West Bank town of Hebron troops shot and killed an Arab
stonethrower, an army spokesman said. Israel radio identified the
slain man as Jamil Natche and said he was shot when a group of
masked people attacked an army jeep with stones.
   _Arab hospital officials said five Palestainians were wounded by
army gunfire in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The army confirmed
two people were wounded and said it was investigating.
   Natche's death raised to 423 the number of Arabs killed in the
Palestinian uprising that began in December 1987. Eighteen Israelis
also have been slain in violence related to the uprising.
   According to Israel radio's account of the attack in Jerusalem,
the caller described the shooting as retaliation for stoning
attacks on Jews.
   The assailant escaped by foot after the shooting at about 7:40
p.m. near the Jaffa Gate, a main entrance to the Old City.
   Mahmoud Zahdeh, 20, a hotel waiter interviewed in his hospital
bed, said he and friends were resting after a day of fasting in the
Moslem holy month of Ramadan.
   ``Four of us were sitting on the lawn near the Jaffa Gate eating
pumpkin seeds when a soldier in his late 30s, with slightly gray
hair, approached us and looked at us for a while,'' he said.
   ``He was wearing a military uniform, but with no hat, and was
carrying a short rifle. He left and returned two minutes later. He
did not talk to us. He only started shooting.''
   Zahdeh was shot five times and had wounds in the shoulders, left
leg and scalp.
   Reporters who arrived moments after the shooting said the body
of a man in his 30s was beside the wall and more than a dozen empty
cartridge casings were scattered about. Police identified the dead
man as Khaled Shawish, 26, a blacksmith from the Old City.
   Officials at Bikur Holim Hospital said a 19-year-old factory
worker from Jerusalem was in critical condition with chest and head
wounds, and a cousin of the dead man was being treated for wounds
to the lower stomach, arms and legs.
   Yosef Yehudai of the Jerusalem police said of the attacker: ``He
did not shout. As far as we know, he never said a word and his
movements were sudden. He was standing five meters from his
victims, very close.''
   Bar-Lev's order barring some Arabs from praying at Al Aqsa is
believed to be without precedent. Palestinians rioted outside the
mosque Friday, the first day of Ramadan, and some of the rocks
thrown struck Jews praying at the nearby Western Wall, the holiest
shrine of Judaism.
   About 4,000 Palestinians were involved in the riots, during
which 12 people were reported injured and 37 Arabs were arrested.
   Rafi Levy, the police spokesman, said in explaining Bar-Lev's
order: ``There will be restrictions against those who we fear might
disrupt order, which means youths from the territories. Every
violation of public order will be met with an immediate response.''
   He said Moslem worshipers would be required to give police their
identity cards before entering the mosque complex.
   Since capturing the Old City in 1967, Israel has taken pride in
allowing free access to holy sites of all religions. During the
uprising, however, it sometimes has blocked traffic from the
occupied lands to prevent riots at Al Aqsa after midday prayers on
Friday, the Moslem sabbath.
   Col. Yehuda Meir decided to quit after Shomron said he would
have to stand trial otherwise, the military source said.
   Meir was military governor of Nablus in the West Bank when the
uprising started, and Maariv said the investigation dealt with two
incidents.
   Last year, in Kfar Salem near Nablus, soldiers under Meir's
command used a bulldozer to bury four Palestinians. The victims
survived.
   The other case involved beatings of two Palestinian teen-agers
in Nablus, one of which was filmed by U.S. television cameras.

   Jessica McClure's parents and the
performers cast to play them in a television movie met Monday, and
watched a recreation of her 1987 rescue from a well shaft, an
operation that enthralled the nation.
   Jessica, who is now 3, and parents Chip and Cissy were flown out
from their Midland, Texas, home to meet the cast of ``Everybody's
Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure.''
   At a news conference, a smiling Jessica played with a camera and
microphone, then told the crowd of journalists, ``No more
pictures.''
   ``She's just a little doll,'' said Ellen Gonzalez, a spokeswoman
for the production.
   ``The only scars left are only physical and they are fading
away,'' said her father. He said his daughter can't remember the
ordeal that ended Oct. 16, 1987, as millions watched on television.
   ``She knows what people tell her,'' her mother said. ``She's the
little girl who fell down the well.
   ``What she recalls is that Winnie the Pooh saved her,'' her
mother added. ``I don't know how she got that idea. ... Maybe she
remembers me singing it to her.''
   The film is scheduled for broadcast May 21 on ABC-TV. It stars
Roxana Zal and Will Oldham as the McClures. Miss Zal won Emmy and
Golden Globe awards for her work in the ABC film ``Something About
Amelia.''
   Beau Bridges will play the police chief of Midland, Academy
Award-winner Patty Duke will play a crisis counselor and veteran
character actor Pat Hingle will play the fire chief.
   Jessica and her parents watched filming of part of the rescue
attempt in a tunnel and well built at Culver Studios 10 miles west
of downtown Los Angeles.
   Jessica was 18 months old when she tumbled 22 feet to the bottom
of an abandoned well while playing in her aunt's backyard on Oct.
14, 1987. She remained trapped in a space only eight inches in
diameter for nearly 59 hours while rescuers drilled a side tunnel
through solid rock to reach her.

   Worried parents pulled 10 to 20 children
out of classes Monday after a drawing of an assault rifle and the
words ``You're Dead'' were found spray-painted on a school wall, 10
days after telephone threats against pupils.
   State police escorted buses from the school, as they did last
week after the two anonymous phone threats.
   Police said the graffiti, including the phrase ``You're gonzo,''
appeared to be the work of juveniles and not of the person who made
the threats.
   The graffiti was found on an outside wall of the junior high
school. The school is part of the Brooklyn School, which has three
buildings and serves about 850 students in kindergarten through
ninth grade.
   Doors were locked and police were stationed at the school.
   The graffiti was removed, but not until after most of the pupils
saw it, school officials said.
   Some parents picked up their children rather than having them
take the buses, which serve about 98 percent of the students from
the school in the rural area of northeastern Connecticut. Students
were not allowed to walk or bicycle home, and buses were loaded one
at a time.
   ``Maybe it is kids playing a prank. But why take a chance?''
said Barbara Devolve, who decided to drive her son home rather than
having him go by bus. Devolve said she would probably keep her
12-year-old son, Bobby, out of school the rest of the week,
although he had insisted pupils were not worried.
   ``I'm just not going to tempt fate,'' said Chris Crawford, who
came to pick up his son and daughter, both of whom usually ride the
bus.
   ``Most youngsters are taking it in stride. They are probably
less concerned about it than parents, who worry more because they
are not here to see what's going on,'' said Superintendent of
Schools Louise Berry.
   School officials had hoped to restore a sense of normalcy Monday
after six school days of heightened security measures, taken after
a woman warned in a March 30 telephone call to Town Hall that she
planned to shoot children in the schoolyard.
   The next morning a female caller _ police are unsure if it was
the same woman _ telephoned a school bus coordinator and threatened
to kill the children on the bus driven by the coordinator's wife.
   School administrators have told parents they believe there is no
danger, but have left to families the decision on whether to keep
children out of school, Berry said.
   She said the school system would probably have to end its long
practice of allowing parents and others to come and go from the
buildings as they wish.
   ``We now have to face the fact that it's probably not wise to
have such freedoms,'' Berry said. ``It's sad.''

<TEXT>
   Arab states should help Israel pay to ``establish
a human condition'' for the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
living in refugee camps in occupied territories, Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Monday.
   ``Israel doesn't have the financial means to solve all these
problems'' in the refugee camps, Shamir said at a news conference
during a day-long trip to Chicago to promote a Middle East peace
plan he proposed last week.
   ``It couldn't substitute for a political solution but it could
improve the climate,'' he said.
   According to U.N. relief officials, who manage the refugee camps
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, about 335,000
Palestinians live in the camps. Altogether, about 1.7 million
Palestinians live in the occupied lands, most in towns and cities.
   Shamir estimated it would cost $1 billion to solve problems in
the camps.
   There is a need to ``organize to provide housing and to
establish a human condition for their life there,'' Shamir said.
   Shamir also detailed some of the issues he discussed last week
with President Bush and Secretary of State James Baker III, and
said Israel would listen to any proposal brought to the negotiating
table under a plan proposed Thursday to the Bush administration.
   The plan calls for Palestinian balloting to select
representatives who would negotiate an interim solution of
self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel seized those
territories from neighboring Arab states in the 1967 Middle East
War, and they have been the site of an uprising Palestinian leaders
say won't end until Israel withdraws.
   Asked whether Israel would consider negotiating land for peace,
Shamir said land is not the issue now, but the country would listen
to any proposal.
   ``We will listen to anything,'' he said. ``Both parties will
listen to all proposals that are brought to the table of
negotiations.''
   ``It will be a full self rule'' for perhaps five years while a
permanent solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is negotiated,
Shamir said.
   ``It will have all the power of a government except security and
foreign relations,'' he said. ``There will be some problems they
will have to settle with the authorities of Israel.''
   Shamir discounted comments Sunday by the opposition Labor Party
leader, Finance Minister Shimon Peres. Peres said Israel had in
effect abandoned its longstanding refusal to negotiate with the
Palestine Liberation Organization by letting the United States
mediate a proposal that could result in PLO supporters being
elected.
   ``We don't see the PLO as a factor in the peace initiative,'' he
said. ``(But) we will try to negotiate with Palestinian Arabs that
are interested in peace.''
   He also called for a meeting to celebrate the 1979 Camp David
accords, which Shamir labled ``the most successful endeavor to
resolve the Arab-Israeli crisis.''
   Shamir's plan is a modified version of the accords, but it
differs in that it calls for elections, followed by negotiations on
autonomy.
   The anniversary meeting would ``review prospects for enlarging
the peace process,'' Shamir said.
   Shamir was to travel to New York later Monday to discuss the
plan with Jewish groups before returning to Israel on Thursday to
begin working out the details of the peace plan.

<TEXT>
   Four people were convicted Monday on
charges stemming from the second-largest cash heist in U.S.
history, a $7.1 million Wells Fargo robbery allegedly used to fund
a group seeking to overthrow the government in Puerto Rico.
   One defendant was acquitted.
   Key defendant Juan Segarra Palmer III was convicted on robbery,
conspiracy and transportation of stolen money charges; he was found
innocent on four weapons-related charges. All charges stemmed from
the Sept. 12, 1983, theft of cash from the Wells Fargo depot in
West Hartford.
   Segarra, a 39-year-old Harvard University graduate who was
charged in all 16 counts of the indictment, faces up to 165 years
in prison. His bond was revoked.
   Also convicted were were Antonio Camacho Negron, 45, a car
mechanic; Norman Ramirez Talavera, 32, a graphic artist; and Robert
Maldonado Rivera, 53, a lawyer. The only defendant cleared was
Carlos Ayes Suarez, 29, an anthropology student.
   Camacho faces up to 15 years in prison. The others face up to
five years each. No date for sentencing was set.
   Camacho's wife, Rebecca, and two other supporters of the
defendants were arrested later for blocking traffic outside the
courthouse.
   As he was led from the courtroom, Camacho raised a clenched fist
an denounced the proceedings in Spanish.
   Linda Backiel, Camacho's attorney, said he yelled: ``The
imperial power is showing how small it is.'' She said Comacho would
appeal his conviction.
   ``There are a lot of errors and it was a slim case,'' she said.
``Because he was a Puerto Rican patriot, he never expected justice
and he won't ask for mercy.''
   ``The defense put the system on trial and after nine days the
jury came back with a verdict that was well reasoned and proved
that the system works,'' said U.S. Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr.
   Segarra acknowledged he knew about the robbery beforehand and
received the stolen money to finance the activities of Los
Macheteros, Spanish for ``machete-wielders,'' a group seeking the
overthrow of the U.S. government in Puerto Rico.
   But Segarra steadfastly denied that he helped plan or execute
the robbery, as the government charged.
   The other four defendants were charged with conspiracy and with
either helping transport the stolen money or using part of it to
finance Three Kings Day toy giveaways in Hartford and Puerto Rico
on Jan. 6, 1985.
   The government contended that Los Macheteros recruited Wells
Fargo guard Victor Gerena to carry out the robbery, then helped
Gerena escape to Cuba, where he is believed to live now.
   Segarra's attorney, Leonard Weinglass, said he was disappointed
by the verdict. He said his client's chances of a successful appeal
were very good.
   Weinglass contended that the jury reached what he characterized
as an illegal compromise verdict by convicting Segarra on robbery
charges but clearing him of weapons violations.
   Ayes said he would return to Puerto Rico with mixed emotions. He
accused prosecutors of trying to ``criminalize the pro-independence
movement of our country.''
   ``As long as Puerto Rico is still a colony, we have a moral
obligation to fight for the independence of our country by whatever
means are available,'' he said.
   The government presented 110 witnesses and more than 700 pieces
of evidence, including tape-recorded conversations and documents
seized from Los Macheteros members.
   During the 5{-month trial, prosecutors presented evidence that
Los Macheteros were desperate for money in 1983 and that Segarra
was put in charge of getting it. Other evidence indicated Segarra
was sent from Puerto Rico to New England more than a month before
the robbery and returned to the island within weeks afterward.
   About $80,000 in what was believed to be stolen money was seized
by FBI agents during searches in Puerto Rico and Boston on Aug. 30,
1985, when 13 people were arrested. The government contends that
Los Macheteros spent about $1 million, moved more than $2 million
to Cuba and squirreled away $4 million in safety deposit boxes,
certificates of deposit, savings accounts and farmhouse cellars in
Puerto Rico.
   Weinglass, Segarra's attorney, asserted during closing arguments
that the robbery itself was so unprofessional that it couldn't have
been planned by a sophisticated, clandestine organization.
   He noted that for his getaway, Gerena rented an old jalopy he
couldn't rely on and it took him more an hour to move the half-ton
of cash from the Wells Fargo vault into the car's trunk.
   If a sophisticated group had been involved, Weinglass said,
other people would have been there to help.
   Weinglass also attacked the credibility of two key government
witnesses: Segarra's friend, Kenneth Cox, and Segarra's former
lover, Anne Gassin. Weinglass called Cox a paid liar who received
$15,000 from the FBI for his testimony and described Gassin as a
spurned lover intimidated into testifying because she herself faced
charges of laundering some of the stolen money.
   The other defendants claimed they were victims of mistaken
identity and faulty government logic. The government failed to
prove, they said, that they were the people overheard through
electronic surveillance and identified only by code name while
discussing the robbery.
   Defense attorneys also argued their clients were being
prosecuted because of their support for Puerto Rican independence
and for legitimate activities for Los Macheteros.
   Two other defendants _ lawyer Paul S. Weinberg of Springfield,
Mass., and Segarra's wife, Luz Berrios Berrios _ pleaded guilty to
reduced charges before the trial began Oct. 11. Nine others await
trial while the government appeals the judge's dismissal of some
tape-recorded evidence.
   The largest cash theft in U.S. history, $7.9 million, occurred
at another Wells Fargo depot in New York City on April 29, 1985.

   A passenger plane lost control and
crashed into a foggy mountainside in southeastern France on Monday
night, killing all 22 people aboard, officials said.
   Rescuers located the wreckage of the Fokker 27 about 3{ hours
after the crash, which occurred shortly after 9 p.m. as the plane
was about to land, local officials said.
   They found bodies among the aircraft's scattered debris in a
forest near the village of Leoncel, about 15 miles from this city
in southeastern France.
   The wreckage was on the northern face of the Vercors mountain,
at an altitude of 3,900 feet. Officials said the cloud cover was
low and the area was foggy.
   The twin-engine turboprop, was flying for the private airline
Europe Aero-Service. It was making a regular flight from Paris'
Orly Airport to Valence.
   The control tower at Mont Verdun, near Lyon, lost contact with
the plane at 9:10 p.m. The plane was scheduled to land at 9:18 p.m.
at the Chabeuil airport, near Valence, which is south of Lyon.
   There was no immediate explanation why the aircraft flew into
the mountainside as it was making its landing approach.
   Three children were among the 19 passengers aboard, police and
rescue officials said. Three crew members were aboard the aircraft.
   Officials said rescue workers concentrated their search for the
82-foot aircraft around Leoncel because numerous residents reported
hearing a loud noise or explosion at about the same time the
aircraft lost contact with the control tower.
   A Fokker 27 crashed March 4, 1988 on a flight from Nancy to
Paris, killing 23 people. It was the worst plane accident in France
since 1981.

   An anti-apartheid campaigner from South Africa
said Monday relations with the Soviet Union would not be possible
until apartheid is abolished, the official news agency Tass
reported.
   Frederick Van Zyl Slabbert, heading a delegation from the
Institute for a Democratic Alternative for South Africa, met
members of the Communist Party Central Committee, Foreign Ministry
officials and members of the Academy of Sciences Africa Institute.
   He later told a news conference that for a political settlement
in South Africa to become a reality, all detainees must be
released, the 34-month-old state of emergency must be lifted and
apartheid dismantled, Tass said.
   ``The delegation's conclusion was that as long as apartheid
exists in South Africa, there can be no question of diplomatic
relations between that country and the Soviet Union,'' Tass quoted
Van Zyl Slabbert as saying.
   He said it was obvious the Soviet Union wanted to play a
constructive role and cooperate with other nations in settling the
conflict between the Pretoria government and the outlawed and
exiled African National Congress.
   Tass quoted Van Zyl Slabbert as saying that before he visited
Moscow, he saw the Soviet Union as a country devoted to exporting
revolution and hoping to destroy South Africa by using the ANC as a
proxy.
   ``Delegation members had believed they would be closely watched
and force-fed Soviet views, but none of this actually happened and
he would now advise all his acquaintances to visit the Soviet
Union,'' Tass said.
   Apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Snow In New England, Rain In The South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Spring snow showers fell Monday from the lower Great Lakes to
New England, and showers and thunderstorms extended from Texas to
the Carolinas. Temperatures fell to record lows in 35 cities in the
Midwest and West.
   An inch of snow fell in Binghamton and Syracuse, N.Y., during
six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT, and snow advisories were in effect
in western New York state.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell from south central Texas to much
of Georgia and the Carolina coast. The thunderstorms were
concentrated over southern Georgia, northern Florida and the
central Gulf Coast.
   Icy roads in the Denver area caused dozens of traffic accidents
during the Monday rush hour, authorities said.
   Sunny skies prevailed across the West and from the northern and
central Plains to the Great Lakes and northern Ohio Valley.
   Temperatures across much of the nation east of the Rockies were
only in the 30s and 40s, with readings in the 20s in sections of
the upper Great Lakes and central High Plains.
   Freeze warnings were posted Monday night for parts of Indiana,
Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennesee, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, West
Virginia, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina.
   ``Everything that is in bloom is going to get zapped,'' Marion
County, Ind., extension agent Richard Crum predicted.
   Record lows for the date were set in 33 cities and tied in two.
New records included 14 degrees in Lansing, Mich., where the old
mark of 18 degrees had stood since 1869; 10 degrees in Scottsbluff,
Neb., (12 degrees, 1898); and 5 degrees in Cheyenne, Wyo. (6
degrees, 1959).
   Unseasonably warm weather continued in the Southwest, with
readings in the 80s and 90s across much of Arizona and California
on Monday afternoon.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 24
degrees in Laramie, Wyo., to 95 degrees in Gila Bend, Ariz. The
nation's low Monday morning was 4 degrees below zero in Yellowstone
National Park, Wyo.
   Tuesday's forecast calls for scattered snow showers across the
Great Lakes and the upper Mississippi Valley, with snow likely in
upper Michigan; rain showers from Virginia to Georgia, with
scattered showers and thunderstorms across Florida; widely
scattered rain showers across the southern High Plains and fair to
partly sunny skies prevailing across the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 50s and 60s in much of
the country; below 50 degrees from eastern Montana to the Great
Lakes, the northern Ohio Valley, New England and New Jersey; in the
30s from eastern North Dakota to upper Michigan; in the 70s and
lower 80s across the Florida Peninsula; above 70 degrees from
southwestern Oregon to California, much of Nevada, southwest New
Mexico and southwest Texas; and in the 80s and 90s in the
Southwestern deserts.

   Two Haitian gunmen apparently aligned with a failed
coup attempt hijacked an airplane carrying a missionary group from
Haiti to Fort Lauderdale Monday, but surrendered after diverting
the plane to Miami, the FBI said.
   The gunmen, reportedly Haitian soldiers, threw their weapons
down as they turned themselves in, the FBI said. No one was hurt.
   The two men seized the twin-engine Cessna 402 at Cap Haitien
airport on Haiti's North Coast. They were armed with a .38-caliber
revolver, an assault rifle and a 40mm anti-tank shell, the FBI said.
   The hijackers were identified as Guillaume Berlioze, 25, and
Fadael Milord, 29, both of Port-au-Prince. They were scheduled to
appear in federal court Tuesday, where they could face charges of
air piracy and illegal weapons possession, said FBI spokesman Paul
Miller.
   The motive for the hijacking was not immediately clear, Miller
said.
   ``We haven't been able to pin that down, but there are
indications that they are against the government,'' he said.
   The hijackers, who were not in uniform, were deserting members
of Haiti's Dessalines Battalion, said police sources at Cap Haitien
airport who spoke on conditon of anonymity.
   The 750-member Dessalines was one of two military units involved
in the abortive against Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, Haiti's military
president.
   Avril appeared Monday to have quieted the sporadic acts of
rebellion by officers and troop units.
   The Cessna 402, owned by Missionary Aviation Fellowship of
Redlands, Calif., was hijacked at 11:30 a.m. and landed at Miami
International Airport at 2:30 p.m.
   A Fellowship spokeswoman, Donna Burns, said the plane held four
Haitians and three Americans, plus the two gunmen and the pilot,
Duer Smedley.
   ``They boarded at Cap Haitien,'' said Arlene Salac of the
Federal Aviation Administration's regional office in Atlanta.
   Ms. Burns said the men burst onto the departure ramp at the Cap
Haitien airport, fired weapons into the air and took over the
plane, and the pilot was ordered to fly immediately without filing
a flight plan.
   An American, who was not immediately identified, witnessed the
hijacking in Haiti and alerted Fellowship officials, Ms. Burns
said. He called Steve Adams, director of operations for MAF in Fort
Lauderdale, who then called authorities. Adams then called Ms.
Burns, she said.
   ``We're all relieved that it's finally over,'' said Jill
Lindsey, another Fellowship spokeswoman. ``Everything is fine;
we're all back to normal. Operations should be back to normal on
Wednesday.''
   The Fellowship is an international Christian aviation group
founded in 1945. It operates 145 aircraft in Third World countries
to provide rural aviation and radio service.
   The Fellowship first started flight service to Haiti in 1979,
flying doctors, medicines, supplies and mission and development
personnel. The service has been based at Executive Airport in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, since 1982.
   In October of 1987, a Fellowship single-engine engine Cessna was
hijacked in Suriname. The pilot was held by a rebel guerrilla group
before being released unharmed.

<HEAD>Investigators Confirm Arson in Abortion Clinic Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OCALA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arson caused fires at two women's clinics
that went up in flames hours before a massive pro-abortion rally
began in Washington, investigators said Monday.
   Accelerants were used in both fires, said Robert Creighton of
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   Investigators have not ruled out a link between the fires in
Ocalaand Fort Myers, which both occurred before dawn Sunday. Fort
Myers is on Florida's southwest coast. Ocala is about 150 miles to
the north.
   Meanwhile, about 70 abortion-rights activists riding in two
buses stopped in Ocala on their way home from the Washington rally
to hold a vigil at the gutted All Women's Health Clinic.
   ``We wanted to show the state of Florida that we will continue
to work to continue to have a choice,'' said Candice Slaughter, a
management consultant from the Tampa area.
   ``This does not deter us. It sets us back on our heels, but it
does not deter us,'' said Deborah Struthers, president of the Ocala
clinic and the Fort Myers Women's Health Center. She said both
facilities would reopen in temporary locations.
   The Ocala fire was the second in two weeks and appeared to be
the work of the arsonist who tried to burn the clinic March 31,
causing an estimated $60,000 damage, authorities said.
   Local anti-abortion activists denied responsibility in Sunday's
attacks, but said they hoped the clinics would not be able to
reopen.
   ``I don't condone the destruction of property, but I'm ecstatic
that they will not be able to perform abortions there,'' said Tom
Ranew, an adoption attorney who was arrested at a sit-in in Orlando
last October.
   Ms. Struthers said she had expected picketing at the Ocala
clinic by abortion opponents as a reaction to the march that
brought more than 300,000 demonstrators to Washington.
   ``I just didn't prepare well enough,'' she added. ``It just
never dawned on us that someone would be that disturbed and
unstable and aggressive and vicious.''

<HEAD>Philippines Military Announces Revamp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army chief of staff on Monday
announced a major reshaping of the armed forces to bring in younger
officers who are more experienced in fighting communist insurgents.
   Gen. Renato de Villa told a news conference 32 key positions
were involved. Half of the officers to be rotated are generals, he
added.
   The 163-000 strong military has been fighting communist
guerrillas for the last 20 years. It also faces a Moslem separatist
rebellion in the southern Philippines.
   De Villa dismissed speculation that the planned revamping was a
reaction to persistent news media reports of graft and corruption
in the military.
   ``This is to improve the firepower of the armed forces and this
was planned during the first quarter'' of the year, he said. ``It
is unfair to say that these officers were rotated because of graft
and corruption.''
   De Villa said another changeover is scheduled this year to
replace 10 generals who are retiring.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The devil doesn't get his due in ``Temptation,''
Vaclav Havel's reworking of the Faust legend, but then neither does
the audience.
   That's surprising considering the play by Czechoslovakia's
leading playwright, now in prison for dissident activities, has
been directed by a fellow Czech, Jiri Zizka. The director, with his
wife, Blanka, runs the highly regarded Wilma Theater in
Philadelphia where ``Temptation'' will go after its New York run.
   But you can't find the play because of Zizka's elaborate and
self-conscious staging that suffocates the drama and the actors in
it as well. Much of ``Temptation,'' which opened over the weekend
at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater, is set in a
science laboratory engaged in what seems to be some kind of
sinister work. The setting allows Zizka and set designer Jerry Rojo
to fill the stage with high-tech scenery, accented by slide
projections, smoke screens and weird sound effects.
   They are the same devices Zizka used several seasons ago in his
version of George Orwell's ``1984,'' done at the Joyce Theater. But
Orwell's novel, of a harrowing future, adapted well to Zizka's
stagey devices.
   Here they seem to overwhelm the actors including such fine
performers as David Strathairn who plays the Faust prototype, Dr.
Henry Foustka, and Bill Moor, as the mincing master of the science
institute.
   Foustka dabbles in black magic, and his sorcery conjures up a
mysterious stranger who sounds like Laurence Olivier and dresses
like a Bowery panhandler. Is the man a representative of the devil
or the repressive government that runs the laboratory? Or are they
one and the same?
   Havel's conclusion is surprisingly obvious. It just takes him a
long time _ 10 scenes spread over more than 2{ hours _ to get
there. In between, there are Foustka's dalliances with several
women in the lab including a young secretary who is a counterpart
to Faust's doomed Margaret. She's played here with remarkable
sympathy by Katherine Hiler.
   Havel's polemics get more of a workout in Foustka's verbal
sparring with that shabbily dressed stranger. Some of their
arguments crackle, displaying the passion Havel obviously has for
the free exchange of ideas. But in the end, their conversations are
overshadowed by Zizka's theatrical tricks, making the battle for
Foustka's soul not a very interesting war.

   A former police officer whose acquittal in the
beating death of a black man led to race riots in 1980 was arrested
along with a federal agent on drug charges, authorities said Monday.
   The former officer, Alex Marrero, 34, and federal drug agent
Jorge Villar, 44, were charged with conspiring to distribute
cocaine and conspiring to commit bribery after their weekend
arrests, which followed a sting operation.
   Marrero's acquittal in the beating death of businessman Arthur
McDuffie sparked a riot that left 18 people dead and caused $80
million in property damage in May 1980.
   U.S. attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Marrero and Villar had
offered to protect a man who was posing as a smuggler bringing
cocaine from the Bahamas into an area near Miami Beach. The man was
actually working with government agents.
   Marrero and Villar ``provided protection for this load of
cocaine and in return demanded a fee of $300,000,'' he said, and
Marrero got 10 percent of the fee in cash.
   According to an affidavit, Villar had certificates of deposit
worth more than $300,000 in a briefcase when he was arrested.
   ``Today we demonstrate no matter who you are or what you think
you know, if you deal in drugs you can be caught,'' Lehtinen told a
news conference.
   U.S. Magistrate William C. Turnoff ordered Marrero and Villar
back to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center, where they
have been held without bond since Saturday.
   Prosecutors asked that they be held as dangers to the community
and because of the risk they might flee. Turnoff said he would make
a decision on bonds for the two Tuesday.
   Diane Cossin, executive assistant to Lehtinen, said conviction
on the conspiracy and bribery charges would lead to automatic
10-year federal prison terms for the two men, and possible life
sentences. She said other charges may be filed.
   Marrero was suspended from the Metro-Dade force early in 1980
after an investigation revealed that McDuffie had been beaten to
death by police officers after a highway chase. Marrero, the chief
defendant in the case, was charged with second-degree murder.
   An all-white jury in Tampa later acquitted him and three other
officers of all criminal charges. Within hours, the Miami area,
especially suburban Liberty City, was rocked by riots that lasted
three days.
   Marrero later tried to rejoin the Metro-Dade police force, but
in 1981 a county hearing examiner upheld his firing. He has held
several jobs since, including security guard and personal bodyguard.

that had not been assigned by the federal government to Indian
tribes. Claimants who jumped the gun were referred to as
``Sooners.''
   On this date:
   In 1451, Queen Isabella I, who sponsored the voyages of
Christopher Columbus, was born in Madrigal, Spain.
   In 1509, Henry VIII ascended the throne of England following the
death of his father, Henry VII.

<HEAD>Connie Stevens Didn't Want to Play Uncaring, Part-Time Mother</HEAD>

   Connie Stevens didn't want a full-time role
when she signed on for ``Starting From Scratch.'' Then she began to
worry that her recurring character could be seen as an uncaring,
occasional mother.
   ``It's a more difficult role than I had anticipated,'' she said.
``I don't want to be a fool, or a mother who doesn't care and gives
the wrong message.''
   In the syndicated comedy series, which also stars Bill Daily,
she plays a runaway wife and mother who suddenly returns home after
five years. She wants to pick up where she left off and win back
her husband's affection.
   Stevens said she's trying to play the role as a mother who can't
cope, who ran away once but can't cut the umbilical cord.
   ``I don't see them getting back together,'' she said. ``If they
do, then it's another domestic comedy. The fun is that they're not
married. They haven't found anyone else, but they still cling to
each other. I didn't want to play a mother who just pops in the
door. Being a single mother, I know there are a lot of problems.
I've had trouble balancing the gags with the reality.''
   Stevens originally was supposed to be only a part-time character
in the show, which focuses on Daily and their two teen-agers.
   ``It looked perfect for me,'' she said. ``I could come in, play
a show and disappear. Then I found that as the show become popular
I was in every show and having to stay in Montreal, where it's
made.''
   Stevens said she was concerned, however, about where her
character was going.
   ``I didn't know where they were taking my character, and they
didn't know where the character was going,'' she said. ``We haven't
resolved it yet. It appealed to me because I'm a single parent
myself with two children.
   ``I felt I could make it interesting. I didn't want to be an
ex-wife who had no life of her own, no viewpoint of her own and who
was mercenary. In the pilot I was throwing credit cards around like
crazy.
   ``You can only get away with that if there's a great friendship
and a great love as a foundation. She's always borrowing money from
him. She's never balanced a checkbook. She can't hold a job.''
   This is the first series in a number of years for Stevens, who
is probably still best known for her role as Cricket on ``Hawaiian
Eye'' in the 1950s.
   She was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., but came to Los Angeles with her
father's band as a singer. She soon found her way into films.
   She played the goofy young singer-photographer in ``Hawaiian
Eye,'' which centered on two private detectives, played by Anthony
Eisley and Bob Conrad. Poncie Ponce was Kim, the taxi driver.
   The show frequently had crossovers with ``77 Sunset Strip.'' She
and Edd ``Kookie'' Byrnes of that show recorded the hit song
``Kookie, Kookie, Lend Me Your Comb.''
   ``The entire budget for all the actors was $1,100 a week,'' she
said. ``I got $50 a week more than anyone else, because I let them
take top billing.''
   There's talk of making a reunion movie. Stevens said she has
written a story for the movie that brings all the characters back
and serves as a pilot for four new spinoff characters.
   Almost 30 years after playing Cricket, Stevens still looks young
and vivacious. In 1974 she played a Marilyn Monroe-type character
in the TV movie ``The Sex Symbol.''
   Stevens lived in England when she was going through her divorce
from singer Eddie Fisher, the father of her two daughters. While in
England, she worked on her last regular series, ``The Des O'Connor
Show'' in 1971.
   ``I took a house outside of London,'' she said. ``I learned to
deal with people again. The English are great for that.''

   After leaving the crew to set up the
next shot in the smoky nightclub, Mark Rosner walks purposefully up
the street toward his office trailer.
   He passes a woman with a glazed look in her eyes, rouge-smeared
cheeks, frightful blond hair and snow-white fingernails.
   Rosner shakes his head when she is out of earshot. ``Extras
never look as good as real people,'' he says with a sigh.
   In the office, Rosner sinks into a corner to talk about ``Dream
Street,'' the series he is writing and directing for NBC. It
premieres Thursday in a 90-minute special before moving to its
regular hour-long time period on Fridays.
   From the first twang of the guitar on ``After Midnight'' and the
best opening credits since ``Miami Vice,'' it's clear this is a
different kind of television series.
   Already dubbed variously ``dirtysomething'' or
``twentysomething,'' a comparison with the hit ABC series
``thirtysomething'' that comes from the same executive producers,
Ed Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, ``Dream Street'' is a
no-holds-barred tale of 20s, when young people are hit with the
realities of adulthood.
   Dale Midkiff (``Elvis and Me'') stars as Denis Debeau, who takes
over the family refrigeration business after his father has a
stroke, bypassing his anguished failure of an older brother, Harry
(Peter Frechette). Thomas Calabro plays Denis' best friend, Joey
Coltrera, who is joining his father's business, too _ organized
crime.
   Rosner offers his own catch-phrase for the show.
   ``I started calling it `rock 'n' roll television,' because I
don't want people to call it like `blue-collar' television. To me
that sounds like real '50s, kitchen-sink, good-for-you television,
and that's not it,'' he said. ``The fact that the characters are
working-class is the context in which the stories take place. To
me, what it's really about is being in your 20s and trying to be a
grownup for the first time, really.
   ``To me all the great rock 'n' roll is about that stuff. ... And
also just because it moves real fast and it looks real hot and the
energy is real high on this show, that handle seems to make sense
to me.''
   The only thing missing from a rock 'n' roll show set in New
Jersey is the Boss.
   ``No one mentions Bruce Springsteen. We don't use his music,''
Rosner said. ``I think we owe him a debt in that the texture of the
show and the kind of stories we tell are very much in the vein of
the songs that he sings, but we're not ridin' on his coattails or
trying exploit him or anything like that.
   ``There's so much Springsteen on the page and on the screen, to
have him on the soundtrack would be superfluous.''
   ``Dream Street'' derived from a network executive's suggestion
for a show that was ``young, sexy, urban.'' Zwick and Herskovitz
developed the idea, but ``thirtysomething'' was picked up in the
meantime and ``Dream Street'' put on hold until Rosner took it
over. He had met Zwick and Herskovitz at the American Film
Institute when all three were aspiring film directors.
   Herskovitz, in an interview in his office in Studio City,
Calif., where he was overseeing ``thirtysomething,'' said he and
Zwick, who was off filming a movie, ``could not possibly have
considered doing the second show if we didn't have someone like
Mark.''
   ``Ed and I have been able to be very influential in a lot of the
conceptual and creative elements of the show, but at the same time
what we share with Mark is the idea of what it means to be a
filmmaker. I don't tell him how to make his shots,'' Herskovitz
said.
   What ``Dream Street'' does have in common with
``thirtysomething'' is reliance on character more than plot. Joni
Goldstein (Cecil Hoffman) is engaged to Joey, but only her cynical
roommate, Kara (Christine Moore), realizes what kind of life she's
in for. Denis, meanwhile, courts a reluctant elementary school
teacher (Jo Anderson). His youngest brother (David Gray) runs wild,
drinking and carousing. That this behavior meets with big brother's
approval, at least in the pilot, is bound to raise some eyebrows.
   Rosner, who is from Valley Stream, N.Y., said he was urged to
consider other shooting locations, but insisted on filming ``Dream
Street'' in New Jersey.
   ``Anything you'd want to do in a real urban show is right here
within five or eight miles of Hoboken,'' Rosner said. ``Plus,
you've got the incomparable view of the city, the Emerald City
across the river, which, believe me, they don't have in Knoxville
or Vancouver.''

<HEAD>Wary Republicans, Embarrassed in Indiana, Eye Wyoming House Race</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic national chairman said he
couldn't resist, so he didn't. ``Republicans,'' Ron Brown said,
``read my lips: Jill Long.''
   That's hardly a household name, but the Republicans who heard
him certainly recognized it. Jill Long is a very junior member of
Congress from Indiana. She's just won the seat once held by Vice
President Dan Quayle.
   Now the Republicans are battling to defend another House seat in
Wyoming, where they have nothing to gain but a lot to lose.
   One more special election defeat and their national campaign
managers are going to have a hard time convincing anybody that
their new-look strategy for House contests is going to work
anywhere.
   So far they are down two in special House elections in 1989,
losing narrowly in Indiana and overwhelmingly in a Democratic
district in Alabama.
   Now they are on defense again, trying to hold a Republican seat.
   ``Wyoming's next and I think we've got to fight like the devil
to win,'' said Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater.
   This time the laboratory is a whole state, the at-large Wyoming
House seat Richard B. Cheney gave up to become secretary of
defense. The election will be held on April 26.
   Republican Cheney held it by widening margins in six elections.
   But Democrat John Vinich is the better-known contender of the
candidates to succeed Cheney, after narrowly losing a 1988 Senate
race. Vinich, 38, is a state senator. The Republican candidate is
Craig Thomas, 55, a state representative who casts himself as ``the
kind of moderate conservative'' Wyoming voters chose in Cheney and
in their two GOP senators.
   The National Republican Congressional Committee is concentrating
on the Wyoming contest with both money and manpower, its leaders
worrying that their national game plan could be undone before the
game really gets started.
   They are looking to 1990 and beyond, and weren't figuring on
trouble in 1989.
   But that's what they've got.
   Edward J. Rollins, co-chairman of the congressional campaign
committee, took the job this year with a commitment to turn the
trend that has kept Republicans in the House minority since 1954.
Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the new minority whip, says he'll
make that political offensive part of his daily agenda on the House
floor.
   The premise is that national aid, advice and issues can, in
time, reverse the Republicans' chronic minority status in the House.
   To date, the movement has been in the opposite direction. After
the 1988 elections, the Republicans had 176 House seats, a net loss
of three. Now they have 174, pending the outcome in Wyoming. The
Democrats have 260.
   They're sending funds and campaign help into Wyoming, too. But
they have kept a lower profile, enabling their side to complain
about outside influence in the Republican campaign.
   Not that outside aid necessarily works. The GOP tried it in
Indiana, to no avail. ``We should not have lost that race,'' said
Atwater. ``That's inexcusable.''
   The pattern there is one that should heighten GOP concerns about
Wyoming.
   The Indiana election was for a House seat opened when Dan Coats
resigned to succeed Quayle in the Senate. Rep. Long had challenged
Quayle for the Senate in 1986 and Coats for the House in 1988,
losing by landslide margins both times. She never shut down the
House campaign.
   So she was the better-known candidate. National issues
notwithstanding, she made headway by linking the Republican nominee
to two county tax increases. She won by 1,775 votes.
   While it was a Republican district, that wasn't the case until
Quayle ousted a Democratic congressman to launch his own political
career in 1976.
   Cheney succeeded a Democrat when he first won the Wyoming seat
in 1978.
   Like Rep. Long in Indiana, Democrat Vinich in Wyoming has
renewed a campaign that hardly had ended when he started running
again. His was a 1988 Senate race, and in one-seat Wyoming, the
House race is statewide, too.
   Vinich came within 1,322 votes of upsetting Republican Sen.
Malcolm Wallop last fall. Now he says that in the House, he'll be
able to instruct the Democratic majority on Wyoming concerns. ``The
majority party has some members with senseless ideas and no
understanding of the West,'' he says.
   Atwater has said that Democrats who blur the party issues can be
tough. ``The smartest Democrats are those who create a situation so
you can't differentiate,'' he told a conservative group last week.
``That's what happened in Alabama.''

   One after another, proud symbols of
cities and empires are disappearing from public view in Italy,
victims of pollution and discouraging testimony that restoration
can't rescue every monument and artwork.
   In Florence, the 15th-century gilded panels on the east entrance
to the Baptistry _ a door so beautiful Michelangelo thought it was
fit for paradise _ are destined for specially sealed glass chambers
inside a museum.
   Now blackened and devoured by automobile pollution, the 10
bronze panels were done over 23 years by Lorenzo Ghiberti before
his death in 1455 to depict the Creation and other Old Testament
stories. Today they are being delicately restored, one by one, to
much of their shining splendor.
   But since no known chemical coating can protect them from car
exhaust, the panels will be replaced in the door by copies; the
originals will end up inside the oxygen-less, humidity-controlled
chambers of the museum across from Florence's cathedral.
   Ghiberti's work, dear to Florentine hearts, has good company.
   Earlier this decade, the four gilded bronze horses on the facade
of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice were placed, after restoration,
inside the church, and their places outside were taken by copies.
   The statues outside Milan's cathedral also are going inside, and
Rome will not soon see its symbol back at the city hall square atop
Capitoline Hill: The 1,800-year-old gilded bronze statue of Emperor
Marcus Aurelius astride his noble horse, recently restored, is too
frail to withstand the pollution and vibration of Rome's relentless
traffic.
   Restoration has had some heady days in recent years. There have
been gala unveilings of Venetian canalside palaces, the emergence
of Michelangelo's bright colors during the cleaning of the Sistine
Chapel ceiling and the titilating discovery that Adam and Eve's fig
leaves were a cover-up added to Masaccio's fresco in a Florence
church.
   But less attention has gone to the sobering realization that,
despite the marriage of high technology to restoration, restorers
often watch helplessly as monuments crumble and others, like
Ghiberti's masterpiece, must be removed from their glorious
settings to survive.
   In its current state, ``technology is more suitable to
diagnosis'' than prevention of the decay, said Alessandra Melucco,
who directed restoration of the statue.
   And what do you do with a monument like the 65-foot-high Arch of
Settimius Severus, which isn't easily moved, along with its
spectacular setting in the Roman Forum?
   ``In a generation, we are losing an historical heritage of 2,000
years,'' said Roberto Nardi, an archaeologist and restorer who was
part of a team that restored one-half of the arch, one of Rome's
most badly damaged monuments.
   ``What took 2,000 years to erode, then took 50, now takes five
years.''
   Like some other restorers, Nardi said its time to rethink the
approach to restoration.
   In the case of the arch, restorers had to stop work because they
ran out of money from a special fund established by Parliament
earlier this decade. The restored half is more or less white, while
the untouched half is coffee brown with soot and grime.
   Nardi says they would have stopped anyway because they saw that
pollution was damaging the monument as fast as they cleaned it.
   ``In five, six, 10 years,'' said fellow restorer Luisa Barucci,
``it will be the same argument. The black crust (will return).
Italy always waits until these things are falling apart.''
   Restoration, said Nardi, should be resumed only when the state
begins a program of regular maintenance.
   ``We stopped work but maintenance didn't begin,'' he said.
   The arch was restored with a natural material, limestone
plaster, that lasts about five years. The temptation is to use
harsh, plastic resins that could last longer, but in some cases,
the coatings made it impossible for the stone to ``breathe'' and
the coatings themselves were difficult to remove without damaging
the monument.
   At a recent conference in Florence, experts called for more
chemical research specifically to aid restorers.
   Arnold Wolff, in charge of restoring the Cathedral of Cologne in
West Germany, projected slides that showed how in less than a
century, the face of a stone angel was disfigured by pollution.
   ``We desperately need a chemical agent to protect stone,'' he
said.
   Sponsored by ENI, Italy's state energy company, the conference
also discussed the role of private companies.
   Alitalia, for example, backed the cleanup of the angels on
Castel Sant'Angelo Bridge across the Tiber. Olivetti sponsored the
cleaning of Leonardo da Vinci's ``Last Supper,'' a restoration now
being criticized as too slow and perhaps faulty.
   Offers of private funding are difficult to dismiss in Italy,
where cultural projects occupy a miniscule slice of the
deficit-ridden national budjet.
   But Luis Monreal, director of the California-based Getty
Conservation Institute and a speaker at the conference, maintained
that ``the private sector is more project-oriented and doesn't have
an overall view.''
   Private donors often want to work only on the most famous works
or something that will capture public attention rather than on
works most in need of restoration, said Roberto Boddi, an art
conservator at Florence's Fortezza da Basso, one of Italy's leading
restoration centers.
   Adriano La Regina, Rome's superintendent of archaeology for the
past 12 years, said money is lacking for regular maintenance.
   He added in an interview at his office at the Forum that his
department asked for the equivalent of about $150 million last year
for a minimal, three-year plan of restoration and maintenance,
including the needs of museums.
   Parliament approved only $6.6 million.
   Nardi said his calculations indicate that it would cost about
$15,000 a year to maintain a major monument in Rome, about ``the
same cost of providing a car and driver to a deputy'' in Parliament.
   La Regina said the underlying problem is not money but pollution.
   ``We need severe laws, to be implemented very quickly: filters
on cars, abolition of harmful fuels and traffic bans,'' he said.

amid the faded snapshots and other keepsakes, there rests a plastic
pickle, a souvenir of a splendiferous tomorrow that came and went.
   Fifty years ago, in the interlude between the Great Depression
and World War II, the pickle's owner had gone to Flushing, Queens
to discover a sleek and glittering future had set up camp on 1,216
acres of reclaimed ash heap.
   The visitor to the 1939 New York World's Fair came away with
visions of televisions and superhighways, of nylon stockings and
automatic milking machines, of man-made lightning and aerated bread
_ all this and a pickle pin, one of six million such souvenirs
distributed at the H.J. Heinz pavilion.
   They saw wonders like the Walker-Gordon Rotolactor, a revolving
platform on which five cows were showered, dried with sterile
towels and mechanically milked. They watched the 7-foot-tall
Westinghouse robot, Elektro, and his ``moto-dog,'' Sparko. They
toured 200 buildings _ each of them spectacular _ 175 sculptures
and 105 murals.
   ``Everything was unfamiliar _ they were dazzled by what the
future could be,'' says Barbara Cohen, author with Steven Heller
and Seymour Chwast of ``Trylon and Perisphere: The 1939 New York
World's Fair.''
   That was the aim of the fair's organizers _ that, and to bring
tourist dollars to New York City. The city's business elite had
been impressed by the 1933 Century of Progress fair in Chicago.
They proposed a fair to mark the 150th anniversary of George
Washington's inauguration in New York.
   Grover A. Whelan, former police commissioner, head of a
distillery and the bow-tied barker-boss of the 1939 World's Fair,
said at the time: ``By giving a clear and orderly interpretation of
our own age, the fair will project the average man into the World
of Tomorrow.''
   The symbols of the fair were two abstract shapes, at once
classical and modernistic _ the Trylon, a 610-foot spike, and the
globular Perisphere, a theater twice the size of Radio City Music
Hall which was home to Democracity, a multimedia depiction of the
city of the future.
   Radio commentator H.V. Kaltenborn narrated the six-minute show:
``As day fades into night, each man seeks a home, for here are
children, comfort, neighbors, recreation _ the good life of a
well-planned city.''
   The same theme was struck at the fair's most popular exhibit,
General Motors' Futurama, where 552 moving chairs carried fairgoers
past a diorama depicting the United States, circa 1960 _ a place
where seven-lane, radio-controlled highways directed
teardrop-shaped cars at 100 mph.
   In the future, the narrator said, cars would be air-conditioned.
He was right. He said they would cost as little as $200. He was
wrong.
   ``The land is much greener than it was in 1939...Men love their
fields and gardens better and more wisely,'' Life magazine wrote of
Futurama.
   Spectators often waited in line two hours to see Futurama. But
there was so much to do, and so little time!
   They ran to the AT&amp;T building to see the VODER, a speech
synthesizer, and to enter the contest for a free long-distance
call. They ran to the Dairy World of Tomorrow to meet Elsie the
Cow. They ran to the DuPont exhibit to witness the wonders of
nylon, Lucite and cellophane, and to RCA to see the first regular
broadcasts of television.

   The home of tomorrow was highlighted at General Electric, which
offered a kitchen with appliances that talked; at Westinghouse,
which pitted ``Mrs. Drudge,'' who did dishes the old-fashioned way,
against ``Mrs. Modern,'' who used a dishwasher; at Tomorrow Town, a
collection of 15 model homes.
   The fair was not entirely commercial _ 60 nations opened
pavilions in Flushing Meadows, including the Soviet Union _ but
there is no doubt that the World of Tomorrow was a world of
salesmanship.
   Writer E.B. White hoped to find ``the field of honor'' at the
fair, but found instead that ``it was merely Heinz jousting with
Beech-Nut _ the same old contest on a somewhat larger field, with
accommodations for more spectators, and somewhat better facilities
all round.''
   Others found fault with the fair's crowd-pleasing amusement
zone, which featured a Parachute Jump and Billy Rose's Aquacade, as
well as more tawdry diversions like sideshows and bare-breasted
women _ offered, of course, as educational exhibits on the
lifestyles of Amazons.
   The amusements took precedence in 1940, when it became clear
that the fair was in trouble. With the advent of World War II, the
Soviet pavilion and others closed. The Trylon and Perisphere were
in bad repair, temporary structures that were not designed to
withstand the weather.
   More importantly, the fair was losing money. Most critics argued
that the 75-cent admission fee was too high. A full day at the fair
for two people, including meals, cost about $7 _ a high tariff for
the end of the Depression.
   Fair officials expected 50 million visitors in 1939. Attendance
fell short of that mark after two years running. The fair lost
nearly $19 million.
   This did not prevent New York from trying another world's fair
at the same spot 25 years later. That fair, too, was a financial
fiasco, and it is not recalled with the same intensity and fondness
as its predecessor.
   ``It seemed more tawdry than the 1939 World's Fair,'' said
author Cohen.
   The people who attended the 1939 fair were not so world-wise as
their children would be. They traveled less, had no television to
bombard them with images of an unobtainable good life, had never
eaten food of foreign lands.
   ``It was a simpler time. Truly,'' Cohen says.
   Cohen operates an antique bookstore for New York topics. The
children and grandchildren of fairgoers visit her shop and buy
Trylon and Perisphere ring-toss sets, ashtrays, bookends, pennants,
doilies, postcards, license plates, as well as pins that say, ``I
have seen the future.''
   Why do people who were not alive when a fair blossomed in
Flushing seek out these mementos? ``It's a gene memory,'' she says.
   One souvenir remains buried at Flushing Meadows: a time capsule
containing bits of 1930s life, so that people who lived in the
future foretold by the fair could know a bit more about the past.
   Denizens of the future will find sheet music to ``Flat Foot
Floogie.'' A Mickey Mouse cup. Newsreel footage, including the film
of Jesse Owen's triumph in the 100-meter dash at the 1936 Olympics.
Nine New York daily newspapers, among them the Daily Worker. The
book ``Gone with the Wind.''
   But the ultimate testimony to the optimism of a time and place
before Hiroshima, before fears of environmental catastrophe, before
Auschwitz, comes in the instructions engraved on a plaque above the
time capsule:
   Do not open until the year 6939.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They are the Johnny Appleseeds of the '80s,
scattering vegetable and flower seeds across the land to help feed
the poor, brighten the lives of the sick and handicapped. Operating
from cramped quarters in an old office building in Washington, the
America the Beautiful Fund has found a way to produce millions of
dollars worth of food at minimal expense.

   A reporter's telephone call interrupted Otis
Butler's breakfast. He had been eating a tomato out of his freezer.
   He'd grown it himself. In a garden carved out of a vacant lot _
in the Bronx.
   Otis Butler is a retired baker, and president of the Union
Prospect Area Block Association. But when he talks tomatoes, he
sounds like a farmer.
   ``We need rain,'' he says. ``We had six weeks of hot weather
last summer, hot and dry. It knocked our tomatoes down. We didn't
even enter the 58th Street horticulture fair, but when I saw
tomatoes that won prizes, I said what the heck, our tomatoes are as
good as these. We could have won a prize.
   ``Nobody had real good tomatoes last summer.''
   An unlikely midmorning conversation, an unlikely farmer, talking
about crops grown from seeds from an unlikely place: The
seed-jammed office of the America the Beautiful Fund in an aging
office building a few blocks from the White House.
   It may be the only office in Washington in which the top drawer
of a green file cabinet is labeled ``Prairie Grass,'' the middle
drawer is labeled ``Bulk Flowers and Muskmelon,'' the bottom drawer
is labeled ``Corn, Beans, Pea Packets.''
   From these shoebox quarters, and operating on a shoestring, the
fund distributes donated vegetable, herb and flower seeds and bulbs
to local projects across America.
   America the Beautiful Fund turns out to be four part-time
workers, a handful of volunteers and a full-time staff of three _
wildlife biologist Paul Bruce Dowling, founder and executive
director; former actress Nanine Bilski, national projects director,
and anthropologist Nat Thomas, who spends much of his time packing
envelopes with seed packets.
   They are Johnny Appleseeds with a computer _ and a far broader
list of seeds to give away. They figure their ``Operation Green
Plant'' reaches into one county in 10, maybe even one in three.
   The idea is simplicity itself: Persuade a dozen of the nation's
seed companies to donate _ rather than destroy _ ``last year's''
seeds, on the promise they will go only to people who would not be
in a position to buy them at the corner hardware store.
   Persuade APA Transport and other trucking companies to bring in
the seeds at no charge. Persuade local poverty agencies, 4-H clubs,
church groups, neighborhood associations, refugee centers, drug
rehabilitation centers, county health departments, soup kitchens,
nursing homes _ even hospices for AIDS patients _ to start a
gardening project. Charge them only the cost of shipping the seeds
_ 50 cents a pound.
   For $12 in shipping fees, a group could get enough seed to grow
two acres of tomatoes and one acre each of corn, lettuce,
cucumbers, green peppers and squash.
   The idea started in 1980 with 60 beautification projects. It
took off when the new environmental ethic matched up with the
nation's dawning awareness that there was hunger on the street
corners, in the small towns and even on the farms of this
prosperous, fertile and sometimes over-fed land.
   Last season, 15,000 groups asked for, received and distributed
500,000 packets of seeds and 50,000 pounds of bulk seeds.
   That's enough, Dowling estimates, to provide ``over 70 million
pounds of fresh, nutritious food, grown by and for hungry people at
the cost of a penny a pound.''
   ``It is an idea so simple and so basic that it works,'' he says.
   The value of the food grown last year, by Dowling's
seat-of-the-pants estimate, is $20 million.
   This year, those figures will double, Dowling and Ms. Bilski
confidently predict. They should know. Much of the seeds for this
spring's planting already have been shipped.

   Most seeds go to the rural poor. But many go to inner-city
projects such as Otis Butler's in the Bronx, one of hundreds in the
New York City metropolitan area.
   Butler says 18 adults and a handful of kids raised enough food
to feed themselves and 30 other families. So successful has the
project been that participants had to buy freezers to store up what
couldn't be eaten fresh _ including, of course, Otis' breakfast
tomato.
   ``There's a little work attached to it,'' he says. ``But when
you look at what you've grown _ oh, God!''
   Says Ms. Bilski: ``Do you know that Chinese proverb: `Give a man
a fish and he'll eat for a day; teach him to fish and he'll eat for
a lifetime'?''
   Dowling: ``Money's not appreciated the way seeds are. Seeds are
a chance to do something for oneself _ a chance to put God's own
magic to work.''
   Ms. Bilski: ``We got word about what happened when we sent
paperwhite narcissus bulbs to a project for AIDS patients. The
doctors told us about one man who had been anti-social all his
life. Then he grew some paperwhites and brought them around to the
bedsides of other patients. It gave them joy and it gave him joy. A
doctor said maybe this was the one positive thing he was waiting to
do before he died.''
   Dowling: ``If we could figure out how to put growing plants into
the drug culture, maybe they could be part of the solution.''
   ``Operation Green Plant'' operates with a minimum of that
Washington perennial: red tape. A one-page flyer, headlined ``FREE
SEEDS'' is sent to all who ask, all who America the Beautiful think
might be interested.
   ``We are offering between 50 and 750 packets for the projects of
local groups on the basis of availability and relative need, for
volunteer work in growing food for the needy, growing plants for
charitable plant sales; to beautify neighborhoods, grow plants for
the elderly, the handicapped and the confined, start new
educational programs to show that growing plants can give people
and communities new hope as they help to beautify and nourish
America,'' the flyer says.
   America the Beautiful operates on a budget of about $250,000 in
contributions from people and foundations. If Dowling's
calculations are correct, it means every donated dollar yields 280
pounds of food.
   Enough money has been hard to come by, Dowling says. He sent out
appeals to foundations this winter for the $150,000 that would be
required to enlarge the operation's bulk seed warehouse in Lorton,
Va., making possible a vast expansion of the program, but got no
takers.
   Foundations are hard to convert, he says. They're in the habit
of funding more sophisticated proposals than one that merely calls
for sending seeds to people.
   Dowling says 50 packets of seeds will be sent _ no questions
asked _ to any organization that promises to distribute them.
Projects seeking more are asked to first tell how the seeds are to
be used.
   ``If they write a letter,'' he says, ``that's good enough for
us.''
   What goes back is a seed grant _ in the fullest sense of that
term.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The poet John Keats called Oxford ``the finest
city in the world.'' But despite its manifest wealth of
architecture and the riches of its libraries, Oxford University is
caught in a funding squeeze that has forced it to go hat-in-hand
looking for money. Proud Oxford is learning a lesson in humility.

<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the fourth week of Hilary Term, the
Sunday sermon at the University Church of St. Mary the Virgin was
on the grace of humility.
   Humility has been preached to Oxford since 1684, under a pious
bequest, though it is not so easily learned. ``To call a man an
Oxford man,'' the 19th-century prime minister W.E. Gladstone said,
``is to pay him the highest compliment that can be paid to a human
being.''
   In recent years, however, Oxford has been learning daily,
practical lessons on the humility of reduced circumstances.
   For the first time in 442 years, there is no Regius Professor of
Greek. The university said it couldn't afford to hire one, nor a
Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History.
   There are 140 vacant teaching positions at Oxford and members of
the Association of University Teachers, upset at not getting raises
this year, are refusing to participate in final examinations.
   The Oxford Playhouse closed for lack of funds in 1987, the
Bodleian Library is looking for $172,000 to buy acid-free cardboard
boxes to store rare books, and the Oxford Union, where generations
of politicians have polished their sneers and ripostes, had to be
bailed out by a Japanese donation.
   Just as Oscar Wilde, as an Oxford undergraduate, found it
``harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china,'' so the
university finds it increasingly difficult to live up to its
reputation. Now it has gone, hat-in-hand, to its fiercely
independent colleges, to wealthy corporations and alumni.
   ``The university now is not filling five out of six vacancies,''
says Henry Drucker, an American academic who directs the University
Development Office's campaign to raise about $385 million within
five years. The goal includes $70 million for an endowment.
   ``We are not in any way replacing our stock of old people, who
are all getting fed up and cheesed off,'' says Rosemary Fennell,
secretary of the Oxford chapter of the teachers association, which
represents about one-third of the faculty.
   Throughout the university system, the number of faculty members
under the age of 35 has fallen from 29 percent to 15 percent in the
last decade.
   ``Education is undervalued in this society,'' Ms. Fennell says.
   ``I think the government has some responsibility, for the
long-term fabric of society, to insure that you have a
well-educated citizenry, and that you are doing the primary
research. And who's going to fund Sanskrit?''
   Despite its manifest wealth of architecture and the riches of
its libraries, Oxford shares in a funding squeeze which affects all
of Britain's university system. The number of students nationwide
has dipped 3 percent since 1982, and the institutions project a
combined five-year deficit of $128 million by 1992.
   Oxford has begun giving merit raises of up to 30 percent for
outstanding teachers, but Cambridge University believes it can keep
its best and brightest on annual salaries averaging about $47,600.
   Cambridge is attempting to cut its faculty by 5 percent.
   Oxford has the distinction of educating the architects of this
new era: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Education Secretary
Kenneth Baker, who envisions ``market-led, multifunded'' higher
education.
   In practical terms, that means a greater dependence on private
support, loans instead of grants for students, and even talk about
``privatizing'' the universities.
   Symptoms of distress are hidden and Oxford remains, to the
visitor, what the poet John Keats called ``the finest city in the
world.''
   The days of peaches, cream and champagne have not ended. They
are dished out every year to heads of houses and other nobs as the
benefaction of Lord Crewe, a 17th-century bishop.
   Birdsong and the distant tolling of bells still soothe the
wanderer beyond Christ Church Meadow, which commands an
unobstructed view of the ``dreaming spires'' celebrated by Matthew
Arnold, though the whine of traffic on the High Street may shatter
a reverie even there.

   Black tie is still required for men and gowns for the women who
debate at the Oxford Union, though their audience is mostly swathed
in denim and leather. Behind the imposing walls and fences which
keep outsiders in their place, the lawns and flower beds are
immaculate and increasing numbers of students want in. Applications
rose 10 percent last year and 21 percent the year before.
   Oxford's facade is one of unassailable immortality, a place
where New College is 620 years old. But change is constant, even in
the building stones that replace those worn down by corrosive rain.
   Just this year, the university enacted a sexual harassment code
putting undergraduates off-limits from the occasional wayward don.
Keble College became the last college to ban sconcing, a
traditional drinking challenge which involved gulping a quart of
beer at one go. And, after eight centuries, the university has
gotten around to publishing an alumni magazine, emanating from the
same Development Office that shortly will be soliciting funds from
140,000 living graduates.
   It also promised to stop using the word ``alumni'' after being
scolded by two grads for adopting that ``appalling American
expression'' for the distinguished crowd that includes 24 prime
ministers and as many winners of Nobel Prizes; Charles and John
Wesley, the founders of Methodism; Cardinal John Henry Newman;
Christopher Wren, the architect of St. Paul's Cathedral; literary
lights including Samuel Johnson, Graham Greene, T.S. Eliot and
William Golding; and Roger Bannister, the first four-minute miler,
now Sir Roger and warden of Oxford's Pembroke College.
   It was the Oxford-Cambridge tradition and style of learning that
Harvard University set out to mimic. Now Oxford is trying to copy
Harvard's financial savvy.
   ``Harvard has an endowment of $4 billion,'' Drucker says. ``We
have an endowment of $13.8 million, which puts us ahead in the
U.K., but $13.8 million is nothing.''
   Drucker thinks the university needs to do hardheaded things such
as copyrighting its emblem and collecting royalties from T-shirts.
Harvard earns more than $100,000 a year from licensing its emblem _
in Japan.
   Felicity Spector, president of the Oxford University Student
Union, worries about the funding appeal's implications for other
British universities.
   ``If the government expects other universities and polytechnics
to do the same, they don't have Oxford's contacts, and won't be
able to raise as much,'' she says.
   ``We are at the moment an intellectually elite university. I
don't see anything wrong with that, except I don't like it that the
intellectual elite command the greatest resources.''
   The fund drive has already brought a $35 million pledge from
Squibb, the pharmaceutical giant, for neuroscientific research;
$10.5 million from G.D. Searle and Co. for glycobiology research;
and an anonymous pledge of funds to hire a Regius Professor of
Greek.
   While the university is raising money, the colleges are looking
out for themselves. Somerville, one of the two remaining women-only
colleges, recently celebrated raising its endowment fund to $3.5
million, and is naming its new buildings for its famous graduate,
Mrs. Thatcher.
   The Oxford Union was in danger of dissolving under a six-figure
overdraft until the Mitsubishi Trust last year pledged $1.72
million over four years.
   Union president Adam Bruce says that will provide for the
replacement of peeling wallpaper in the debating hall, the
threadbare carpets in its common rooms and restore the skylight
over the billiard tables.
   Annoyance at the government unites large segments of the Oxford
Union, the more proletarian student union and the faculty, which in
1985 took the unprecedented step of denying Mrs. Thatcher an
honorary degree.
   ``There hasn't been a motion in the years I have been here that
was pro-government and has passed,'' Bruce says.

   Professor Archie Campbell peers into
the future and sees fish, a thousand tons of the sea's bounty
heaped high on a magic cart gliding effortlessly above the floor.
   Campbell is joking, but he and his colleagues in the new
Research Center in Superconductivity are well aware that the
British government expects some practical, patentable return on its
investment.
   ``We are in a bit of a glass house to see whether we can produce
something of interest to the public, and commercial firms in
particular,'' says Peter Duncumb, the center's director. ``I think
that's all to the good.''
   Cambridge University, whose scientific tradition stretches from
Sir Isaac Newton to Stephen Hawking, author of the contemporary
best seller, ``A Brief History of Time,'' seems the obvious choice
for the government's first venture in interdisciplinary research
centers.
   Appropriately, the center is in the new building of the
Cavendish Laboratory, famous for its pioneering work in splitting
the atom in the 1930s.
   Superconductors have zero-resistance to electric currents and
defy gravity by repelling a magnetic field. But they now work only
at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, about minus 390 degress F,
which limits their potential.
   The elusive room-temperature superconductor conjures up visions
of 2,000-mph trains, smaller and faster computers, electromagnetic
launchers to replace rockets. Visions, too, of bags and bags of
profits.
   The center is the first of nine interdisciplinary research
centers established by the government, with an initial commitment
of $9.3 million for six years.
   ``We're well-funded,'' Campbell says carefully, ``by British
standards.''
   The U.S. government spends about $90 million a year on
superconductivity research, and a White House advisory committee
proposes spending $30 million more.
   Cambridge is sometimes thought of as the scientific half of
Oxbridge, as Britain's two oldest and greatest universities are
often called. But Oxford, 70 miles to the southwest, is also
getting an interdisciplinary research center _ in molecular
sciences _ and Cambridge's literary heritage includes Milton,
Marlowe, Wordsworth and Dryden.
   Government grant reductions which led to Oxford's public appeal
for funds have also been felt in the Cavendish Laboratory.
   ``We have good people, so we can get research grants from the
research councils, but the difficulty today is that the backup in
the case of laboratory space, technician support and general
running costs is no longer adequate,'' says John Deakin, secretary
to the department of physics and the Cavendish Laboratory.
   Technicians, he says, have been lost to better-paid jobs in
private industry in the Cambridge Science Park. Ironically, the
park is run by Trinity College and plows part of its profits back
into the university.
   Denis Noble, professor of cardiovascular physiology at Oxford
and founder of the lobbying group Save British Science, says that
funding is an old problem.
   He cites the case of Charles Babbage, a Cambridge experimenter
in mechanical calculators who lost his government funding in 1842.
   ``The mind boggles to think that Britain might have had an IBM
in the 19th century,'' Nobler says. ``We could have had a world
lead in that area.''

   OXFORD, England (AP) _ Applicants need not be incredibly clever
to be admitted, Oxford University says, but the old school tie
still helps.
   ``Everyone who is accepted has a reasonable standard of
intelligence; a very small minority is brilliant,'' says the
catalog, which also notes that an IQ of 130 is considered just
average on the campus.
   Oxford admits about 3,000 ``freshers'' every year, selected from
about 10,000 applicants. About half of those who apply, and half of
those admitted, are from expensive ``public schools'' such as Eton,
Rugby or Winchester, says Ted Baskerville, admissions officer at
the university.
   About 7 percent of British schoolchildren attend public schools,
although the figure jumps to nearly 20 percent after age 16 when
many students leave state-funded schools.
   Only in 1981 did the proportion of state schoolers top 50
percent at Oxford.
   Oxbridge, as Oxford and and its sister university Cambridge are
collectively known, has always been the express lane to power. For
instance, 14 of the 22 members of the Cabinet, including Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, are Oxbridge graduates.
   Students apply for admission to a college, though they will
receive their degrees from the university.
   Many students receive grants from local governments to cover
fees of about $7,400 a year, and ``no one need be kept out by
shortage of funds,'' says Baskerville.
   Americans and other foreign arts students pay an additional
$5,390 a year. In science, the extra charge is $7,368.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In its 85 years, the Carnegie Hero Fund
Commission has rewarded about 7,300 men, women and children for
heroism, out of 63,000 who were nominated. What makes a hero? The
commission has its criteria, but most of the recipients of the
award are hard pressed to explain what prompted their actions.

   When petite Gail Mazzetti Hooks spotted two
thugs beating a Houston police officer and going for his gun, she
attacked with uncharacteristic fury _ scratching, kicking and
punching _ until the two men fled.
   ``I thought they were going to kill him,'' recalls Hooks, a
waitress who had been watching the events from inside a restaurant.
``He had the prettiest face, but he was purple. I kept thinking,
`That could be my brother.'''
   Hooks ran after one of the bad guys until reality caught up with
heroism on that warm, humid evening of April 20, 1986. In a back
alley, alone and shaking, she abandoned the chase, threw up in the
bushes, and hurried home to bed.
   Nevertheless, the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission proclaimed her a
hero, and a forever-grateful officer James Whitley sent flowers.
   Hooks is one of 7,313 men, women and children who have been
honored by the commission since its founding in 1904 by
industrialist Andrew Carnegie, who was moved by the bravery
displayed following a mine explosion near Pittsburgh.
   Carnegie heroes receive $2,500 and a bronze medal on which is
inscribed the New Testament verse: ``Greater love hath no man than
this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''
   For the self-effacing Hooks, who moved out of Texas shortly
after the fracas because one of the attackers remained at large,
the term ``hero'' is one she is uncomfortable with.
   ``That was the way I was brought up,'' said Hooks, now 31 and
living in Charlotte, N.C. ``If you saw someone who needed help, you
just helped them. You don't think about it, you just do it.''
   To Whitley, however, Hooks and another waitress who came to his
rescue deserve the title.
   ``I couldn't believe they tried to help me like that when they
could have easily gotten killed or hurt,'' recalls Whitley, 28, who
is still on the Houston police force.
   ``I probably wouldn't be here today if not for them.''
   In establishing the fund, which he endowed with $5 million,
Carnegie said he wasn't trying to ``create heroism...knowing well
that heroic action is impulsive.''
   He also said he wanted to make sure heroes or their survivors
don't ``suffer pecuniarily'' as a result of their deeds.
   Paying for pensions, scholarship money and funeral expenses ``is
where Carnegie has its real punch,'' says commission spokesman
Walter Rutkowski.
   In 85 years, more than 63,000 people have been nominated for
heroism awards. Only 7,313, or about 11 percent, were chosen to
receive them.
   ``We are up to our whatever in nominees,'' says Rutkowski, whose
office in downtown Pittsburgh is watched over by a somber portrait
of Carnegie. ``We give away as many awards as we have cases that
meet our requirements.''
   Nominees are scrutinized by three investigators before they are
voted on by the commission's 21-member executive committee.
   Like ``Dragnet's'' Joe Friday, investigators want to know ``just
the facts.''
   `In a drowning case, we go for the water temperature, the
distance of the swim, the current and the rescuer's swimming
ability,'' Rutkowski says. ``We don't get into a person's psyche.
   ``You can not get emotionally tied up with these cases. You just
don't have the capacity to see these cases other than clinically.
It's like a doctor in the operating room. You don't want him to
weep over the pain you're in.''
   Candidates are excluded from consideration if they are obligated
to act because of their occupation, such as lifeguard or
firefighter. A person who saves a family member also is excluded,
unless the rescuer is severely injured or killed.
   Above all, the victim must be in imminent danger of losing his
life, and the hero must risk his life in performing the rescue,
which must take place in the United States or Canada.
   More than 1,500 Carnegie heroes, or roughly 21 percent, died
performing their rescues, the most common of which involve
drownings or fires.

   Surprisingly, perhaps, a candidate isn't excluded if he fails to
save a person's life.
   ``It may sound crass, but we're not interested in the victim so
much as the rescuer,'' Rutkowski says. ``We're not a lifesaving
award. We give awards to those who risk their own lives to save
others.''
   Heroes range in age from 8 to 80, and 91 percent are male.
   Most are modest and hard pressed to explain what prompted their
actions, the investigators say.
   ``I don't think anyone can truthfully claim to understand why
anyone stands by or gets involved,'' says Marlin Ross, a Carnegie
investigator since 1983.
   Carnegie hero Robert Jameson says the act of heroism is
instinctual.
   ``If you don't react immediately, you're going to be overwhelmed
by what happens. You'll just freeze,'' says Jameson, 36, of
Roebling, N.J., who last April saved a woman from a knife-wielding
attacker.
   ``It has nothing to do with bravery,'' says Andrew Mathieson,
60, of Pittsburgh, who was shot three times while defending his
secretary, Jane Celender, from a gunman on Feb. 19, 1986.
   ``If you ask if I would attack a 210-pound man holding a gun, I
would say, `No, not consciously.' But if the circumstances would
develop the same way again, I would probably do the same thing,''
he says. ``I think the real brave people are those who have time to
consider what they're going to do and still do it.''
   Mary Ann Anderson, whose father, John, died trying to save a boy
from drowning in Lake Michigan on July 17, 1987, says she's met
several Carnegie heroes, and all share one trait.
   ``They all have this fundamental concern for people, that what
you do in life does matter and affect others,'' says Miss Anderson,
24, of Baldwin, Mich.
   ``Everyone wants to believe the best of them will come out. But
no one knows what you are going to do in a situation like that. You
either panic or you do something. It's your inner soul taking
over.''
   Anderson's death left not only an emotional void in his family's
life but also a financial one. His three children were in college
at the time, and there was little money to pay the bills.
   The Carnegie commission stepped in, paying the funeral expenses,
setting up a monthly stipend for Anderson's wife, Louise, and
contributing scholarship money.
   ``It was a blessing,'' said Mrs. Anderson, 42, a schoolteacher
in Baldwin. ``There were many bleak times when I didn't know if I
was going to be able to make the bills.''
   Of the 105 beneficiaries currently receiving pensions, Evelyn
Sponsler of Everett, Pa., has been on the books the longest.
   For 58 years, Mrs. Sponsler and her disabled daughter have lived
exclusively on a Carnegie pension, awarded when her husband,
Clarence, died trying to rescue a man who was overcome by fumes
when he fell into a gasoline storage tank.
   ``I probably would have had to live on welfare without it,''
says Mrs. Sponsler, 82, who had three young children to raise when
her husband died.
   Last year, the commission gave out $236,000 in pensions. About
$372,000 went toward the $2,500 hero awards, funeral expenses and
to 20 scholarship recipients.
   What heroes often do not receive is praise from the person whose
lives they've saved, say commission investigators.
   Jameson says the woman he saved never thanked him, but he can
understand why.
   ``This was a very violent thing that happened to her,'' he says.
``She just wants to put it in her past and forget about it.''
   Jane Celender, 42, the Pittsburgh secretary who owes her life to
Mathieson's quick actions, says thanks seem inadequate.
   ``How can you say thank you for your life?'' she asks.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They were called the Aces, a group of full-time
bridge players recruited by a Texas businessman who wanted America
to be the best. That was 20 years ago and nobody then could have
guessed what a lasting influence they would have on the game.

<TEXT>
   America's top names in bridge credit their success
at cards to a wealthy Texan's ``play for pay'' offer two decades
ago.
   Dallas businessman Ira Corn, himself a bridge player, got tired
of Italy dominating the world bridge championships. So, in 1968, he
dealt himself a winning hand.
   Corn recruited a handful of players _ Bobby Wolff, Jim Jacoby,
Mike Lawrence, Bobby Goldman and Billy Eisenberg _ and offered them
modest pay if they would come to Dallas and ``work'' full time at
playing bridge and honing their games.
   ``I joined them a year later,'' says Bob Hamman, now 50 and the
world's No. 1-ranked player. ``We'd play a lot of tournaments. A
computer would deal certain hands so we could practice the type
hands we needed work on.''
   Corn dubbed his recruits the ``Aces.'' They were required to go
through a training regimen as if they were professional athletes.
   ``It was approached in that fashion, as a matter of fact, like
an athletic team,'' Hamman says. ``The pay wasn't great. I believe
single guys got $800 a month and the married guys got $1,000. But
it wasn't bad at all.
   `It was great experience, all against top-echelon players. I
thought it was terrific, getting paid to do something I liked so
well.''
   A secretary recorded every play they made in their practice
sessions, and the spotlight was beamed on good plays and bad alike.
   In 1970, the Aces brought the United States its first world
bridge championship since 1959. They repeated in 1971.
   ``In very short order, in respect to American competition, we
became professionals against amateurs,'' Hamman says.
   Then, in 1971, the Aces broke up, ``and it was back to the
pack,'' Hamman says.
   But Corn's project had a lasting influence on the quality of
U.S. bridge.
   ``That's evident if you look at the record of the players on the
team since it broke up,'' Hamman says. ``Every player became a
rock-solid player and became tougher mentally.''
   Since the formation of the Aces in 1968, the United States sent
a team to the world championship only once without at least one
member of the Aces on it.
   Jacoby says the standard of bridge also was improved by a wealth
of literature about the game, much of it written by Aces members or
influenced by their innovations.
   Jacoby, who is a stock broker in Dallas, and Wolff write
syndicated bridge columns that appear daily in newspapers
throughout the United States. Wolff and Hamman tried unsuccessfully
to market a computer software program that bridge players could use
to improve their play. They couldn't come up with anything that
could meet their standards.
   Lawrence, who now lives in Berkeley, Calif., was recognized as
the bridge author of the '70s and '80s, and a recent survey listed
him as the No. 1 bridge author today. He has written 12 books on
various aspects of bidding, play and defense.
   Lawrence also is regarded as one of the foremost instructors,
traveling across the country to hold weeklong seminars for classes
of 25 or more bridge players.
   ``I certainly would be the first to credit Ira Corn for the fact
that I am a bridge author at all, or that I ever began teaching
classes,'' Lawrence says.
   In 1969, after Lawrence had been with the Aces for a year, Corn
told them he was contemplating writing a bridge column and asked
each of them to write five practice bridge columns. He liked
Lawrence's easy, conversational style of writing and called him in.

   ``He told me I wrote very well but that instead of a column, he
wanted me to write a book,'' Lawrence says. ``A month later, he
said, `Michael, you are going to give a series of bridge classes in
five weeks _ here are the students who will be in your class, and
this is where you are to go.' I was literally terrified, but he
made me do it.''
   From the first book and the first classes came other books and
other classes.
   Last October, Lawrence began a monthly newsletter _ the first
major venture of its kind in bridge.
   ``I am attempting to combine about 80 percent judgment with 20
percent system,'' Lawrence says. ``Hopefully I will find the right
combination.''
   When the Aces were formed, ``there were probably no more than 20
bridge books of acceptable tournament standard,'' Lawrence says.
``Now, there are probably 500.''
   The American Contract Bridge League _ the governing body for
tournament bridge play _ has made a major push to bring new players
into the game, as evidenced by a growing number of tournament
events in which novices may play only against other novices.
   The game is still dominated at the higher levels by the big
names of a decade ago. Few new impact bridge professionals have
emerged.
   ``Bridge players are getting better, without doubt, but the same
plyers are still the dominant players,'' Lawrence says. ``I'm not
really sure why that is.''
   Some believe it's because there's little financial reward in
bridge, such as awaits those who excel in some other competitions.
   Hamman and Wolff, both of whom still live in Dallas, are ranked
individually as the No. 1 and 2 players in the world and together
are regarded as the top partnership in the world.
   They were part of teams that won four world bridge championships
over the past 10 years.
   In October, they teamed with Jacoby, Jeff Meckstroth, Eric
Rodwell and Seymon Deutsch to emerge No. 1 from a field of more
than 50 teams in Venice to give the United States the only world
championship that had eluded it _ the World Men's Team Olympiad.
   Deutsch, a Laredo, Texas, businessman and the only member of the
six-man U.S. team who never before had won a world championship,
was ecstatic.
   ``It's fantastic, it's unreal,'' he says. ``It's the thrill of a
lifetime.''
   Some bridge professionals are on the tournament trail virtually
every week of the year. But unlike sports such as tennis and golf,
80 percent to 90 percent of the tournament field is made up of
ordinary bridge players of varying levels of expertise.
   A trophy is awarded to the player who wins the most matchpoints
each year. Neither Hamman nor Wolff has ever come close to winning
it.
   ``If you go after it, it pretty well is a full-time venture,''
Hamman says. ``I play a lot of tournaments, but not 40 a year,
which is pretty well what you'd have to play. It gets to be quite a
grind, going to Boise, Idaho, one week, and then to Butte, Mont.,
and then to Chicago.''
   Still, Hamman concedes that if thousands of dollars in prize
money were at stake, ``that would be different.'' He would be in
the hunt.
   Some financial reward is available. At every tournament, some
players pay professionals $400 to $500 a day to be their partners
for various two-session events _ about seven hours of play.
   For the first time in years, Jacoby traveled the tournament
circuit last year. Playing sometimes with other pros and sometimes
with paying clients, he emerged as an easy victor in the 1988
matchpoint chase.
   Jacoby says he made a determined run for the title because his
father, the late Oswald Jacoby, won the title years ago. The
Jacobys are the only father-son combination to have won the trophy.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The infamous Long Island garbage barge and the
Philadelphia freighter filled with ash drew attention to the
nation's growing trash problem as they sailed the seas in vain
looking for a place to dump their unwanted cargo. But small town
America is also feeling the pinch as landfills continue to fill up.
Here's what has happened in one New York town where a special
police detail is on guard against illegal dumping.

<TEXT>
   Sanitation workers tore into a plastic
garbage bag, searching for clues. The giveaway could have been a
receipt, a letter.
   In the end, an unopened envelope from a mail-order publishing
contest was the telltale evidence needed to trace the smelly bag
back to its source.
   A police officer who follows the local garbage truck as part of
the new garbage detail tracked down the culprit _ one of the many
people since January who've had to be told they were mishandling
their garbage. About 20 have been actually arrested and fined for
violating city codes on trash disposal.
   Garbage _ and how to throw it away _ has taken on a whole new
meaning for the 7,900 residents of this city since the county
landfill was closed last fall for pollution violations.
   People in Columbia County don't simply drag the weekly trash to
the curb anymore. Garbage disposal takes thought and time and money.
   City residents must place $2 stickers on their garbage bags or
else it won't be picked up. That's because the county has to come
up with an estimated $6 million to handle the costs of shipping its
trash elsewhere.
   Hudson residents who consistently refuse to use the stickers can
be assessed a $15 service charge, plus a $5 charge per bag, which
is placed on their quarterly city water and sewer bills.
   But even the sticker system isn't foolproof.
   When the program began in December, there were some complaints
of sticker stealing. Then, the stickers didn't stick well in cold
weather and more than one resident has been seen chasing after an
airborne sticker on a cold and windy day. Now the county is
considering giving up the stickers and selling garbage bags instead.
   ``It's difficult. It really is,'' says Paulette Riegel, standing
behind the counter of her furniture and craft store. ``You never
knew garbage was worth so much.''
   ``My animals love it, because they are getting more scraps from
the table than ever,'' adds Riegel, who seems to be taking the new
regulations in stride. At least one customer had already ordered a
special wooden garbage bin with different sections for recycling,
which soon will become mandatory countywide.
   Down the main street, another store owner said she called the
county to ask how to best dispose of hundreds of cardboard boxes
from shipments to her store. Because cardboard recycling hadn't yet
been implemented, she was told to cut the boxes up into little
pieces, place them in garbage bags and put them at the curb _ WITH
the mandatory sticker on the bag.
   The boxes remained at the store until she gave them to a
community group.
   Other people haven't been that conscientious.
   Some folks just wouldn't adhere to the new rules at first,
prompting the special police garbage enforcement team.
   ``People who reside outside the city were bringing their garbage
into the city and dumping it in the alleys,'' says Police Chief
James Dolan Jr. On the up side, he says, compliance is improving.
   Reaction from residents has been ``a very mixed bag,'' says
County Board of Supervisors Chairman Francis Blake.
   Liquor store owner Julie Goldweitz says the recycling and
sticker program is ``a pain in the neck, but other than that it
makes perfect sense to me. We're doing what we should have been
doing for years. If that's the real cost of us living here on this
planet, then we have to pay for it.''
   The rest of New York State _ and the nation _ might do well to
learn from the misfortune of Columbia County, if they aren't
already in the throes of garbage disposal problems, government and
industry officials say.
   ``It is not unusual in these times for counties or
municipalities _ in the East especially _ to find themselves with
no disposal alternative,'' says Joe Salimondo, editor of Waste Age
magazine in Washington, D.C.
   Some big cities have already run out of landfill space and now
export their garbage at a very high cost, he says.
   The infamous Long Island garbage barge, which spent eight weeks
at sea in 1987 and was rejected by several states and three
countries, was a prime example of garbage with no place to go.
   Philadelphia had a similar experience with a freighter that was
laden with 14,000 tons of ash that sailed the seas for two years.
It was rejected by at least 11 countries and eventually turned up
empty in Singapore after changing names and owners.
   ``The worst situation for waste disposal is in the northeastern
part of the United States because of the population density and the
lack of availability of disposal sites,'' says Ross Patten, vice
president of Browning-Ferris Industries, a national waste disposal
company based in Houston. ``Other parts of the country are not as
acutely affected, other than California.''
   ``Columbia County should serve as a warning to a lot of other
communities who haven't taken affirmative action toward resolving
their solid waste problems,'' says R.W. Groneman, a spokesman for
the state Department of Environmental Conservation.
   In New York, where 20 million tons of garbage are produced
annually, the state has implemented tough new standards on
landfills and has a set a goal of reducing or recycling 50 percent
of the waste stream by the mid-1990s.
   A number of New York communities are building new landfills,
composting leaves, implementing recycling and requiring use of
special garbage bags to raise revenue for increased garbage
disposal costs.
   Unfortunately, Columbia County's problem was a political
football and nothing was done until the issue reached crisis
proportions.
   ``The landfills that we as a nation have built over the years
are filling up,'' Salimondo says. ``But the public reaction to
landfills _ thanks to the whole earth movement of the last 18 years
_ have made people aware that they don't want a landfill in their
back yard.''

   Tom Bosley, who stars in NBC's ``Father
Dowling Mysteries,'' probably looks more comfortable in a clerical
collar than any actor since Pat O'Brien, even if his St.
Christopher's medal does have a Star of David on one side.
   The suggestion prompts a slight smile and an arching of his
thick eyebrows. ``Pat O'Brien played my uncle on `Happy Days,''' he
says.
   The smile becomes a laugh as Bosley expands on his own ethic
background.
   ``My great-grandfather was chief Orthodox rabbi of Chicago,'' he
says. ``But I lived near a Catholic church and had a friend who
sang in the choir. I was a boy soprano, and even though I was
Jewish I'd go over and rehearse and sometimes sing with the choir.
   ``My wife is Catholic. She corrects me if I do something wrong
as Father Dowling. When we did the pilot she gave me a medal with
St. Christopher on one side and the Star of David on the other.''
   Bosley stars as a crime-solving Chicago priest in the NBC
series, adapted from the novels by Ralph McInerny. The one-hour
series has just completed its spring tryout. It gave NBC its best
ratings in three years during its Friday night time period.
   ``Father Dowling Mysteries'' is expected to return in the fall,
although the final decision depends on how well other tryout series
do.
   The show also stars Tracy Nelson as Sister Steve, a former
street kid who is his savvy contact with more worldly sources, and
Mary Wickes as Marie, the rectory housekeeper.
   Bosley was contacted about the role while he was still playing
Sheriff Amos Tupper on CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   Producers Fred Silverman and Dean Hargrove originally considered
the older ``Father Brown'' book series, but those stories turned
out to be too sophisticated to adapt for television.
   ``They contacted me five years ago, during the first year of
`Murder, She Wrote,''' Bosley says. ``Fred had this idea for me and
gave me a volume of `Father Brown' to read on location in Mendocino
and during a later vacation in Europe. I must say the idea for
Tracy Nelson was my idea. I felt we needed someone to give the show
a youthful balance.
   ``At the same time, she's his guide to the street world just as
he's hers for the world inside the church. Someday we hope to do a
back story of how she came into the sisterhood.''
   Bosley got his first chance to test the waters as a priest in a
``Perry Mason'' movie in May 1986. Michele Greene starred as a nun
who was accused of murdering a young priest she reputedly was
romantically involved with. Bosley played Father DeLeon.
   ``They wrote the part for me after the original script was
finished,'' he says. ``I was the priest who was always reading
Sherlock Holmes. Michele Greene was considered for the part of
Sister Steve, but she'd already done a pilot called `L.A. Law.'''
   Bosley says he adapted a few things about Father Dowling to suit
himself.
   ``He was probably a man who wanted to be a policeman and flunked
the physical,'' he says. ``He always had a penchant for solving
crimes. He incurs the wrath of the bishop quite often. He's naive
to the ways of the world. He doesn't drive. He never has any money
in his pocket. Someone else always has to pay for the cab.
   ``The bishop is always after him because his church is behind on
donations. He has to ask people for money and gets it in ways that
are unusual. He'll talk to someone about a crime and they'll want
to give him a donation. They haven't got time for him.''
   The two-hour pilot was filmed in Chicago, but the series
episodes were made in Denver. Silverman and Hargrove also film
``Perry Mason'' there. As a result, Bosley and Debbie Reynolds,
guest star in a recent ``Perry Mason'' movie, had a reunion.
   ``We kept passing each other in the lobby of the hotel where we
were staying,'' he says. Bosley played her brother in ``The Debbie
Reynolds Show'' in 1969-70.
   ``That show came on eight weeks before the end of cigarette
advertising. Her public relations man sent a telegram saying she
wouldn't work because the show had a cigarette sponsor. That killed
the show.
   ``The thing I remember most is that my dear mother, who was then
in her late 70s and living in Chicago, saw a headline that said,
`Debbie's Show Goes Up in Smoke.' She was at a stage where she only
read headlines. She called and asked if anyone was hurt in the
fire.''
   ``Father Dowling'' is the ninth series for Bosley, who also won
a Tony for his title role in ``Fiorello!'' in 1959. He remained
active on the New York stage until the mid-1960s, when he became a
part of the repertory company for NBC's ``That Was the Week That
Was.''
   Next came ``The Debbie Reynolds Show,'' followed by ``The Dean
Martin Show,'' ``The Sandy Duncan Show, ``Wait Till Your Father
Comes Home'' (He was the voice of the father on this cartoon show),
``Happy Days,'' ``That's Hollywood'' (as narrator) and ``Murder,
She Wrote.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steve Ross performs the music of Cole Porter and
Noel Coward with a wit, style and sophistication that those two
masters of song would appreciate.
   Most nights you'll find him behind the piano at L'Omnibus de
Maxim's, the Madison Avenue watering hole modeled after its famous
Paris namesake.
   Maxim's, with its elegant charm, is the perfect setting for
someone who plays and sings the songs of not only Porter and Coward
but other musical geniuses such as Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart,
Arlen, Kern and Sondheim, too.
   With his slick-backed hair and impeccable tailoring, Ross evokes
another era, a time when men dressed for dinner, wore tuxedos to
opening night at the opera, drank martinis instead of mineral water
and had seen every hit Broadway musical at least twice.
   Ross has been a part of the New York cabaret scene since the
late '60s when he arrived from Washington, D.C. But his love of
music, particularly popular music, started much earlier. As a
child, Ross remembers listening to Beatrice Kay who sang songs of
the Gay '90s, old-fashioned ditties like ``Heaven Will Protect the
Working Girl'' and ``She's Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage.''
   ``They were real numbers,'' Ross recalls. ``The seeds were being
planted even back then for that kind of vaudeville performing. The
cabaret stuff that performers do now is really an outgrowth of what
vaudeville was. There's the idea of building a number or getting to
an ending.''
   It was one of those types of numbers _ ``Don't Go in the Lion's
Cage Tonight'' _ which became the first song Ross sang in public,
warbling in what he calls his ``cracked baritone voice.''
   ``Roberta Flack was a big influence,'' he recalls. ``At the
time, she was a piano and singing teacher and worked a little club
on Capitol Hill.
   ``I would go there for brunch, get mildly high on Bloody Marys
and she would come on and break our hearts,'' he recalls. ``Every
once in a while, she would invite me up to sing and I would do
`Don't Go in the Lion's Cage Tonight.'''
   Before the rock era took over, Ross dabbled in classical music
and played in little dance bands in the Washington area. But then
Manhattan beckoned, and Ross didn't say no to jobs in small clubs
in New York and teaching voice to students. It wasn't easy.
   ``I didn't start out at the Ritz,'' he says. ``I've worked in
some places that are now video stores.''
   At first, he didn't sing. But when he discovered nightspots were
more eager to hire a singer than just a piano player, he would.
   ``I started singing funny little songs, patter songs,'' he says.
``So I started taking lessons and still do, to keep me on the
straight and narrow.''
   Even then, he was carefully cultivating his image as urban
sophisticate.
   ``I always wore my little tie and I always sang Cole Porter
songs,'' Ross says. ``People said, `Keep doing that.' And
fortunately that kind of music came around again. I didn't know
anything else. I kept doing the songs that I liked to do.''
   Audiences really began discovering Ross in the late 1970s when
he played a now-disappeared club and restaurant called Ted Hook's
Backstage, located just west of Eighth Avenue in the theater
district.
   Over his piano there was built a big false piano around which
customers could sit. Diners in the large restaurant could also hear
him.
   ``While the club was there, it was really a wonderful amalgam,''
Ross says. ``People came to look, people came to be looked at.
Stagehands and stars.''
   Alice Faye would get up and sing or Liza Minnelli would join
Ross in a duet.
   Audiences also discovered Ross' passion for obscure good songs.
An enthusiastic sheet music collector, he searches everywhere for
new old material and has resurrected many an unknown Porter or
Coward rarity. The title of his new album, ``Most of Every Day,''
is a rare Coward song. Now people bring him songs, new and old.
   How does Ross pick the songs he sings?
   ``The words have to work first,'' he says. ``When it's just me
and the piano, I want to have good words. I can't make it on a high
note. I'm not Pavarotti. So the words have to be important.''
   In 1981, Ross became the first performer in 40 years to play the
Algonquin Hotel's famed Oak Room. He stayed for four years. Since
then, he hasn't given his passport a rest. London. Venice. Hong
Kong. Australia. Even Kenya, where he wowed them in Nairobi. Now
he's ready to hang his hat in New York for a while. It's the city
that suits him best. Its possibilities are endless.
   ``The essence of romance is possibility,'' Ross says. ``That's
why New York is such a romantic place. Anything can happen: you
cross the street, something comes to town, you go into a place.
That's why I can't leave this city. Anything can happen here.''

<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic    EDITOR'S NOTE _ A saying of Brazilian
cynics has it that Brazil is a country of the future and always will be.
After four years of civilian government, Brazilians wonder if the cynics
are right. This is another in a series of periodic reports by The Associated
Press on the economic, social and political turbulence that has turned
South America into a continent in crisis.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just a little over four years ago,
on March 15, 1985, thousands of Brazilians, waving
green-yellow-and-blue national flags, rushed up the main ramp of
the presidential palace in Brasilia and cheered their nascent ``New
Republic.''
   The right-wing generals who had ruled for 21 years had stepped
aside and hopes ran high: Brazil under civilian direction would
bound forward toward the prosperous future so many had envisioned.
   It hasn't happened.
   And some Brazilians, often out of frustration, say it was better
when the generals ran things.
   Today, under the centrist civilian presidency of Jose Sarney,
the 200 percent annual inflation left by the generals has soared to
more than 1,000 percent; the cruzado currency has been devalued by
a factor of 1 million.
   Public officials, who were supposed to show how a responsible
democracy could work in South America, are involved in seemingly
non-ending scandals of payoffs, kickbacks, nepotism and misuse of
government funds.
   Public services are deteriorating. Big cities are grimier than
ever. Street crime is rising. Strikes, often accompanied by
violence, disrupt daily life in one form or another.
   Brazilians with money and skills seek visas for Portugal, Italy,
Australia and Canada or, as a last resort, to get into the United
States and stay there illegally.
   Brazil is smothered by the biggest foreign debt in the Third
World: $115 billion.
   ``It's only a matter of time before the armed forces will have
to come back in,'' a Brazilian executive said recently on a luxury
yacht sailing past Sugar Loaf Mountain.
   A taxi driver tells a passenger that all he has made for his
long day negotiating Rio de Janeiro's traffic is 15 cruzados _ $15
at the official rate but in reality worth only $8.10.
   ``Why don't the generals just take over this ... ,'' he snarls.
   Still, he's better off than most: only 35 percent of Brazilians
make more than the minimum wage, which is the equivalent of $64 a
month.
   Indications are the taxi driver is not likely to get his wish.
The armed forces have shown no inclination to get involved again in
politics. Military chiefs say, repeatedly, they will support the
winner of the presidential election Nov. 15 no matter who it is.
   And while some of the talk seems to favor a military return,
Brazilians in general, when it comes down to it, hope it doesn't
happen. The dictatorships of 1930-1945 and 1964-1985 are still
clearly remembered _ censorship, secret arrests, even torture.
   In 1985, The New Republic broadcast a slogan for government
action: ``Everything for Social Progress.''
   But a study this year, led by the sociologist Helio Jaguaribe
and titled ``Brazil _ Reform or Chaos,'' concluded: ``In no other
country in the world, not even India, are social contrasts so
shocking.''
   The research indicated that 41 percent of all Brazilians ``live
in a state of misery or strict poverty.''
   Along Rio's stylish Ipanema Beach, abandoned children in raggedy
shorts sleep on the sidewalk outside $1-million, ocean-view condos
with garages protecting $75,000 Mercedes sports cars.
   The amount of Brazil's total wealth held by the richest 1
percent of the population, about 13 percent, equals that of the
poorest 50 percent.
   More than half of Brazil's tillable farmland is in the hands of
2 percent of the country's farmers.
   Although Brazil has renowned universities and graduate programs,
just 9 percent of school-age children make it through eighth grade.
   ``The fundamental characteristic of Brazilian society is its
profound duality,'' the Jaguaribe study said. ``On one side there
is a modern industrial society. On the other is a primitive
society, living at a subsistence level.''
   Jair Meneguelli is president of the militant Central Workers
Union, which organized a partly successful two-day national protest
strike in March.
   ``Brazil's current crisis stems from a long history of
corruption and a total lack of proper government priorities such as
housing, health and education,'' he said.
   ``If Brazil does not change, the future will be one of social
convulsion.''

   What Brazil needs, Meneguelli said, is the victory of a leftist
reformer, such as Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, in November's
presidential balloting.
   ``What Brazil needs is time,'' said Sarney, a 58-year-old
politician, lawyer and poet.
   He added in an interview with The Associated Press: ``We have
consolidated democratic institutions. Political groups formerly
considered extremist now are playing politics by democratic rules.
We have not had any military uprisings or serious social
upheavals.''
   One large problem is official graft. Charges of official
corruption appear almost daily in the press; officials, including a
Cabinet minister routinely referred to as ``Robber,'' scarcely
bother to refute them.
   Newsphotos purport to show official cars taking functionaries'
children to expensive private schools and their maids to the
supermarket.
   Also underlying Brazil's ills is the enormous foreign debt.
   Sarney said that if creditors _ the main ones are big U.S. banks
_ simply do not write off part of what is owed, ``democracy will be
threatened, and Marxist alternatives will start looking attractive
to the people.''
   Most of the money was borrowed by the military government
without objection from a rubberstamp Congress, but it did help
Brazil build some things necessary for progress: airports and
highways, a modern telephone system, a 10-mile bridge across
Guanabara Bay from Rio to Niteroi, and the Itaipu Dam, the world's
largest hydroelectric generator.
   But a lot more money was wasted on projects that never panned
out.
   The borrowed money also created a veritable army of big-spending
``technocrats'' who in turn proliferated bureaucracies generally
unaccountable to public scrutiny.
   The ordinarily pro-government newspaper O Globo of Rio
complained recently of ``gigantic gangs of lazy bureaucrats whose
salaries and free spending affront millions of fellow citizens who,
because of ignorance, must wait in lines of want and misery.''
   President Sarney noted in the interview with The AP in Brasilia
that Brazil in the last four years has paid $50 billion in debt
interest alone, ``money that would have allowed the implanatation
of a gigantic program of national development.''
   Shortly after taking office in 1985, Sarney announced a sweeping
program called ``Brazil 2000'' to improve living standards and
reduce social inequality. Little or nothing has come of it.
   Sarney says Brazil does not want confrontation with the foreign
banks and governments and international organizations it owes money
to.
   But Brazil's next president might not be so moderate.
   Lula Da Silva, a former strike organizer and leader of the
Marxist-inspired Workers Party, goes along with the view of
President Fidel Castro of Cuba: Brazil shouldn't pay any more.
   Leonel Brizola, a populist, leftist firebrand of the 1960s who
now calls himself a European-style socialist, says that while
Brazil shouldn't become an outright ``deadbeat,'' the debt in its
present form cannot be paid.
   A private poll done in March and widely regarded as accurate
indicated that Brizola and da Silva are the front-runners at this
point in the presidential race, although the campaign is not
officially under way.
   Finance Minister Mailson da Nobrega told a group of foreign
correspondents recently that if foreign creditors don't reduce the
debt, Brazilians and other Latin Americans will turn to ``radicals
and demagogues'' for future leadership.
   But Brazilians are fond of saying ``God is Brazilian,'' and not
everyone is pessimistic.
   ``Brazil is further along the road to the upside scenario than
many think,'' said Christopher R. Lund of the American Chamber of
Commerce in Sao Paulo, the nation's financial center.
   Brazil is discovering more oil and gold, and some voices now are
being raised in favor of conserving, rather than destroying, the
huge Amazon rain forest.
   And there still are Brazilians who believe their country can
``make it'' through old-fashioned hard work.
   ``Brazil's crisis has little to do with the political transition
and much less with the foreign debt,'' said Sen. Roberto Campos of
the right-wing Social Democratic Party, who under the military
regime was planning minister and ambassador to the United States.
   Campos' solution?
   Deregulation, more aggressive free enterprise, unrestricted
trade, international market integration, no more talk of Marxism
and labor militancy and ``an end to obsolete thinking and the lack
of ideas for stimulating development.''

   A middle-class, middle-aged woman
with no political experience is shaking up Rio de Janeiro with a
rare and risky campaign to clean up corruption in the City Council.
   Regina Gordilho, elected to public office for the first time in
November, says she has received death threats almost every day
since her ``moralization campaign'' got under way.
   Mrs. Gordilho, 54, was a small businesswoman until two years
ago, when her son was beaten to death by five state policemen.
After a judge freed them all, she ran for the City Council and won.
   Her Democratic Labor Party, which won the most seats, chose her
to be the Council's president.
   When she took office in January she found that about 3,000
public employees worked for the Council, which had just 42 members.
Many of them were friends and relatives of officeholders, earning
salaries of up to $600 a month in contrast to the national minimum
wage of $64 a month and the average monthly wage in Rio de Janeiro
of about $90.
   It as a time, too, that the city government had imposed
belt-tightening measures and cut service cuts to save Rio de
Janeiro from bankruptcy. Rio's streets were full of potholes,
garbage often sat uncollected and hospitals and schools frequently
were shut down.
   Mrs. Gordilho focused on the 3,000 employees.
   She discovered that many of them had been hired illegally and,
though cashing paychecks every month, never came to work.
   ``There's no need for more than 500 functionaries at the
Council,'' she said in an interview. ``But councilmen are using the
administrative section to benefit themselves, their friends, and
their families.''
   Mrs. Gordilho investigated hiring practices and discovered
forged personnel documents. She demanded that all employees
reregister to receive their paychecks.
   As a result, 398 employees hired with falsified documents were
fired. About 500 others who failed to reregister were dropped from
the payroll. Five ex-councilmen and three currently in office were
arraigned on criminal charges, with three of the eight being from
Mrs. Gordilho's own party.
   ``We had 14- and 15-year-old kids _ relatives of councilmen _
hired as advisers,'' she said.
   She said one councilman alone was responsible for 93 fraudulent
hirings.
   ``The irregularities are so widespread, it will take some time
to discover them all,'' she said. ``But the certainty of impunity
is gone forever.''
   Mrs. Gordilho said it never entered her mind to become a
political crusader until March 17, 1987, the day her son
23-year-old son Marcellus was beaten to death by the state troopers.
   He was surfing with several friends in a poor section of the
city when a misunderstanding arose with a trooper who claimed
Marcellus had improper identification. The trooper and four of his
colleagues decided to take Marcellus into the police station for
questioning.
   When the youth struggled to avoid being thrown into the back of
a police van, the officers beat him so severely he suffered two
broken legs and brain damage. By the time Mrs. Gordilho arrived at
the hospital he was dead.
   Mrs. Gordilho crusaded for punishment of the troopers, but
despite six months of legal action and street protests, a judge
exonerated four of the policemen.
   The fifth, the commanding officer, was given a 18-month,
suspended jail sentence, but he was able to keep his job because a
policeman can be dismissed only if sentenced to more than two years
for a crime.
   She maintained that ``impunity for the powerful'' is a leftover
from Brazil's 1964-1985 military government and that ordinary
citizens ``still are struggling to recover their rights.''
   Her attempt to clean up the city government has gained Mrs.
Gordilho widespread backing. She said she has been receiving as
many as 300 letters a from all over Brazil.
   Maria Helena Moreira Alves, a professor of political economy at
the University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, said Mrs. Gordilho's
popularity stems from ``a growing sense of outrage over corruption
at all levels of society.''
   Mrs. Gordilho has her detractors as well, including those who
threaten to kill her in letters and in telephone calls.
   ``The machine gun already has arrived from Paraguay,'' said a
letter she received in March. ``The bullet will be a dum-dum
without salvation.''
   ``These sorts of abuses are common throughout Brazil,'' Mrs.
Gordilho said. ``Somebody's got to try to change that.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Winter People''</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Opens nationally on Friday, April 14.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Some of the most interesting films of 1988 stemmed from novels:
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``The Accidental Tourist,'' ``Little
Dorrit,'' ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' ``The Unbearable
Lightness of Being,'' ``Pelle the Conqueror.''
   While original screenplays remain the most prevalent source of
films, it is heartening to see the comeback of novels.
   Why so? Because from ``The Birth of a Nation'' to ``Gone With
the Wind'' to ``Terms of Endearment,'' novels have lent film
entertainment a substance that is often lacking on a diet of
scripts originated by screenwriters and homogenized by countless
rewrites.
   ``Winter People'' is the latest evidence. Adapted by Carol
Sobieski from John Ehle's novel, the film has faults and excesses.
But it also offers a certain majesty and an accurate sense of time
and place _ the Blue Ridge Mountains in the Depression 1930s.
   Wayland Jackson (Kurt Russell) is a watchmaker who is driving
his motherless daughter (Amelia Burnette) to Philadelphia to start
a new life. When their pickup truck is wrecked in a mountain
stream, they take refuge with a mysterious woman (Kelly McGillis),
who lives in a remote cabin with her fatherless baby boy.
   The mystery unravels. McGillis has been ostracized by her
family, the Wrights, who are the leading citizens of a nearby
village. The father of her child is the unruly son (Jeffrey Meek)
of the lawless Henderson clan, longtime enemies of the Wrights.
   Russell wins the young mother's confidence and love, and the
respect of her family _ after proving his manhood on a bear hunt.
When the father of McGillis' son dies mysteriously, the
long-smoldering feud between the Wrights and the Hendersons erupts
in violence.
   Director Ted Kotcheff manages to keep the complicated plot
running smoothly, though at times the mountain dialect is hard to
comprehend. Kelly McGillis gives understated strength to her role,
and Kurt Russell has his strongest characterization to date, though
the transition from milquetoast to macho man is less than smooth.
   Lloyd Nolan and Mitchell Ryan are powerful as patriarchs of the
two families. As the violent Henderson, Jeffrey Meek is terrifying.
The mountain scenery has been stunningly photographed by Francois
Protat.
   ``Winter People'' was produced by Robert H. Solo for Columbia
Pictures. Scariness and sexual tension give it a PG-13 rating.
Running time: 115 minutes.

   ``Mascara'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $79.95. Rated R)
   
   This film version of bizarre sex and murder in the decadent
opera-going upperclass of Paris is pure Eurotrash from beginning to
end.
   Starring Charlotte Rampling, Michael Sarrazin and Derek De Lint
it limps along, exploiting sexual themes that include normal acts
as well as incest, homosexuality, transsexualism, sado-masochism
and bondage.
   The film wanders through dark alleys, tunnels and rain-washed
streets to the hangout of the weird where one is greeted by a
throaty, half-spoken, heavily accented version of ``Help Me Make It
Through the Night.'' It's supposed to remind us of the decadence of
``Blue Angel'' and Marlene Dietrich's smoky presentations.
   The story tumbles along with uninspired scripting and arty
photography until Rampling pushes brother Sarrazin, a burned-out
police detective and murderer, over the edge so-to-speak after he
declares the only man worthy of her is himself.
   In the final scene, Rampling dissolves into a ``Pieta'' pose,
holding the corpse of her lover (De Lint), who Sarrazin had a mob
of transvestites or transsexuals and what-nots beat almost to death
before they tossed him into the ocean.
   It is one of those pretentious films in which the authors,
directors and actors play at being super-sophisticated. It probably
would make for lofty discussions of allegories and metaphors by
pseudo-intellectuals at a cocktail party, but for entertainment
purposes, it's merely exploitative and boring.

   ``Betrayed'' (MGM-UA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   ``Betrayed,'' which should be a terrifying view of bigotry and
the ease with which it thrives, instead is an implausible and
unsatisfying movie from Costa-Gavras, one of cinema's most esteemed
architects.
   The movie works best as suspense, but intends so much more.
Cathy Weaver (Debra Winger), a right-thinking undercover FBI agent,
tries to infiltrate a white supremacist network the agency believes
responsible for the slaying of a loud, obnoxious, radio talk show
host. Gary (Tom Berenger) is the sweet, down-home widower farmer
she falls for. He also is a top gun in the racist network.
   Although the actors do their best to provide depth, the
characters are not convincing. It makes no sense that liberal Cathy
would fall for Gary, despite his pot roast-making mom and
sweet-as-pie kids. It makes no sense that Gary, after spending
years developing his secret network, would so easily take Cathy
into his every confidence. It makes no sense that Cathy's FBI
supervisors take so little care with her when she finally realizes
her target is the man she loves.
   Still, there are some powerful scenes. In one, Gary's little
girl, in a comforting bedtime chat with Cathy, suddenly spews an
incredible, frightening string of hateful epithets. In another,
Gary takes Cathy and his kids to a white supremacist camp, a place
of cross burnings, gun trading and preparation to take back the
country.

   ``The Truth is Spoken Here'' (RCA-Novus) _ Marcus Roberts
   
   Marcus Roberts, the young pianist who regularly plays in Wynton
Marsalis' band, has released his first album as a leader, and it's
an unabashed tribute to Thelonious Monk.
   Although only one of the eight numbers is a Monk composition,
several of Roberts' own tunes conjure up the quirky style of the
late pianist. Three numbers even feature a longtime Monk sideman,
the late tenor saxophonist Charlie Rouse (he died in December at
age 64, and this was his last recording session).
   Roberts praises Monk's music as ``the reconciliation of
opposites that is so central to the production of great music,''
and added, ``He is certainly one of the role models that I look to
for guidance in my quest for musical understanding.'' Roberts, too,
reconciles opposites _ a maturity that belies his 25 years and the
adolescent whimsy for which Monk was known.
   Marsalis contributed his stylish trumpet to the album. Roberts
let his mentor take off with a breezy muted solo on the opening
number, ``The Arrival,'' heralded by drummer Elvin Jones. The lone
Monk composition, ``Blue Monk,'' was a solo rendering in a stride
piano style that bordered on boogie.
   Roberts' sensitivity came through in a pair of ballads _ the
pianist's own tonally complex ``Maurella'' and the beautiful
``Single Petal of a Rose,'' an Ellington-Strayhorn composition that
conjured up Debussy.
   Ellington's ``In a Mellow Tone,'' the most satisfying tune in
the set, had Rouse playing the straight man while Roberts provided
the humor. A minor blues, ``Country by Choice,'' featured a growing
series of piano choruses with Roberts dodging and weaving around
the pattern like a running back. ``Nothin' But the Blues,'' a basic
12-bar blues pattern with heavy Monkian flavor, was the closer.
   Roberts, blind since he was 4, has made an impressive album
debut. His technical skill, dedication and passion portend
considerable success.

   ``Spike'' (Warner Bros.) _ Elvis Costello
   
   Elvis Costello's sprawling new ``Spike'' is just the kind of
record critics love. It's got voluminous lyrics with a liberal
bent, touches on a wide array of musical styles and has plenty of
guest stars.
   But don't let that scare you.
   ``Spike'' may be a difficult record to grasp, and Costello
sometimes takes himself Too Seriously, but there's plenty of
treasures here for the people with the patience to sift through
them.
   Most fascinating is Costello's new songwriting collaboration
with Paul McCartney. ``Veronica'' is just what you'd hope from such
a partnership: an intelligently written song about an old woman
reliving her life in dreams, married to a breezy arrangement
reminiscent of ``Baby You're a Rich Man.''
   The other MacManus-McCartney song, ``Pads, Paws and Claws,'' is
a rockabilly number that suffers from a cluttered arrangement.
   ``...This Town...,'' a booming rocker highlighted by Roger
McGuinn's guitar and McCartney's bass, lampoons the ``Wall Street''
syndrome of success at all costs. It's one of Costello's most
infectious songs.
   Costello's vitriol is sharp on ``Tramp the Dirt Down,'' where
his fantasy is to dance on Margaret Thatcher's grave. ``God's
Comic,'' about a former vaudeville comedian meeting his maker, is
funny in a warped sort of way.
   ``Baby Plays Around,'' which Costello co-wrote with his wife,
Cait O'Riordan, is delicately beautiful. Its straightforward,
emotional lyrics also highlight Costello's weakness elsewhere _ his
tendency to run off at the mouth.
   His lyrics are easily among the most intelligent in music today,
but he still has trouble simply telling a story. In the funky
``Chewing Gum,'' he can barely spit out the words fast enough. And
the stately melody of ``Satellite'' is marred by lyrics that don't
quite connect. What exactly is he trying to say about love in the
'80s?
   An artist who challenges his listeners, of course, is always
better than someone who panders to them. There's no pandering on
``Spike.'' Costello takes his listeners on a trip through rock,
jazz, funk, Irish music and ballads.
   The ride's not always smooth, but it's never boring.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When director James Ivory and producer Ismail
Merchant first tried to hook up on a film project, they failed.
That was 1962.
   The two have rarely missed since, teaming up with writer Ruth
Prawer Jhabvala for a series of well-crafted adaptations of classic
novels such as Henry James' ``The Bostonians,'' and E.M. Forster's
``A Room With a View.''
   While Merchant and Ivory have specialized in period pieces, they
don't rule out filming a contemporary piece of fiction. When
Jhabvala read the first installment of Tama Janowitz's chronicle of
downtown Manhattan, ``The Slaves of New York,'' she urged the two
to consider the book for their next project.
   ``I've always liked downtown New York,'' Ivory said. ``I
couldn't say I'm a habitue of that particular part of town or that
particular scene Tama wrote about, but I like the look of it. It's
a sort of subculture.''
   The New York of SoHo, with its bohemian art galleries, colorful
inhabitants and lofts, couldn't be further away from the pastoral
beauty of Forster's works, but Ivory was quickly convinced that the
stories in ``The Slaves of New York'' had cinematic potential.
   ``They were funny and nice and interesting,'' he said. ``She's a
very visual writer, the same way that Henry James is or E.M.
Forster. As you read, you could just picture it.''
   Turning books into film is, at best, a risky proposition. The
plot must often be streamlined to conform to the medium, and the
director has a harder time expressing complex thoughts than the
novelist.
   Also, as the makers of ``Portnoy's Complaint'' and ``The Great
Gatsby'' unhappily found out, great novels don't necessarily make
great movies. And ``Slaves of New York'' has generally received
poor reviews.
   ``If it's something that could be called literature, it's up to
you to convey the tone of voice of the writer,'' Ivory said. ``You
may not be all that truthful to the story as they told it; you may
leave things, you may add things. You're giving a cinematic
equivalent to their tone of voice.''
   ``Slaves of New York'' stars Bernadette Peters as Eleanor, a
copyreader at an East Village newspaper who lives with her selfish
and manipulative boyfriend, Stash. Merchant and Ivory agreed that
the Tony Award-winning actress was miles ahead of anyone else they
considered for the lead role.
   ``I feel that she's sort of the reigning Broadway star,'' Ivory
said. ``She's inherited the crown of Mary Martin and Ethel Merman.
To work with someone like that who's more or less at the peak of
her fame is a privilege for a director.''
   Merchant recalled that they had tried to recruit Peters for a
previous film. ``We wanted her to play in `The Wild Party,' but it
didn't work out. We had always admired her and wanted to work with
her. She has a wonderful quality, like Judy Holliday, that
tragi-comic feel.''
   Merchant and Ivory have had their greatest success with the
works of Forster, earning critical praise for ``Maurice'' and
``Room With a View,'' which was nominated for eight Academy Awards
in 1986.
   Both pictures were based in Europe at the turn of the century.
``A Room With a View'' centered on a young heiress' emotional and
physical awakening, while ``Maurice'' dealt with the more
commercially risky subject of two young men's homosexual
relationship.
   ``There were such interesting characters and the story was so
good,'' Merchant said of the latter. ``For people who go through
that, the fears and horrors and all the rest of it involved, that's
never changed at all and it probably never will change.''
   Ivory saw a common thread for the two films. ``Being honest with
yourself. Just to be honest with your feelings and don't deceive
yourself.''
   Merchant and Ivory have worked together for more than 25 years,
an unusually long time in the high-pressure motion picture
industry. Ivory credited the success of the partnership to respect
of each other's opinions.
   ``Nobody tries to ram down the throats of the others something
they don't want to do,'' he said. ``No one goes stamping around
like some dictator over the others. Therefore, we can all do what
we want.''
   The director sees the films as an expression of their
collaboration.
   ``I think they're a reflection of our lives more than
anything,'' he said. ``They reflect our own preoccupations. Our
interests and how our interests have changed. It's a collective
autobiography. It's the line of our lives.''

<HEAD>The Artists: The Zen Conductor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When he was younger, conductor Sergiu
Celibidache was known as an eccentric. Now he's known as a legend,
an artist who seeks truth in music and presents it like no other
conductor, a man who infuses his work with Zen.
   At 76 years old, Celibidache is making his first American tour
with the Munich Philharmonic. He will do 14 concerts this month in
11 cities. The two concerts at Carnegie Hall sold out in March.
   For the last five years, Celibidache has conducted only the
Munich Philharmonic. Rehearsals at Gasteig Hall in Munich, which
are free, are always full. He doesn't allow recordings because he
believes that taping changes the speed and brilliance of the
performance.
   He uses the principals of Zen and phenomenology in his work. The
Zen part is Celibidache and the orchestra rehearsing a lot then his
emptying his mind during the concert and having _ often _ a
transcendent experience. Phenomenology is the study of perceptual
experience in its subjective state.
   ``It is eternal no,'' he said. ``All the nos are eliminated and
we are only yes. The musicians would not call it phenomenology.
They say, `Oh, he knows what he does.'
   ``Phenomenology is the sience of why not so? It is not a causal
why. In the Zen discipline you say, `Is this this?' `Is this this
also?' It is not because this is the result of that. Transcendence
is the phase where thinking is over but we still go on living and
experiencing.
   ``I studied Buddhism. When I was 17 I read about this kind of
ego. I met a Zen monk. I had a master. You come to the point where
Zen will take over.
   ``Emptiness means ... the highest form of concentration. You
have the possibility to step in, every second. The prophets of the
Old Testament practiced that kind of consciousness. If it became
part of the conscious will, it didn't work.''
   When the eighth bar of a piece of music is wrong, Celibidache
said, it is because it didn't follow from the first bar and lead to
the last. ``When I was 42, I had an experience in Venice when I
made music. I saw the connection. It is the beginning and the end,
not one after the other but simultaneously.
   He was conducting three masses in a Venice church with two
choirs that didn't cooperate. Choral sound from balconies arrived
at a different rate than orchestral sound. Saturday rehearsal was
chaos, Celibidache recalled, and he wanted to cancel. ``Sunday
morning I prayed just to finish together.''
   On that Sunday, the church was packed, windows were open for
people outside, people were in aisles and the stairs up to his
podium were removed to make room for more bodies. Celibidache said
he could remember nothing after the performance started.
   ``Normal practice is when something happens wrong in the
orchestra you start trying to remake it and sometimes you succeed
and sometimes not. Nothing of that kind happened. I remember the
final amen, and I came to a kind of normal consciousness again,''
he said.
   ``That was the first experience. I went to conduct Brahms after
Venice. Now I have experienced it I want to have it again. I put my
whole weight behind it and pushed.'' Celibidache discovered what
Zen could have told him, that he could not will a transcendent
experience.
   ``I always am animated by the idea to know the composer's
original ideas,'' he said. And he doesn't conduct with
``discoveries'' or ``own ideas.''
   ``I don't have any `own ideas' at all. My object and my strength
is to find out what was the composer's ideas. What did he mean? I
have not discovered anything.
   ``If you think what I do is an interpretation, you're wrong,''
he said. ``This is the authentic way to play according to what we
could inquire about the way a composer used to play.''
   Celibidache said that too much music is mixed with economics.
``Why not more rehearsals? Because rehearsals do not pay,'' he said.
   ``Who conducts nowadays in Europe? The people whom Deutsche
Grammaphon (Records) recommends. Maybe there are good conductors we
do not know in a small village somewhere. In the big cities, that
is not possible.''
   Celibidache was born in Romania, and went to Germany to study
composition, conducting and musicology in 1936 when he was 24. He
was principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic from the end of
World War II until 1952 when Herbert von Karajan came in.
Celibidache became a guest conductor in Europe and Latin America.
But American orchestras and some European orchestras didn't engage
him because of his rehearsal requirements: He likes to rehearse
when and as often as he likes.
   The Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia invited
Celibidache to train the student orchestra for several months in
1983-84. Celibidache has been in Munich since 1979.
   ``I always avoided the big orchestras, which can follow only one
track, and I avoided living under the pressure of big cities,'' he
said. ``Big symphonies can not afford much rehearsal time and if
they give it they will cry still one year after.
   ``When Munich came to me, I said, `I need very many rehearsals.
I don't accept any pressure. I can not guarantee you a certain
rhythm of production.' They said, `It is all right for us. What
else do you want?' I said, `Nothing.' That is how I land in Munich.
   ``I promised them I'll make the Munich Philharmonic the best
orchestra in the world. I will contend that Munich is nowadays the
best orchestra as far as musical dialectic of the inner parts are
concerned. I don't know any big orchestra which orients itself like
chamber music. This has been not because Celibidache has such great
power. It is because I could find in the musicians an extraordinary
comprehension. The fact that we play Bruckner without facing a
single negative reaction is the confirmation of what I believe in.''

<TEXT>
   Ask John Updike what he remembers most about his
life and you might expect him to talk of his many honors, including
the Pulitzer Prize and the American Book Award.
   Or maybe you'd expect thoughts about his 13 novels, 10 volumes
of short stories and five collections of poetry. Or perhaps proud
tales of his four children.
   But the writer prefers to dwell on simpler events, such as
childhood memories of waiting to hear the footsteps of the mailman,
then lying underneath the chute so the letters could tumble on his
face. Or, the time in junior high school when he stabbed himself in
the palm of his right hand with a lead pencil, leaving a permanent
scar.
   Updike, who insisted in a recent interview that his life
``hasn't had too many things big in it,'' concentrated on seemingly
minor incidents by default.
   ``I managed to avoid all my country's wars,'' the author of
``Rabbit, Run'' and ``The Witches of Eastwick'' said. ``I avoided
many of the problems that inflict people. I never had my house burn
down, never had a major disease. I've been a lucky person. I've
tried to make a story of normal and totally uneventful lives.''
   His most recent work is ``Self-Consciousness'' (Knopf, $18.95),
a collection of six essays that come together like an unofficial
memoir. Updike remembers his childhood in Shillington, Pa., his
lukewarm support for the Vietnam War and his battle with psoriasis
and stuttering.
   He also offers a detailed account of his family tree and
concludes the book with an essay called ``On Being a Self
Forever,'' which sums up his philosophy that even something as
obscure as a signature is a form of expression.
   ``I think the writer who showed me what could be done, and in a
way haunts this book, is (Marcel) Proust _ the way he can so
regularly twirl one of these highly developed details around and go
on to moralize in this quite persuasive and powerful way,'' he said.
   ``Proust is a writer who tried to extract religious meanings out
of random life; he had the notion that nothing is random.''
   Updike was born in 1932 and enjoyed drawing as a child, sending
fan mail to prominent cartoonists begging them for original work.
   ``A surprising number obliged,'' he said. ``I don't know if
Garry Trudeau would send four panels off to an inquiring child. I
got Mickey Finn and Joe Palooka and political cartoons. Receipt of
these things in the mail was a way of making the mail a very
dramatic, crystalized experience for myself.''
   He wrote for the Shillington High School newspaper, and set his
sights on working for the New Yorker magazine, which he joined in
1955. He contributed short stories and light verse, but soon tired
of living in Manhattan. In 1957, he and his first wife, Mary, moved
to Ipswich, a small town outside of Boston.
   His first novel, ``Poorhouse Fair,'' was released in 1959. The
following year Updike came out with ``Rabbit, Run,'' the story of
Harry ``Rabbit'' Angstrom, a 26-year-old husband and father in the
fictional town of Brewer, Pa. Longing for his days as a high school
basketball star, ``Rabbit'' is unable to face the responsibilities
of growing up and runs away.
   ``Rabbit'' would become Updike's faithful alter ego, appearing
again in the sequels ``Rabbit Redux'' and ``Rabbit Is Rich,'' which
earned the writer a Pulitzer, an American Book Award and the
National Book Critics Circle Award in 1981.
   ```Rabbit' is always there for me,'' Updike said. ``He always is
willing to go through the paces I send up for him, and the whole
Pennsylvania milieu is very convenient and very rich. The Rabbit
books are full of the weight of the terrible things that happen.''
   For Updike, writing is a way of relieving pain. In the essay,
``At War With My Skin,'' he vividly describes his attempts to find
a cure for ``that monstrosity,'' psoriasis, a scaly skin disorder.
   In ``Getting the Words Out,'' he attempts to find a reason for
his stuttering, wondering if the impediment is an
``acknowledgement, in conversation, of the framework of
unacknowledged complexity that surrounds the simplest exchange of
words.''
   Updike noted that writing about those afflictions helped ease
their symptoms.
   ``In a way I have a duty, having set up shop as a fiction
writer, to explore the world as fully as I can, including those
corners that I would rather avoid in real life,'' he said.
   ``There's a kind of therapeutic action in the course of writing.
Writing is a way of taming life and putting it into a package. And
once it's packaged, it becomes less overwhelming.''
   He sees writing as consistent with his fondness for the image of
logs going over a waterfall, the feeling of events passing by.
   ``Each day is over the waterfall, there is a kind of bliss in
that. We grow lighter with all these riddances. The `good
riddance,' `Thank God that's over' feeling is one of the happy
feelings I have.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Dolly Parton Returns To Roots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after the failure of her highly
touted network TV show, Dolly Parton has returned to her roots: the
country music she learned growing up in a two-room Smoky Mountain
shack.
   The 43-year-old performer, celebrating her 25th year as an
entertainer, has just released her 50th album, ``White Limozeen.''
   Parton, raised in an east Tennessee hollow where she was the
fourth of 12 children, says the LP is a departure from her pop
music megahit with Kenny Rogers, ``Islands in the Stream.''
   ``It's very country,'' she said in an interview. ``It's a good
album for me to do at this time. It's very true to what I do best.
It captures a lot of the old sound I used to do years and years
ago.''
   It is her second album since ``Trio,'' a Grammy-winning,
million-selling collaboration with two partners of vocal purity:
Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris.
   ``The `Trio' album kind of set up the pace for this one,''
Parton said. ``It's what the public has been wanting me to do for
awhile.''
   Her one-hour ABC variety show, which was not renewed for a
second season, didn't deserve to stay on the air, she said. ``The
show was very confusing. It never found a direction no matter how
hard I tried. It never came together, never jelled because it was
so disjointed.
   ``I wanted the show to be something like `Hee Haw' when it
started. But it was more like hem haw; that's all everybody did _
hem and haw.''
   She recently revived her acting career, joining Sally Field,
Shirley MacLaine and others in the movie ``Steel Magnolias.'' Based
on the Broadway play and due for release in late summer, it's about
a group of Southern women.
   ``It's a fine piece of work, as good as I've done,'' she said.
``We all got along great and made great friends. I like it when
it's that way.''
   It's her first motion picture since ``Rhinestone'' in 1984 with
Sylvester Stallone, a movie savaged by the critics.
   ``It (`Rhinestone') was a hit with me, but I didn't think it was
a great movie,'' Parton recalled. ``It got worse as it went along.
It started out kind of slow and tapered off. Stallone had a lot of
energy and was very funny, but the movie itself was not great.''
   With energy matched by ambition, she made two other movies: ``9
to 5,'' with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, and ``The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas,'' with Burt Reynolds.
   ```9 to 5' was very cute and very good. It was a timely movie
with women's lib going on. It was the best thing I've done.
   ```Whorehouse' was a difficult movie to do,'' she said. ``I
would say it was average. It made a lot of money but didn't get
good reviews. There was a lot of blood on the movie _ ill feelings
from the Broadway show and the original producers. But I loved Burt
and all the people in it.''
   She and Rogers are seen every December in their sentimental
made-for-TV special, ``Kenny and Dolly _ A Christmas to Remember.''
   ``People can see the warmth and love and sincerity in our
friendship,'' she said about the enduring popularity of the show.
``It was family oriented with children and church and special
little things in it.
   ``I'd like for us to do another one now that I've slimmed down a
little (50 pounds worth). Every time I see myself in it, I say,
`Look at the Christmas tree.'''
   Reviewing her singing career, Parton says ``Islands in the
Stream'' remains special among the 47 single records she has
released.
   ``It's the one song in my whole career that I never get tired of
hearing or singing. If I hear it on the radio, I turn that song up,
and I usually don't do that with my records.
   ``It's such a pleasant song, easy listening. It's not heavy and
it's real positive. It was well written and has a great melody and
chord progression. And I think Kenny and me sang great together.
Our voices complimented each other.''
   A sequel to ``Trio,'' she says, is probably not forthcoming.
   ``It took us 10 years to get that one done. As busy as we all
are, it's not likely. We'd all love to see it happen, but the
chances are slim. And speaking for myself, you don't want to mess
with something good.''
   She says gimmicks have enhanced her image which has contributed
to her success as one of the nation's best known personalities.
   ``The way I look, being so outrageous ... the fact I look phony
and am real, has created a bit of a mystery and magic that works,''
she said.
   ``I try to have the gimmick, the big hair and loud clothes and
high heels and long fingernails. All of this is born out of a
serious place because the hair and heels give me height which I
want. But it works somehow. I wouldn't want to look simple. I'd
look like a blank wall.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Stage Fright May Have Saved Band's Career</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stage fright, that mysterious malady that
renders a performer helpless in the footlights, has been known to
wreck many a budding career.
   But in the case of the British rock band XTC, whose new record
``Oranges and Lemons'' is climbing the charts, it may actually have
helped.
   XTC was a struggling punk band in 1982 when leader Andy
Partridge, finding it more and more difficult to perform live,
collapsed on stage during a concert in Paris. It was his last live
performance. But instead of falling apart, XTC became studio
hermits and their music flowered.
   ``Rather than being a monotone creation, something red and blue,
suddenly there were all these colors coming out in the music that
we hadn't even considered putting in there,'' Partridge said in a
telephone interview from his home in the English town of Swindon.
   ``From (the 1982 album) `English Settlement' onward, our music
started getting a ... lot better,'' he said. ``But it wouldn't have
done that if we hadn't gone off the road. If we hadn't stopped
touring, I think in the space of a year the group would have split
up.''
   XTC's music is like a lost letter from the 1960s, a reflection
of the British psychedelic beat groups with which Partridge and
partners Colin Moulding and Dave Gregory grew up. Their innate
tunefulness is wedded to clever and occasionally provocative lyrics.
   And though Partridge is reluctant to publicly admit it, the
15-song ``Oranges and Lemons'' is the peak of a recording career
that began in 1978. The public thinks so; the record is at No. 47
on the Billboard charts, led by the single ``The Mayor of
Simpleton.''
   The breezy love song is a far cry from the group's last flirt
with public attention in the United States. The controversial
single ``Dear God'' drew protests in 1986 from fundamentalist
groups angered by the implicit endorsement of atheism.
   ``If people got upset by it, they deserved to get upset by it,''
Partridge said. ``It's the truth.''
   Actually, the 35-year-old musician said he's amused to attract
so much notoriety for a song he considered a failure. ``Dear God''
was initially left off the album ``Skylarking'' and released only
as a B-side to a single.
   Nothing on ``Oranges and Lemons'' is quite so explosive. ``The
Mayor of Simpleton'' attracts notice for the right reasons. It's a
sprightly melody with lyrics about a man who knows he can't impress
a woman with brains, so he does it with love.
   Partridge said he took from his own experience of being labeled
a failure for quitting school at age 15.
   ``In England you tend to get written off as nothing, as a piece
of air, if you left school and have no qualifications to do
anything,'' he said. ``I felt like I didn't need those things. I
felt my emotions were intact and I knew enough to get by. I felt
like I had kind of innate intelligence that didn't need to be put
in certificate form.''
   ``The Mayor of Simpleton'' is a love song that proves ``you
don't need those certificates to be able to feel emotionally,'' he
said.
   XTC's early music, through songs such as ``Making Plans for
Nigel'' and ``Generals and Majors,'' was known for its jerky
rhythms and hyperactive pace. Constant touring had something to do
with it. Partridge described the life as ``living on constant fear
pellets.''
   ``I started to get stage fright, which was rather ludicrous,''
he said. ``Because rather than getting more relaxed on stage, I was
getting less relaxed, more wound up.''
   Leaving the road allowed XTC to experiment with new instruments
and sounds, without the worry of having to reproduce the music on
stage. It allowed such influences as the Beatles and Hollies to
show.
   XTC acknowledged these debts with a spinoff band, called the
Dukes of Stratosphear. In two records, the Dukes eerily reproduced
the sound of their favorite '60s bands, particularly their
psychedelic sides. Partridge said it was a musical thank you note.
   ``I've always liked forgery,'' he said. ``I thought forgery was
a fine art. I used to forge money when I was a kid. I'd sit for
hours with different colored pens trying to get it right.''
   Partridge writes roughly 80 percent of the group's music, with
Moulding contributing a few songs per album. The trio handles
guitars and keyboards and hires a new drummer for each album
project since the group's original drummer, Terry Chambers, left
when the touring stopped. Mr. Mister drummer Pat Mastelotto handled
the sticks for the new record.
   Partridge is the father of two children, ages 3 and 1, and their
influence can also be seen in ``Oranges and Lemons.'' ``Garden of
Earthly Delights'' introduces a child to the wonders of the world
and ``Hold Me My Daddy'' is about coming to terms with love for a
father.
   ``They have not crept into the music,'' Partridge said of his
children. ``They've more sort of crawled and crashed in at five in
the morning. ... I think it's been very positive. They have been an
inspiration.''
   Executives at Geffen, XTC's label, initially tried to coax XTC
back on stage. But with the success of ``Skylarking'' and ``Oranges
and Lemons,'' Partridge said that's stopped. Since they're selling
more records than they ever did while touring, why argue with
success _ even if it contradicts standard industry practice.
   Partridge won't be spending his free time with the Dukes, who he
said were killed ``in a bizarre cooking accident.'' XTC is instead
thinking of recording a sampler album in which they imitate a
variety of bands and styles from the 1940s to the 1980s, he said.
   He chuckles at the thought that XTC, which pays such a heavy
debt to its own influences, is now influencing another generation
of music fans.
   ``It makes me feel like there's some kind of potent chemical
getting into their system,'' he said.

<HEAD>Schoolkids Increasingly Troubled By Stress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HORAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stress is turning kids into pencil-chewing,
teeth-gritting bundles of nerves, according to experts who say such
problems in early elementary school can lead to increased teen drug
use, sex and suicide.
   A survey of more than 4,000 Kansas kindergarten through third
graders showed that 42 percent experienced ``negative stress
behavior,'' which includes headaches, inability to sleep, biting
fingernails, worrying about doing poorly in school, stomach aches
and short tempers, said Darrel Lang, director of the Center of
Health Promotion and Wellness at Emporia State University.
   ``Here we are in Kansas, the middle of the country,
conservative, the pace is slower,'' said Lang. ``My feeling is that
larger communities in more populated states the stress levels in
kids are much higher.''
   Because stress ingrained at an early age generally remains with
children, the consequences in teen age can be devastating, he said.
Similar behavior was found through grade 12 in the survey of 18,000
Kansas students.
   ``Kids are more stressed out today because our society has more
stress,'' said Lang. ``It's a reflection of the society in which we
live. A lot of people think stress is an adult condition. Well,
it's not.''
   The stress kids are under in early childhood, from domineering
parents to broken homes to a more competitive society, is leading
children to higher rates of suicide, pregnancy, substance abuse, to
drop out and to health problems such as chronic heart disease and
obesity, experts say.
   The causes of stress are as varied as the consequences, but
experts agree the No. 1 source of kid stress is at home.
   ``If a child goes from a warm home to a cold school, they have a
chance of surviving. If they come from a warm home to a warm
school, of course they will make it, but if they come from a cold
home to a cold school, there is no way they will make it,'' said
Margaret Fitch, an assistant superintendent from Omaha, Neb., who
addressed a meeting on stress late last month.
   The problem has grown worse, educators say, because of an
increasingly competitive society and the growing number of
single-parent families _ all of which contribute to a lack of
communication.
   ``A typical parent communicates with their kid an average of 14
minutes a day,'' said Richard Nelson, associate professor of
education at the University of Kansas. ``And about 12 of those
minutes are spent discussing such unimportant things as what is for
dinner.''
   Another source of stress are parents who treat their children as
status symbols and instill a belief in the children that they must
behave right, wear the right clothes, make the right grades and
have the right friends.
   ``Those parents give their children conditional love,'' Nelson
said. ``They say, we will love you if...''
   Stressed children generally remain stressed as teens, he said.
``They can turn to drugs at an earlier age to reduce stress, engage
in sexual activities at an earlier age and it naturally leads to
higher rates of suicide.''
   A student committed suicide every nine days during the 1987-88
school year in Kansas and probably more than 1,000 others tried, he
said.
   Early childhood stress also can result in health problems such
as coronary heart disease, obesity and mental illness.
   ``Our health behaviors are established by the time we are 18 and
they are difficult to change,'' Lang said. ``If a child is under
stress at an early age, more than likely he will continue to be
throughout life.''
   Educators agree that a cornerstone in dealing with the problems
of early childhood stress is developing a student's self-concept or
self-esteem.
   ``We need to find ways at an early time in a child's life to
give children a sense of belonging, a sense of feeling good about
themselves,'' Fitch said.
   School districts need to keep class sizes down to provide for
better communication between students and teachers, the
teacher-to-student ratio needs to increase so kids can have an
adult friend to turn to, and schools need to put more emphasis on
teaching parents about parenting, she said. ``Sometimes parents
don't realize what is happening with their children.''
   Most of the 150 teachers who attended the conference last month
were aware that their students were under stress, but few had
talked about it with other educators, said Lang, who wrote ``Lazy
Dogs and Snoozing Frogs: Quieting and Relaxation Activities for
Children'' after conducting the study in Kansas.
   ``We had them look at high dropout rates, the fact that there
are over 1 million teen-age pregnancies a year, the increasing rate
of suicide and substance abuse,'' he said.
   ``We asked, how does it all come together? The answer was
stress.''
   Schools need to identify the problems of stress and look for
long-range solutions, Lang said. They should train students to cope
with stress, through breathing exercises, maintaining a proper diet
and increasing communication. In addition, stress is higher in
schools without physical education classes, which let students to
blow off some steam.
   ``People will always have stress in their lives,'' he said.
``It's a part of living. But what we need to do is train these kids
how to handle the stress, so they can live healthy and productive
lives.''

   Benjamin Franklin studied the Gulf Stream, and
pirates, smugglers and whalers kept an eye on it. But it took
satellites and computers to realize the current's role in weather,
fishing and even submarine warfare.
   The sweeping swirl of the Gulf Stream is 50 to 100 miles wide
and less than a mile deep. It's born in the Gulf of Mexico and
shinnies up the East Coast to Cape Hatteras, then shifts eastward
to the Grand Banks and Newfoundland, swings over to Europe and
eventually returns those chilly waters to the Sargasso Sea.
   On its way, the Gulf Stream _ caused by the interplay between
the Earth's rotation and winds driving the ocean's survace _ moves
not only warm water, but nutrients. This is important, at least as
far as fish are concerned, since it makes the stream hospitable
enough for fish to spend their lives in it.
   ``The Gulf Stream is really clear and really dark and certain
fish really like that,'' said Mitchell Roffer, who began studying
the current 10 years ago for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and now uses Soviet and U.S. satellites in advising
fishermen from Puerto Rico to Nova Scotia.
   Many fish like to congregate at the Gulf Stream's edge, where
coastal waters run up along side and get mixed around, said Roffer,
whose Miami-based service tells fishermen where these congregants
are found on a given day.
   The massive current was first identified in the 1500s by Juan
Ponce deLeon, who discovered Florida. In the days when sea lanes
were the only way across the Atlantic, ships destroyed by storms
drifted with the stream. Navigators drafted charts noting the
drifting wrecks. They didn't know it, but they were charting the
route of the Gulf Stream current that swept the wrecks along. But
it wasn't until the 18th century that the Gulf Stream made its way
onto a map.
   The most famous effort to identify the Gulf Stream was
undertaken in the 1770s by Franklin, then a shipping agent in
Philadelphia, with the help of his cousin Timothy Folger, a whaler
from Nantucket. Franklin's interest was sparked by complaints from
colonists that mail took a couple weeks longer to come from Europe
than it did when sent east, riding the stream part of the way.
   Computers and satellites are finally unlocking the secrets of
the current.
   ``It's the first part of the ocean we actually are
forecasting,'' said Scott Glenn, an oceanographer in Harvard
University's Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences who helped
Allan Robinson develop the Harvard Gulfcast, the first ocean
forecasting system to predict the stream's daily variations.
   ``People have been making models of the Gulf Stream, but this is
the first time they have been applied to forecasting,'' Glenn said.
   Financed by the Navy for use with submarines, the Gulfcast is
also of interest to shipping companies looking for a fast ride,
meteorologists trying to get a grip on the atmosphere and even
pleasure boaters. The Navy's specific interest is in the warm
fronts where temperature differentials play havoc with the
underwater acoustics used by submarine detectors.
   William MacLeish, former editor of Oceanus magazine and author
of the book, ``The Gulf Stream: Encounters with the Blue God,''
said the current ``makes it possible for you and me to have a
fairly decent existence.''
   ``The Gulf Stream is part of the circulation of the whole
ocean,'' said oceanographer Carl Wunsch of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. ``It ... transports heat from near the
equator toward the polar regions. It makes the mid-latitudes of the
Earth habitable.
   ``We have a much milder winter than they have in Kansas because
we're close to a water system that stores a lot of heat.''
   Those who study global warming are checking out the Gulf Stream,
too. One theory holds that if subpolar warming becomes too great,
the stream will weaken because a smaller difference in temperature
lowers the velocity of the stream's engine. Europe would chill out
as a result. Another theory predicts the warming will expand the
already warm Sargasso Sea. Westerlies would move that warmed air to
Europe and turn the continent into a steam bath.
   ``Take your choice,'' MacLeish said. ``We are living in great
peril.''

<HEAD>Communities Around Observatory Cooperate in Reducing Light Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FORT DAVIS, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sky is black and the stars are
shining brightly above McDonald Observatory, but a faint glow can
be spotted from the lights of Alpine, 26 miles east on the far side
of the Davis Mountains.
   Aurora commercialis, Robert Scheppler calls the lights.
   But thanks to cooperative neighbors, good location and a dry
climate, McDonald Observatory suffers from much less of this light
pollution than most major U.S. observatories, said Scheppler, the
chief of visitor services.
   ``The observatory gets along very well with its neighbors. The
authorities in those towns really try to cooperate with us.''
   The observatory has persuaded local governments to install
street lights that create less problems. Fort Davis High School,
which began night football games only after a 1985 law discouraged
day games to keep sports and classroom time from overlapping, turns
off its stadium lights promptly after games. And a bill before the
Legislature that would let local officials regulate outdoor
lighting; without it counties can pass ordinances but not enforce
them.
   ``Of the existing observatories, we're the darkest,'' said Jeff
Davis County Judge Ann Scudday. ``Everyone in this area benefits
from the observatory as far as tourism.'' In addition, just about
everyone in the town of 900 knows someone who works at the
observatory.
   ``When you're this small, you have to try to get along,'' said
school board President Kimball Miller. ``You know people as
people.''
   The country's best-known observatories, Palomar near San Diego
and Kitt Peak near Tucson, Ariz., don't have the advantage of
small-town relations, said Scheppler. Both have to deal with many
surrounding communities to limit light.
   ``It can be dark, but when you talk about how much light is
scientifically debilitating, you run into problems long before most
people would think there's a problem,'' Scheppler said.
   Much of McDonald's work involves spectroscopy, and the spectrum
viewed by the telescopes isn't continous. Some colors are brighter
than normal and others are missing. The missing colors are
identified by ``absorption lines,'' which reveal the composition of
a star's atmosphere and stellar temperature, motion relative to the
Earth and rotation, among other things.
   ``Light is just packed with information our eyes just don't pick
out,'' he said. ``The difference between what you can see when you
look at the star with your eyes and opening up its spectrum is the
difference between looking at the shadow of a book on the ground
and opening it up and reading it.''
   McDonald Observatory is in an almost ideal place for such
studies. It's at the top of 6,800-foot Mount Locke, where the air
is clear and stable. It seldom rains and mountains block most light
from Fort Davis, Marfa and Alpine.
   But some of the light does pollute the sky, and astronomers are
especially hampered by mercury-vapor lamps and lights that point up.
   Mercury-vapor lamps are the bluish-green streetlights common in
most cities and towns. Astronomers would prefer to see them
exchanged for low-pressure sodium lamps that cast a peachy or
yellowish light.
   ``Mercury-vapor lamps produce lots of absorption lines, so it's
like looking at the spectrum through a picket fence,'' Scheppler
said. Sodium lamps have fewer absorption lines, ``like looking
through a two-slat picket fence.''
   The bill before the Legislature would let local governments near
major observatories mandate the use of low-pressure sodium lights
and hoods to keep lights from shining into the night sky.
   Unhooded lights and billboard lamps aren't a problem around
McDonald, Scheppler said. The biggest potential culprit is the
stadium lighting at Fort Davis High, but officials are
conscientious about its use and ``it's only about three hours a
night, four or five nights a year, so it's not a big problem.''
   Surrounding cities still use a few mercury-vapor lamps. Jeff
Davis County plans to switch to sodium this spring. Alpine, which
creates most of the light pollution seen at McDonald Observatory,
has replaced about 200 mercury-vapor lamps with sodium lights and
will replace the rest as they burn out.
   ``We don't have a lot of light pollution today,'' said J.B.
Tabor, manager of West Texas Utilities in Alpine. ``What we're
really trying to do is prevent it in the future.''

to do is prevent it in the future.''

<HEAD>Ethicist Throws Light On Animal Life And Death Questions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As treatment of animals goes beyond neutering the
family cat and de-worming the dog, veterinarians face ethics
questions like physicians do.
   Should Fido be put to sleep? Does Bossie the cow deserve more
respect? Is the health of a race horse more important than the
owner's bottom line?
   ``The vet serves both the animal and the human community and is
caught in the middle,'' said Jerrold Tannenbaum, who teaches
veterinary law and ethics at the Tufts School of Veterinary
Medicine in Boston and North Grafton.
   Tannenbaum, 43, has offered guidelines for puzzling out
solutions to animal life-and-death questions in his new book,
``Veterinary Ethics.''
   Such questions stem in part from a growing appreciation of the
place pets hold in owners' livess. ``Certainly animals are not
people, but many people now regard pets as members of the family.
Part of what we're involved in here is the definition of these
beings. How high should they be regarded?''
   Animals, like people, can now benefit from expensive treatments.
Dogs can get pacemakers for $800 to $1,000 and hip replacements
costing upwards of $1,000. Cats undergo cancer chemotherapy for
around $1,000.
   Ethical issues arise when a vet is caught between advising the
use of such care and a pet owner who can't afford or doesn't want
to pay what it costs.
   They also extend to other animals: drugging thoroughbreds to
make them go faster, for example, or feeding cows antibiotics and
other drugs that put more meat on the table but could block
symptoms of animal suffering.

<HEAD>Tiny Shrimp May Point Way to Titanium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STATESBORO, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ghost shrimp, seldom-seen crustaceans
that have lived for eons beneath beach sand, may provide fossilized
clues that can help geologists locate valuable titanium deposits in
the Southeast.
   Igneous and metamorphic rocks that form the Piedmont area and
Blue Ridge mountains contain traces of titanium-rich heavy
minerals. As the rocks weather into sand and clay, particles are
carried down rivers and deposited along the coast. Waves and
currents sort the particles by size and density, depositing the
heavy minerals on some parts of the beach.
   ``The ghost shrimp that I'm studying ... appears to be almost
restricted to the beaches, and the heavy minerals are accumulating
on the beaches,'' said geologist Gale Bishop. ``If we can identify
burrows of that species in the past, we should be able to find
heavy mineral deposits.''
   Heavy minerals like rutile and ilmenite contain titanium, a
strong, light metal used by the space industry. Titanium oxide
whitens paints and papers.
   Bishop, of Georgia Southern College, is pumping up ghost shrimp
from beaches along the coast and recording their distribution,
shapes, size and claw types. The shrimp are seldom seen, living out
their lives deep in sandy burrows and feeding on organic debris,
bacteria and nutrients filtered from the water.
   ``What we hope to see is the upper part of the burrow, the
vertical shaft which would indicate we're near the sea-level of the
past. It might indicate heavy mineral deposits nearby,'' Bishop
said. ``The similarity of geological conditions ... in the
Carolinas, Georgia and northern Florida should indicate that heavy
mineral deposits could be found in any of these areas.''

<HEAD>`Not In My Backyard Wall' The Response To Sludge Bricks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Alleman has encountered more
than the ``not-in-my-backyard'' syndrome in trying to deal with
sewage sludge _ people who hear of his ``biobricks'' generally say
not in my wall.
   The environmental engineer worked with a Maryland manufacturer
to make bricks that have been used in two park shelters in
Washington, D.C., and two sewage treatment plants for the
Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission.
   More recently, he's discovered that even sludge laden with
hazardous metals can be put into the clay-sludge mixture that is
fired into bricks. Alleman has been unable to extract the metal
except with the strongest acids.
   ``We soaked them in an acid solution to simulate acid rain and
we couldn't get the metals back out. We had such a hard time we had
to dissolve the bricks. We had to use hydroflouric acid _ the
strongest acid we have,'' he said.
   Of course, if builders have an aversion to bricks made with
normal sludge, they're even less likely to use bricks made with
hazardous metals like nickel, arsenic, cadmium, chrome and lead _
no matter how safe they are.
   ``There's a lot of inorganic sludge with hazardous wastes in it.
You can't put it on farmers' lands, because the crops would be
contaminated with it,'' Alleman said. ``Those kinds of sludge are
ideal candidates for bricks.''
   He estimated that American cities dispose of 6,000 to 10,000
tons of sludge a day. Some bury it, others burn it and a few still
dump it in the ocean.
   The key to Alleman's process is the brick-making kiln, which
operates at 2,000 degrees over two days to bake the 50-50 mixture
of clay and sludge into bricks. In the process, any organic matter
in the sludge is burned away and any hazardous metals are fused
permanently into the brick.
   ``If I were a brick manufacturer, I would find somebody to pay
me to take sludge off their hands. It's easy. You need very hose work is

   The North American Waterfowl Management Plan, a $1.5 billion
United States -Canadian effort to restore dwindling duck
populations in the U.S., could receive the blessing of Congress
this year.
   It would give legal sanction and possibly legal tender to the
plan signed by the interior secretaries of the two countries in
May, 1986.
   The proposed legislation by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, is the most encouraging thing that's happened
involving the plan, said Charles H. Collins, executive director of
the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the group charged with
implementing the U.S. part of the plan.
   Mitchell pledged he would introduce ``The North American
Wetlands Conservation Act'' in April.
   ``A primary goal of the legislation would be to halt the decline
of many species of ducks, geese and other migratory birds through
the implementation of the North American Waterfowl Management
Plan,'' Mitchell said.
   The legislation calls for spending $25 to $30 million a year to
cover Washington's share of costs in the 15-year plan.
   Ducks Unlimited has pledged nearly $500 million over the life of
the plan.
   The Canadian government and provinces have pledged more
millions, and the states are beginning to make contributions.
   Meanwhile, a first series of projects under the plan is being
realized, and a second series is on the drawing boards.
   Ducks Unlimited and the Nature Conservancy, both private groups,
have signed a preliminary agreement to acquire and improve
waterfowl habitat.
   ``They are particularly talented in acquiring the land, and we
have special expertise in the management of land and water,'' said
Matt Connolly, executive vice president of DU. ``Working together
we can be a lot more effective.''
   The partnership has started four projects, one in each of the
major duck flyways.
   They are located at Central Cheyenne Bottoms, Kansas, the major
inland staging area for shorebirds on the north American continent;
Bodcau Bayou in Louisiana; Ace Basin near Charleston, S.E.; and the
Cosumnes River drainage, the last undammed river in California. The
latter is a major wintering area for tundra swans, cranes, pintails
and snow geese, said Connolly, chairman of the North American
plan's implementation board, representing conservation, fisheries
and forestry groups.
   ``I believe private sector, as shown by the groups on the board,
is working together. The fruits of our labors are beginning to
show. The Quill Lakes project in Saskatchewan is about to be
baptized.''
   That project, a first-step project under the plan, involved
acquiring land, building wetlands and protecting upland habitat for
ducks. The area is getting its first drenching of rain and snow
this spring.
   Connolly said he was worried despite coordinated efforts in
spending $9.3 million on second-step projects under the North
American plan. ``One of my concerns is when we start getting $50
million or $60 million, then the occasional slippages of the bad
side of humanity will come out.''
   The group, he said, is not ready to handle that kind of money
because there are no formal agreements and criteria.
   ``In three years, we have come a very long way,'' he said. ``But
if we were fortunate to have someone give us $100 million right
now, we don't have the infrastructure, don't have the priorities
identified, to judiciously spend the money.''
   Spending large sums of money across international borders often
is a complicated business, he said. ``We're learning a lot about
dealing with governments, dealing with land and ownership.''
   ``We are maturing,'' he said.

   Although there was enough snow on the prairie this winter to
bring some hope for a recovery of the continent's duck population,
there's little chance of a rebound this fall.
   Preliminary data from U.S. Fish and Wildlife wing surveys this
winter show reproduction last summer was poor to terrible. The
service says this fall's hunting regulations probably will be as
restrictive as those of last season.
   ``Part of it is so dry, it's going to take a lot of water to
bring it back up to average,'' said Bob Meeks, regional operations
supervisor at Ducks Unlimited's Great Plains regional office. ``The
cover has to grow back.''
   ``Wing receipts indicate that species like mallards, pintails,
blue wings (teal) and even wood ducks have had a poor reproductive
season,'' explained Rollin D. Sparrowe, who oversees migratory
birds for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Preliminary data show the harvest of pintails and mallards was
cut sharply by last year's restrictive regulations, Sparrowe said.
``If, in fact, habitat improvement is better than early indications
are this spring, we hope there will be birds to take advantage of
it.''
   His information paints a grim picture of duck populations.
   For pintails last year in the Pacific flyway there were only 50
juveniles per 100 adults last year, down from 85 juveniles per 100
in 1987 and 100 juveniles per 100 adults in 1985.
   Biologists agree a healthy population is at least 150 juveniles
per 100 adults, ``the higher the better.''
   The ratio for mallards in the Mississippi flyway was 89
juveniles per 100 adults, compared to 136 juveniles per 100 adults
in 1987. The ratio for mallards in the Central flyway was 53
juveniles per 100 adults, compared to 94 per 100 in 1987.
   The Atlantic flyway fared better, with 168 juveniles per 100
adults, but down from a 2-1 ratio in 1987.
   Wood ducks in the Mississippi flyway produced 126 young per 100
adults, down from 169 in 1987 and 216 in 1986.
   ``That's the kind of thing we forecast and the reason we took
strong restrictive action last year,'' Sparrowe said.
   Meeks said there have been good winter snows in large parts of
the prairie country of Minnesota, the Dakotas, Montana and the
Canadian prairie country, but water accumulations from March to
June this year will be critical.
   In Montana, he said, ``a lot of projects that we've been looking
at never took a drop of water last year. They're already filled
this year.''
   ``We have moisture for the first time, but we do need a lot more
to get to average conditions,'' he said.
   That means two things.
   Remaining snow has to run off, over frost seal on the ground,
and into the ponds.
   There has to be enough spring rain to restore ground water and
soil moisture so ponds that fill in early spring don't dry out by
summer.
   Then there must be vegetation.
   There, the Conservation Reserve Program has helped in the United
States, Meeks said.
   Many farmland tracts left idle last year have some scrub and
stubble, he said, ``and that's a dang sight better than if they had
been plowed over and were brown ground.''
   Puddle ducks, such as mallards, have some chances to find nests,
which they typically build a half mile from water.
   ``But Canada didn't have that and that's where the bulk of the
ducks come from,'' he said.
   Areas that were ponds were dry, and farmers plowed right through
them.
   Overwater nesters, such as canvasbacks, need some type of
cattail or other vegetation that's in a pothole to build a nest,
Meeks said. ``Where that's been removed for whatever reason,
burning, plowing, there's nothing there for them. They can't build
nests.
   ``Those are the ones for which it will take the longest to
recover from a drought when habitat around the pothole has been
totally altered,'' Meeks said.

<TEXT>
   For the traveler who feels more fear
than freedom during a high-speed hurtle along West Germany's
infamous autobahns, touring the Rhine River valley on two wheels
offers solace as well as scenery.
   From the famous rock of Lorelei, where the legendary siren lured
sailors to their deaths, to the majestic twin towers of Cologne's
14th century cathedral, some of the renowned valley's most splendid
sights are best reached and enjoyed from the seat of a bicycle.
   The 800-mile Rhine River sweeps from the Swiss Alps to the Dutch
North Sea coast. It threads a gentle and inspiring path through the
Black Forest, centuries-old spas where European royalty once
rested, windmill-studded farmland and vineyards ripe with the scent
of next fall's Riesling.
   Dozens of castles, from jagged ruins to restored Medieval
estates that now offer lodging or riverfront dining, dapple the
hillsides flanking the flat winding paths along the river's most
popular and attractive stretch, from Mainz to the capital city of
Bonn.
   The sport of cycling and combined exercise and travel have been
booming over the past decade as West Germans have become more
concerned about their health and the environment.
   Two out of three West Germans own a bicycle, and sales of the
two-wheeled vehicles now run nearly double the volume of cars sold
here, according to ADFC, the national bicycling association that
claims more than 25,000 members.
   Dovetailing the surge in cycling interest among West Germans and
foreign tourists has been a corresponding growth of separate
bicycle paths, touring clubs, guide services and repair shops that
has helped make the endeavor safer and more accessible.
   ``Although there has been a sharp increase in the number of
cyclists over the past few years, the number of accidents and
fatalities involving bicycles has been steadily decreasing,'' said
Karl-Ludwig Kelber, head of Bonn's ADFC chapter.
   The number of bicyclist fatalities dropped from 1,142 in 1980 to
730 in 1987, the last year for which statistics are available,
primarily because of the broader development of bike paths away
from the heavily traveled highways. In comparison, there were more
than 8,000 auto fatalities in West Germany last year.
   Despite the improved safety record and unique protections for
cyclists _ including a federal law requiring cars to pass no closer
than 5 feet _ a bicycling vacation is not for everyone.
   The ADFC and private touring services recommend that
inexperienced cyclists avoid attempting long journeys without being
accompanied by a professional guide.
   Travelers can arrange guided tours or individual itineraries
with guide services that transport bikes to the starting point and
carry baggage by minivan from one overnight stop to the next.
   West German trains also transport bicycles for a nominal fee,
allowing travelers who choose to chart their own course to skip
over some of the most polluted stretches of the river and the most
heavily industrialized areas that scar the landscape.
   Food and lodging abound along the highly developed Rhine, and
travelers can also arrange special-interest bicycle trips such as a
tour of the valley's numerous small wineries.
   The ADFC has collected and published a detailed two-volume
guidebook to the Rhine River bike paths, covering the entire
waterway from its headwaters near St. Gotthard, Switzerland, to its
delta outflow at Hoek van Holland.
   The books, which are published in German but contain notes and
glossaries in English and Dutch, describe path conditions,
sightseeing opportunities, hotel and restaurant facilities and the
location of shops that rent bikes or repair them.
   There are also recommendations on when to cross from one side of
the north-flowing river to the other, making use of the more than
100 bridges and ferries crossing the waterway to take the more
scenic route or avoid ``anti-bicycle'' strongholds where cyclists
are expected to dismount and walk.
   General information about cycling in West Germany and bike path
maps of specific regions are available by mail from the ADFC's
national headquarters: ADFC, Postfach 107744, 2800 Bremen, West
Germany.
   But for detailed planning of a trip and information about group
or guided tours, the organization recommends cyclists contact a
travel agent or the ADFC's commercial tour operator, Velomobil, at
the Bremen address.

   The smallmouth bass, or bronzeback, evolved primarily as a
resident of the clear rivers and lakes of the Northeast, but they
have been transplanted all over the country, often sharing the same
lakes if not quite the same habitat as their largemouth cousins.
   To catch smallmouth, ``fish smaller baits on necessarily lighter
line,'' said Ken Cook of Meers, Okla. Cook is a fisheries biologist
who has used his knowledge to become one of the top anglers on the
tournament trail.
   The lighter line doesn't weigh down the lighter lures and is
harder for fish to see in the clearer water usually preferred by
smallmouth bass.
   The smallmouth, Cook said, grows larger in Southern waters than
in its native habitat because the season for feeding and growing is
longer. They also grow larger in lakes than in rivers because in a
river, ``current causes fish to use a lot of growth energy
surviving.''
   Smallmouth and largemouth bass may be found in the same lake,
but look for the smallmouth in different areas than those where
you'll find his bigger cousin.
   ``Look for the clear part of the lake with deeper, rockier
shorelines,'' Cook said. ``These fish tend to associate with those
types of areas, compared with the shallower, muddy area preferred
by the largemouth.''
   Smallmouth tend to spawn in rocky flats, often those with large
boulders.
   ``Ideally, the water will be clear enough that you can see the
beds, shiny spots on the bottom,'' he said. ``If I can see the
fish, I try to pick out the big ones. You can pick out the one
you're going to try to catch.''
   Catching them is ``a matter of reading the fish and the pattern
or situation they're in. Sometimes it's easy, sometimes much more
difficult,'' he said.
   ``My No. 1 bait of choice would be a grub or another small piece
of plastic you can put on the bed. The fish will defend its
territory from that intrusion.''
   The first pass may tell you whether you are going to catch that
fish.
   ``Some of them leave and don't come back right away. I don't
figure those are going to be catchable,'' Cook said. If the fish
looks at the bait but doesn't hit it, keep trying. Stay away from
the bed and use long casts so you don't spook the fish.''
   If the fish hits on the first pass, it could mean you're going
to have a lot of fishing fun that day.
   If the grub doesn't work, Cook will switch to a jerkbait or
balsa minnow.
   ``I use a Bill Norman Baltic Minnow, in the brighter colors _
blue with an orange belly, for example. The fish tend to get mad at
those colors. It seems like they bite them,'' Cook said. ``Cast
past the bed and reel down to the level where the fish are, then
jerk real hard so it thumps in the water.
   ``Get it close to the fish and let it float up. That seems to
anger the fish, and they'll go for it.
   ``If I can't catch that fish that way, I'll go look for another
one,'' Cook said.
   That's not too difficult, he said, because beds are often only
20 or 30 feet apart. He'll note where big ones are hanging out and
try for them again later.
   After spawning, smallmouth go off to deeper water and sulk.
``They're tired, and they're not really in such a good mood,'' Cook
said. ``They back off to a good, safe area, rocky or stumpy _ a
breakline or a dropoff _ and they'll suspend off it.''
   Hunger pangs eventually end the sulking, and the fish swim out
to deeper water, looking for lunch.
   ``They stay on offshore humps, dropoffs, some kind of offshore
structure, into the fall,'' Cook said.
   Fall is a peak feeding time, and smallmouth work their way back
inshore to take crawfish and a wide assortment of dinner items.
   ``Crawfish are a favorite, but they're like any other bass. They
eat whatever is the most available,'' Cook said. ``I like to know
what's most available.''
   Cook won the 1987 Bass Anglers Sportsman Society New York
Invitational tournament at Thousand Islands by using lures to
imitate emerald shiners and yellow perch, the foods he felt the
smallmouth were using there.
   Whatever you try, he said, keep lures small and fish lighter
line if you want to catch smallmouth.

   The angler who is successful catching bass in a
river system is the one who fishes the main river in the hottest
weather but prowls the sloughs and backwaters the rest of the time,
according to George Cochran of North Little Rock, Ark.
   ``The only time I catch a lot of fish on the river itself is in
the hottest part of the summer, usually about June to August or
September,'' said Cochran, considered one of the best fishermen on
the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society roster. The rest of the year, he
looks to the backwaters and isn't above shoving an 18-foot boat
through 3 inches of water and 2 feet of muck to get there.
   ``That's where they spend the winter. That's where they're
spawning, and a lot of them never leave that backwater, never go
out into that river,'' he said in an interview.
   For many bass, however, time to migrate to the main river comes
when the backwater gets warm and stagnant.
   If you decide to fish a backwater, ``you want to find the
largest backwater in the area where you're going to be fishing,''
he said.
   ``Usually in rivers, bass don't live any deeper than 5 feet.
There's an exception to every rule, but 99 percent of the time bass
don't live any deeper than 5 feet.''
   One exception to the 5-foot rule is in exceptionally clear
water, where the fish will be living deeper, he said.
   So he uses lures that work at all depths in water to 5 feet
deep, or the top five feet of deeper water: plastic worms,
spinnerbaits and fairly shallow diving or surface crankbaits.
   In the main river, three basic types of cover attract bass:
wood, rocks and sand.
   ``Rivers are full of sand. There are sandbar points and sandbar
banks,'' Cochran explained. ``Bass hang out around this sand
because the baitfish and shad cruise the sand. They feed along
those sandy banks. I've noticed I catch more fish now than ever on
those banks.''
   In addition to fallen trees or snags, look for docks, boat
ramps, old pilings, boat houses or rockpile banks.
   ``Basically, the same three baits work, but I fish a lot of
topwater baits because the fish will suspend. They will be around
the pilings or riprap, but they will suspend over it.
   ``A lot of times a topwater bait is the best for the first two
or three hours in the morning and the last two or three hours in
the evening, and you can use crankbaits or worms though the day,''
Cochran said.
   Spring is the best time to fish the backwaters because ``most
rivers are dingy or dirty at that time of year,'' and bass are
spawning in the backwaters.
   ``I look for the biggest backwater that is clear,'' Cochran
said. ``The bass will get as far away from that river as they can''
looking for clear, still water in which to spawn.
   ``I look for little ponds, sloughs. Even if you have to get out
and push and shove, you can get into some real good areas,'' he
said. He uses the same baits, but plastic worms usually work the
best, ``standard colors, black and blue.''
   ``When they spawn, you can see the fins on their backs out of
the river. They get so shallow it's unbelievable,'' he said. ``A
lot of times you can see the water muddying up, like a carp around
the bank, but it will be the bass.''
   He recommended using brightly colored spinnerbaits, such as
yellow or chartreuse, on backwaters in early spring.

<TEXT>
   Walleye fishing is one of the fastest-growing outdoor sports,
and Bob Kaczkowski believes the toothy cousin of the perch may be
the most sought-after catch in the country in the 21st century.
   The walleye is a northern river fish which has been transplanted
as far south as Louisiana and to the west side of the Rockies.
   ``I predict in the next 10 years, almost nationwide, walleye
fishing is going to be it. All the way from New York to the state
of Washington, it's going bonkers,'' said Kaczkowski, who is an
avid walleye angler and executive director of the Franklin,
Wis.-based Manufacturers Walleye Council, which operates the
nation's major walleye tournament circuit.
   While walleye can be caught all year, even through the ice in
winter, spring is when the fishing really can get good.
   ``With spring walleye, often it's feast or famine,'' said
Kaczkowski. ``It sometimes seems like your fishing for nothing for
hours on end, then in 20 minutes two of you can have limits.
   ``They always school tight. Usually, if you find one, you're
going to find a ton of them. Spring fishing is very, very
rewarding.''
   There are two groups of walleyes _ those which spawn in rivers
and those confined to lakes.
   The walleye run begins in fall, as the fish move to staging
areas in the deepest holes they can find.
   The action begins when the water warms up to 45 degrees, and
since rivers warm up sooner than lakes, it begins there first. Then
the lake walleyes that head upriver to spawn make their move.
   In the lakes there are two types of walleyes _ those that spawn
in shallow water up against the bank and those that use offshore
points, humps or bars as spawning areas. The shoreline spawners get
active first.
   Spawning actually begins when females join the males in very
shallow water, usually between midnight and dawn, and the males
prod the females into dropping her eggs. Then they fertilize them.
   The best way to catch spawning walleye is with a lead-head jig
tipped with a minnow, Kaczkowski said.
   ``It's critical the fisherman match the current speed and depth
of water with the weight of the jig. You don't want to be jigging
and have the thing swept right down the stream because no
self-respecting walleye is going to chase it downriver after he's
just swum 10 miles upriver,'' he said. ``You want it heavy enough
so that when you lift if off the bottom it just eases downstream a
little bit.''
   Another method is the Wolf River rig, named after the famous
walleye river in Wisconsin. There are many local variations, but
it's basically a three-eye swivel with a sinker on light line
attached to one eye, a leader with a minnow attached to the second
and the angler's line tied to the third.
   It keeps the minnow swimming just off the bottom in the current.
   Kaczkowski said a third trick is the slip bobber with a minnow
hanging below. Allow the wind or current to carry the bobber, and
minnow, into snags or swampy areas where it's difficult to cast a
lure. You can adjust your bait to any depth below the bobber.
   Trolling lures, or nightcrawlers, also are popular, particularly
on big lakes, such as walleye-rich Lake Erie.
   In the spring, that means using small minnows because natural
wild minnows are small.
   ``Even big walleye _ I mean 10-pound walleye _ often prefer
those smaller minnows in the spring,'' Kaczkowski said. ``When I go
out in the spring walleye fishing, I always take two or three sizes
of minnows, because if you buy a couple dozen and they are all the
same size and the fish don't want them, then what?''
   While the overwhelming choice of bait in the spring is the
minnow, sometimes, ``when the fish are aggressive, half a
nightcrawler, a teaser, just enough to cover the hook portion of
the jig, also works,'' he said. ``Later, they'll go for small,
whole crawlers and leaches.''
   Artificial bait specialists should use small stickbaits, such as
Rapalas.
   ``When they're shallow, you can get them on a stickbait, or
anything with a tight wobble. Anything that has too much of a
wobble is not attractive to walleye,'' Kaczkowski said.
   The tournament circuit, he said, has debunked the idea that
walleye are only caught at night.
   ``I've had a lot of success between 9 a.m. and noon and during
the mid-afternoon hours,'' Kaczkowski said. ``On the Manufacturers
Walleye Council circuit we have found out, based on the experience
of 3,025 fishermen last year, most of our walleyes are caught
between 11 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon _ and the bigger
fish have come on very hot, bright days.
   ``Believe it or not, the largest fish caught on our circuit, a
12{ pounder, was caught at noon in 3{ feet of water on a midlake
hump.''

   Keep fish alive in your boat with clean, cool
water, oxygen, and chemical treatment to calm the fish and help
them recover from injuries, including the touch of your hands.
   ``About the most important thing is the way you handle the fish
in the first place,'' said Tony Gergley, vice president of Jungle
Laboratories Corp., which has been studying ways to keep fish alive
in aquariums and livewells.
   ``Use heavy enough tackle in the first place to bring the fish
in without exhausting it, and then be careful handling it when you
take the hook out,'' he said in an interview from his Cibolo,
Texas, office. ``We don't recommend the use of nets, although I
know a lot of people use them. But they can tear up a fish too bad,
can hurt them too much.''
   Gergley and the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society ran an experiment
at major BASSmaster tournaments last year ``and we did not lose a
fish,'' he said.
   Livewells in boats were treated with Catch and Release, made by
Jungle Laboratories, and water inside was cooled with ice.
   Catch and Release is a tranquilizer and water conditioner. It
also adds electrolytes to water to restore them to the fish.
   The water treatment also stimulates slime protection by fish.
When a fish is stressed by being caught and handled, the cells
which produce slime ``clamp up,'' Gergley said. ``Taking off the
slime is like taking the skin off a human. You are going to get
infection.''
   Lower the water temperature in the livewell about 15 degrees
from lake water temperature.
   ``In a good-sized livewell, five to eight pounds of ice at one
time will not hurt your fish,'' Gergley said. ``I think they will
love you for it.''
   The best way to monitor water temperature is to put an aquarium
thermometer in the livewell, he said. The experiments with BASS, he
added, ``disproved the old wives' tale that you can't drop
temperature on bass or it will kill them.''
   Finally, make sure the water in the livewell is clean. If you
get your boat in very shallow water and the pump sucks mud into the
livewell, change the water, even if it means you have to dip it out.
   ``It's less harmful to the fish to change the water and leave
them out of water for a minute or two than to leave them in dirty
water,'' he said.
   New boats, he said, have aeration and recirculating systems in
livewells, making the livewells in-boat aquariums. Older livewells
circulate water from below the boat into the livewell.
   By keeping your fish alive, you can return to the water those
you don't need for a tournament or don't want for dinner. They can
grow and be caught another time.

   When it comes to hiking in the Southeast, North Carolina wants
you to think of North Carolina.
   Hiking trails in the Tar Heel State are used more than any other
trails in the nation, according to the U.S. Forest Service. More
than 500,000 recreation visitor days are recorded each year.
   ``Hiking is one of our key trail activities,'' says Melinda
Waldrep, trail specialist and landscape architect for the U.S.
Forest Service in Asheville, N.C. ``Our area is unique because of
our waterfalls, rock features and because the Southern Appalachians
have the largest number of plant species in the world.''
   National park land in the state includes the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park, with 900 miles of maintained hiking
trails, the Nantahala National Forest and the Pisgah National
Forest.
   Travelers who are unfamiliar with the area can take day or
half-day hiking trips with the Sierra Club or the Carolina Mountain
Club. Or they can try unguided but well-marked trails inside local
private parks such as Chimney Rock in Lake Lure, 25 miles southeast
of Asheville, or Grandfather Mountain, the highest peak in the Blue
Ridge range, at 5,964 feet.
   The Carolina Mountain Club publishes a guide, ``100 Favorite
Trails of the Great Smokies and Carolina Blue Ridge,'' written by
club member Bernard Elias. The club has conducted more than 6,000
hiking trips around Asheville since it was established in 1931.
   ``There is an interesting companionship that develops on a hike
with a group from this area,'' says Elias. ``It's a good way to get
to talk to each other away from the distractions of city life. You
get a feeling of closeness with the wonders of nature and a real
appreciation of life.''
   Some of the trails recommended by Elias include:
   _ The Mountains to the Sea Trail, part of a 750-mile path that
will eventually stretch between the Smoky Mountains and the eastern
coast of North Carolina. The trail, surrounded by thick green
forests, is open for the first time this year.
   _ The Shut-in Trail, a 16-mile trail running parallel to the
Blue Ridge Parkway, offers stunning overlooks into the valleys
below. It's a full-day hike one way.
   _ Blue Ridge Pinnacle, near Mount Mitchell off the Blue Ridge
Parkway, is a three-mile round-trip hike.
   _ Horsepasture River trail has waterfalls and many hikers take
along bathing suits for a dip in the falls or river along the way,
says Elias.

   Every year, thousands of tourists roam
through North Carolina's mountains on trails that range from short
``leg-stretchers'' along the Blue Ridge Parkway to long-distance
treks through the remote wilderness.
   Some end up lost, others with injuries that run from sprains to
broken legs. A few die from falls, exposure or over-exertion.
   Here are some tips from experts on hiking in the mountains:
   _ Pick the right clothes. Wear hiking boots or a good pair of
sneakers with deep tread, heavy socks and loose-fitting,
long-legged pants. A T-shirt is fine in moderate weather, but carry
a sweater or wind breaker that can be tied around the waist. And
take a hat, even if it's just a baseball cap. Add more clothing as
the weather becomes more extreme.
   ``Wearing a pair of thin, nylon socks with hiking boots is about
like going barefoot,'' said Jeff Wahoo Stanley, owner of Wahoo's
Outdoor Adventures in Boone. ``We've found that some of the best
pants for hiking are just ordinary sweatpants _ the kind with a
drawstring waist. They protect your legs, but they're comfortable
and warm.''
   _ Carry a minimum amount of equipment. Anyone going into the
woods, even on a short hike, should carry a pocket knife, a
cigarette lighter, water and a few first-aid supplies. A small
day-pack can hold lunches and enough supplies for several people.
   _ Choose the right trail. Steep, rugged trails might be fine for
an experienced 30-year-old hiker. But a 6-year-old or novice hiker
doesn't need that much of a challenge. Check with outfitters or
other local experts about available trails, their degree of
difficulty and hazards.
   _ Make sure someone knows where you are. Always tell someone
what trail you intend to take and your estimated return time.
   _ Never hike alone. ``The worst thing you can do is go out by
yourself because you never know what can happen,'' said Tom Collins
of the Watauga County Emergency Management Office. ``You get bitten
by a snake, turn an ankle or take a fall and you're just out there
on your own until somebody happens to come across you.''
   _ Do not leave the trail. Heavy foliage in the mountains
sometimes hides sheer drops. And taking a short-cut on a trail that
winds back and forth on a mountainside can lead to erosion and
other ecological damage.
   _ Don't panic. If you lose your way, stop and think before
taking action. Following a stream downstream will eventually lead
to a road or a place where you can get help. If darkness is
falling, stay where you are for the night. Wandering around in the
darkness can lead to a fall. Wait for daylight and make your way
back to the trail.

   The turkey is too magnificent a bird to be
shot at 100 yards with a rifle, declared James Earl Kennamer.
   ``He's got to be called within shotgun range,'' said Kennamer,
director of research and management for the National Wild Turkey
Federation, a moving force behind the recovery of the wild turkey
in North America.
   He then proceeded to demonstrate, calling two toms and at least
two hens within 55 yards using a box call, slate call and mouth
call. The birds, however, stayed about 15 yards outside the range
of shotguns, loaded with No. 6 shot, and lived to thrill other
hunters with their ear-rattling gobbles.
   A turkey gobbles to tell hens where he is and to call them to
him.
   A turkey hunter calls like a hen, trying to seduce the gobbler
to abandon his waiting and come to her.
   ``Any hunter can learn to use calls,'' Kennamer said. ``The box
call is the easiest to learn and you start with that.''
   ``But calling is overrated. It's important, but you don't have
to be a world class caller to hunt turkeys,'' he said. ``Good
woodsmanship is vital to kill turkeys.''
   The woodsmanship starts with quiet and ends with invisibility.
   ``You've got to be quiet enough to get close enough to birds to
call them without them hearing you, and a turkey's hearing is
acute,'' Kennamer said.
   Camouflage yourself from head to toe, making sure there are no
gaps allowing some white skin on a wrist, a ring or the flash of a
belt buckle to betray you to a turkey.
   ``A turkey can see you blink while he is outside gun range,''
Kennamer said. ``You must not only be camouflaged, you must not
move a muscle while that turkey is in a position where he can see
you.''
   A turkey's head is red, white and blue. As a safety precaution,
Kennamer stressed, don't wear any of those colors when in the woods
during turkey season, because you may become the target for a
careless hunter.
   A hunter's calls are similar to musical instruments, and in the
hands of an expert caller become exactly that.
   The first call is the box call, a rectangular box with a top
which slides across the sides, imitating the yelp, gobble and other
calls.
   ``The box call carries further in the woods than any other
call,'' Kennamer said.
   He has had his current box call 17 years. He occasionally
smooths the underside of the top with very fine sandpaper and
frequently chalks it with soft builders' chalk. When the top slides
across the side of the box, the box resonates, like a violin.
   Next is the slate call, a slab of rock or other hard material
also in box form. The shell of a box turtle makes an excellent
slate call, he said. It is played by rubbing a strike across the
surface. Many strikers today are made of plastic or acrylic.
   Kennamer sands the surface of his slate with ultrafine sandpaper
and draws the striker across the sanded area to imitate the
turkey's putts and purrs.
   Both have a major drawback. They must be worked in the hunter's
hands, and the movement can give away his position to a gobbler.
The bird's vision is many times better than a human's.
   The answer is the mouth call. It's the most difficult to master,
but it can be used without any giveaway movement.
   About the size of a half-dollar with part cut away, the mouth
call is a reed instrument, like a clarinet or saxophone. Pressed
against the roof of the mouth, it is played by forcing air across
its reeds.
   ``Some people have trouble with a gagging reaction'' in keeping
the call in their mouths, Kennamer said. ``But it can be overcome
with a little practice.''
   To carry his gear, Kennamer wears a vest with zipped pouches.
   ``I lost one of my favorite calls when it fell out of a pocket
when I was crossing a stream,'' he said.
   He also has room for a snack, two compasses, snakebite kit, crow
call, owl call, small first-aid kit and some tissues. A cushion
attaches to the bottom of the vest.
   The cushion can be vital to the hunter who has to sit motionless
at the base of a tree for several hours, seducing a turkey.
   Picking the right tree is important, Kennamer stressed.
   ``It's got to be wide enough to cover your silhouette
completely,'' he said. ``Make sure there are no branches or brush
that will move if you bump them with your gun as you line up your
shot. A turkey will see that branch move even if you have stopped.''
   The ideal hunt starts the previous night, tracking a gobbler to
his roost at sunset. Use an owl call to get him to gobble, then
follow the sound.
   Set up within 100 to 150 yards of that tree before dawn. Once
the turkey gobbles and flies down, start making alluring sounds
with your calls.
   If you have to reach for your gun, do it when his head is behind
a tree or other object and he can't see you. Point it at where you
think he will reappear and freeze.
   With No. 6 shot, don't even think of a shot outside 40 yards.
Aim for the head and neck for a clean kill. Aiming for the body
probably will mean a wounded bird that dies later.

   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plans to create the country's
first land refuge for a sea creature.
   It will give loggerhead sea turtles a safe place to nest and for
their young to hatch. The proposed refuge would include segments of
a 20-mile beach at the Brevard-Indian River county line on
Florida's Atlantic Coast.
   About 25 percent of the loggerhead turtles on the East Coast of
the United States nest on that one stretch of beach.
   ``I think we've got one last opportunity to protect the second
most important nesting beach for loggerheads in the world,'' said
Earl E. Possardt, Southeastern sea turtle coordinator for the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, Jacksonville, Fla.
   ``There's some development down there now, but we can make a
difference in the long-term protection of that population. We've
got one last chance.''
   The largest nesting population is in Oman on the Gulf of Hormuz,
center of the world's oil tanker traffic and target of attacks
during the Iran-Iraq war, said Marydele Donelly, director of the
Washington-based Turtle Rescue Fund. Their safety is not assured.
   Loggerhead turtles at one time nested from the Florida Keys to
North Carolina. Those remaining account for 30 percent of the world
population of loggerheads.
   ``We're talking in the range of 10,000 to 12,000 turtles a year,
and we've seen a steady decline in the loggerhead population. In
some areas it's a very dramatic decline, as in South Carolina,''
she said.
   ``This is the last large concentration,'' she said, although
there is a lot of nesting further south in Broward County, Fort
Lauderdale. ``Who's to say what kind of nesting they'd have if they
didn't have a developed beach?''
   The state of Florida plans to create a park in the area,
protecting 4{ miles of beach. Acquisition of the first acreage
could begin this year.
   The federal program has much further to go. The concept has been
approved by former FWS Director Frank Dunkle, but now the service
must prepare an environmental assessment and investigate
alternatives, including land purchases.
   If land purchases are the alternative, the service will begin
seeking money from Congress to buy valuable, high-priced oceanfront
property, with an estimated pricetag of $90 million.
   Four segments of land totaling 9.3 miles of beach and about 500
acres of sand have been identified for protection. The refuge would
be only 100 to 200 yards deep, extending from the mean high water
line to Florida A1A.
   Each year about 10,000 to 12,000 nests are dug in the area. A
few are endangered leatherback turtle nests, and there are several
hundred green turtle nests. The rest are loggerheads.
   There is no record to show how many sea turtles once nested in
the Southeast, ``but we can see trends,'' Possardt said.
   ``South Carolina and Georgia are showing declining trends in
nesting and there's some indication in Florida there's a slight
decline.''
   The refuge, he said, ``would at least provide core areas that
are relatively protected from development ... to assure that the
turtles are protected, too.''

   Greg Marshall wants an alligator's eye view of its world, so
he's working on a camera that alligators, or other types of large
sea dwellers, can haul down into their world to give scientists an
idea of how they live.
   ``We hardly know anything about many animals' underwater
behavior,'' Marshall said. ``Take sea turtles. We know what they do
on the beaches when they nest. We have some ideas from incidental
observations what they do in the nesting areas. But generally we
don't know what these animals actually do, how they interact with
their environment.
   ``It's very basic biology,'' Marshall said.
   He said he got the idea for the camcorder system while working
in Central America and seeing sharks being escorted by ramora fish.
   ``I thought, `wouldn't it be interesting to be dragged along by
a shark all day, just to see what it does,''' he said. So he began
assembling pieces for a system that can be attached to any animal
larger than a juvenile sea turtle.
   There is interest in his project from biologists studying a
variety of animals, from alligators to Antarctic seals.
   ``I think there may be a possibility of applying this method to
studying whales,'' Marshall said.
   His problem is taking off-the-shelf equipment, modifying it,
then building a housing that will protect the camera from the
tremendous water pressure encountered by deep-diving animals.
   ``What I've done is build a custom fiberglass housing, which
I've tested to about 1,000 (pounds pressure per square inch), which
is about 2,000 feet depth,'' he said.
   The other problem is timing.
   The camcorder has a life of about two hours -- the amount of
tape in one cassette.
   One idea is a mercury switch for cameras on sea turtles, which
will leave the camera off until it dives, then switch on to record
what the turtle does while it's on the bottom.
   It may take several weeks to fill the cassette. He plans to
develop a harness that will decay in that time, with the rig
floating to the surface.
   Then a radio will send a signal to scientists to pick it up.
   ``It sees what the eye sees. If you have 6-foot visibility,
that's what it will see,'' Marshall said. ``In terms of visual
impact, it would be much more interesting to be in nice clear
waters, but in terms of biology, it really doesn't matter.
   ``Assuming you're working with an animal that's visually
oriented, which a lot of animals are,'' he said, ``the camera shows
how those animals are behaving in the water, in which they're only
able to see 5 feet or 3 feet, how exactly they are orienting
themselves under those conditions.
   ``Almost any image is going to be interesting.''

   ``The Book'' is out with an emphatic ``yes'' to the question:
``Are there still big ones out there?''
   Nine new world record trophies are among 54 new top-ten listings
in ``Records of North American Big Game,'' published by the Boone
and Crockett Club.
   The records ``underscore the terrific job wildlife management is
doing,'' said William H. Nesbitt, executive director of the Boone
and Crockett Club, founded by President Theodore Roosevelt and a
group of sportsmen in December, 1887.
   ``People are talking about the gene pool deteriorating and other
things. That's hogwash as judged by these trophies. There are big
ones out there, and they are being taken,'' Nesbitt said.
   Its scoring system is accepted for ranking trophies of 31
species of animals, ranging from the walrus to the Canada moose.
   Whitetail deer remains the largest category.
   The book lists 1,274 whitetail deer which meet the club's
standards as a superior trophy. Hunters in the United States killed
about 5 million whitetail deer last season.
   The category also lists the most impressive new trophies.
   ``Both the new record nontypical whitetail and the No. 2 greatly
exceeded the previous world's record,'' an animal killed by Jeff
Benson near Brady, Texas, in 1892. It scored 286 on the B &amp; C scale.
   ``The new world record is 333 7@8, and the No. 2 is 328 2@8.
Both exceeded the previous record by 40 points. That's
phenomenal,'' Nesbitt said in an interview.
   The new record was found in St. Louis County, Mo., in 1981. The
No. 2 trophy, known as the ``hole in the horn buck,'' because there
is a hole in one antler where a bullet passed through, was found in
Portage County, Ohio, in 1940.
   Other new records are for Columbia blacktail deer, Canada moose,
pronghorn, grizzly and cougar. The book also includes three new
species _ Central Canada barren ground caribou, Roosevelt's elk and
Sitka blacktail deer.
   Boone and Crockett scoring is based on antler or horn length for
such animals and skull measurements for others, such as bear and
cougar. Weight is not a factor.
   ``Records of North American Big Game'' is published every six
years. The current edition, published last December, is the ninth
edition.
   This edition is the first to be computer verified.
   ``We did an extensive reverification of all the trophy data that
was in the 1981 records book. We recomputed the scores and checked
for such things as excessive spread penalty,'' Nesbitt said. ``We
ended up with about a 5 percent error rate in the previous book,
and all those were corrected. This is the most accurate, most
authenticated records book ever with the lowest possible margin of
error.''
   Some top-10 trophies were removed from their accustomed places.
   In the 1981 book, some trophies were listed with an asterisk,
meaning they had not been verified by a final judging panel.
   ``We took all the asterisk trophies and took their ranking away
from them and put them at the bottom of the list until they had
been before a judges panel,'' Nesbitt said. ``It freshened up the
top of the list, particularly for the Quebec-Labrador caribou.
People who have followed the book for years are going to miss
seeing some of the trophies there.''
   The book also reflects several minor scoring changes.
   ``The most significant is dropping the so-called double penalty
in the antlered categories where there is an excessive inside
spread, meaning the rack is wider than the length of the longest
antler.''
   Previous rules limited inside spread credit to the length of the
longest antler, then penalized the trophy for the difference. The
new rules drop the penalty.
   The book has a history of trophy measuring, stories about world
records, leaders in American conservation, and the club's Theodore
Roosevelt Memorial Ranch in Montana, where the club is carrying out
research to help ranchers produce both livestock and big game on
their land.
   ``That's important, because most recreational hunting lands are
in private hands today,'' Nesbitt said.
   The book includes instructions on scoring, so any hunter can
compare his best trophy with the world record.
   Illustrated with both black and white and color pictures,
``Records of North American Big Game'' sells for $49.95, plus $2
handling, from the Boone and Crockett Club, 241 South Fraley Blvd.,
Dumfries, Va. 22026.

   Safer travel may be ensured by equipping travel trailers and
other vehicles properly, especially with efficient hitches and
electrical hook-ups.
   ``A quality hitch properly suited for the trailer tongue, weight
and your particular automobile is a necessity,'' says Steve
Cochran, agricultural engineer with the Texas Agricultural
Extension Service.
   ``Universal-type hitches cannot always be adapted to all
automobiles,'' Cochran says. ``Heavy duty shock absorbers or
springs may have to be installed on the car if the trailer tongue
weight exceeds towing specifications. Transmission coolers and
external electric fan cooling devices can be used to supplement
standard engine cooling fans.''
   To compensate for the extra electrical load a trailer adds, he
says, add a heavy duty flasher to the turn signal and emergency
flashers.
   ``Extra wiring presents a need for a quality trailer plug to
make the added electrical load compatible with your car,'' Cochran
says. ``A 6-connector plug allows for tail lignts, left and right
turn signals, stop lights, back-up lights and a ground. If the
trailer has brakes, a 7 or 8 plug is needed.''
   A trailer's added weight and length calls for extra equipment
and safety precautions to ensure a safe trip.
   ``Extra length side mirrors may have to be added to the towing
vehicle for good rear vision,'' Cochran says. ``Wide angle mirrors
used in conjunction with standard mirrors are best for covering
blind spots.''
   In loading a trailer, Cochran suggests placing 60 percent of the
total weight in front of the trailer axle to provide maximum
stability, and adding extra air in the tires to reduce side sway
and overheating.
   The added weight and length of a trailer alters driving
conditions, he says. Passing calls for at least doubling the space
and time normally needed. He cautioned against over-steer when
making lane changes or the trailer will sway or ``whip.''
   Lightly pumping the brakes when stopping can prevent them from
over-heating due to the extra load, Cochran says, adding:
   ``By following these suggestions, your pace will be more
leisurely, the drive smoother and safer, and your family will have
a better chance to enjoy the scenery.''

   Try this for your next college outing: The summit of Chimborazo
in the Ecuadorean Andes, at 20,703 feet the highest peak in North
America.
   A Cornell University group made a successful ascent of
Chimborazo in December as part of the school's outdoor education
program.
   Led by Dan Tillemans, director of Cornell's outdoor education
program, the group's four rope teams climbed the summit in nine
hours, starting from a base camp at 15,000 feet.
   Adjusting to thinning oxygen above 18,000 feet was the most
difficult part, the climbers say.
   ``Some people took one step for every three breaths because
there's so little oxygen up there,'' says Tillemans. `` When we got
there, some people were too tired even to take pictures.''
Tillemans planted a red and white Cornell banner at the summit.
   The group made three ascents during their trip. Ruminahui, at
15,455 feet, was regarded as a ``practice'' climb. It also climbed
Cotapaxi, 19,348 feet, before taking on Chimborazo.
   The climb to Chimborazo began at midnight to take advantage of
calmer conditions, though temperatures dropped to about 20 degrees
at night. During the day, temperatures warmed to about 50 degrees,
and the most serious risk wasn't frostbite but sunburn. The wind
blew fiercely at the summits, the climbers say.
   Tillemans says the Andes views are breathtaking. While climbing
over the Catapaxi glacier at night, he watched lightning storms in
the clouds below him.

   There's the odd flashlight fish, with a sac of luminous bacteria
it uses to signal others in its school or to see food at night.
   Or a fantastic Gorgonian fan coral, resembling a ghostly etching
of a tree under water.
   They're both included in the new ``Visitors' Guide to the Great
Barrier Reef,'' (Reader's Digest).
   The book is a combination travel guide and marine biology study
of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest protected
marine park.
   Sections are devoted to the major types of animals found at the
reef, including its builders, the corals _ which many people still
mistake for plants or rocks. The corals, excreting limestone, have
been at work on the reef for perhaps two million years, making it
the largest structure ever built by animals.
   The book also covers brilliantly colored fishes, bizarre
echinoderms such as sea urchins, turtles, whales, sharks and the
endangered dugongs, or sea cows.
   Those who want to explore any of the 92,000 square miles of
reef, on Australia's northeast coast, will found information about
diving, swimming, boat expeditions , accommodations and the rules
governing the park.
   Divers will find exceptionally clear water for exploring, which
the book describes as ``easy as floating in a bath.'' But they also
will discover they're prohibited from diving on many sunken ships,
which may be protected by the Historic Shipwreck Acts. The book
describes how restricted diving areas are flagged and whether
permits may be required.

   Not all women of a certain age want to
spend their vacations frying on the beach or sightseeing through
the windows of an air-conditioned car.
   Some like more challenge: Riding a packhorse through Yellowstone
or the Grand Canyon, trekking through the Blue Ridge Mountains
(with a llama to carry gear), white water rafting on the Colorado,
riding a horse in Ireland or a camel in Kenya.
   Travel packager Susan Eckert started her Rainbow Adventures with
these women in mind, organizing outings they would be unlikely to
arrange on their own. She limits her tours to women over 30.
   Many women in this age group never have had an opportunity for
this kind of activity, Eckert says. ``They're also reluctant to go
with their families,'' she adds.
   Her firm made a survey of 5,000 over-30 women and discovered
that only one in six wants to travel with family. Half said they
participated in fitness and diet programs, and almost a fourth of
them earn at least $35,000 a year.
   ``This survey reveals that women are no longer happy with the
same old getaway to the beach,'' says Eckert. ``These women want to
participate in their vacations. They don't want to be passive
travelers at their stage in life.''
   Eckert, a photographer and Peace Corps veteran, sensed a good
market that tied in with her own interests when she started her
firm in l982, organizing seven tours.
   This year she's offering 16 packages, ranging from a $239
weekend canoe trip on the Wisconsin River to a $2,495 two-week
cruise of the Greek Islands. She and eight associates _ all women,
most of them with active careers _lead the tours.

   ATHENS, Ga. (AP) _ A complete guide to state fishing records is
now available from an Athens publisher.
   ``Henderson's Guide to Freshwater &amp; Saltwater State Game Fish
Records,'' published by Outdoor Statistical Resources, lists state
records for freshwater fish from all 50 states and saltwater
records from all coastal states except Hawaii, Maine and Oregon,
which keep no such records.
   Rankings are listed for each state by species of fish. The book
also indicates which state records are world records. --_
   One easy way to mess up a fishing trip is to get a hook caught
in an arm, leg or other part of your anatomy.
   There's a relatively simple way to get the hook out without a
trip to the doctor _ all you need is some ice, a bit of relatively
strong fishing line and some antiseptic.
   It will hurt _ but not that badly _ and with after a quick patch
job, you'll be ready to continue fishing.
   Here's how to do it, according to the people at Mercury Marine.
   If the hook is attached to a lure, remove the lure. Then pack
some ice over the wound to both numb the area and reduce bleeding.
   Tie a loop in the fish line and place the loop around the back
of your wrist. Run the loop out to your hand between the thumb and
forefinger.
   Put the other end of the loop over the hook and snug it against
the inside bend. Then use your thumb to apply pressure on the eye
of the hook, down against the skin.
   The pressure both steadies the hook and aligns the barb with the
entry hole. Pushing down on the eye also spreads the wound open and
the barb will come out without tearing as much skin.
   While keeping pressure on the hook, give the line a quick jerk.
The hook should pop out.
   Then rinse the cut in clean water, apply antiseptic and a
bandage, then go back after the big one. --_
   Your casting will be in trouble if you put the line on your reel
poorly. The line could twist and tangle.
   The American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers Association suggests
the following steps to fill a reel.
   Revolving spool, or level-wind, reels:
   Insert a pencil or short stick through the hole in the supply
spool. Have another person hold both ends of the stick and keep a
little pressure on the spool.
   The line should come off the top of the supply spool and in over
the top of the reel. Fill to within one-eighth inch of the lip on
the reel.
   Spinning reels:
   Attach the reel to a rod and string the line from the supply
spool down through the guides. Open the bail and tie the line to
the spool. Then flip the bail closed.
   Have another person hold the rim of the supply spool so it will
spiral off the supply spool in the same coil direction as you want
it to go onto the reel spool.
   This prevents line twist as you wind on the line.
   Holding the rod tip several feet from the supply spool, tense
the line between the thumb and forefinger of your rod-holding hand.
Wind on several turns of line. If the line is coming from the
correct side of the supply spool, it will spiral off in open, loose
coils.
   If not, it soon will begin to twist. If this occurs, turn the
supply spool around. Fill the reel to slightly below the spool lip.
   Closed-faced spincast reels:
   Use the same methods as for open-face reels, except remove the
nosecone and hold it slightly in front of the reel while winding on
the line. That way you can see when the spool is filled to the
proper level, slightly before the spool lip.
   Be sure to properly dispose of your old line. If you throw it
into the water, it can kill fish or other marine life. --_
   Hardwick, Vt. (AP) _ A computer course has been added to the
activities for blind and visually impaired children at Camp
Wapanacki, one of the country's oldest camps devoted to their
interests.
   Campers between the ages of 6 and 21 can learn computer skills
along with swimming, sail boarding, canoeing, rowing, camping, arts
and crafts and the performing arts at the Wapanacki, operated by
the New York Institute for Special Education. The camp also is
offering a special session for blind adults and their families.
   Vicky Tripodi, the camp director, says many of the campers live
in urban areas, so the summer program offers them a chance to get
outdoors and exercise. The activities also let them learn new
skills to help them cope at home, she says. --=
   If you want a boat for fishing or water sports but don't have
much storage space in your small house or apartment, a collapsible
boat may be the answer.
   Made by Porta-Bote International of Moutain View, Calif., a new
series of boats features models that fold to a thickness of 4''.
One can be strapped to the top of your car like a surfboard.
   The boats come in 8', 10' and 12' models and weigh about half as
much as comparable aluminum boats. --=
   Oxygen-based chemicals offer an alternative to chlorine for
treating swimming pool water, according to Du Pont, which makes
oxidizers for use in new pool shocking systems.
   The systems can be a boon to chlorine-sensitive swimmers, their
hair and their swimwear, Du Pont says. Water can be treated in 15
minutes without danger of underuse or overuse. The company says the
oxidizing systems also work in pools sanitized with bromine,
destroy organic contaminants and help prevent formation of combined
chlorine, or chloramines. --=

<HEAD>Minorco Raises Offer for Consolidated Gold Fields</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African-backed Minorco SA today sweetened to
$6.02 billion its takeover bid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC in
a final attempt to win control of Britain's largest mining company.
   Minorco increased its offer by raising the cash portion of the
bid for a total of $26.35 a share, up from the previous offer of
$23.80 per share, or a total of $5.4 billion. Minorco first offered
$5.1 billion last fall.
   Minorco, which owns 29.6 percent of Consolidated Gold Fields, is
hoping to meet an April 26 deadline set by British regulators for
gaining more than 50 percent control.
   The company received British regulatory clearance in February
allowing it to proceed with the takeover battle it originally
launched in September.
   The offer, however, still depends on Minorco winning its appeal
against a U.S. court injunction blocking Minorco from acquiring
more than 30 percent of Consolidated Gold Fields' shares.
   The Minorco bid is the largest for a British company, topping
Nestle SA's $4.6 billion purchase of British confectioner Rowntree
PLC last year.
   Based in Luxembourg, Minorco is 60 percent-owned by the
Oppenheimers' Anglo American Corp. gold mining giant and the
diamond mining group De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. of South
Africa.

   Gulf &amp; Western Inc. says it will sell its
financial-services operations and change its name as it completes
its transformation from a diverse conglomerate to an entertainment
and publishing company.
   The company, the parent of Paramount Pictures, said Sunday it
would change its name to Paramount Communications Inc. after
selling The Associates, its consumer and commercial financial unit.
   Wall Street applauded the move today. Gulf &amp; Western jumped
$3.25 to $52.75 a share in active mid-morning trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   ``The sale of The Associates represents another phase in our
strategic development,'' said Martin S. Davis, Gulf &amp; Western's
chairman and chief executive.
   ``We have concluded that the current market dynamics and the
financial and regulatory restraints inherent in our
consumer-commercial finance business are incompatible with those of
our entertainment and publishing operations,'' he said in a
statement.
   Proceeds from the sale would be used to expand the entertainment
and publishing operations through product development and through
acquisitions, the company said.
   In addition, the company said it would continue a program to buy
back Gulf &amp; Western stock on the open market or through tender
offers.
   Gulf &amp; Western spokesman Jerry Sherman declined to state what
acquisitions may be of interest to the New York-based company. He
also would not say what price the company expected to fetch for the
financial services division.
   Company directors approved the restructuring Friday, he said.
   Financial analyst Mark Manson of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Inc. said he believed the restructuring was a good move and that it
would boost the company's stock price.
   ``Paramount has been the leading film company for most of the
last decade,'' he said. ``They're a leader in the educational
publishing area as well. So I think they can expand their already
very strong positions in those areas.''
   He said the stock market has been unwilling to recognize what he
believes is the true worth of The Associates as reflected in Gulf &amp;
Western's share prices.
   But, Manson said, the company is taking a risk in running what
essentially is a public auction for the division. ``They are
assuming there will be a buyer or buyers out there that will
recognize the value they are seeking,'' he said.
   Manson placed the value of The Associates as in excess of $3.2
billion.
   The company has retained the New York investment banking firm
Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to find a buyer for the division, formally
called the Associates First Capital Corp., Sherman said.
   The Associates has 520 retail branch offices in 42 states and
Puerto Rico, through which it offers mortgages, retail loans and
other personal financing. It also has 95 offices in Japan and 45 in
the United Kingdom.
   The commercial division of The Associates, with 75 offices in
the United States and Canada, is a leading source of financing for
the trucking industry, Sherman said.
   The Associates also operates a bank in California, Associates
National Bank, whose sole business is issuing credit cards, he said.
   The financial division had operating income of $372.4 million on
revenue of $2.05 billion in the fiscal year ended Oct. 31, 1988,
Sherman said.
   The net receivable base of The Associates has grown from $4.5
billion in 1982 to $11.2 billion, the company said. Its assets
exceed $13 billion. It has had a record profit the past 12 years.
   Gulf &amp; Western's publishing and entertainment operations had an
operating profit of $431.8 million on revenue of $3.06 billion in
the fiscal year, the company said.
   Combined, the company reported a net profit of $384.7 million on
revenue of $5.11 billion in the fiscal year.
   In addition to Paramount's movie, television and home-video
interests, the company's operations include book publishers
Prentice Hall, Pocket Books, and Simon and Schuster; the Canadian
theater chain Famous Players; Madison Square Garden and its cable
TV network; the New York Knicks basketball team and the New York
Rangers hockey team.
   The divestment of the financial services arm would cap a
restructuring begun six years ago that has seen the sale of
divisions with combined revenue of more than $4 billion.
   The units were involved in areas as diverse as manufacturing,
building products, natural resources, cigars, sugar growing,
automotive parts, apparel, bedding and home furnishings.

   The number of working oil and gas rigs declined
this week by one to total 778, halting a two-week surge in the
number of active rigs, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   Over the previous two weeks the rig count had increased by 39
following a lengthy downward trend. A year ago, the total was 916,
Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for
oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing
oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Pennsylvania showed the
biggest decline with seven fewer rigs, followed by Texas, five;
Michigan, four; and North Dakota, two.
   Oklahoma showed the largest gain with eight additional rigs,
followed by Kansas, three; Louisiana and Ohio, two each; and
California and Colorado; one each. New Mexico and Wyoming were
unchanged from the previous week.

<HEAD>Ford Names Gilmour To New Position</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allan Gilmour, Ford Motor Co.'s executive
vice president for international operations, Monday was named
executive vice president in charge of corporate staffs and a member
of the company's office of the chief executive.
   Gilmour, seen as likely to eventually step into the driver's
seat of the nation's No. 2 automaker, will be succeeded by Louis R.
Ross as executive vice president for international automotive
operations, Ford said.
   Alexander J. Trotman, former chairman of Ford of Europe, will
move into Ross's post as executive vice president for North
American automotive operations.
   The appointments are effective May 1, Ford Chairman Donald E.
Petersen said.
   Gilmour, 54, joined Ford in 1960 as a financial analyst. From
1968-72 he was a special assistant to J. Edward Lundy, Ford's
executive vice president for finance.
   In 1975, Gilmour was named president of Ford Motor Credit Co.,
the company's consumer financing arm, and four years later, he was
elected vice president and controller.
   Gilmour became vice president for external and personnel affairs
in 1984, and executive vice president and chief financial officer
in 1986. He took over the company's international operations in
October 1987.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early activity today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   With demand weak and enough moisture in both the western
cornbelt and the southwestern wheat growing areas, traders expected
prices to settle in slightly lower ranges and stay there most of
the day.
   But some support came from talk of possible buys by the Soviet
Union and a strong cash market also underpinned prices.
   Soybeans, meanwhile, got some backing from reports that the
harvest in Brazil was being delayed by too much rain.
   Wheat was 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in May at $3.93{ cents a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1\

<TEXT>
   NEC Corp. today announced the world's fastest
supercomputer, a machine that can carry out more than 20 billion
operations per second and spells trouble for the American lead in
supercomputers.
   NEC's SX-X series will be so much faster than American-made
machines that U.S. commercial and government customers may feel
they have no choice but to buy the Japanese machine, said George
Lindamood, an analyst at the Gartner Group consulting firm in
Stamford, Conn.
   ``I imagine there will be some fairly severe government
wrangling in Washington as a result of this one,'' Lindamood said.
   The SX-X Series will go on sale in the July-September period of
1990, NEC said. That is about the same time Cray Research Inc., the
Minneapolis-based world leader in supercomputers, begins delivery
of its Cray 3 models.
   NEC said the SX-X series can attain peak vector speeds of 20
billion floating-point operations per second. Floating-point
operations are high-precision calculations on rows and columns of
numbers.
   In contrast, the Cray 3 is expected to perform up to 16 billion
operations per second, Lindamood said.
   The computers are being sold in North America by HNSX
Supercomputers Inc., a Burlington, Mass.-based marketing company
jointly owned by NEC and Honeywell Inc. They will range in price
from $5 million to $23 million and will use a version of the Unix
base layer of software.
   Cray Research did not immediately return a phone call seeking
comment on the NEC chip.
   The other major U.S. supercomputer maker is Control Data Corp.'s
ETA Systems Inc. In Japan, competitors include Hitachi Ltd. and
Fujitsu Ltd.
   NEC has a big advantage in supercomputers because it is the
world's largest semiconductor manufacturer and can make its own
high-speed logic chips. In contrast, Cray relies on Japan's Fujitsu
for the central logic chips in its Cray Y-MP line. The central
logic chips for its Cray 3 line will come from a small company,
GigaBit Logic Inc. of Newbury Park, Calif., Lindamood said.

   Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald Petersen was
awarded $10.5 million for 1988, including $7.2 million in stock
options, making him the leader in auto executive compensation so
far, the company said today.
   The nation's No. 2 automaker said in its proxy statement mailed
to shareholders Petersen received $3.3 million in salary and
supplemental compensation, including bonuses and company
contributions to savings and stock investment plans.
   Ford President Harold Poling received $4.1 million _ $2.6
million in salary and supplemental compensation and $1.5 million in
exercised stock options.
   Ford, the nation's most profitable automaker with earnings of
$5.3 billion last year, said its board of directors' compensation
committee limited the total compensation for eligible officers to
$250 million. The compensation plan permitted distribution of
$375.1 million.
   The difference, $125.1 million, will become part of the
company's general fund.
   The United Auto Workers, which has been harshly critical of big
executive salaries, bonuses and stock options, did not immediately
comment on Ford's announcement.
   Three other Ford officers listed in the proxy statement, along
with their salaries, supplemental compensation payments and stock
options exercised, were: L.R. Ross, the executive vice president
for North American automotive operations who was named Monday as
executive vice president for international automotive operations,
$3.5 million; Philip Benton, executive vice president and president
of the Ford Automotive Group, $3 million; and Allan Gilmour, who
Monday was appointed executive vice president for corporate staffs,
$1.7 million.
   Gilmour, who also was named to the office of the chief
executive, is the odds-on choice to become chairman when Petersen
reaches Ford's mandatory retirement age of 65 in the fall of 1991.
   Ford's supplemental compensation payments could be deferred into
common stock purchase or other programs. Otherwise, the awards
would be paid in two lump sums, one last month and the other in
January 1990.
   On Friday, Chrysler Corp. issued its proxy statement, saying
Chairman Lee Iacocca had received $3.7 million in cash, bonuses and
other compensation for 1988. No. 1 General Motors Corp. is expected
to issue its proxy statement within a week.

   Rolls-Royce PLC said Monday it will acquire
Northern Engineering Industries PLC in a deal that values the
British maker of electrical generating equipment at 306 million
pounds, or about $520 million.
   The jet engines manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which already holds a
4.7 percent stake in the manufacturer, said the stock swap values
NEI at 128 pence, or $2.18 dollars, a share.
   Rolls-Royce said it will offer seven new shares for every 10 NEI
shares.
   Rolls-Royce called off discussions with NEI last year on the
possibility of a merger. At the time, Rolls-Royce said the boards
of the two companies ``have not been able to agree to terms on
which to establish further relationships.''
   The offer represents a 23 percent premium over the price of NEI
shares on last Oct. 28, the day before Rolls-Royce took its stake
in NEI, the company said.
   Rolls-Royce said it expects the merger to lead to benefits in
research and development, overseas representation, financing and
the provision of gas turbine-operated small power stations.

<TEXT>
   Unions at Eastern Airlines and a management
group headed by former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth have
reached tentative agreements that would remove a major obstacle to
the sale of the strikebound carrier, a labor source said today.
   The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a
formal announcement would be made later today before U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in New York. Lifland must approve
any sale of the airline.
   Lifland began a closed meeting with the principals at mid-day in
bankruptcy court but there was no immediate word on the progress of
the talks, which have been held under a news blackout.
   Ueberroth and his group have been seeking more than $200 million
in concessions from three unions and Eastern's non-contract
employees, but there was no immediate word on what, if any,
givebacks were contained in the tentative accords.
   The source declined to discuss the agreements further.
   The tentative agreement followed a weekend of secret talks in
Washington between the unions and representatives of Ueberroth, who
last week reached agreement to buy Eastern from Texas Air Corp. for
$464 million. Ueberroth could have called off the deal if
agreements were not reached with the unions by midnight Tuesday.
   Ueberroth has said he will go ahead with plans to sell the
lucrative Eastern Shuttle to New York developer Donald Trump for
$365 million.
   The unions involved are the International Association of
Machinists, the Air Line Pilots Association and the Transport
Workers Union.
   The IAM struck Eastern on March 4 after refusing to accept more
than $120 million in wage and other concessions demanded by Texas
Air, Eastern's parent company. The other unions have accepted
concessions in the past, but honored IAM's picket lines.
   The unions brought Eastern operations to a virtual halt, and the
airline filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws March 9,
five days after the walkout began.
   Eastern since the strike has been seeking court orders requiring
the pilots to return to work. A federal district judge in Miami was
scheduled to issue a ruling on the request today, but his office
said the judge had granted a request from Eastern and the pilots
union that he not issue the decision today.
   The weekend talks were held under the guidance of attorney David
Shapiro, who is serving as court-appointed examiner of the airline
under an order issued by the bankruptcy court.
   While union officials said they believed they could come to
terms with the Ueberroth group, they expressed concerns about its
plans for the carrier.
   Union officials also questioned statements by Texas Air Chairman
Frank Lorenzo that Eastern could be operating within 24 hours of
completion of the sale to Ueberroth.
   Eastern has been flying a skeleton schedule since the IAM
walkout.
   Officials from two of the unions, noting that the majority of
Eastern's planes have been grounded for more than a month, said it
would take some time to inspect them.
   They also said it would be foolish and costly to restore a full
schedule immediately because Eastern, already carrying a heavy
debt, would have few passengers in the days immediately following
resumption of service.
   In a related matter, Texas Air said it filed suit Friday against
Trans World Airlines Inc., charging that the rival carrier and its
owner, takeover expert Carl Icahn, had interfered illegally in the
talks between Ueberroth and the unions.
   TWA and Icahn responded in a statement Sunday that the suit was
``frivolous.''
   ``The contacts I had with Eastern unions were initiated by their
request that I become involved,'' Icahn said. ``I did not realize
that I needed permission from (Texas Air Chairman) Frank Lorenzo to
take phone calls from people I consider my friends.''
   Icahn also said he did not make any competing offer to the
unions or a creditors committee, which must approve any sale of the
airline, and that he would not do so unless Ueberroth's offer falls
through.

<HEAD>The High Cost of Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you're looking for signs of inflation, which
these days is a popular participant sport, you might not easily
find it in wage increases _but you'll score if you look under
``benefits.''
   Because benefits are as much a cost of doing business as wages
and salaries, the inflationary pressure, or pressure on producer
and consumer prices, is much the same. And the costs of some of
those benefits are indeed rising.
   However, tending to obscure the benefits rise is the public
display in many areas of rising wages at fast-food restaurants,
shopping malls and supermarkets which, others things being equal,
will show up in higher prices.
   In a city near here, for example, a roadside supermarket sign
once reserved for sales and specials advertises ``Hiring Now. $7 An
Hour,'' a rate more than double the minimum wage. At some nearby
restaurants, the signboards and table mats may carry help-wanted
messages rather than the usual menu items.
   But the statistics tell a different story _ that average weekly
earnings of $328.86 in March, while $1.64 higher than in February,
were still below the January level of $329.13, hardly an
inflationary trend.
   Getting less attention are benefits, which soared last year and
remain a source of worry for employers. Many are seeking to reduce
the load, a turnabout from the practice of the previous decade,
when benefits were added lavishly.
   The cost to business of benefits last year jumped 6.8 percent,
almost double the 3.5 percent rate of increase in 1987, according
to Labor Department figures. A good deal of that increase resulted
from ever-increasing health care items and a Social Security rise.
   The Social Security tax increase for employers, which brought
the rate to 7.51 percent from 7.15 percent of payroll in 1987,
won't be duplicated this year and so is at least temporarily
removed as an inflationary factor.
   However, inflation in the general health care category remains a
factor in business costs, resisting the hold-down efforts of a
growing number of employers, large and small. While other
categories were brought under control in recent years, health care
has persistently, defiantly gone its own way.
   The pay rise last year was much less than for benefits,
increasing 4.1 percent, or not even as much as the consumer price
index. Still, it was much faster than the 3.3 percent gain of 1987.
   The question now is whether private business can absorb the
increases or will be forced to pass them on through the chain of
producers, manufacturers and distributors, relentlessly and
eventually reaching the consumer.
   On the plus side, some manufacturers have greatly improved their
efficiency in the past decade. Whether such efficiencies can help
them hold the line in the face of reduced sales and rising costs is
another matter.
   On the minus side, unemployment is now down to 5 percent of all
civilian workers and well under that for adult men and women.
That's a 15-year low, suggesting the labor pool is being drained of
productive workers.
   By using less efficient workers, and untrained workers who may
require extensive instruction, business will be under a strain to
hold prices. But an even bigger strain might be in containing
benefits costs.

<HEAD>Net Income Down From Year Ago, But Operating Net Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. said Monday its first-quarter profit
skidded from a year earlier, when results were swelled by a huge
gain on the sale of its records division, but said improvement at
its television network helped boost income from continuing
operations by 26 percent.
   The broadcasting giant said its net income fell to $56.1
million, or $2.18 a share, in the three months ended March 31 from
$911.3 million, or $35.34 a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 5 percent to $731.2 million from
$696.6 million a year earlier.
   The 1988 results were fattened by an after-tax gain of $866.6
million on the sale of CBS Records to Sony Corp.
   CBS said its income from continuing operations rose to a record
$56.3 million from $44.8 million a year earlier.
   Laurence A. Tisch, president and chief executive, said the
operating reuslts reflected a profit of undisclosed size at the CBS
Television Network in contrast with a ``minor loss'' a year earlier.
   He said the network had improved results in several key time
periods including primetime, sports and news.
   The miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' was broadcast during the
quarter and achieved the highest ratings for that type of program
in five years.
   The company said its interest income fell to $39.4 million from
$51.5 million in the same period a year earlier, which included a
pre-tax gain of $14 million on the sale of Treasury securities.
   The decline was also attributed to lower balances of cash and
securities due to tax payments on the CBS Records sale and
acquisitions of a television station in Miami and two radio
stations in Detroit.

<HEAD>Minorco Increases Offer for Consolidated Gold Fields</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minorco SA, the investment arm of a South African
gold and diamond empire, on Monday made a last-ditch $6.02 billion
offer for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC.
   Minorco increased its offer by raising the cash portion of the
bid for a total of $26.35 a share, up from the previous offer of
$23.80 per share, or a total of $5.4 billion. Minorco first offered
$5.1 billion last fall.
   Minorco said the offer was a final attempt to gain control of
Britain's largest mining company. If successful, the takeover would
be the largest ever of a British company.
   ``Our offer ... is our final word and represents a full premium
for control,'' Minorco Chief Executive Michael Edwardes said.
``Nobody will pay more.''
   British regulators have set an April 26 deadline for Minorco's
attempt to capture more than 50 percent of Consolidated Gold
Fields. Minorco, a mining investment concern, currently owns 29.6
percent of Gold Fields.
   The offer still depends on Minorco winning its appeal of an
injunction issued in U.S. District Court in Manhattan blocking
Minorco from acquiring more than 30 percent of Consolidated Gold
Fields' shares.
   The shares, which closed at $23.71 Friday, jumped to $25.07
early Monday before Minorco announced its revised offer, then fell
back to $24.02.
   Based in Luxembourg, Minorco is 60 percent-owned by the
Oppenheimer family's Anglo American Corp. gold mining giant and the
diamond mining group De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd.
   Minorco's original $5.1 billion hostile bid last September
automatically lapsed when it was referred to Britain's Monopolies
and Mergers Commission. The commission cleared the proposed
acquisition in February, prompting the renewed bids.
   In a novel defense against Minorco, Consolidated Gold Fields has
promised to pay its shareholders $2.2 billion in dividends if it
does not meet its own profit forecast. The company has guaranteed
shareholders more than 20 percent average annual compound growth in
earnings per share over the next three years.
   If its target of $6.80 in cumulative earnings per share is not
reached by the end of the 1992 fiscal year, then shareholders will
get a special cash dividend of $10.20 a share, it said.

<HEAD>Japanese Tape-Maker TDK to Buy Silicon Systems Inc. for $200 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUSTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Silicon Systems Inc. has agreed to be
bought by Japanese recording tape company TDK Corp. in a deal that
values the computer chip maker at $200 million.
   The Orange County company makes integrated circuits for use in
computer hard-disk memory systems and in modems, the devices that
allow computers to communicate with each other over phone lines.
   TDK has agreed to pay $20 a share, or a total of about $200
million, for Silicon Systems stock, the companies announced Monday.
Once the Japanese company has acquired a majority of the stock
through a tender offer to shareholders, the companies will be
merged.
   Silicon Systems management and workforce will be retained, said
Ken Aoshima, a vice president of TDK USA, the company's U.S.
marketing arm.
   The California company, with 950 employees in the United States
and 450 in Singapore, reported a profit of $12.7 million on sales
of $120.8 million in 1988.
   The deal should not be portrayed as a Japanese acquisition of
American technology, the company's president, Carmelo Santoro, has
said.
   Santoro told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published
Monday that his company doesn't develop technology, but rather
makes and markets components based on existing knowledge.
   TDK is best known to consumers as a maker of audio and video
tapes and computer disks, though 65 percent of its business is in
manufacture of components for electronic gear.
   TDK, publicly traded in Japan, had sales of $3.4 billion in its
latest fiscal year.

<HEAD>SEC Announces Action Against Former Merrill Lynch Trader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Merrill Lynch mortgage trader whose
allegedly unauthorized transactions resulted in heavy trading
losses for the firm will face a hearing on fraud charges, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday.
   The SEC charged that Howard A. Rubin, the former head
mortgage-backed securities trader at Merrill Lynch Government
Securities, willfully violated federal antifraud laws in connection
with trades in April 1987.
   ``A hearing will be scheduled to determine whether the
allegations against Rubin are true, and if so, to decide what
remedial action, if any, is appropriate,'' Edwin H. Nordlinger,
deputy regional administrator of the SEC's New York office, said in
a statement.
   If Rubin is found guilty, he faces sanctions from temporary
suspension from securities trading to limited trading activities to
a lifetime ban from the business.
   Rubin currently works as a mortgage securities trader at Bear
Stearns &amp; Co., a spokeswoman for the securities firm said.
   An attorney representing Rubin, Ira Lee Sorkin, said Rubin
denies he committed any fraud.
   ``He has had an outstanding reputation in the industry and an
unblemished record,'' Sorkin said. ``And we intend to litigate this
matter to the hilt.''
   Sorkin said the SEC's action appears based entirely on an
allegation that Rubin did not follow his supervisors' instructions.
   ``How the SEC regards this as a violation of the federal
securities laws is beyond our imagination,'' he said.
   Allegedly unauthorized transactions by Rubin while he was at
Merrill Lynch were blamed by the company as a major reason for huge
trading losses that cut the investment firm's pre-tax earnings by
about $275 million in the second quarter of 1987.
   The transactions involved hundreds of millions of dollars of
certain types of mortgage-backed securities, which represent
mortgages that are pooled and then packaged as marketable
securities for sale to investors.
   Merrill Lynch's losses, at the time considered one of the
largest trading setbacks in Wall Street history, were linked to
unauthorized trading in a particularly risky form of
mortgage-backed securities in which the interest and principal
portions of the securities are traded separately.
   As a result of the huge loss, the giant brokerage firm
reorganized its mortgage securities division and ousted the
executives in charge of the operation. Rubin also was fired.
   The SEC said in its order instituting administrative proceedings
against Rubin that he acted against the instructions of his
superiors in buying and selling the securities.
   He also failed to properly record his trades in Merrill Lynch
books, the SEC said.
   An as-yet unscheduled hearing would be held before an SEC judge,
the agency said.

<HEAD>Dow Jones Posts Big Rise in 1st-Qtr Profit with One-Time Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. said Monday its profit nearly
doubled from a year ago because of a big one-time gain from the
sale of a cable television investment, but weakness in financial
advertising drove its operating income down by 12.5 percent.
   Dow Jones said its profit rose to $200 million, or $1.99 a
share, in the first three months of the year from $103.6 million,
or $1.08 per share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 3.6 percent to $406.8 million from
$392.5 million a year earlier.
   The latest results included an after-tax gain of $164.1 million
from the sale in January of the company's 17 percent stake in
Continental Cablevision Inc., a cable system operator. The 1988
results included a gain of $64.4 million from the sale of a
book-publishing subsidiary, Richard D. Irwin Inc.
   Excluding those one-time gains, DowJones said its earnings fell
8.4 percent to $35.9 million from $39.2 million a year earlier.
   Dow Jones said its operating income, or earnings before taxes,
interest and other income, fell 12.5 percent to $79.8 million from
$91.1 million.
   The decline was blamed mainly on continuing weakness in
financial advertising at the Wall Street Journal, its flagship
publication.
   Revenue at the business publications segment fell 4.8 percent to
$182.9 million and operating income fell 33.1 percent to $21.8
million, the company said.
   That segment includes results from the Wall Street Journal,
Barron's, the Far Eastern Economic Review and other publications.
   Dow Jones said its information services segment had a 14.5
percent increase in revenue to $169.1 million while operating
income rose 0.6 percent to $54.6 million. That includes results
from Telerate Inc., in which Dow Jones owns a 67 percent stake.
   Excluding Telerate's results, Dow Jones said the information
services group consisting of Dow Jones News Service, Dow Jones-News
Retrieval and other newswire and electronic services, reported a
7.6 percent rise in revenue and a 6.1 pecent increase in operating
income.
   Ottaway Newspapers Inc., the community newspapers segment of Dow
Jones, had operating income of $7.4 million, down 13.6 percent, and
revenue of $54.8 million, up 3.9 percent.

<HEAD>Crystal Company Reports Worse-Than-Expected Financial Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Waterford Glass Group PLC, Ireland's
well-know but financially troubled crystal company, reported Monday
that it made a small profit in 1988 compared to a loss in the
previous year.
   However, the company called last year's earnings of $430,000,
vs. a $85.37 million loss in 1987, ``significantly worse than
expected.''
   Sales rose to $435.29 million from $403.97 million.
   Waterford had been optimistic about its 1988 figures until it
hired accountants Peat Marwick McLintock in January to conduct an
independent review of its financial performance.
   The accounting firm discovered serious accounting errors, and
shortly after Waterford Chairman Paddy Hayes resigned. He is being
replaced by Paddy Byrne, chairman and chief executive of
Waterford's Wedgwood division.
   The accountants found that Waterford's internal review had
overstated last year's profits by $21.45 million largely through
overvaluation of inventories.
   In recent years, Waterford, one of Ireland's best known
manufacturers and one of the country's largest employers, has
suffered huge losses and laid off one-third of the 3,000 employees
in its crystal division.
   Half of Waterford's crystal is exported directly to the United
States and another 35 percent is bought by Americans traveling
abroad.

<HEAD>New Korean Airline Orders $1 Billion In Boeing Planes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new South Korean airline with plans for
service to Europe and North America on Monday announced a deal
worth about $1 billion to buy nine Boeing Co. jetliners and take
options on seven more.
   Including the new agreement with fledgling Asiana Airlines,
Seattle-based Boeing has announced orders for 110 jetliners worth
$8.7 billion so far this year.
   Asiana, based in Seoul, South Korea, began operations within
that country on Dec. 23. It said it will use its new jets to expand
to other Asian markets and eventually to North America and Europe.
   Asiana ordered five 737-400s and took options for another five.
It also signed letters of intent to order two 747-400 jumbo jets
and take options for two more, and to convert two previous options
for widebody 767-300s to firm orders.
   A 747-400, the world's largest passenger jet, sells for $116
million to $136 million a copy, depending on configuration and
equipment, Boeing said. The smaller 737-400 twin-jet sells for $31
million to $36 million, while a widebody 767-300 goes for $66
million to $73 million.
   ``In the short term, we could have saved a few dollars by buying
or leasing older planes,'' S.Y. Park, chairman of Kumho Business
Group, Asiana's parent company, said at a news conference.
   ``However, a new airline has enough problems establishing its
market base without the burden of heavy maintenance
responsibilities and the uncertainty of whether older planes will
perform reliably,'' he said.
   Park said other aircraft manufacturers had talked about selling
planes to Asiana, ``but at first, others didn't take us seriously.
Boeing did take us seriously.''
   J.F. Chorlton, a Boeing vice president, said Asiana had
indicated an interest in Boeing aircraft as early as a year ago. He
said Boeing had made room on its production line for the planes
before the order was announced.
   Asiana began its Korean service with six 737-400s leased from
GPA Group Ltd.
   Deliveries of Asiana's new planes will begin in July 1992 and
continue through June 1993. Asiana will get the two 767-300s
ordered earlier in 1990, Boeing said.
   Boeing normally doesn't announce letters of intent, said Boeing
Commercial Airplanes spokesman Randy Harrison, but Asiana had made
it clear it intended to buy the planes.
   Harrison said a letter of intent is just short of an order, but
no money is paid to begin construction.

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
session dominated by takeover news and speculation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 5.31 to 2,299.49
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 658 up, 695 down and 582
unchanged.
   Most analysts in the financial world believe economic growth has
begun to slow since the early weeks of the year.
   But hopes persisted among traders that that wouldn't stop most
companies from posting healthy earnings gains for the January-March
quarter.
   At the same time, market participants were looking ahead a bit
warily to the monthly report on the producer price index, due from
the government on Friday.
   Advance estimates call for the index, which serves as a gauge of
inflationary pressures in the economy, to show a smaller rise than

   Grain futures prices closed mixed, but soybeans
were mostly higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Both markets opened under slight pressure as a result of weak
demand and weekend rain or snowfall in both the western cornbelt
and the southwest wheat growing areas.
   Following last week's losses, soybeans skidded to an 11-month
low, only to make a quick runup on ideas the market may have been
oversold.
   Although commission houses and local traders continued buying,
the large commercial houses blunted the rally by staying on the
selling side of the equation and soybeans closed off the high for
the day.
   Both old-crop wheat and corn were higher on short-covering, but
contracts for the deferred months remained lower.

<TEXT>
   The federal Export-Import Bank on Monday
announced an agreement with a French bank to push loans for the
sale of American products in 18 African countries, 12 of them
former French colonies.
   The Export-Import Bank said in a statement that the deal with
Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique Occidentale (BIAO-Afribank)
would help U.S. exporters penetrate markets traditionally dominated
by European exporters.
   BIAO-Afribank began more than 130 years ago as the bank of issue
in Senegal, said Mario Varela, general manager of the bank's New
York office. Now private, the bank has headquarters in Paris and
offices in former British colonies, including Nigeria and Zimbabwe.
   The Export-Import bank makes loans to encourage purchases of
U.S. exports, especially in Third World countries.
   Varela said the agreement has been in effect since December and
a loan to Burkina Faso, formerly Upper Volta, is being negotiated.
   The statement did not mention France as a specific target of
competition.
   It said if there is evidence of foreign competition,
BIAO-Afribank can lend U.S. dollars from the Export-Import Bank at
internationally agreed rates of interest. It also can use a U.S.
guarantee program to cover loans in French francs as well as those
in dollars.
   Loans must be for U.S. exports of $200,001 or more. No upper
limit was named.

the 1988 buyout of the aerospace and defense company.
   A purchase agreement was completed during the weekend, Henley

   Henley has had operating responsibility for PA Holdings since it
teamed with Wasserstein Perella, a New York investment firm, to buy
the company from Whitman Corp. in a $1.2 billion leveraged buyout
last August.
   In a leveraged buyout, a company is bought with mostly borrowed
funds, which are then repaid from the firm's cash flow or the sale
of its assets.
   Henley and Wasserstein Perella contributed a total of $100
million to the buyout.
   PA Holdings designs and makes aircraft flight-control actuation

<TEXT>
   The slick of thick crude oil spilled by
the Exxon Valdez stalled Monday in its movement toward the nation's
No. 1 fishing port and was breaking up in rough waves and high
wind, the Coast Guard said.
   However, the stormy weather hampered cleanup efforts as small
craft advisories and gale warnings were posted along the central
Alaskan coast, where 10.1 million gallons of crude oil oozed across
Prince William Sound, threatening fisheries and killing thousands
of birds and animals.
   The wind was out of the northeast, which kept oil from washing
ashore in untainted inlets and the Kenai Fjords National Park.
   ``It's not pushing it (oil) to the Kenai Peninsula, and that's
good. The weather is breaking up the slick, and that's good,'' said
Coast Guard spokesman Rick Meidt.
   Exxon said Monday it planned to repay the government for the
military's expenses, but noted its expenses would also be deducted
from its income taxes.
   ``We're anticipating the costs incurred by the government at all
levels will be eventually reimbursed by Exxon,'' said Don Cornett,
the company's top Alaska executive. ``In the normal course of
things, cost of doing business is deducted from your income tax and
that is how it is expressed to customers.''
   As of Monday, 18,000 barrels of crude have been recovered, or 8
percent of the 240,000 barrels spilled. Exxon said with additional
skimmers about 2,000 barrels were being recovered a day, although
reports from state officials and the Coast Guard so far have placed
the figure at about 1,000 barrels a day.
   At the fishing port of Kodiak, which landed a $166 million catch
last year to lead the nation, preparations to battle the floating
oil continued in spite of the good news. Fishermen covered logs
with fish net and strung them together as floating booms to keep
oil out of vital areas. Town leaders even broadcast boom-making
techniques on local television.
   Oil was still at least 60 miles from Kodiak's fishing areas, and
appeared to have stalled on its southwesterly drift toward the
town, Meidt said.
   ``The leading edge has retreated a little bit,'' and oil was
beginning to break into tar balls and sink, said Bill Lamoreaux,
the state's on-scene coordinator. ``That's good news.''
   There was some concern that, as the storm systems generating
Monday's turbulence move closer to land, higher waves in the sound
could wash oil over containment booms protecting spawning areas and
other protected spots.
   ``If the storm is a severe one, we'll see some more beaches
impacted,'' state cleanup coordinator Jim Hayden.
   Still, Hayden said the fisheries were well-defended and boats
were being moved from fish-rich Sawmill Bay to other heavily oiled
areas.
   ``Some of the operations are shifting away from the protective
actions at the fisheries to some oil cleanup,'' he said.
   Spotter flights over the spill were canceled Monday but the
weather was not expected to curtail boom-laying operations.
   The Coast Guard sent six additional cutters Monday from West
Coast ports to assist in the cleanup effort. On Sunday, military
cargo jets flew oil skimmers, booms and beach landing craft into
Alaska, and commanders issued a Pacific-wide call for more
equipment to fight the nation's worst oil spill.
   Repairs were under way on the tanker Exxon Valdez, which spilled
the oil 25 miles from Valdez when it ran aground and ripped its
hull on a reef well outside the normal shipping channel. Salvage
workers have reinforced punctured areas of the tanker to prevent
further fractures, Meidt said.
   The state said the tanker, anchored in a remote cove for the
repairs, continues to leak oil, which escapes containment booms
because currents keep shifting the plastic booms and snagging them
on the ship's bow.
   A 40-foot gray whale was found dead in an oil area Sunday, but
an autopsy revealed that the marine mammal ``died long before the
oil spill ever occurred,'' said Alaska Department of Fish and Game
spokeswoman Sheila Nickerson.
   Wildlife experts say many animals are found dead in Prince
William Sound in the spring.
   Officials said 119 dead sea otters have been counted and two
boats were waiting to unload additional dead animals. Hundreds of
dead birds have been counted, including some rare yellow-billed
loons and two eagles.
   But wildlife experts say the toll is really in the thousands
because most dead animals sink in the ocean or remain on shore.
   Six barrels of oil leaked Monday from the Keystone Canyon, while
the tanker was being loaded at the Valdez oil terminal, a spokesman
for Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said. The oil was captured by
containment boom and skimmers, Alyeska said.

   Stock prices fell sharply on the London Stock
Exchange Monday, depressed by continued fears that British interest
rates might have to rise to contain inflationary pressures.
   At the close the Financial Times 100 index was down 20.7 points,
or 1.01 percent, at 2025.0. The index plunged as much as 30.8
points shortly after the producer price index numbers were
released. At its best, the index was up 1.2 points at the opening.
   The Financial Times 500 index closed down 10.97 at 1151.34.
   Equities opened on shaky ground, following bearish forecasts for
the economy issued late last week by two leading stock brokerages.
   Prices then headed sharply lower following the release of the
producer price index for March. The data, on a seasonally adjusted
basis, suggested British manufacturers faced continued cost
pressures.
   Also depressing share prices was nervousness before a series of
additional economic figures later this week, including British
average earnings and employment data on Thursday, and British
inflation and U.S. trade numbers on Friday.

   The dollar strengthened slightly against most
major currencies in moderate trading Monday despite central bank
intervention.
   Gold prices moved ahead at home after a mixed performance
abroad. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $385.20
for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, $1.95 higher than
Friday's late bid.
   John McCarthy, chief dealer at Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank, said
the dollar was bid higher amid market rumors and continuing
reaction to the U.S. employment report issued Friday.
   According to one unconfirmed report that triggered dollar
purchases, U.S. Treasury officials have decided that the dollar is
trading at acceptable levels and that a lower dollar could be
inflationary and stem the flow of much-needed foreign capital into
the United States, McCarthy said.
   The Labor Department's report of a decline in the unemployment
rate to 5 percent last month from 5.1 percent in February was taken
as slightly supportive of the dollar.
   McCarthy said the U.S. currency rose in spite of dollar sales by
the Federal Reserve. He said the U.S. central bank sold dollars
when the currency was trading at around 1.88 West German marks.
   Currency dealers expect the dollar to trade in a narrow range
during the next few days as the market awaits a series of economic
statistics, including the Commerce Department report on retail
sales Thursday and the Labor Department's Producer Price Index on
Friday.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo by rising 0.45
Japanese yen to a closing of 132.53 yen. Later, in London, it edged
up further to 132.65 yen and in New York it finished at 132.90, up
from Friday's 132.725.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6995, more expensive for
buyers than $1.6975 late Friday.
   After European dealing ended, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson renewed the government's determination to fight
inflation, vowing to raise interest rates if necessary. The comment
spurred sterling purchases in U.S. trading and late in New York a
pound was quoted at $1.6955 compared to $1.6945 on Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's late
rates, included: 1.88325 West German marks, up from 1.8765; 1.66075
Swiss francs, up from 1.6499; 6.35675 French francs, up from 6.336;
1,379.45 Italian lire, up from 1,376.00; and, 1.18945 Canadian

   Takeover news and speculation provided almost
all of the action as the stock market turned in a mixed showing
Monday in quiet trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.93 to 2,301.87.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 726 up, 694
down and 553 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 123.99 million
shares, down from 156.95 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 150.61 million shares.
   Most analysts in the financial world believe economic growth has
begun to slow since the early weeks of the year.
   But hopes persisted among traders that that wouldn't stop most
companies from posting healthy earnings gains for the January-March
quarter.
   At the same time, market participants were looking ahead a bit
warily to the monthly report on the producer price index, due from
the government on Friday.
   Advance estimates call for the index, which serves as a gauge of
inflationary pressures in the economy, to show a smaller rise than
the 1 percent increases reported for January and February.
   If those expectations aren't fulfilled and the index comes in
with another bigger-than-expected rise, brokers say, it would touch
off talk of new credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve.
   Gulf &amp; Western climbed 2] to 51~ following the company's
announcement of plans to sell its Associates financial services
business and to concentrate on entertainment and publishing.
   Campbell Soup rose 4~ to 38\. After the death of John T.
Dorrance Sr., former chairman and son of the company's founder,
some traders concluded that the company might sooner or later be
sold.
   Gordon Jewelry jumped 5{ to 24. The company said it was studying
various possible transactions, including a recapitalization or sale
to some other party.
   Silicon Systems gained 1} to 19{. The company agreed to be
acquired by TDK Corp. of Japan for $20 a share.
   American Building Maintenance, which said it ended talks with a
potential buyer, tumbled 5{ to 31~.
   Exxon led the active list, down } at 42 under more of the
selling pressure that has hit the stock since the oil spill last
month near Valdez, Alaska.
   None of the other 29 stocks that make up the Dow Jones
industrials showed more than a fractional change.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $1.19 billion, or 0.04
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .04 to 166.89.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .18 to 342.48, while
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down .05 at 297.11.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
.43 to 411.14, its highest level since the crash in 1987. At the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at 331.40,
up .81.

<HEAD>Three New Executive Vice Presidents At Ford; Chairman Made $10.5
Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. Chairman Donald Petersen earned
$10.5 million in compensation last year, mainly from exercising
stock options, the company said Monday.
   Separately, Ford announced the appointments of three new
executive vice presidents including Allan Gilmour, who is
considered Petersen's likely successor.
   The compensation for Petersen and four other top executives was
detailed in Ford's annual proxy statement, which is being mailed to
shareholders in advance of the company's May 11 annual meeting.
   Ford was the nation's most profitable automaker last year, with
earnings of $5.3 billion.
   Petersen got $3.3 million in salary, bonuses and other benefits
and gained $7.2 million from exercising stock options last year.
   His compensation topped the $3.7 million Chrysler Corp. Chairman
Lee Iacocca received for 1988. General Motors Corp. was expected to
issue its proxy statement within a week.
   Ford President Harold Poling earned $4.1 million, including $2.6
million in salary and other compensation and $1.5 million from
exercised stock options.
   Last year, Ford reported that Petersen exercised no stock
options and received $3.7 million. Poling last year exercised stock
options worth $8 million and received $10.9 million in total
compensation.
   United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber and Vice President
Stephen Yokich, who heads the union's Ford Department, criticized
the payments as part of ``Detroit's annual executive pigout.''
   ``We think it would be far better advised to invest in new
facilities and hire more employees rather than squander valuable
resources on trying to keep up with the junk bond barons,'' they
said in a statement.
   Other Ford officers listed in Monday's proxy statement, along
with their salaries, supplemental compensation payments and stock
options exercised, were:
   _Louis R. Ross, executive vice president for North American
automotive operations and named Monday as executive vice president
for international automotive operations, $3.5 million.
   _Philip Benton, executive vice president and president of the
Ford Automotive Group, $3 million.
   _Gilmour, Ross' predecessor in international operations who was
appointed executive vice president for corporate staffs, $1.7
million.
   The appointments of Gilmour, Ross and Alexander Trotman, who
succeeds Rosee, become effective May 1.
   Because Gilmour was the only one of the three also named to the
office of the chief executive _ which is shared by Petersen, Poling
and Executive Vice President Stanley Seneker, the company's chief
financial officer _ he is seen as the likely choice to succeed
Petersen when the chairman reaches Ford's mandatory retirement age
of 65 in the fall of 1991.
   At the end of March, Vice Chairman William Clay Ford Sr.,
grandson of the company's founder, retired from the company and his
title was eliminated. Ford, who was a member of the office of the
chief executive, will remain a member of the company's board of
directors.
   The promotion of Gilmour, 54, leaves only General Motors Corp.
without an heir apparent to its chairman. GM Chairman Roger B.
Smith is expected to retire when he turns 65 in July 1990.
   Last November, Chrysler Corp. promoted Gerald Greenwald to vice
chairman, tapping him as the likely successor to Chairman Lee
Iacocca, who is not expected to seek a new contract when his
expires in December 1991.
   Gilmour joined Ford in 1960 as a financial analyst. He has been
president of Ford Motor Credit Co., vice president and controller,
vice president for external and personnel affairs in 1984, and
executive vice president and chief financial officer in 1986. He
took over the company's international operations in October 1987.
   Ross has been executive vice president for North American
automobile operations since February 1985. He joined Ford in 1955
as a research engineer. In the 1950s and '60s he worked in various
jobs in the engineering and manufacturing ends of the business. He
later worked overseas and in Ford's truck operations before moving
to the North American operations.
   Trotman joined Ford of Britain in 1955 and had a variety of
planning responsibilities before being elected vice president for
Ford's European truck operations in 1979. Last year, he became
president of Ford of Europe. Last February, he was appointed
executive vice president for North American automotive operations.

   Petroleum futures rose in volatile trading
Monday, led by strength in the gasoline market as the start of the
summer driving season continued to increase demand.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for
unleaded gasoline rose 2.34 cents to 67.29 cents a gallon.
Contracts for delivery between June and September also showed
strong gains, up more than a penny.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, closed 57 cents higher at $20.59 a barrel. And
heating oil for May delivery ended the day at 53.45 cents a gallon,
up 1.85 cents from last Friday's session.
   Analysts attributed the market's strength largely to technical
trading in advance of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly
report on oil and gas inventories. The report is scheduled for
release after the close of trading on Tuesday.
   ``People are anticipating bullish (numbers),'' said James R.
Fiedler, vice president of energy brokering for E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc. ``They're anticipating draw-downs in
gasoline and crude oil as the ramifications continue of the Valdez
disaster.''
   Two weeks ago, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez went aground off the
Alaskan coast spilling thousands of barrels of its cargo into
Prince William Sound. The spill temporarily halted oil shipments
from Alaska.
   Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy investments at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,said strong seasonal demand for
gasoline and new summer octane regulations likely to strain
refinery capacity gave the market its initial strength.
   The regulations scheduled to take effect next month mandate
higher octane levels in an effort to reduce vapor emissions.
   Reports of a continued slowdown in British crude oil production
stemming from problems in the North Sea also lifted the market,
analysts said.

   Eastern Airlines isn't ready to soar back
immediately to major-carrier status, even once striking employees
agree to return to work at the crippled airline.
   Once Eastern's unions agree to return, it could take 10 days for
the airline to restore 80 percent of its pre-strike schedule of
1,040 flights daily, said Karen Ceremsak, an Eastern spokeswoman.
   Airliners idled for weeks must be ``de-pickled'' and moved from
Miami hangars to other airports; crew members must be ferried back
to their bases; laid-off non-union workers must be called back, if
they're even available; and myriad operations from food to fares to
computerized scheduling must be addressed before Eastern can fly
the bulk of its pre-strike schedule.
   ``You can't just go the same day you get the signal,'' Ms.
Ceremsak said. ``We have to make scheduling decisions and there are
a lot of details and all those little, behind-the-scenes things.''
   Last week, in announcing an agreement for a group led by Peter
V. Ueberroth to buy Eastern, Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo
said the airline could return to ``significant'' amounts of service
within 24 hours after its unions reached new work agreements with
the prospective new management.
   The group has offered the unions a 30 percent stake in Eastern
in return for cost-saving contract concessions.
   Sources said the Ueberroth group reached tentative agreements
with union representatives during weekend negotiations and on
Monday the parties met with U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland,
who must approve the sale.
   Lifland also would have to approve any plan governing would-be
passengers whose tickets became useless when Eastern was struck.
The value of the unused tickets is estimated at about $200 million
and the holders are considered unsecured creditors.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said he didn't know what effect
the completed sale of the airline would have on ticketholders,
adding it was probably premature to make any predictions about
ticketing.
   Eastern was virtually grounded after its pilots and flight
attendants unions began honoring a March 4 strike by its Machinists
and sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors on March 9.
   With a few thousand non-union employees and some 200 pilots, the
airline rebuilt its schedule to about 110 flights daily, focusing
on its Northeastern shuttle and Latin American routes.
   To return Eastern to full service will require preparation on
numerous fronts:
   _Less than 15 percent of Eastern's 250-plane fleet has been
flying and at least 50 planes have been ``pickled,'' or taken out
of service. Their engines, vents and intakes have been sealed to
prevent damage and Ms. Ceremsak estimated it requires 100 man-hours
per plane to return them to service. The other idled planes have
been undergoing maintenance checks.
   _Eastern's parked planes are all in Miami, Atlanta or New York.
Eastern served 118 cities before its strike and its planes and crew
members, most of them scattered to their homes, must be ferried to
the appropriate airports.
   _Catering contracts have to be resumed or obtained, fuel made
available and computers re-loaded with new scheduling information.
   _Some of the 3,400 pilots who haven't flown since March 4 may
have to undergo refresher training required by the Federal Aviation
Administration if they haven't made at least three takeoffs and
landings within 90 days. Ms. Ceremsak had no estimate of how many
pilots would need that training.
   The company also will have to replace non-striking workers who
went on to other jobs after being laid off when Eastern slashed its
flight schedule.
   ``We don't have any estimate on how many would choose to come
back to work,'' Ms. Ceremsak said of the nearly 12,000 non-union
employees, who include skycaps, clerical workers and reservations
agents.
   There also will be emotional issues.
   ``I think there's definitely going to be some bad feelings''
between union employees returning to work and management holdovers
and any others who worked said Rick Iacino, a Machinists union
general chairman. ``There's no way in hell you can stop people's
feelings.''
   Even once it is capable of flying its pre-strike schedule,
Eastern still must rebound from virtually no advance sales, weeks
of negative publicity and passenger defections to other airlines
that aggressively have been moving into Eastern's turf.
   Ms. Ceremsak said the airline likely would offer incentives such
as sharply discounted fares or buy-one, get-one-free ``companion''
ticket offers.

<HEAD>Regulator Says Review Of C&amp;S Takeover Bid Could Take Up To 18 Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state banking commissioner said Monday it
could take up to 18 months _ three times the normal period _ to
review NCNB Inc.'s bid to acquire Citizens &amp; Southern Corp.
   C&amp;S officials said the long wait may kill the takeover attempt,
but NCNB said it feels there are no legal or regulatory impediments
to the merger.
   The C&amp;S board last week rejected a $2.4 billion stock exchange
offer that NCNB said would create the nation's sixth largest
banking company. NCNB reportedly has been preparing a new offer,
and the North Carolina banking company Monday dismissed the notion
that the proposed merger would require a lengthy review process.
   Georgia Banking Commissioner Jack Dunn released a statement
outlining the regulatory matters that could be involved in the
consideration of a NCNB-C&amp;S deal. Dunn said such a review would not
begin until the Department of Banking and Finance received a merger
application.
   ``Although a final decision would normally be reached within six
months, applications involving complex legal and technical issues
have required 12 to 18 months state-federal regulatory time,'' Dunn
said.
   C&amp;S officials seized upon Dunn's statement, saying it confirmed
their position that NCNB's bid has serious regulatory problems.
   ``Given the length of time for the state to resolve these
issues, and the uncertainty of a successful resolution, we think
NCNB's bid is dead,'' said C&amp;S Chairman Bennett A. Brown. ``It is
time for both of our institutions to get back to the business of
banking.''
   Ben Johnson, an attorney with Alston &amp; Bird, C&amp;S' corporate
counsel, said, ``Twelve to 18 months is a pretty long period of
time for a deal like this to be in limbo.''
   Johnson said the value of NCNB stock, during the period, ``can
be all over the place.''
   NCNB spokeswoman Lynn Easley said from her company's
headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., that Dunn broke no ground in his
statement and that he simply recited the law.
   ``NCNB is quite confident there are no legal or regulatory
impediments to the merger it has proposed to the Citizens &amp;
Southern Corp.,'' Ms. Easley said.
   Many of the items referred to in Dunn's statement are legal
matters that regulators would be required to consider in any bank
acquisition proposal. Some appeared to have particular relevance to
the NCNB-C&amp;S proposal and would require consultation with the
Georgia Department of Law, Dunn said.
   One such issue is whether NCNB's interests in Texas would
jeopardize its eligibility to acquire the Atlanta-based C&amp;S. NCNB
last year paid more than $200 million for a 20 percent stake in
First RepublicBank Corp. after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
chose NCNB to manage and operate the financially ailing Texas
facility.
   Dunn said an acquisition may be rejected if it involves a
holding company that has its largest aggregate state deposit base
outside the 11-state Southern Region (which does not include Texas)
or has more than 20 percent of its aggregate deposit base outside
the region.
   There are exceptions to that provision, however, including the
presence of insolvent banks, Dunn said. The Texas bank's insolvency
at the time of NCNB's involvement could affect the interpretation
of the regulations.
   ``The statement released by (Dunn) simply restates the law and
regulations governing approval for interstate banking
acquisitions,'' Ms. Easley said. ``It raises no new legal or
regulatory issues.''

<HEAD>Taiwan Offers Credit to U.S. Exporters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ Taiwan's Export-Import Bank announced plans Monday
to provide loans to American companies to help encourage American
exports and reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit with the island.
   The loans are part of the Taiwan government's continuing
campaign to persuade Taiwanese firms to ``buy American,'' said K.W.
Kung, executive vice president of the Export-Import Bank of the
Republic of China on Taiwan.
   Kung said the bank has $200 million to lend to American
companies to help them export machinery and other goods and
services to Taiwan against deferred payment from purchasers.
   Kung plans to take his loan message to eight U.S. cities
stretching from Boston and New York to Seattle and Los Angeles.
   The unique effort to promote another country's exports stemmed
from concern in Taiwan that it would be targeted under new U.S.
trade laws directed against countries who persistently sell more to
the United States than they buy.
   Sheu Ke-Sheng, economic director of Taiwan's Washington mission,
said that within four years the surplus should be ``largely
eliminated, but to reduce it to zero is very difficult.''
   The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan dropped from $18 to $14.1
billion from 1987 to 1988 and is expected to narrow by at least 10
percent a year, he said. Sheu said his government's own statistics
showed the Taiwan surplus dropped from $16 billion to $10.4 billion
the past year.
   U.S. trade with Taiwan started registering deficits in the early
1970s and since then the island has sent 15 ``Buy American''
purchasing missions to the United States, reduced import tariffs 16
times and, more recently, appreciated its currency 49 percent
against the U.S. dollar, Sheu said.
   Another round of tariff reductions will be announcd in a few
weeks and plans call for reducing Taiwan's average tariff, at 5.5
percent now comparable to that of the United States, to 3.5 percent
within four years, he added.
   Kung said U.S. exporters hoping to use Taiwan Export-Import Bank
credit may contact any of about 40 U.S. major and regional banks
authorized to borrow from his bank at 6.55 percent annual interest,
making for a relending rate to the exporter of approximately 8.3
percent.

<HEAD>Fears of Tight Supplies Lift Copper Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices posted significant gains Monday at the New
York Commodity Exchange on concerns about tight supplies.
   On other markets, unleaded gasoline led a modest rally in energy
futures; sugar futures were clobbered by profit-taking; and live
hog futures advanced on speculation that marketings would drop as
farmers concentrated on spring planting.
   The move in copper followed an erratic performance last week,
when the metal skyrocketed last Wednesday on the heels of five
straight slumping sessions.
   Copper at the Comex began the day strong, shrugged off reports
of higher-than-expected stocks at the London Mercantile Exchange,
broke an important resistance level at $1.38 per pound and held the
gains.
   ``Several producers are supposed to be experiencing tightness,
but we had one report out of Chile that there are actual problems
supplying,'' said William O'Neill, director of research for Elders
Futures Inc., New York.
   ``Then, we got rumors that a major New York trading house was
looking to take a substantial amount out of the Comex warehouse and
refine it into high-grade copper,'' he added. ``The speculation is
that it may be related to a shortage one of the producers is
experiencing.''
   Copper futures prices settled 6.60 cents to 7.80 cents higher,
with the contract for delivery in April at $1.416 a pound.
   Among the precious metals, gold advanced $2.30 to $2.60, with
April on the Comex at $386 a troy ounce; silver was 5.2 cents to
6.4 cents higher, with April at $5.821 a troy ounce.
   Gasoline was the surprise leader among the energy futures
because demand for the product doesn't peak until the start of the
summer driving season. Monday's rally also looked past reports that
several OPEC members were ignoring production quotas, pushing the
cartel's daily output to 20 million barrels per day.
   Crude oil rose 2 cents to 57 cents, with the May contract at the
New York Mercantile Exchange settling at $20.59 a barrel; heating
oil was unchanged to 1.85 cents higher, with May at 53.45 cents a
gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .80 cent to 2.25 cents higher,
with May at 67.20 cents a gallon.
   Sugar futures were .32 cent to .50 cent lower on the New York
Coffee, Cocoa and Sugar Exchange, with the May contract at 11.88
cents a pound.
   ``The recent strength had as much to do with today's loss as
anything,'' said Arthur Stevenson, analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. New York.
   ``There were so many rumors going around about buys by this
country or that and a lot of people got nervous and started taking
profits in case none of it materializes,'' he added.
   Ironically, rumors that Mexico bought as much as 280,000 tons in
recent days made the rounds just minutes after the market closed.
   Live hog futures were the only positive note in the complex at
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   ``Many pork producers grow their own feed and now is the time
they start field preparations for the feed crops,'' said Chuck
Levitt, analyst for Shearon Lehman Hutton Inc., Chicago. ``As
planting operations get busy, marketing the hogs becomes less of a
priority. The futures gain on anticipation that fewer will be
marketed in the coming months.''
   Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .02 cent higher, with
April at 77.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .50
cent lower, with April at 77.17 cents a pound; live hogs were .05
cent to .67 cent higher, with April at 39.82 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .20 cent higher, with
May at 34.20 cents a pound.
   Grain futures prices closed mixed, but soybeans mostly higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   On the close, wheat was 4{ cents lower to 3 cents higher, with
the contract for May delivery at $3.94{; corn was 1 cent lower to 1
cent higher, with May at $2.66}; oats were { cent to 1{ cents
higher, with May at $1.87; and soybeans were 6} cents to 8} cents
higher, with May at $7.18{.

<HEAD>Intel Introduces i486 Chip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ROCKS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp. unveiled its i486 computer chip
Monday while at least seven computer and software makers announced
plans to produce new products based on the chip.
   ``This is not really an Intel event, this is an industry
event,'' Intel Vice President Dave House said in announcing the
i486 at the Comdex trade show here. ``It's our alliance with the
software industry that brings out the strength in our products.''
   The company also announced a faster version of its 80386 chip
and a lower-power version of its less-expensive 80386SX chip that
is suited for laptop computers.
   The new i486, also known as the 80486, puts Intel into
head-to-head competition with Motorola Inc.'s 68040 chip announced
less than two weeks ago, industry analysts said. It crams 1.2
million transistors onto a piece of silicon just over a half-inch
square.
   The 80386, by contrast, contains one-fourth as many transistors,
or 275,000.
   A computer with the chip will perform operations 50 times faster
than the original IBM personal computer and will be able to run any
software developed for the 80386, House said.
   Meanwhile, Intel said six companies _ American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., Award Software Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Microsoft
Corp., Phar Lap Software Inc., and Phoenix Technologies Ltd. _
announced products based on the technology.
   In addition, Prime Computer Inc. said it would work with Intel
to design processors based on the i486 that would run eight times
faster than the i486 alone.
   ``The 486 is a fantastic advance. It's a major improvement in
speed, but it is the same architecture as the 386,'' said Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates. ``The most exciting thing is the protection it
offers the investment'' that users have made in software.
   The chip will not be available until this fall, and won't be
produced in quantity until late this year, Intel said in a news
release.
   The new 80386 chip, called the 80386DX, will run at 33 million
cycles per second and is 25 times faster than the original IBM PC,
House said.
   Computer and software makers, meanwhile, praised the
announcement of the i486 and stressed the importance of the new
chip's compatibility with the 80386.
   ``That level of compatibility ensures that the software you run
today will run on future workstations,'' said John Frank, president
of Zenith Data Systems.
   ``Now we'll see a stable platform for software development over
the next several years that will allow the full capabilities of the
386 architecture to be implemented,'' said Rod Canion, president
and chief executive of Compaq Computer Corp.
   Karl Koessel, technical editor of PC World magazine, called the
chip ``the next generation'' of computer technology.
   ``It is much faster and it is compatible,'' Koessel said. ``What
people want is compatibility, and the 486 does everything the 386
does.''

   Gulf Air said Monday it will spend $1
billion over the next five years to buy 18 aircraft from the
European consortium Airbus Industrie and the U.S. manuacturer
Boeing Co.
   Gulf Air spokesman Abdullah Abdel-Karim said the airliners will
include 12 Airbus A-320s and six Boeing 767s. Abdel-Karim said the
deal was being made on an optional basis, allowing the airline to
drop an order without ann liability to compensate the manufacturer.
   A spokesman for Seattle-based Boeing said it has held talks with
Gulf Air about purchasing 767s, but declined to confirm the deal.
   Gulf Air is owned by the governments of Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and
Abu Dhabi. The announcement came one day after Gulf Air's board met
in the Qatari capital of Doha.
   Abdel-Karim said that the 18 new jets will be delivered between
1990 and 1994. Gulf Air is currently spending $260 million as part
of a modernization program involving the lease of four Boeing
767-300s.
   The airline last week secured a $208 million loan from 22
international and regional banks to cover part of the modenization.
It expects to cover the balance of $52 million with a similar
credit from Japanese institutions.
   Abdel-Karim said that by June the airline will have nine
Tri-Stars, eight Boeing 737s and six Boeing 767-300s. The fleet
will increase to 40 to 42 aircraft by 1994, he added.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Frontier Chapter 11 Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has approved a
reorganization plan for defunct Frontier Airlines, which sought
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August 1986 when it shut down
for good.
   The reorganization plan, approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Charles Matheson on Friday, allows about 500 of Frontier's former
employees and others to be paid 100 percent of court-approved
claims.
   Continental Airlines bought Denver-based Frontier's assets for
$119 million after negotiations to sell Frontier to United Airlines
fell through.
   Under the reorganization plan, Continental, a unit of Texas Air
Corp., would receive $20 million to $70 million after all other
creditors are paid. The total of the individual payments was not
released.
   ``There's no question this is a great deal for Continental,''
said Bill Waller, a Denver lawyer representing the claims of 57
former Frontier employees.
   Waller said his clients will receive ``substantial payments''
from Frontier and Continental. ``We're generally satisfied,'' he
said.
   Frontier's creditors gave nearly 95 percent approval to the plan
in a vote taken March 31. The plan calls for former employees and
others to receive either cash or a combination of cash and notes
for their allowed claims.
   Most of Frontier's former employees dropped their claims against
the airline two years ago in exchange for limited cash settlements
and jobs at Continental. Lawyers estimate that only about 500
employees are still owed money.
   The claims range from a few hundred dollars to ``a few hundred
thousand dollars for some former officers of Frontier,'' said Carl
Eklund, the lawyer who shepherded the reorganization plan through
the courts for Frontier and Continental.
   Matheson's approval of the reorganization plan does not settle
all claims against Frontier. The defunct airline still faces more
than $268 million in outstanding claims, although that amount is
expected to be trimmed substantially, said Eklund.
   Waller speculated that when all the claims are paid under the
reorganization plan, Continental's take could reach $100 million.
He said that does not count the route structure, the planes and the
employees Continental also received when it purchased Frontier's
assets.
   Others involved in the case, however, estimated Continental
would receive $20 million to $70 million.

   Texas A&amp;M University and Georgia Tech researchers said Monday
they believed they had duplicated a Utah experiment that produced
nuclear fusion using basic chemistry.
   Texas A&amp;M's experiment generated energy, but chemists Charles
Martin, Kenneth Marsh and Bruce Gammon said they were not sure it
resulted from fusion.
   The University of Utah scientists who first claimed the result,
however, backed up their colleagues' work.
   The Texas A&amp;M reaction was detected early Saturday and came
after more than two weeks of intense work to duplicate the Utah
research, the chemists said.
   ``The excess energy aspect has been confirmed,'' said Martin,
35, an electro-chemist. But the reaction was so small the
scientists did not have equipment sophisticated enough to detect
the production of neutrons that would certify the reaction as
fusion, he said.
   Fusion occurs when the nuclei of atoms join together, releasing
energy.
   ``This is a very unusual result and we have not totally
dismissed the possibility of some unusual chemical process which we
might have not accounted for and we are currently exploring this
possibility further,'' Martin said.
   However, while Texas A&amp;M's research focused on the energy
produced by the process, Georgia Tech's weekend experiment looked
for neutrons _ and found them. A probe which measured 40 neutrons
an hour of normal background radiation measured 600 an hour during
the experiment.
   ``We think we've confirmed the Utah experiment to prove `cold
fusion,''' senior research scientist James Mahaffey told a news
conference in Atlanta following Texas A&amp;M's announcement.
   Mahaffey cautioned that his team had not confirmed the process
produces more energy than it consumes.
   The Texas chemists detected energy in the form of excess heat
using a calorimeter built to detect temperature variations as low
as 0.001 of a degree, said Marsh, 49, director of the school's
Thermodynamics Research Center.
   The reaction produced more energy as heat than the scientists
were putting into it in the form of electric current.
   Marsh said the likelihood was small that the energy was produced
by a chemical, and not nuclear, reaction.
   ``But we have to investigate,'' he said. ``It's a most unusual
scientific observation and could have considerable repercussions in
the scientific world.''
   The chemists' counterparts in Utah, Stanley Pons and Martin
Fleischmann, said the Texas results were ``almost precisely the
same as those we've reported.''
   Pons said of the Georgia Tech work: ``This is just incredible.
That's one of the nicest things that could happen.''
   Pons said he expected increased efforts by scientists around the
world to confirm the experiment. Many scientists had expressed
profound skepticism that such fusion could be achieved without
superhigh heat, as the Utah researchers claim.
   Last week, two Hungarian scientists claimed to have duplicated
the Utah results, Hungary's official MTI news agency reported.
   Pons, chairman of the chemistry department at the university in
Salt Lake City, and Fleischmann, of Southampton University in
England, on March 23 claimed to have sustained a controlled fusion
reaction using common laboratory equipment.
   Scientists long have sought the peaceful use of nuclear fusion,
which powers the sun and hydrogen bombs and is viewed as a possible
replacement for conventional energy sources. It would be clean,
inexpensive and virtually inexhaustable.
   Unlike nuclear fission reactors now in use, fusion does not
generate significant amounts of radioactive waste.
   ``There is a need for much more money for research in this area
if it is going to get the attention it deserves,'' Martin said.
``But that's not surprising since this didn't exist two weeks ago.''
   ``It's open season on fusion,'' Mahaffey said.
   In the Texas A&amp;M experiment, a palladium electrode 1mm in
diameter and 50mm long was surrounded by a platinum counter
electrode and bathed in 100 cubic centimeters of heavy water _
containing atoms of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen _ heated
to 80.6 degrees.
   The scientists detected a constant 1.144-watt energy gain in the
experiment.
   ``Once we understand what's going on, then we do what engineers
call a `scale-up,''' said Kenneth Hall, associate dean of the
College of Engineering at Texas A&amp;M. ``We have one watt. We need to
go to hundreds and thousands of watts.''
   The researchers measured excess heat that had no obvious
chemical source and also found gamma rays, neutrons and tritium _
another isotope of hydrogen _ above those expected as normal
background radiation.
   School officials said the lab area was checked for radioactivity
but no harmful levels were detected.

<HEAD>Deadline Apparently Passes for Drexel-SEC Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal prosecuror indicated Monday that a
deadline that could jeopardize Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
landmark criminal plea deal with the government passed without an
extension.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird said there was no written
agreement extending the Monday deadline for the Wall Street
investment firm to settle separate civil securities fraud charges
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Baird, who heads the office's securities and commodities fraud
unit, had said the government did not plan a lengthy extension of
the deadline. Apparently none was made Monday.
   ``The only letter that there is the letter that extends the
deadline until April 10,'' Baird said. ``There isn't any other
writing or agreement.''
   Baird declined to say whether that meant the deadline indeed had
passed, but he said, ``Nothing formal has changed at all.''
   He also refused to say what action the Manhattan U.S. attorney's
office might take if no pact was reached by the deadline.
   Failure to reach agreement could nullify the U.S. attorney's
office's plea deal with Drexel and raise the possibility of a far
more serious indictment on fraud and racketeering charges.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said he did not know whether a
deadline had been extended, but added: ``We're still conversing,
we're still negotiating.''
   SEC officials and Drexel attorneys were reported to have left
their offices for the day and could not be reached for comment
Monday evening.
   Settling civil charges including insider trading brought by the
SEC last September was a precondition for Drexel's criminal plea
bargain three months later. The firm agreed to plead guilty to six
felonies and pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution.
   Officials familiar with the talks indicated earlier Monday that
an agreement between the SEC and Drexel was imminent, possibly by
the end of the day. But no announcement came from any quarter.
   Drexel and the SEC initially agreed to complete their
negotiations Jan. 30. That deadline was extended several times by
mutual consent of prosecutors and Drexel as talks deadlocked.
   The U.S. attorney's office governs the terms of the SEC-Drexel
talks.
   One of the major snags in the talks reportedly had been an SEC
demand that Drexel fire Michael Milken, who took a leave of absence
after he and two others were charged with 98 counts of racketeering
and securities fraud. Drexel has a policy that all indicted
employees must be placed on leave.
   Milken pleaded innocent Friday to the charges and was released
pending negotiations on setting bond. On Monday, U.S. District
Judge Kimba Wood rescheduled from Tuesday to Wednesday a hearing on
an expected agreement between prosecutors and Milken's lawyers on
posting a bond.
   The government reportedly sought under racketeering laws to have
Milken post a $1 billion bond to avoid pretrial restraints on
assets that may be seized upon conviction.
   But a bond arrangement could allow Milken to place a substantial
amount of money in an account to be monitored by the government
rather than posting the bond. Baird and lawyers for Milken declined
to comment Monday on the bond talks.

<HEAD>First Pentagon Corruption Trial Goes to Jury</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 4th graf, `Stan Morrison ...,' to UPDATE

   Jurors began deliberation Monday in the
trial of three California businessmen who a prosecutor said were
involved in ``bribery, cheating and lying'' in the Pentagon
corruption case.
   ``They cannot wash their hands of their guilt,'' Assistant U.S.
Attorney Joseph Aronica said in his closing arguments before the
jury began deciding the case. ``But for these defendants, the
grease for the skids would not have flowed,'' Aronica said.
   But attorneys for the three _ Eugene Sullivan, Dale Schnittjer
and George Kaub _ declared their clients were innocent victims of a
conspiracy carried out by a ring of private consultants.
   Stan Mortenson, Schnittjer's attorney, said his client ``had no
stake in this matter ... he had no incentive'' to defraud the
government.
   The jury deliberated the case for eight hours Monday without
reaching a decision. The panel was sent home and was to return
Tuesday morning.
   All three men are former executive vice presidents of Teledyne
Electronics in Newbury Park, Calif., a defense contractor whose
parent firm, Teledyne Inc., has already pleaded guilty to
conspiracy in the Pentagon fraud case.
   The defendants are charged with bribery, conspiracy and wire
fraud, the third charge stemming from telephone conversations they
had with a private consultant, William Parkin, who also has pleaded
guilty.
   Kaub is also accused of making false statements to the
government.
   During the week-long trial the jury heard tape recordings of
conversations that had been monitored by federal agents during the
course of the ``Operation Ill Wind'' investigation into kickbacks
in the Pentagon's purchasing system.
   So far the three men are the only ones who have been brought to
trial in the Ill Wind case, which began nearly three years ago.
However, at least half a dozen other people have pleaded guilty in
the case and are cooperating with the government.
   Summing up the government's case, Aronica said that Parkin was
hired in November 1985, for $10,000, to help Teledyne win a $24
million contract to build hand-held radar equipment. Parkin was to
be paid an additional $150,000 once Teledyne landed the job, which
it did in the summer of 1987.
   All told, Parkin received about $28,000 before public disclosure
of the investigation in June 1988.
   Parkin testified that he and another consultant, Fred Lackner,
paid bribes to Stuart Berlin, a Navy engineer, for assistance on
the Teledyne contract. But defense lawyers said the Teledyne
executives never knew about the scheme.
   Aronica said, ``As long as no one was blunt and no one blurted
out bribery and payoffs ... they felt at ease ... to be able to
deny any knowledge, to be able to hide behind a veneer of
deniability.''
   But he said it would be nonsense for a sophisticated company
such as Teledyne to sign a $150,000 ``back channel'' agreement with
a consultant such as Parkin when it could get the same information
from its marketing staff _ unless Parkin was performing other,
illegitimate services. That, in fact, was the case, the prosecutor
said.
   ``This was a case about bribery, cheating and lying _ that's
exactly what it is,'' he said.
   Lawyers for the three defendants all said their clients were
unwitting victims of Parkin's scheme to defraud the government.
   Schnittjer, who came to the company as a finance supervisor
several months after Teledyne Electronics landed the radar
contract, was simply following orders from above when he started
paying Parkin a portion of the $150,000 in 1988, Mortenson said.
   ``Dale Schnittjer is innocent,'' the lawyer said.
   Kaub's lawyer, Mark Tuohey, said his client wasn't even in the
country during much of the time that Teledyne Electronics was
working to land the radar contract. Moreover, he said that some of
the government's witnesses admitted that their aim was to defraud
Teledyne and ``then hide the ball.''
   The motive of private consultants Parkin and Lackner as well as
Berlin was ``get everything you can and don't tell anybody about
it,'' he said.
   Sullivan's attorney, George O'Connell, said, ``My client was
kept in the dark.''

<HEAD>Cineplex Odeon Executives To Control Theater Chain Through Stock
Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two top executives of Cineplex Odeon Corp.,
the major U.S. and Canadian theater operator and movie production
house, will effectively take control of the Toronto-based company
under a stock purchase announced Monday.
   Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of The Seagram Co. Ltd., sold his
7.3 million shares in the company to a group led by Cineplex
Chairman Garth Drabinsky, officials announced.
   ``It was good timing for us,'' Drabinsky said of the $127.1
million stock deal. ``The price was attractive enough to entice the
Bronfmans and at the same time a price we could finance.''
   Under the terms of the purchase, Drabinsky and Vice Chairman
Myron Gottlieb will end up with effective control of Cineplex for
at least two years.
   The group of 11 buyers, including Drabinsky and Gottlieb, paid
$17.50 a share for the block of common shares, which represents 29
percent of those outstanding.
   The deal closes May 3 and is subject to regulatory approval.
   Although Drabinsky and Gottlieb will only own a small portion of
the stock, an agreement with the nine other buyers lasting until
April 30, 1991, allows them to vote the shares as they please.
   When that block is combined with personal holdings, the pair
controls 38 percent of the common shares.
   MCA Inc., the U.S. media company, owns 48 percent of Cineplex's
shares through an issue of restricted-voting stock.
   While Drabinsky saw the move as good news, investors didn't see
it that way.
   Cineplex shares tumbled in early trading on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, dropping 63 cents to $16 shortly after the announcement.
They recovered to close at $16.25, off 38 cents on the day.

from Recruit, details. No pickup. Also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita on Tuesday
acknowledged receiving about $1 million from a company at the
center of a major bribery scandal, but he said the funds were only
donations and not bribes.
   Takeshita's comments at a meeting of the Parliament's budget
committee reversed statements made previously before Parliament,
when he denied ever receiving funds from Recruit Co., an
information and publishing conglomerate.
   Recent disclosures of Takeshita's financial links to Recruit and
its subsidiaries prompted the prime minister to speak formally
about his role in the stock profiteering and bribery scandal, which
has involved about 160 politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats.
   ``I am feeling political and moral responsibilities very
strongly,'' Takeshita said Tuesday. ``I think it is important to
settle this matter legally and politically.''
   He said that between 1985 and 1987 Recruit donated 130 million
yen (about $1 million) to his political support groups in donations
and purchases of fund-raising party tickets. Japanese law allows a
company the size of Recruit to make political donations of $114,000
a year.
   Takeshita said the funds were handled strictly as political
donations and denied opposition claims that they were bribes.
   ``Political donations are indispensible elements for vital
political activities, which are said to be the foundation of a
democratic society,'' he said. ``But the widespread Recruit scandal
and my position as a prime minister no longer allow me to speak in
such general terms.''
   Opposition lawmaker Kanji Kawasaki of the Japan Socialist Party
asked Takeshita what his understanding of Recruit's intentions was
when he accepted the money.
   Takeshita replied: ``I am not in a position of telling the
intent of another party's political donations.''
   He also denied any personal involvement in transactions of
bargain-priced unlisted shares in Recruit's real estate subsidiary
by his personal secretary and a relative. The transactions produced
about $200,000 in profits when the share price soared after
over-the-counter trading began.
   To opposition charges that he was reversing earlier statements,
Takeshita said: ``I do not remember the details of my statement,
but I probably did not have a clear recollections of the matter
then.''
   Recent disclosures of the governing Liberal Democratic Party's
links to the Recruit scandal have generated demands from the
political opposition that Takeshita resign and call elections to
allow the public to give its verdict on the scandal. Even some
members of Takeshita's own party want him to step down.
   ``Your hand is contaminated with money,'' said Kawasaki of the
Socialist Party. ``You must realize the ethics of Japan's democracy
are being questioned. You should resign immediately.''
   The prime minister has refused all demands that he resign,
insisting he will stay in office to carry out political reforms.
   Three people resigned from Takeshita's Cabinet after
acknowledging they had continued to receive Recruit donations after
the scandal erupted last summer, but Takeshita said he did not
receive any funds from the firm after 1987.
   So far, 14 people, including two vice ministers, have been
arrested on charges of violating bribery and securities laws in
connection with the Recruit scandal.
   No politicians have been arrested, but prosecutors have begun to
question politicians and their aides who received money or bought
stock from Recruit.
   Public support for Takeshita has declined to its lowest level
since public opinion polls on prime ministers began after the end
of World War II in 1945. One poll released Monday showed
Takeshita's approval rate at only 7.8 percent.
   ``The public is not going to be satisfied with your explanations
today,'' Kawasaki told Takeshita. ``I think the frustration and
anger of the public is on the verge of blowing up.''
   ``What we want is not an explanation from him (Takeshita) but
the act of responsibility by resigning immediately,'' Yukihisa
Yoshida of the Democratic Socialist Party, another major opposition
group, said Monday.
   Leaders of the Socialist, Komeito (Clean Government), Democratic
Socialist and United Social Democrat parties met last Friday in
Kyoto and agreed to continue pressing for Takeshita's resignation.
They also agreed on an outline for a coalition government they hope
might replace Takeshita's administration if he steps down.
   The combined opposition lacks sufficient votes in Parliament to
force Takeshita to resign or call elections.
   But it has brought a complete halt to parliamentary
deliberations on the nation's budget for fiscal 1989, which started
April 1. Before reopening debate, the opposition demanded the
government summon former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone to
testify on his connections to Recruit, or alternatively that the
entire Takeshita Cabinet resign.
