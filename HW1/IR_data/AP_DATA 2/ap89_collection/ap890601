   Along Florida waterways starting to resemble an
aquatic Interstate 95, a new kind of traffic is worrying the Marine
Patrol _ water scooters, sometimes piloted by children hardly old
enough to ride a bicycle.
   The model names ring with excitement: Kawasaki makes Jet Skis,
Yamaha sells Wave Runners and Progressive Power Corp. offers the
Surf Jet, for example.
   But the boats that resemble snowmobiles are increasingly a
factor in some of Florida's worst accidents, and complaints about
operators are growing.
   ``The Florida Marine Patrol seems to come in contact with an
awful lot of people who are not safe and responsible, who are not
reasonable and prudent,'' said patrol Capt. Mike Lamphear. ``They
have lost touch with reality.''
   A 9-year-old boy died in March after his scooter, dead in the
water, was hit by another of the 7-foot-long craft in Biscayne Bay
off Miami. A 5-year-old boy survived after his head and chest were
slashed open by a boat that ran over his scooter in a lake north of
Miami, also in March.
   J.B. Spence, attorney for the family of the 9-year-old victim,
accuses operators of terrorizing swimmers and other boaters and has
a personal lawsuit pending against riders who frequent a canal by
his house in the Florida Keys.
   ``You see what they're like. They're like bucking broncos, they
ride the wake, they race,'' said Spence, who likens the machines'
sound to the roar of a chainsaw. ``They're just absolutely so rude
and arrogant that I sued them. I'm going to take them into court
and try to teach them some manners.''
   The two Miami accidents have focused attention on the first
statewide effort to regulate the low-riding vessels that are
propelled by a concentrated jet of water. Riders sit or kneel on
the machines, depending on the model.
   The six manufacturers of personal watercraft, which generally
cost $2,500 to $4,500, support the legislation by state Sen. Tom
McPherson, and view it as a national model to regulate the skis and
their free-wheeling operators.
   The measure was approved unanimously in late April by the
Florida Senate and was passed overwhelmingly by the House last
Friday.
   Quick to realize they could be at risk from government
regulators, the manufacturers _ the other three are Wet Jet
International, Bombardier and Ultranautics _ support McPherson's
bill. It sets an operator age limit of 14 for private vessels and
16 for rentals, banning reckless operation, restricting operation
to daylight hours, requiring operators to wear floatation vests and
a cut-off switch to stop the engine if the rider falls off.
Violation, a second-degree misdemeanor, would carry a $35 fine or
60 days in jail.
   Weaving through congested traffic, jumping wakes and ``playing
chicken'' would be outlawed, said Maj. Denis Grealish, boating
safety coordinator for the marine patrol. ``None of our
investigations have revealed any inherent safety problem or defects
with the craft.
   ``All of our problems have been caused by operator error. When
you look at these types of craft and the type of quick, fast
movement they're capable of and the centrifugal forces operating
against these people as they're making turns, you have to have a
certain amount of strength, coordination, balance and judgment to
operate these things.''
   The Personal Watercraft Industry Association, representing the
six manufacturers, also is monitoring other efforts to regulate the
craft, such as an assortment of New Hampshire bills that would ban
the vessels on small lakes where residents have registered noise
complaints.
   The organization estimates that 150,000 Americans own the
scooters.
   Most regulations are imposed locally for specific water bodies,
but the industry hopes to take the Florida bill to Texas next in
its bid to spread the measure nationally, said John Dane,
government relations representative in Washington for the National
Marine Manufacturers Association.
   ``We're hoping this bill serves as a national model,'' Dane said.
   The problem in Florida is compounded by burgeoning enthusiasm
for boating. Roughly 680,000 vessels, including 10,000 personal
watercraft, are registered to operate along Florida's 1,350 miles
of coastline and 11,000 miles of rivers, creeks and streams.
Grealish estimates another 200,000 to 300,000 boats operate in
Florida on a transient basis.
   The state leads the nation in boating fatalities with 106 in
1987 and 94 in 1988. Six involved personal watercraft last year. Of
the state's 11 fatalities with personal watercraft, only two
involved minors. Most victims are men ranging from their late teens
to mid 30s.
   McPherson has used the 1987 ban on manufacture of three-wheel
all-terrain vehicles, blamed for nearly 1,000 deaths and 300,000
injuries in five years, as a club in his bid to regulate personal
watercraft.
   Manufacturers ``first were kind of resistant to any
legislation,'' he said. But he noted in conversations with industry
representatives that ``three-wheelers went by the wayside because
they didn't have regulations, and the same thing could happen to
Jet Skis.''

   The government says it has granted
deposed Paraguayan President Alfredo Stroessner permanent political
asylum.
   Brazil gave the 76-year-old former dictator a permanent visa on
May 24, according to Wednesday's ``Diario Oficial,'' the government
publication that announces official acts.
   Gen. Stroessner, ousted in a bloody coup after 34 years in
power, arrived in Brazil on Feb. 5 and lives in a beachfront
mansion in the coastal resort town of Guaratuba about 500 miles
southwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   In early April, Stroessner requested a temporary visa to the
United States to receive surgery for prostate cancer, but was
turned down by the State Department. Soon afterward, he was
hospitalized three days with a mild congestive heart failure at Sao
Paulo's Heart Institute.
   Brazil also granted a permanent visa to Stroessner's wife, Maria
Eugenia Heikel, but did not mention the ex-general's oldest son
Gustavo, who followed Stroessner into exile and is living in the
southeastern city of Curitiba.
   Col. Gustavo Stroessner, 46, faces charges in Paraguay of
extortion and illegal use of government funds during his father's
regime.
   Paraguayan justice officials have announced they would request
his extradition from Brazil.

   A Soviet seaman was missing after
reportedly jumping into the Dardanalles strait while attempting to
defect to Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia news agency said.
   The agency identified the missing seaman as engineer Tetkhiladze
Archil, who was aboard the Soviet freighter Nikolai Kuznetsov. It
quoted the ship's captain as saying Archil jumped into the strait
before dawn Wednesday.
   The Soviet vessel, en route from Spain to a Soviet Black Sea
port, searched unsuccessfully for the seaman before continuing its
voyage, the agency said.
   Anatolia quoted unidentified local officials as saying it would
be very difficult for the seaman to survive and swim to shore
because of the strong currents in the strait, which is up to 6
miles wide at some places.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun sleeps with a pistol
under his pillow and rarely leaves his bunker since his crusade to
drive Syria out of Lebanon has made him the target of at least one
assassination attempt.
   Aides say the stocky, 54-year-old Maronite Christian leader
believes he tops Syria's most-wanted list.
   But Aoun shows no sign of surrendering to the foes who outnumber
his mainly Christian forces 4-1, despite an inferno of Syrian
artillery and rocket fire in the last three months and a blockade
of the beleaguered Christian enclave. The fighting has killed at
least 360 people.
   Aides said Aoun has left the command bunker at the presidential
palace only once or twice since he proclaimed his ``war of
liberation'' against Syria and its Moslem allies March 8, fueling
the latest round of the 14-year civil war.
   The weekend arrests in Cyprus of six Lebanese only underlines
Aoun's fears. The six, believed to belong to a Syrian-backed group,
confessed they plotted to shoot down the Christian leader's
helicopter with missiles.
   Aoun holes up in a bunker under what used to be the palace
parking lot.
   The two-story, U-shaped palace, perched on a pine-wooded hilltop
east of Beirut, has been a prime target of Syrian gunners. More
than 3,000 shells and rockets have hit the compound.
   Shrapnel from 240mm mortar rounds and 180mm howitzer shells are
displayed on the broken stone steps at the main entrance.
   The large windows have been shattered. Birds fly in and out of
holes in the walls of the spacious banquet hall.
   Aoun, who commands Lebanon's army and heads a Christian cabinet
vying for legitimacy with Moslem rivals, has no illusions that his
20,000 soldiers alone can drive out the 40,000 Syria troops in
Lebanon.
   His strategy has been to force the world to notice Lebanon's
plight, which he believes has been ignored.
   ``For the first time, there is a real awareness of the Lebanese
problem,'' Aoun said in an interview in his bunker.
   ``Where was our cause three months ago? It was dead. We have
brought it back to life,'' he said.
   Three flights of brown-carpeted stairs go down to a small
concrete hall with three corridors leading to cramped living
quarters and a spartan office. It holds two wooden desks, a few
leather chairs and two telephones. A Lebanese flag adorns one wall.
   Aoun's family lived with him there until a fragile cease-fire
May 11, which the Syrians violate daily while Christian guns remain
silent.
   ``We, as a family, are used to rough living,'' Aoun said. ``Many
of the palace staff couldn't get here because of the shelling, so
my daughters helped me. Mireille, for example, worked on the
computer.''
   He sent his wife, Nadia, and their three daughters to the family
home in Rabiyeh, in mountains northeast of Beirut, when the Arab
League called the cease-fire.
   ``I didn't feel they were afraid when they were with me. On the
contrary, I felt I had soldiers with me. ... We ate with the
soldiers,'' he said.
   But the general ``always has a pistol under his pillow,''
according to an aide.
   He said Aoun exercises every morning when he wakes up at 6 a.m.
before an 18-hour work day, and he looked relaxed and fit despite
the constant tension. He eats simply: rice, beans, potatoes and an
occasional steak.
   His crusade and the destruction it has triggered has bred
extreme passions among the 1 million Christians besieged in their
310-square-mile heartland.
   Critics, who believe Aoun's lopsided war will destroy Beirut,
call him ``Napol-Aoun'' because of what they consider delusions of
grandeur and recklessness matching those of the French military
leader and self-proclaimed emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte.
   Others hail Aoun as a hero _ the first Lebanese leader who dare
stand up to Syrian domination.
   ``He's our savior,'' said housewife Mary Keyrouz. ``He's our
Jesus, may God protect him.''

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's performance in the new
Soviet parliament has shown him to be a consummate politician who
relishes conflict and control.
   Ever since he stepped into the international spotlight in London
in December 1984, Gorbachev has proved a master at showing
different faces to different audiences.
   He startled skeptical Soviet citizens weary of 70 years of
Communist Party rule with his ability to take politics into their
streets months after assuming control of the traditionally
secretive Kremlin.
   His smiles and quips and his fashionable wife won admiration and
interest abroad even before his rapid makeover of foreign policy
shot him ahead of domestic leaders in Western opinion polls.
   At the Congress of People's Deputies, he has played different
roles: the strict teacher in his ``school of democracy''; the
genial leader meeting deputies from the provinces; and the
diplomat, brokering deals between bitterly divided ethnic groups.
   Many Soviets, glued to live radio and TV broadcasts of the
proceedings, are less enthusiastic about Gorbachev now than they
were two years ago, grumbling bitterly about the increasing
consumer shortages his reforms have brought.
   But there is virtually universal agreement that Gorbachev is
cunning.
   The 58-year-old Gorbachev's political skill has guided him
through several potential pitfalls in the four years since he took
power and swiftly pledged to restructure Soviet society.
   He hit a snag in the fall of 1987, when an outspoken proponent
of his reforms, Boris N. Yeltsin, overstepped the bounds of party
propriety. Yeltsin, Gorbachev's handpicked Moscow party chief,
criticized the slow pace of reform and named the man he thought was
to blame, fellow Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev.
   Gorbachev, indirectly voicing bitter disappointment with
Yeltsin, joined with Ligachev in removing Yeltsin from the
Politburo and the influential Moscow party post.
   But Yeltsin was allowed to stay at the center of power in the
capital. He was appointed first deputy construction minister.
   From that base, he has made a remarkable political comeback,
winning more than 5 million votes from Muscovites to get a seat in
the Congress.
   Gorbachev called the new Congress into being last summer at a
key conference at which he cleverly won Communist Party support to
reform the political structure.
   Through the Congress, as well as the Supreme Soviet, its
standing legislature, and a new system of legislative oversight
outlined Tuesday, Gorbachev can now _ if he chooses _ create a
structure that would sidestep the party apparatus and central
bureaucracy he says have watered down and blocked his reforms.
   And, through a deft political maneuver Monday, Gorbachev has
Yeltsin in the new legislature, which contains only one Politburo
member, Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, and excludes Ligachev.
   Mindful of the danger of antagonizing conservatives, Gorbachev
is careful not to go too far, too fast with his reforms.
   This has led the volatile, emotional intellectuals that are his
key source of popular support to doubt whether their president
actually wants the kind of radical reform advocated by Yeltsin, who
called Wednesday for the Congress to wrest power from the 20
million-member party.
   Doubts about potentially authoritarian tendencies in the Soviet
leader, who now heads the party and state apparatus, have been
fueled by some of his statements to the Congress.
   Lauding the democracy brought to life in parliamentary debate
Tuesday, Gorbachev added: ``But this does not mean that Gorbachev
does not see. I see everything.''
   Last week, during a televised questioning as the Congress
debated his suitability as president, Gorbachev stressed his
control of the country.
   ``I know that at the back of Moscow buses, there are pictures of
Brezhnev covered with medals and Gorbachev covered with ration
cards,'' he remarked, referring to cartoons mocking Leonid I.
Brezhnev's vainglorious love of awards, and the rationing that
current shortages have brought.
   Some intellectuals also voiced concern with Gorbachev's
virtually undebated pronouncement Tuesday that elections for
republican and local parliaments have been postponed from this fall
to next spring.
   Gorbachev argued that time was needed to iron out difficulties
in electoral laws that emerged from the contested campaign for the
Congress.
   But his move could be a sop to regional party leaders who
complained at a Central Committee meeting in April about elections
the month before to the Congress in which several party chiefs went
down to defeat.
   Whatever Gorbachev's conservative tendencies, the Congress has
confirmed his zest and physical stamina for debate.
   Guiding the Congress through discussions that swing from dull
procedure to crackling exchanges, he displays an excellent memory
for names and faces. When not chairing the sessions, he whispers to
the presiding officers and intervenes to cut off or encourage
discussion.
   He also has an ability to forge compromise. When conflict
threatened to turn one discussion into a shouting match, Gorbachev
urged, ``Let's live as friends.''

   Writer Ales Adamovich says the freedom to question
authority at the Congress of People's Deputies parliament is like a
pole-vault or high-jump contest.
   Each day the level goes higher. Everyone knows there's an upper
limit, but no one knows where it is.
   ``There is no prohibition _ just an ability to jump higher,''
the writer observed after Wednesday's session. ``But you can fall
and break your nose.''
   The session started May 25 with firm but polite questioning of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's privileges, powers, and his right
to be both Communist Party chief and head of state.
   On Tuesday, a former Olympic weightlifter pointedly accused
Gorbachev of holding back information on the military assault on
demonstrators in Tbilisi, Georgia, that killed 19, and he attacked
the feared KGB secret police.
   ``In no circumstances is it possible to accept that the head of
state doesn't know the circumstances of the case,'' said Yuri
Vlasov in reference to the Georgian violence. ``Otherwise, what
kind of head of state is he?''
   Vlasov urged the parliament to add an impeachment article to the
Soviet Constitution, to be imposed for withholding information from
the people.
   Then he attacked the KGB, which he said, is ``the most closed,
the most conspiratorial of all government institutions,''
controlling the lives of its citizens and set above every other
part of the government.
   He received prolonged applause.
   With his policy of glasnost, or greater openness, Gorbachev has
awakened open political debate in society, but the speed at which
Soviets have taken in the changes has startled even some of the
deputies.
   Gorbachev sought to reassure them the give-and-take of
parliamentary debate is a normal part of a more democratic system,
even if deputies occasionally lose their tempers.
   The deputies, whose performances were broadcast back home on TV,
took the opportunity to talk about their constituents' pet peeves.
   Boris N. Yeltsin criticized Gorbachev on Wednesday in what
amounted to an alternate policy address.
   The Communist maverick told reporters his speech would have been
impossible three years ago but may have been acceptable a year or
year and a half ago.
   Adamovich, a political reformer famous for his tales of World
War II horrors in Byelorussia, said the 2,250 deputies had become
more aggressive in their speeches and criticism.
   The rhetoric peaked last Saturday in a pitched battle between
reformers and conservatives over the makeup of the working
legislature, the Supreme Soviet. Historian Yuri Afanasyev said the
reformers were being oppressed by an ``aggressively obedient''
majority.
   Adamovich said he noticed from the Congress floor that the
rhetoric peaked again Tuesday in a sharp debate that included the
military commander of the Tbilisi assault, the former Communist
Party chief and a member of a commission that called the assault a
``planned mass massacre.''
   Lt. Col. Igor Rodionov, the military commander, said the
protesters were expressing separatist slogans and insulting
Russians and other non-Georgians.
   Commission member Thomas Gamkrelidze said in an interview
Wednesday that although debate in the Congress is freer, the
Tbilisi assault demonstrated that level of openness has not reached
the entire country.
   ``I think Rodionov's speech here has shown the whole world that
it is enough to raise slogans here to be punished or killed,'' he
said.
   ``Our democracy has not reached the point to realize that it is
not permissible to punish people for slogans. Gorbachev seems to be
more liberal in this respect than others, including the military.''

<TEXT>
   Dr. Charles Anthony Hufnagel, a cardiac
surgeon who pioneered the artificial heart valve, died on Wednesday
at Sibley Memorial Hospital. He was 72.
   Hufnagel implanted the first artificial heart valve in a human
patient at Georgetown University Medical School in 1952.
   In 1947, he also participated in the first human kidney
transplant at Boston's Peter Bent Brigham Hospital.
   The heart valve developed by Hufnagel involved the insertion of
a plastic valve into a damaged artery. A plastic ball forced the
valve to open and close, permitting blood to flow into and out of
the heart as it would through a normal artery.
   Since then artificial heart valves have changed, but Hufnagel's
design and procedure were considered major medical milestones.
   From 1969 to 1979 Hufnagel was chairman of the surgery
department at Georgetown's medical school.
   At his death, he was a professor of surgery at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences at Bethesda, Md., and
clinical professor of surgery at George Washington University.

   Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has
been named the first recipient of the Philadelphia Liberty Medal.
   The honor, announced Wednesday, was for his contributions in
making Poland's labor movement ``the precursor of a new sense of
democracy'' worldwide.
   The medal and $100,000 that goes with it will be presented to
Walesa's wife, Danuta, and son Yaroslaw in ceremonies at
Independence Hall on July 4, said Willard G. Rouse III, chairman of
We the People 2000.
   Rouse, speaking in Independence Park on Wednesday, said he met
with the solidarity leader Monday in Gdansk, Poland.
   Walesa, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, said he would
be unable to accept the award in person because ``he felt compelled
to be in Poland in that critical time'' following Polish elections
in June, according to Rouse.

   Jurors have sided with celebrity
divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson in a $7 million civil suit filed
by a woman who claimed the attorney raped and assaulted her in his
office.
   The jury returned the verdict Wednesday just 3{ hours after
beginning deliberations.
   ``I am very pleased that the system works,'' Mitchelson said at
the conclusion of the seven-day Superior Court trial.
   Patricia French filed suit in 1983 alleging that Mitchelson
raped her three times at his Century City office in 1981 while she
was a client. She also alleged he failed to return a $5,000
retainer fee.
   She never told police of the incident and the Los Angeles County
district attorney and state attorney general declined to prosecute
when she contacted the office years later.
   Mitchelson has represented such star clients as Joan Collins and
Bianca Jagger in divorce cases and was the lawyer in the landmark

   Champion professional wrestler Hulk Hogan told
dozens of special education youngsters that his battles in the ring
with King Kong Bundy and Big John Studd were nothing compared to
battles in real life.
   Hogan warned students in two public schools not to take drugs
and to stay in school.
   ``The toughest fight of all is real life,'' he said. ``It's the
adults who sometimes have a hard time with it.''
   Hogan was chosen the favorite hero of 100 children with speech,
hearing or other learning disabilities at the two schools. The
children picked Hogan in April and wrote letters asking him to
visit.
   On Wednesday, he did, and the youngsters showered him with
praise.
   ``He's a hero to us and everybody loves him like a father,''
13-year-old Quincy Brown said after an hour of skits in a Manhattan
school auditorium.
   Hogan's eyes became misty.
   ``I about started crying here,'' he told the students.

   Actor Michael J. Fox and his actress-wife
Tracy Pollan are parents of a baby boy.
   The newborn, Sam Michael Fox, and his parents are doing fine,
the actor's publicist Nancy Ryder said Wednesday.
   The baby was born Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center under
cloak of secrecy.
   ``They came in under different names early Tuesday and left
early Wednesday,'' said hospital spokesman Ron Wise. ``The baby was
healthy. Mom was healthy.''
   Fox, 27, has been pestered by a woman accused of sending more
than 5,000 letters to the actor threatening him, his wife and
unborn child with death. The woman has been charged with five
counts of making terrorist threats and was being held without bail
in Los Angeles, facing an arraignment Monday.
   Fox and Miss Pollan, 28, co-starred on TV's ``Family Ties'' and
in the film ``Bright Lights, Big City.'' Fox's credits also include
the 1985 film ``Back to the Future.''

   With nearly $1 million in scholarship
offers, Chris Vuturo had the luxury of choice when it came time to
pick a college.
   Valedictorian, civic volunteer, newspaper columnist, athlete _
Vuturo had a perfect 4.0 grade-point average at De Sales High
School. He scored 33 out of a possible 36 on the American College
Test and a combined 1,350 out of a possible 1,600 on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test.
   ``He was always thinking ahead of us _ teachers as well as
students,'' said Tony Medley, who was Vuturo's journalism teacher.
   He applied to numerous colleges and received scholarships and
invitations to attend Harvard University, the University of
Southern California, the U.S. Air Force Academy, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Columbia University, Boston University,
and Georgetown University, among others.
   All told, he said, he was offered $885,782 worth of
scholarships, based on current tuition rates.
   He had dreamed about aeronautical engineering since childhood.
Then he started working for the student newspaper and thought about
pursuing a career in journalism. Lately, he's been thinking about a
combination of genetics and law.
   Vuturo decided on Harvard, thinking it would give him room to
explore some or all those fields. The scholarship package from
Harvard is worth about $68,000 over four years, and that plus some
of his own savings would cover about three-quarters of the cost.
   The rest will come from other scholarships, including a National
Merit Scholarship and a Jefferson County Farm Bureau Scholarship.
   Teachers and students describe Vuturo as a ferocious competitor
in the classroom. But they also said he's among the first to
volunteer to tutor other students.
   ``I always saw his presence in the class as a positive catalyst
to other students,'' said Richard Knoop, who taught him biology and
German.
   Vuturo is the youngest of six children of Salvador and Jean
Vuturo. The Vuturos said Chris, who received a partial scholarship
to attend the Roman Catholic high school, couldn't have gone to
college without aid.

<HEAD>US Retaliates By Expelling Two Nicaraguan Envoys</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf 1st Ld: ``In Managua,'' with 4 grafs to give Ortega
comment.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Nicaraguan diplomats who arrived here just
10 days ago were ordered home by the State Department on Wednesday
in retaliation for the expulsion of two American envoys from
Managua last week.
   At the same time, the department expressed interest in improving
bilateral relations and said it would respond positively to
concrete steps the Sandinista government may take toward democracy.
   The Nicaraguan Embassy was informed that Roberto Vargas and
William Vigil, both minister counselors, were given 72 hours to
leave U.S. territory, State Department deputy spokesman Richard
Boucher said.
   In Managua, President Daniel Ortega promised a ``hard hand'' for
foreigners he believes are meddling in his country's internal
affairs.
   ``The U.S. government should be clear that we will not let them
be here if they show disrepect for the country,'' Ortega said at a
meeting of some 1,200 teachers representing educators nationwide
who are seeking a salary incrase.
   Ortega's statements were made in response to the expulsions in
Washington.
   Ortega said two U.S. diplomats ordered to leave Managua last
week tried to use the teachers' discontent to ``manipulate the
unjust demands of the teachers.''
   Vargas and Vigil arrived in Washington last week as part of a
plan by both the U.S. and Nicaraguan governments to replenish their
respective diplomatic staffs in each other's country.
   The staffs had been decimated last July when Managua ordered
eight American envoys home and Washington responded by expelling
eight Nicaraguan diplomats.
   The agreement by the two countries to send replacement envoys
was reached only a few weeks ago.
   Last week, the Sandinista government expelled U.S. Embassy
economic attache Joel Cassman and a visiting U.S. labor attache
based in Honduras, Kathleen Barmon, on grounds they had incited
Nicaraguan teachers to join a wildcat strike. Cassman had arrived
in Managua just a few days before Vargas and Vigil assumed their
duties in Washington.
   At the time the Americans were expelled, the State Department
denied they had engaged in improper activities. Boucher said
Wednesday the department waited six days in hopes the Sandinista
government would reverse the decision.
   The expulsion was ordered only after it became clear that the
Sandinista decision was final, Boucher said. Nicaraguan Embassy
spokeswoman Cecilia Lopez declined comment on the U.S. action.
   Boucher called the Sandinista allegations against the Americans
``false, absurd and not worthy of further comment.''
   He added that the expulsion of the Americans was intended to
draw attention away from the ``dissatisfaction of Nicaraguan
workers with Sandinista economic policies and to deflect
responsibility for this unrest from the Nicaraguan government.''
   Still, Boucher used the occasion of Wednesday's announcement to
discuss the possibility of genuine accommodation between the two
countries.
   If the Sandinista government takes ``concrete steps'' toward
holding free and fair presidential elections tentatively set for
Feb. 25, the United States is willing ``to respond positively,'' he
said.
   ``In the wake of these events, we hope that all interested
parties will redouble their efforts to bring true democracy and
authentic national reconciliation to Nicaragua via the electoral
process.''
   Previously, the State Department had criticized new electoral
and media laws approved in Nicaragua as unfair to opposition
parties but Boucher made no reference to that issue Wednesday.

   It turns out that President Bush
knows how to play poker _ by his own rules. Bush waited for the
Soviet Union to raise twice before he even put his arms control
ante on the table.
   Then the president upped the stakes, called the hand, and said
the next move was Moscow's.
   In his debut at the western summit, Bush claimed a double hit,
proposing conventional arms limitations he said would transform the
military map of Europe, and gaining a compromise on his terms to
settle West Germany's unwelcome demand for immediate negotiations
aimed at reducing short-range nuclear missiles.
   After a quick, aerial commute from Brussels to Bonn on Tuesday,
he assured the Germans that they were happy about it. What's more,
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed, and said the president's
overnight visit would be a major political plus as he seeks to
defend his leadership in elections next year.
   The administration's concern is that negotiations on short-range
nuclear missiles might bring pressure to eliminate those weapons,
just as Moscow and Washington agreed in 1987 to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Bush and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III both said, and repeated, that there can be only
partial reduction in short-range missiles, that they will be needed
for the foreseeable future to offset Eastern bloc manpower in
Europe.
   In any event, the missile negotiations are not even to begin
until there is a pact on reduction of conventional arms in Europe.
That will not satisfy Kohl's opposition on the left, even though
the chancellor said the compromise made everyone a winner.
   To ease any political sting, Bush, who faced U.S. criticism and
pressure of his own for going slowly on arms control, spoke of that
problem Wednesday in a speech in Mainz.
   ``To those who are impatient with our measured pace in arms
reductions, I respectfully suggest that history teaches us a lesson
_ that unity and strength are the catalyst and prerequisite to arms
control,'' the president said.
   ``Europe is the most heavily armed continent in the world,'' he
said. ``Nowhere is this more apparent than in the two Germanys.
That is why our quest to safely reduce armaments has a special
significance for the German people.''
   That quest had been on hold since Bush took office, pending, he
said, a review of foreign and defense policies. Even when the
administration pronounced study time over, the speeches in which
Bush described his plans were relatively pallid, short on drama,
hardly a comeback to the peace offensive of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev had announced one set of conventional arms cuts,
proposed terms for negotiations on another, and threw in a
unilateral cut of 500 short-range nuclear weapons. Bush held his
cards and kept his poker face, although the administration welcomed
Soviet arms cut proposals that were offered 10 days ago, saying
they held promise and moved toward the goals of the western allies.
   Moscow now has called the Bush-NATO proposals to limit troops
and weapons a positive step, suggesting at the same time that
conventional arms cuts should cover everything. The Bush plan
doesn't mention naval forces in the European theater.
   While Bush said he'd known where he was going all along, there
had been evidence of White House frustration at Gorbachev's success
in dominating the debate.
   According to the administration, the Bush proposals for
conventional arms cuts began to take their final form after
discussions at his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, over a long
weekend visit that began May 18. Administration emissaries were
sent to NATO capitals to talk about the arms reduction proposal,
brief allied leaders, and build a consensus.
   Baker said the arms cut plan was shaped ``on a separate track,''
apart from the policy review.
   ``All the various bureaucracies in the federal government that
have to consider these things ultimately considered this
proposal,'' Baker said. ``But it wasn't put into the general
review; it was dealt with at a higher level in the government.''
   Finally, on Monday, Bush was ready, unveiling at NATO his call
for cuts to 275,000 U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe, with ceilings
on tanks, artillery and combat aircraft as well. It built on both
Western and Soviet proposals. And Bush proposed that it all be done
about five years faster than Gorbachev suggested.
   While Bush said he'd been immune to all the criticism, the
charges that he was a do-nothing leader, he acted as though a cloud
had been lifted.
   The president said it showed the way he intends to lead the
allies and the free world.
   Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers was said to have told the
summit ``the experts may not be happy with this, but as a
politician, I think it's the right thing to do.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain called it
clear, quality leadership. But she said that never had been in
doubt, even when Bush was taking what he called a hammering for
failing to respond to Gorbachev.
   ``I much prefer a leader to be measured rather than dashing into
things,'' she said.
   No more poker face.

   Vice President Dan Quayle will make his second
trip to Central America June 11-14, on a mission to encourage
democratic freedoms under El Salvador's new government and
intensify opposition to Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega,
Quayle's office announced today.
   Quayle will travel to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa
Rica, the four U.S. allies in the region, and meet with each
country's president. He also will meet with leaders of the
U.S.-backed Contra rebel movement that opposes the leftist
government of Nicaragua, Quayle aides said.
   In El Salvador, where the newly elected president, Alfredo
Cristiani, was being inaugurated today, Quayle also will meet with
military leaders. He is expected to underscore the pro-human rights
message he delivered during a visit there in February.
   Quayle's journey will come after a special delegation reports
June 6 to the Organization of American States on its recent mission
to Panama.
   The diplomats from Trinidad, Guatemala and Costa Rica ended four
days of talks aimed at finding a solution to the political crisis
stemming from May 7 elections that were widely seen as having been
rigged by Noriega.
   The United States condemned Noriega, beefed up its troop
presence in Panama and urged allies in the hemisphere to isolate
the general.
   Quayle is expected to rally U.S. allies in the anti-Noriega
effort.
   Although the OAS team has not issued its report, there are no
indications the country is any closer to resolving its situation,
in which Noriega ultimately invalidated the election results.
   Quayle aides did not disclose where the vice president would
meet with the Contras, whose troops are encamped inside Honduras
near the Nicaraguan border.
   The Bush administration is providing non-lethal aid to the
Contras to keep their forces in place for a year while the Central
American countries work on a diplomatic solution to the Contra war.
   In El Salvador, Quayle's visit will serve to underscore support
for Cristiani at a time when some Congress members have expressed
concerns about continuing U.S. aid to that country because of the
ties between his rightist political party, Arena, and past death
squad activity.
   Quayle and other U.S. officials, however, say Cristiani deserves
a chance to prove he is committed to democracy and the pro-human
rights government he has promised.
   ``Our reading is they've been pretty responsible to date. It is
a situation we've got to keep our eyes on,'' said one
administration official.
   Quayle's meeting with Salvadoran military officials is not
expected to carry the stern tone of his previous message.
   His earlier visit, the first foreign trip of the newly
inaugurated Bush administration, was to highlight U.S. attention to
the region and to warn El Salvador that the country's daily $1.5
million in U.S. military and economic aid would be in jeopardy
unless there was a crackdown on human rights violations by the
military and civilian groups.
   The Bush administration and Congress recently worked out what
officials said was a tentative agreement to continue U.S. military
aid to El Salvador while taking into account congressional concerns
about a rightist resurgence there.
   Some lawmakers also complain an end to El Salvador's civil war
is no closer although the United States poured out more than $3.5
billion in aid since the early 1980s. Marxist-led guerrillas have
been battling the Salvadoran government since 1979.
   The Bush administration fought off congressional moves to
sharply cut back aid to El Salvador. But in recent negotiations for
inclusion of new assistance in foreign aid legislation, Democrats
won some concessions from the administration, congressional and
administration sources said.
   The talks produced agreement for annual military aid of $85
million, the same figure as this year.
   The agreement called for an administration report at six-month
intervals on El Salvador's protection of human rights and progress
on a negotiated settlement to the rebel war.

   Here are excerpts from House Speaker Jim
Wright's statement Wednesday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   For 34 years I have had the great privilege to be a member of
this institution, the people's house, and I shall forever be
grateful for that wondrous privilege.
   I never cease to be thankful to the people of the 12th District
of Texas for their friendship and their understanding and their
partiality toward me.
   Eighteen times they have voted to permit me the grand privilege
of representing them here in this depository of the democratic
principle.
   Only a few days ago, even in face of harsh news accounts and
bitter criticisms they indicated in a poll taken by the leading
newspaper in the district that 78 percent of them approved of my
services ...
   And you, my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, ... have
given me the greatest gift within your power to give. To be the
speaker of the United States House of Representatives is the
grandest opportunity that can come to any lawmaker anywhere in the
Western world.
   I am proud of a number of the things that we have done together
while you have let me be your speaker. ... For your help, your
great work, and for permitting me to be a part of this institution
while that was happening, I thank you. ...
   And I love this institution. ... And I want to assure each of
you that under no circumstances, having spent more than half of my
life here, this House being my home, would I ever knowingly or
intentionally do or say anything to violate its rules or detract
from its standards.
   Now all of us are prone to human error. ... For over a year ...
I have ached to tell my side of the story. ... Today, silence is no
longer tolerable; nor for the good of the House is it even
desirable. ... I owe it to you and to the American people to give a
straightforward answer ... I'm convinced that I'm right; maybe I'm
wrong.
   I know that each of us, as Benjamin Franklin suggested, should
be careful to doubt a little his own infallibility. ...
   And so let's look at (each of the charges made) one by one,
dispassionately.
   Did my wife Betty's employment, at $18,000 a year for some four
years, by a small investment corporation which she and I formed
with friends of ours, George and Marlene Mallick, and the attendant
benefits of that employment _ use of an apartment when she was in
Fort Worth on company business and the use of a company-owned car _
constitute merely a sham and a subterfuge and a gift from our
friend Mr. Mallick?
   Was Betty's employment and those things related to it a gift?
   ... Why was Betty working for the corporation? ...
   George Mallick, my partner, was too busy looking into his own
interests. ... Marlene Mallick was raising family. ... I was busy
being a member of Congress, and majority leader. I didn't have any
time to spend on it. Betty alone among all of us had the time and
the opportunity, and the experience and the desire to give effort
and energy to exploring and promoting investment opportunities.
   She did indeed perform work, and it paid off for the little
corporation. ... She advised as to when was a good time to sell
(stocks), when was a good time to buy and the corporation made some
money ... Betty paid for her salary several times over.
   She maintained very frequent contract with a drilling company
... in West Texas in which each of the four partners had an
interest ... She went to New York and studied the gem stone
business ... She looked into other prospective investments ...

   (Wrights offers for the record affidavits from five individuals
who attest that Mrs. Wright earned her $18,000 salary.)
   ... The outside counsel employed by the committee has suggested
that Mrs. Wright's employment somehow amounted to a gift. ...
   Does he want so many pages of canceled shorthand notes? So many
pages of typed manuscript? She wasn't a carpenter. Is a woman's
mental study and her time and her advice not to be counted as a
work product? ...
   For most of her adult life Mrs. Wright has been a business
person, been an officer in a large hotel, an officer in a
successful real estate and construction firm, a professional staff
person on a congressional committee.
   She was making more than $18,000 when she worked at the
congressional committee.
   And here's the irony. The supreme irony.
   In 1976, when I was elected majority leader, Betty voluntarily
left her job as a prfessional staff person on the committee so as
to avoid any criticism ...
   Now it just seems to me there isn't any justification at all for
anybody's even raising questions about whether she earned her
$18,000 a year. ... Betty (also) had the use of a company car. That
is true, she did. ...
   I want to do the right thing, the honorable thing.
   I bought and paid for that car out of my personal funds. ...
What more can I do. Does that make it right?
   Now concerning the apartment ... We didn't think there was
anything wrong with paying a per diem rate. ... We paid on a daily
basis for our use of that apartment. ...
   Nevertheless, last year I said to George Mallick, I said, I want
to buy the apartment. ... I paid the amount suggested and appraised
by two real estate persons in Fort Worth, $58,000. ... I just
wanted to clear the air and remove doubts and say if we've made a
mistake we've done what we can to set things right. I don't think
we've violated any rules. ...
   The second alleged violation continues on the assumption ...
that George Mallick, our friend and business partner, had a direct
interest in influencing legislation, which would make it illegal
for us to accept gifts from him.
   ... I've known this man for more than 25 years. He's been my
friend ... Never once in all the years that I've known this man has
he ever asked me to vote for or against any piece of legislation.
...
   Not one time has he ever asked me to intercede with any
administrative agency of government on behalf of him or of any
institution in which he has an interest. ...
   Now the only other basic question, it's just one that remains,
in the statement of alleged violations, concerns the sale of a
book, a little book now you'll recall ``Reflections of a Public
Man'' which I wrote and which was sold sometimes in bulk quantities.
   People who took it and gave it away to other people _ students,
newspapers, public officials and members of their organizations.
   And I wanted them to. I wanted to get the widest possible
distribution of the book. ...
   Now, the contention ... is that this book project ... on which I
got $3.25 for every book that sold was a kind of a sham and a
subterfuge itself and an overall scheme for me to exceed and
violate the outside earnings limitation of a member of Congress. ...
   If monetary gain had been my primary interest, don't you think I
would have gone to one of the big Madison Avenue publications, the
houses there that give you a big advance?
   It is true I think that people on my staff were eager to sell
these books. They knew I wanted them sold. I've got to accept some
responsibility for that if it was wrong, but the rule doesn't say
it was wrong. ...The rules expressly exempt royalty income. ... I
didn't intend to try to violate the outside earning limitations and
I don't believe legally that I did. ...

   (Wright maintains during a lenghty discourse that details of the
book deal were erroneously characterized by the outside counsel
investigating the matter for the ethics committee. He suggests the
process of ethics investigations needs improvement.)
   Maybe the whole process needs some change and clarification. ...
Maybe the committee that is currently required to sit as a kind of
grand jury and petit jury both, ought to have a different
composition. ... Maybe once a report of alleged violations is
issued, the committee rules ought to allow the member to respond
expeditiously.
   You know, to deny a member the opportunity to reply quickly can
cause serious political injury. It is unfair. ... In my case, for
example, the committee has yet to release any witness testimony or
documents that it obtained during the investigation. ...
   Perhaps we want to consider outright abolition of all honoraria,
speaking fees, altogether. ... In exchange for a straightforward,
honest increase in the salary for members of all three branches of
the government.
   It is intolerably hurtful to our government that qualified
members of the executive and legislative branches are resigning
because of ambiguities and confusion surrounding the ethics laws,
and because of their own consequent vulnerability to personal
attack.
   That's a shame.
   It's happening.
   And it is grievously hurtful to our society.
   When vilification becomes an accepted form of political debate,
when negative campaigning becomes a fulltime occupation, when
members of each party become self-appointed vigilantes carrying out
personal vendettas against members of the other party, in God's
name that is not what this institution is supposed to be all about.
   When vengeance becomes more desirable than vindication, harsh
personal attacks upon one another's motives and one another's
character drown out the quiet logic of serious debate on important
issues, things that we ought to be involved ourselves in, surely
that is unworthy of our institution, unworthy of our American
political process.
   All of us, in both political parties, must resolve to bring this
period of mindless cannibalism to an end.
   There has been enough of it. ...
   When I first came here all those years ago in 1955 this was a
place where a man's word was his bond and his honor and truth of
what he said to you were assumed. You didn't have to prove it. ...
   Now, we need that.
   Have I made mistakes?
   Oh, boy, how many!
   I made a lot of mistakes.
   Mistakes in judgment, oh, yeah.
   A lot of them.
   I'll make some more. ...
   Have I contributed unwittingly to this manic idea of a frenzy of
feeding on other people's reputations?
   Have I at all caused a lot of this?
   So maybe I have. God, I hope I haven't, but maybe I have.
   Have I been too partisan?
   Too insistent?
   Too abrasive?
   Too determined to have my way?
   Perhaps.
   Maybe so.

   If I have offended anybody in the other party, I'm sorry.
   I never meant to, would not have done so intentionally.
   I always tried to treat all of our colleagues, Democrats and
Republicans, with respect.
   Are there things I would do differently if I had them to do over
again?
   Oh, boy, how many may I name for you?
   Well, I tell you what: I'm going to make you a proposition.
   Let me give you back this job you gave to me as a propitiation
for all of this season of bad will that has grown up among us; give
it back to you.
   I will resign as speaker of the House effective upon the
election of my successor and I'll ask that we call a caucus on the
Democratic side for next Tuesday to choose a successor.
   I don't want to be a party to tearing up the institution.
   I love it.
   To tell you the truth, this year, it has been very difficult for
me to offer the kind of moral leadership that the organization
needs because every time I have tried to talk about the needs of
the country ... the media have not been interested in that. They
wanted to ask me about petty personal finances.
   You need somebody else.
   So I want to give you that back.
   We'll have a caucus on Tuesday.
   And then, I will offer to resign from the House sometime before
the end of June.
   Let that be a total payment for the anger and hostility that we
feel for each other.
   Let's not try to get even with each other.
   Republicans, please don't get in your heads you need to get
somebody else because of John Tower.
   Democrats, please don't feel you need to get somebody on the
other side because of me.
   We ought to be more mature than that.
   Let's restore to this institution the rightful priorities of
what is good for this country. ... The nation has important
business and it can't afford these distractions, and that is why I
offer to resign. ...
   I am not a bitter man.
   I am not going to be.
   I am a lucky man.
   God has given me the privilege of serving in this, the greatest
institution on Earth, for a great many years, and I am grateful to
the people of my district in Texas, I am grateful to my colleagues,
all of you.
   God bless this institution.
   God bless the United States.

<HEAD>Study Finds AIDS-Infected People May Elude Blood Screening Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some people infected with the AIDS virus may elude
screening tests intended to protect blood banks because they
produce no telltale antibodies against the lethal virus for years,
researchers reported today.
   Widely used screening tests cannot see the AIDS virus directly.
Instead, they search for antibodies that people produce as part of
their natural reaction to infection.
   The latest work, however, found that some people produce no
antibodies, even though they have been infected for years with HIV,
the AIDS virus. Therefore, the AIDS tests are useless against their
blood.
   In an editorial published with the study in the New England
Journal of Medicine, Dr. William A. Haseltine of Boston's
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute cautioned that the research ``raises
the sobering possibility that HIV-1 infections may be transmitted
by blood and organ donors who are silently infected.''
   Dr. David T. Imagawa, who directed the study at the University
of California, Los Angeles, agreed that people with such latent
infections might pass on the virus. He added that homosexuals
``should continue to refrain from donating blood.''
   However, at the American Association of Blood Banks, Dr. Amoz
Chernoff downplayed the importance of the discovery to the nation's
blood banks.
   Chernoff noted that the study was conducted in homosexual men
who had high-risk sexual practices. If such people gave blood, they
probably would also be infected with the hepatitis virus, so their
blood would be screened out by other tests.
   ``The relevance of these data to the blood banks is probably
negligible,'' he said, ``but this will be followed to make sure it
doesn't have an impact.''
   Antibody screening of large population groups also is used to
gauge how many people are infected with HIV. The U.S. Centers for
Disease Control estimates that between 1 million and 1.5 million
Americans carry the virus.
   The new research ``means that the infection could be
considerably more widespread than we anticipated,'' Haseltine said
in an interview.
   The work shows that HIV can permanently insert itself into the
genes of blood cells but stay hidden so the body never attacks it
with antibodies. People may make no AIDS antibodies for three years
_ and perhaps much longer _ after they become infected.
   While the study raises concern about the effectiveness of
current screening tests, there is also a bright side to the finding.
   ``The good news is that at least some fraction of people, when
exposed, seem to control the infection,'' said Haseltine. ``We
would guess that as long as it stays in that controlled state,
people are going to stay healthy. It gives us a new target to shoot
for in terms of therapy.''
   The research was based on 1,637 homosexual men in Los Angeles.
Among them were 133 men who had no AIDS antibodies but continued to
engage in anal sex. In test tubes, their white blood cells were
stimulated to grow. This released any AIDS virus hidden inside the
cells so it could be detected.
   They found that 31 of the 133 had silent AIDS infections. While
four eventually began to produce AIDS antibodies, the rest did not
for followup periods up to three years.
   How long this quiet state of infection may last is unclear,
although researchers speculated it might be lifelong for some
people.
   ``There is a distinct possibility that in spite of their
infection they never may go on to get AIDS,'' Imagawa said.

<HEAD>Tracing Speaker's Ethics Problem From Gingrich Complaint</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Wright</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of the controversy over
alleged ethics violations by House Speaker Jim Wright, who
announced Wednesday he would surrender the leadership post and his
congressional seat.
   May 26, 1988 _ Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., files a formal
complaint with the House ethics committee asking for an
investigation to determine whether Wright violated House ethics
rules.
   June 2, 1988 _ The ethics panel begins considering whether to
launch an investigation.
   June 10, 1988 _ The ethics committee decides to conduct an
official inquiry into the accusations against Wright, marking only
the second time since the panel was created in 1967 that it has
investigated a speaker of the House.
   July 26, 1988 _ Richard J. Phelan, a Chicago attorney and an
active Democratic fund-raiser, is chosen by the ethics committee to
lead the Wright probe.
   Sept. 14, 1988 _ Wright testifies under oath before the ethics
committee for the first time and gives a lengthy defense of his
conduct.
   Jan. 3, 1989 _ Wright is re-elected Speaker of the House.
   Feb. 22, 1989 _ The independent counsel investigating Wright's
conduct turns over a voluminous final report to the ethics panel.
   Feb. 23, 1989 _ The ethics committee begins a closed-door review
of the counsel's findings.
   April 4, 1989 _ The ethics panel takes a break from weeks of
deliberation to re-open the investigative phase by taking
depositions from a Fort Worth business partner of Wright, developer
George Mallick, and a chairman of a Florida savings bank, Richard
Swann.
   April 12, 1989 _ A source familiar with the probe says the
ethics committee found ``reason to believe'' Wright improperly
accepted gifts from Mallick and sought to evade outside income
limits through bulk sales of his book.
   April 13, 1989 _ Wright mounts an emotional counteroffensive
against the ethics charges and declares he will ``fight to the last
ounce of conviction and energy that I possess.''
   April 17, 1989 _ The ethics committee charges Wright with 69
violations of House rules of conduct.
   May 9, 1989 _ Wright attacks Phelan, the ethics panel's outside
counsel, accusing him of distorting testimony in an effort to
implicate the speaker on rules violations.
   May 23, 1989 _ Wright's defense opens before a national
television audience with this lawyer, Stephen Susman, urging the
ethics panel to ``stand in the way of the lynch mob'' seeking the
speaker's resignation.
   May 24, 1989 _ Wright's lawyers broach the possibility of Wright
resigning his leadership post in exchange for the dismissal of some
of the ethics charges against him.
   May 31, 1989 _ Wright announces to the House his decision to
resign as speaker effective on the election of his successor, and
resign his House seat as well.

   Here is a transcript of House Speaker Jim
Wright's statement Wednesday.
   Mr. Speaker, for 34 years I have had the great privilege to be a
member of this institution, the people's house, and I shall forever
be grateful for that wonderous privilege.
   I never cease to be thankful to the people of the 12th District
of Texas for their friendship and their understanding and their
partiality toward me.
   Eighteen times they have voted to permit me the grand privilege
of representing them here in this depository of the democratic
principle.
   Only a few days ago, even in face of harsh news accounts and
bitter criticisms they indicated in a poll taken by the leading
newspaper in the district that 78 percent of them approved of my
services and that includes 73 percent of the Republicans in my
district and I am very proud of that.
   And you, my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, I owe a great
deal to you.
   You have given me the greatest gift within your power to give.
   To be the speaker of the United States House of Representatives
is the grandest opportunity that can come to any lawmaker anywhere
in the Western world.
   And I would be deeply remiss if I didn't express my sincere
appreciation to you for that opportunity.
   I hope that I have reflected credit upon the people of my
district who know me best, perhaps, and upon the people of this
House who, next to them, who know me best.
   I am proud of a number of the things that we have done together
while you have let me be your speaker.
   I am proud of the record of the 100th Congress.
   Many people feel that it is the most responsive and most
productive Congress in perhaps 25 years.
   All of you who were here in that Congress had a part in that.
   Many of the things we did were truly bipartisan in character.
   Together, we made it possible for great leaps forward to be made
in such things as our competitiveness in the world.
   Together, we fashioned the beginnings of a truly effective war
on drugs to stamp out that menace to the streets and schools and
homes of our nation.
   We began the effort to help the homeless. We still have work to
do to make housing affordable to low-income Americans so that there
won't be any homeless in this country.
   We did things to help abate catastrophic illness, provide
welfare reform legislation, clean water legislation and a great
many other things that I shall not detail.
   For your help, your great work, and for permitting me to be a
part of this institution while that was happening, I thank you.
   And I shall forever be grateful for your cooperation.
   And I love this institution.
   And I want to assure each of you that under no circumstances,
having spent more than half of my life here, this House being my
home, would I ever knowingly or intentionally do or say anything to
violate its rules or detract from its standards.
   Now all of us are prone to human error.
   The speaker of the House is in fact the chief enforcer of the
rules of the House.
   It's really a wonderful thing that any member of the House may,
at his will, bring question against any other member, and under our
rules that has to be looked into.
   And I have no quarrel with that, nor any criticism of people who
have served on the committee on standards.
   It's a thankless job and you have to have such things.
   For over a year, well, just about a year, I have ached to tell
my side of the story.
   That to which I have to respond keeps changing.
   But today, silence is no longer tolerable; nor for the good of
the House is it even desirable.
   So without any rancor and without any bitterness or any hard
feelings toward anybody, I thank you for indulging me as I answer
to you and to the American people for my honor, my reputation and
all the things I've tried to stand for all these years.
   The past year, while the committee on standards has had these
matters under advisement, I have ached for the opportunity to speak.
   Almost daily I besought them to let me come and answer whatever
questions they had on their mind.
   Finally, on the 14th of September, they gave me one day in which
to do that.
   I gratefully went and spent the whole morning and the whole
afternoon answering as candidly and freely as possibly I could any
questions that anyone would ask and I believe when I left everyone
was reasonably well satisfied.
   Suffice to say that the five original charges that had been
lodged were dropped, dismissed.

<TEXT>
   In their place, however, came three additional charges.
   Some said 69.
   The 69 are merely a matter of multiple counting of the three.
   In April, the committee said, well, they thought there was some
reason to believe that rules may have been violated in these three
basic areas.
   I owe it to you and to the American people to give a
straightforward answer on those three areas.
   I'm convinced that I'm right; maybe I'm wrong.
   I know that each of us, as Benjamin Franklin suggested, should
be careful to doubt a little his own infallibility.
   But before those charges were issued, as press leaks filtered
out almost daily, tarnishing my reputation, and, by inference,
spilling over onto the reputation of this institution, I pleaded
for the privilege to come and answer those questions before charges
were made.
   Under the rules, that was not permitted to me, and they were
formally made.
   And so let's look at it, one by one, dispassionately.
   The committee has raised these three basic questions. Doesn't
say that there's clear and convincing proof that I violated the
rules, doesn't say that they know that I violated the rules. It
said they have some reason to believe I may have. And for these
last few weeks I've been trying to refine that and get an
opportunity to address it.
   Now's the day. I'm going to do it now.
   The three questions are these.
   Did my wife Betty's employment, at $18,000 a year for some four
years, by a small investment corporation which she and I formed
with friends of ours, George and Marlene Mallick, and the attendant
benefits of that employement _ use of an apartment when she was in
Fort Worth on company business and the use of a company-owned car _
constitute merely a sham and a subterfuge and a gift from our
friend Mr. Mallick? Was Betty's employment and those things related
to it a gift?
   You've read in papers the suggestion made by committee counsel
that I may have received up to $145,000 in gifts from my friend Mr.
Mallick. Half of it, $72,000, was Betty's income, Betty's salary.
The other half involved the use of a car and the use of an
apartment on a per diem basis.
   Whether it's right or wrong, let's look at it. Betty's
employment. Was that a gift?
   First question I should like to, I suppose you might be asking,
why was Betty working for the corporation? Why did we put her to
work at $18,000 a year? The answer is really very simple.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Release Jailed Mother</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman, who was jailed after her husband took
their 4-year-old son from a hospital where he was undergoing
court-ordered treatment for luekemia, was cited for contempt of
court and denied release Wednesday.
   Family Court Judge Leon Deutsch said he didn't believe the
mother, Migdalia Pagan, when she said she didn't know the
whereabouts of her husband and son.
   Deutsch said Mrs. Pagan, 35, would be brought from a city jail,
where she has been held since Tuesday, to his courtroom daily until
the boy was returned.
   ``My plea is to the mother and the father if he can hear me. If
he comes forward and produces the child, I will order her release
forthwith,'' Deutsch said at the hearing.
   Mrs. Pagan, 35, who appeared distraught, did not speak at
Wednesday's hearing. She told the judge under oath Tuesday before
her arrest that she did not know where her husband and son had gone.
   David Pagan, 36, took his son, Darian, from the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Hospital sometime Sunday, police said.
   Darian was hospitalized Friday under an order from Deutsch that
was requested by the city's Child Welfare Administration because
hospital officials said the boy was not getting the treatment he
needed.
   Family members have said that Darian had been complaining of
pain and that the father wanted to take the boy to Disney World in
Florida.
   Police said they received information that Pagan may have taken
Darian to a cancer-treatment center in Arlington, Texas.
   Mrs. Pagan's lawyer, Steven Mandel, called Deutsch's detention
order improper and said he would appeal it Thursday.
   Mandel charged that the judge was using Mrs. Pagan as
``leverage'' to pressure the father to come forward.
   The lawyer insisted that Mrs. Pagan was telling the truth when
she said she didn't know where her husband and son had gone. He
said the husband had called a family member once since disappearing
said only that he and Darian were safe.
   Mandel said that when hospital officials went to the city
agency, doctors said Darian was in ``imminent danger'' if he did
not receive a radical form of radiation and chemotherapy.
   The parents, who live in Brooklyn, were upset because no such
treatment was administered between Friday, when the boy was
admitted, and Sunday, when he was taken from the hospital, Mandel
said.
   He said the child had received much medical care and treatment
for leukemia since he was diagnosed at age 2.

   She was the only one of the four of us who had the time and the
inclination to look into the investment opportunities that our
investment corporation was created to explore.
   George Mallick, my partner, was too busy looking into his own
interests. He had business interests of his own.
   Marlene Mallick was raising family.
   I was busy being a member of Congress, and majority leader. I
didn't have any time to spend on it.
   Betty alone among all of us had the time and the opportunity,
and the experience and the desire to give effort and energy to
exploring and promoting investment opportunities.
   She did indeed perform work, and it paid off for the little
corporation.
   She did it well; she studied and followed the stock market on
regional stocks _ buying and selling.
   Some of them (stocks) I had brought into the corporation that I
had owned personally, my personal estate.
   She advised as to when was a good time to sell, when was a good
time to buy and the corporation made some money on those regional
stocks _ not a lot of money by some people's standards. But we made
some money.
   Betty paid for her salary several times over.
   She maintained very frequent contract with a drilling company
that was drilling a series of gas wels, exploratory gas wells, in
West Texas in which each of the four partners had an interest,
having all borrowed money from the corporation in order to do that.
   She visited the site of drilling and maintained contact with the
company for us in that instance.
   She went to New York and studied the gem stone business and the
corporation made an investment in gem stones, made some money on
that.
   She looked into the possibility of the corporation, Mallightco,
building apartment complexes for young people, but concluded that
the interest rates were unfavorable.
   Betty spent a considerable amount of time studying the wine
culture industry, which was then just getting started in Texas.
   She made an economic study that concluded that it was too
speculative for a little corporation of our type.
   She looked into other prospective investments such as a small
limited partnership in the movie, ``Annie,'' and a prospective
venture in sulphur extraction but advised against both of those
investments.
   And it's lucky for us she did because people who invested in
them lost money.

   I want to include for printing in the record affidavits from
several business people who know from their personal experience and
attest to the work that Betty did in this regard.
   And it will appear in the record at this point _ an affidavit by
Pamela L. Smith, one by Kay F. Snyder, one by John Freeman, one by
Louis A. Farris Jr. and one by J.B. Williams _ all attesting to
their personal knowledge of these things that Betty did in working
for the corporation for $18,000 a year.
   The outside counsel employed by the committee has suggested that
Mrs. Wright's employment somehow amounted to a gift. I don't know
why, but he assumed that the services she rendered could not have
been worth $18,000 a year. How he concludes that she didn't perform
duties is to me a mystery.
   On page 20 of the statement of alleged violations I find a very
strange suggestion based on a statement that quote, there was no
evidence either supporting or establishing that the money paid to
Mrs. Wright was in return for identifiable services or work
products.
   Frankly I don't know exactly what Mr. Phelan means by ``work
products.''
   Does he want so many pages of canceled shorthand notes? So many
pages of typed manuscript? She wasn't a carpenter. Is a woman's
mental study and her time and her advice not to be counted as a
work product?
   How the committee could conclude that there was no evidence that
Betty performed duties is very puzzling to me. They don't offer any
evidence that she did not.
   When I was before the committee that wasn't one of the things
that was being considered. They didn't ask me to go into any
elaborate detail as I have just done, telling the things that she
did. They assumed, assumed that there was no evidence.
   Ah, but there was evidence! The two people of whom questions
were asked aside from myself, Mr. Mallick himself and Pamela Smith,
both testified that she did work.
   Mr. Phelan's report says that they couldn't identify but maybe
12 days in the whole four-year period in which she worked.

   Well, that's an inaccurate representation of what they said.
   Pamela Smith both in this affidavit and in her testimony before
the committee clearly said she saw Betty there from five to seven
days every month, and on weekends. And she spoke of her knowledge
of her doing work in Washington and New York and elsewhere. So
there's evidence.
   Well, does one conclude that my wife's services to that little
corporation were worth less than $18,000 a year?
   For most of her adult life Mrs. Wright has been a business
person, been an officer in a large hotel, an officer in a
successful real estate and construction firm, a professional staff
person on a congressional committee.
   She was making more than $18,000 when she worked at the
congressional committee.
   And here's the irony. The supreme irony.
   In 1976, when I was elected majority leader, Betty voluntarily
left her job as a professional staff person on the committee so as
to avoid any criticism of this institution or of her husband on the
ground that we were both on the public payroll.
   How many colleagues in the House and the Senate do you know
whose wives are on the public payroll doing good work?
   And yet Betty didn't want to be the cause for even unfounded
criticism.
   She was legally entitled to continue, she having occupied that
job before our marriage. But she chose to leave and save the
institution and her husband from unwarranted criticism.
   That's the kind of person she is.
   Now it just seems to me there isn't any justification at all for
anybody's even raising questions about whether she earned her
$18,000 a year.
   Should a member of Congress have to prove that his wife earned
that much money? Bear in mind, this money was not paid by Mr.
Mallick. The money was paid by the corporation of which Betty and I
were half-owners. (Inaudible).
   In addition to her salary as a gift, outside counsel contends in
summing up $145,000 (inaudible) that Betty had the use of a company
car. That is true, she did. For the first three years, it was used
largely by Mr. and Mrs. Mallick.
   It wasn't Mr. Mallick's car. It was the company car. The company
bought and paid for it. We owned half of it. The next four years
Betty had most of the use of it.
   Now I've done what I can to resolve any doubt.
   I want to do the right thing, the honorable thing.
   I bought and paid for that car out of my personal funds.
   The trustee of my bank trust, at my instruction, paid the
corporation full book value for the car on the day Betty first
started driving it on company business, through the whole time she
had it in her possession, plus interest.
   The interest amounted to about $9,000.
   What more can I do. Does that make it right?

<HEAD>NBC Scores Another Top 10 Sweep</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC has become so dominant in prime time, it's
mostly busy these days breaking its own records in increasingly
rapid fashion.
   Last week, NBC had the top 10 shows in the A.C. Nielsen Co.
ratings, landing both parts of the critically acclaimed two-part
movie ``I Know My First Name is Steven'' in the top two spots.
   The last time a network swept the top 10 was three weeks ago,
when NBC had the top 11 shows.
   This time, CBS broke into the list at 11th with its Sunday
movie, ``Kojak: The Price of Justice.''
   NBC won the week, a record 49th in a row, with a 14.1 rating to
CBS' 10.1 and ABC's 9.1.
   ``I Know My First Name Is Steven,'' the fact-based story of
teen-ager who returned to his family after seven years in the
captivity of the pedophile who kidnapped him, had a two-part
average rating of 24.5 and a 39 share and was the highest-rated
multi-part movie of the 1988-89 season, second only to CBS'
four-part ``Lonesome Dove.''
   The rest of the top 10 were ``Cheers,'' ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A
Different World,'' ``Golden Girls,'' ``Dear John,'' ``Empty Nest,''
``Hunter'' and ``L.A. Law.''
   The NBC movie and ``60 Minutes'' were the only non-repeat
programs among the top 20 last week.
   The ``CBS Evening News'' led the news ratings, when student
protests in China continued to be the big story. CBS had an average
rating of 9.2 and a 21 share, ``ABC World News Tonight'' had an 8.8
and 19 share, and ``NBC Nightly News'' had an 8.4 and 19.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 households with television. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The lowest-rated shows of the week were: ``Mission Impossible,''
``Family Ties Special,'' ``West 57th,'' ``Paradise,'' ``North &amp;
South, Book Two, Part Three,'' ``Earth Star Voyager, Part One,''
``Family Ties,'' ``Incredible Sunday,'' ``Lots of Luck _ Magical
World of Disney'' and ``Beyond the Cold War: Risk and Opportunity.''

<HEAD>WASHN: it right?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Now concerning the apartment, Betty and I have been more than
anxious to do what's right and honorable about that.
   We didn't think there was anything wrong with paying a per diem
rate.
   The apartment was not held out for rent to anybody else.
   It wasn't owned for rental purposes.
   Mallick found he didn't want anybody else in the apartment.
   They owned about five apartments in this apartment unit complex
area and held them out for their employees and their family.
   There wouldn't have been anybody in the apartment paying any
amount of money at all if they hadn't permitted us, when we were in
town and Betty was doing company business, to occupy the apartment.
   We paid on a daily basis for our use of that apartment.
   Meanwhile, in an effort to resolve any doubt, last year I told
Mr. Mallick that I didn't like the situation being criticized.
   He said, well, Ralph Lotkin, the committee counsel, said that it
was all right. It was in the paper. Printed in the paper four years
ago, the Fort Worth newspaper. A statement quoting the chief
counsel of the committee on standards, Mr. Lotkin, saying he didn't
see anything improper with it. I relied on that.
   Nevertheless, last year I said to George Mallick, I said, I want
to buy the apartment, George, I'll pay you for it. I did. I paid
the amount suggested and appraised by two real estate persons in
Fort Worth, $58,000. Now if anybody thinks that's too low a price
I'll sell it to you today for $58,000.
   Well, I just wanted to clear the air and remove doubts and say
if we've made a mistake we've done what we can to set things right.
I don't think we've violated any rules. I think you're entitled to
know that. My respect for you leads me to want to tell you that.
   The second alleged violation continues on the assumption that
Betty's employment and these little benefits that she had were
gifts. And then it further assumes that George Mallick, our friend
and business partner, had a direct interest in influencing
legislation, which would make it illegal for us to accept gifts
from him.
   Now how do they arrive at that suggestion? I've known this man
for more than 25 years. He's been my friend, good, decent,
hardworking man of Lebanese extraction. His father had a wholesale
grocery store there. His grandfather came with a wagon and a cart
to Georgia. He's been successful, moderately so.
   Never once in all the years that I've known this man has he ever
asked me to vote for or against any piece of legislation. Not once.
   That's not the basis of our friendship. That's not the way our
relationship. (Inaudible).
   You have friends like that.
   They never ask for anything.
   All they want is to be friends.
   Not one time has he ever asked me to intercede with any
administrative agency of government on behalf of him or of any
institution in which he has an interest. Not once. Not once.
   So how do they say that he had a direct interest in influencing
legislation?

<HEAD>WASHN: influencing legislation?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   On page 58 of the committee report, it is suggested that simply
because he was in the real estate business, that he had some oil
and gas investments, the committee might infer, that's the word,
the committee might infer that he could be deemed a person with an
interest of a direct nature in legislation.
   The committee suggests he might have an interest in the tax
code. Well, who doesn't? Every taxpayer's got an interest in the
tax code. Everybody who ever expects to receive Social Security has
an interest in the Social Security code. All people have an
interest of some kind in the results of legislation, don't they?
   That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about whether
or not they have a direct interest in trying to influence the
course of legislation.
   Now, where would you go to find out what that means, if somebody
wanted to associate with you in some way and be in business with
you some way back home in a perfectly legal way, whether he had an
interest in legislation or not?
   Whom would you consult if you were in doubt about it? I wasn't
in doubt. But suppose you were?
   Wouldn't you think you'd consult the publications of the
committee, consult the people who wrote the rules?
   Well, the people who wrote the rules don't think George Mallick
had an interest in the legislation.
   David Obey was the chairman of the committee that drafted those
rules. He asserts clearly, unequivocally, emphatically,
unabiguously, both in an affidavit that he wrote and the report he
wrote for the Washington Post that doesn't fit George Mallick's
case.
   He doesn't have an interest in legislation as defined under the
rules, the rules that David and his committee wrote. Harold Sawyer,
former Republican member from Michigan, who served on that
committee with David Obey, says the same thing.
   I have here an affadavit from Mr. Sawyer in which he states
exactly that same conclusion.
   And there's an affidavit of Donald F. Terry, who was currently _
is employed now by the Committee on Small Business, but was a staff
member on the Commission on Administrative Review which was charged
in 1976 with the responsibility of drafting new rules of official
conduct for the House. Most of what he refers to has to do with the
question of book royalties. I shall come to that next.
   But in these matters, these three people who had a great deal to
do with writing the rules say that's not what they intended when
they wrote the rules. I offer these for printing in the record.
   Where else might you turn if you were in doubt?
   Might you not possibly go to the committee itself to see what
advisory opinions it has given?
   Here is the publication that the committee sends to all of us to
tell us what is and is not legal.
   Each year we receive this as instructions for filling out our
financial disclosure statement.
   Appendix E is an advisory opinion, No. 10, which defines who has
a direct interest in legislation under the law.
   It says that if the member does not believe that the donor of
the gift has a distinct or special interest in the congressional
legislative process which sets him clearly apart from general
public, then the member should feel free to accept such gifts.
   That's the official advice from the committee _ given to every
member.
   Then it defines in summary who has an interest in legislation as
prohibitedunder the rule.
   Four classes, that's all: registered lobbyists, George Mallick's
not a registered lobbyist; somebody that employes a registered
lobbyist, George Mallick never did that; somebody who directs or
operates a political action committee, George Mallick has never
done that; or finally any other individual which the member knows,
not should know or ought to suspect or ought to infer, but which
the member knows has a distinct and special interest in influencing
or affecting the legislative process.
   Not just somebody who's got an interest financially in the
outcome of legislation, not at all!
   Somebody that you know who has a direct or special interest in
influencing the outcome of the legislative process. (Inaudible.)
   That was just simply not the case.
   So he had no direct interest in the legislation, of any type
that anybody could define.

   Now we have motions before the committee to set that aside, set
aside that presumption of a man's having direct interest in
legislation if they haven't got a reason to believe he has.
   The only they have suggested is that in 1986 his son borrowed
money from a savings and loan to build a little shopping center of
his own _ wholly apart and foreign to any investments Betty and I
had, nothing to do with it at all; his son.
   And that in 1987 the lending institution had to foreclose.
   Yeah, but the period when Betty was employed, presumably as a
gift, was 1981 to 1984.
   He couldn't have known in '81 and '84 that his son was going to
borrow money in '86 and the thing go bad in '87 and the economic
decline make it impossible to pay off his note on time; he couldn't
have known that.
   And anyway, would you stretch the thing to the point of saying
that just anybody who has a member of his family that owes money to
a bank or a savings and loan is forbidden?
   Of course you wouldn't. That'd cover more than half the citizens
of the country.
   The people who wrote the rules don't believe that he's covered.
   The people who've been interpreting the rules don't believe he's
covered. And so I think under all reasonable circumstances, that
motion ought to be agreed to, it ought to be agreed to, if rules
mean anything, if we're not just going to turn the whole thing on
its head and change rules by whim every time we turn around.
   Now the only other basic question, it's just one that remains,
in the statement of alleged violations, concerns the sale of a
book, a little book now you'll recall ``Reflections of a Public
Man'' which I wrote and which was sold sometimes in bulk quantities.
   People who took it and gave it away to other people _ students,
newspapers, public officials and members of their organizations.
   And I wanted them to.
   I wanted to get the widest possible distribution of the book.
   A book that you write kinda part of you. You think of it a child
almost. It's probably not great literature, but I like it.
   Marty Tolchin of The New York Times; John Silber, president of
Boston University; Jim Lehrer of MacNeil-Lehrer Report, and Dr.
Tucker, chancellor of TCU, all said nice things about it and I
appreciate that.

   Now, the contention of the committee as I understand it is that
this book project to publish that book on which I got $3.25 for
every book that sold was a kind of a sham and a subterfuge itself
and an overall scheme for me to exceed and violate the outside
earnings limitation of a member of Congress.
   I mean, do you think I'd do something like that?
   Perhaps the book _ $3.25 is what I got out of it, and I didn't
get any advance. The purpose of the book was to publish something
at a small cost and get wide distribution.
   If monetary gain had been my primary interest, don't you think I
would have gone to one of the big Madison Avenue publications, the
houses there that give you a big advance?
   I know people who received advances before a single book sells
from those big companies, twice and three times as much as I got in
the total sales of all those books.
   If it had been a scheme to get around outside earning limits,
that's what I might have done.
   I hear that a woman author of a book called ``Mayflower Madam''
got $750,000 in advance royalties. I don't know that to be true.
   A former speaker, Mr. O'Neill, is said to have received a
million dollars for his excellent and readable book in advance
before any of them were sold.
   I have read that a woman named Kitty Kelly has received as much
as $2 million in advance royalties for a book she's written on
Nancy Reagan, which as I understand it is not even an authorized
biography.
   Well, so much for that.
   It is true I think that people on my staff were eager to sell
these books. They knew I wanted them sold.
   I've got to accept some responsibility for that if it was wrong,
but the rule doesn't say it was wrong.
   It couldn't have been an overall scheme to avoid outside earning
limits because the rules are clear.
   They're not equivocal.
   The rules expressly exempt royalty income.
   And that, too, is attested to by David Obey. It's attested to by
Donald Terry, who gives the rationale and the expression.
   There wasn't any exception.
   Book royalties were exempted.
   Now maybe they shouldn't have been.
   Now maybe somebody got the impression that buying a book was the
price of getting me to make a speech.
   I never intended that impression. I never suggested that.
   I hope that friends of mine did not.
   Of all the books that were sold, the outside counsel suggests
that seven cases involve instances where individuals associated
with organizations to which I made speeches bought multiple copies
of the books and distributed them among members of the organization
or others.
   Now I have not been permitted to see the copy of their
testimony, so I don't know exactly what they said.
   I've asked people on my staff, did you tell these folks that
they had to buy these books or I wouldn't make a speech?
   They said no, they didn't.
   The total amount as I figure from all of those sales that are
involved is about $7,700, what I received.
   And I'd do whatever was necessary, whatever was right.
   If those people were under the impression that I wasn't going to
make a speech to them unless they bought a bunch of books, if they
wanted their money, I'd give them that money, I don't want the
money.
   That's not important.
   What's important is a person's honor and his intergrity.
   During that three-year period when the counsel says there are
seven instances where I made speeches to groups and they bought
copies of these books, seven groups, seven instances, I made at
least 700 speeches, for which I didn't get any honorarium.
   Didn't offer to sell anybody a book.
   Nobody had the chance to buy a book.
   Do you suppose if there had been an overall scheme there
wouldn't have been a wider kind of an experience than that?
   I don't know.
   I'm just saying to you that I didn't intend to try to violate
the outside earning limitations and I don't believe legally that I
did.
   Some of the rest of you make a lot of speeches.
   How many speeches do you suppose you make that you don't get
anything for?
   Most of us do. Well, what can I do?
   One other thing about the books that I suppose needs elaboration.
   It involves the allegation in the statement of alleged
violations that a man named S. Gene Payte, a reputable businessman
in Fort Worth, paid for more books that he got from the publisher,
that they didn't deliver enough books to him.
   Now that's what was said in the report of the outside counsel.
   S. Gene Payte, upon reading that report, issued an affadavit
that is not ambiguous at all.
   Here's what Mr. Payte says.
   I'll read in part this affidavit and put the whole thing in the
record.
   He says: ``I have read the report of special outside counsel
Richard J. Phelan on the preliminary inquiry conducted pursuant to
the committee's June 9 resolution as it relates to my testimony. I
also have reviewed the transcript of my deposition testimony. The
report, and also the conclusions reached by the special counsel,
ignored much of the most pertinent testimony in the transcript,
takes certain statements out of context, distorts clear statements
of fact and in general fails fairly and accurately to summarize the
matters as to which I testified.

<TEXT>
   For years, Solidarity advocated boycotting
elections because the outcome was controlled by the ruling
Communists.
   Now, with Poles about to choose the first freely elected
legislative chamber in the East bloc, the newly reinstated free
trade union movement must teach its supporters how to vote.
   That is not a simple matter.
   Voters on Sunday will receive from four to seven ballots and
must cross out the names of the dozens of candidates they do not
want.
   The ballots, moreover, will not identify the affiliation of the
candidates.
   ``Learn, remember and note down the names of the Solidarity
candidates'' instructs one of the leaflets Solidarity is
distributing to make sure voters cast valid ballots.
   The complicated procedure is a major hurdle facing Solidarity as
it mobilizes for the first elections since 1947 to allow candidates
not backed by the Communist Party.
   The Solidarity-led opposition believes it will be able to
safeguard the honest conduct of the election as its people will
comprise about a third of the members of the commissions running
the elections.
   At stake are all 100 seats in the resurrected Senate and the 460
seats in the existing Sejm, or parliament. Independent candidates
may only run for 161 seats in the Sejm.
   ``It is the first election of this kind, and I personally assume
that there will be a considerable number of invalid votes,'' said
Miroslaw Sierawski, a district election official for the Democratic
Party, part of the ruling Communist alliance.
   The communist coalition is giving its own voting lessons,
although they are less critical because it is guaranteed 65 percent
of the seats in the more powerful Sejm.
   Solidarity, however, has launched a massive information campaign
to provide the names of its candidates and instructions on voting
techniques. It also plans to have information tables outside as
many polling places as possible.
   On television, Solidarity turned the lesson over to a popular
commedian who was shown packing several pairs of glasses lest his
poor eyesight result in a miscast vote.
   Solidarity activists have aroused government anger for
suggesting in some publications that one way to ensure valid votes
for Solidarity candidates is to cross out all other names.
   ``Only the opposition, that's no proposition,'' goes a
government slogan.
   The targets of a cross-out campaign would include 35 key
candidates of the Communist coalition who are running uncontested
for the Sejm but must receive at least 50 percent of the vote in
order to be elected.
   The key candidates include high government party officials such
as Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and Interior Minister
Czeslaw Kiszczak.
   Kiszczak led the government delegation in the talks with the
opposition that produced the historic accord restoring Solidarity
after a seven-year ban and outlining the terms under which the
opposition is taking part in elections.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has told supporters to evaluate
party candidates individually.

   ``But the conclusion reached by the special counsel that, quote,
I quote from the outside counsel report, `Wright violated rule
so-and-so, clause four, was based on category of assertion that
quote Gene Payte did not receive the books.''
   The special counsel asserts, Payte testified, and I am quoting,
that he only received between 300 and 500 copies of the book, for
$6,000, and makes the flat statement, quote, Gene Payte did not
receive the books, citing as authority Payte's transcript.
   Now here is what Payte says: On the contrary, I did not so
testify. I stated not once, but three times that I believe that
1,000 books were delivered to me. Transcript 27, 40, 41.
   The special counsel ignores this testimony.
   Instead, he cites transcripts 77. And that citation does not
support the special counsel's assertion. Transcript 77 shows that
Congressman Myers, not I, made the comment, ``I believe you said
you received three to 500 books?'' I did not confirm that
recollection, my reply being, ``I would like to have all the books.
In fact, I never so testified.''
   So this is a copy of that affidavit which I should like to
submit for the record, together with a copy of a letter that was
sent by the committee to Mr. Payte after he issued this affidavit,
telling him he ought not to comment.
   What do you think of that?
   A private citizen, a reputable citizen of my community,
misquoted in a document published at public expense, sent widely to
newspapers throughout the country, widely cited as authority,
uncritically, assumed to be accurate.
   The citizen being misquoted, issues an affidavit to straighten
it out and so not be misquoted in the public record.
   And then he is warned by the committee that he may be held in
violation and contempt of Congress if he doesn't shut up.
   First Amendment rights supersede any rules of any committee.
   And any citizen of the United States ought to have the right to
have his own testimony correctly characterized, and not be
threatened, silenced, by a House committee.
   Any House committee owes to a citizen of the United States that
right, that privilege.
   Well, those are basically the matters that pend before the
committee in our motion to dismiss.
   Those motions could clear the air.
   Rules are important, just like the constancy of what a law means
is important to a citizen.
   If they can resolve these particular legal issues, as to what
constitutes direct interest in legislation, and whether or not book
royalities are exempt as the rules say they are.
   I think it is important for the motions to be ruled upon, and I
earnestly hope that the committee will look at it from that
standpoint, and grant our motions.
   Members are entitled to know what the rules mean, and if they
still mean what they meant when they were written and promulgated.
   Now, maybe the rules need to be changed.
   If so, let's change them in the legal, orderly way, let's vote
on them. Let's vote to change them.
   Maybe the whole process needs some change and clarification.
   You know, we may want to consider, the House may want to
consider establishing a House counsel to whom members can look for
official advice and then rely on that advice.
   The rules of the committee itself might need some
reconsideration.
   Having gone through this agonizing experience for about a year
now, I mean almost every day there is a new story in the newspaper,
leaked, without any chance of me to know what is coming next and no
chance of me to go to the committee and answer it and say, ``Hey,
wait a minute, that is not correct, that is not right.''
   Maybe the committee that is currently required to sit as a kind
of grand jury and petit jury both, ought to have a different
composition.
   Rather than those who issue the statement of alleged violation
being the same people who have to judge them, I think it clearly is
difficult to expect members who have publicly announced reason to
believe there is a violation to reverse their position at a hearing
stage and dismiss charges against a member.
   Maybe once a report of alleged violations is issued, the
committee rules ought to allow the member to respond expeditiously.
   You know, to deny a member the opportunity to reply quickly can
cause serious political injury.
   It is unfair.
   Once alleged violations are announced, the committee ought to
just immediately release to the member all the evidence that it
could have to indicate that that's happened.
   In my case, for example, the committee has yet to release any
witness testimony or documents that it obtained during the
investigation.
   Why hide the evidence? What is there to hide?
   This ought not to be the kind of proceedings in which strategic
maneuvering be allowed to override fundamental relations of fair
play.
   I urge the abolition of the gag order, too, which the committee
said it forbids any witness who comes and makes a deposition from
discussing publicly or telling his side of the thing.
   And, I just suppose the charges which the committee concludes
are unfounded should not be published and widely disseminated as
though were true and bore the imprimatur of the committee's
approval.
   There are other things you want to consider.
   I am not trying to give you an exhaustive list of what might
happen.
   I know there are others who have views that are equally relevant.
   Perhaps we want to consider outright abolition of all honoraria,
speaking fees, altogether.
   Maybe we want to do that.
   I don't know.
   It's up to the House.
   In exchange for a straightforward, honest increase in the salary
for members of all three branches of the government.
   It is intolerably hurtful to our government that qualified
members of the executive and legislative branches are resigning
because of ambiguities and confusion surrounding the ethics laws,
and because of their own consequent vulnerability to personal
attack.
   That's a shame.
   It's happening.
   And it is grievously hurtful to our society.
   When vilification becomes an accepted form of political debate,
when negative campaigning becomes a fulltime occupation, when
members of each party become self-appointed vigilantes carrying out
personal vendettas against members of the other party, in God's
name that is not what this institution is supposed to be all about.
   When vengeance becomes more desirable than vindication, harsh
personal attacks upon one another's motives and one another's
character drown out the quiet logic of serious debate on important
issues, things that we ought to be involved ourselves in, surely
that is unworthy of our institution, unworthy of our American
political process.
   All of us, in both political parties, must resolve to bring this
period of mindless cannibalism to an end.
   There has been enough of it.
   I pray to God that we will do that and restore the spirit that
always existed in this House.

<HEAD>WASHN: this House.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   When I first came here all those years ago in 1955 this was a
place where a man's word was his bond and his honor and truth of
what he said to you were assumed. You didn't have to prove it.
   I remember one time Cleve Bailey, West Virginia, in a moment of
impassioned concern over a tariff bill, jumped up and made an
objection to the fact that Chet Hollifield had voted _ in those
days we shouted our answers to the votes, and Hollifield was back
there in the back.
   And Bailey said, ``I object to the gentlemen's from California
vote being counted. He came down and voted late.'' He said, ``He
was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore he's
not entitled to vote.''
   It was a close vote.
   Speaker Rayburn grew red as a tomato and I thought he was going
to break the gavel when he hammered.
   He said, ``The chair always takes the word of a member.''
   And then because I was sitting over here behind Cleve Bailey, I
heard other members come and say, ``Cleve, you're wrong. Chet was
back there behind the rail and I was standing by him when he
answered. His answer just wasn't heard.''
   Others said, ``You shouldn't have said that.''
   And Cleve Bailey, crusty old West Virginian, came down here and
abjectly, literally with tears in his eyes, apologized for having
questioned the word of a member.
   Now, we need that.
   Have I made mistakes?
   Oh, boy, how many!
   I made a lot of mistakes.
   Mistakes in judgment, oh, yeah.
   A lot of them.
   I'll make some more.
   Recently, let me just comment on this briefly because it's such
a sensational thing, and the injury's been done to me in this
particular moment because of it.
   John Mack.
   Many of you remember him, know him.
   I think a lot of you like him and respect him.
   I helped John one time in his life when he was about 19 years
old, 20.
   I didn't know him, never had met him.
   I didn't know the nature of a crime that he had been convicted
of.
   I knew only that John Mack was a young man whom my daughter had
known in high school.
   My daughter was married to his brother, incidentally.
   That's how she knew about John.
   And she mentioned it to me.
   All I knew was that he'd been convicted of assault and that he'd
served 27 months in a Fairfax County jail.
   Contrary to what's been published, I did not interfere with the
court.
   I didn't suggest anything to the court.
   I didn't have anything to do with his sentencing.
   I really didn't know and didn't inquire _ maybe that's bad
judgment _ I didn't inquire as to the exact nature of the crime.
   The sheriff's office in Fairfax County called and asked me if I
would know of any job that I could help this young man get.
   They wanted to parole him.
   They said he'd been a model rehabilitated prisoner.
   And I gave him a job as a file clerk, you know, $9,000 a year.
   After that he really blossomed and grew and developed and those
of you who know him can't conceive as I never could conceive when
finally just two years ago I read in the newspaper the precise
nature of that crime.
   It just didn't fit his character.
   He married, had two beautiful children.
   Wonderfully responsible, and I think had become a very fine
person.
   Now, was that bad judgment?
   You know, maybe so.
   It doesn't have anything to do with the rules, but it's got all
mixed up with it and I don't think ... it's bad judgment to try to
give a young man a second chance.
   Maybe I should have known more about it.
   But in this case I think he has turned out well.
   And I don't believe that America really stands for the idea that
a person should forever be condemned, but I think maybe ought to
have a second chance.
   And that's what I thought in the case of John Mack.
   Good judgment or bad, I mean that's it.
   I believe in giving somebody a second chance.

   Have I contributed unwittingly to this manic idea of a frenzy of
feeding on other people's reputations?
   Have I at all caused a lot of this?
   So maybe I have. God, I hope I haven't, but maybe I have.
   Have I been too partisan?
   Too insistent?
   Too abrasive?
   Too determined to have my way?
   Perhaps.
   Maybe so.
   If I have offended anybody in the other party, I'm sorry.
   I never meant to, would not have done so intentionally.
   I always tried to treat all of our colleagues, Democrats and
Republicans, with respect.
   Are there things I would do differently if I had them to do over
again?
   Oh, boy, how many may I name for you?
   Well, I tell you what: I'm going to make you a proposition.
   Let me give you back this job you gave to me as a propitiation
for all of this season of bad will that has grown up among us; give
it back to you.
   I will resign as speaker of the House effective upon the
election of my successor and I'll ask that we call a caucus on the
Democratic side for next Tuesday to choose a successor.
   I don't want to be a party to tearing up the institution.
   I love it.
   To tell you the truth, this year, it has been very difficult for
me to offer the kind of moral leadership that the organization
needs because every time I have tried to talk about the needs of
the country, about the needs for affordable homes, Jack Kemp's idea
or an idea that we are developing here, everytime I have tried to
talk about the need for minimum wage, tried to talk about the need
for day care centers, embracing ideas on both sides of the aisle,
the media have not been interested in that.
   They wanted to ask me about petty personal finances.
   You need somebody else.
   So I want to give you that back.
   We'll have a caucus on Tuesday.
   And then, I will offer to resign from the House sometime before
the end of June.
   Let that be a total payment for the anger and hostility that we
feel for each other.
   Let's not try to get even with each other.
   Republicans, please don't get in your heads you need to get
somebody else because of John Tower.
   Democrats, please don't feel you need to get somebody on the
other side because of me.
   We ought to be more mature than that.
   Let's restore to this institution the rightful priorities of
what is good for this country.
   Let's all work together to try to achieve them.
   The nation has important business and it can't afford these
distractions, and that is why I offer to resign.
   I have enjoyed these years in Congress.
   I am grateful to all of you who have taught me things and been
patient with me.
   Horace Greeley had a quote that Harry Truman used to like.
``Fame is a vapor. Popularity an accident. Riches take wings. Those
who cheer today may curse tomorrow. Only one thing endures.
Character.''
   I am not a bitter man.
   I am not going to be.
   I am a lucky man.
   God has given me the privilege of serving in this, the greatest
institution on Earth, for a great many years, and I am grateful to
the people of my district in Texas, I am grateful to my colleagues,
all of you.
   God bless this institution.
   God bless the United States.

   A federal grand jury will soon start hearing
testimony about the office hiring practices of Walter Fauntroy, the
District of Columbia's non-voting delegate to Congress, The
Associated Press has learned.
   As part of the ongoing Justice Department inquiry, current and
former employees of Fauntroy, a Democrat, and Rep. Gus Savage,
D-Ill., will be asked to testify on Fauntroy's hiring of Savage's
son, according to sources familiar with the investigation.
   Thomas John Savage, the son of Rep. Savage, was paid $21,398
while on Fauntroy's payroll between September 1987 and June 1988,
but swore on Illinois election documents that he was living in
Chicago during that time. Those records were filed as part of his
unsuccessful bid to win an Illinois House seat.
   Employees from the Fauntroy and Savage offices will be
subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury within the next month, and
investigators have already subpoenaed payroll documents and office
personnel data from the two congressmen, said sources, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
   Those records have been requested to determine whether the
younger Savage, his father or Fauntroy falsified payroll documents
or offered false statements to investigators.
   Fauntroy and Rep. Savage refused to comment when asked whether
documents from his office had been requested by federal authorities.
   When contacted by telephone in Chicago, Thomas John Savage
declined to comment Wednesday.
   In addition, investigators are examining all of Fauntroy's
congressional staff and committee hirings for the past five years,
the sources said.
   Investigators are also examining the personal banking records of
Thomas Savage to learn whether he returned any money to his father
or Fauntroy, the sources familiar with the investigation said.
   Investigators also are closely examining accounts of the younger
Savage's job duties submitted voluntarily to federal officials by
Johnny Barnes, Fauntroy's chief aide, and several other Fauntroy
staffers, sources said.
   Barnes refused Wednesday to comment on the documents.
   The FBI opened the case with a 90-day preliminary investigation
in December, shortly after the AP reported on Fauntroy's hiring of
the younger Savage.
   Officials at the Justice Department's Criminal Division then
recommended that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh appoint a special
prosecutor to look into the case under the terms an order by his
predecessor, Edwin Meese III. That rule, instituted by Meese just
days before he left office last August, required an independent
prosecutor to examine cases of alleged wrongdoing by members of
Congress.
   However, Thornburgh scuttled the Meese order and turned the
investigation back to the Justice Department's criminal division,
which traditionally handles such cases.

<HEAD>Brady Plan Attacked as Inadequate to Cut Third World Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading economic expert today attacked
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's plan for reducing Third World
debt, saying the proposal will not effectively reduce the billions
paid out every year in interest.
   The debt of the developing nations is estimated at $1.2
trillion, about half of it owed to commercial banks.
   John Williamson, senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics, points to an outflow of $37.3 billion from
debtor to creditor countries last year.
   ``It still looks as though it will be difficult to achieve
debt-service reduction of $7 billion a year with a pool of $25
billion or less,'' Williamson wrote in a revised edition of his
study ``Voluntary Approaches to Debt Relief,'' published today.
   Debt service usually includes payments on both principal and
interest. Few of the troubled debtor countries have paid any
principal since 1982. Some, such as Argentina, are far behind on
their interest payments.
   Williamson suggested that a pool of $40 billion to $50 billion
is needed. Some of the new borrowing might be used by the debtors
to pay off old debt at a discount. He would like see some old debt
swapped for new debt, with interest assured to the banks at a lower
rate.
   Brady's proposal, unveiled March 10, encourages banks to forgive
a substantial portion of their loans to heavily indebted countries
in return for guarantees that the rest will be paid. The guarantees
are to be furnished by the International Monetary Fund and its
sister agency, the World Bank.
   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said Wednesday the
commercial banks must do more to help Third World countries reduce
their debts.
   Treasury spokesmen refuse to estimate officially how much may be
available for debt relief. They say that will depend on how many
countries ask for it, and how many promise to meet the conditions.
The bank and fund require some austerity policies from the
borrowing countries in return for help.
   Williamson says he finds disappointing Brady's call for new
policies by all debtors to qualify for support. The economist
suggests that countries which already have taken austerity measures
should be rewarded with arrangements to provide a definitive
solution to their crises. He names Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Mexico and Uruguay.
   Williamson sees a failure by Brady to offer a solution to the
problem of ``free riders'' _ creditor banks that refuse to make any
reduction in the amount of debt or interest owed them.
   Williamson proposes that banks which will not provide any other
debt relief should accept a limit on debtors' payments to them, the
limit to be set by the amount the debtor country earns from its
exports. The rest of the money owed to the banks would be added to
the total debt.
   Williamson is a former adviser to the British Treasury and the
International Monetary Fund. The Institute for International
Economics was created by the (West) German Marshall Fund and gets
support from it and from other governments and foundations.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Edged Up Last Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overall prices on farm products edged upward
last month, with record demand for broilers, potatoes and tomatoes,
according to the Department of Agriculture.
   Prices on raw products rose 2.7 percent from April to May and
averaged 13 percent more than a year ago, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   Increases in the prices of hogs, oranges, potatoes, broilers and
tomatoes were partially offset by lower prices for sweet corn,
eggs, lettuce and soybeans, said the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board in a preliminary report.
   But broiler, potato and tomato prices were at record levels.
Hogs also increased sharply from April.
   Demand for oranges was so strong that the average price went
higher than it has been since November 1987.
   Cattle prices continued close to April levels. Wheat and corn
prices were up slightly while soybeans were down from a month
earlier.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the price index for livestock
and livestock products was up 2.6 percent from April to May, and
4.6 percent above a year ago at this time.
   Compared with April, higher prices for hogs and broilers more
than offset lower prices for eggs and milk.
   Crop prices, overall, rose 3.6 percent from a month earlier and
24 percent above a year earlier.
   The overall index of prices paid to farmers in May averaged 151
percent of a 1977 base used for comparison.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $70.10 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, steady with April. The average is for all types of
cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $42.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $36.30 in
April and $46.30 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.58 a bushel, up from $2.56 in April and $1.98 in
May 1988.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $4.07 per bushel, compared with $4.03 in April and $2.97 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $6.53 per 100 pounds, down from $6.66 in April
and $7.97 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $7.15 per bushel, compared with $7.29 in April
and $6.98 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 57.7 cents per pound, compared to
59 in April and 58.3 cents a pound in May 1988.
   _Eggs were 54.3 cents per dozen, compared with 58.1 cents in
April and 33 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $12.20 per 100 pounds, compared with $12.30 in April
and $11.40 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 45.2 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
39 cents in April and 33.7 cents a year ago.

   Farmers will have to reduce the acreage they
plant in wheat next season by 5 percent, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter says.
   ``We need more wheat,'' said Kelly Shipp, in explaining why the
set-aside was not higher.
   Each year, the agriculture secretary is required to decide what,
if any, acreage should be set aside in order to keep surpluses
down. Yeutter could have asked for a greater acreage reduction or
none at all.
   In past years acreage has been reduced by as much as 25 percent
because of large surpluses.
   Currently, U.S. wheat supplies are low because of the success of
the program in the past and two years of drought.
   Yeutter said price support loans and purchase rates would be
$1.95 a bushel, a 20 percent reduction from the basic loan and
purchase rate of $2.44.
   This is the minimum allowed by law and 5 percent below the 1989
loan and purchase rate of $2.06 a bushel.
   He also set the established target price at $4 a bushel, the
statutory minimum and down about 2 percent from the 1989 target
price.
   Furthermore, he said he would not implement paid land
diversions, marketing loans or related programs. No secretary since
1985 has implemented these programs for wheat or corn, in part
because prices have been high and there has been no need for them.

   Seven days of drenching rain was good for the
dry central Plains states and western Corn Belt, but caused
flooding in the Ozarks and Ohio Valley, slowing fieldwork for the
second consecutive week, according to a report released Wednesday.
   There were fewer than two suitable work days in Indiana and Ohio
during the week ending May 28, with three or four good days in the
Delta region.
   Winter wheat prospects continue to be fair to poor with
harvesting under way in California, Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas.
   In Kansas, rain improved winter wheat condition, but the outlook
is still very poor to poor. Wheat streak mosaic and Russian wheat
aphids were problems in the panhandle of Nebraska, while hail
damaged the crop in some east-central counties of Arkansas.
   Spring wheat was mostly good to fair with planting 98 percent
complete, according to the report by the Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility.
   Corn and soybean planting, at 89 percent and 55 percent complete
respectively, are behind schedule because of the heavy rain in the
Delta and eastern Corn Belt.

   Barely an hour after Jim Wright announced he
was resigning, Majority Leader Tom Foley took to the telephone to
rally support in a bid for speaker of the House that is likely to
be uncontested.
   Foley, who remained a Wright loyalist to the end, took his usual
cautious approach in his pursuit of the speakership, telling
reporters late Wednesday he ``assumed'' he would be a candidate.
   As he did when he was elected to the No. 2 leadership post,
Foley said he intends to call all 259 of his Democratic colleagues
asking for their votes.
   ``I will call as many as I can,'' said Foley, who represents a
mostly conservative district in eastern Washington state that
stretches from the Canadian border to the Oregon line.
   Foley said he had ``scrupulously'' avoided contacting any
members prior to Wright's Wednesday announcement he was stepping
down.
   ``The difference now is that there is a vacancy,'' said Foley,
adding that even though no opponent for the speakership has
surfaced he felt it necessary to ask members for their votes.
   During his 25 years in Congress, Foley has built a reputation as
a skilled political negotiator, more interested in compromise than
confrontation. Foley is a consensus builder who is not adverse to
engaging in trench warfare with Republicans, but would prefer to
avoid it.
   ``One of the things I would like to accomplish is to help bring
a spirit of mutual respect and reconciliation back to Congress,''
said Foley.
   Foley sat calmly in the speaker's chair as Wright delivered his
resignation speech on the House floor Wednesday. Immediately after
returning to his office, Foley huddled with his top aides and
started making phone calls. Democratic members of the Washington
state House delegation came first.
   ``He told me he was absolutely running and asked for my
support,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., a close friend of Foley.
   Dicks said that Foley was putting together a ``support group''
that would be making phone calls to other members.
   ``I don't sense any need that he has to campaign, but he has to
go through the formality of asking members for their support,''
said Dicks.
   Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., said he, too, received a call from Foley
asking for his support.
   ``It's typical Tom Foley, he's not taking anything for
granted,'' said Swift.
   He said it was absolutely essential that Foley contact as many
members as he can before the Democratic caucus meets Tuesday and if
he had waited to start making those calls it might have sent the
wrong message.
   ``This is the kind of situation that if he made no move, in five
hours there would be rumors flying about Foley not being interested
in the job,'' said Swift. ``A gaping silence could be interpreted
as meaning he was having second thoughts or is taking it for
granted.
   ``Foley is too skilled a politican to let that happen. This is
not a case of any disloyalty to Wright.''

<HEAD>Study Points to Growing Energy Burden on Poor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's poor, suffering from cuts in aid
levels, are spending three times as much of their income on home
energy bills as the average U.S. household, according to a newly
released study.
   The report issued Wednesday by the National Consumer Law Center,
a non-profit organization, said many state governments have not
made up fully for recent declines in federal energy assistance to
the poor. It said some states are cutting aid levels.
   ``These factors all conspire to leave the poor mired in their
energy crisis, a crisis which is bound to continue,'' said Charles
Hill of the consumer group.
   The study said low-income households spend, on average, 11
percent of their income on home energy costs, compared with a
national average of 3.4 percent.
   Among the group's other findings:
   _In 25 states plus the District of Columbia average home energy
bills for low-income residents exceeded $1,000 last year. The
highest was $1,611, in Delaware. Costs were below $800 a year in
just three states: California, Nevada and Tennessee.
   _Average home energy costs during the winter exceeded $100 a
month for the poor last year in 43 states and the District of
Columbia.
   _In 10 of 16 states for which complete data was available on
recipients of federal low-income home energy aid, the average
household had $75 or less to spend per week on food, transportation
and other needs after paying winter heating bills.
   Alaska and Hawaii were not included in the study for technical
reasons, the group said.
   The study focused on several different categories of poor
households to compare conditions for the elderly, families of
unemployed, and households reliant on minimum wage jobs.
   For widows or widowers of Social Security recipients, average
home energy bills in one-third of the states exceeded 20 percent of
the benefits. The highest was Delaware, 27 percent; the lowest was
13 percent in Nevada and California.
   For families in which the head of the household is employed at
the minimum wage of $3.35 an hour, average energy costs were more
than 15 percent of income in 21 states plus the District of
Columbia.
   In 17 states, households in which unemployment compensation is
the basic source of income had on average $100 or less a week to
spend on non-energy items during winter months. Those in
Massachusetts were best off, with $164 a week left after paying the
heating bills; Indiana was worst off, at $75 a week.
   The study said that while federal energy aid to the poor has
been a major help since it was started in 1980, the amount of
assistance has been declining since 1985 when the average benefit
nationwide was $224. Last year's average benefit was $194, the
group said, and the figure is expected to drop again this year.
   Many states have supplemented the federal aid with money
collected from oil companies for violating 1970s price controls,
but the study said it found that these additional state funds have
not made up fully for the drop in federal aid.

<HEAD>Wright Defends Hiring of Man Convicted of Assault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright defended his decision
of 14 years ago to hire a man who had been convicted of brutally
assaulting a young woman, saying he wanted to ``give a young
gentleman a second chance.''
   Near the end of his resignation speech on Wednesday, Wright
said: ``I didn't know the nature of a crime that he had been
convicted of. I don't think ... it's bad judgment to try and give a
young gentleman a second chance.''
   Wright hired John P. Mack as a mail clerk, a $9,000-a-year job,
and Mack rose to become Wright's closest aide as executive director
of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. Mack resigned that
$86,000-a-year position position May 11 after his victim, Pamela
Small, told her story in The Washington Post.
   ``Maybe I should have known more about'' the crime, Wight said.
However, ``I don't think that America really stands for the notion
that a person should be forever condemned,'' he added.
   Mack pleaded guilty to beating and stabbing Ms. Small and
leaving her for dead in 1973 after she asked him for assistance in
a store in suburban Annandale, Va., where he worked. Mack, 19 at
the time of the crime, was sentenced to 15 years in prison but
served only 27 months in a county jail before being released.
   Wright noted that at the time he hired Mack as a clerk, Wright's
daughter was married to Mack's brother.
   ``I didn't know him,'' Wright told the House Wednesday. ``I knew
only that John Mack was a young man that my daughter had known in
high school.... All I knew was that he was convicted of
assault....''
   Mack had come under fire from several House members because,
they insisted, he had never shown contrition for his crime and had
offered no financial assistance to Ms. Small. In his resignation
statement, he apologized for ``a terrible and tragic mistake.''
   Mack added: ``To Pamela Small, and also to my family, all I can
say now is what I have said many times before and to myself every
day since this happened, and that is I am sorry. Truly sorry.''

<TEXT>
   It was on a windswept mountaintop
not far from this village that St. Patrick is said to have banished
all snakes and reptiles forever from the Emerald Isle.
   Now, many local people say, a new menace has arrived in the form
of international mining companies, crawling all over western
Ireland looking for gold.
   Croagh Patrick is one of Irelan's holiest sites and thousands of
pilgrims climb its 2,500 feet every July to pay homage to Ireland's
patron saint at the chapel overlooking the sea. Many are aged or
infirm, some walk for hours barefoot over rocky trails, praying or
chanting.
   Now fears of an Irish Klondike have been provoked by the
discovery of rich gold deposits on the slopes of Croagh Patrick and
other nearby mountains.
   At least one company has found gold in quantities of up to 6.7
ounces per ton. Industry experts say gold _ worth about $360 an
ounce _ becomes commercially viable at about a half ounce per ton.
   Opposing the mining companies and government are
environmentalists and local residents, thousands of whom have
attended protest meetings and rallies.
   ``Christ, when the money men wormed their way into the temple in
Jerusalem, rose in anger and cast them headlong out. Let us cast
the money men from our temple,'' resident Anne Parker wrote in a
recent letter read to a protest meeting in Tully Cross.
   Croagh Patrick ``belongs to all Christian people, we in the West
are its special guardians,'' she wrote.
   The companies say they are conducting environmental impact
studies, and deny their operations would harm the environment. The
government says the protests are premature and it has made no
decision yet to grant mining licenses.
   It also points out that mining could create jobs in an area
where unemployment is about 20 percent.
   But locals accuse the government of being too cozy with the
companies. They note that Prime Minister Charles Haughey's son,
Conor, is managing director of Feltrim Mining, one of the 19
companies searching around Croagh Patrick.
   The protesters say the rush to extract gold _ a process that
commonly employs cyanide and can be done by stripping _ could
gravely threaten the sacred mountain and also undermine farming,
fishing and tourism, western Ireland's economic pillars.
   Mining, they say, would destroy one of the cleanest and most
striking places in Europe. Cyanide runoff could poison the
crystalline waterways of Mayo and Galway counties and kill the
foxes, ferrets, badgers, rabbits, fish, seals and hundreds of
species of birds that live in one of Europe's last remaining areas
of blanket bogland.
   ``Sometimes a balance has to be struck between beauty and
material gain,'' wrote Joseph Cassidy, Archbishop of Tuam, in a
recent letter in the Irish Times.
   ``Beutiful places are gifts from God,'' he wrote. ``As such it
is not just a local preserve, but a national, even international
inheritance.''
   Emer Colleran, chairman of Ireland's national trust, is
concerned about the future of a valley and lake, well known to
local salmon fishermen, called Doolough where the British company
Andaman Resources and Glencar Explorations of Ireland have found
gold.
   ``It is one of Ireland's major treasures,'' she said. ``It is
remote, untouched, a wilderness like you rarely find anymore,
without a telephone pole or any other sign of human activity.
   ``The lake looks black on gray days and it is quite magically
gloomy and dark. When the sun shines, it is absolutely transformed
with the lake a sapphire blue against the soft brown mountains,''
she said.
   Although she does not oppose mining in general, she would like
Doolough declared a national park.
   Eddie Phelan, a Department of Energy spokesman, said: ``The
government is committed to the active investigation of the
country's mineral potential and the development of commercial ore
... subject to environmental safeguards, as an important source of
economic growth and employment opportunity.''
   The companies say they understand local concerns, but accuse
outsiders of misrepresenting their plans.
   ``Everyone says the environment is very important and we
agree,'' said Michael Murphy, chairman of Birman Mining, the
company licensed to prospect on Croagh Patrick. ``Mining and
environmental protection are not mutually exclusive.''

   Jerry Nachman, a columnist for the New York Post
and a veteran of the city's media wars, was named the newspaper's
editor Wednesday.
   Nachman, 43, spent most of his career in broadcast journalism
before joining the Post as a columnist early last year.
   He succeeds Jane Amsterdam, who was relieved of her duties
Tuesday by Post owner and publisher Peter Kalikow after 50 weeks in
the position, Kalikow said in a statement.
   Nachman will be a vice president of the New York Post Co. and is
expected to be elected to the newspaper's board of directors, the
statement said.
   Before joining the Post, the New York native was general manager
of the NBC-owned television station in Washington, news director of
WNBC-TV, vice president for news for the NBC-owned stations and a
reporter for WCBS-TV and WCBS-AM.
   Nachman worked for newspapers in Ohio before returning to New
York and beginning his broadcast career.
   Ms. Amsterdam's departure, according to Post spokesman Howard
Rubenstein, was brought on not by any specific problem but by
Kalikow's desire to ``take the Post to the next level.''

<TEXT>
   Claiming to have a bomb, two unarmed
Haitians tried to hijack an Antillean Airlines jet to Israel on
Wednesday and were seized when it landed and passengers rushed for
exits, authorities said.
   The two had boarded the DC-9 in Haiti, apparently thinking it
was bound for New York when its true destination was this tiny
Dutch island off the coast Venezuela, said airline spokesman Robin
Visser.
   He said one of the jet's more than 100 passengers was slightly
injured in the rush to leave the plane after it landed at Hato
International Airport around dusk.
   Visser said the flight originated in Miami and that an
undetermined number of U.S. citizens were aboard Flight 974.
   After its stopover in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, one of the suspects
told flight attendents that a small box he placed in a forward
bathroom had explosives inside that could be detonated by a Haitian
army colonel in a submarine somewhere in the Caribbean.
   He and his companion demanded to be flown to Tel Aviv, Israel,
Visser said.
   The spokesman said the hijackers apparently thought they were on
a flight to New York and the pilot continued on to Curacao without
telling passengers of the attempted hijacking, having convinced the
Haitians they bound for New York.
   The pilot taxied to a far end of the airstrip, informed the
passengers there was an emergency and ordered them off the plane as
quickly as possible.
   Visser said that as people rushed for the exits in panic, an ALM
employee who was aboard as a regular passenger jumped one of the
Haitians, who surrendered, and another Haitian man was arrested on
the tarmac.
   Local authorities had blocked roads leading to the airport and
stopped all flights shortly before the plane landed in Curacao.
   Explosives experts from the Royal Dutch Navy based in Curacao
searched the plane, but Visser did not know whether they had found
anything.
   Visser said the pilot dropped altitude from 29,000 feet to 3,000
feet to lessen the chance of an explosion being set off by cabin
pressure.

   Jim Wright, never comfortable on television,
talked directly to the House. He waved documents. He held aloft his
famous book. He wiped his brow. He spoke an hour and at the end,
almost in a mumble, said that he would quit.
   Off in the Republican seats sat Newt Gingrich, gadfly from
Georgia, Wright's nemesis. When the House stood to applaud Wright,
Gingrich rose, too, but didn't clap. Beside him, Republican leader
Bob Michel offered a sad shake of his head. He had witnessed a
generational change, and he is of the old generation. Gingrich's
the new.
   Wright's speech was nothing fancy, a detailed point by point
rejoinder to the bill of particulars laid out against him by the
ethics committee.
   He belittled the $3.25 per-copy royalty received on the book
that had been sold in wholesale lots to lobbyists. He said his
wife, Betty, had earned her $18,000 salary. They had paid for their
condominium ``per diem,'' said Wright, irate. He produced someone's
affidavit, and put it in the record.
   He defended hiring a young man convicted of assaulting a young
woman and said he had not inquired into the details of the crime
and thought redemption was still a respectable American principle.
   The speaker had wanted his day in court before his peers and he
had it. By the end, the television networks, with no drama to match
this, tuned in.
   In Wright's audience was Lloyd Bentsen, who came over from the
Senate to be with a Texas colleague; Tony Coelho of California, the
Democrats' super fund raiser who stunned his party during the
weekend by resigning to avoid going through the same ethics
wringer; Bill Gray of Philadelphia, who saw his chance to become
the first black to climb into the House leadership endangered by
leaked word of an FBI investigation involving his office.
   Wife Betty Wright sat in the gallery with jutted chin. The
venerated Mo Udall, D-Ariz., just out of the hospital, suffering
from Parkinson's disease, took off his glasses, leaned forward to
catch Wright's words.
   Tom Foley, D-Wash., awesomely popular with both parties,
articulate and modern where Wright is old fashioned, a teddybear on
television, presided. He is destined to become speaker next week,
when Wright leaves.
   Bentsen sat mournful, distracted. Coelho had the look of a man
reprieved. Gray dangled his loafered foot in the aisle, rushed up
to Wright when the speech was over, gave him a bearhug.
   Before the speech, the Texas Democrats had lunch with Wright, a
solemn affair, all said. They posed for a picture before adjourning.
   In the hours anticipating the speech, David Obey, D-Wis., idly
toying with a pocketknife, spoke of the Foley speakership even
before it started. `'The World War II generation is gone, now,'' he
said.
   A House reformer, father of the new ethics rules, Obey glowed
over Foley's prospects. ``He is a superb detail man, a Soviet
scholar,'' he said.
   From the old guard came the voice of Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas,
who said he had warned back in 1977 that creating a Committee of
Standards of Official Conduct _ congressmen judging congressmen _
would lead to ruin and disarray. He had cast one of the 10 votes
against it.
   Freshman Ben Jones, D-Ga., said surely the House had seen worse
moments. ``They had people come at each other in duels here,'' he
said. ``This building has been burned to the ground. Much worse has
happened.''
   If history was being made here, through it all, the American
tourists _ almost to the man, woman and child dressed uniformly in
shorts _ were oblivious. They marched past rows of statues of the
forgotten famous, past Zachariah Chandler of Michigan and J.L.M.
Curry of Alabama, ``statesman, educator, patriot, orator.''
   A woman in the visitor's gallery, told Wright was about to make
a speech and then resign, said, ``Goody.''

   Thousands of women are being kidnapped and sold
to farmers in Hebei province, where hundreds of people are getting
rich through the illegal human trade, an official newspaper
reported today.
   Farmers in Quyang county have paid from $13 to $1,340 each for
about 5,000 women abducted from more than 10 provinces, the
English-language China Daily reported. Apparently, although the
story did not say, the farmers were buying wives.
   More than 1,000 people are engaged in the lucrative business,
including one who built a five-room house with his earnings, the
report said, quoting the China's Women's News.
   Sales of women also are prevalent in other counties around
Baoding city of Hebei, about 90 miles south of Beijing, the report
said.
   It told the tale of Wang Guaifa, 47, who lost both his daughter
and niece to kidnappers in Baoding in January.
   They were abducted after arriving at the Baoding railway station
by a gang of seven in two rickshaws. The gang robbed Wang and ran
off with the women, who were sold in Lianzhuang township of
Xingtang county for a total of $1,520.
   Police were informed of the abduction and found Wang's niece on
March 9. By the time they caught up with his kidnapped daughter she
had been sold three times.
   But according to the report, ``she refused to leave and the
villagers stopped police from taking her away.''

   The partying aboard the cruise ship St.
Louis stopped when Cuba and the United States refused to allow 937
Jews fleeing Germany to land and start a life beyond the grip of
Nazi persecution.
   To commemorate the ``Voyage of the Damned'' 50 years later,
Herbert Karliner has tracked down about 70 fellow survivors.
   Organizers of the anniversary plan to sink the remains of Adolf
Hitler's yacht, the Ostwind, off Miami Beach on Sunday as an
artificial reef. The Ostwind has been decaying in Jacksonville for
decades as various owners have considered plans to restore it.
   The yacht Florida Princess will carry about 25 St. Louis
passengers on Sunday to the approximate point where the St. Louis
was shooed away by the U.S. Coast Guard on June 4, 1939. But this
time, the travelers will receive a Coast Guard escort before
docking in Miami Beach.
   ``We must have been very close because I could see the palm
trees,'' said Karliner, a retired baker who was 12 at the time.
   Telegrams from the ship to President Roosevelt and other world
leaders went unanswered as the passengers tried desperately to find
refuge. The ship received orders to return to Germany _ events
dramatized in the 1975 movie ``Voyage of the Damned'' starring Faye
Dunaway and Max von Sydow.
   Two days from a German port, agreement was reached to split the
passengers among England, France, Netherlands and Belgium, but most
who returned to Europe would die in concentration camps.
   ``We knew what the situation was in Europe for the Jewish
population,'' Karliner said in an interview at his North Miami
home. ``The crossing was wonderful. We were very excited to be out
of Germany.''
   He has snapshots of smiling adults in dressy clothes at a
banquet table and shipboard pals gathered for a children's party on
the trip south.
   But the St. Louis would dock in Havana harbor before most of the
passengers learned their travel papers had been voided. Twenty-two
passengers who obtained their documents from the Cuban consulate in
Italy would be allowed to land. But no one else.
   ``There was near panic when we were still in the harbor,'' said
Liesl Loeb, daughter of the chairman of the passenger committee.
   An attorney jumped overboard and remained in a Cuban hospital as
the St. Louis set sail again while the passengers, led by Ms.
Loeb's father, bargained for their future.
   ``These men worked day and night. I don't think my father slept
one full night in our cabin after the crisis began,'' said Ms.
Loeb, a graphic designer in suburban Philadelphia who celebrated
her 11th birthday on the voyage.
   About three-quarters of the passengers were on an immigration
quota system to enter the United States from three months to three
years later, said Rabbi Simcha Freedman of Miami Beach, who
researched the cruise in conjunction with the anniversary.
   ``The message they sent to Hitler was we view the Jewish issue
as a side issue to world peace. Were they ever wrong,'' said Rabbi
Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Weisenthal Center for
Holocaust Studies.
   Many of the Jewish men aboard were released from concentration
camps for the trip on the condition they not return.
   ``We felt we were free again, but that didn't last long,
especially for those who went to Holland, Belgium and France,''
said Karliner, who grew up in a part of Polish Silesia that is now
in East Germany.
   Karliner, who survived the war working on a French farm under a
false name, was bitter about U.S. treatment of St. Louis passengers
but emigrated with his brother in 1947.
   ``Where else? France treated us also very badly. A lot of people
were so pro-Nazi at the time,'' he said. ``I felt first of all that
the U.S. is the only country where there is really democracy.''
   His work with a Holocaust study group encouraged him to pursue
an anniversary observance for the St. Louis.
   Karliner located survivors as far away as Australia and England,
but most will be coming from the United States.
   ``The story of the St. Louis, the tragic voyage that it took,
gives us a chance to focus in not so much on the horror that would
transpire afterward, but on the actual reasons why the Holocaust
came about,'' said Cooper.

   Cybill Shepherd and Victoria Principal were
among the celebrities who turned out for the West Coast premiere of
the ``Phantom of the Opera'' at the Ahmanson Theater.
   Miss Shepherd arrived with her 9-year-old daughter, Clementine
Ford, for the musical spectacular created by Andrew Lloyd Webber.
   Cher, Tom Selleck, Dudley Moore, Patrick Swayze, Richard
Chamberlain, Gene Kelly and Sammy Davis Jr. also were expected for
the opening-night show, publicist Ann Abrams said.
   The big names also were invited to the Shrine Auditorium for a
post-performance gala with the cast, including Tony Award-winner
Michael Crawford, who plays the phantom, Ms. Abrams said.
   The ``Phantom'' is a tale of a disfigured musician's unrequited
love for a beautiful singer, set in a labyrinthine Paris Opera
House and staged with Webber's characteristic awesomeness.
   Ticket sales to the show, which opened in London in 1987 and New
York last year, have been so brisk in Los Angeles that the
production is expected to stay at least two years, Ms. Abrams said.

The decision was made public Wednesday.
   In 1976, Congress compelled broadcasters and program owners to

<HEAD>Democrats Wonder Whether Truce Will Follow Speaker's Resignation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright
removes a heavy political weight from Democrats, but also leaves
open the question of whether the ``mindless cannibalism'' he warned
against may consume others in an era of heightened public concern
over ethics.
   Majority Democrats may have cause for concern, too, with a newly
aggressive Republican minority hoping to parlay the ethics issue
into success at the polls.
   A sense of unease lingered in the Capitol even after the
widespread relief over the Texan's announcement Wednesday, a
decision everyone had known for weeks was coming.
   Wright's supporters were bitter, and some vowed revenge on the
Republicans.
   One obvious potential target is Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia,
who some Democrats say skirted ethical standards with publication
of his own book. Gingrich, Wright's earliest and most vocal
accuser, slipped out of the Capitol without talking to reporters
after the speaker's resignation speech.
   Wright himself called for a truce in the ethics war that has
claimed him and the No. 3 House Democratic leadership official,
Rep. Tony Coelho of California, and holds the potential for
wounding a number of others. Coelho stunned the House last week
with his announcement that he would resign rather than face an
ethics investigation into his own personal finances.
   Democratic Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., summed up Wright's
parting words this way: ``a warning: stop attempting to get each
other, stop looking for retribution and vengeance.''
   Wright also said it is time to change the rules and procedures
that led to his political demise before his case ever went to
trial. ``Maybe the whole process needs some change and
clarification,'' he said.
   But so far, the victims have all been Democrats, and Republicans
may be forgiven if they have trouble understanding why they should
agree to a cease-fire in a war they are winning.
   After all, Democratic caucus chairman William Gray of
Pennsylvania, hoping to move up on the leadership ladder, has been
told that investigators are looking into questions about the
running of his office. He insists he is not a target of any
investigation and is cooperating with officials. But his irate
complaint over news leaks of the inquiry are eloquent testimony to
his fears of becoming a political casualty.
   Government sources also say a grand jury in Washington, D.C. is
beginning to look into the hiring practices in the office of Walter
Fauntroy, a non-voting delegate for the District of Columbia. And
sources close to that investigation say it has raised questions
about the son of Illinois Democratic Rep. Gus Savage.
   None of this is nearly enough to challenge the Democrats'
34-year control over the levers of power in the House. But it's a
gift from the Republican point of view.
   After all, few believed anything would come of it when Gingrich
first announced his intention, in December 1987, to file a formal
ethics complaint against the speaker. Wright was the nation's top
elected Democrat, and many believed that the ethics committee _
rather than Wright _ would flinch from confrontation.
   That changed when the committee last July hired Richard J.
Phelan, a Chicago lawyer and an active Democrat, to run its
investigation. Phelan brought a non-Washington perspective to the
job, and while Wright's defenders said he was overzealous and out
of control, a majority of the committee believed otherwise.
   As Wright recited the charges and defended himself point by
point on Wednesday, they did seem to some members too petty to
cause an end to such a long and successful career.
   ``After 35 years of effective and able service to his state and
to the nation, Jim deserves better than this,'' said Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, who listened to his colleague's hour-long speech
in the House chamber.
   But it also was true that Wright provided the grist for a long
investigation. He had a history of entering financial ventures on
tips and aid from friends, and of skating close to, if not over,
the line of ethical propriety. Those friends often appeared to have
more than friendship in mind when they courted the favor of a
powerful and rising congressman.
   In the end, that ethical line seemed to have shifted under him.
Wright was the product of a Texas morality of the wildcatting
1950s, sharing more in common with Lyndon Johnson than with Ralph
Nader. Some of his colleagues say he failed to adjust quickly
enough to the changing ethics climate in Washington.
   But to others, Wright was a victim of a partisan attack, a
coordinated blitzkrieg orchestrated by Republicans with consummate
skill. ``We have carried negative campaigning into the
post-election period,'' said one Democratic lawmaker who has
followed Wright's case closely.
   Some Democrats are prepared to respond in kind.
   ``They're going to be sorry they've set this in motion,'' said
Rep. Frank J. Guarini, D-N.J.
   If Republicans are fearful, they don't sound it.
   ``The resignation of two of the top three Democrats in the House
is the bitter fruit of 35 years of Democrat control of that body,''
said a paper prepared by the GOP congressional campaign committee
for use by GOP lawmakers. ``The Democrats in the House have grown
arrogant with their unchallenged power.''

   House members, shaken by Jim Wright's
resignation speech, say their chamber has become a partisan ``war
zone'' and wonder whether political bickering will rage on despite
the speaker's call for a truce.
   ``There's an evil wind blowing in the halls of Congress today
that is reminiscent of the Spanish Inquisition,'' Rep. Jack Brooks
said Wednesday in likening the ethics charges that felled Wright to
cruel punishments against Spaniards accused of heresy in 1478.
   The mood described by the House Judiciary Committee chairman was
echoed by others, but lawmakers generally expressed hope that
members would heed Wright's plea in his speech to the House: ``Let
us not try to get even with each other.''
   Wright's emotional resignation speech culminated a yearlong,
$1.5 million investigation by the ethics committee into the Texas
Democrat's financial dealings. The formal probe began with charges
filed against Wright by Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia _
now his party's whip _ and culminated in committee allegations of
69 rules violations.
   Even supporters said they backed Wright's decision to quit,
stating the ethics cloud hanging over him would have made it
impossible for Wright to remain an effective leader.
   The speaker was praised by Democrats and Republicans alike.
President Bush, in a message from London, referred to their shared
home state of Texas and said: ``In spite of the present situation,
I believe the Wright tenure was one of effectiveness and dedication
to the Congress of the United States.''
   But the words of praise were spiked with partisan bitterness,
especially toward Gingrich, who watched the speech stoically from
the fourth row of the Republican side of the chamber.
   If Gingrich ``wants to engage in open warfare, there will be a
Democratic response'' came the blunt warning from Rep. Bill
Richardson, D-N.M. He said partisan bickering has made the House a
``war zone, not a legislative body. Both sides have had enough.''
   Gingrich ducked out of the House chamber and avoided reporters
after Wright's speech.
   Other lawmakers issued more general warnings to all their
colleagues.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., urged members to ``stop turning this
place into Beirut.''
   Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, former chairman of the ethics
committee, warned that if the present mood remains ``the end result
will be to destroy this institution, the end result will be to
destroy this institution as we know it today.''
   A more optimistic note was sounded by a staunch Wright defender,
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who said Wright's ``parting gift was a
warning to stop'' the vengeance.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, praised
Wright's accomplishments on issues including trade, welfare reform
and civil rights.
   ``Every American whose company is able to compete overseas,
every retiree who need no longer fear paying a crippling medical
bill, will owe a substantial debt of gratitude to Speaker Wright,''
Mitchell said.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the resignation comes at a time
that ``young people are saying, why should I go into government?
Why should I lay my whole life bare for something that may be
destructive to me personally? An awful lot of us are hearing that
sort of thing from our children.''

   An Iowa Air turbo-prop plane slid up to 300 yards
on its belly when its its landging gears collapsed during a
landing, officials said.
   Two pilots and one passenger were aboard Wednesday's Flight 1523
for Benton Harbor, Mich. No injuries were reported.
   The plane had just left Midway Airport when the pilot noticed a
problem with the landing gear and returned, said Mort Edelstein, a
Federal Aviation Administration spokesman.
   When it landed, the landing gears collapsed, and the plane slid
up to 300 yards along the runway, said Chicago Aviation Department
spokeswoman Lisa Howard. It came to rest at the intersection of two
main runways, she said.
   Though runways for small aircraft were not affected, Midway's
two runways for large commercial flights were closed for two hours
until the twin-engine E110 turbo-prop could be towed away, she said.

   An explosion and fire broke out on an oil
rig in Cook Inlet, seriously injuring three of the 41 people
aboard, authorities said.
   The explosion occurred Wednesday on a Unocal Corp. Monopod
platform about 15 miles northeast of Nikiski, said Bob Anderson, a
company spokesman.
   The fire was extinguished in about 15 minutes, Anderson said.
   All safety mechanisms functioned and no oil was involved, said
Anderson.
   ``There was no spill,'' he said.
   Forty-one people were on the rig when the fire broke out, he
said. All but seven were evacuated by helicopter to Kenai, 10 miles
south of Nikiski. Those remaining aboard were investigating what
went wrong, Anderson said.
   The three injured workers suffered second- and third-degree
burns were were listed in serious condition at a hospital in
Anchorage, 70 miles northeast of Kenai, officials said.
   The rig, one of more than a dozen platforms in Cook Inlet, was
installed in 1966 and first produced oil in January 1967. The unit
equipped with living quarters for 54 people rises 354 feet from the
inlet floor.
   In 1987, a well blowout and fire turned a Cook Inlet oil and gas
production platform into a huge, gas-fueled torch. All 49 workers
on the Steelhead platform owned by Marathon Oil Co. and Unocal
escaped safely. Repair of the platform is continuing.

   Camelot it's not.
   Nevertheless, the prison in this pastoral town is staging a
production of the musical legend. The all-inmate cast has dubbed
themselves the ``Awesome Convict Players.''
   One Massachusetts Correctional Institution prisoner asked that
his parole be delayed so he could play the role of Sir Lancelot on
opening night Friday, officials said.
   During a dress rehearsal Wednesday, the cast proudly displayed
the scenery they had painted, the addition to the stage built in
the prison carpentry shop and the tunics and robes they sewed under
the tutelage of a volunteer costume mistress.
   ``I'm sure from the outside it seems funny because `Camelot' is
supposed to be a perfect world, and doing it in a prison is such an
irony,'' said Holly Ward, the 28-year-old director.
   But Ward, who is not an inmate, and her actors say prison
theater is therapeutic.
   ``Camelot is a way to reassess your dreams and maybe to live out
your dreams in some way,'' said one inmate who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The inmate, like others in the cast, wouldn't say what crime he
committed for his one-year sentence.
   The buildings at Shirley, 40 miles northwest of Boston, are used
as a minimum-security prison aimed at reintegrating inmates who are
soon to be released. Many are serving time for drug and alcohol
offenses, but some are finishing longer sentences for more violent
crimes.
   There are no bars, fences or dogs. Prisoners so close to
regaining their freedom rarely escape.
   Ward said her biggest problem is actors who keep being released
just when they've mastered their roles.
   ``We've been through three Arthurs and several Merlins and
several Mordreds,'' she said.
   Ward and Jim Kelley, the prison's community service director,
said they were stunned when inmate Gordon Benjamin decided to delay
his release so he could play the first knight of the Round Table.
Five performances are scheduled through June 10.
   Benjamin was not at Wednesday's rehearsal and did not return
telephone calls to The Associated Press.
   ``I've never seen a parole put off for this,'' Kelley said.
``That's major.''
   Ward began organizing inmate plays when she was a theater-arts
student seven years ago. She said she isn't quitting despite the
birth of her first child last fall.
   Several years ago, Ward directed ``Man of La Mancha'' at Norfolk
prison and persuaded the Broadway lead, actor Richard Kiley, to
attend. This time, she has invited Robert Goulet, who played
Lancelot in the film version of ``Camelot'' starring Vanessa
Redgrave and Richard Burton.
   She believes acting helps the inmates develop self-esteem and a
perspective on their own emotions.
   ``Some of them, I have to teach them how to cry,'' she said.
``Then I have to teach them how to stop.''
   The inmates said they love the romance, the costumes, the
chivalry and the story of King Arthur's betrayal and forgiveness.
   The man who plays the villain, Arthur's bastard son Mordred,
said he can relate to the character because he himself is an
illegitimate child.
   ``Camelot,'' which will cost less than $500 to produce, is
supported by a grant from Massachusetts Citizens Against the Death
Penalty, Kelley said. The cast will give performances for fellow
inmates, town residents, staff and state dignitaries, and on
closing night, for family and friends.
   ``Their families are so proud of them,'' Ward said. ``It's the
first time they can say, `I saw my son on stage' instead of `My son
the criminal, my son the prisoner.'''

   This is not your ordinary
office plant.
   A persistent ivy vine that once climbed only the front of the
southern New Jersey township's building inspections office made its
way indoors about five years ago through a crack in the wall and
apparently found it a good growing environment.
   The vine now is in several offices, lining the perimeter and the
ceiling of the room it first entered and making its way up a dark
stairwell toward offices on the second floor.
   Workers have allowed the vine's offshoots to wind their way to
the fire inspections office and out to the customer service area
counter, where a sign proclaims, ``Yes! The ivy you see is real!''
   When it came inside, no one saw reason to prune it. In fact, the
employees marked its progress with small slips of paper.
   ``It broke through the bricks and came popping up one day,''
said secretary Pat Chatigny. ``I'm sitting here typing one day and
I looked up and saw the green coming out and we just decided to
tack it up and let it grow.''

   Dan Eisaman has found an unusual way to
harness the wind for sailing _ a kite.
   Eisaman, 55, plans to sail Lake Superior in a canoe using a kite
overhead to power him across. It's the only one of the Great Lakes
he hasn't navigated with a kite.
   ``No turning back, no second thoughts,'' he said. He intends to
begin sailing today and hopes to complete the 130-mile journey by
Friday.
   During a recent practice run, the 16-square-foot red, yellow and
blue kite soared high above the 15-foot canoe. ``If the wind blows
that way, you go that way. Just follow the wind,'' said Eisaman,
who writes technical manuals for computers with his wife.
   Only about a dozen people in the world regularly kite sail, said
David Culp, publisher of the Kite Sailing International newsletter.
   ``I know a lot of people think Dan Eisaman is just a nutty old
guy who's trying to get himself killed in a novel way,'' said Culp,

   The owner of Chevy's Cafe plans one last
bash before changing the eatery's name, under a threat of a
trademark infringement lawsuit by General Motors Corp.
   To commemorate the name change to Flip's Cafe, employees and
patrons will destroy a battered 1957 Chevy in the restaurant's
parking lot tonight with a sledgehammer.
   Owner Dennis Richards contends the name Chevy's was chosen
simply to convey a 1950s image. Portage is about 135 miles west of
Detroit.
   ``They sent us a letter the first week in April indicating that
they were going to sue us if the name wasn't changed,'' Richards
said of GM.
   Chevrolet spokeswoman Mary McElyea said the company has started
to get more protective of its name as a trademark. She said GM also
has contacted about 15 to 20 other restaurants nationwide that use
company trademark names.
   ``We got letters from stockholders and chapters of Mothers
Against Drunk Driving asking GM why they'd support establishments
that serve alcohol,'' McElyea said.

<HEAD>About 4,000 Missing Library Books Returned Anonymously</HEAD>

   Thousands of books whose absence was
undetected by librarians have returned, solving a mystery that
Brown County Library didn't know it had.
   Because the library has yet to complete an automated inventory
system, employees were unaware many of the books had left the
shelves without being checked out, library director Patricia La
Violette said.
   About 4,000 have been returned in a rush of deposits to night
book drops during the past three weeks. Hundreds were left during
the Memorial Day weekend.
   Ms. La Violette said the books began showing up after she got a
telephone call May 8 from a weeping woman. She said the caller
related her mother had died, leaving behind a large number of
stolen library books.
   Ms. La Violette said the woman did not identify herself. The
library declined comment about the book returns for several weeks
because it did not want to discourage the recovery, she said.
   Most of the books are romances, mysteries and popular novels.
Others are hardback non-fiction works.
   Ms. La Violette said more than half the books did not contain
the bar-code stickers used in the library's inventory system,
meaning they were taken before the coding system was established
four years ago.
   She said the library planned to request an electronic security
system even before the books began showing up.

<TEXT>
   Memorial services to honor the late
U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper were scheduled for his Miami district and
the capital of the state he represented in Washington for more than
40 years.
   Congress, meanwhile, formally accorded Pepper the honor of lying
in state today in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, which has been granted
previously to only 26 Americans. His House colleagues paid tribute
to him as a ``national treasure'' and as ``Mr. Senior Citizen'' for
his work on behalf of the elderly.
   Pepper, 88, died of stomach cancer Tuesday at Walter Reed Army
Hospital in Washington.
   A viewing was scheduled at Central Baptist Church in Miami on
Saturday afternoon, followed by a memorial service Sunday
afternoon. Another viewing will be held in the rotunda of the old
state Capitol in Tallahassee on Sunday evening.
   Pepper will be buried Monday in Tallahassee's Oakland Cemetery,
alongside his wife, Mildred, who died of cancer in 1979.
   Gov. Bob Martinez urged the Legislature to name the state's new
Department of Education building in honor of Pepper.
   ``It would be fitting to name this important building in state
government after a man who, decade after decade, stood tall for the
interests of the people he served,'' said Martinez.
   Pepper's body was to lie in state in the nation's capital for
five hours this afternoon. A resolution approving the honor was
approved by the House, 397-0, on Wednesday. The Senate approved it
on a voice vote.
   ``He developed that innate human sympathy that identified with
the problems of people who are suffering,'' House Speaker Jim
Wright told the chamber before announcing his own resignation.
``Claude Pepper was a voice for the voiceless. He offered a helping
hand to the helpless.''
   Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., recalled the scene when President
Bush went to Walter Reed last Thursday to present Pepper with the
nation's highest civilian award, the Medal of Freedom.
   ``Despite what was obviously a great deal of pain, Claude
apologized to the president and first lady that he couldn't stand
up,'' Conte said.
   ``He didn't have to stand up,'' Conte said. ``He was a giant.''
   Pepper was to be only the second incumbent member of the House
to lie in state in the rotunda. The first was Rep. Thaddeus
Stevens, R-Pa., in 1868. The last member of Congress so honored was
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, D-Minn., in 1978.
   He joins an honor roster that includes presidents and military
leaders and the unknown dead chosen to represent Americans killed
in four of America's wars.
   Martinez declined to comment on a date for a special election to
fill Pepper's seat until services are concluded.

   Residents of the city Jim Wright
represented for 34 years expressed little surprise that he resigned
as House speaker, but expressed sorrow and fear about the loss of
political clout they will suffer.
   ``There's no question this is a tremendous loss for the
community. Anybody who knows anything of the American political
process knows the loss of the speakership is a major loss for this
area,'' said Mayor Bob Bolen, whose community has long counted
Wright as a major asset in attracting defense jobs.
   Stinging from an ethics investigation of his business dealings
and sales of a book, Wright told the House on Wednesday he would
resign by the end of June.
   People gathered around the televisions in an electronics shop at
a shopping mall to watch Wright's hourlong nationally broadcast
speech.
   ``I think it's horrible,'' said Lynn Bratcher. ``He's ... the
only one that has ever really done anything for anyone for Texas.
   ``I think it's a shame and disgrace that the news media has
challenged his integrity.''
   Staffers at Wright's office here said they listened to his
resignation speech, but refused to talk about it.
   ``All I can say is, the speaker has spoken, and he speaks for
us,'' said Larry Shannon, director of the office who with the
backing of two security guards turned reporters away.
   Inside, his staff appeared to be carrying on business as usual.
   At another federal office, workers turned on the radio and
cheered as Wright spoke.
   One woman yelled ``Touche!'' as Wright dismissed the House
ethics committee's charges that he violated congressional rules 69
times.
   But minutes later, they fell silent as Wright said, ``I give you
back this job ...,'' promising to give up the speaker's post and
then his seat sometime in June.
   At Bailey's Bar-B-Q across the street from the federal offices,
talk was about daily business, not Wright's problems. But patrons
gave varied responses when asked their opinions.
   ``In my opinion, it probably was the best thing for him,'' said
Deborah Frazier. ``He's had his day. I think he should resign to
save face.''
   ``I'm glad he's going because they need to get it all
straightened out,'' said Bruce Westrick. ``I just think he got
caught.''
   Ken Fowler said Wright got ``chopped up''by the media, adding,
``You can find something wrong in anyone, if you go looking for
it.''
   Some state politicians believe Wright's resignation could damage
Texas' fragile economic recovery that has become dependent on
billions of dollars in government contracts.
   Gov. Bill Clements, Texas' only 20th century Republican
governor, said the Fort Worth Democrat had represented the state
well.
   ``This is not a good day for Texas,'' Clements said. ``As
speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Jim Wright proved to
be one of the state's most valuable assets and a great national
leader. He brought jobs and opportunities to Texas, and he always
remembered that his roots were in Texas.''
   In Weatherford, the ranching town about 30 miles west of Forth
Worth where Wright grew up and served as mayor in 1950-54, Mayor
Sherry Watson said his resignation was ``truly awful.''
   Officials said it may be impossible to rebuild the political
power or match the economic gain the region enjoyed from Wright's
34-year tenure and his leadership in the Democratic Party.
   Although Wright urged his colleagues against seeking retribution
on his account, Texas Democratic Party Chairman Bob Slagle said:
``Unless some substantial reciprocal gesture is made by
Republicans, I must confess that Jim Wright has a much more
charitable and Christian outlook towards this than I have.''

   Businessman George Mallick has no plans
to offer Betty Wright another job now that her husband has resigned
as House speaker.
   ``I don't believe I can afford her,'' he said. ``Aside from Jim
Wright, she's a capable businesswoman. She's been in business all
her life. The only reason she worked for $18,000 a year was because
she owned half the company.''
   Mallick, 54, said Wednesday in an interview at his office that
no basis exists for allegations that Mrs. Wright might have been
paid only as a courtesy to Wright for potential political influence.
   Dogged by an ethics investigation of his business dealings and
sales of a book, Wright said Wednesday he would step down from his
leadership post next week and leave Congress by the end of June.
   Even though Mrs. Wright has not worked for him in four years,
Mallick said, her encouragement and influence has left a positive
imprint on those who still work for his real estate development
company.
   ``I didn't get a bargain,'' said Mallick of Mrs. Wright's
$18,000 salary. ``I got a windfall.''
   Mallick said he was asked by the House ethics committee for
evidence that Mrs. Wright had worked for him, and he responded by
providing reports and brochures she had written. He said
allegations against her were a ``cheap shot.''
   ``She found investment opportunities and discussed them with
me,'' Mallick said.
   Mallick challenged the news media to ask the committee to
provide the undisclosed testimony and evidence involving the Wright
investigation, despite the Texas congressman's decision to resign.
   ``I want you to go out and dig up the truth,'' he said.
   That truth, he said, will vindicate Wright.
   Mallick said he didn't expect to hear from Wright on Wednesday,
but anticipated a call tonight: ``I want to say to him, `I
understand. I know what you've done. I know why you did it.'''
   At first, Mallick said he was surprised and shocked as he
watched Wright's announcement, but he agreed with Wright as the
veteran congressman asked fellow House members to halt ``mindless
cannibalism'' against some lawmakers.
   ``Something has to be done to stop this madness that's going
on,'' Mallick echoed.
   Wright's decision to give up his lifelong dream of being speaker
was not easy, Mallick said, adding that Wright had called him May
21 to ask his advice.
   ``He very truly is a man of peace,'' he said. ``He wants peace
in that House.''
   It was 1963 when a young congressman met a young developer over
a cup of coffee. They shared their dreams and began walking toward
them together.
   ``We were young lions, young Turks,'' said Mallick, sighing as
he looked around his spacious office lined with civic awards.
   ``I did great and he did well,'' Mallick continued.
   Mallick said he never asked Wright to vote a certain way on any
legislation nor did he ask him to intercede with any federal agency.
   ``Not that I wouldn't have been entitled to,'' he said. ``I'm a
constituent like anyone else.''
   The Fort Worth developer said he expects Wright to do well in
the future _ although it may not necessarily be in a political
position.
   ``You haven't seen the last of him,'' Mallick said. ``The man's
met world leaders. He speaks fluent Spanish. There'll be a call to
him.''
   Mallick added: ``History will treat him well. It's not over.
He's just going to pause awhile.''

   Authorities expect more arrests after nabbing a
radical environmental group's founder and three other people on
charges they conspired to sabotage two nuclear power plants and an
Energy Department bomb factory.
   The four, and possibly a few others who dubbed themselves the
Evan Mecham Eco-Terrorist International Conspiracy, were plotting
the undertaking when they were arrested Wednesday, the FBI and a
U.S. prosecutor said at a news conference.
   ``This investigation is continuing in Arizona and in several
other states, and additional arrests are anticipated,'' said David
Small, FBI supervisory special agent here.
   He declined to tell reporters when other arrests might be
expected, or how many.
   David Foreman, 42, who in 1979 founded Earth First! _ the
exclamation point is part of the name _ was arrested in Tucson on a
charge of conspiracy. He appeared before a federal magistrate and
was ordered held without bond.
   The three others appeared in Phoenix and were ordered held for
an appearance Friday in U.S. District Court.
   Mark L. Davis, 39, Marc A. Baker, 37, and Margaret Katherine
Millett, 35, all of Prescott, were charged with conspiracy to
sabotage a nuclear plant as well as destruction of an energy
facility, destruction of property used in interstate commerce and
destruction of government property.
   The FBI said Davis and Baker were arrested while trying to cut
down a utility pole supporting a power line that links an
electrical substation with two irrigation pumping stations of the
Central Arizona Project, a multibillion-dollar canal system
bringing Colorado River water to Phoenix and Tucson.
   The group, which took its name from the former Arizona governor
impeached last year, has claimed responsibility for criminal acts
in communiques to news organizations, the FBI said. The
organization's acronym is EMETIC, a medicine that causes vomiting.
   The conspiracy count against Foreman involved a plot to sabotage
the federal government's Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant near
Golden, Colo., and commercial nuclear power plants near San Luis
Obispo, Calif., and at Wintersburg, U.S. Attorney Stephen M.
McNamee said.
   He said EMETIC's first activity was believed to be a May 1986
raid in which someone threw metal-weighted ropes or copper cables
over 500-kilovolt transmission lines leading out of the Palo Verde
nuclear complex at Wintersburg, 50 miles west of Phoenix.
   Coconino County Sheriff Joe Richards said EMETIC took credit for
attempts in October 1987 and October 1988 to saw through a support
pylon at the Fairfield Snow Bowl near Flagstaff.
   ``This is a significant case. I think this is a significant
development in law enforcement; it was a very coordinated effort
over a long period of time,'' McNamee said.
   ``They're trying to make it a significant case,'' said Nancy
Zierenberg, an Earth First! member in Tucson.
   She declined to comment on the arrests but said Earth First!
adherents usually limited themselves to preservationist activities.

   The oldest survivor of the Johnston flood
said she would just as soon forget it, despite the city's efforts
to commemorate the 100th anniversary of one of the nation's worst
natural disasters.
   ``You don't like to remember things like that too long,''
106-year-old Elsie Frum said Wednesday. ``You know you were there.
You wonder why.''
   Mrs. Frum was 6 when she and her family fled to a hilltop and
watched a wall of water roar through Johnstown on May 31, 1889,
killing 2,209 people.
   ``The sharpest memory I have of the flood is running from it,''
she said. ``My dad ran into the house and grabbed me and my
sisters.''
   Mrs. Frum and the only other known survivor, 100-year-old Frank
Shomo, were honored Wednesday evening at the city's annual Flood
Survivors' Banquet.
   Earlier in the day, thousands of residents and visitors attended
dedications, re-dedications and other events commemorating the
flood, the first and worst of three major floods to devastate this
city in the last century. Others occurred in 1936 and 1977.
   ``It's time to honor those who perished in the past,'' said
Mayor Herbert Pfuhl Jr. ``We're celebrating not a flood or a
disaster, but the resiliency of the community.''
   Johnstowners' determination was evident in the first hours after
the flood when they immediately began clearing debris and
rebuilding the city, said Richard Dill, director of centennial
activities.
   ``That's really the story of Johnstown,'' Dill said.
   Scores of people gathered in Grandview Cemetery in Westmont, a
mountain suburb above the city, for a prayer vigil at the graves of
nearly 700 unidentified flood victims.
   At 4:07 p.m., the time the waters slammed into the city,
hundreds gathered at the confluence of Johnstown's three rivers to
hear a modern diesel locomotive re-create the heroic dash by
Pennsylvania Railroad engineer John Hess, who steamed into the city
with his whistle tied down as a last-minute warning.
   Organizers had scheduled a moment of silence, with church bells
ringing as a cue, but it was interrupted by a Conrail freight train
passing through.
   Still, those present reflected on the disaster.
   ``I think somewhere in the back of everybody's minds there are
those 2,200 people who perished,'' said Chris Butcher, 24, of
nearby Williamsburg.
   Later, Pfuhl and Lt. Gov. Mark Singel lighted a torch that is
meant to become an eternal flame at the rivers' confluence.
   The National Park Service dedicated a $5 million visitors'
center at the site of the dam that unleashed the flood, and the
city re-dedicated the renovated Johnstown Flood Museum.
   The summer-long commemoration, under the theme ``A Triumph of
the Human Spirit,'' highlights the city's comebacks from disaster
and economic adversity.
   The flood occurred after days of rain when the earthen South
Fork Dam collapsed and unleashed 20 million tons of water from a
reservoir that was an exclusive summer resort for millionaire
industrialists Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Mellon,
among others.
   A wall of water up to 70 feet high barreled 14 miles down the
narrow, meandering Little Conemaugh River Valley, sweeping away
early steel mills, wood-frame homes and barns, livestock and people.
   In an hour, the flood thundered into this bustling city,
crushing scores of homes and downtown businesses in a vast
whirlpool that lasted 10 minutes.
   The city, then with about 10,000 people, suffered an estimated
$17 million in damage at a time the average weekly wage was $10. A
worldwide relief effort, led by Clara Barton and her new American
Red Cross, helped to rebuild.
   The nation's only worse natural disaster was a 1900 hurricane
that claimed about 6,000 lives in Galveston, Texas.
   Heavy rain in the Allegheny Mountains caused floods that killed
25 people 1936 and 80 people in 1977.
   Stung by declines in the steel industry, Johnstown's
unemployment rate peaked at 26.6 percent in 1983, at the same time
it had the nation's lowest crime rate.
   The city now has about 35,000 people, and the area's
unemployment rate had fallen to 6.6 percent in March.

   A 17-year-old whose wife is pregnant
says an anti-truancy law has taken away his livelihood as well as
his license, so he plans to take the matter to court with the help
of his father.
   One attorney has predicted that if Michael Means and his father,
William, go through with their lawsuit, the ruling will set a
precedent.
   Under an education reform law passed by the West Virginia
Legislature last summer, students under age 18 who miss more than
10 consecutive days or have 15 unexcused absences must give up
their driving privileges. County school systems notify the
Department of Motor Vehicles of students who have dropped out.
   The measure was the nation's first anti-truancy law to include
revoking teen-agers' drivers licenses.
   ``The law is fair for 16-year-olds and for most people ...
people who are not married,'' said Means, who lost his job as a
Charleston gas attendant after his driving privileges were taken
away.
   ``But for many, I don't think it should be the same. If you
break the law, you pay like an adult, so why not be able to drive
like an adult?''
   Lawmakers in Wisconsin and California approved similar laws, but
Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed California's version. On Wednesday, a
Kentucky legislator introduced a similar bill in that state.
   ``Our first step will go through the circuit court to see if we
can't get this law declared unconstitutional,'' said William Means.
   Department lawyer Tom Madden said if Means and his son file the
suit, it will be the first court test of the law and will set a
standard.
   ``I think this might be a case of first impression. I don't want
to go out on a limb, but this may be the first case in the country.
It will definitely be the first time it reaches this stage in West
Virginia,'' Madden said.
   Means dropped out of Roosevelt Junior High School in Kanawha
County a year ago when he was in ninth grade. He and his wife,
Tonya, 16, are expecting their first child in the fall.
   Means got a license before dropping out and worked as a gas
station attendant. But he misplaced his license in October and had
to quit when the state wouldn't replace it because he was a
dropout. On Tuesday, the DMV affirmed its decision.
   ``There were supposed to be exceptions to this law,'' Means'
father said. ``My son is married, he's an expectant father with the
baby due in September. They have a house on their own, trying to
make it on their own.
   ``With the decision, I see no way for him to gain employment and
support his family. If this isn't an exception, I don't know what
is.''
   Madden said the law allows for hardship cases when the
``withdraw is beyond the control of the student.'' He said that
decision lies with the counties and not the deparment.
   Jim Simmons, associate superintendent of Kanawha County pupil
support services, said the county tries to help the students on an
individual basis.
   ``There was an opportunity in this situation for the student to
finish his education,'' Simmons said.
   Last year, 17.4 percent of West Virginia's high school students
dropped out and in Kanawha County, 14.8 percent left early.

   American office workers are becoming
more frustrated with their jobs and less trusting of management,
according to a survey by Louis Harris.
   The 1989 Office Environment Index, a survey of office worker
attitudes, found 87 percent of office workers believe honesty and
ethical behavior of company management are the most important job
characteristics.
   Only 39 percent think their organization's management met those
standards when dealing with employees, according to the survey
released Wednesday.
   ``Office workers plain just don't trust management to deal
fairly with employees,'' said Harris, who conducted the survey for
furniture manufacturer Steelcase Inc. of Grand Rapids.
   The telephone survey of 1,041 office workers selected at random
was released in New York.
   When unprompted, two-thirds of those surveyed said salary was
the most important job characteristic. But when presented with a
list, 10 items _ the first being ethical management _ were rated as
``very important'' more often than salary.
   ``Our research indicates that the climate of organizational
restructuring, mergers and acquisitions may be contributing to
workers' mistrust of top management,'' Harris said.
   After honesty, workers said the most important job
characteristics were the opportunity to develop skills, the desire
for management to recognize workers' contributions and job security.
   The survey, which also polled 150 top executives of U.S.
corporations, also found many bosses are out of touch with how
their employees perceive their jobs.
   While 49 percent of the workers surveyed said ``they are being
pushed to the wall'' on productivity and are doing as much work as
they reasonably can, only 21 percent of the top executives shared
that view.
   Last year, the survey found worker satisfaction up a bit and saw
signs of a thaw in employee-management relations. The latest survey
showed the proportion of office workers who said they were ``very
satisfied'' had declined 5 percentage points to 41 percent.
   ``This year the mood has begun to sour,'' Harris said.
   Other findings include:
   _The proportion of office workers who see a ``great deal'' of
connection between doing their job well and getting what they most
want out of life was 56 percent, down 3 points from 59 percent.
   _Fifty-eight percent said it's ``very important'' that an
organization have a participatory management style, but only 24
percent said that's ``very true'' on their current job.
   _Of health concerns, 44 percent of the workers said eye strain
was the most serious problem, followed by air quality, radiation
from video display terminals and exposure to hazardous materials.
   The survey found that bosses ``don't really expect the mere
mortals of the office rank-and-file to find their work fulfilling _
and in turn that leaves the bosses without a clue that workers'
productivity might be related to workers' job satisfaction and a
sense of connection between their work and the rest of their
lives,'' Harris said.
   The margin of error was 3 percentage points for the survey,
conducted from Nov. 30 through Jan. 8.

   Eight miners were reported missing
after heavy rains triggered landslides at gold mining tunnels in
the southern Philippines. Officials said today that three people
were killed in a related fire.
   Mario Luis Jacinto, regional director of the Bureau of Mines,
said the incidents occurred Tuesday in the mining town of Mount
Diwalwal in Davao del Norte province, about 580 miles southeast of
Manila.
   Jacinto said the rains loosened soil in the area, causing 13
tunnels to collapse. He said 135 miners were able to leave the
tunnels but eight were reported missing.
   Several Manila radio stations and newspapers reported that as
many as 13 people died and 1,000 others were trapped in the
collapsed tunnels, but Jacinto could not confirm it.
   ``We talked to a number of survivors and residents in the area
but they said the number of missing could not be that high,''
Jacinto said.
   The Diwalwal mining area had occasionally been hit by cave-ins
but most went unreported because miners fear the government will
halt operations there.
   Almost simultaneous with the collapse, Jacinto said, mud caused
a charcoal pit in a blacksmith shop to tumble and ignited a
three-hour fire in a nearby housing area that burned 165 shanties
and 15 houses.
   The fire killed three people and injured nine, he added.

   An altered polio virus displaying part of an
AIDS virus protein may one day work as an AIDS vaccine, researchers
reported today.
   When such a polio virus was created and injected it into
rabbits, the animals made blood proteins that stopped AIDS virus
infection in the test tube, scientists reported.
   The study is among several papers on acquired immune deficiency
syndrome research published in today's issue of the British journal
Nature.
   Vaccines spur the body's immune system into creating proteins
called antibodies that later can attack particular germs. Several
AIDS vaccine strategies are being tried in humans, including the
use of a genetically altered smallpox virus.
   A vaccine using an altered polio virus may lead to antibodies in
such areas as the surface of the vagina, where they might
inactivate the sexually transmitted AIDS virus before it enters the
bloodstream, study co-author Jeffrey Almond said Wednesday in a
telephone interview.
   Almond, of the University of Reading in Britain, and British
colleagues worked with a type of polio virus that is widely used in
the oral polio vaccine.
   It was altered to display part of an AIDS virus protein and
given to rabbits. In the test tube, antibodies from the rabbits'
blood stopped a variety of AIDS virus strains from infecting cells.
   The result is encouraging and ``raises our hopes'' for finding
an effective AIDS vaccine, said an accompanying editorial by Gordon
Ada of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
   A second paper dealt with simian immunodeficiency virus, called
SIV, which causes AIDS-like disease in monkeys.
   Researchers said they found that SIV from a West African monkey
called the sooty mangabey is genetically close to HIV-2, which
causes AIDS in humans in West Africa.
   HIV-2 differs from HIV-1, which causes AIDS in the United States.
   Researchers suggested that SIV from a sooty mangabey or a
closely related species may have infected a human West African
within the past 30 years to 40 years, and then evolved into HIV-2.
   But it is possible that the infection went the other way
instead, with HIV-2 entering the monkey, said the researchers from
the National Institutes of Health, Georgetown University and Tulane
University.
   They also stressed that the proposed time of the infection was
only a rough estimate.

<TEXT>
   A man called the ``handcuff rapist'' was
given a life sentence plus 2,715 years by a judge who said no one
could measure the victims' misery.
   Robert Biddings, 35, pleaded guilty Wednesday to 71 charges of
rape, kidnapping and robbery, as well as to 40 similar charges for
which he was convicted in a jury trial last week.
   He gave up his right to appeal with the guilty pleas.
   ``The bottom line is he's going away for a long time,'' said
Franklin County Prosecutor Michael Miller.
   Biddings is not expected to be eligible for parole for at least
40 years.
   In sentencing Biddings, Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Dana
Deshler said he would make no attempt to lecture him, adding:
   ``Obviously no one will ever be able to measure the amount of
human misery visited upon these women and girls in terms of terror,
physical harm, humiliation. No one will ever be able to measure
that.
   ``I would say to Mr. Biddings (that) ... by his conduct over a
period of years it's my view ... that he has forfeited his right to
live in a free and civilized society.''
   Public defender James Kura said it was Biddings' decision to
plead guilty and avoid a second trial.
   Biddings said nothing in court, but in an interview later with
WBNS-TV he linked his decision to evidence presented at his first
trial.
   ``The whole thing was a setup ... I would have had no chance in
the second trial,'' he said. ``I feel sorry for ... what happened
to (the victims), but there's nothing I can do to change that.''
   One victim in the courtroom characterized Biddings as a
``disgusting dog'' who should have been subject to the death
penalty.
   ``I almost died. He doesn't deserve to live,'' the woman told
reporters.
   Deshler sentenced Biddings to 15 to 25 years in prison on most
of the charges, but he received a mandatory life sentence because
one of the victims was under 13 years old when she was raped.
Biddings received another mandatory 15 years for using a gun in
five of the attacks.
   The attacker was known as the ``handcuff rapist'' because of
restraints used in many of the assaults that occurred from 1984 to
1988.
   Biddings was charged with attacks on 35 people, but the cases
were split into two trials, the second of which had been scheduled
for Sept. 25 in Cincinnati.

<HEAD>Study Says Papilloma Viruses Double Risk of Cervical Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of more than 2,200 Latin American women
concludes that infection with two varieties of the common papilloma
virus doubles the usual risk of cervical cancer.
   The study is the first major population study to estimate the
increased risk of cancer in women infected with this common virus.
Doctors have known for several years that papilloma viruses are
associated with cancer of the cervix.
   At least 60 different varieties of the papilloma virus have been
identified. Some cause common warts, while others cause genital
warts. The kinds associated with cervical cancer in this study _
types 16 and 18 _ are not thought to cause warts but can be spread
through sexual intercourse and perhaps other means.
   The study was conducted in Panama, Costa Rica, Columbia and
Mexico. Cervical cancer is far more common in these countries than
in the United States, where the disease strikes about 13,000 women
annually.
   It found that genes from the two types of papilloma virus had
become incorporated into the tissue of 62 percent of the women with
cervical cancer, compared with 32 percent of a healthy comparison
group.
   The researchers calculated that the presence of these virus
genes was associated with double the usual risk of cancer.
   ``Our study shows a strong association but not as strong as we
would have originally hypothesized,'' said Dr. Louise A. Brinton of
the National Cancer Institute. ``The high rate of detection in
normal women was an unexpected finding.''
   The study, conducted on 759 women with invasive cervical cancer
and 1,467 randomly chosen healthy women, was directed by Dr.
William C. Reeves of Gorgas Memorial Laboratory in Panama. It was
published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Dr. Stephen Curry of New England Medical Center in Boston noted
that five other types of papilloma virus _ 31, 33, 35, 42 and 56 _
also are associated with cervical cancer. Evidence of one of the
seven types is found in almost all cervical tumors.
   ``The problem is that 40 to 65 percent of women in this country
have other papilloma viruses present that are not precancerous but
are causing a great deal of concern,'' Curry said. ``They don't do
anything but cause warts.''
   Contrary to common belief, the types of papilloma viruses that
cause genital and common warts are not linked with cancer.
   Experts note that in the United States, cervical cancer is
becoming less common, largely because of the wide availability of
Pap test, which can detect precancerous abnormalities.
   Curry said that papilloma viruses probably do not cause cancer
alone but contribute to the disease in combination with some other
factor, such as cigarette smoking or sperm proteins.

<HEAD>Old Master Sold for $35 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Getty Museum paid a record $35.2 million for
a 16th-century Florentine portrait of Duke Cosimo de'Medici that
had been displayed in the Frick Collection since 1970.
   The price paid Wednesday was a record for an Old Master, and was
the fifth highest price paid for a painting at the world's two
major auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's.
   Scholars described the work, sometimes called the Halberdier, as
the finest Italian Renaissance painting to be offered at auction in
more than a decade.
   Christie's said many consider it to be the finest Old Master
painting in private hands in the United States.
   The previous auction record for an Old Master painting was $10.4
million, paid for Andrea Mantegna's ``Adoration of the Magi'' in
London in 1985.
   The presale estimate for the Medici portrait was $20 million.
The price included a 10 percent buyer's premium.
   The painting, circa 1537, is by Jacopo da Carucci, who was known
as Pontormo. Chauncey Devereaux Stillman, a New York investor and
philanthropist who died Jan. 24, had lent it to the Frick in 1970
for its 50th anniversary exhibition.
   Stillman's lawyers said it would be sold for the benefit of the
Homeland Foundation, his charitable organization.
   Charles A. Ryskamp, president of the Frick, said in March that
he was devastated by the painting's removal and expressed concern
that it might leave the country.
   Paintings that have sold for more are: ``Irises'' by Vincent van
Gogh, $53.9 million; ``Yo Picasso'' by Pablo Picasso, $47.85
million; ``Sunflowers'' by van Gogh, $39.9 million, and ``Acrobat
and Young Harlequin'' by Picasso, $38.46 million.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terry Drinkwater, a CBS News correspondent
who covered Patricia Hearst's kidnapping, Mount St. Helens'
eruption and his own battle with cancer, died of the disease. He
was 53.
   Drinkwater died Wednesday at his home in Malibu.
   ``Terry Drinkwater was one of the people who helped invent
television news reporting _ helped make it what it is,'' anchorman
Dan Rather said in a tribute broadcast at the end of the ``CBS
Evening News'' on Wednesday. ``It won't be the same without him.''
   Drinkwater was treated for a larynx tumor in 1983, which was
included as a segment in an award-winning series he prepared on
cancer treatment. He filed his last report for CBS in August 1988.
   ``His reports about his own illness were devoid of self-pity,
and characteristically written with elegance and flair,'' said
Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast group. ``His death
deprives CBS of one of its most valued craftsmen.''
   As a senior correspondent based in Los Angeles, Drinkwater
covered airline disasters, politics, space exploration, and
specialized in reporting on energy and environmental issues.
   The tall, touseled correspondent often reported from the
wilderness. He was frequently in Alaska, covering the 1967 flood in
Fairbanks, the opening of the trans-Alaska pipeline in 1977 and on
wilderness and development issues.
   Drinkwater's series on cancer was awarded an Alfred I.
Dupont-Columbia University Award, one of the most prestigious in
broadcast journalism. He also received three Emmy Awards and a
George Foster Peabody Award.
   Drinkwater founded two radio stations, KPFK-FM in Los Angeles
and WBAI-FM in New York.
   He also covered many political campaigns, traveling with the
press corps during the presidential campaigns of Californians
Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, as well as Robert Kennedy and
Barry Goldwater.
   His primary assignment, however, was as a regional correspondent
whose beat allowed him to roam the West, from the Rocky Mountains
to Alaska's Prudhoe Bay.
   He covered nuclear testing in Nevada, the Hearst kidnapping, the
Watts riots, the eruption of Mount St. Helens and the Pacific
Southwest Airlines and Aeromexico airline disasters in California.
   Drinkwater joined CBS in 1963 after working as a reporter at
television station KTLA in Los Angeles.
   A native of Denver, he was graduated from Pomona College in
Claremont in 1958. He earned a Master of Arts from the University
of California, Berkeley in 1959.
   He is survived by a son, Croft; a daughter, Angela; both of Los
Angeles; a sister, Dorsey Stevenson of Santa Monica, and his
mother, Helen Drinkwater of Los Angeles. No services were planned.

   Billy Howard says he expected to find anger and
bitterness among AIDS sufferers when he began a book of photographs
and thoughts of people with the deadly disease. But it wasn't there.
   Howard, director of photography at Emory University, traveled
the nation taking pictures for 18 months for his book, ``Epitaphs
for the Living: Words and Images In The Time Of AIDS.''
   The book, which is being published soon, has 68 photographs and
handwritten comments by the AIDS sufferers.
   ``What surprised me the most was the spiritual nature of a lot
of (the comments),'' he said Wednesday in a telephone interview
from New York, where he was to appear today for a taping on ``CBS
This Morning.'' The interview will be broadcast at a later date.
   ``I was surprised how few had a bitter tinge to them at all, how
many said they had discovered so much about themselves while
dealing with the disease,'' he said.
   ``They were really more concerned about reaching out to other
people than in eliciting sympathy for what they are going through.''
   He said word of the project spread, usually by word of mouth,
through the AIDS community, and he let people decide to participate
before he contacted them.
   About half of his subjects are from the Atlanta area. Others are
from Washington, D.C., New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
   Southern Methodist University is publishing the book, which
should be on sale in mid-June. A display of some of the photos
opens June 5 at the International Center of Photography in New York.
   Howard said he got the idea for the book while doing photo
assignments for Emory.
   ``I was looking for a project that was meaningful to me,'' he
said. ``My dentist had died of AIDS the year before and I was never
able to do anything for him. This seemed like a positive thing I
could do.''
   He said the subjects he photographed had the option of backing
out of the project up until the time of publication, but only a
couple did so.
   ``People who wanted to participate saw it as a venue to make a
statement to other people,'' Howard said.

   Owen Lattimore, a China scholar who Sen.
Joseph McCarthy once accused of being ``the top Soviet espionage
agent in the United States,'' has died. He was 88.
   Lattimore, who suffered a stroke last year and who had been in
failing health the past two weeks, died Wednesday, relatives said.
   McCarthy made his much-quoted accusation against Lattimore in
March 1950, lated toning it down to ``one of the top'' agents.
However, a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee concluded there
was no basis for McCarthy's accusation and exonerated Lattimore in
July 1950.
   In 1952, a federal grand jury indicted Lattimore on seven counts
of perjury in connection with his 1951 testimony before the Senate
Internal Security Subcommittee, which was investigating the
Institute on Pacific Relations, an international organization of
countries concerned with the Pacific region.
   The Justice Department dropped all charges against Lattimore in
1955.
   Lattimore edited the institute's Pacific Affairs journal from
1934 to 1941. The Justice Department dropped all charges against
him in 1955.
   Lattimore, who grew up in China, and spent nearly 25 years in
the Far East, did not earn a university degree, instead going into
business and doing newspaper work in Shanghai and Beijing from 1920
to 1926.
   He studied at Harvard University in 1929 before beginning
research in Manchuria in 1929 and 1930. He conducted more research
in Beijing from 1930 to 1935, also working in Mongolia.
   From 1941 to 1942 he served as a politicial adviser to Chaing
Kai-shek, the leader of the Nationalist government. He then became
deputy director of Pacific operations for the U.S. Office of War
Information, serving until 1944.
   He was the director of the Walter Hines Page School of
International Relations at Johns Hopkins University from 1939 to
1953. He lectured at Hopkins from 1938 to 1963.
   Among Lattimore's books are: ``High Tartary'' (1930),
``Manchuria, Cradle of Conflict'' (1932), ``Inner Asian Frontiers
of China'' (1940), and ``Ordeal By Slander'' (1950).
   He is survived by a son, David Lattimore of Pawtucket, a
professor in the department of East Asian studies at Brown
University, a sister, six grandchildren and two great-grandsons.
His wife, Eleanor, died in the mid-1960s.
   A family member said Lattimore's remains will be cremated and
that a memorial service will be held at a later date.

<HEAD>Infants Can Receive Parents' Kidneys, Doctor Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Countless infants are dying of kidney failure
because their families and physicians don't realize the babies
could be saved by transplanting a parent's organ into them, a
doctor says.
   ``We don't want to coerce any parents to donate. But it is a
proven treatment,'' said Dr. Samuel K.S. So of the University of
Minnesota Hospital.
   ``The major thrust is to let pediatricians and primary care
physicians know there are options. There's hope for these
children,'' he said Wednesday at the annual meeting of the American
Society of Transplant Physicians.
   An estimated 900 children are born every year in the United
States with kidney failure. show. Two-thirds usually die before
being referred for treatment.
   So and colleagues at the hospital have saved 15 such infants
since 1978 through transplantation. Three have died.
   Of the survivors, 13 are doing fine with the original graft. Two
underwent a second transplant.
   Most of the recipients achieved normal growth, a problem for
young dialysis and transplant patients, So said.
   ``What gives us lots of satisfaction and joy is seeing these
kids running around and playing just like normal kids,'' he said.
   Dr. Gerald Arbus, associate professor of pediatrics at the
University of Toronto, recommends kidney transplants be performed
on children under age 3 only if the organs come from living
relatives.
   Too many lives are being lost and money wasted putting dead
people's kidneys into toddlers, he said. The results are just as
discouraging when transplants are performed with kidneys from
brain-dead children under age 4, he said.
   ``It may be a combination of small grafts into pediatric
patients that produces this problem,'' said Dr. Steven Alexander of
Children's Medical Center in Dallas.
   Kidneys that come from living relatives inevitably work better
than those from dead strangers, said Dr. Amir Tejani, of the State
University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn.
   Living-related donors accounted for nearly half the 675 kidney
transplants reported to the North American Pediatric Renal
Transplant Cooperative Study from its inception in January 1987
through October 1988, Tejani said. The cooperative represents 70
centers in North America.
   ``They do very well,'' Tejani said. ``On the other hand, there
are some concerns that suggest putting small organs from cadavers
into another child may not be very good for the small children.''
   Arbus said only a third of 22 patients under age 3 who received
a kidney from a brain-dead donor at The Hospital for Sick Children
in Toronto had a functioning organ one year after surgery. The
donor's age was irrelevant.
   Half the 18 children ages 3 to 9 who received a kidney from a
brain-dead donor under age 4 enjoyed a one-year success rate, Arbus
said. That jumped to 69 percent of the 13 cases in which the kidney
came from a donor ages 4 to 9 and 77 percent of the 39 cases
involving donors over age 9.
   The results were similar for the 136 recipients over age 9, said
Arbus.
   Arbus said the problem with tiny kidneys, about the size of the
donor's fist, is that they are difficult to store safely while a
recipient is being sought. Blood clots also tend to form in them,
and they warm up too quickly when inserted.
   Older cadavers' organs do poorly in younger patients because the
childrens' hearts often are too little to handle big kidneys.
Younger recipients also show poor tolerance to slightly damaged
organs.
   Such factors do not seem to affect the outcome of heart and
liver transplantation among toddlers, doctors said.
   With kidney transplants costing $25,000 to $30,000 each, the
expense of unsuccessful operations can mount quickly, Arbus said.
Dialysis and kidney transplantation are covered by the U.S. and
Canadian government health plans.
   ``In going for a transplant and losing it right away, you're
just back on dialysis'' provided the patient survives, Arbus said.
   Patients' chances for success worsen with each subsequent
transplant.
   ``You want to give them their best chance with the first,''
Arbus said.

   Kimberly-Clark swiped at least $300
million in sales from Procter &amp; Gamble by copying its design for
super-absorbent disposable diapers, a lawyer claimed.
   Attorney Allen Gerstein gave the estimate in closing arguments
in Procter &amp; Gamble's federal lawsuit against its biggest
competitor.
   The company claims the design of its super-absorbent Pampers was
copied by Kimberly-Clark in developing its super-absorbent Huggies.
Procter &amp; Gamble wants the judge to order a halt to Huggies
producton and have them removed from stores.
   But a lawyer for Kimberly-Clark said the company had no desire
to copy Pampers because early versions of that product leaked.
   ``Kimberly-Clark totally, independently developed its Huggies
super-trim diapers,'' said the attorney, V. Bryan Medlock Jr.
   Barring an out-of-court settlement, U.S. District Judge Falcon
Hawkins is expected to rule this summer in the non-jury case.
   Procter &amp; Gamble forecast sales of $300 million a year from
super-absorbent Pampers, Gerstein said. But sales were $150 million
below projections in both fiscal 1986-87 and the following year
after Kimberly-Clark introduced its super-absorbent Huggies, he
said.
   Industry experts say about $3.3 billion worth of disposable
diapers are produced each year. Procter &amp; Gamble is the industry
leader with about 47 percent of the market and Kimberly-Clark is
No. 2 with about 30 percent.
   The complaint does not seek specific monetary damages. If
Kimberly-Clark is found liable, damages would be determined in a
second proceeding.
   The closing arguments ended 17 days of testimony in the trial.
   The complaint by Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble says
researchers Paul Weisman and Steve Goldman developed a new way for
combining wood pulp fluff and super-absorbent materials to allow
disposable diapers to be made thinner.
   Kimberly-Clark violated the patented process in making its
super-absorbent Huggies, the complaint says.
   But Kimberly-Clark contends Procter &amp; Gamble never had a valid
patent because it provided misleading information to the U.S Patent
Office.
   The examining officer never would have issued a patent to
Procter &amp; Gamble if he had known about earlier work by an Italian
inventor, Medlock said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said it test-marketed its new super-absorbent
Pampers in Wichita, Kan., in 1984 and then Kimberly-Clark copied
the design.
   Medlock also argued that Procter &amp; Gamble had not proven a link
between the invention and the success of the new products.
   ``There is no way to tell whether the success of these other
products is due to the Weisman-Goldman invention or other
inventions,'' Medlock added.
   But Gerstein said the Weisman-Goldman development ran contrary
to the thinking at the time that fluff and super-absorbent material
could not be combined in a diaper.
   ``Not one person, not one article, not one patent'' had shown
that it could be done, he said.

<HEAD>Prices Plunge On Tokyo Market, Dollar Off Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices plunged today on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
while the U.S. dollar declined against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
189.86 points Wednesday, dropped 285.40 points, or 0.83 percent,
finishing the day at 33,981.35.
   The dollar closed at 142.52 yen, its lowest level of the day and
0.18 yen below its finish on Wednesday. The U.S. currency opened
higher at 143.20 yen and ranged up to 143.25 yen.
   Minori Takeuchi with Chemical Bank in Tokyo said trading was
``quite rough'' with wide fluctuations.
   ``The dollar started higher in Tokyo, but gradually fell as
investors sold it to buy Swiss francs,'' she said.
   The Swiss National Bank announced it will begin to use a
floating interest rate system, which market analysts saw as good
news for the Swiss franc.
   Ms. Takeuchi said the Bank of Japan intervened in the market to
slow the U.S. currency's rise early in the morning when the dollar
opened higher.
   Many Japanese investors also were cautious because of
speculation that West Germany may raise its discount rate, traders
said.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei index plunged in the afternoon
as concern spread over the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's
continuing problems in choosing a successor to Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita, dealers said.
   A group of young Liberal Democrats said today they would back
their own candidate for prime minister, despite the selection of
Former Minister Sousuke Uno by party leaders.
   A dealer with a major securities firm said speculation over a
possible additional hike in Japan's official discount rate also
discouraged market participants.
   Market analysts said the central bank might have to consider
another hike in the rate if the dollar keeps rising against the yen.
   On Wednesday the central bank raised its discount rate 0.75
percentage points to 3.25 percent.
   Trading was hectic with massive selling orders. Volume on the
market's first section was estimated at 1.6 billion shares, up from
Wednesday's 1 billion shares.

<HEAD>U.S.-Soviet Scientists Study Whether Earth Can Fight Greenhouse Effect</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Researchers, including two Soviet
scientists, intend to sample the sea and air off Washington's
northern coast, seeking evidence that the Earth may have natural
defenses against the greenhouse effect.
   The 38-member Pacific Stratus Investigation, scheduled to begin
today, will combine three aircraft, a sea-going research vessel,
shore-based observations and satellite data to determine if the
global warming effect caused by carbon dioxide and other gases has
an effect on cloud formation.
   The eight U.S. and two Soviet organizations involved want to see
if the Earth's higher temperature leads to greater release by sea
plankton of sulfur gases that rise to form the nuclei of clouds.
   The scientists hope to gather enough data during the next 10
days to allow them to simulate cloud formation in scientific models
used to recreate the greenhouse effect. Cloud formation is a key
parameter absent in current models.
   The initial results will be discussed next fall among the
researchers, and a second sampling effort is scheduled for April
1990.
   ``It is possible (the Earth) has a natural thermostat built in
that would reduce the temperature naturally,'' project member Peter
Hobbs, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of
Washington, told reporters Wednesday.
   ``If the Earth's temperature warms, plankton activity might
increase, which would mean more droplets in clouds that would
reflect the sun's radiation more, and recool (the Earth),'' he said.
   Those involved say the research effort will be the first to test
an idea advanced by different scientists but credited mainly to
British scientist James Lovelock.
   The hypothesis holds that Earth warming could increase the
activity of phytoplankton, which release sulfur gases that rise and
condense to form particles called cloud condensation nuclei, the
seeds of clouds.
   More gases could mean more clouds, and this could mean more
natural blocking of the sun and a cooling effect that could
compensate for the warming caused by heat retained by excessive
carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere.
   Initial data show the opposite may be true: that the higher
temperature could be slowing phytoplankton activity, speeding up
the greenhouse effect.
   University of Washington atmospheric chemist Robert Charlson,
performing tests in France, found that more sulfur was present
during the last ice age than during warmer times, indicating that
the phytoplankton may have accentuated the temperature changes
rather than counterbalancing them.
   ``We don't know if a change in the activity of the phytoplankton
will change the radiative properties of clouds,'' Hobbs said.
   The Soviets are experts on particle distributions in air and
dimethylsulfide, the gas emitted by the phytoplankton that rises to
form cloud condensation nuclei.
   The immediate aim of the effort is to measure the concentration
of plankton-emitted gases in the ocean's surface waters and at
various altitudes above it.
   This data would then allow scientists to factor cloud formation
data into global climate models.

<HEAD>Cardinal Returns From Trip To Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal John O'Connor said he canceled a visit
to meet Moslem leaders in west Beirut because of a warning that he
might be kidnapped and taken hostage.
   At a news conference at Kennedy International Airport upon his
return to the United States on Wednesday, the cardinal called his
three-day visit to Lebanon a success because it focused attention
on the fighting there.
   He called for a Vatican-sponsored peace conference, supported by
the United States and other major powers, to end the fighting and
said Pope John Paul II had agreed to support the idea.
   O'Connor said he began receiving messages Saturday that ``some
very special circumstances'' had developed, making it clear it
would have been too dangerous for him to travel to west Beirut.
   ``I was finally convinced at that point that it would not be
worth the risk, especially of being taken hostage,'' he said.
   O'Connor said stories in Lebanese newspapers that Moslem leaders
were angered by his decision to cancel the visit were inaccurate.
   The cardinal said Selim Hoss, prime minister of the Moslem
government of Lebanon, had agreed he made the right decision. The
Moslem government is being challenged by a Christian cabinet.
   O'Connor said he hoped the Bush administration would support a
Vatican-sponsored peace conference, and said Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir and Hoss had reacted favorably to the idea.
   O'Connor said his unsuccessful attempt to find out where the
Western hostages are being held was one failure of the trip. He
said people who had provided information in the past could tell him
nothing about the hostages.
   ``They said it's as if they have vanished into thin air,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Beijing Issues New Press Restrictions On Protest Coverage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City leaders today expanded martial law
restrictions on reporting by foreign correspondents, saying they
may not cover student protesters and that news coverage in Beijing
must receive prior approval.
   In a stern warning, city spokesman Ding Weijun also said foreign
reporters may not invite Chinese citizens to their offices,
residences or hotels ``for interviews on activities prohibited''
under martial law.
   Ding's statement, read at a weekly Foreign Ministry briefing,
elaborated on martial law regulations banning foreign news coverage
of the student-led pro-democracy movement.
   The foreign correspondents' club denounced the expanded rules as
``censorship and harassment.''
   Premier Li Peng declared martial law in Beijing on May 20 in an
attempt to crush the pro-democracy movement, which began in
mid-April with student marches and class boycotts and has
galvanized the nation.
   Defying martial law, Beijing have prevented troops from entering
the city and nearly 10,000 students continue their occupation of
Tiananmen Square, the symbolic center of power.
   Martial law restrictions barring foreign reporters from
interviewing demonstrators have been widely ignored.
   Ding said, ``Press coverage in Beijing by foreign journalists or
journalists from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan is subjected to prior
application'' for approval by the city foreign affairs office.
   The broad statement indicated that all news coverage, not only
that relating to the demonstrations, must be approved first.
   Coverage of martial law troops, including taking photos and
videotapes, is banned, and reporting ``in a disguised form'' such
as meeting Chinese participating in the democratic movement in
hotels, offices or residences is outlawed.
   Journalists were also told they should not ``acquire by unjust
means'' materials ``of an instigative or agitative nature.''
   Ding said the Beijing government reserves the right to interpret
the decrees as it sees fit and that the decrees take precedence
over other existing regulations.
   The Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing in a statement said
it ``strongly protests'' the martial law restrictions on
journalists, calling them ``a deplorable case of press censorship
and harassment.''
   The statement said the ban on coverage ``calls into question
China's policy of openness to the outside world'' and urged Beijing
authorities to rescind the regulations.
   Beijing-based foreign journalists and hundreds of journalists
from outside China covering the popular uprising so far have faced
only isolated obstacles.
   Foreign TV crews have had to deal with periods of not being
allowed to transmit by satellite, and some Chinese-language
frequencies of the U.S.-government-financed Voice of America have
been jammed.
   There has been no official attempt to keep journalists off
Tiananmen Square or away from student activists.
   However, in the past several days at least two U.S. television
network representatives and a Japanese network were warned by
police that their crews were violating martial law regulations and
told they were to cease all unauthorized reporting.
   A correspondent for the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun was also
summoned for a warning and today, the British Broadcasting Corp.
was also called in by police.
   In no case have specific threats been made. Ding also said
nothing specific about penalties, only that violations will be
dealt with ``in light of the seriousness of the individual case.''
   At dawn today, about 300 People's Liberation Army troops marched
down Beijing's main avenue near Tiananmen Square, chanting a
military song.
   It was the second straight day that the military had appeared in
force on city streets _ on Wednesday a large convoy of military
motorcycles with sidecars roared through the capital.
   ``I think they were just sent to try and scare us,'' said Wang
Di, a sophomore from the Beijing Journalism Institute. ``But I
don't think anyone was scared. They didn't come that close and not
many students knew they were there.''
   Students have refused to leave the square until the government
answers their demands for reforms including a free press and an end
to official corruption.
   Government hardliners, including Premier Li and senior leader
Deng Xiaoping, have demanded the democracy movement be suppressed.
   They reportedly ousted from power Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang, considered a student sympathizer.
   On Wednesday night, students put up tents around their 33-foot
``Goddess of Democracy'' to prevent any government attempt to
remove it.
   The government says the statue, a replica of the Statue of
Liberty, insults the Chinese people and demanded it be removed by
today. The plastic foam statue of a robed woman holding aloft a
torch was unveiled by students Tuesday.
   The statue faces the gate to the Forbidden City and
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung's portrait.
   ``Thursday came and it's still here,'' said a student from Wuhan
Maritime Industrial Institute. ``Our revolution will endure.''

<HEAD>Fugitive From ``French Connection'' Case Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fugitive sought for 17 years on charges of
supervising heroin distribution as part of the notorious French
Connection drug network was arrested at a hospital here.
   Stanton Garland, 60, was arrested Wednesday by federal marshals
at the Meadowbrook Neurological Center in Los Angeles, where he was
visiting his son, Deputy Marshal Ernest Santoscoy said.
   Federal authorities have been searching for Garland since he
disappeared in New York on Sept. 26, 1972, while facing a possible
20-year sentence for heroin distribution. At the time, Garland was
testifying against other members of a ring that allegedly imported
heroin from Marseilles, France.
   The case, which broke in 1962 with the confiscation of 120
pounds of almost pure heroin, became the basis of the 1971 Academy
Award-winning film, ``The French Connection.''
   ``Our understanding is he was the major ... distributor for
Harlem,'' said David O'Flaherty, the deputy U.S. marshal in
Brooklyn who supervised the manhunt.
   Garland went to the hospital to pick up his son, Lonnie, who was
seriously injured in an automobile accident in February and was to
be released Wednesday, the day his health insurance expired,
Santoscoy said.
   Marshals staked out the hospital after the monitoring of
telephone calls to Garland's family found people were being
directed to the hospital. Los Angeles-based deputies then
determined that patient Lonnie Garland was the fugitive's son,
Santoscoy said.
   Marshals arrested Garland outside the hospital after an
administrator took him outside on the pretext of discussing his
son's records privately.
   ``We just walked up very quietly to him, and we just basically
said, `Mr. Garland, you're under arrest,'' said marshal Robert
Grossman, who made the arrest with Santoscoy.
   ``He stopped talking. Basically, he knew the jig had been had,
and that was it.''
   Garland was being held on a charge of escape from the Eastern
District in Brooklyn.
   U.S. Magistrate Robert Stone tentatively scheduled a June 9
hearing on a request for Garland's extradition to New York,
Santoscoy said.

   A mild earthquake jolted Southern
California residents awake early today but caused no damage or
injuries, authorities said.
   ``It was a loud bang, there was a little bit of shaking, and
that's it,'' Redlands police dispatcher Marv Klein said.
   The quake, measuring 3.5 on the Richter scale, struck at 2:33
a.m., 3 miles south of Redlands, said Robert Finn, spokesman for
the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   The temblor was felt in several cities in San Bernardino and
Riverside counties. Redlands is about 65 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles.
   ``It was a sharp jolt,'' said Jan Wier, a dispatcher at the
California Department of Forestry in Perris, 20 miles south of
Redlands. ``We felt the building move, and that's it.''
   A San Bernardino County sheriff's dispatcher in Rialto said she
didn't feel anything there, but was getting calls from Yucaipa and
Loma Linda.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight

   The dollar had a mixed performance against other
major currencies today in slow early trading in Europe. Gold prices
fell.
   In Frankfurt, dealers said the market opinion was divided over
whether West Germany's central bank will alter its interest rates.
There was speculation the bank might float the West German Lombard
rate, now 6.5 percent, which would depress the dollar.
   ``People are preparing for the possibility that they might do
something with the Lombard rate,'' said Manfred Totzauer, a trader
at Citibank in Frankfurt. ``They could introduce something like the
special (floating) Lombard. But it's still all speculation.''
   On Wednesday the dollar fell in New York on speculation that the
U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and possibly other central banks were
selling dollars to rein in the American currency. A high dollar
makes U.S. exports more expensive.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar slid against the yen to close at 142.52 yen,
down 0.18 yen from Wednesday. Later, in London, the dollar
continued to fall and was quoted at 142.43 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.9801 West German marks, up from 1.9755
   _1.7102 Swiss francs, up from 1.7055
   _6.7185 French francs, up from 6.6855
   _2.2286 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2460
   _1,434.75 Italian lire, down from 1,443.00
   _1.2065 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2061.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5746 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5682 late
Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $361.90 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $363.50. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $360.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $360.35 compared with $363.43 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.71 an ounce to close at a

   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.16 a troy
ounce, down from Wednesday's $5.20.

<HEAD>Arafat Orders Creation of 3,500-Strong Palestine Army: Jane's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser
Arafat has ordered the establishment of a 3,500-member Palestinian
army in south Lebanon, Jane's Defense Weekly reported today.
   The force is to become ``the core of a regular army of an
independent Palestine of the future,'' the London-based military
affairs magazine said.
   It is intended to replace ``the existing chaos of assorted
unruly militias, most of them affiliated with Arab countries and
not always friendly to Arafat,'' Jane's said.
   The magazine said Arafat sent his handpicked military commanders
to south Lebanon in February to serve notice that part-time militia
salaries were to be reduced, and eventually stopped.
   ``Fighters and militiamen of all factions could volunteer for
the Palestine army, with the understanding that applications would
be subject to Arafat's personal approval,'' Jane's said.
   It said the affected militiamen protested strongly and at times
violently because the economic crisis in Lebanon provides no other
outside employment. It said the militia system provides a
livelihood for about 10,000 men in south Lebanon refugee camps
alone.
   Jane's said that because of the protests, Arafat told his staff
in the Fatah militia to postpone the salary cuts for the time being.
   ``Top Fatah officers, graduates of Indian, Pakistani and East
bloc military academies and those who have served with the
Jordanian army, are now in Lebanon running training courses in the
vicinity of Miyeh Miyeh village, east of the South Lebanese port of
Sidon,'' it reported.
   It said that on May 19, about 200 Palestinians completed basic
training at the Rashediyeh refugee camp, south of Tyre.
   Jane's said that as Arafat's ``well-equipped and well-financed
army'' takes shape, officers serving with other Palestinian
factions have been enlisting, including Naif Hawatme's Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine and George Habash's Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).
   ``Although leaders of both these factions have been recently
critical of Arafat's moves, a PFLP official said they have no
objection to their officers joining the Palestinian Army and their
departure will not affect their guerrilla operations,'' Jane's said.
   It said Arafat currently controls about 2,000 full-time trained
fighters and about 7,500 part-time militiamen in south Lebanon.
   ``About 1,000 more fighters and 2,500 militiamen are controlled
by other factions, including virulently anti-Arafat PFLP-General
Command of Ahmed Jibril and Abu Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary
Council,'' it said.
   Jane's said all the factions have been acquiring arms, but
Arafat's Fatah is far ahead.
   ``Weapons hidden in caches during Israel's 1982-85 Lebanon
invasion and occupation have been issued to the militiamen and
refugee camp guards or made available to potential Lebanese
allies,'' it said.
   ``Fatah regulars, now constituting the bulk of the Palestine
army, have been re-equipped with brand new Kalashnikov rifles,
Energa anti-armor and antipersonnel rifle grenades, and RPG-7s
(rocket-propelled grenade) as personal weapons,'' it said.
   ``ZSU 23-4 anti-aircraft guns, 81 and 120mm mortars, 106mm
recoilless rifles, 107mm multiple rocket launchers and SAM-7
Strella heat-seeking surface-to-air missiles are the heavy
weapons.''

<HEAD>French, British Forces Could Complicate Bush Proposals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has
called President Bush's disarmament proposals basically positive,
but says he doubts an agreement can be reached within a year on
reducing troop levels in Europe.
   Bush has called for accord on the reductions within 12 months.
   Speaking to reporters at the airport before leaving for Moscow
on Wednesday, Shevardnadze said the presence of British and French
units in Europe could complicate the Bush proposals, the
conservative French newspaper Le Figaro reported today.
   ``I want to emphasize that the British and French forces in West
Germany represent 100,000 men and this creates an imbalance,'' he
said.
   Shevardnadze also said he was ``disappointed'' by the NATO's
declaration at its Brussels summit this week that it favors
delaying talks on reducing short-range nuclear missile arsenals in
Europe until a conventional arms accord is completed and put into
effect.
   During the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting, Bush
proposed a cut in U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe to 275,000 each.
This would mean a 10 percent reduction for the United States but a
reduction of more than half for the Soviets.
   Shevardnadze was in Paris to attend a human rights conference
and before leaving met with Foreign Minister Roland Dumas to
discuss the scheduled July 4-7 visit of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to France.

<HEAD>Flooding Washes Out Roads In Michigan; Heavy Rain In Chicago</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain drenched Chicago and parts of the Midwest early
today, causing floods that washed away roads in Michigan.
   Roads were swept away in Eaton and Clinton counties in southern
Michigan, and considerable street flooding was reported in Lansing.
   Lightning struck about 200 times late Wednesday in the southern
third of lower Michigan, said David Koehler, a National Weather
Service meteorologist in Ann Arbor.
   Arthur Wozniak, 33, of Waterford Township, died after being
struck by lightning, apparently while fishing in a metal boat on
Elizabeth Lake, authorities said.
   Nearly 4 inches of rain fell in two hours early today in St.
John, Ind., making some roads in the area impassable and knocking
out power.
   Thunderstorms also dumped more than 2 inches of rain in the
Chicago area.
   Flood watches were in effect for all of today in parts of
northern Ohio.
   In the Cleveland suburb of Eastlake, a dike on the Chagrin River
gave way Wednesday, flooding a neighborhood and forcing about 50
residents from their homes. Residents were still cleaning up from
flooding a week ago.
   A storm knocked down trees and blew off an apartment building
roof in Quincy, Mich., while winds also blew down large trees in
Burlington, Mich.
   Hail up to 1 inch in diameter fell in Montgomery, Mich., and
thunderstorm winds gusted to 60 mph in Princeville, Ill., about 15
miles northwest of Peoria.
   Thunderstorms were scattered from southern Iowa across western
Missouri, much of Kansas and Oklahoma to western Texas.
   In the Texas panhandle, golfball-size hail fell in Castro County
late Wednesday, and nickel-size hail was reported in northwest
Oklahoma.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included more than an inch in Allentown, Pa., an inch in Wichita,
Kan., and three-quarters of an inch in Enid, Okla., and in Detroit.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
northern New England across New York, Pennsylvania, southern
Michigan, portions of the Ohio and middle Mississippi valleys and
eastern portions of the central Plains to northern and central
Texas; severe thunderstorms possible over eastern Missouri, much of
Illinois and Indiana and western Ohio; and widely scattered
thunderstorms over the central Gulf Coast and eastern portions of
the Rocky Mountain states.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s over Nebraska, western
Kansas, eastern Colorado, much of Wyoming, portions of Michigan and
Wisconsin; and in the 90s from the middle and south Atlantic
coastal states across the Tennessee Valley, Gulf Coast, most of
Texas and the Desert Southwest to interior valleys of California.
Elsewhere, highs were mostly expected to be in the 70s and 80s.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 31 degrees in Yellowstone
National Park, Wyo., to 82 degrees at Key West Naval Air Station,
Fla., and Keesler Air Force Base at Biloxi, Miss.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II today began a visit to
Scandinavia, a Lutheran stronghold with fewer Roman Catholics than
normally turn out to hear him on holidays in St. Peter's Square.
   The pope emerged from his special Alitalia jetliner and knelt to
kiss the ground, his custom in his 41 previous foreign tours
whenever reaching a country he has never visited before.
   Besides the stop in Norway, the pope's 10-day tour also will
take him to Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Sweden.
   The pontiff was welcomed by Norway's Lutheran bishops, officials
of the tiny Catholic church in Norway and by Prime Minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland.
   The pope said he came to Scandinavia ``as a brother deeply
concerned with the well-being of his brothers and sisters in every
part of the world. I come to Norway as a friend full of esteem and
love for its noble people and its millenary Christian heritage.''
   In a brief welcome speech on the tarmac, Mrs. Brundtland praised
the pontiff for his ``important role as a mediator and arbitrator
in international affairs.''
   She said the pope's efforts to increase dialogue were crucial
for ``promoting mutual understanding between people from different
cultures.''
   On his flight from Rome, the pope was asked by Norwegian
reporters about reports that some Lutheran bishops were unhappy
about the visit.
   He said, ``The church and I personally are undertaking an
ecumenical meeting. Certainly, not all the Lutheran bishops share
this ecumenical path, as, sometimes, some Catholics also have
trouble with it.''
   One Norwegian Lutheran bishop is refusing to attend a joint
prayer service in Trondheim on Friday.
   John Paul, who is known as an avid sportsman, also was asked if
he had brought his skis to Norway, and he responded, tying the
issue to his mission:
   ``I've been told that the best solution for ecumenism and for
the rapproachment of the churches would be if the pope, the king of
Sweden or the king of Norway, could go skiing together.''
   John Paul will give more than 30 speeches as he travels across
the land of the midnight sun and north of the Arctic Circle,
preaching to a flock that by Vatican count numbers 197,000, or less
than 1 percent of the population.
   ``But he will always have a wider _ that is Lutheran _ audience
in mind,'' said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   The schedule for the start of the trip includes meetings with
King Olav V and Mrs. Brundtland, and the first of a series of
ecumenical encounters.
   Never before in his 10{-year papacy has John Paul visited a
Christian region with so few Catholics, evidence of his intent to
bring Rome's message to every country of the world.
   Scandinavia is an area where the 16th-century Protestant
Reformation swept away Roman Catholicism, where the Lutheran Church
is associated with the state and Catholicism was outlawed until a
century ago.
   In Copenhagen, John Paul will attend a prayer service but not
speak at the request of the Lutheran church. He is also expected to
refrain from a display of the symbols of papal authority, as he did
when he did not wear his miter during a historic visit to a
Lutheran church in Rome in 1983.
   It was the first time the pope had visited the church founded by
theleader of the Reformation, the German monk Martin Luther.
   Luther was excommunicated by Rome in 1521 for attacking
widespread views that salvation could be earned by good works, such
as paying for Masses and indulgences to avert penalities in
purgatory.
   Throughout the trip, John Paul is expected to stress Christian
ethics in the affluent societies where religion appears to play a
very small role, bolster the morale of the Catholics and signal his
interest in moving ahead relations with the Lutherans.
   The highly developed countries are overwhelmingly secular and
attitudes toward marriage, birth control and abortion are in sharp
contrast to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.
   But Scandinavian Catholic leaders take affront at depictions of
Scandinavia as a center of sin, often associated with easy sex and
pornography.
   ``The Osservatore Romano (the Vatican daily newspaper) has
written that we live in a pool of immorality. What nonsense!''
Helsinki Bishop Paul Verschuren told the religious affairs monthly
30 Days.
   Only in the past 100 years has the church emerged from centuries
of of repression. For a brief period in Denmark, being Catholic was
a capital offense. A 1952 Swedish law guaranteed freedom of
religion but it wasn't until 1977 that the final law against
Catholicism was stricken from the books when it became legal to
build a monastery.

<HEAD>Actor Says Slain Producer Feared Trouble From ``The Cotton Club''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slain producer Roy Radin was nervous and
expected trouble about ``The Cotton Club'' movie on the night he
vanished, according to the co-star of the old TV series ``Sanford
and Son.''
   Radin asked Demond Wilson to carry a gun and follow him to a
business dinner on the night of his disappearance, the actor
testified Wedneday.
   ``He said that there might be some trouble. He said that
something might happen to him as a result of his association with
the film thing ... `The Cotton Club,''' Wilson said.
   A month after his disappearance on May 13, 1983, Radin's
decomposing, bullet-riddled corpse was found in a dry riverbed 65
miles north of Los Angeles.
   Wilson testified at a preliminary hearing to determine whether
four people should stand trial for Radin's abduction-slaying.
   Radin, 33, a theatrical producer from New York, was trying to
make his mark in Hollywood. Radin was Wilson's personal manager and
was enmeshed in a deal with producer Robert Evans to finance ``The
Cotton Club.''
   Radin told Wilson to follow him as the producer headed for a
business dinner with ``important people'' at a swanky Beverly Hills
restaurant, Wilson said.
   ``He asked me to follow and just watch and see if anything
happened,'' Wilson said, adding later, ``He said if anything were
to happen he wanted someone there to observe it.''
   Wilson, who acknowledged he had a drug habit then, said he lost
Radin's limousine in traffic on Sunset Boulevard and never saw him
again.
   Under further questioning Wilson said he used cocaine, alcohol
and pills in 1983. Asked by an attorney whether he underwent a drug
rehabilitation program, he said: ``No, sir. I found Christ.''
   Wilson said he last saw Radin with a woman ``in a glitzy dress''
as they stepped into a limousine headed for dinner at La Scala.
   The woman has been identified previously as Karen DeLayne
Greenberger, a reputed drug dealer who is charged with three men in
the Radin murder.
   The prosecution contends Mrs. Greenberger arranged Radin's
murder after they fought about her share of profits from ``The
Cotton Club.''
   Mrs. Greenberger, who introduced Radin and Evans, is charged
with Alex Lamota Marti, William Molony Mentzer and Robert Ulmer
Lowe, former bodyguards for Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt.
Lowe is fighting extradition in Maryland.
   Wilson was visibly nervous during his testimony and told the
judge at one point: ``I'm new at this. Please forgive me.''
   A defense attorney attacked Wilson's testimony, noting the actor
never before told anyone that Radin expressed fear.
   ``He was pretty fearful,'' Wilson insisted. ``There was a lot of
anxiety around him. ... It was not a fear that somebody's hands
were shaking. It's something that a friend knows.''
   Wilson said he was concerned enough to offer to call police, but
Radin declined and asked if he had a gun.
   ``He knew I carried heat and that was that,'' said Wilson.
``When he went out with me he was confident.''
   Wilson's former secretary has given a conflicting version of
these events, saying that Wilson and she saw Radin's limousine make
a right turn followed by a car full of men, but Wilson decided not
to stay with him.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Leaders Urge Debt Payment Squeeze To Force Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
other anti-apartheid church leaders today urged foreign bankers to
refuse to reschedule South Africa's debt payments unless the
government makes major political concessions.
   An interim debt agreement expires on June 30, 1990, and South
Africa's white-controlled government is faced with payments of at
least $8 billion by 1991 unless new terms are established.
   The four clergymen said bankers should negotiate a new agreement
only in exchange for government promises to lift the state of
emergency, free political prisoners, lift bans on opposition
groups, repeal discriminatory laws and begin talks on granting full
political rights to blacks.
   ``Without such linkage, rescheduling will amount to an extension
of time and credit to the apartheid regime to continue brutalizing
the oppressed majority in South Africa,'' said a letter released by
the South African Council of Churches.
   The letter was signed by Tutu, the first black leader of the
Anglican Church in southern Africa; the Rev. Frank Chikane, black
general-secretary of the church council; the Rev. Allan Boesak,
mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches;
and the Rev. Beyers Naude, a veteran white anti-apartheid activist.
   The clergymen also recommended that trade credits to South
Africa be suspended and that banks halt gold loans, in which South
Africa uses its gold reserves as collateral.
   Two weeks ago, the head of the Reserve Bank of South Africa,
Gerhard de Kock, warned that the country's economy faced stagnation
unless there was ``adequate progress in the field of political and
constitutional reform.''
   His cautiously worded speech was viewed as confirmation that a
4-year-old freeze on new loans to South Africa has seriously harmed
the economy. Since 1985, several billion dollars has left South
Africa, without replacement, to pay off old debts and purchase
imports.
   Since de Kock's speech, the economy has been battered even
further by the falling price of gold, by far the country's most
important export.
   The loan freeze has had more impact on South Africa than other
forms of economic sanctions. Most foreign companies which have
withdrawn from South Africa have sold their holdings at favorable
terms to local executives, and exports of coal, steel and farm
produce have been sustained despite embargoes by the U.S. and some
Western European countries.
   Tutu and his colleagues have been criticized harshly by whites
and conservative blacks for their advocacy of sanctions. The
critics claim sanctions will harden white attitudes while causing
harm primarily to poor blacks.
   The four anti-apartheid leaders, on a visit to the United States
earlier this month, launched a new campaign seeking to target
economic pressure more specifically.
   ``We did not go (to Washington) to ask for more sanctions,''
Tutu said in a speech Wednesday night. ``We went to ask for help to
get negotiations going that would bring an end to apartheid and to
usher in the new South Africa.''

<TEXT>
   Israel has jailed at least 5,000 Palestinians
without trial since the uprising began, many of them non-violent
opponents kept in harsh conditions and deprived of adequate legal
counsel, Amnesty International says.
   In a report released today, the London-based human rights
movement says most of the so-called ``administrative detainees''
are held in tents that give little protection from desert
conditions.
   Amnesty said Israel's use of administrative detention, or
imprisonment without trial, for non-violent opponents violates
``fundamental human rights.''
   It called for all administrative detentions to ``be urgently
reviewed,'' with prisoners held for non-violent activity to ``be
released immediately and unconditionally.''
   Israel denied its army was violating the human rights of
non-violent opponents. ``People are being held because of violent
activities, not because of their ideas,'' Avi Pazner, an aide to
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said in Jerusalem. ``Israel does not
use administrative detention lightly.''
   Amnesty says most detainees are held for six months and that at
least 1,100 Palestinians are in administrative detention, most of
them at Ketziot detention center in the Negev Desert.
   Accommodations are poor, consisting of tents that give little
protection from desert temperatures and rain; medical services are
inadequate; family visits are restricted, the camp is overcrowded
and there are thrice-daily roll calls ``regarded by most detainees
as a form of punishment,'' the report says.
   It also mentions ``the seemingly arbitrary use of solitary
confinement'' and enforced standing, and ``the repeated and
possibly unjustified use of tear gas and firearms within the camp.''
   ``Some administrative detainees seem to have been held illegally
as court orders for their release or for reduction of their
detention have apparently been disregarded by the camp
authorities,'' the report says.
   There have been several riots and a hunger strike, and the
Israeli High Court has criticized conditions in Ketziot,
recommending that a committee headed by a military judge be set up
to monitor conditions, Amnesty said.
   As of April, no committee had been set up, it added.
   The Israelis inherited powers of administrative detention from
the British, who ruled the land until 1948, and assert that ``it is
warranted by the special security situation and the danger the
state suffers from terrorism,'' Amnesty said. It acknowledged that
detentions fell sharply in the late 1970s, from 1,130 in 1970 to 20
or 30 in 1978.
   But it said the practice has become widespread since the
intefadeh, or uprising, begain in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip in December 1987.
   It is now used against ``all sections of Palestinian society ...
laborers and the unemployed, trade unionists, students,
journalists, doctors, lawyers, academics, teachers, members of
voluntary organizations and human rights workers,'' the Amnesty
report says.
   It says that in March 1988, Israel abolished the detainees'
right to prompt automatic review of their arrest and empowered
officers down to the rank of colonel to issue six-month detention
orders.
   Detainees have since had to wait weeks or even months for an
appeal hearing, and their lawyers are denied sufficient specific
information to challenge the detention order, it says.
   The report says Israeli authorities ``distinguish between those
who have and those who have not committed acts of violence,'' but
ignore the distinction if they believe the activity is ``political
subversion'' that threatens security.
   Amnesty rejects the Israeli view that anyone who supports or
campaigns for the Palestine Liberation Organization automatically
supports violence.
   It recognizes that PLO factions ``carry out both violent and
non-violent protest,'' and believes that a person can support the
PLO ``without themselves espousing or engaging in violence.''
   The report says Israel's existing procedures for reviewing cases
of imprisonment without trial are ``insufficient to prevent abuse
of the detainees' right to challenge the detention, particularly
their right to be informed promptly and fully of the reasons for
their detention.''
   Also, judges show an ``apparent reluctance'' to question
evidence provided by the secret services or to challenge the
authorities when they say information is being withheld from the
detainee because it is classified, the report says.
   It suggests Israel abolish the measure altogether, or at least
review the grounds on which detention orders are issued and give
the detainee, immediately upon arrest, in writing, ``specific and
individualized reasons for the arrest.''

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called
on the government to reprieve all prisoners on Death Row, including
a white extremist sentenced to hang for killing seven blacks and an
Indian man.
   Speaking at a church meeting Wednesday night, the black Anglican
leader called for abolition of the death penalty and an amnesty for
the more than 200 prisoners on Death Row.
   ``I include even Barend Strydom, who is a child and product fed
on the hatred and contempt that are the logical consequences of
apartheid,'' said Tutu, referring to the 23-year-old former
policeman condemned in Pretoria Supreme Court last week.
   Strydom, who testified that he considered blacks to be animals,
shot and killed seven people and wounded 16 blacks during a
shooting spree on the sidewalks of downtown Pretoria in November.
   A week earlier, he killed one black woman and wounded another at
a squatter camp in what he described as a practice attack.
   In calling for reprieves, Tutu mentioned the so-called Upington
14 _ a black woman and 13 black men sentenced last week to hang for
complicity in the mob killing of a black policeman during township
unrest in 1985. Only one of the 14 was found to have contributed
physically to the death pf the policeman.
   ``It makes you shudder that we can sentence 14 people to death
at one fell swoop,'' said Tutu. ``That includes a lady of 60 years
of age.''

   Upwardly mobile roof rats who prefer
California's newer neighborhoods are invading pricey homes, using
newly planted vines and trees as an above-ground freeway, health
officials said.
   Twice during the past two weeks, wrecker rats have driven Lance
Finkel out of his home in Oakland's Montclair district, a
neighborhood of $300,000-plus houses in the hills overlooking the
city.
   ``They're chewing the house apart,'' said Finkel. ``They're
chewing up the doors and pulling the carpet up, they've chewed
through the bottom of an armoire. ... They're driving me out of the
house.''
   Even an exterminator wasn't able to solve the problem for
Finkel, who is hoping Alameda County's Vector Control unit can stop
the infestation.
   The baby boom among roof rats is keeping pace with California's
population rise, which saw the number of residents jump 662,000, to
28.3 million, this year.
   The rodents, which use telephone lines and overhanging trees to
travel from city to suburb, are moving in where there was never a
problem before, health officials said.
   ``There's a lot of development taking place all over the state.
And all these developments are putting in new landscaping. As it
matures, this vegetation provides ideal habitat for roof rats,''
said Richard Yercott, a State Health Department biologist.
   Complaints about Norway sewer rats, the larger more aggressive
cousin found in city slums and waterfronts, used to dominate rat
complaints in Oakland and the adjacent suburban counties, but not
any more.
   ``For years the Norways were the prevailing animals, but I think
the roof rat is quickly catching up,'' said John Chase, a
technician in Contra Costa County's rodent control unit. Chase says
50 percent of his office's calls are about roof rats now.
   Alameda County roof rat complaints have increased 50 percent
during the past five years, particularly in Oakland's hill areas,
said Harry Scott, manager of Alameda County's Vector Control
district.
   Sometimes the rats come indoors: ``They suddenly get curious and
invade a home'' and that's when the real trouble begins, Scott said.
   One Oakland hills resident called Scott's office when roof rats
scurrying through his house set off the motion detector in his home
security system.
   In Pleasant Hill, a resident had so many nesting roof rats in
her wall that they destroyed her insulation and wiring, Scott said.
   Roof rats can carry a considerable number of disease-causing
parasites, and their bites are the biggest worry, Scott said.
Alameda County averages about five rat bite cases a year, he said.

<HEAD>Party Rivals Put Forth Another Candidate for Prime Minister</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A faction in the governing Liberal Democratic Party
today offered its own candidate to succeed Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita after objecting to the choice of the party leaders.
   Legislator Shizuka Kamei said Ganri Yamashita, a former Cabinet
member and political foe of Takeshita's, would run against Foreign
Minister Sousuke Uno.
   On Wednesday, Uno, 66, agreed to take the job after leaders in
the scandal-tainted party decided he was the best person for the
job.
   But members of several of the party's major factions opposed Uno
because he is a senior member of the faction of former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. It was during Nakasone's 1982-87 tenure
that the so-called Recruit scandal developed.
   ``This is the will of the people, who oppose the party's
decision on Mr. Uno's candidacy,'' Kamei said. ``We asked Mr.
Yamashita to stand for us, and he said he would.''
   The 68-year-old Yamashita said he accepted the offer to run.
   Share prices slumped on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, in part due to
nervousness about a split in the pro-business Liberal Democratic
Party, dealers said. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues shed 285.40 points, or 0.83 percent, to finish at 33,981.35.
   Yamashita represents the same constituency in Shiga prefecture
as Uno. He served as director-general of the Defense Agency under
Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira in the late 1970's.
   Kamei's Liberal Progressive Alliance has 48 members in the Diet,
Japan's parliament. Kamei said he would have no trouble getting the
required 50 signatures to back Yamashita's candidacy and force a
vote between the candidates.
   Takeshita is resigning to take responsibility for the Recruit
scandal, which has stained the top ranks of politics, business and
the bureaucracy. The Recruit Co. is an information services
conglomerate that offered cut-rate priced shares to political and
business leaders, allegedly to win favors.
   Many of the Liberal Democratic Party's top leaders have been
deemed ineligible for the prime minister's job because they have
been linked to the scandal.
   Business leaders welcomed the choice of Uno, noting he gained
international experience as foreign minister since November 1987
and was untainted by the scandal.
   The Liberal Democrats need someone with an untarnished image to
boost their popularity before elections this summer for half of
parliament's upper house. It took more than a month to find such a
person after Takeshita announced on April 25 that he would resign.
   Party leaders first approached the party's Executive Council
chairman, Masayoshi Ito, 75, but he refused the job, citing poor
health and dissatisfaction with the party's handling of reforms.

   Barbara Bush confessed today that her pie crust
was nothing to brag about.
   During a relaxed visit to an adult education center in Brixton,
south London, the first lady visited a cooking class where students
were busy making strudel pastry, noisily slapping mounds of dough
on countertops.
   Stephanie Rees, an American teacher who has lived in Britain for
18 years, persuaded Mrs. Bush to try her hand at stretching some
dough.
   ``Notice, I washed my hands,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   ``Oooh, that feels wonderful,'' she said as she worked the
dough. ``This is sort of fun.''
   She said she had never made that kind of pastry.
   ``My pie crust is not one you write home about, you know what I
mean,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I envy you. This is gorgeous.''
   While President Bush conferred with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher at 10 Downing Street, Mrs. Bush spent 75 minutes touring
cooking, English-language and fashion design classes and visiting a
day care center at the Lambeth Institute's Strand Center.
   ``As you know, I am very interested in adult literacy and family
literacy,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I am putting my focus in the United
States on family literacy.''
   ``This is a marvelous coalition of public agencies,'' she said.
``It's been a very exciting morning for me. Everything impressed me
about it.''
   The school's mostly primary education classes at the sprawling
red brick school attract about 2,000 students a week, two-thirds of
them from London's ethnic communities.
   Mrs. Bush wore a black and white polka dot and plaid outfit and
a three-strand pearl choker for her only solo appearance during the
Bushes' two-day stay in London.
   One fashion student, Icema Paschal, told Mrs. Bush she was
wearing a dress she had made especially for the occasion. The first
lady complimented Icema on her creation.
   In the day care center, toddler Cicely Convoy gave Mrs. Bush a
kiss and a basket of pink roses and carnations.
   Afterward, Ms. Paschal said, ``I think she's quite down to
earth, quite nice. She's quite a relaxed person.''
   Tutor Gulshan Ramzan said, ``It was wonderful. My students,
although mentally handicapped, they were so excited.''
   ``I applaud her enormously for coming here,'' said Neil
Fletcher, a council member of the Inner London Education Authority
who served as Mrs. Bush's guide. He criticized the government's
plans to abolish the authority, which will force the center to rely
on the local funds.

   The president's wife, Barbara Bush, delighted
photographers and television cameras at 10 Downing Street today
with an impulsive kiss to the hand of Denis Thatcher, the spouse of
the British prime minister.
   Thatcher was waiting outside the prime minister's front door to
greet Mrs. Bush while their mates met for nearly two hours within
on a wide range of international issues, including the recent NATO
decisions on arms control approaches to the Soviet Union.
   When the U.S. Secret Service rushed Mrs. Bush to the door,
Thatcher, in European style, kissed her hand.
   Photographers asked for one more shot as Thatcher and Mrs. Bush
parted.
   A wide smile on her face, Mrs. Bush turned around, grabbed
Thatcher's hand and planted a big kiss on it.

   Here is a transcript of the remarks of President
Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher Thursday to reporters
outside the prime minister's residence.
   President Bush:
   On behalf of our entire traveling squad, she and I talked in
detail about a wide array of issues. And I want to thank her and I
want to assert here that the special relationship that has existed
between the Unted Kingdom and the United States is continuing and
will continue.
   And, once again, Madame Prime Minister, my sincere thanks to you
for a very encouraging and frank exchange that we had. It's only
with friends that you can take off the gloves and talk from the
heart.
   And I felt that I was with a friend today and I can assure the
people in the United Kingdom that, from our side of the Atlantic,
this relationship is strong and will continue to be.
   Mrs. Thatcher:
   Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. The president comes here
after a very, very successful NATO summit, due to the leadership of
the United States under the presidency of George Bush.
   We talked about the follow-up to these matters. We talked also
about the very difficult situation in the Middle East. We talked
about the situation in China. We talked about matters in South
Africa. And we have talked about matters in the Argentine and in
Central America. And so, I think you will agree we have covered an
extremely wide range of subjects.
   And yet the morning has been too short. We spoke together for
about an hour and three-quarters, and then joined our foreign
ministers and Mr. Scowcroft. And they, too, had considered some of
these matters and others.
   We then also talked about the problems in Cambodia and the
problems with the Vietnamese boat people still going to Hong Kong.
   So you can see that we have compressed a great deal into the
time. We think very much the same way, which isn't surprising.
   And we're absolutely delighted that we have in President Bush a
president of the United States who is staunch and steadfast on
everything which is of fundamental value to democracy, freedom and
justice and the necessity to keep our countries secure and yet
forever stretching out the hand of friendship with other nations
across the European divide, trying to extend to the world some of
the benefits which we enjoy but take for granted.
   We are in a period when, as the president has said in some of
his most excellent speeches, it's the end of containment; it's
freedom on the offensive, a peaceful offensive throughout the world.
   I think they have been some of the most valuable and happy talks
I have had for a very long time. And we thank and congratulate the
president. ...
   Q: Is Britain still America's most important ally in Europe?
   Thatcher: I think you might put it more tactfully. America has
allies throughout Europe and throughout the free world. I would
like to think that we pride ourselves of being among the foremost
of the United States' friends. And we will always be. I think it's
quite wrong that, because you have one friend, you should exclude
the possibility of other friendships as well. And I'm sure the
president doesn't and I don't. We both have many friends in Europe.
   Bush: Very good answer.
   Q: Mr. Bush, could I ask you, do you think that West Germany and
France will increasingly share the spotlight in the so-called
special relationship you have with Mrs. Thatcher?
   Bush: I think that the special relationship that I referred to
in my opening remarks speaks for itself. And I think the remarks
that the prime minister just made about her propensity for
friendship with other nations and the United States' friendship
with other nations _ those remarks speak for themselves. And so I
would simply say I expect this relationship to continue on the
steady keel because it is so fundamentally based on common values.
   And the NATO alliance, for example, is not going to divide up in
to inside cliques of who is the closest friend to whom. But the
point I want to make here is I value the judgment, the conviction,
the principled stance of Prime Minister Thatcher.
   I've been privileged to know her and work with her in, for me, a
lesser capacity, for eight years. And this visit alone, as we cross
many, many borders and discuss the problems that face us, reassures
me and just reaffirms what I have always felt _ that we have a
very, very special relationship. But it needn't be at the expense
of our friendship with other countries.
   Thatcher: Just one more ... one more.
   Q: Mr. Bush, what exactly can Britain do to bring about this
further freedom in Eastern Europe that you said you want to see.
   Bush: Well, they've already done one step, and that is to help
NATO come out with a very sound proposal.
   I can tell you the prime minister and her able foreign minister
helped shape this whole NATO proposal and communique, which both of
us think is a very forward-looking document adhering to principles.
So it's not a question of the future; they've already performed
since I've been here in the last few days a very useful, very
useful role. And there are many other areas where just on bilateral
basis that I'm sure the United Kingdom can influence and encourage
this trend to democracy that the prime minister referred to, many
other areas. The U.K. is widely respected in Eastern Europe.
   Thatcher: Thank you. I think Mrs. Bush awaits. Mrs. Bush awaits.
No, that was the last question. Thank you for coming.

   A man convicted only of manslaughter
for shooting his estranged wife, a judge, to death in her
courthouse chambers should get the stiffest possible sentence,
angry protesters said.
   A thousand people rallied Wednesday outside the county Hall of
Justice to protest the manslaughter conviction of former police
officer Clarence Ratliff in the death of District Judge Carol
Irons. Irons, who has been described as a supporter of victims of
family violence, was killed last October.
   On May 11, a jury acquitted Ratliff of first-degree murder,
which carries a possible sentence of life in prison without parole.
Ratliff, 53, had testified that he was drunk and upset over their
impending divorce and did not mean to kill Irons, who was 40. The
lesser charge of manslaughter carries a possible sentence of up to
15 years.
   But the jury also convicted the 21-year police veteran of
attempted murder for firing at two officers who tried to help Irons.
   ``We are outraged that the murder of a woman is considered less
serious than shooting at _ and missing _ two men,'' said one
protester, Dotti Clune. She described the jury's decision as a
``slap-on-the-hand verdict.''
   ``Carol Irons was not manslaughtered. She was murdered,'' said
another speaker, psychologist Sherry Redding.
   More than 1,000 letters have been sent to Kent County Circuit
Judge Dennis Kolenda, urging the maximum allowable prison term at
Ratliff's June 12 sentencing.
   Attempted murder carries a possible sentence of life in prison
with possibility of parole. But Michigan Attorney General Frank
Kelley has recommended that Ratliff be sentenced to 25 to 40 years
in prison because those sentenced to life can be paroled after 10
years and those who get 25 to 40 years generally serve at least 20
years.
   The protesters did not specify the sentence they want the judge
to give but said it should be the harshest possible.
   Kolenda said he was reading each letter.
   ``A judge has to walk a tightrope,'' he said after the rally.
``Some decisions must be made by the letter of the law and some
decisions must take into account community sentiment.''

<HEAD>Two Men Convicted Of Murdering British Soldiers in Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men were convicted and
sentenced to life in prison today for murdering two British
soldiers who were beaten and shot after apparently straying into
the funeral of an IRA member.
   Lord Chief Justice Sir Brian Hutton recommended that Alex
Murphy, 31, and Harry Maguire, 29, each serve at least 25 years
before being eligible for release.
   Both men pleaded innocent, and neither was accused of firing the
shots that killed Cpls. Derek Wood, 24, and David Howes, 23, on
March 19, 1988. Police are continuing their investigation.
   Hutton presided over a 32-day trial in which army film and
television news videotapes were a key to the prosecution's case.
   The soldiers drove into the path of mourners at the funeral for
Kevin Brady. He was one of three Roman Catholics killed when a
Protestant, Michael Stone, opened fire at an Irish Republican Army
funeral March 16.
   The IRA, which is outlawed in Northern Ireland, has been
fighting a 20-year guerrilla war against British rule of the
province.
   TV film showed Wood and Howes surrounded by a crowd that
hammered their car and dragged them out.
   Film taken from an army helicopter showed the men then being
beaten, stripped and driven off in a black taxi. They later were
shot to death.
   Murphy wrestled one of the soldiers to the ground. Maguire was
seen helping get the soldiers into the taxi.
   Murphy also was shown standing near the soldiers in Penny Lane,
where they were shot. Maguire was seen getting out of the taxi,
before the gunmen arrived, and fighting with Howes.
   Wood was shot twice in the head. Howes was shot in the head at
close range.
   The unidentified gunman passed the weapon to another man who
fired a shot into Wood's body, then another at Howes' body.
   Murphy and Maguire, both of Belfast, were also convicted of
possessing a weapon, false imprisonment and causing grievous bodily
harm.
   The news film, confiscated from the British Broadcasting Corp.,
Independent Television News and Radio Telefis Eireann _ Ireland's
national network _ was supplemented by an anonymously photographed
video. Detectives said they examined a quarter of a million still
frames taken from 17 hours of tape.
   The trial was the first of five involving the soldiers' deaths.
Twenty-seven other men face a variety of charges ranging from
assault to kidnapping.

   A woman who dangled from a rope for about an hour
after rappelling from the eighth floor of the state Transportation
Building says she did it to protest U.S. aid to El Salvador.
   Rebecca A. Pierce, 45, a self-employed carpenter, was arrested
on charges of disorderly conduct after she remained suspended 50 to
60 feet above the ground in the building's atrium, said police
spokesman Scott Gillis. She was released on her own recognizance.
   Pierce dropped leaflets urging U.S. Sen. John Kerry, whose
office is in the building, to work toward halting aid to El
Salvador.
   ``I think I got the message out,'' she said. ``I hope Kerry will
seriously consider changing his vote and not keep sending money to
the death squads.''
   Pierce, who said she has a fear of heights even though she has
been rock climbing for 18 years, is a member of the Boston
Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador.
   In a statement from Washington, Kerry said: ``I appreciate the
woman's concern and I'm very sensitive to the passion she and
others display on this issue. We are working on a policy that will
hold all sides accountable.''
   Firefighters set up air bags beneath Pierce before hooking her
rope from the sixth floor and swinging her over to a landing.

<HEAD>Letter From Rome Upholds Order for Barricaded Nuns to Leave Monastery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four nuns barricaded in their
monastery's infirmary will continue their eight-month protest
against liberalizations in their lifestyle despite a renewed call
from the Vatican to end the standoff.
   The Paterson Diocese announced Wednesday that Vatican officials
had rejected the nuns' appeal and again ordered them to leave the
building of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel.
   However, a spokeswoman for the nuns says they will not leave.
   The nuns fled to the infirmary on Oct. 4, saying they feared
eviction for protesting changes to their monastery, such as
introduction of television and sweets. Diocese officials said the
issue was the nuns' refusal to obey their prioress, Mother Teresa
Hewitt.
   Betty Sutton, spokeswoman for the nuns, said the letter from The
Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of
Apostolic Life ordering the nuns to leave was an answer to a March
appeal. But an appeal filed in July 1988 on other issues remains
unanswered, and the nuns will not leave the monastery until it is,
she said.
   ``They're going to go on just the way they have been,'' Mrs.
Sutton said. ``There's still an appeal out there and they're still
going to keep waiting for an answer.''
   The nuns have said they were awaiting an answer from the
Apostolica Signatura, the Vatican's highest court.
   But in a separate letter to Bishop Frank Rodimer, bishop of the
diocese, Cardinal Achille Silvestrini, Prefect of the Apostolica
Signatura, said ``there is no recourse pending before this Supreme
Tribunal concerning'' the nuns.
   In letters from Rome to each of the women, the Congregation said
in its most recent ruling: ``The problem has been carefully
re-examined from all points of view. The good of your soul, the
safeguarding of the values of religious life, respect for the
established authority and the witness we have to render to the
Church, convinces us to confirm what has been decided.''
   The excerpt from the letter was made available by Timothy
Manning, spokesman for the Paterson Diocese.
   Manning said there has been no discussion on what to do with the
nuns if they again refuse to leave the monastery. The Carmelite
community could decide to remove them from their vows, he said.
   The vows of two of the nuns expired during the protest. A fifth
nun left the monastery March 19, citing health reasons.

<HEAD>Skimpy Bathing Suits Banned in North Myrtle Beach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bottom has fallen out of
beach wear this summer, and that's upsetting people who would
rather look the other way.
   ``We've had maybe a dozen young women we have asked to cover up
or leave the beach,'' said city waterfront director Norma Jean Page.
   Part of her job lately has been to keep the beach free of the
near nudity of thong or G-string bathing suits which leave the
bottom bare.
   ``It's really no big deal. We just tell them we have had a city
ordinance since 1976 against revealing certain parts of the body,
including the buttocks. When they understand that, they are very
nice and leave,'' she said.
   The suits are specifically outlawed in North Myrtle Beach. But
women who sport the skimpy wear have not been fined or hauled off
to jail, just asked to leave the beach.
   Mark Kalb of the Pineapple Beach Surf Shop said the trend
started in earnest last year and the open-air suits are even more
popular this season.
   ``These suits don't appeal to the conservatives, although
everybody pretty much takes a look at them.''
   South of North Myrtle Beach, in Myrtle Beach, there are no
specific bans _ except for outright nudity _ and few complaints
about the risque swimsuits.
   ``We looked at the same ordinance North Myrtle Beach has, but
our biggest problem would be with enforcement,'' said Myrtle Beach
city clerk Mandy Tomz.
   ``There is such a wide area of beach to cover, and there are so
many people on the beach, it would be very difficult to pick and
choose whom to send away, and that would not be received well.''

<HEAD>Eds: Top 6 grafs new with Michel quotes; picks up 4th graf pvs, When

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, who initiated the
investigation of Speaker Jim Wright, has to be ``much more
responsible'' as House Republican whip than he was as a junior
member, GOP Leader Bob Michel said today.
   ``Everyone's free to do their own thing in a sense,'' Michel
said on ``CBS This Morning.'' He pointed out that Gingrich, R-Ga.,
``was catapulted into the leadership'' when then-Rep. Dick Cheney,
R-Wyo., was picked as defense secretary.
   ``He's got to be much more responsible than he was as a junior
member of Congress,'' Michel said. ``He recognizes that, I think.
I've already detected somewhat of a change in his deportment on the
floor of the House. It's a learning process for him.''
   Gingrich ducked out of the House chamber without a word to
reporters after Wright's resignation.
   Gingrich aides said the GOP whip decided just before Wright's
speech Wednesday that he would not comment. He stayed on the House
floor for nearly an hour to avoid being confronted by reporters,
then left through an undisclosed exit.
   Gingrich sat next to Michel of Illinois. He sat impassively
through most of the speech with his hands folded in his lap.
   When Democrats stood up and broke into applause after Wright
called for an end to ``this period of mindless cannibalism'' in the
House, Gingrich conferred briefly with Michel, then grinned and
joined other Republicans in rising.
   Gingrich's refusal to comment on Wright's resignation was in
sharp contrast to the high-profile ethics campaign he has waged for
nearly two years against Wright and other House Democrats.
   Democrats reacted to his barrage of charges early this year by
filing their own complaint against Gingrich with the House ethics
committee. The complaint, which is still pending before the
committee, alleges that Gingrich violated House rules with a
partnership he created in 1984 to promote his book, ``Window of
Opportunity.''

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to clarify that doctor asked not to be identified.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor who specializes in Lyme disease
increasingly finds his waiting room crowded with patients who don't
have it.
   ``Every year we get a new pop disease and you get all these
stressed out people who think they have it,'' said the doctor, who
practices in the Northeast and asked not to be identified. ``A lot
of them don't have it. They're depressed or have other ills.''
   He blames it on what might be called the Great Lyme Disease
Scare of 1989.
   The news reports began as soon as the weather was nice enough
for a walk in the woods. They warned that Lyme disease is marching
across the country, can go undiagnosed and can do serious damage to
the joints and nervous system.
   Those frightening assertions are true, as far as they go.
   But nearly all Lyme disease cases are confined to eight hot
spots in the Northeast and Midwest, most cases are easily cured and
simple preventive measures can sharply cut the likelihood of
getting it.
   ``In most of the states, only small numbers of cases have been
reported,'' said Dr. Theodore Tsai of the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control laboratory in Fort Collins, Colo.
   Ninety percent of the nation's cases occur in the Northeast,
half in New York state and 40 percent in just two counties _
Westchester, immediately north of New York City, and Suffolk,
covering the eastern half of Long Island.
   Even in those areas, the risk can be lowered by wearing insect
repellent and inspecting for ticks.
   ``It's important that people don't feel helpless or powerless in
the face of this problem. And when they do get Lyme disease, when
it's detected at an early stage, most people respond to therapy and
recover,'' Tsai said.
   The eight Lyme disease hot spots are New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Minnesota
and Wisconsin.
   ``If you live in those areas, Lyme disease is an immensely
important problem. No question about it. But people living
elsewhere shouldn't get the impression from reading the eastern
papers that it's as big a problem where they live,'' Tsai said.
   Lyme disease was identified in 1975 by Dr. Allen Steere, then of
Yale University and now of the New England Medical Center in
Boston. The first cases were picked up near Old Lyme, Conn.
   It soon became clear the disease was spread by ticks found on
deer, mice and other mammals. In 1982, researchers discovered it
was caused by corkscrew-shaped bacteria carried by the ticks.
   Between 1980 and 1988 some 14,000 cases were reported in the
United States, according to the CDC. The actual numbers may be
several times that _ doctors can only guess. More than one-third of
the cases, or about 5,000, occurred in 1988. The disease is clearly
on the rise, and has been reported in 43 states, so it is
spreading. But it remains uncommon outside the hot spots.
   Much has been made of the serious complications that can
sometimes arise from Lyme disease. It can affect the joints and the
nervous system, causing permanent damage. If not treated early, it
can be tough to cure, requiring extensive treatment with expensive
intravenous antibiotics.
   Lyme disease also is the great impostor. It can look like
arthritis, flu, heart disease, palsy and, in advanced stages,
Alzheimer's disease, meningitis and multiple sclerosis.
   The concern is that the diagnosis might be missed, along with
the chance to treat it when it's easily curable. Some news reports
have focused on cases in which undiagnosed Lyme disease has caused
crippling nerve and joint damage.
   ``The thing I think is being lost in all of this is that in the
majority of people this is a pretty benign disease,'' said Dr.
Raymond Dattwyler of the State University of New York in Stony
Brook. Antibiotics can generally clear it up quickly.
   Diagnosis is not as tricky as it's been made out to be, he said.
``It's not a vague disease with aches and pains.''
   In two-thirds of the cases, it begins with a characteristic
bull's-eye rash, a red ring around a clear center. It also causes
specific kinds of nerve and joint damage that doctors can readily
identify as Lyme disease.
   Furthermore, blood tests can usually confirm the diagnosis.
``It's been talked about that the blood test is not very good,''
said Steere. ``I think it's better than it's generally being
reported in the press.''
   Dattwyler's office is in Suffolk County, where the incidence of
Lyme disease has approximately doubled each year for the past three
years. Despite that sharp increase, he and his colleagues have cut
the Lyme disease rate in half in employees of nearby Fire Island
National Seashore.
   ``These are people who work in the brush in one of the most
highly endemic areas in the world,'' said Dattwyler. ``Basically
what we teach them is to recognize what the tick looks like, how to
avoid exposure, how to remove the ticks, and really stress that you
do have time before the infection occurs.''
   Ticks must feed for 24 hours to 48 hours in order to transmit
the infection, he said. If they're found and pulled off carefully
with tweezers or fingers at the end of the day, infection is
unlikely.
   People who find ticks on themselves shouldn't rush to the
doctors to be tested for Lyme disease, Dattwyler said. It takes
four to six weeks to develop antibodies to the Lyme disease bug,
and that's when the blood test can show infection. It would be
reasonable to have the test done then, he said.
   Lyme disease is likely to continue its spread, and it may
ultimately become an important disease outside the current hot
spots.
   Ticks are probably hitching rides around the country on
migratory birds. And changing land use is putting people's homes
closer to the woods and brush where ticks live, said Tsai.
   Nevertheless, he said, the problem has been overblown. Emphasis
on problem cases and tough diagnoses has ``overshadowed what we
know can be done to prevent it. It is more spectacular to talk
about a mystery disease.''

<HEAD>Sri Lanka Wants Indian Troops Out Within Two Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president said today he will ask
India to withdraw its peacekeeping troops from Sri Lanka by the end
of July.
   Also today, suspected Sinhalese extremists shot and killed a
senior police detective and set a bomb that killed a provincial
city council member.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa, who took office five months ago,
repeatedly has said he wants India's soldiers to withdraw, but his
announcement today was the first time he set a date.
   ``During my election campaign I pledged to ask the Indian troops
to leave. This pledge I will keep,'' Premadasa told a Buddhist
gathering at a temple in Battaramula, seven miles southeast of
Colombo.
   The first Indian force of 3,000 soldiers arrived in Sri Lanka on
July 30, 1987, under a peace plan signed by Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi and Premadasa's predecessor, Julius R. Jayewardene.
   The contingent swelled to 70,000 as Indian troops tried to
disarm guerrillas from the Tamil Hindu minority, whose separatist
war against the Sinhalese Buddhist majority has claimed 9,000 lives
since 1983. An estimated 45,000 Indian soldiers are still deployed
in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, where most Tamils live and hope
to set up a homeland.
   ``I will shortly ask Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to mark
the second anniversary by totally withdrawing the Indian army from
this country,'' Premadasa said.
   More than 700 Indian soldiers have died in the peacekeeping
campaign.
   Premadasa said Sri Lanka was grateful for the sacrifices made by
India, but he added: ``We will also be grateful if India agrees to
withdraw its troops from this country.''
   India has said from the outset of its involvement in Sri Lanka
that it had no plans to stay indefinitely. India joined the
conflict under pressure from its own powerful Tamil minority of 60
million.
   The 1987 accord led to a violent campaign by the militant
Sinhalese People's Liberation Front against the Sri Lankan
government, which it said made too many concessions to Tamils. The
ultranationalist Sinhalese have been blamed for 3,500 deaths in the
war.
   Sinhalese extremists today shot and killed police detective
Bennet Perera as his car passed through Ratmalana, 10 miles from
the city center, police said. Perera headed a special unit
investigating the ultranationalists.
   In the second incident today, Sinhalese militants threw a bomb
at the home of Leslie Ranagala, a governing United National Party
provincial city council member, that killing him and his guard.
   No group claimed responsibility for the killings.
   The Tamil guerrilla campaign grew out of the ethnic minority's
charges that the Sinhalese discriminated against them.
   Sinhalese, who form 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
dominate the government and military. Tamils make up 18 percent of
the island off southern India formerly known as Ceylon.
   Under Premadasa, the government has opened negotiations on
ending the civil war with leaders of the most powerful Tamil rebel
group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The militant
Sinhalese, however, have refused to particiapte.

<DATELINE>BAL HARBOUR, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1989 Atlantic hurricane season,
which began today, should be milder than last year's, a leading
storm forecaster says.
   Colorado State University professor William Gray predicted
Wednesday that there would be only four hurricanes and seven
tropical storms during the season, which runs through Nov. 30.
   ``This will be a below-average year in the number of hurricanes,
and they will be less intense,'' Gray, a teacher of atmospheric
sciences, told a conference of the American Meteorological Society.
   In the last six years, Gray has made near-perfect predictions
about the number of hurricanes formed in the Atlantic, using reams
of data on such things as ocean temperature patterns.
   Last year, there were six hurricanes, including Gilbert, a
particularly strong storm that killed more than 300 people and
wrought heavy damage in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and
Mexico; and Joan, which devastated parts of Nicaragua. In addition,
there were five tropical storms.
   Weather disturbances that begin in the tropics are classified as
tropical storms, and given a name, when their sustained winds reach
39 mph. They are classified as hurricanes if their winds reach 74
mph.
   During the average Atlantic season 10 tropical storms develop
and six of them become hurricanes.
   In Coral Gables, the National Hurricane Center on Wednesday
released the 21 names that will be given 1989 hurricanes and
tropical storms in the Atlantic.
   The names are: Allison, Barry, Chantal, Dean, Erin, Felix,
Gabrielle, Hugo, Iris, Jerry, Karen, Luis, Marilyn, Noel, Opal,
Pablo, Roxanne, Sebastien, Tanya, Van and Wendy.
   Bob Sheets, director of the hurricane center, cautioned that
apathy and unfamiliarity with the destructive power of a major
hurricane could prove fatal.
   In his annual hurricane awareness warning Wednesday, Sheets
said: ``If a major storm strikes a coastal metropolitian center
this year, the risk of fatalities is high because the endangered
population will face congested evacuation routes, insufficient
escape and too little experience in hurricane survival.''
   His comments were echoed by other disaster officials, who said
they fear that newcomers to a region and tourists, in particular,
sometimes don't take storm warnings seriously enough.
   ``Getting people to take hurricanes seriously is the biggest
problem,'' said Rick Scofield, assistant director of Disaster
Services for Miami's Red Cross. ``When a community goes a long time
without a major storm, they're less sensitive to the danger.''

<TEXT>
   The new Soviet Congress today formed a commission
to determine whether the Kremlin absorbed the three Baltic
republics by force under a secret accord with Nazi Germany.
   The Congress acted after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the
issue needs to be investigated. But he also told the Congress the
original copy of the agreement can't be found, either in the Soviet
Union or in West Germany.
   The dispute over the 1939 German-Soviet non-aggression pact is
explosive because decades of official Soviet doctrine maintain that
the republics _ Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania _ voluntarily joined
the Soviet Union in 1940, ending their existence as independent
nations.
   But secret protocols to the 1939 pact, concluded by the foreign
ministers of Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin, deeded control of the
Baltic area to the Kremlin, and Soviet troops moved in the next
year.
   Baltic activists, now freer to express themselves because of
Gorbachev's political reforms, demand that the official explanation
of how their homelands came to be part of the Soviet Union be
exposed as a lie.
   A Baltic deputy proposed creation of the commission, but the
conservative majority of the Congress of People's Deputies was
grumbling loudly and appeared to be leaning toward rejecting the
idea when Gorbachev intervened.
   ``The Baltics are in turmoil,'' over the question, he said, and
it needs to be investigated.
   The secret additions to the Hitler-Stalin pact have long been
known in the West, but Gorbachev told the Congress no one has been
able to locate the originals.
   Gorbachev said that when Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany
visited Moscow last year he asked Kohl if the originals were in
West Germany.
   Kohl said they were, Gorbachev said, and the Soviets asked for
them. But when Soviet diplomats went to West Germany to get the
documents, they were told the originals couldn't be found,
Gorbachev said.

<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's sweeping
proposals to curb drunken driving brought sharp criticism today
from the restaurant and lcoholic beverage industries, which say
they were intentionally left off a panel that drafted them.
   ``This report contains a few good recommendations and many that
are both misdirected and destructive,'' said Harris Rusitzky,
president of the National Restaurant Association.
   Koop on Wednesday asked for a ban on some alcohol promotion and
advertising he says is aimed at youths. In one of his last official
acts before leaving office July 13, Koop also called for higher
taxes on liquor, tougher state laws and enforcement against drunken
driving and far-reaching voluntary action by the industry.
   Rusitzky, whose organization represents 100,000 establishments,
said a majority of Koop's recommendations were designed to reduce
the availability of alcoholic beverages to responsible drinkers.
   ``The major thrust of the report, if implemented, could actually
make the problem worse,'' said Gerald E. Murphy, director of the
National Licensed Beverage Association, which calls itself a voice
for half a million bars and taverns.
   Murphy said Koop's proposed restrictions on alcohol
distribution, new axes and other proposals would force the closing
of thousands of neighborhood taverns.
   ``This will not lead to less drinking. It will lead to less
supervised drinking,'' he said.
   James C. Sanders, head of the Beer Institute, which represents
breweries, said Koop's proposals fail to consider that drunken
driving deaths have dropped 17 percent over the past five years,
with teen-age drunk driving fatalities down by nearly one-third.
   He said many of Koop's suggestions will either not work or
impinge on the right of free speech by restricting product
advertising and marketing.
   Several industry representatives criticized Koop for not
inviting them to participate on the panel in December that drew up
his recommendations. It included experts from five federal agencies
and scores of doctors, lawyers, anti-alcohol campaigners.
Advertising groups were invited but declined to participate.
   ``Surgeon General Koop has endorsed a drastic series of
proposals that would dramatically increase the level of government
intrusion into our private lives without a significant effect on
the alcohol abuse problem,'' said Stephen Lambright, vice president
of Anheuser-Busch Companies.
   Anheuser-Busch's Spuds MacKenzie ads for Bud Lite beer were one
target of Koop's complaints about the industry.
   Koop did not draw a clear line between what action should be
imposed and what should be voluntary but said his proposals stress
voluntary compliance.
   Nonetheless, representatives of the alcoholic beverage industry
interpreted the broad program as an infringement.
   Koop adopted several proposals from scores presented in a report
by the December workshop. Among other recommendations he endorsed:
a decrease in the amount of blood alcohol content at which it is
illegal to drive from 0.10 percent to 0.04 percent by the year
2000, instant confiscation of drivers' licenses, anti-drunken
driving programs and funding of safety and health ads to match
alcohol ads.
   Forty percent of all deaths between the ages of 15 and 20 are
the result of motor vehicle accidents, and half of all crashes are
linked to alcohol abuse, according to federal statistics. Nearly
25,000 people died in alcohol-related traffic accidents in the
United States last year.
   Koop singled out the Spuds MacKenzie dog ads and Miller Lite's
beach party ads as promotions designed to appeal to young people,
who he said are more likely to die in a drunken driving accident
than from any other cause.
   Pointing to a display of the Bud and Miller ads, Koop said:
``These practices ... tell youth that alcohol consumption leads to
athletic, social and sexual success.''
   Lambright said Spuds MacKenzie has been used extensively to
promote responsible drinking.
   He said beer prices would double under Koop's proposals.
   In addition to the formal proposals, Koop also asked for an end
to ``happy hours'' and other price-cutting promotions.
   ``These actions may not make people as happy as happy hours do,
but they will help keep them alive,'' Koop said.

<TEXT>
   Jean Harris, killer of ``Scarsdale Diet Doctor''
Herman Tarnower, says she is remorseful about his death.
   ``Remorse has become an appendage to me,'' Ms. Harris told
Independent Network News in an interview this week at the Bedford
Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County.
   ``It's like another skin and I live in it and I always will,''
said Ms. Harris, 66.
   She said she feels ``terrible, terribly sorry. You don't throw
it off.''
   Ms. Harris said Tarnower could have prevented his death by
talking to her calmly when she confronted him about a love affair.
Instead, she said, he called her ``crazy'' and hit her in the face.
She then shot him to death.
   Ms. Harris was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison in March
1981. She has appealed twice to Gov. Mario Cuomo for clemency,
without success.
   The interview is scheduled to be broadcast tonight.

   At the Gathering Place bar, a special
honor goes to the Northwestern University student whose job
rejection letter is most like a swift kick in the seat of the pants.
   On Wednesday, with graduation approaching, it was time to select
a champion for the Class of 1989 and top honors went to student
David Whitlock, 22, who became ``Whitelock'' in a form letter
rejection from E &amp; J Gallo Winery.
   And the letter was dated Jan. 8, about a month before he was
interviewed.
   ``If I had gotten the letter when it was dated, I could have
avoided the interview process all together,'' he said.
   Other finalists included chemical engineering student Stanley
Russell _ or ``Stanely,'' as Texas Instruments Inc. called him in
its zinger.
   Russell, 22, said that when he sent in his resume, the bad news
came right back in a Mailgram.
   ``They wanted to reject me so fast they couldn't wait to use the
regular mail,'' he said.
   A half dozen times this spring, the Senior Class Gift Executive
Committee put together ``bullet nights,'' where students got a free
cup of beer if they submitted a rejection letter. The holder of the
most humiliating specimen of the evening won a pitcher of beer.
   Wednesday night's event in the bar in the student union pitted
this year's previous winners against each other.
   Bullet nights put a pinch of humor into the depressing business
of being turned down for a job, and gave the senior committee a
chance to put the touch on students for donations for the class
gift to the university.
   While some of the letters were embarrassing or insulting, others
were polite and straightforward.
   Russell said he got a nice rejection letter after being flown
down to Atlanta for a second interview.
   ``They try to make it sound like they're at fault for not having
something for someone of your amazing abilities,'' he said.
   ``They'll tell you they'll keep your resume on file,'' Russell
said. ``It's a nice way of saying, `When we get the cafeteria up
and running and we need a dishwasher, we'll call you.'''

   American military officials today called off their
search for 13 Marines and one sailor missing since a helicopter
crashed in the sea near Okinawa, and all were presumed dead, a
spokesman said.
   Seven Marines and a sailor were rescued after the CH-46 Sea
Knight, based at Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii, plunged into the sea late
Tuesday.
   The accident occurred shortly after the craft had taken off from
the USS Denver in an amphibious training exercise, said Master Sgt.
Jake Rodrigues, spokesman for U.S. Forces in Japan.
   He said the U.S. search was called off at 7:30 p.m.
   The chopper disappeared about midnight Tuesday 35 miles south of
Kadena Air Force Base on Okinawa. The cause of the crash was not
known.
   Four of the eight survivors were being treated for injuries at
Camp Lester Hospital in Okinawa and were ``stable and in good
condition,'' said Maj. Kerry Gershaneck, a spokesman for the Marine
Corps Air Station at Kaneohe Bay.
   He identified them as Lance Cpl. Keith A. Brower, 20, of Washoe
County, Nev.; Lance Cpl. Marvin T. Cook, 22, of Bonneville County,
Idaho; Cpl. George S. Sanchez, 20, of Denton County, Texas; and
Pfc. Jason S. Wiggins, 18, of Ouachita Parish, La.
   The other four were treated and returned to duty on the USS
Denver, a transport vessel designed for use in amphibious assaults
that can carry up to six CH-46 helicopters and a complement of
Marines, Gershaneck said.
   He identified them as Sgt. John R. Becker, 24, of St. Tammany
Parish, La.; Lance Cpl. David M. Fleming-Jones, 19, of Pierce
County, Wash.; Cpl. William R. West, 22, of Jefferson County,
Colo.; and Navy Hospitalman 3d Class J.K. Largent, 23, of
Barboursville County, W.Va.
   The Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station identified the missing
Marines and the sailor as:
   Capt. John J. Vela Jr., 27, of Humble, Texas; 1st Lt. Roger D.
Peters, 27, of Orinda, Calif.; 1st Lt. Martin C. Rawley, 24, of
Kirkland, Wash.; Sgt. David A. Woomer, 25, of West Chicago, Ill.;
Lance Cpl. Michael T. Bogucki, 23, of Burr Oak, Mich.; Lance Cpl.
Raymond L. Dallimore, 20, of Reno, Nev.; Lance Cpl. Jeffrey S.
Fulton, 22, of Brinnon, Wash.; Lance Cpl. John C. Graves Jr., 21,
of Pasadena, Texas; Lance Cpl. Charles E. McCadd, 20, of Chicago.;
Lance Cpl. Ronald D. North, 20, of St. Petersburg, Fla.; Cpl. Paul
J. Barker, 24, of Shelton, Wash.; Cpl. Carter W. Collings, 21, of
Covina, Calif.; Cpl. Patrick A. Poe, 23, of Little Rock, Ark. and
Navy Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Tim Renaldo, 25, of Huntington
Beach, Calif.
   Rodrigues said the helicopter carried a crew of four and 18
Marines who were assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine
Regiment, Okinawa, for six months of training.

<DATELINE>GALLATIN, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury has found the son of a former
funeral director guilty of larceny for his role in helping bury a
body without a casket.
   Gary Wilks, 31, faces additional charges in a burial scandal in
which authorities found more than two dozen bodies buried without
caskets and vaults in Kentucky and Tennessee.
   Wilks was convicted Wednesday in Sumner County Court of larceny
by false pretenses in the burial of a man in 1988 without a vault
and casket paid for by the man's family. A vault is a metal or
concrete enclosure in the ground into which the casket is lowered
at burial.
   Wilks' father, Bobby, 53, director of the Barber Funeral Home in
Robertson County, pleaded guilty in Sumner County Court on May 17
to two counts of grand larceny by false pretenses in connection
with two other burials.
   The elder Wilks, who faces a maximum prison term of 12 years in
the Sumner County case, will enter pleas next week on 71 counts of
burial fraud in Robertson County.
   Gary Wilks, who faces two additional charges in Robertson County
in connection with improper burials there, will be sentenced July
14 on the Sumner County charge. He faces three to six years in
prison.
   Prosecutors described Gary Wilks as an apprentice funeral
director at his father's funeral home.
   Defense attorney Terry McNabb, who presented no witnesses,
argued that his client was being railroaded toward a conviction
because he is Bobby Wilks' son.

<DATELINE>CHANGAMBIKA, Malawi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renewed fighting in neighboring
Mozambique's civil war has led about 20,000 people to seek refuge
in already crowded camps in Malawi, officials say.
   Local authorities say the latest exodus raises to 652,000 the
number of refugees now in Malawi, a poor nation of 8 million people.
   Fighting between troops of the Marxist government and right-wing
rebels in Mozambique's 12-year civil war has intensified in the
past month, said Fletcher Zenengeya, a top official in President
Hasting Kamuzu Banda's office.
   ``We are very worried,'' he said. ``We thought the situation in
Mozambique had stabilized.''
   At least 1,800 Mozambicans recently fled to an isolated camp in
Changambika, near the western border, that already houses 9,000
people.
   Some of the arrivals said rebels of the Mozambique National
Resistance, or Renamo, stormed the government-occupied settlements
of Kapirizanja and Ntsakama in Tete province late last month.
   Government troops fired a few shots before fleeing into the
bush, pursued by the guerrillas, the refugees said.
   They said Zimbabwean troops based in Mozambique to guard
transport links helped recapture the settlements but most civilians
fled.
   ``Rebels looted our possessions and crops,'' said Gera Jazi, who
lived in Kapirizanja. ``Many houses were burned to the ground. Some
women, including my own daughter, were kidnapped to be used as
porters and wives by the rebels.''
   Relief officials said that after new fighting at Villa Nova and
Mutarara farther south in Mozambique's Zambezia province a week ago
about 500 refugees fled to camps in Malawi.
   Relief officals, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
believed government troops faced increasing difficulties defending
remote rural settlements.
   The Malawi government, worried about crowding in camps, has
begun transporting new refugees to less populated areas. In Nsanje,
where vegetation has been stripped to build tens of thousands of
shelters, Mozambicans outnumber Malawians 3-to-2.
   Patrick De Souza of the U.N. High Commission For Refugees said
food supplies were low.
   ``We had made contingency plans for the new influx, but the
problem is that our supply pipeline is not functioning,'' he said.
``The groundnuts, maize and beans that donors promised have not
arrived in time.''
   No groundnuts, one of the main sources of protein for refugees,
have been delivered since December.
   ``As a result, malnutrition is now our biggest problem,'' said
Dr. Alice Brodel, head of the French relief organization Doctors
Without Borders.

<TEXT>
   The government has dropped plans to build a
$500 million annex to the Pentagon, according to Defense Department
officials.
   ``There is no current planning being considered on the Pentagon
annex,'' said Kenneth H. Evans, a member of a Defense Department
group being formed to oversee planning for the department's
facilities in the Washington area. Plans for an annex ``are being
held in abeyance,'' he said.
   Instead, the department plans to concentrate on renovating the
Pentagon, expanding Army facilities at Fort Belvoir, Va., and
consolidating and possibly relocating Navy offices currently in the
Crystal City section of Arlington, Va., he said.
   Evans spoke Wednesday to a group of local, regional and federal
officials at a meeting to review federal building projects in the
Washington area.
   After the meeting Evans declined to comment on whether budget
constraints or political opposition had helped scuttle plans for
the annex.
   Plans originally called for a 3-million-square-foot facility on
the Pentagon's south parking lot. The proposal met with strong
opposition from Arlington officials who said the county does not
have the road or utility infrastructure to support a complex of
that size. The Pentagon has about 3.7 million square feet of office
space.
   The size of the proposed annex was scaled back last year, to
about 1.8 million square feet. At that time officials said a study
of Defense Department needs was being considered by Congress. But a
master plan on the annex was proceeding.
   Now, even the master plan has been dropped. ``We are restudying
Pentagon development,'' said Linda Eastman, chief facilities
planner for the General Services Administration's national capital
region office.

<HEAD>Rescued Chick Returned To Downtown Nest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state biologist rappelled down a
23-story downtown office building in the early morning fog today to
return a peregrine falcon chick to its nest on a narrow ledge.
   Thomas French, director of the state's endangered species
program, rescued the chick last week after viewers of a local cable
television company, which has kept a camera on the nest
24-hours-a-day, called to say the chick was having trouble
breathing.
   French said a tendon from a piece of meat had become tangled
around the chick's tongue and the chick was near death. It swiftly
recovered after the meat was dislodged by veterinarians at Tufts
Veterinary School, and had doubled its weight during its eight days
of treatment.
   As French perched on the narrow ledge on the 21st floor, with
the struggling chick in his hands, the mother falcon continually
dove at his helmet, at one point dislodging it. The helmet dropped
to the ledge and French quickly grabbed it, but his eyeglasses
ended up on the street hundreds of feet below.
   ``She's a fierce wild bird,'' French said. ``And she was just
trying to protect her nest.''
   The 2{-week-old chicks were the first of the endangered
predators to be hatched in western Massachusetts in more than 40
years.

   A deputy in the new Soviet parliament today gave a
scathing review of the nation's agricultural system and said the
Poliburo member in charge of the vast network of state-run farms is
incompetent.
   It was the latest in a series of contentious speeches during the
inaugural session of the Congress of People's Deputies, and this
time Yegor K. Ligachev was on the receiving end.
   ``How could this happen?'' deputy Yuri D. Chernichenko asked of
Ligachev's appointment to head the Communist Party commission for
agriculture. The commission was created last year to marshal
official efforts to curtail chronic food shortages.
   Heads swiveled in the 2,250-member Congress toward where
Ligachev was sitting with other Politburo members, but the
white-haired Siberian sat impassively.
   Also today, Congress formed a commission to determine whether
the Kremlin absorbed the three Baltic republics by force.
   Decades of official Soviet doctrine maintain that the republics
_ Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania _ voluntarily joined the Soviet
Union in 1940, ending their existence as independent nations. But
secret protocols to the 1939 German-Soviet non-aggression pact
deeded control of the Baltic area to the Kremlin, and Soviet troops
moved in the next year.
   Chernichenko, a Moscow-based television broadcaster who
specializes in agriculture and rural life, ridiculed the
performance of the vast state-run farm sector, saying: ``How can it
be explained ... that the economy that produces five times more
tractors and 10 times more combine harvesters than the United
States produces only half as much bread?''
   Ligachev, as a member of the ruling Poliburo, would once have
been immune to such criticism from a parliamentarian.
Chernichenko's sarcastic swipes at him were in keeping with the
unprecedented tone of the congressional session, which began last
week.
   On Wednesday, Communist Party maverick Boris N. Yeltsin said
Soviets are worse off now than they were before President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reforms, and he held Gorbachev responsible.
   The same day, the president of the Latvian republic, Anatoly
Gorbunov, proposed making the 15 Soviet republics sovereign states
in charge of their own resources and laws.
   Also Wednesday, deputy Yuri Vlasov, who won a weightlifting gold
medal in the 1960 Olympics, assailed the KGB secret police and
criticized Gorbachev's handling of ethnic unrest in Soviet Georgia.
   Such remarks were never heard in the old parliament, the Supreme
Soviet.
   Chernichenko repeated a question to the Congress he said voters
had asked at campaign appearances leading up to the March election:
   ``Why is this politically significant branch, the branch which
determines the future, ruled by a person who does not understand
anything about it and who failed in the field of ideology?''
   Ligachev became head of the agriculture commission after being
relieved of the ideology portfolio, the position that once made him
the No. 2 Kremlin leader.
   Ligachev noted last year that there was plenty to eat in the
Siberian region of Tomsk when he served there as party chief in
1965-83, but nothing in his background marks him as a specialist on
farming.
   He studied at an institute of aircraft building.
   In the past year, Ligachev and Gorbachev have placed different
emphasis on what must be done to ease shortages of meat, fruit,
vegetables and other foodstuffs. Gorbachev has promoted leasing of
state-held land to individuals as the chief way to increase farm
output.
   But Ligachev has said the giant state and collective farms, onto
which millions of peasants were herded during Josef Stalin's rule,
are the backbone of Soviet agriculture.
   Neither approach scored a clear victory when the party's Central
Committee decreed a set of agricultural reforms in March. The
policy-making body approved the leasing of farmland to peasants for
as long as 50 years, but also maintained state and collective farms.
   Asked about Chernichenko's remarks, Politburo member Lev N.
Zaikov, the Moscow party chief, told reporters: ``You can't just
take the podium, not knowing a person, and say such things.''
   Another Politburo member, Vadim A. Medvedev, said the party had
taken action to fix the problems with farms Chernichenko cited, but
he acknowledged: ``The farm problems are indeed very serious and
they give rise to stormy emotions and statements.''
   Medvedev told reporters Ligachev was unfairly singled out for
criticism because ``all members of the Politburo more or less take
on responsibilities for all questions. We all answer for
everything.''
   The inaugural session of the Congress was to have ended
Wednesday, but it appeared the open forum would last another week
unless presiding officers cut off debate.
   Gorbachev announced to the Congress late Wednesday that 469
deputies had signed up to speak; just 250 were heard in the first
six days of debate, which have been televised live to the nation.
   Gorbachev diplomatically suggested the time allotted each
speaker be cut by five minutes, to 10 minutes. Deputies responded
with a joint ``Nyet!''

   Undercover police officers in unmarked
cars are going to be out on the prowl for traffic law violators _
police who speed.
   Sheriff Jim McMillan says he has received complaints about
officers speeding when there's no need.
   McMillan said officers caught speeding or violating other
traffic laws will have to have a good explanation or face
disciplinary action.
   Chief John Gordon of the patrol and traffic division said the
program has been used periodically over the past 10 years.
   ``We know police cars speed. If you're lying on the street
bleeding and waiting for an officer, you would want the officer to
speed,'' Gordon said. But he acknowledged that some speeding is
done without need.
   McMillan said he's after those who speed while on routine patrol.
   Gordon said offending officers will not get traffic citations,
but the discipline they receive may be more severe than a fine.

   Linda S. Wilson, a chemist and vice
president for research at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor,
has been named the seventh president of Radcliffe College.
   Ms. Wilson, 52, takes over from Matina Horner, who steps down at
the end of this month after 17 years as president. Horner, 49, a
research psychologist, said she will take a sabbatical before
deciding what to do next.
   Ms. Wilson said she plans to concentrate on improving
undergraduate life, stressing the school's role in public policy
and focusing on its research.
   ``My challenge will be to develop effective strategies to
multiply (Radcliffe's) impact and to sustain its deep meaning for
the lives of women,'' Ms. Wilson said at a news conference
Wednesday.
   She offered no specifics when asked how she would make Radcliffe
stand apart from Harvard. Radcliff, a women's college, was founded
in 1879 as an annex of Harvard College but has moved in to become
half of Harvard.
   The two colleges' admissions offices merged in 1975. In 1988,
women comprised 41 percent of Harvard's 6,525 undergraduates.
   Before taking her position at the University of Michigan in
1985, Ms. Wilson was an administrator at the University of Illinois
in Champaign-Urbana.
   She was on the faculty at the University of Maryland and the
University of Missouri-St. Louis and has been a consultant to an
advisory panel to the National Institutes of Health and served as
an adviser to the National Science Foundation.

<HEAD>Eds: Cockrell swearing-in to occur during meeting that begins at
2 p.m. EDT. No PMs lead planned.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Henry Cisneros quietly leaves City Hall
today after eight years, and admirers say that despite personal
problems that led him not to seek re-election, he won't stay in
private life forever.
   ``One way or another, he'll be back,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas. ``And we'll be the better for it.''
   Cisneros, 41, declined to seek a fifth two-year term after being
beset by highly publicized marital problems and the illness of his
son, now nearly 2. He plans to join a financial company in San
Antonio.
   ``I don't expect to try to remain a force in city government or
city politics,'' Cisneros said. ``I don't think you can be halfway
in or halfway out. You're either in or you're out, and I'm going on
to other things.''
   Cisneros cleaned out his office Wednesday, and his successor,
Lila Cockrell, was to be sworn in during an afternoon city council
meeting.
   The Ivy League-educated Cisneros has been one of the nation's
most visible Hispanic leaders and was at one time mentioned as a
potential Democratic vice presidential candidate in 1984.
   During his eight years as mayor, his city has grown to a
population of more than 900,000, making it the ninth largest in the
United States.
   Cisneros' latest victory as mayor was voter approval in January
of a public transportation tax to fund construction of the
Alamodome stadium, which he strongly supported. He has also been
credited with boosting tourism and helping bridge the gap between
the white business establishment and poor Hispanics.
   Though he has ruled out any early run for another office,
Cisneros has left his options open for the long run. In an
interview last fall after he announced he would not seek
re-election, he said he would concentrate on ``reading, reflecting
and writing'' in order to develop ``new and better ways to build
the future.''
   He said that at heart he is ``a public service-oriented person.''
   More recently, he said that he has ``no plan, no timetable, no
deadline, no office in mind'' for his political future.
   Cisneros' successor, Ms. Cockrell, was also his predecessor. She
served as mayor from 1975 to 1981 before deciding not to seek
another term. Now 67, she was elected to the mayor's office again
last month, beating six other candidates.

<HEAD>Jim Wright III Attacks Gingrich As `Another Joe McCarthy'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright's son today called
Rep. Newt Gingrich, who started the investigation of his father,
``another Joe McCarthy'' and said the speaker was the victim of the
``reactionary right.''
   Jim Wright III, interviewed from Santa Fe, N.M., on NBC-TV's
``Today'' show, at first said he would not name anyone in his
criticism of a House investigation that led to his father's
announcement Wednesday to resign.
   But, later in the interview, he referred to House Minority Whip
Gingrich, R-Ga., who initiated the investigation of Wright before
he joined the GOP House leadership.
   ``I think the Republicans are going to realize that he's just a
loose cannon on the deck, another Joe McCarthy,'' said Wright, 44,
who is a personnel administrator with the State of New Mexico. He
said he agreed with his father, however, that ``mindless
cannibalism'' should end and Democrats should not go after Gingrich.
   ``As soon as he becomes an embarrassment to them (Republicans),
they'll back away from him and let him sink on his own,'' the
younger Wright said.
   The speaker's son said he was giving his opinion, not his
father's, when he compared Gingrich with the late Sen. Joseph
McCarthy, who led efforts to expose people McCarthy labled as
communists in government and private industry.
   ``I feel that the reactionary right has pulled a page out of Joe
McCarthy's book, to use a tactic against my father called the big
lie; tell a lie about somebody over and over long enough and not
let him defned himself and you're bound to get him,'' said Wright.
   ``I think he's been black-listed for being an effective opponent
of the reactionary right,'' he said.

<HEAD>ACLU Challenges Town's Anti-Sleeping Ordinance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union said
today it has asked a federal court to overturn a resort community's
ordinance prohibiting sleeping overnight in cars or on the beach.
   ``I liken it to a Southern speed trap. These people come into
town and innocently get caught doing something they didn't know was
illegal,'' said Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU's
Rhode Island chapter.
   ``Vagrancy ordinances have routinely been struck down by the
courts as unconstitutional,'' he added.
   He said the lawsuit challenging the ordinance in Westerly was
filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of two Connecticut men who
were arrested last year, one for sleeping in his car at a beach
parking lot. The men paid the $20 fine to avoid a weekend in jail
and then complained to the ACLU, Brown said.
   The ACLU has received complaints over the years about the
ordinance, but an influx of complaints last year made the
organization decide to challenge the law, he said.
   Many of those arrested are young people who come to the beaches
for the day and cannot find motel rooms, so they choose to rest
before driving home, he said.
   ``These people are actually being safety conscious,'' he said.
   Westerly Police Chief Mark S. Champlin said about 300 people
were arrested during the summer for violating the ordinance.
   ``It certainly curbs our problems with break-ins and
vandalism,'' Champlin said. ``If we didn`t have the ordinance I`m
sure we would have chaos in the beach area.''
   ``I think it's a very strange assertion that waking people up
from sleep at 3 o'clock in the morning is a way to protect the town
from chaos,'' Brown said. ``This has nothing to do with protecting
order. It has to do with harassing tourists that get caught up in
this trap.''
   Town Solicitor Maureen Goldberg was not available for comment,
and no one else could say how long the ordinance had been on the
books, a secretary said.
   The ACLU challenged the ordinance as overbroad and vague and
said it improperly criminalized innocent conduct and was aimed at
out-of-state tourists.
   The ordinance prohibits sleeping in cars or outdoors anywhere at
night, including private property, except for people using trailers
at licensed campgrounds.

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's civil war will be prolonged
if the United States supplies arms to non-communist guerrillas in
the nation, Vietnam's state radio said today.
   A report in The New York Times on Wednesday said President Bush
is seeking congressional support for a covert program to provide
weapons to non-communist rebels fighting the Vietnamese-backed
government in Cambodia.
   ``This only stimulates a civil war ... prolongs the dispute and
runs counter to the common trend for an early peaceful settlement
to the Cambodian issue,'' Voice of Vietnam radio said.
   The radio said such a plan would go against agreements reached
during informal peace talks held in Indonesia between resistance
leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Premier Hun Sen of Cambodia.
   The Cambodian resistance is made up of Prince Sihanouk's forces,
the Khmer People's National Liberation Front and the communist
Khmer Rouge.
   Led by Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge ran Cambodia from 1975 through
1978, during which 1 million Cambodians died.
   The government was ousted by the Vietnamese invasion, but the
Khmer Rouge remains the strongest resistance faction with about
30,000 troops, according to U.S. Embassy estimates.
   Vietnam still maintains a military force in Cambodia but has
promised to withdraw all of its troops by Sept. 30.
   The Times quoted an unidentified State Department official as
saying arms supplies would help the non-communist forces hold their
own if the Khmer Rouge tried to seize control of Cambodia in the
future. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher on Wednesday
would neither confirm nor deny the report.
   He said in Washington that ``appropriate assistance'' would
strengthen the non-communist resistance and ``enhance its position
and that of Prince Sihanouk'' in his efforts to oust the
Vietnamese-backed government.
   The Bush administration was ``unalterably opposed'' to a return
to power by the Khmer Rouge, he said.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, recently wrote to Bush opposing lethal aid to
Sihanouk on the ground that it might fall into the hands of the
Khmer Rouge.
   China is the major supplier of weapons to all three resistance
groups.
   France will host an international conference on the future of
Cambodia in early August, a few weeks before Vietnam is scheduled
to withdraw its troops.

   Guy Sherman Paschal, a prolific inventor who
developed the Airwick air freshener and produced a wide variety of
other products, has died at the age of 87.
   He died of a stroke Sunday night at his home in Oneco.
   Paschal founded AirKem Co. in 1940 to market the Airwick product
developed primarily in his New York City basement as an industrial
disinfectant.
   ``We knew something was going on in the basement. We didn't know
quite what,'' said his son, Guy Paschal, of Purchase, N.Y.
   Paschal was president of the company until he moved to Florida
in 1943 and remained vice president for research and development
until 1951. The right to produce Airwick was franchised in the
early 1960s, and its products now are marketed by Airwick
Industries of Carlstadt, N.J.
   Paschal also developed a three-dimensional chess game
distributed by the Red Cross to military hospitals, an automatic
hen feeder for laying cages, a full line of food flavorings, a
low-calorie sweetener, an oven cleaner and a portable toilet, among
other things.
   He wrote a column for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune from 1961 to
1973 and hosted television and radio talk shows.
   He was survived by his wife, Melanie, a son, daughter, 10
grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Foley Hopes Congress Will Return to National Issues</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 2-4, with Wright quotes.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley said
today he hoped Congress could turn to national issues and a mood of
conciliation now that Speaker Jim Wright has announced his
resignation.
   And Wright said he was looking forward to ``a more tranquil
existence'' after Congress, doing some writing and some speaking.
   ``I will get to do a lot of things I enjoy in life and have been
postponing _ to read, reflect and be with friends in a leisurely
setting,'' said Wright, after opening today's House session. ``I
feel liberated,'' said the speaker, who endured a year under
scrutiny for alleged ethical violations.
   Foley, who is expected to be elected to replace Wright as
speaker next Tuesday, said, ``We need to return to a mood of mutual
respect and conciliation between the parties. I think that's the
overwhelming desire of the leadership on both sides of the aisle.''
   ``I believe we can do that. And in doing so, we can return the
focus of our deliberations to those national issues that ... the
public elected the Congress'' to resolve, he said.
   Democrats were moving to install the new speaker quickly, hoping
to limit the political damage from the ethics controversy that
culminated with Wright's resignation speech on Wednesday.
   But while President Bush issued a statement yesterday praising
Wright's ``effectiveness and dedication,'' congressional
Republicans weren't ready to let go of the ethics issue so fast.
   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, chairman of the GOP campaign committee,
said Wright believed he had done no wrong. But, he added, the
speaker behaved out of a ``thought pattern'' of ``self interest
rather than the public interest.''
   Wright's resignation speech was filled with detailed denials of
the House ethics committee charges against him and punctuated with
a plea to Democrats not to try and exact revenge on Republicans for
his political demise.
   ``All of us in both parties must resolve to bring this period of
mindless cannibalism to an end,'' said the man who initially
laughed off the complaint that triggered the ethics committee
investigation. ``There's been enough of it.''
   Wright mopped his forehead repeatedly and his hands shook at
times as he delivered his self-defense to a packed chamber and a
national television audience.
   The ethics committee investigation of the speaker, which led six
weeks ago to charges that he violated House rules of conduct in 69
instances, has overshadowed and interfered with the business of
legislation.
   Every time he wanted to talk about national priorities, Wright
said, the news media ``wanted to ask me about petty personal
finances.''
   ``You do not need that for a speaker. You need somebody else,''
he said, announcing the end to his tenure.
   Despite Foley's assured ascension to speaker, Wright's
resignation comes at a tumultuous time for Democrats. Democratic
Whip Tony Coelho of California has also announced plans to resign,
saying he didn't want to endure an ethics investigation like
Wright's.
   Coelho acknowledged recently that a savings and loan officer set
him up with a junk bond buy, and that he failed to properly report
a $50,000 loan toward that purchase from the officer's financial
institution.
   In addition, Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania, the No. 4 leader
in the party hierarchy, has complained to Justice Department
officials about leaks to reporters that his office is the subject
of a separate probe.
   The Democrats scheduled a party caucus next Tuesday to nominate
Foley, and the full House is likely to ratify the choice within
hours. The speaker said by the end of June he also would give up
his seat representing the 12th district of Texas.
   Never before has a House speaker resigned under fire in
mid-term. Wright's Democratic colleagues, some of whom had
privately told reporters they thought he had stayed too long,
hailed it as an heroic sacrifice for the institution and called on
Republicans to take heed.
   ``Jim Wright committed a selfless act,'' said Rep. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., who helped defend the speaker before the House
ethics committee. ``His parting gift to this institution was a
warning ... (to) stop looking for retribution and vengeance and
simply get on with the nation's work.''
   ``I felt it was almost like Hamlet, a prince on his knees and a
very strong effective speaker we're not going to have any more,''
said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.
   The investigation of Wright was begun a year ago based on a
complaint by Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who was rewarded by his GOP
colleagues earlier this year when they installed him as the House
Minority Whip.
   Gingrich, who himself is now the target of an ethics complaint,
avoided reporters after Wright's speech. But other leading
Republicans made clear they wanted to take advantage of the
Democrats' loss.
   Vander Jagt of Michigan said the Democrats were corrupt from too
many years in power in the House. He said the GOP would pressure
Democrats to change campaign laws to weaken the advantages of
incumbency, which favors the majority Democrats.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., was considered the favorite to
replace Foley as Majority Leader. Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., was
battling Gephardt for that job.
   Four prominent Democrats were working their House precinct for
Coelho's No. 3 spot.
   Contending against Gray were Rep. David Bonior of Michigan,
currently the Chief Deputy Whip, Rep. Beryl Anthony, chairman of
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Rep. Henry
Waxman, a powerful member of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee.
   It also was unclear how the House ethics committee would wind
down its probe of the speaker. Once Wright leaves the House, it
will no longer have jurisdiction over the speaker, and the
committee is not expected to meet again until next week.
   Pending before the panel is Wright's motion to dismiss the
central charges against him: that he accepted ``gifts'' from a
developer friend, including a no-work job for his wife, Betty, when
that developer had an interest in legislation, and that he used

   The Senate rejected an attempt today to
provide more money to increase federal prison space for drug
offenders as lawmkers debated a $3.3 billion domestic spending bill
and edged toward a confrontation with the House.
   On a 77-18 vote, the Senate turned down an amendment that would
have shifted $70 million from the Defense Department's drug
interdiction programs to monies used to increase space in federal
prisons.
   ``Prisons are in a deplorable condition today,'' said Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., who argued that the Pentagon was not going to spend
the money.
   But he was overcome by opponents who argued that the Defense
Department in fact planned to use the funds.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee gave unanimous approval
Wednesday to the overall measure, which includes $1.2 billion for
an assortment of veterans programs that are running short of funds,
including health care and cost-of-living increases in benefits.
   At the same time, the panel decided to remove $822 million that
the House had inserted for extra law enforcement agents, more
prisons, expanded counseling programs and a host of other efforts
aimed at illegal drug trafficking.
   The panel also rebuffed Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who
proposed an amendment to provided $228 million for anti-drug
initiatives by transferring the money from Pentagon accounts.
   ``We told the American people we were going to be serious,''
DeConcini said of recent measures laying out federal drug
strategies without paying fully for them. ``We're a long way from
meeting that commitment.''
   But the panel voted against DeConcini 24-5, bowing to arguments
that President Bush might veto the bill if it included the
anti-drug funds.
   ``I don't want to see the committee do something here that puts
this bill in jeopardy,'' committee Chairman Robert Byrd told his
colleagues. Byrd had a private reason to avoid a veto.
   The Senate committee's bill includes $75 million for a 300-foot
radiotelescope that collapsed last November in his home state of
West Virginia. It also contains $6.6 million in subsidies for
airlines serving small communities, a provision favored both by
Byrd and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine.
   The bill includes $7.3 million for federal cleanup efforts in
Prince William Sound, Alaska, and orders the government to bill
Exxon for Coast Guard expenses in dealing with the March oil spill.
Both measures reflect membership on the appropriations panel of
Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska.
   When the House passed its version of the bill on a party-line
227-197 vote last Wednesday, GOP lawmakers supported Bush
administration arguments that the drug spending would boost this
year's deficit and could wait until 1990. Democrats reveled in
forcing Republicans to vote against tougher efforts against drugs.
   Like the House measure, the Senate bill provides $892 million
for the Guaranteed Student Loan program for college students; $423
million for state foster care programs; $342 million for the costs
of battling last summer's forest fires; $125 million for United
Nations peacekeeping operations; and $100 million for refugees from
the Soviet Union and elsewhere.
   Besides removing the anti-drug spending, the Senate measure
makes several other changes in the House legislation.
   It provides $225 million for the food stamp program, which has
had a heavier than expected caseload this year. The House bill
included no money for the program.
   It drops $127 million the House provided to $91 million for
workers whose jobs are lost because of foreign competition; reduces
the House's $88 million to $8.2 million for public housing
assistance; and removes $15 million the House provided for aid to
the homeless.
   The Senate measure provides $19 million, not financed by the
House, for the costs of keeping a weather satellite aloft.
   The Senate bill also eliminate a House provision allowing the
brewers of Rolling Rock beer a temporary exemption from a law
requiring a warning label on alcoholic beverage containers. The
beer is made in glass bottles with painted labels, and its producer
says it will take time to retool the labeling machines.

<HEAD>Government Drops Plans to Build Annex to Pentagon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has dropped plans to build a
$500 million annex to the Pentagon, according to Defense Department
officials.
   ``There is no current planning being considered on the Pentagon
annex,'' said Kenneth H. Evans, a member of a Defense Department
group being formed to oversee planning for the department's
facilities in the Washington area. Plans for an annex ``are being
held in abeyance,'' he said.
   Instead, the department plans to concentrate on renovating the
Pentagon, expanding Army facilities at Fort Belvoir, Va., and
consolidating and possibly relocating Navy offices currently in the
Crystal City section of Arlington, Va., he said.
   Evans spoke Wednesday to a group of local, regional and federal
officials at a meeting to review federal building projects in the
Washington area.
   After the meeting Evans declined to comment on whether budget
constraints or political opposition had helped scuttle plans for
the annex.
   Plans originally called for a 3-million-square-foot facility on
the Pentagon's south parking lot. The proposal met with strong
opposition from Arlington officials who said the county does not
have the road or utility infrastructure to support a complex of
that size. The Pentagon has about 3.7 million square feet of office
space.
   The size of the proposed annex was scaled back last year, to
about 1.8 million square feet. At that time officials said a study
of Defense Department needs was being considered by Congress. But a
master plan on the annex was proceeding.
   Now, even the master plan has been dropped. ``We are restudying
Pentagon development,'' said Linda Eastman, chief facilities
planner for the General Services Administration's national capital
region office.

<HEAD>Premier Urges Parliament to Absolve Hungary's Executed Uprising Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The premier today urged Parliament to
consider declaring former government leader Imre Nagy and others
executed for their role in a 1956 anti-Soviet uprising innocent of
all wrongdoing.
   Also today, Parliament voted to abolish the death penalty for
political crimes and lifted constraints on the ownership of private
property.
   Nagy, premier in 1956, was executed in 1958 after being
convicted of anti-state crimes. But Premier Miklos Nemeth today
told Parliament the Nagy trial was not entirely based on legal
considerations.
   ``I suggest to Parliament that it consider a law that states the
innocence'' of Nagy and other uprising leaders, Nemeth said.
   His comments were the latest in the de facto rehabilitation of
Nagy by the Communist Party. Nemeth said the government would issue
its official position on the trial before June 16, the 31st
anniversary of Nagy's execution.
   In an appeal partly directed at the Soviet Union, Nemeth urged
other communist nations to help Hungary review the revolt.
   ``The political concepts forming the basis for the judgment
developed not only in Hungary,'' Nemeth said, seeming to suggest
the political climate at the time reflected the overall situation
in the Soviet bloc.
   Nemeth also appealed for calm on the June 16 anniversary, when
the remains of Nagy and other executed revolutionary figures _
exhumed from unmarked mass graves _ will be reburied.
   ``Let June 16 be a day of mourning and remembrance, and it's up
to us whether we look back on it as a day of national
reconciliation,'' he said. ``It's up to us that the era that began
with the 1956 national tragedy does not end with a national
tragedy.''
   Also today, Parliament passed laws permitting unlimited
purchases of property by individuals, after decades of constraints
on private ownership.
   There was only one abstention in today's vote by the 380-member
Parliament that abolished the death penalty. Justice Minister
Kalman Kulcsar invoked the memory of Nagy during the discussion
that occurred before the vote.
   The death penalty vote came just one day after the communist
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party described Nagy as ``a
significant figure of Hungarian post-1945 history.'' In a
statement, the party described those who died in the fighting as
``a loss to the nation.''
   Until early this year, the revolt _ the bloodiest within the
Soviet bloc _ was officially described as a counterrevolution. In
February, the Communist Party partially revised its view,
acknowledging that it began as a popular uprising. A statement
Wednesday, drafted by the Central Committee, said many on both
sides ``fought heroically and died for causes they believed just.''

<HEAD>Cavazos Unveils Crackdown On Schools Who Allow Loan Defaults</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with material from press conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos today
unveiled strict new regulations designed to crack down on schools
that are turning out large numbers of delinquent borrowers and
contributing to a rising burden for taxpayers.
   Under the rules, schools with default rates above 60 percent
will be subject to limitation, suspension or termination from the
government's massive student loan program starting Jan. 1, 1991.
Currently nearly 200 schools fit in the category.
   Schools with 40 percent to 60 percent of their students failing
to pay back loans _ now numbering 450 _ must reduce the figure by 5
percent a year or face the same penalties.
   The new system also prescribes increasingly strict steps for the
more than 1,000 schools with 20 percent to 30 percent default
rates. And all vocational schools, regardless of their default
rates, must provide information on completion and job placement
rates to all prospective students.
   Vocational schools are considered prime offenders in the default
problem which is expected to cost taxpayers $1.8 billion this year.
They have an average 40 percent default rate compared to 20 percent
for community colleges and 10 percent for other sectors.
   ``We must weed out unethical schools and other program
participants whose sole purpose is to profit at the expense of our
students and taxpayers,'' said Cavazos. ``Today, we are taking
decisive action against those who cheat our citizens, those who
promise to educate but deliver only a debt.''
   Cavazos said it was never intended that 37 cents out of every
dollar spent on the student loan program would go to cover
defaulted loans.
   Other new rules will require that all schools provide entrance
counseling to first-time borrowers; schools with default rates
above 20 percent develop default management plans, and schools with
default rates above 30 percent delay dispersing loans to first-time
borrowers until 30 days after the first day of class and prorate
tuition refunds to borrowers who drop out before the course is
completed.
   The new rules, to be published this week in the Federal
Register, are final. The department is proposing a further
requirement that all private vocational schools arrange for another
school to complete their courses if they close in mid-semester.
   A package of proposals submitted to Congress asks lawmakers to
require that students without a high school diploma or the
equivalent pass a test before being allowed to enroll. Other
legislative proposals would require pro-rated tuition refunds for
students at schools with default rates over 30 percent and
authorize guaranty agencies to garnish the wages of defaulters up
to 10 percent of disposable earnings.
   In addition, the department is taking several administrative
steps to strengthen enforcement, including increased reviews,
audits and investigations and expanded fraud detection through a
toll-free hotline. Collection efforts are expected to total $630
million, a 27 percent increase over last year.
   Some 4.6 million students are expected to borrow money under the
student loan program in fiscal 1989. The program is projected to
cost $5 billion this year in subsidies and default payments.
   According to a list issued by the Education Department, the 10
schools with the nation's worst default problems are the Sawyer
School of Business, Center Line, Mich., 93.8 percent; Kalamazoo
Beauty Academy, Kalamazoo, Mich., 89.5 percent; Cambridge Business
College, Detroit, 86 percent; Payne-Pulliam School of Trade,
Detroit, 85.5 percent; Chicago School of Automatic Transmission,
84.7 percent; Odessa's College of Beauty, Gary, Ind., 83.8 percent;
Maryland Institute of Technology, Baltimore, 83.3 percent; Midsouth
School of Beauty, Memphis, 82.9 percent; Jerome's School of Beauty
Culture, New Orleans, 82.2 percent; Americo Technical Careers, New
Orleans, 81.8 percent.

<TEXT>
   Authorities said today they have
made little progress in their investigation of the bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 and they have found no proof the bomb was planted in
Frankfurt.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. reported on Wednesday that
Scottish police are convinced the bomb was smuggled aboard at
Frankfurt Airport, where Pan Am Flight 103 originated. The New
York-bound flight changed to a Boeing 747 in London and blew up
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on aboard and 11
on the ground.
   Jochen Schroers, spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's
office, which is heading the West German investigation, said
authorities had no evidence to back the BBC report or other similar
claims. ``We cannot confirm this,'' he said.
   Asked if West German authorities had made any progress in their
probe of the Dec. 21 bombing, Schroers said: ``Unfortunately,
that's not the case.''
   Police in Lockerbie, meanwhile, said their investigation was
moving ahead.
   ``I am hopeful and optimistic for a reasonable conclusion,''
said constable John Boyd. He did not elaborate.
   The West German magazine Stern reported last week that a
suspected bomb maker for the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command was released from West German custody
because he was working for the country's intelligence service. The
Syrian-supported group has been mentioned as a prime suspect in the
Pan Am bombing.
   West German authorities have denied that the man, identified by
Stern as Marwan Khreesat, worked in intelligence.
   Schroers said investigators ``haven't the slightest indication
that he was linked to Lockerbie.''
   Khreesat was among a group of 17 suspected Popular Front
terrorists arrested in West Germany in October. Two remain in
custody.
   Khreesat and the others were released shortly after the arrests
for lack of evidence, officials have said.

<TEXT>
   A couple were arrested and charged
with murder for allegedly forcing their infant son to drink
sulfuric acid, and then claiming he was the victim of contaminated
baby formula.
   Shelia Smith, 26, and Ricky Irby Sr., 29, both of North Chicago,
were arrested Wednesday on murder charges, and prosecutors said
they will seek the death penalty.
   They were ordered held in lieu of $1 million bond each after a
brief hearing today in Lake County Circuit Court. Associate Judge
Harry Hartel set another hearing for Wednesday.
   The arrests and indictments came exactly five years after the
couple's 3-month-old son, Quinten Irby, was poisoned.
   The child lingered near death for more than two years with
severe burn scars on his mouth and trachea. He also had one lung
removed and was kept alive on a ventilator.
   ``He was unable to swallow, to breathe or to speak,'' said
Matthew Chancey, an assistant Lake County state's attorney.
   Quinten died at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago on Aug.
26, 1986, when he was 2{.
   Investigators believe the parents forced sulfuric acid down the
infant's throat on May 31, 1984, and then claimed he was poisoned
by contaminated baby formula.
   Irby filed a lawsuit in August 1987, charging negligence against
the baby formula maker, Abbott Laboratories of North Chicago, and
the grocery store where the formula was allegedly bought.
   The lawsuit claimed that the Similac with Iron formula the
couple gave to Quinten contained a ``foreign and dangerous acidic
and@or lye substance'' and was ``unfit for human consumption.''
   Irby withdrew the lawsuit a year ago.
   Investigators said they were suspicious of the parents early in
the case. Tests on the contents of Quinten's stomach found it to
contain high concentrations of a substance believed to be pure
sulfuric acid.
   But prosecutors were stymied when evidence that was in the
custody of the Illinois Department of Public Health was lost.
Chancey said this included an opened can of baby formula the
parents claimed was contaminated, an unopened can of formula, a
bottle and nipple, and a pair of pants that Irby claimed were
damaged by the contaminated formula.
   A break for prosecutors came last November when the U.S. Supreme
Court, in an Arizona case, ruled that accidentally lost evidence
does not preclude prosecution.
   ``After that decision came down, we decided to take another look
at this case,'' said Chancey. ``This is the type of case that never
leaves your mind.''
   A Lake County grand jury returned the murder charges Wednesday
following several weeks of testimony.
   Chancey said the state will seek the death penalty against Smith
and Irby because the boy was younger than 12 and the crime, under
Illinois statutes, ``was particularly brutal and heinous.''

   President Bush wound up his European trip today
conferring with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in a farewell
meeting that showed some sign of friction between old friends.
   ``It's only with friends that you can take off the gloves and
talk from the heart,'' Bush said after a nearly two-hour private
meeting at 10 Downing Street.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said afterward that the
United States and Britain remain at odds on London's desire to
expel Southeast Asian refugees who arrived illegally in
British-held Hong Kong.
   Baker said ``we support the right of first asylum and freedom of
choice'' for political refugees.
   The British also have misgivings about possible U.S. military
aid to Argentina, Britain's adversary in the 1982 Falklands Islands
war.
   Nevertheless, Bush said the U.S. relationship with Britain ``is
strong and will continue to be.''
   Along with his wife Barbara, Bush also attended a Buckingham
Palace luncheon with Queen Elizabeth II.
   Bush and the first lady and the queen and Prince Philip posed
for pictures in an ornate picture gallery. As they lined up at the
edge of an exquisite carpet, the queen admonished Bush: ``Smile.''
   On the eve of Bush's return to the United States, Baker said he
hopes the president's trip has helped still criticism at home about
his foreign policy and responses to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   ``I would hope that it might put to rest some of that
speculation,'' Baker said. ``It is important, I think, that an
American president be seen to be leading the alliance.''
   Despite their differences on some issues, Bush and Thatcher were
effusive in praising each other for the outcome of this week's NATO
summit in Brussels.
   Bush hailed the ``very, very special relationship'' between the
United States and Britain. Mrs. Thatcher said, ``We think very much
the same way, which isn't surprising.''
   ``It's the end of containment, it's freedom on the offensive, a
peaceful offensive throughout the world,'' she said.
   The two leaders were allies in a successful bid at the NATO
summit to keep short-range nuclear missiles on West German soil.
Mrs. Thatcher credited Bush's leadership as the reason for a
``very, very successful NATO summit.''
   In two days of summit talks, the Western allies embraced Bush's
proposal for negotiating substantial cutbacks in conventional NATO
and Warsaw Pact forces within the next year, and rejected West
German demands for early U.S.-Soviet negotiations on reducing _ and
possibly eliminating _ short-range nuclear missiles.
   The president and his wife, Barbara, joined the queen for lunch
at Buckingham Palace. A dinner with Mrs. Thatcher was the final
event before Bush flies home Friday for a weekend at his
Kennebunkport, Maine, vacation home.
   The president's visit coincided with a subway strike in London,
which created traffic jams 10 miles long on major highways into the
capital and forced many commuters to walk or ride bicycles to work.
Motorists who reached the city found routes of the Bush motorcade
sealed off.
   Mrs. Thatcher is regarded as the United States' most ardent
supporter in the West. At the NATO summit in Brussels, she took an
even harder line than Bush on keeping nuclear missiles in Europe.
   The issue pitted the United States and Britain against West
Germany, after Chancellor Helmut Kohl demanded early East-West
negotiations to reduce and perhaps eliminate short-range nuclear
missiles.
   In the end, Mrs. Thatcher and Bush prevailed in winning a NATO
statement that put off any negotiations indefinitely. It said the
missile talks could not begin until an East-West agreement on
conventional arms had been signed and reductions were under way.
   In Paris, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said
Bush's disarmament proposals generally were positive, but expressed
doubt that agreement on conventional force reductions could be
reached within a year, as Bush had suggested.
   ``I want to emphasize that the British and French forces in West
Germany represent 100,000 men and this creates an imbalance,'' the
French newspaper Le Figaro quoted Shevardnadze as saying.
   Despite the missile dispute, Bush got high marks during a
27-hour stop in West Germany, where he delivered a speech calling
for an end to political divisions in Europe and a dismantling of
the Berlin Wall.
   ``The Cold War began with the division of Europe. It can only
end when Europe is free,'' Bush told 2,000 cheering people in the
Rhine River city of Mainz.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher, who had
prodded Kohl to take an aggressive stance in the missile quarrel,
was effusive in praise of Bush's speech.
   ``It was a brilliant speech,'' Genscher said. ``It met all my
expectations. It gave a vision of a better Europe.''
   In Mainz, Mayor Herman-Hartmut Weyel gave his American visitors
a copy of an anti-nuclear resolution passed by his city council.
``We in Mainz know there is no escape for us if these weapons are
ever used,'' it said.
   The president arrived at dusk Wednesday aboard Air Force One and
was greeted by Mrs. Thatcher and her husband, Denis, on the tarmac
at London's Heathrow Airport.
   After a red-carpet welcome with a military band playing the U.S.
national anthem, Bush boarded a U.S. military helicopter with an
easy wave and smile to the dignitaries.
   Mrs. Thatcher joined him on the 15-mile flight to Winfield
House, the Regent's Park official residence of U.S. Ambassador
Henry Catto.
   While Bush was at 10 Downing Street, Mrs. Bush visited an adult
education and day care center just across the Thames River at
Brixton, south London, where she confessed to cooking students that
her pie crust ``is not one you write home about.''
   Bush, closing out his visit to West Germany, took a two-hour
boat cruise down the Rhine River, passing by ancient castles and
hillside vineyards.
   Bush called it ``an unforgettable day on the Rhine.''
   The White House chartered a second boat for a handful of
photographers and cameramen to ensure maximum coverage of the
highly picturesque trip.
   From London, Bush had words of sympathy and praise for House
Speaker Jim Wright after the fellow Texan announced his resignation
from Congress.
   ``In spite of the present situation, I believe the Wright tenure
was one of effectiveness and dedication to the Congress of the
United States,'' the president said. ``Barbara and I wish Jim and
Betty well in whatever lies ahead.''

<TEXT>
   Supermarkets reopened to long
lines of shoppers today and officials distributed food to the needy
in an effort to end riots and looting by Argentines suffering under
a collapsing economy.
   The death toll from more than a week of unrest rose to 16 today,
but officials said the nation generally was quiet.
   The undersecretary of public security in Buenos Aires province,
Lt. Col. Carlos Pombo, described the situation as ``calm and
returning to normal, despite some tension'' in suburbs around the
capital.
   Federal and provincial government authorities, aided by private
businesses, distributed meat, bread, flour, pasta, powdered milk
and other food to the needy in several Buenos Aires suburbs and
major cities, including Mendoza, Cordoba, La Plata and Tucuman.
   In the hard-hit city of Rosario, 190 miles north of Buenos
Aires, markets that escaped looting during the week opened their
doors, and long lines quickly formed outside.
   In one of the few incidents reported today in Buenos Aires, a
police officer was seriously injured when he was shot in the face
during a shootout with people trying to loot a butcher's shop in
the suburb of Caseros.
   In Tucuman, 820 miles north of the capital, a woman was crushed
to death under sugar bags that fell while she and about 50 other
people were looting a warehouse.
   On Wednesday, police said the owners of a supermarket in
suburban Moreno shot and killed three looters, and 9-year-old
Roberto Segovia died in a hospital from injuries suffered in
looting the night before.
   Eleven people died Monday and Tuesday.
   Scattered looting was reported Wednesday in the industrial
suburbs of the capital and in the provincial capitals of Corrientes
and Mendoza. In some Buenos Aires neighborhoods, vandals briefly
blocked streets with burning tires and threw stones at police.
   Late Wednesday, however, Interior Minister Juan Carlos Pugliese
declared, ``Calm reigns throughout the country.''
   In Rosario, Argentina's second most populous city and its
meat-packing center, 3,000 paramilitary police and members of the
National Guard and Coast Guard patrolled city streets to enforce
the peace and protect stores.
   The government effort to forestall further violence involved
arresting looters and delivering free food to families hardest hit
by Argentina's protracted economic crisis.
   The unrest began last week in the interior cities of Mendoza and
Cordoba after three months of devaluations left the Argentine
currency, the austral, worth one-tenth of its previous value
against the dollar.
   On Monday, President Raul Alfonsin declared a state of siege.
Inflation meanwhile has raged on, and economists say it is expected
to hit 70 percent for the month of May alone.
   According to the conservative Center for a New Majority, real
wages are now worth 35 percent of what they were in December 1983,
when Alfonsin took office to end a seven-year military dictatorship.
   Former President Arturo Frondizi today called for Alfonsin to
resign immediately. He was the first prominent politician to demand
Alfonsin quit. The 80-year-old Frondizi was elected in 1958 and
served until 1962, when his term of office was cut short by a
military coup.
   Alfonsin met Wednesday with President-elect Carlos Menem, who
won the May 14 election, and observers wondered whether an
unpopular lame-duck Alfonsin government can implement another
austerity program in an attempt to curtail inflation and the budget
deficit.
   Menem indicated to reporters that he didn't want to take office
before the scheduled Dec. 10 inauguration: ``I don't want to
interfere with the desire of President Alfonsin to serve out his
mandate,'' he said.
   More than 2,000 people have been arrested over the past nine
days, at least 100 have been shot and wounded, some by rubber
bullets, and dozens more have been injured by tear gas, sticks,
flying glass and rocks during the riots.
   Pugliese claimed a faction of the Everyone for the Fatherland
Movement and other leftists incited the riots, though he offered no
evidence.
   The Everyone for the Fatherland Movement was linked with the
bloody assault on an army base Jan. 23 outside Buenos Aires that
left 27 people dead.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Use of Drug to Reduce Anemia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration today
approved use of a genetically engineered drug that can help reduce
anemia in patients suffering from kidney failure.
   The drug, epoetin, reduces the need for transfusions to add red
blood cells to patients who under go dialysis because their kidneys
have failed, FDA Commissioner Frank Young announced.
   Epoetin ``is great stuff'' said John G. Cole, an editor of The
Journal, Lorain, Ohio, a kidney patient who has participated in
trials of the product over the last two years.
   Once barely able to walk on the beach or carry out the garbage,
Cole said he now plays half-court basketball, works 50-55 hours a
week and works out three times a week.
   Young explained that patients with kidney failure often suffer
anemia because of the loss of a natural chemical which stimulates
their bodies to produce red clood cells.
   Without those cells the body doesn't get enough oxygen, causing
lsos of strength, chest pain and other problems.
   In the past, transfusions have been used to provide new red
cells, but with epoetin that will be unnecessary for most patients,
Young said. The drug stimulates the body to make its own red cells
again.
   The kidney patients will still need regular dialysis treatments,
he pointed out.
   Epoetin is the eleventh drug to be licensed that is produced
through genetic engineering techniques, said Young.
   It was developed under the orphan drug program, designed to
stimulate research on drugs needed by fewer than 200,000 people.
Young said about 95,000 kidney patients would likely use the new
drug, although it could also prove useful for people with other
medical problems which cause anemia, includine AIDS and some forms
of cancer.

<TEXT>
   The army began issuing computerized plastic
identity cards today to Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip as
part of a campaign to tighten control over the Arab population.
   The move coincided with a demand by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir that the army adopt harsher measures to crush the nearly
18-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israel's occupation of
the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   Shamir's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, confirmed reports that the
prime minister wants a tougher approach. ``If current measures are
not enough, we have to consider other measures,'' said Ahimeir.
   At least 10 Palestinians, most of them teen-agers, were wounded
today in clashes with troops in the occcupied lands, Arab hospital
officials said.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, at least 503
Palestinians have been killed, most of them by army gunfire.
Twenty-two Israelis have also died in the violence.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, five Palestinians were shot and
wounded when soldiers broke up a protest march by about 200
chidlren. Troops chased marchers into the city's narrow alleyways,
Arab reports said.
   The protesters carried outlawed Palestinian flags and banners
reading: ``No alternative but the Palestinian state,'' the reports
said.
   In the Gaza Strip, five Palestinians were reported shot and
wounded in clashes with soldiers.
   An army official confirmed that five Palestinians were wounded
in Nablus in what he described as clashes with stone-throwers. He
said he was checking reports of five wounded in Gaza.
   Meanwhile, Jewish extremists waving Israeli flags and singing
Hebrew songs marched through Jerusalem's Arab sector under heavy
police guard today to mark the 22nd anniversary of Israel's capture
of the area in the six-day war.
   At one point in the march through the walled Old City, police
fired tear gas at Arab youths after stones and a bottle were
dropped from a rooftop, causing no injuries. Some of the marchers
had pistols tucked into their belts.
   Hundreds of Palestinians watched the procession silently. One
Arab woman shouted ``Salam,'' or ``peace,'' to a Jewish woman, who
responded with: ``Get out of here. This is our country.''
   The Bank of Israel, meanwhile, said the uprising cost Israel
$630 million in export losses last year, including $280 million in
lost tourism.
   The Jerusalem Post newspaper quoted the bank's governor, Michael
Bruno, as saying the uprising slowed economic growth and created a
climate of uncertainty that deterred foreign investment.
   Also today, Israel rejected charges by the human rights group
Amnesty International that the army violated the rights of
non-violent opponents of the occupation who are being detained
without trial in administrative detention.
   More than 1,000 Palestinians are being detained without charges.
   ``People are being held because of violent activities, not
because of their ideas,'' said a Shamir aide, Avi Pazner. ``Israel
does not use administrative detention lightly.''
   In the Gaza Strip, the army launched a campaign today to
restrict the entry of Palestinians to Israel.
   Palestinians wishing to enter Israel must apply for plastic
cards with a magnetic strip ``like the one you use in a bank,''
said a senior military official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He would not confirm or deny Israeli media reports the cards
would be run through a computer whenever Palestinians pass army
checkpoints separating Gaza and Israel.
   Palestinians convicted of ``serious security or criminal
offenses'' will be denied the computerized identity cards, the
military official said. He said he expected about 1,500 Gaza
residents would be refused them.
   Women and children under the age 16 are exempt from the new
requirement and can continue to enter Israel with their old
Israeli-issued identity cards, the official said.
   He said he expected 70,000 to 80,000 Gazans to apply for the new
cards, mainly so they can keep their jobs in Israel. At least
50,000 Gazans work in Israel.
   The cards are part of an army effort to ``improve our ability to
supervise and control entry from Gaza into Israel,'' the official
said, adding that similar cards might be introduced in the West
Bank.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has said such restrictions are
intended to persuade Palestinians to accept Israel's peace plan,
which calls for elections in the occupied lands. The Palestine
Liberation Organization has rejected the plan because it does not
provide for eventual statehood.
   The Jewish West Bank settlement of Ariel has amended a decision
to issue tags reading ``alien worker'' to Arabs working in the
community of 8,000.
   The introduction of the tags led to charges of racism, and
raised comparisons with the yellow Star of David that Jews were
forced to wear in Nazi Germany.Under new regulations, all visitors
to Ariel, including Jews, must wear the tags, said Dorit Shalit, a
city employee.

<UNK>Police Arrest Leader of British Embassy Sit-In</UNK>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black labor leader who
encamped at the British Embassy in March to protest police
restrictions was arrested today for violating them, authorities
said.
   Donsie Khumalo, a regional official of the Congress of South
African Trade Unions, was one of six black activists who staged a
26-hour sit-in at the embassy on March 29-30 to protest
restrictions placed on them after they were released from detention.
   In the course of the sit-in, police said, Khumalo violated the
restrictions, which require him to report twice daily to police,
confine him to his home at night and limit his political activities.
   Similar restrictions have been placed on hundreds of detainees
released in recent months after being held without charge under
state-of-emergency regulations.
   Khumalo was released a week before the sit-in after joining a
widespread hunger strike. He and the other activists were
embittered by the British Embassy's refusal to let them stay inside
the building or use its toilets and telephones.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest and one
of the most militantly anti-apartheid labor federations in the
country, issued a statement demanding Khumalo's release. It said he
was taken to court today and ordered held without bail until a
court appearance on Aug. 30.
   Government officials have indicated that the state of emergency,
declared on June 12, 1986, will be renewed next week for a fourth
year.
   The labor federation demanded that the emergency be lifted and
denounced the restrictions as ``cruel persecution ... of people who
have spent months, sometimes years in detention.''
   It also said it planned a three-day protest starting on Monday
in the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg. The labor federation
said police there have failed to stop factional violence between
federation allies and followers of Inkatha, a more conservative
Zulu political organization.
   Emergency regulations prohibit general strikes, but most
protests organized by anti-apartheid groups in recent years have
consisted of supporters not going to work or school.
   The labor federation said it decided to stage the protest after
the death early today of Jabu Ndlovu, a shop steward for a
metalworkers' union whose house was attacked and burned on May 21.
   Mrs. Ndlovu's husband and one of her daughters were killed in
the attack, and she had been hospitalized since then for treatment
of burns.
   Her home was burned after she complained at a news conference
about allegations of collaboration between Inkatha and police.
   Police have said they take no sides in the conflict, which has
claimed nearly 2,000 lives in Natal Province since late 1986.

<HEAD>Federal Prosecutor Looking Into News Leaks</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: New throughout with more details of leaks investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A career federal prosecutor is assigned to
investigate news leaks that the FBI is investigating allegations
against a half-dozen prominent Democratic officeholders, the
Justice Department said today.
   The career Justice Department prosecutor will conduct
interviews, take sworn statements and could seek polygraph
examinations to determine who is responsible for the unauthorized
disclosures of information, spokesman David Runkel said today.
   ``If we knew who the leakers were today, clearly it would be the
attorney general's intention to dismiss them,'' Runkel said. Such
leaks are against Justice Department policy and may also violate
federal law, he said.
   At least two FBI agents have also been assigned to the
investigation to conduct interviews, Runkel said, adding that it
would be ``premature to say'' where the investigation would lead.
   Runkel said the career government prosecutor from the
department's criminal division, whom he declined to identify, would
investigate leaks leading to stories about investigations or
preliminary inquires involving Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas; Reps.
Tony Coehlo, D-Calif.; William H. Gray III, D-Pa.; Gus Savage,
D-Ill.; Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh first ordered the investigation
last week following a story in the Los Angeles Times that the FBI
was conducting a preliminary inquiry of investments by Bradley and
Coehlo, the House majority whip who announced his resignation
Friday.
   Stories this week that the FBI was conducting preliminary
inquiries of allegations involving Wright and Gray, the
fourth-ranking House Democrat, prompted charges from House
Democrats that the Republican-run Justice Department was
responsible for politically inspired leaks.
   Leaks leading to stories that the Justice Department was
investigating allegations that Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's
non-voting delegate, hired Savage's son for a non-show job are also
part of the investigation, Runkel said.
   Runkel denied the suggestion that the leaks were coming from top
officials on Thornburgh's staff, saying: ``I don't believe that's
the case, based on people I've talked with.''
   But the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and two top
Democrats on the panel charged that the leaks were politically
inspired.
   ``It appears to us from these articles that persons in the
Department of Justice are using leaks for political purposes
against House Democrats,'' said the letter from Chairman Jack
Brooks, D-Texas and Reps. Don Edwards, D-Calif. and Robert W.
Kastenmeier, D-Wisc.
   ``Nothing could be more destructive of the criminal justice
process and run a greater risk of hampering the work of the
department's career criminal investigators than the appearance that
information about the existence of investigation is being used for
political advantage,'' the letter said.
   In a separate letter to Thornburgh, Gray, who is seeking the
post of majority whip being vacated by Coehlo, questioned why the
Justice Department waited ``until the eve of Democratic leadership
changes'' to send FBI agents to his home on Memorial Day. The
agents told Gray they were investigating at least one of his
employees.
   Jon Plebani, Gray's staff director, said Wednesday: ``Every
employee who works for Bill Gray comes to work and does work. He's
a very demanding boss.''
   The Justice Department, responding to Gray's complaint, said
Wednesday that Thornburgh had ordered an investigation of leaks
over the past week.
   In their letter, Brooks, Edwards and Kastenmeier told Thornburgh
that ``unless you take clear and aggressive steps to stop these
leaks we will have to conclude that they have your support.''
   Rep. David E. Bonior, D-Mich., who is one of Gray's opponents in
the race to succeed Coelho as whip, also chastised the Justice
Department.
   ``The American people are fed up with the effort to use
innuendos and rumors to discredit our public officials,'' Bonior
said. ``We must stop this destructive politics of character
assassination.''
   On Wednesday, Runkel described Thornburgh as ``disturbed by
leaks that have come out of the department concerning matters which
have led to news stories on members of Congress.''
   ``If there is some attempted interference here in the actions of
the House Democratic Caucus it is of concern to us,'' Runkel said.

   Iraq is building a $45 million clock in
Baghdad, featuring gold-plated hands and a 141-foot pendulum, the
Iraqi News Agency reported Thursday.
   The 167-foot clock tower is rising in the Harithiya district,
overlooking the highway connecting downtown Baghdad with the
international airport, the official news agency said.
   At the base of the tower will be a museum, shopping mall,
restaurants and conference halls, the report said. The ground floor
of the building will be reserved for statues depicting major events
in the ``heroic life'' of President Saddam Hussein, starting with
his birth, it added.
   Surrounding the building will be 23 water fountains, lawns and
rose gardens covering an area of 15 square miles.
   The clock will have hands coated in gold donated to the
government by ``the brave Iraqi women'' during the eight-year war
with Iran, the news agency said.
   In memory of the war dead, a crystal ball ``filled with samples
of the weapons used by our martyrs in defense of their homeland''
will be attached to the end of the pendulum, said the report,
monitored in Nicosia.

   International conservation groups called Thursday
for an immediate ban on world trade in ivory to protect the African
elephant from greater slaughter.
   The beast will be virtually extinct within 50 years at the
present rate of killings, according to the World Conservation Union
and the World Wide Fund For Nature, formerly known as the World
Wildlife Fund.
   Charles de Haes, director-general of the fund, urged governments
to outlaw ivory imports immediately. Otherwise, the slaughter of
elephants increase dramatically as poachers try to sell as much
ivory as possible before anticipated agreement on an international
trade ban in October, he said.
   Japan and Hong Kong account for most ivory imports, de Haes said.
   Only 625,000 elephants remain in Africa, half the level of 10
years ago, the organizations said.
   Poachers have killed most of the big male elephants and are
switching to females and young beasts, the report said. As a
result, three times as many elephants must be killed to provide the
same amount of ivory as 10 years ago.

   Four paintings by Russian-born Jewish artist
Marc Chagall were sold at auction for prices ranging from $253,000
to $385,000, an official said Thursday.
   ``For late works of Chagall, these are very high prices.
Usually, you would get these kind of sums for really important
early works. It shows that the demand is very strong,'' said Rifka
Saker, co-director of Sotheby's Tel Aviv.
   Chagall's ``Self-Portrait with Flowers,'' painted in 1969, sold
for $385,000. The oil painting shows Chagall sitting in his studio.
   Another oil, ``Green Cockerel with Lovers over Paris,'' sold for
$253,000. Painted around 1950, it shows two lovers in front of the
Eiffel Tower.
   A second self-portrait, ``Artist Painting the Lovers,'' brought
$308,000. The water color, painted in 1981, shows Chagall sitting
on a chair, at work with palette and brush.
   The 1979 water color ``Lovers with Flowers,'' sold for $264,000.
   The paintings were sold Tuesday to private collectors from
Scandinavia, France and the United States, Mrs. Saker said.
   Chagall was born in 1887 in Byelorussia, but spent most of his
life in France. He died in 1985.

   A landslide caused by heavy rains
collapsed tunnels of a gold mine and started a fire in a remote
mining region. Authorities said at least 11 people were killed and
21 trapped in the mine.
   Officials said at least nine other people were injured and 165
homes were destroyed in the blaze that followed Tuesday's disaster
in the mining town of Mount Diwalwal, 580 miles southeast of
Manila, officials said. Earlier, officials reported that 180 homes
burned.
   Mario Luis Jacinto, regional director of the Bureau of Mines,
said at least 535 prospectors escaped before 13 of the 27 tunnels
in the mine collapsed. He said 21 miners were believed missing.
   But Crispina Abat of the Civil Defense said there were no
reliable figures on the number of people in the mine at the time.
She said there was confusion over the numbers of missing.
   Two miners were killed by falling timber and two others
suffocated in a nearby shaft, Jacinto said. He said three trapped
workers located Tuesday were also presumed dead after rescuers
failed to contact them Thursday.
   The landslide also caused a charcoal pit in a blacksmith shop to
tumble and ignited a three-hour fire in a nearby housing area that
burned 165 shanties. The fire killed four people and injured nine,
Jacinto added.
   Mining officials declared the tunnels danger zones in July but
gold prospectors ignored the advice, according to Lt. Col. Nelson
Estares, a local police chief.
   Jacinto said the rains had loosened soil in the area, causing
the landslide. ``Rescue operations are being hampered by ground
movements still occurring in the area,'' he said. The heavy rains
continued, he said.
   Jacinto said miners reported seeing cracks on the walls of the
shafts five and a half hours before the collapse and had time to
leave the tunnels.
   ``Most of the workers came out, but there were others who were
hardheaded and refused to leave,'' Jacinto said.
   The Diwalwal mining area has occasionally been hit by cave-ins,
but most went unreported because miners fear the government will
halt operations there.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, recovering
from surgery to stop intestinal bleeding, was allowed out of his
Tehran hospital bed for an hour Thursday, Tehran radio reported.
   The 86-year-old revolutionary leader also was permitted to go
outside in an open area around the hospital, according to the
report on the state-run radio.
   He met with relatives and close friends while he was outside and
performed his midday prayers there, the radio reported.
   It did not say whether he was in a wheelchair or walked when he
was allowed out of bed for the first time since he underwent
surgery May 23 after doctors discovered internal bleeding in his
digestive tract.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khomeini's medical team
as saying that his ``general condition is very satisfactory, and we
expect quick and complete recuperation.''
   Tehran Television reported Khomeini suffered a ``slight heart
complication'' Saturday. It gave no details, but said the condition
had been ``relieved'' by Sunday.
   Iran's main opposition group, the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq,
or People's Holy Warriors, said Khomeini had suffered a heart
attack after the operation. The claim could not be independently
confirmed.
   Iranian TV on Monday broadcast footage it said was taken after
surgery, showing Khomeini in his hospital bed being coaxed by two
relatives to eat a few spoonfuls of soup, while his grandson
scampered about the room and his 43-year-old son, Ahmad, sat nearby.
   Khomeini's personal physician said the revolutionary patriarch
was in excellent condition and was one of ``history's exceptions.''
Khomeini has been reported ailing since he suffered a heart attack
in 1986. Since then he has rarely been seen outside his home in the
north Tehran suburb of Jamaran.

   Yuri N. Afanasyev, Moscow historian and
progressive communist, is learning what it means to be a People's
Deputy.
   Arriving at the new Soviet parliament with a mandate won in the
first contested elections in 70 years, Afanasyev has used national
TV to bring the concerns of progressives to millions.
   During breaks in debate at the Congress of People's Deputies, he
rushes from the Kremlin to meet voters and students eager to know
what is going on in the corridors and cloakrooms not shown on
television.
   Hundreds of Muscovites jammed into a sweltering, decrepit
lecture hall Wednesday to hear Afanasyev field questions for an
hour about the work of a Congress that has riveted the nation.
   Already well-known in Moscow and to progressive intellectuals
across the country for his activities with Memorial, a group formed
to chronicle Josef Stalin's purges and remember their victims,
Afanasyev shot to national fame when he took the Congress floor
Saturday.
   A professor rather than a politician, he offered no political
program. But in less than 10 minutes, he delivered a speech that
captured the widespread sense of disappointment with the Congress'
election of deputies to its new legislature, the Supreme Soviet.
   He said an ``aggressively obedient majority'' in the parliament
had elected a ``Brezhnev-Stalin Supreme Soviet.'' The phrases
instantly entered the popular lexicon, recurring time and again in
heated discussions of the Congress around Moscow.
   ``His speech was the turning point of the Congress,'' said one
Moscow mathematician.
   On Wednesday, Afanasyev indicated that even many of his fellow
progressives had been offended by his description of the new
legislature.
   But he was still forthright in voicing many radical demands,
winning his strongest round of applause from the audience when he
said, ``Of course this Congress should take power into its hands''
and ``release the party from its right to make powerful decisions.''
   The party's ruling Politburo and Central Committee should
continue to decide party matters, he added swiftly, but ``powerful
decisions should be taken by the Congress.''
   Afanasyev, a ruddy-faced man in his 50s, told the crowd at the
history institute where he is rector that he was surprised to
receive support for his views when he met voters in Noginsk, about
25 miles east of Moscow, on Sunday, when the Congress was not in
session.
   The voters were more enthusiastic about getting the Congress to
change the political structure than in its solving day-to-day
consumer problems, he said.
   Afanasyev, a member of a group of progressive Moscow deputies,
said the fledgling organization is slowly gaining support from
deputies representing other areas of the country.
   Despite his harsh remarks, he remains devoted to th work of the
Congress.
   ``The Soviet people pinned so many hopes _ all their hopes, the
future of their children _ on this Congress,'' Afanasyev said.
``This is the body of deputies we must trust'' to change the
country.

<HEAD>Iranian Newspapers Threaten Britain Over Rushdie Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian newspaper today said Britain
should expect ``heavy blows'' in retaliation for a weekend clash in
London between Moslem demonstrators and police, who arrested 84
people.
   The Farsi-language newspaper Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial
that Britain has started ``a dangerous game by challenging
Moslems.''
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
quoted the editorial as saying that actions like the crackdown on
demonstrators Saturday ``exposed the British government to heavy
blows.''
   About 20,000 Moslems took part in the march and chanted slogans
demanding the death of British author Salman Rushdie, Moslems.
   Relations between Iran and Britain have been at a low ebb for
three months.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government recalled
its diplomats from the Iranian capital after Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini issued a religious edict on Feb. 14 calling on Moslems to
kill Rushdie.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since then.

<HEAD>Underwater Search Begins For Victims of Bridge Collapse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police divers today began searching the Great
Miami River for victims and clues to last week's bridge collapse
that killed up to five people.
   Only one diver would go down at a time and would stay only about
one minute because of concerns about the river's strong current and
low visibility, said Frank Weikel, a spokesman for the Hamilton
County Sheriff's Department.
   Authorities believe that as many as five people died in the
rain-swollen river after two vehicles fell in when a temporary
bridge over U.S. 52 collapsed during rush-hour Friday.
   Just one victim has been found so far. Authorities today
identified a woman's body that was found Tuesday, about five miles
downriver, as that of a 52-year-old suburban Cincinnati woman. The
woman's daughter is among the missing.
   One police diver made several exploratory plunges into the river
Wednesday at the site, 12 miles west of Cincinnati at Miamitown.
Investigators hope the divers can help find the remaining victims
and clues to why it fell.
   National Transportation Safety Board personnel investigating the
collapse are especially interested in obtaining the steel bridge
support that failed, said Jean Fasone, head of the NTSB
investigative team.
   She said that pressure from Miamitown merchants, who feared
losses when an aging bridge that is being replaced was closed,
prompted the county to select a time-saving design for a one-lane
temporary bridge. The temporary bridge opened in December and was
scheduled to be in use for about a year.
   Engineers have suggested that the strong current from the
flooded river, plus the pounding from tree trunks and other debris,
prompted the collapse. But a full-scale engineering investigation
has been postponed until the river's level drops.
   Ms. Fasone said her team probably will be on site through this
weekend, but won't have its report completed for about six months,
she said.

<HEAD>Pope Gets Polite Reception at Start of Scandinavian Tour</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lutherans in this nation of only 27,800
Catholics welcomed Pope John Paul II politely Thursday as he began
a tour of Scandinavia, where the Protestant Reformation vanquished
Rome four centuries ago.
   He described himself as a brother and friend in making the first
visit by a pope to the overwhelmingly Lutheran region. Sparse
crowds and reservations voiced in some quarters were expected to
make it one of the most unusual of his 42 foreign tours.
   John Paul arrived from Rome on a cloudy Nordic spring day that
later turned rainy. Awaiting him at the airport were a few
well-wishers and a line of dignitaries led by Prime Minister Gro
Harlem Brundtland.
   The pope gave assurances of his intentions and emphasized that
Norway's 1,000-year-old Christian tradition was common ground in a
region that outlawed Catholicism until the last century.
   ``Standing here on Norwegian soil, I am fully conscious of the
special significance of this occasion,'' he said, speaking in
English. ``For the first time ever, a bishop of Rome, a succcesor
of the Apostle Peter, has come to Norway and to the Nordic
countries.
   ``I come, not as the representative of a political or national
interest, but as a witness of the Gospel and of our Lord Savior
Jesus Christ, as a brother deeply concerned with the well-being of
his brothers and sisters in every part of the world.
   ``I come to Norway as a friend, full of esteem and love for its
noble people and its millenary Christian heritage.''
   Norway is the first stop on a 10-day tour that also includes
Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Sweden. They have only 197,000
Catholics among them, less than 1 percent of the population.
   Vatican officials have said John Paul's aim is to spread a
message of Christian ethics in a highly secular region, boost the
morale of the few Catholics and strengthen relations with the
Lutheran church.
   One of Norway's 11 Lutheran bishops refused to attend any
meeting with the pontiff. The Lutheran church in Denmark has
insisted he not speak at a prayer service in Copenhagen next week.
   Scandinavian attitudes on family and sexual issues differ
sharply from Roman Catholic teaching, which forbids divorce,
abortion and contraception. A leading Oslo newspaper, the tabloid
Dagbladet, published a caricature Thursday depicting John Paul's
miter in the shape of a condom.
   In what Roman Catholic officials described as an unusual gesture
to counter questions about the visit, King Olav V took John Paul to
the balcony of the 19th century royal palace to greet about 1,000
people. Usually the king takes only royal guests with him for such
appearances.
   The crowd applauded politely and children waved red and white
flags of John Paul's native Poland.
   ``Welcome to Norway. I am extremely glad to see you in our
country,'' the king said when John Paul arrived for a 30-minute
audience.
   Later, the pope celebrated Mass in a drizzle on the parade
ground of a 14th century fortress. State-run TV estimated the crowd
at 10,000-12,000, including Polish refugees who raised Solidarity
banners.
   In his homily, John Paul said the purpose of his visit was to
``encourage a serious reflection on the flight from God and from
higher moral values which is typical of secularized society.''
   He was fully aware of the resistance to his visit by some
Lutherans.
   ``The church and I personally are undertaking an ecumenical
meeting,'' he told reporters on the flight from Rome. ``Certainly,
not all the the Lutheran bishops share this ecumenical path, as,
sometimes, some Catholics also have trouble with it.''
   John Paul is fond of skiing and was asked if he intended to do
any in Scandinavia. He replied:
   ``I've been told that the best solution for ecumenism and for
the rapproachment of the churches would be if the pope, the king of
Sweden or the king of Norway could go skiing together.''

<HEAD>No Legislation Likely Any Time Soon, Senate Ag Chief Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is not likely to pass drough relief
legislation any time soon, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee predicted Thursday.
   ``We have a winter wheat problem,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., adding that there was no indication the early spring drought
caused problems with other crops.
   ``I'm very concerned about winter wheat,'' he said. ``But I
don't want to move until we see about present crops.''
   Despite heavy rains in recent days, winter wheat production is
expected to be mostly fair to poor, the Agriculture Department said
this week.
   In Kansas, the wheat looks poor to very poor, the department
said. Harvesting of the crop is under way in California, Georgia,
Oklahoma and Texas, while the wheat is still growing elsewhere.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and begins to sprout in
early spring, but shortage of spring rain, particularly in Kansas,
has devastated the crop.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., has introduced legislation that would
extend the 1988 drought relief law to this year's winter wheat
crop, but no further action has been taken on the bill.
   Leahy said he would ask Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to
brief members of the Agriculture Committee and other senators
interested in drought legislation soon.
   Yeutter, touring Iowa drought areas earlier this week, cautioned
against overreaction. ``We have to be careful we don't overestimate
the problems and respond in a way that just isn't called for under
the circumstances,'' he said.
   ``We don't know that there is a drought,'' Sen. Rudy Boschwitz,
R-Minn., said Wednesday. Both he and Leahy made their comments
after a news conference on an unrelated topic.
   Both senators mentioned the speed at which Congress acted to
pass drought legislation last year and said action should be slower
this time.
   ``We will take appropriate steps, but we won't act
precipitously,'' said Leahy.
   ``I don't anticipate legislation coming up on the agenda right
away,'' he said.
   The House Agriculture Committee last week passed drought
legislation that would extend the 1988 law to many crops besides
winter wheat. The bill has not been voted on by the full House.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush chose the appropriate country to
break spontaneously into a rendition of ``I'm a Little Teapot,''
gestures and all.
   Mrs. Bush was inspired by a colorful paper teapot thrust at her
by an eager child during the first lady's only solo appearance in
tea-loving Britain.
   Mrs. Bush visited a day care center as well as classes in
cooking, English-language and fashion design during a 75-minute
visit to the Lambeth Institute's Strand Center, an adult education
school. It is in Brixton, the poor south London area hit by
anti-police riots four years ago.
   ``Do you know it?'' asked Mrs. Bush, as she sang the classic
English nursery rhyme about a teapot, short and stout. The first
lady shaped a spout with her left arm.
   Education Secretary Kenneth Baker, who accompanied Mrs. Bush on
the outing, smiled encouragingly. The 3-year-old children, perhaps
too young, looked bewildered.
   The school's classes, mostly in primary education, attract an
average of 2,000 students per week to courses of varying length.
Some 65 percent come from ``ethnic communities,'' according to the
Education Department.
   ``I am putting my focus in the United States on family
literacy,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   Mrs. Bush called the Strand Center ``a marvelous coalition of
public agencies.''
   In the cooking class, students who hope to become caterers and
chefs were making strudel pastry, noisily slapping mounds of dough
on the counters.
   ``My pie crust is not one you write home about; you know what I
mean,'' Mrs. Bush said as she worked the dough herself. ``I envy
you. This is gorgeous.''
   One fashion student, Icema Paschal, told Mrs. Bush she was
wearing a dress she had made especially for the occasion, and the
first lady complimented her on it.
   Afterward, Ms. Paschal said about the first lady: ``I think
she's quite down to earth, quite nice. She's quite a relaxed
person.''
   Gulshan Ramzan, a special needs tutor, said, ``It was wonderful.
My students, although mentally handicapped, they were so excited.''
   ``I applaud her enormously for coming here,'' said Neil Fletcher
of the Inner London Education Authority. He took the opportunity to
attack the government's plans to abolish the authority, which will
force the center to rely on local government funds.
   Riots broke out in Brixton in September 1985 after a woman was
accidentally shot by a policeman during a raid on her home.
Hundreds of rioters set fire to buildings and looted stores.

<HEAD>Students Charged By Stanford In Biggest Case Since '60s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first such mass action since the
1960s, Stanford officials have filed disciplinary charges against
53 students who took over the university president's office
demanding better treatment of minorities on campus.
   Fifty of the students were among those arrested during the
takeover May 15, said Sally Cole, Stanford's judicial affairs
officer. The charges were announced Wednesday.
   ``It's hypocrisy,'' said Elsa Tsutaoka, of the Asian American
Students Association, at a news conference to protest the school's
decision.
   ``We're being charged and prosecuted, when they don't charge
people who deface posters and hold Ku Klux Klan-like
demonstrations,'' she said.
   Tsutaoka referred to incidents of racial bias last year at the
prestigious school, including a racial slur that was scrawled
across a black fraternity's poster.
   The action Wednesday was the largest campus judicial action
since May 1969, when 78 students were charged for taking over
Encina Hall in protest of the Vietnam War.
   In that action, 14 students were suspended and 48 others were
placed on probation and ordered to pay fines of $3,500 to the
university.
   Students charged with violations of what school rules call a
``fundamental standard'' cannot be granted their degrees until the
proceeding is complete.
   In the incident last month, about 60 people took over the
Stanford president's office for several hours. When negotiations
between school administrators and protesters failed, Santa Clara
County sheriff's deputies began making arrests.
   Many of the accused students face misdemeanor criminal charges
later this month in Palo Alto Municipal Court.
   They have until next Wednesday to submit their defenses to
officials in the university case.

   The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Eastern
Europe and Mongolia is on schedule with the pullout of more than
10,850 soldiers as of Thursday, Tass said.
   Col. Gen. Bronislav Omelichev said that as of Thursday, more
than 3,350 Soviet officers and men had returned to the Soviet Union
from East Germany, 1,000 from Czechoslovakia, 4,500 from Hungary
and more than 2,800 from Mongolia, the official news agency
reported.
   ``The Soviet force withdrawal from allied countries has been
proceeding strictly according to schedule,'' Omelichev, a first
deputy chief of the general staff, was quoted as saying.
   Tanks and artillery pieces were also withdrawn, Tass said,
including 1,650 tanks and 120 artillery pieces from East Germany,
150 tanks and artillery pieces from Czechoslovakia, 320 tanks and
160 artillery pieces from Hungary and 200 tanks, about 170
artillery pieces and 14 aircraft from Mongolia.
   The withdrawals are part of the overall reduction of 500,000
Soviet troops announced by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the
United Nations in December. The pullout is being conducted in
stages expected to last two years.
   The Eastern European pullout began April 25, and the Mongolian
withdrawal began May 15.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Not All Good For Environment, Says Soviet Environmentalist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The reforms of Mikhail S. Gorbachev have been
a mixed blessing for the Soviet environmental movement, exposing
problems but creating economic obstacles to righting past wrongs,
says a Soviet environmentalist.
   Until Gorbachev instituted a policy of glasnost, or greater
openness, discussion of ecological problems had been suppressed in
the Soviet Union for decades, said Arvids Ulme, president of the
Latvian Environmental Club, known in Latvia as VAK.
   Ulme, However, told U.S. officials in meetings late last week to
``look at perestroika in a different way, to realize that there is
a downside to perestroika,'' the Russian word for economic
restructuring.
   ``The economic reforms are speeding up the destruction of the
environment because they are aimed primarily at saving the
economy,'' Ulme said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Economic resources are tight, and enterprises that for the first
time must be self-supporting find they have little to spare for
environmental clean-up, he said. Moreover, the emphasis is on
increasing production.
   VAK is representative of the ``green'' movement of grass-roots
political organizations in the Soviet Union _ the Baltic republics
of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in particular _ where
environmental complaints go hand in hand with nationalist concerns.
   ``Those protesting the country's environmental ills have many
other complaints against the regime,'' Central Intelligence Agency
analyst Christine Westbrook wrote last December in the Christian
Science Monitor.
   The environmental issue is one of many that have their roots in
the forced annexation of the Baltic republics by Moscow during
World War II. The United States does not honor that annexation.
   ``The refusal to recognize the legitimacy of the forced
incorporation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the Soviet
empire has been a longstanding and fundamental tenet of American
policy toward the Soviet Union,'' Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State Paula J. Dobriansky reaffirmed in a March 11 speech that was
subsequently issued as a policy paper.
   The administration, she said, would seek to ``establish and
maintain regular contact with a range of emerging political, social
and ecological informal groups in the Baltic states.''
   The Baltic environmental groups comprise key components of wider
national front movements that far outpolled local Communist Parties
in March 26 elections for the national Congress of People's
Deputies, which convened a week ago in Moscow.
   Ulme's group contends that Kremlin economic policy not only
pollutes the environment, but also threatens native populations.
   ``It's genocide,'' he said.
   Moscow-based ministries make decisions affecting about 90
percent of the economic activity in each of the 15 Soviet
republics, and that includes the heavy polluting industries,
according to published speeches by Communist Party officials from
the Baltic republics.
   Gaining control of those enterprises lies at the heart of the
Baltic drive to achieve greater autonomy from Moscow, said Ulme.
   The Kremlin thus far has balked at attempts by Estonia and
Lithuania to assert greater autonomy, but the ``greens'' have had
some success.
   An estimated 6,000 people demonstrated last Sept. 17 at the
Ignalina atomic power station in Lithuania, and the movement later
collected 600,000 signatures protesting construction of a third
reactor at the site. Official Soviet media credits the campaign
with stopping the third unit.
   VAK and other environmental groups organized protests of more
than 100,000 people last Sept. 3 to protest pollution of the Gulf
of Riga, and they successfully battled construction of a
hydroelectric project at Daugavpils and construction of a subway
system in the Latvian capital of Riga.
   Ulme said that VAK opposed the subway not because members were
against mass transportation, but because the construction, like
other major industrial projects, would require the immigration of
large numbers of Russian workers.
   ``It would employ 50,000 workers, and they would be
non-Latvians,'' said Ulme. The construction of major enterprises in
Latvia already has caused such a huge immigration that Latvians now
constitute only about 50 percent of the population. The percentages
are about 80 percent in Lithuania and 60 percent in Estonia.
   Latvian environmentalists are now trying to close down or clean
up an oil refinery built with help from the U.S. Occidental Oil
Corp. in the port city of Ventspils, where residents are afflicted
by skin and respiratory problems of epidemic proportions, according
to accounts in the Soviet press.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Art restorers probably will strip the loincloths
from many figures in Michelangelo's ``The Last Judgment'' in the
Sistine Chapel, it was reported Thursday.
   ``Many of the veils that cover the nudity in `The Last Judgment'
by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel will probably be removed,''
Fabrizio Mancinelli, director of Vatican restoration work, told the
Roman Catholic magazine 30 Days.
   Michelangelo painted the main altar wall containing ``The Last
Judgment'' in 1536-41. Pope Pius IV, scandalized by the nudes,
ordered artist Daniele da Volterra to paint loincloths on some of
the figures about two decades later.
   Mancinelli said da Volterra's paintings would be too difficult
to remove since they were frescoes, and only those loincloths added
in the late 17th century and 18th century would be erased, the
magazine said.
   The Sistine Chapel has been under restoration since 1980.

   When Richard Gephardt called to inform Ed
Jenkins he had decided to run for House majority leader instead of
seeking the presidency in 1992, the Georgia congressman didn't miss
a beat.
   ``I said I've made the same decisions,'' Jenkins recalled with a
laugh as e discussed his campaign against Gephardt, a Missouri
Democrat, for the job that's expected to come open next week when
Rep. Tom Foley of Washington is elected to replace Jim Wright as
speaker of the House.
   Jenkins, who is serving a seventh term in the House,
acknowledges he cannot match the national reputation Gephardt, who
also is a seven-term congressman, achieved with his 1988 bid for
the Democratic presidential nomination.
   But the secret ballot election of a majority leader by the House
Democratic Caucus is very different from a presidential campaign,
and Jenkins insists he's in the race to win.
   ``A lot of people have written me off in the press, but this is
not a popularity contest,'' he said in an interview Wednesday.
   Jenkins began lining up support last week for an expected
majority leader race against Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the
majority whip. But Coelho's surprise announcement Friday that he
was resigning rather than face an ethics investigation of his
personal finances freed Gephardt to jump into the race.
   ``He wasn't my choice of a person to run against,'' Jenkins said
of Gephardt, who built his presidential campaign largely with the
support of House Democrats. ``But I didn't feel at that time I
could back away. And I feel this thing is doable.''
   While Gephardt quickly lined up commitments from many of the
House Democrats who supported his presidential bid, Jenkins said
he's been pleasantly surprised at the willingness of his Democratic
colleagues to listen to his message.
   ``I really believe that if the Democratic Party wants to
eliminate ... the gradual loss of middle-income people, we've got
to make the leadership broad enough that we have a conservative or
a moderate at the table helping to make policy,'' he said.
   ``I am very good at building coalitions,'' he added. ``If I had
three months on this, regardless of how popular Gephardt is, I
would beat Gephardt.''
   Jenkins' main disadvantage is that he starts with only a small
base of support. There are only 55 Southern Democrats in the
259-member House Democratic Caucus, and Jenkins said he has to hold
that base if he is to have any chance at all.
   But even if he doesn't win, and Jenkins is not willing to
concede that possibility, he said his campaign at the very least
will help open doors for other Southern Democrats in the House.
   ``I might pave the way for somebody to be (House Democratic)
caucus chairman, or I might pave the way for good committee
assignments for other Southerners,'' he said.
   Jenkins said he hopes his campaign will demonstrate that
Southern Democrats are ``no longer sitting back, they want to play
in this game, they want to be a part of the party, they want to
broaden the party, and they insist upon broadening it.
   ``It's no longer going to be a party perceived to be just for
liberals,'' he said.

   President Bush had lunch with Queen Elizabeth II
on Thursday, sampled the splendor of Buckingham Palace and smiled
for the cameras at her majesty's command.
   The royal event began with a glitch over the delayed opening of
Barbara Bush's car door, but by the time lunch ended 30 minutes
behind schedule there were smiles all around and the queen told the
president: ``I hope to see you again soon.''
   When the presidential limousine pulled up to the palace's
red-carpeted Grand Entrance, Bush jumped out. But nobody opened
Mrs. Bush's door until the queen, frowning and shaking her head,
raised her voice and said: ``Open it.''
   A U.S. Secret Service agent complied immediately and Mrs. Bush,
wearing an emerald green dress, emerged smiling as though nothing
had happened.
   It was the Bushes' first taste of British royal hospitality and
the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, brought out one of
Britain's biggest tourist attractions _ the 2nd Battalion Scots
Guards in their red tunics and bearskin hats.
   The president arrived at Buckingham Palace from talks with Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher at her Downing Street residence.
Escorted by Philip, he inspected a 100-strong honor guard mounted
by the Scots Guards after their band played the U.S. national
anthem.
   ``That was so beautiful,'' Bush told his hosts. ``I have never
heard `The Star-Spangled Banner' being played better.''
   Then he added hastily: ``with all respect to the Marine band.''
   Both couples then went inside, chatting animatedly as they
walked through a few of the palace's 600 rooms on their way to
cocktails with the 30 other luncheon guests.
   Between cocktails and lunch, the Bushes and their royal hosts
slipped out for a quick look at the mainly 17th century Dutch
masterpieces in the palace picture gallery.
   ``It's just us. It's very quiet,'' Bush said in a joking
reference to the cocktail hubbub he left behind.
   As they approached photographers, the queen, wearing a blue and
white striped silk dress, told Bush with a grin: ``Smile.'' He
obeyed.
   Luncheon was served in the ivory and gold Music Room overlooking
the 45-acre palace garden. The magnificent domed room with 18 blue
and gilt columns has been used for many royal christenings
including those of Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, and
Charles' heir, Prince William.
   Flanked by the queen and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Bush
sat down to a meal of smoked salmon mousse, duck with honey and
brandy sauce, broad beans, asparagus and potatoes, artichoke salad
and mango ice cream.
   The three wines included two which the queen served Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife Raisa when they lunched
together at Windsor Castle in April. They are an Alsatian white
Gewurztraminer Dopff 1983 and the queen's private port, Royal
Vintage 1955.
   Buckingham Palace said the queen's choice of wines was
``coincidence.''
   The guests included Mrs. Thatcher's husband Denis, Secretary of
State James Baker III, his British counterpart Sir Geoffrey Howe,
Terry Hands, artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Theater,
and Charles Wilson, editor of The Times of London.
   When former President Reagan went to Buckingham Palace just a
year ago for tea with the queen, a U.S. television reporter shouted
questions to him, breeching accepted behavior at formal royal
occasions.
   To avoid a repetition, reporters at the entrance were made to
stand behind a sound-proof glass screen.

   Just plunk down $6 to $10 and step into ``Short
Takes,'' a video version of the old bus station photo booth, then
unleash your talents to produce a job resume, birthday greeting _
even a ``Dear John'' letter.
   ``I bumped into a guy at a party last night. He had just come
back from a visit in Mississippi and instead of a thank-you note,
he sent a video,'' said Bruce Goldstein, 41, a Minneapolis
entrepreneur and real estate developer, who's starting the service.
   The idea for ``Short Takes'' emerged last year, when Goldstein
and his wife, vacationing in Florida, paid $80 to record a birthday
tape instead of flying to Texas for a friend's party.
   Their 7-minute birthday spoof said: ``It's 83 degrees, the sun
is shining and we're on the Atlantic Ocean. You're a great guy,
Gil, but you ain't that great.''
   ``They rented a VCR and played it at the party. It was a
smash,'' said Goldstein.
   A month later, Goldstein read about a man who had designed a
video booth used in a California mall. Goldstein bought the patent
rights, jazzed up the design and went to market as Short Takes Inc.
   ``The pop-up cards they now have can retail from $5 to $9,''
said Goldstein. ``The growth in that specialty greeting card market
is so huge, I was convinced that people would spend $6 to $10
spontaneously'' on a video.
   So far, about 20 booths have been set up in bars, malls and
colleges in Minneapolis, Los Angeles and New York's South Street
Seaport. Goldstein said he's received inquiries about the booths
from around the country.
   ``It's a lot of fun,'' said Karen Munoz, who emerged _ laughing
_ from a Seaport booth with Michelle Davila. ``It's very
embarrassing if you do something stupid, though.''
   The women tried the booth Tuesday, liked it, and came back again
Wednesday.
   The first time was extemporaneous: ``We were busy laughing and
joking,'' said Ms. Munoz. The second time, they read ``news from
New York'' for friends in Virginia.
   Both women said they'd be back. Ms. Davila wants to send one to
her grandmother.
   The price varies, depending on the area. The 10-minute recording
tape, complete with mailer, is either issued by the machine or sold
at a nearby counter. It costs $16,000 for a tape-vending booth;
$14,000 if the tapes are sold separately, such as in a card shop.
   Goldstein's not just president of the company; he also uses the
machines.
   ``The other night, my wife and I sent a 10-minute tape to her
aunt in California. We brought our new baby into the booth with
us,'' said Goldstein. ``I had to put in the eight bucks _ I didn't
even get a discount.''
   Goldstein hopes for a video offspring to be used in maternity
wards. The projected name: ``Babytakes.''

<HEAD>TV Latest Battleground Between Solidarity, Gov't</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While Solidarity has plastered Poland with
campaign posters, the union faces tougher competition in promoting
its candidates on state television, where authorities still command
he airwaves.
   Solidarity receives 45 minutes of airtime weekly for its own
program, while the government has been using daily newscasts and
scores of special programs to promote its candidates.
   The union was assured access to state TV under the April 5
accords that legalized it in exchange for opposition support of
Poland's most democratic elections since World War II. The vote
will be held this Sunday.
   Problems with ``Studio Solidarnosc,'' as the opposition's TV
program is called, began almost immediately after Solidarity won
access to the one branch of the mass media where authorities still
had absolute control.
   First, according to Solidarity TV expert Kazimierz Zorowski,
authorities moved the show back a half-hour from the agreed-upon
time of 10 p.m. _ a late hour in a country where many people rise
early to commute to work.
   Attacks in the official press accusing Solidarity of overly
aggressive campaign tactics began after the first show May 9 in
which union spokesman Janusz Onyskiewicz told voters how to choose
Solidarity candidates and eliminate official ones.
   On May 23, authorities yanked a show containing a discussion of
human rights by a group of lawyers running on the Solidarity ticket
saying it ``violated limits which may not be crossed.''
   And viewers who tuned in at the scheduled 10:30 p.m. time
Tuesday to see Solidarity's program featuring a popular comedian
were treated to 18 minutes of unscheduled coverage of an election
rally with Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski. Solidarity's show
followed.
   ``I think it's a kind of panic on the part of the government
side,'' said Jacek Moskwa, secretary of the Solidarity Citizens
Committee that is organizing the union's campaign efforts.
   The government has defended its use of television.
   ``In the current world, state authorities must have at their
disposal a state television, which is their basic instrument of
contact with the society,'' said former government spokesman Jerzy
Urban, a veteran propagandist who last month was named the head of
the department of radio and television.
   In the last month, a group 20 journalists and technicians fired
from their jobs in state TV for pro-Solidarity sympathies after the
December 1981 martial-law crackdown have worked non-stop to create
programs from scratch.
   Authorities provided Solidarity with one camera and a crew, and
allows the union to work out of a room in the state broadcasting
complex. Despite the cramped quarters, the team isn't complaining.
   ``We haven't had any technical problems so far, said Zorawski,
who analyzes the content of both Solidarity and official programs.
``There is a big interest in our programs even though there isn't a
great interest in election campaign coverage in general.''
   The Solidarity shows mix light moments and strong doses of voter
education.
   Stevie Wonder was shown singing with campaign workers in Warsaw
election headquarters and Yves Montand charmed striking students at
Warsaw University.
   The shows also explain the complicated voting process. Each
voter will receive several cards with candidates whose affiliation
won't be indicated on the ballot. In order to choose a candidate, a
voter must cross off the other names.
   Two shows had long segments of well-known union activists
telling voters to remember Solidarity candidates and simply cross
out the rest.
   Since the instructions are consistent with election regulations,
there is little authorities can do except mount a counteroffensive.
   After Tuesday's program, an official commentator blasted
Solidarity for advising voters to reject official candidates who
helped negotiate the ``round-table'' agreements that led to the
elections.
   Although authorities dispose of hours of time each week,
official programs have shown little flair. Many of them simply
feature interviews with candidates whose party affiliation often is
unclear.
   Under an agreed-upon formula, state TV devotes 23 percent of its
election coverage to Solidarity-backed candidates.
   For instance, seven minutes of the daily half-hour show called
``Election Studio'' are produced by Solidarity crews and feature
the opposition's candidates being interviewed or speaking to voters.

<HEAD>European Papers Praise Bush Disarmament Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European papers offered President Bush unstinting
editorial praise for his disarmament proposals at the NATO summit
this week, but many noted that he only acted after Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev dominated the public opinion stage with his
proposals for several months.
   The dailies hailed Bush's call for speeded-up negotiations
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to slash conventional weapons
arsenals in Europe, as well as his compromise with West Germany to
negotiate eventually with the Soviets on cutting short-range
nuclear missiles.
   ``The agreement constituted an important step toward maintaining
NATO's unity in a moment when all Europe's defense strategies have
entered a period of profound revision,'' was the opinion of Spain's
El Pais.
   ``As such, perhaps the most important result of the Brussels
summit is that it served to ratify that the Bush administration,
after an excessively long period of indecision, has actively
incorporated the logic of disarmament begun by (Bush's)
predecessor.''
   The independent Belgian daily Le Soir, which before the summit
predicted it could end in ``disaster,'' commented:
   ``George Bush, the chief actor in this success ... brilliantly
took the lead of a reunited alliance which adopted a new program of
defense, disarmament and political action, with as main goal the
will to overcome the division of Europe and Germany.
   ``... In his first big foreign policy move, George Bush scored a
real master stroke,'' it added.
   In Amsterdam, the left-leaning Dutch de Volkskrant said ``the
image of George Bush as a president lacking a vision on the
development of the peace and disarmament process in Europe must be
corrected.''
   ``In an almost astonishing manner, Bush has succeeded in
averting painful failure at the summit. He has restored unity
within NATO and has shown himself as the leader of the western
alliance for the first time.''
   London's The Times, an independent daily, wrote that Bush ``has
proved an important point this week _ that he can change up a gear
when the international going demands it.''
   ``The main reassurance for the prime minister (Margaret
Thatcher) and for Britain must be that, at a time of approaching
crisis, the `drifting presidency' became a `directed presidency.'
   The Financial Times, also an independent British daily, said
Bush ``will be justified in looking back at the NATO summit as his
first important foreign policy success. After all the
procrastination of the past few months, Mr. Bush has regained the
initiative for NATO in the arms control debate and negotiations
dominated hitherto by Mr. Mikhail Gorbachev.''
   ``Arbeiderbladet'' of Oslo, which represents the ruling Labor
Party of Norwegian Prime Miniuster Gro Harlem Brundtland, praised
Bush for showing ``promising signs as president in his way of
handling the relations with Europe.''
   The Swiss independent paper ``Basler Zeitung'' wrote:
   ``The criticism of the U.S. president has somehow been unfair:
George Bush, as one knows, never was a man of bold visionary
proposals, he is a pragmatist through and through, reacting rather
than initiating policies.
   ``Bush's strength resides in that last point. He knows how to
wait, and when he reacts, he is usually well-prepared.''
   But a note of dissent was struck by another independent Swiss
daily, Le Matin, which said Bush ``has undoubtedly committed the
sin of excess optimism here. ... This charm operation runs the risk
of rapidly getting bogged down in the details of the Vienna
negotiations'' on reducing the conventional arsenals of NATO and
the Warsaw Pact.

   World leaders, environmentalists and
entertainers including Elton John, Sting, Herbie Hancock and Diana
Ross will appear on a global television show Saturday to heighten
awareness of environmental issues.
   The five-hour program, ``Our Common Future,'' will originate
from New York and pick up satellite feeds from London, Moscow,
Australia, Brazil, Tokyo and other locales.
   Organizers said the program will be broadcast to 100 countries.
   It is to feature recorded messages from world leaders such as
President Bush, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi, Chinese Premier Li Peng and Zimbabwean Prime Minister
Robert Mugabe.
   Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland will be host of
the program, being produced by the Swiss-based Centre for Our
Common Future and Uplinger Enterprises Inc. of Washington.
   Mrs. Brundtland was chairwoman of a U.N.-appointed commission
that spent three years gathering testimony and information to
compile a report on development and the world's environment.
   The report, also called ``Our Common Future,'' was an appraisal
of changes needed throughout the world to use available natural
resources in ways that ensure that future generations could do the
same.
   Organizers said Saturday's program is not a fund-raiser.
   Instead, they say, it is a consciousness-raising spectacle,
designed to take advantage of the world's growing concern over
environmental issues such as ozone depletion, global warming and
tropical rain forest destruction.
   Executive producer Hal Uplinger, who also produced the Live Aid
global benefit for African relief in 1985, said the program would
be available to 90 percent of the television sets in use throughout
the world.
   Sustainable development involves merging the world's needs to
develop economically and improve living standards for all its
people with protecting its resources and the environment for the
future.
   ``I think it's a very important event,'' Uplinger said. ``The
purpose is to get people to think about it and get involved.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite a loud outcry from many older
Americans, the Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday
urged Congress not to roll back the surtax that helps finance
catastrophic health insurance for retirees.
   Although preliminary estimates show the tax is bringing in more
revenue than had been expected, Secretary Louis W. Sullivan told
the Senate Finance Committee that is unlikely to continue once a
new prescription drug benefit goes into effect in 1991.
   ``More harm can be done by being overly optimistic about the
financing of these new benefits than by being prudently cautious,''
Sullivan said. ``The continuing implementation of catastrophic
health insurance under Medicare is the most appropriate course of
action.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee,
has suggested the unexpected revenue could be turned back to
retirees by reducing the catastrophic surtax by about 16 percent.
   The committee heard a bipartisan protest about the surtax _
which is paid only by higher-income elderly Americans _ from
members of Congress and disagreement among senior-citizen groups
about how to fix the problem.
   The catastrophic program is a meaningful improvement in
Medicare, said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``However, fairness cries
out to change the current way in which those benefits are funded.''
   If, after a flood of mail and phone calls, Congress still has
not concluded that elder Americans are unhappy with the program,
``You ain't seen nothin' yet,'' said Rep. Harris W. Fawell, R-Ill.
``When millions of seniors file their income tax returns next
April, there is going to be a popular revolt the likes of which
haven't been seen since the repeal of interest withholding seven
years ago.''
   Every person eligible for Medicare benefits _ including those
with private insurance _ is required to enroll in the catastrophic
program, which is aimed at reducing the possibility that an elderly
person could be ruined financially by an illness.
   Most of the program is financed by the income surtax, which is
paid only by older Americans whose incomes are enough that they owe
at least $150 in income tax. The maximum surtax this year is $800 a
person. About one-third of the cost is borne by a flat $4 monthly
fee on Medicare Part B (physician fees) enrollees.
   The surtax went into effect Jan. 1, but many of those who are
being hit by the levy will not pay it until they file their 1989
tax returns early next year.
   Even those for whom the law was enacted cannot agree on whether
it is good or bad.
   The National Council of Senior Citizens ``remains committed to
the implementation of the program and the preservation of the
benefits,'' said Executive Director Lawrence T. Smedley. ``We do,
however, continue to oppose the supplemental-premium (surtax)
financing mechanism.''
   ``Feelings of unfairness are mounting as elderly Americans
realize that about 40 percent of those 65 and older who pay income
taxes will foot the lion's share of the cost of Medicare
catastrophic protection, not just for themselves but for the 18
million Medicare eligibles who will not pay federal income taxes,''
said Thomas J. Kilcline, president of The Retired Officers
Association.
   The largest organization representing older Americans, the
American Association of Retired Persons, reminded the committee
that the program will provide some help to 75 percent to 85 percent
of Medicare beneficiaries over their lifetimes.
   ``AARP is opposed to any delay or repeal of the benefits in this
important act,'' said Lovola Burgess, a vice president. As for any
proposed changes in the financing mechanism, AARP ``will evaluate
them in light of their equity and potential for support.''
   ``There is a prairie fire of protest against this new law that
is spreading across this country,'' said H.T. Steve Morrisey,
president of the National Association of Retired Federal Employees.
``Simply put, seniors are saying it is a new tax and a bad buy.''
   Most federal retirees have no need of the program because they
are covered by a federal benefits plan, he said.
   The committee is considering several bills to delay or repeal
the entire program and to overhaul the financing provisions.

   There might be more congenial spots for
happily-ever-aftering, but the state prison in this pastoral town
is good enough, say theatrical inmates who are staging ``Camelot.''
   ``In order to survive in jail, you can't allow yourself too much
vulnerability,'' said Gordon Benjamin, 37, alias Lancelot. But
drama ``keeps people in touch with their feelings and the chance to
express them in an indirect way.''
   The Barrington, R.I., native could have left prison April 20 on
parole after nearly two years on a cocaine conviction. But he
decided to stay behind bars to play the romantic first knight of
the Round Table.
   Opening night is Friday and the production is expected to run
two to three weeks, Benjamin said Thursday. After that he plans to
leave prison. His future acting career is up in the air, he said.
   The inmates in the cast, including some from a nearby women's
prison, call themselves the ``Awesome Convict Players.'' During a
dress rehearsal this week, they showed off the scenery they
painted, the addition to the stage they built and the tunics and
robes they stitched under the tutelage of a volunteer costume
mistress.
   ``Camelot'' is costing less than $500 to produce with support by
a grant from Massachusetts Citizens Against the Death Penalty, said
Jim Kelley, community service director for the prison. The cast
will give performances for fellow inmates, town residents, staff
and state dignitaries, and on closing night, for family and friends.
   A converted reform school, the minimum-security prison about 40
miles northwest of Boston is used to reintegrate into the community
inmates soon to be released. Many committed drug and alcohol
offenses, but some were in prison for violent crimes.
   There are no bars, fences or guard dogs. Prisoners so close to
freedom seldom try to escape.
   ``I'm sure from the outside it seems funny because `Camelot' is
supposed to be a perfect world, and doing it in a prison is such an
irony,'' said Holly Ward, the 28-year-old director.
   But prison theater is therapeutic, she said. The inmates agreed.
   ``When you lose your freedom, you reevaluate everything,'' said
one actor inmate, who requested anonymity. ``Camelot is a way to
reassess your dreams and maybe to live out your dreams in some
way.''
   Ward said her biggest problem is actors who win release just
when they've mastered their roles. ``We've been through three
Arthurs and several Merlins and several Mordreds.''
   But Ward and Kelley said they were stunned when Benjamin
postponed his own parole so he could go on with the show.
   ``I've never seen a parole put off for this,'' Kelley said.
``That's major.''
   Ward began organizing inmate plays when she was a theater arts
student seven years ago.
   Several years ago, she directed ``Man of La Mancha'' at Norfolk
prison and persuaded actor Richard Kiley, who played Don Quixote on
Broadway, to attend. This time she has invited Robert Goulet, who
played Lancelot in the film version of ``Camelot.''
   ``We're hoping he's going to make it,'' Ward said.
   Acting helps inmates develop self-esteem and perspective on
their feelings, she said.
   ``Some of them, I have to teach them how to cry,'' she said.
``Then I have to teach them how to stop.''

   A 14th-century painted Chinese handscroll was
sold at auction Thursday for $1.87 million, more than triple the
previous record for a Chinese painting, Christie's auction house
said.
   ``The Imperial Autumn Hunting Party'' was purchased by My Humble
House of Taipei, an Oriental artifacts dealer, said spokeswoman
Doris Athineos. The price included Christie's 10 percent commission.
   The scroll, which Christie's said was ``most likely executed by
a Chinese artist working in the Mongol court,'' is nearly two feet
wide and 40 feet long. It shows the Yuan emperor and his hunting
party on a hilly landscape.
   The previous auction record for a Chinese painting was $539,000
for Zaho Meng Fu's ``Thousand Character Poem,'' Ms. Athineos said.

   A man wanted since 1971 in the shooting
death of his wife, 85-year-old mother and three children has been
arrested, authorities said today.
   John List was arrested in Richmond, Va., Westfield Police Chief
Anthony Scutti said. His case was featured last weekend on the
network television program ``America's Most Wanted.'' Since the
broadcast, tips have been coming in to police headquarters, Scutti
said.
   ``From what I understand he's denying it, but they've checked
his fingerprints and it's postive,'' Scutti said.
   FBI Agent Drucilla Wells declined to give details of List's
arrest until an afternoon news conference in Newark.
   On the night of Dec. 7, 1971, neighbors noticed that light bulbs
were going out in the List's Westfield home. For a month, no one
had heard anything from the List family _ Patricia, 16, John Jr.
15, Frederick, 13, List's 45-year-old wife, Helen, and his mother
Alma.
   The city's former police chief, James Moran, said he expected
List to be caught only after the case became nationally known
through television or the newspapers. Moran said he still carries a
wanted poster of List with him.
   ``I'll gladly tear it up now,'' he said.

   A man found with $69,950 in his luggage at an
airport is trying to get they money back from authorities, along
with $50,000 in damages.
   Lt. Peter J. Misko, leader of the Milwaukee County Sheriff's
Drug Enforcement Unit, said deputies searched John L. Taylor Jr.'s
bag March 15 at Mitchell International Airport after it was singled
out by drug-sniffing dogs. They seized the cash, gave him a receipt
and let him fly home to Los Angeles. He was not charged with any
crime.
   ``The drug dogs hit right on the money, so we know whoever was
handling the money was handling drugs,'' Misko said.
   Taylor's attorney, Alvin R. Ugent, said his client contends a
deputy ``jerked the dog's head'' toward the suitcase. Ungent said
Taylor, 51, said the money was working capital for a company he
owns that sells ventilation equipment.
   Ugent filed a claim Wednesday against the county and Sheriff
Richard E. Artison, seeking return of the money and damages.
   Misko said the money was turned over to the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration. The government can seize assets when
officers have probable cause to believe the assets are connected to
illegal drug trafficking, said Kelly Snyder, agent in charge of the

<HEAD>FDA Approves ``Orphan'' Drug for Anemia Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A genetically engineered drug that can help
reduce anemia in patients suffering from kidney failure and may
also benefit cancer and AIDS patients was approved Thursday by the
Food and Drug Administration.
   ``My life has been changed dramatically,'' said John G. Cole of
Avon Lake, Ohio, who took part in the clinical trials of the drug
epoetin.
   The new drug is a copy of a natural human protein,
erythropoietin, which stimulates the body to produce red blood
cells.
   Lack of those cells, which carry energy-giving oxygen around the
body, is known as anemia. And since the kidneys produce
erythropoietin, patients with kidney failure often develop anemia.
   Food and Drug Commissioner Frank Young said that in addition to
about 95,000 kidney patients who should benefit from the new drug,
it also may be useful to chronically anemic patients suffering from
other diseases, such as cancer and AIDS.
   The approval announced Thursday was aimed at kidney patients,
and the drug was developed under the orphan drug program which
gives companies financial encouragement to produce products to
benefit relatively small numbers of people, generally fewer than
200,000.
   But once approved for sale, physicians may use a drug for other
purposes.
   Cole, an editor at The Journal in Lorain, Ohio, described the
drug as ``great stuff.''
   Before entering the program, Cole said, ``taking the trash out
was a difficult trip down the driveway'' and a walk on the beach
entailed asking his wife to wait for him.
   Now, he said, he no longer requires weekly blood transfusions in
addition to his dialysis, exercises three times a week, walks on
the beach and works 50 to 55 hours a week.
   ``I'm never going to be able to play full-court basketball, my
disease has limitations, but I can play a hell of a game of
half-court,'' he commented.
   Young explained that anemia in most kidney patients has been
treated by transfusions, which results in ``ups and downs'' in
their energy levels. In addition, while blood is screened, their
remains the small possibility of infection from blood.
   With epoetin, the body produces its own red cells, keeping
energy at a constant level and avoiding the need for transfusions
in 95 percent of patients, he said.
   The drug was developed in 1983 and the only problems reported in
trials were those already seen in kidney failure patients who did
not get the drug, high blood pressure, headache, chest pain and in
some patients siezures.
   Epoetin will be marketed by Amgen of Thousand Oaks, Calif.,
under the trade name Epogen. Amgen said a typical patient will
receive injections of the drug three times a week. The cost will
range between $4,000 and $8,000 annually, the company said.
   Young said a decision on whether the drug will be covered by
federal assistance programs is under discussion.
   Epoetin is produced by inserting the human gene which causes
production of erythropoietin into Chinese hamster ovary cells.
These cells then produce large amounts of epoetin, Young said.
   A slightly different drug for the same use is also under
development in a joint effort by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Japan
and the Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich., Young said.

   About 120 demonstrators marched and chanted
against U.S. policy in El Salvador on Thursday and nearly half were
arrested for stopping traffic or blocking a building where Sen.
Daniel P. Moynihan has an office.
   The protesters gathered at the Salvadoran consulate in Manhattan
and spattered its wall with red paint. They marched to Moynihan's
New York City office, but he was in Washington and the protesters
were not admitted to the building.
   Police said 12 people were charged with disorderly conduct for
blocking the building entrance and 37 for halting traffic.
   The demonstration was sponsored by the New York Coalition to
Stop the U.S. War in El Salvador, which said it targeted Moynihan,
a Democrat, because ``he has the power to make a difference, but
instead he supports the murderous status quo.''

<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani
took over from Jose Napoleon Duarte today and promptly offered to
open talks with guerrillas who have been fighting the government
for nine years.
   During his inaugural address, Cristiani said: ``The process of
dialogue will not be simple, but we are willing to initiate it
immediately.''
   Cristiani, whose right-wing political party has been linked to
death squads that have killed thousands of civilians, said: ``We
are not asking for anyone's surrender, but neither will we endure a
terrorist war against the economy and against the people.''
   It was the first transfer of power from one elected head of
state to another in El Salvador.
   Soldiers patrolled the capital and roads were deserted after
Marxist guerrillas, who recently threatened to make the country
``ungovernable,'' ordered a ban on transportation and set off bombs
to protest the inauguration.
   Cristiani, whose political party is blamed for poor living
conditions of the peasants who make up most of El Salvador's
population, said:
   ``Our government will be based fundamentally on the principles
of liberty, honesty, legality and security.''
   Cristiani said he was taking office after ``a long period of
anguish and need'' in El Salvador. The roots of El Salvador's
problems are old, he said, ``but ... sharpened by internal and
external forces.''
   Cristiani, 41, a U.S.-educated coffee grower, was elected March
19. Voter turnout was the lowest in a decade, which was partly
attributed to a ban on traffic ordered by the rebel Farabundo
National Liberation Front, which has been fighting a nine-year war
with the U.S.-backed government.
   Cristiani's right-wing Republican National Alliance, or Arena,
was founded in 1981 by a cashiered army major and alleged
death-squad kingpin, Roberto D'Aubuisson. He still is hailed by
stalwarts as the party's ``maximum leader.''
   Death squads are blamed for up to half the 70,000 deaths in the
civil war, but D'Aubuisson and Arena deny any connection to the
squads.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher today praised the
transfer of power, saying it reflected the ``strong commitment of
the people of El Salvador to democracy.''
   More than 6,000 people attended the ceremony. They included
delegates from 36 nations, including the United States.
   Ricardo Alvarenga Valdivieso, president of the Legislative
Assembly, placed the presidential sash on Cristiani, who then took
the oath of office.
   The guerrillas have heralded Cristiani with nightly 21-bomb
salutes, blowing up power lines and utility poles at a pace
unmatched in recent years. They threatened to make the country
``ungovernable.''
   Officials at the state power company said guerrillas bombed
transmission towers Wednesday night, knocking out power in 90
percent of the country.
   On Wednesday, the rebels called an indefinite traffic ban, and
bus dispatchers said it was a success. Most of the country's 5.5
million people rely on buses to get around.
   This morning, streets in the capital were empty.
   The transport ban has been a favorite tactic of rebels, who
threaten to shoot at or set fire to cars or buses on the roads.
   Also Wednesday, troops in the capital seized a cache of rebel
weapons. Police said they netted 350 Soviet rifles, 300 sticks of
dynamite and 1.5 million bullets.
   El Salvador is the most densely populated country in the Western
Hemisphere. Infant mortality, contaminated drinking water,
illiteracy and lack of roads and electricity plague its many
peasant farmers.
   The Salvadoran economy would be virtually bankrupt were it not
for the $1 million per day in economic and military aid provided by
Washington. U.S. officials have expressed concern about an eventual
rise in illegal detentions, torture and summary executions under
Arena.
   Cristiani's first hurdle is convincing Salvadorans and the
international community that he is in charge as he claims to be.
But Arena opponents, and even some party insiders, say Cristiani is
a front man.
   Arena in its early days was a political branch of the landed
elite _ those who made fortunes growing and exporting coffee,
cotton and sugar cane in a semi-feudal system that left the vast
majority in poverty.
   The pillars of that system have been eroded in five years of
reformist Christian Democratic government. Duarte, though he failed
to end the war and promote prosperity, is generally credited with
having begun the foundation of incipient democracy.
   Politically motivated killings are far fewer than when Duarte
took office in 1984. Non-combatant leftists can now organize labor
unions and express themselves politically at considerably less risk
of being killed.
   Duarte, who is dying of liver cancer, is concerned his efforts
on behalf of democracy will be undone.
   ``There may be differences between Cristiani and D'Aubuisson as
individuals, but they both support a totalitarian project and they
both favor an economic policy that benefits the rich,'' he told The
Associated Press on Monday during a farewell cocktail at the
Presidential Palace.

   Two construction company workers were
overcome by gases while working on a sewer project, and both died,
police said. One died trying to rescue the other.
   The men were removing debris from one of the city's new sewer
pumps in an 18-foot-deep sump Wednesday afternoon, said Public
Works Director Jack Cubbedge.
   When one man was overcome and passed out, the other tried to
flag down motorists before climbing into the well to rescue his
co-worker, said Sgt. Steve Fricke.
   When a fire-rescue team arrived, neither man was breathing.
   Cubbedge said the men worked for Satilla Industrial Contractors
of Waycross, Ga., a subcontractor on the sewer project. They were
identified as Percy Cummings, 28, of Lake City, and Ronny Clifford
Odom, 40, of Metter, Ga.

<HEAD>Anti-Government Hunger Strike Enters Second Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-government hunger strike at
Seoul's Roman Catholic cathedral entered its second week Thursday
with protesters vowing to continue the fast until police admit they
killed a student leader.
   Dozens of hunger strikers outside Myongdong Cathedral shouted
slogans against President Roh Tae-woo. The fasters were blocked by
lines of riot police outside, while hundreds of other protesters
rested or engaged in discussions in the compound.
   In the eastern provincial capital of Chunchon, about 500
rock-throwing students fought riot police who lashed out with
bamboo sticks. At least 10 students and police were injured, the
South Korean news agency Yonhap reported.
   Dissidents and radical students have staged protests to denounce
the government over the death of Lee Chol-kyu, a student whose body
was found May 10 in a reservoir outside the southern city of
Kwangju.
   Dissidents contend police tortured and killed Lee. The
opposition-controlled National Assembly launched a parliamentary
investigation into Lee's death Thursday and dispatched lawmakers to
Kwangju.
   A government report has concluded Lee slipped and fell into the
reservoir after fleeing a police roadblock. Prosecutors said they
found no evidence of torture.
   Student leaders said 436 students and dissidents were fasting
Thursday at the cathedral. Since about 300 students began the
hunger strike May 25, 14 had been hospitalized, with more joining
the fast this week, the leaders said.
   Thousands of riot police have maintained tight security around
the church and on nearby roads, turning away students.
   On Wednesday, police arrested about 600 students who tried to
march to the cathedral. Most of the arrested students had been
released after questioning, police said.
   Students said the cathedral protest is based on the same tactics
used by Chinese students in protests in Beijing.
   Radical student leaders have been trying to switch to peaceful
protests after six riot troopers were killed May 3 in a campus
clash. The deaths triggered public outrage.
   On Thursday, prosecutors indicted 69 students on charges related
to the killing of the police officers.

   A man whose wife was jailed after he took their
4-year-old son from a hospital where he was undergoing
court-ordered treatment for leukemia surrendered with the boy
today, police said.
   Family Court Judge Leon Deutsch gave David Pagan a suspended
10-day sentence, released his wife, Migdalia, and placed their son
back in the custody of child welfare authorities.
   Deutsch gave the parents unlimited visitation rights at the
hospital but said they must be accompanied by a city or hospital
official to prevent them from removing Darian Pagan again.
   Pagan, 36, took his son from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Hospital sometime Sunday, police said. The boy was undergoing
court-ordered treatment for leukemia.
   Darian was hospitalized Friday under an order from Deutsch that
was requested by the city's Child Welfare Administration because
hospital officials said the boy was not getting the treatment he
needed.
   Mrs. Pagan was jailed the last two nights on contempt of court
charges for refusing to tell the court where her husband and child
were.
   Pagan walked into Family Court around noon today. The husband
and wife appeared before the judge. The child was in the
courthouse, but not in the courtroom.
   The couple's attorney, Steven Mandel, said the father had
removed the child from the hospital and was taking him to the
Anderson Medical and Tumor Institute, which is affiliated with the
University of Texas in Houston.
   He did not say how far the two had traveled or what prompted
their return.
   Speaking of the parents, the judge said: ``They have violated
the order of the court and potentially harmed the child. They may
well have placed this child in jeopardy.''
   After giving Pagan the 10-day suspended sentence, he added,
``The mother has been punished. I will order her released.''
   Mandel said that when hospital officials went to the city
agency, doctors said Darian was in ``imminent danger'' if he did
not receive a radical form of radiation and chemotherapy.
   The parents were upset because no such treatment was
administered between Friday, when the boy was admitted, and Sunday,
when he was taken from the hospital, Mandel said.
   The Pagans are Jehovah's Witnesses, a religion that opposes
blood transfusions. Mandel said their religion did not play a part
in the court case.
   He said the child had received much medical care and treatment
for leukemia since he was diagnosed at age 2.

   The U.S. military called off its search Thursday
for 13 Marines and a sailor missing after their helicopter plunged
upside down into the sea during a training exercise near Okinawa.
   Seven other Marines and a sailor aboard the helicopter were
rescued after the CH-46 Sea Knight, based at Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii,
crashed Tuesday night shortly after taking off from the USS Denver.
   Four of the survivors were ``stable and in good condition'' at
Camp Lester Hospital in Okinawa, said Maj. Kerry Gershaneck, public
affairs officer of the Marine Corps Air Station at Kaneohe Bay. The
other four were treated and released.
   By Thursday, the search for the missing men off Kiyan Cape had
yielded only four pieces of metal, all believed to be from the
helicopter.
   Japan reduced its search for the missing at noon Thursday from
seven boats and two aircraft to one vessel due to the decreased
possibility of survivors, said Kazuhiro Sameshima, spokesman for
the Okinawa office of the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast
guard.
   The helicopter disappeared at about 11:55 p.m. Tuesday.
   Lt. Col. Fred Peck, Marine Corps spokesman in Washington, said
it ``pitched over to the right and went into the water inverted,
upside down. I have nothing to indicate why it did that.''
   Capt. Lenny Ryan, a spokesman at the Kaneohe Marine Corps Air
Station, said the pilot was not wearing night-vision goggles, which
significantly enhance vision by amplifying light.
   There is no requirement that night-vision goggles be worn during
night operations, and Gershaneck refused comment on whether the
lack of goggles might have contributed to the crash.
   He said an investigation into the cause of the crash was
continuing, but he was not sure if the survivors had been
questioned.
   Master Sgt. Jake Rodrigues, spokesman for U.S. Forces in Japan,
said the 22-year-old helicopter carried a crew of four and 18
passengers assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment,
Okinawa.
   Missing and presumed dead were: Capt. John J. Vela Jr., 27, of
Humble, Texas; 1st Lt. Roger D. Peters, 27, of Orinda, Calif.; 1st
Lt. Martin C. Rawley, 24, of Kirkland, Wash.; Sgt. David A. Woomer,
25, of West Chicago, Ill.; Lance Cpl. Michael T. Bogucki, 23, of
Burr Oak, Mich.; Lance Cpl. Raymond L. Dallimore, 20, of Reno,
Nev.; Lance Cpl. Jeffrey S. Fulton, 22, of Brinnon, Wash.; Lance
Cpl. John C. Graves Jr., 21, of Pasadena, Texas; Lance Cpl. Charles
E. McCadd, 20, of Chicago; Lance Cpl. Ronald D. North, 20, of St.
Petersburg, Fla.; Cpl. Paul J. Barker, 24, of Shelton, Wash.; Cpl.
Carter W. Collings, 21, of Covina, Calif.; Cpl. Patrick A. Poe, 23,
of Little Rock, Ark. and Navy Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Tim
Renaldo, 25, of Huntington Beach, Calif.
   Those hospitalized were Lance Cpl. Keith A. Brower, 20, of
Washoe County, Nevada; Lance Cpl. Marvin T. Cook, 22, of Bonneville
County, Idaho; Cpl. George S. Sanchez, 20, of Denton County, Texas;
and Pfc. Jason S. Wiggins, 18, of Ouachita Parish, La., Gershaneck
said.
   The men treated and released were identified as Sgt. John R.
Becker, 24, of St. Tammany Parish, La.; Lance Cpl. David M.
Fleming-Jones, 19, of Pierce County, Wash.; Cpl. William R. West,
22, of Jefferson County, Colo.; and Navy Hospitalman 3d Class J.K.
Largent, 23, of Barboursville County, W.Va.
   It was the third crash of a U.S. military helicopter in East
Asia this year.
   Nineteen Marines were killed and 16 injured March 20 when a
CH-53D Sea Stallion crashed, and four were killed March 17 in the
crash of a CH-46. Both helicopters went down in South Korea during
joint military exercises and the causes have not been announced.
   About 64,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan under a mutual
security pact, 35,000 of them on Okinawa.

   High interest rates continued their assault on
private construction in April, but the government said Thursday
that total construction spending rose a weak 0.1 percent due to an
upturn in work on public projects.
   The Commerce Department reported a total increase in new
spending to $414.9 billion on a seasonally adjusted annual rate
after declines of three consecutive months. That was 4.7 percent
above a year earlier.
   The last time construction spending fell for three straight
months had been just before the start of the 1981-82 recession when
it dropped from February through June 1981.
   Private construction fell 1.2 percent in April as the building
pace dropped 0.2 percent for residential buildings and 4.8 percent
for nonresidential structures.
   Public construction on the other hand, was up 5.7 percent, due
in large part to an 8.9 percent increase in highway and street
improvements.
   ``Neither of these movements was surprising,'' said David
Bersen, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association.
   ``We should see some continued weakness in private construction
in both residential and nonresidential building because of the
effects of higher mortgage rates and higher interest rates in
general in the first quarter of the year,'' he said.
   The high interest rates have been brought about by Federal
Reserve efforts to tighten credit in an effort to slow the economy
and thus stem inflation.
   The number of new housing units being built was off 1.3 percent
to an annual rate of $141.8 billion after a 1.2 percent fall in
March. Sepnding on single-family homes dropped 2.3 percent, while
construction of multi-family homes rose 2.9 percent.
   The only increase in the nonresidential category was for
industrial spending, up 1.9 percent.
   ``Industrial building should be up because capacity utilization
is very tight in a number of industries,'' Bersen said. ``The
demand for goods has been pretty strong, particularly for exports,
and firms should be increasing their industrial capacity.''
   Bersen also found the 2.3 percent decline in office building
unsurprising because, in addition to higher interest rates, ``there
is still in a number of cities ... a glut in office buildings.''
   While public construction totaled a seasonallyadjusted $79.3
billion in April, Bersen said he expects it to slow in coming
months ``because government spending at all levels is slowing.''
   ``The only reason that public construction should have gone up
in April as it did was that there was a sharp drop in March,'' he
said. ``And the march drop was reeally below the trend.''
   Public construction fell 8.5 percent in March.

   Workers at the state-run Spanish television
began a 24-hour strike for better pay Thursday, cancelling
programming for only the second time since broadcasting began in
1956.
   Thousands of rail passengers, meanwhile, braced for a one-day
strike Friday at the state-controlled rail system as its 63,000
employees continued a long-running battle with management for
better pay.
   The strikes formed part of a six-month battle for higher pay by
employees of state enterprises who oppose the Socialist
administration's efforts to keep pay increases moderate to contain
inflation that is running at a 6.7 percent annually.
   A rail spokeswoman guaranteed service on four international
routes _ Madrid-Paris, Barcelona-Paris, Barcelona-Bern,
Switzerland, and Barcelona-Geneva _ as well as 19 night trains to
and from major provincial capitals.
   On Friday, between 50 percent and 75 percent of regular commuter
trains would be in service and only during rush hours, the railway
said.
   Television union official Joaquin Aguilar said Thursday the only
broadcasts would be four, 20-minute news segments, followed by
obligatory public service campaign spots for the June 15 European
parliamentary elections and an hour of children's cartoons.
   The only previous 24-hour TV strike in Spain came Dec. 14, when
Socialist and Communist unions carried out a general strike to
pressure the government of Socialist Prime Minister to make a
leftward shift away from inflation-fighting economic austerity
policies to greatly increase social spending.

   Even in the heat of a
championship squash match, Alfredo ``Fredy'' Cristiani, the
empitome of good sportsmanship, never lost his temper or
gentlemanly grace.
   It is that suaveness and composure that helped the former
standout athlete win the presidency, which he took over Thursday
from Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   The 41-year-old U.S.-educated businessman is a public relations
dream-come-true for his rightist party, the Republican Nationalist
Alliance.
   From its inception in 1981, the party _ known as a Arena _
developed a neo-fascist image and a reputation for murder.
   It was founded by cashiered army intelligence Maj. Roberto
D'Aubuisson, whom U.S. officials, human rights groups and the Roman
Catholic Church have linked to rightist death squads that killed
thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s.
   When D'Aubuisson lost the presidential election to Duarte in
1984, it became evident that Arena needed refurbishing if the right
were to regain the power it exercised during previous decades in
alliance with the armed forces.
   D'Aubuisson ceded the party presidency to Cristiani, an urbane
and strapping coffee-grower and pharmaceutical distributor.
   ``Be assured that I entered politics only because of the
country's grave crisis, and not motivated by personal ambition,''
Cristiani said in radio spots during the campaign for the March 19
election.
   ``I'd rather be running my business or deep-sea fishing,'' he
said in an interview last year.
   What remains to be seen is whether the accomplished sportsman _
he was national squash champion through most of the 1970s, a
national motocross champ and a member of the national volleyball
team _ has the final word on government policy.
   He says he is in charge. Opponents of Arena doubt it, however.
They say he is little more than a palatable front for what remains
a totalitarian party.
   But a friend and former courtmate said: ``Fredy is no pushover.
Pushovers don't become champion athletes.''
   Cristiani graduated from Washington's Georgetown University in
1968 with a degree in business administration.
   He is married to Margarita Llach, a member of one of the
country's most aristocratic families. They have three children
ranging in age from 14 to 18 years old.
   Cristiani also is connected by marriage to the military elite.
His wife's sister is married to outgoing Defense Minister Gen.
Eugenio Vides Casanova.

<HEAD>U.S. Criticizes Cuba on Captured Equipment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Thursday the capture
of ammunition alleged to have been supplied by Cuba to leftist
guerrillas in El Salvador contradicts Cuba's stated support for the
Central American peace process.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said that among the items
seized by government forces on Tuesday was 1 million rounds of
ammunition bearing stamps indicating they were made in Cuba.
   The cache was found following a tip from a captured member of
the FMLN guerrillas. It was described by Salvadoran military
leaders as the largest cache of insurgent weapons ever captured.
   The discovery, Boucher said, ``belies Cuba's assertion of
support'' for regional peace agreements that reaffirm the principal
of non-interference in the internal affairs of Central American
nations.
   Boucher said the cache also included 283 Soviet AK47 assault
rifles, hundreds of other Soviet bloc weapons and material for the
manufacture of explosive devices, including 892 one-pound blocks of
TNT.
   ``These weapons were to be used to commit terrorist acts against
the people of El Salvador,'' Boucher said.
   Other officials, asking not to be identified, said the captured
FMLN guerrilla had told Salvadoran authorities that the weapons
were sent from Nicaragua to El Salvador on refrigerated trucks.
   The officials said that such transportation was used presumably
to minimize the possibility that the explosive devices would
detonate in the hot weather.
   While the ammunition appeared to be of Cuban origin, the point
of departure of the other equipment was not clear, the officials
said.
   They added, however, that past patterns have been that the
weapons are sent to the rebels from Cuba by way of Nicaragua.
   As Boucher spoke, Aldredo Cristiani was sworn in to a five-year
term as president of El Salvador, succeeding Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   Boucher said the United States continues to support the
consolidation in El Salvador of a democracy in which ``security
flows from respect for human rights, the rule of law and equitable
development.
   ``We applaud President Cristiani's firm commitment to these
goals,'' he said.
   Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a former chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, headed the U.S. delegation to
the inaugural.
   Vice President Dan Quayle plans a visit to El Salvador and three
other Central American countries later this month.

   A warning to boaters about stormy
weather on Chesapeake Bay wasn't transmitted until after the storm,
which killed at least one person, Coast Guard and National Weather
Service officials say.
   The warning may have been stuck in a computer in Virginia and
been delayed because of a computer error, officials said Wednesday.
   The weather service issued its first bulletin at 10:44 a.m.
Saturday, warning boaters of storms and gale-force gusts
approaching from the west at 40 mph. At 12:30 p.m., the warning
area was extended.
   But the first bulletin was not relayed to Coast Guard
installations on the bay and the second bulletin was not circulated
until 1:30 p.m., Coast Guard and weather service officials said. By
then, the storm had passed.
   A Kent County man is missing and presumed drowned, and a New
Jersey man drowned when his boat capsized near Fortescue, N.J.
   Marian Peleski, a weather service meteorologist at New Castle
County Airport, said she was told by a computer programmer at the
Coast Guard's 5th District station in Portsmouth, Va., that the
bulletin was rejected by the communication computer. Peleski said
she was told that when the computer was repaired last winter,
programmers forgot to instruct the system to receive and relay such
bulletins.
   Petty Officer First Class Rick Woods, a 5th District spokesman,
said an investigation is under way.
   ``It could have been a computer error,'' Woods said. ``The tempo
of activity or an overload of the circuits could have caused the
communication failure.''

<HEAD>World Bank to Lend $10 Billion to Cut Third World Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of 151 governments in the
World Bank will make about $10 billion available over the next
three years to support Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's plan
for cutting debt in the Third World, bank spokesman Frank Vogl
estimated Thursday.
   ``Amounts for particular countries haven't been worked out yet
because our board is going to consider three-year programs for the
first time,'' he added.
   He said the 22 members on the Boards of Executive Directors soon
will consider a one-year package of $1.5 billion in loans to Mexico.
   Under guidelines announced Thursday after more than two days of
closed-door board meetings, $375 million of that new money will be
available to apply to Mexico's existing $108 billion debt.
   The loans from the bank could help Mexico settle old debt at a
discount. Another use would be to persuade the private banks that
hold most of it to write off a part, in return for assurances that
interest will be paid on the rest.
   The World Bank issued a statement quoting its president, Barber
Conable, as saying the member countries were in ``broad agreement''
on the percentages of its loans that could be set aside for debt
relief. The World Bank approved more than $19 billion in loans last
year.
   Each case will be handled separately, Conable said. He added
that the set-aside would be about 25 percent of ``adjustment
lending.'' This is the kind of lending which, like the loans
planned for Mexico, require the borrowing government to make
promises about new policies. He added that for countries where the
bank is concentrating on its traditional loans for specific
prjects, such as roads and schools, the figure would be 10 percent
of the total lending.
   Both figures would cover a three-year period.
   The directors agreed that in some cases an additional 15 percent
of the World Bank's lending could be made available to reduce a
country's debt and payments.
   Third World debt totals about $1.2 trillion, about 60 percent
owed to commercial banks and the rest to governments and
intergovernment agencies like the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund. A similar policy of set-asides was announced last
week by the fund, the bank's sister organization.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Childless couples in which the man is infertile
could have a new chance to raise a family because of a surgical
technique that opens a microscopic gateway to the human egg.
   The procedure, called partial zona dissection, or PZD, involves
extracting eggs from a woman and making a tiny incision to help the
sperm enter.
   It has been tried at 12 infertility clinics worldwide, but the
only documented success has occurred at Reproductive Biology
Associates of Atlanta, a private company working with the Emory
University Medical School Center for Infertility.
   Dr. Jacques Cohen, the company's scientific director, said of
the 27 women he has treated during the past year seven became
pregnant and four of those have delivered babies _ including two
sets of twins. The three others are still pregnant.
   Cohen is not ready to claim that the technique is the answer for
infertile men, who make up 40 percent of all infertility cases. But
he said it offers new hope for many.
   ``I think it's a first step in the right direction,'' Cohen said
Wednesday. ``I think it's the biggest breakthrough in years in male
infertility treatment.''
   The work has yet to be published in a medical journal, but an
independent fertility expert agreed it has wide-ranging
implications.
   ``This is still a procedure that's in early development. But I'm
very enthusiastic about it,'' said Dr. Zev Rosenwacks, director of
Cornell University's Center of Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility. ``I think it's a breakthrough.''
   Dr. John Gordon, whose published research on mice eggs at Mount
Sinai Hospital in New York laid the groundwork for Cohen's work,
said, ``I think this is going to be a major component of treatment
for infertility in years to come.''
   In vitro fertilization _ in which eggs are extracted from a
woman's body and united with sperm in a laboratory, then replaced
in the womb to grow to maturity _ has been available for humans
since its development in 1978 in Great Britain. Since then, about
15,000 ``test tube'' babies have been born worldwide, according to
the American Fertility Society.
   But that work has been largely unsuccessful with male
infertility. The key to PZD is that immobile or malformed sperm, or
sperm in counts normally too few for successful fertilization, can
gain access to the egg, said Cohen, who developed the procedure
along with Dr. Henry Malter and a research team.
   PZD, which costs about $7,000 for each treatment, involves
placing the eggs in a sucrose solution to shrink them so the
delicate interior is protected. The egg is smaller than the head of
a pin.
   Using a tiny pipette and needle, the outer wall of the egg is
pierced in two places and a small incision is made. The egg is
allowed to expand again, and is mixed with sperm.
   Diane Geheber of Atlanta, who underwent the procedure last
summer, gave birth to a baby boy on April 30, six years after she
and her husband, Fred, first looked into in vitro fertilization as
an answer to their fertility problems. They tried PZD after other
attempts failed.
   ``I knew it was experimental, but I didn't want to wait,'' Mrs.
Geheber said Wednesday. ``I wanted to go ahead and pull out all the
stops. It takes some people years and years and then they find out
they could have done something about it.''
   There are some problems with the PZD method. Cohen said it is
difficult to control the number of sperm that enter a given egg
once a hole is made in its outer wall. When more than one enters,
the egg is genetically abnormal and the resulting embryo dies. That
has happened in about 25 percent of PZD cases.
   The researchers don't expect a problem with multiple births, and
the significance of the two sets of twins remains unknown.
   In addition, men whose sperm has several abnormalities probably
won't be helped by PZD, Cohen said.
   But the development means some infertile couples have another
opportunity to raise a family.
   ``We're really excited and we consider ourselves very, very
lucky,'' said Mrs. Geheber. ``A lot of people go through it a
number of times and still don't have children.''

<TEXT>
   The ports along the Oxus River in
far northern Afghanistan are the government's lifeline, and the
mounds of wheat and barrels of cooking oil are a constant reminder
of its debt to the Soviet Union.
   The settlement of 5,000 people along the banks of the river that
divides the Soviet Union and Afghanistan didn't exist until six
years ago. The four ports in Hayratan store 162,000 tons of food
and other supplies essential to embattled southern cities,
including the capital, Kabul.
   Without the supplies, the nation faces desperate shortages of
food and fuel brought on by the 11-year-old war between the
Soviet-backed regime and the Moslem guerrillas.
   ``When you see that all the requirements of the people of
Afghanistan come from the Soviet Union, you have to be proud of the
ties with Moscow and strengthen them,'' said Mohebullah Sediq,
governor of Hayratan.
   The Oxus divides Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Spanning the
river is Friendship Bridge, which the last of the Soviet troops
crossed on Feb. 15 to end a nine-year military intervention.
   But the Kremlin still ships hundreds of tons of supplies to
Kabul daily. Some travel by barge or rail and transferred to
trucks, while others arrive by plane.
   Afghanistan was self-sufficient in food before the civil war,
but the fighting has destroyed fields and orchards and forced the
government to import almost all its food.
   Soviet assistance, particularly weapons and ammunition, has
enabled the government of President Najib to hold its ground since
the Red Army left. With no apparent end in sight to the civil war,
however, it is uncertain how long the aid will continue.
   As many as 50 Soviet military transport planes descend daily on
the capital, bringing food, weapons and ammunition.
   Trucks rumble 360 miles down the Salang highway through the
Hindu Kush mountains to Kabul, a city of 2.25 million people.
   During the bitter winter, supply convoys from the border often
were blocked by guerrillas, but most relief agencies say trucks are
reaching the capital now without problem.
   The waterfront is lined with sacks of wheat, vegetable oil from
Singapore, dusty pickup trucks, tractors and cars, and even
equipment for a long-planned Pepsi Cola plant in Kabul.
   Huge cranes lift goods onto waiting trucks. Among the supplies
are 3,200 tons of flour, 1,100 tons of sugar and 12,300 tons of
cooking oil and tens of thousands of tons of cement, wood and
metals.
   A faded poster at the port entrance underscores the relationship
between the superpower and its war-weary southern neighbor. Blue
circles indicate food, fuel and medicine brought into Afghanistan
from the Soviet Union, while black rockets and a red white and blue
claw with dollar signs indicate supplies brought in from Pakistan
to the guerrillas.
   Leaders of the guerrillas are based in Pakistan and Iran. U.S.
aid to the insurgents is funneled through Islamabad.

   Vice President Dan Quayle will visit Central
America this month, on a four-day trip to show administration
support for the newly elected president of El Salvador and rally
opposition to Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega, Quayle's
office said Thursday.
   The June 11-14 journey will include stops in Guatemala,
Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica.
   Quayle is to meet with the presidents of those countries, as
well as political opposition and military leaders. He will also see
leaders of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, said his press secretary
David Beckwith. He declined to say where that meeting would take
place.
   The trip will be Quayles's second to El Salvador, following a
visit in early February in which the vice president sternly linked
continued U.S. aid to a commitment by government and military
leaders to crack down on human rights violations.
   Since that visit, the election of Alfredo Cristiani as president
has created new worries on Capitol Hill because of ties between
Cristiani's party, Arena, and past death squad activity.
   Cristiani's inauguration Thursday sparked leftist violence in El
Salvador and a spate of protests across the United States by
activists opposed to continued U.S. aid.
   But Quayle's visit is meant to demonstrate U.S. support for
Cristiani and the intention to give him a chance to make good on
his promise to uphold human rights and seek a negotiated settlement
to the country's bloody rebel war.
   Quayle is expected to underscore the human rights message again,
but without the stern lecture he gave military generals on his last
visit.
   Quayle's discussions regarding Panama may be colored by the
upcoming report of an Organization of American States delegation
that visited Panama.
   The team of diplomats from Trinidad, Guatemala and Costa Rica
recently returned after four days of futile talks aimed at finding
a solution to the political crisis stemming from May 7 elections
that were widely seen as rigged by Noriega.
   They make their formal report to the OAS on June 6, as a beefed
up U.S. military presence in Panama and harsh anti-Noriega rhetoric
have resulted in no visible signs that Noriega is on the way out.
   Quayle will encourage U.S. allies in the region to stick with
the United States in its anti-Noriega effort, Beckwith said.
   He also is expected to discuss the Central American peace
process aimed at ending the rebel war in Nicaragua.
   The Contra troops, encamped inside Honduras near the Nicaraguan
border, are being sustained with U.S. non-military assistance until
Nicaraga hold elections next February.
   The Bush administration has committed to the diplomatic route in
Nicaragua while watching to see whether that country's leftist
government will fulfill its promises of democratic reforms.
   Quayle's earlier visit to El Salvador, on the first foreign trip
of the Bush administration, was to highlight U.S. attention to the
region and to warn El Salvador that the new U.S. president expected
enforcement of human rights standards.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Resigns For Health Reasons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Bill K. Perrin has
resigned for health reasons and will leave Cyprus in summer for
treatment in the United States, the U.S. Embassy said Thursday.
   The embassy did not disclose the nature of his ailment, nor what
day he would leave.
   Perrin, 51, returned to Nicosia a week ago from consultations in
the United States, where doctors advised him that it would be
``unwise to continue his official mission in Cyprus,'' an embassy
statement said.
   It quoted Perrin as saying: ``I regret that for health reasons,
I will not be able to serve my government in Cyprus as long as I
have wished.''
   ``I trust that the people of Cyprus will give the same genuine
support to my successor when that person is named by President
Bush.''
   The White House has not yet named the successor, the embassy
said.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir is proposing new and harsher military measures for dealing
with the nearly 18-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   But lack of money and manpower limit military options, and army
commanders maintain they cannot by force alone crush the
``intefadeh,'' Arabic for uprising. Instead, steps are being
suggested that put the emphasis on economic pressure.
   Maj. Gen. Meshulam Amit, commander of the 4,800-member border
police, told reporters the textbook ratio was one trooper for every
15 protesters, but the nation of 4.2 million cannot muster the
manpower to meet such standards.
   ``If Israel was going to confront every 100 to 150 protesters,
it would need 200,000 troops in the West Bank,'' Amit told
reporters invited last week for the first time to see Israel's only
anti-riot unit train at this base.
   The border police and army soldiers face hundreds, and sometimes
thousands, of hit-and-run protests and stoning attacks every day in
the 420 villages and 25 cities of the West Bank, an area the size
of Rhode Island.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has said an average of 10,000
soldiers were on duty at any one time in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip last year.
   The cost is about $15 million a month, which experts say could
increase tenfold if there was a massive call-up of reserves.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres estimates the total cost of the
uprising at about $1 billion, including a Central Bank estimate of
a $630 million annual drop in exports and tourism resulting from
the intefadeh.
   Armed Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, facing calls
for his resignation from frustrated Israelis, said on Israel TV
this week the public would have to put up with some unrest because
the army was constrained by law from using its full might against
civilians.
   ``I think we have to pay that price unless someone decides that
this army will act against the norms and against the law,'' he
said. ``Those speaking of wiping out the uprising speak of
something outside the framework of the law. Maybe they just forget
to mention it.''
   At least 503 Palestinians and 22 Israelis have been killed since
the revolt began in December 1987.
   Shamir's call for a harsher military stand comes amid pressure
from hawks in his party led by Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, who as
defense minister orchestrated the 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   Right-wingers demand the government end its ambivalence and give
top priority to crushing the Palestinian rebellion. Some advocate
large-scale deportations for PLO activists, demolishing more houses
of stone throwers and arresting prominent Palestinians involved in
dialogue with Israel's peace camp.
   Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Shamir, confirmed the prime
minister had urged new but unspecified military steps on Rabin, a
member of the rival left-of-center Labor Party and the minister
responsible for the occupied lands.
   ``We could have put an end to the uprising in the first week by
killing thousands of Arabs and expelling hundreds more. We would
have been criticized for a week but then it would be calm,''
Ahimeir said. ``We didn't take this course, and it is probably one
reason the unrest has been prolonged.''
   Ahimeir said the premier was determined the rioting should stop
and ``harsher measures'' may be needed. But he stressed the
government would maintain a policy of holding bloodshed to a
minimum.
   The daily Yediot Ahronot quoted Rabin as responding that the
uprising ``cannot be eliminated by military means, only by a
political move.'' Several members of Shamir's Likud bloc and other
right-wing legislators demanded Rabin's resignation.
   Some officials believe economic and administrative pressure is
the most effective. Transport Minister Moshe Katzav of Shamir's
Likud bloc has urged sealing off the Gaza Strip and its 700,000
residents for three months. This would keep up to 50,000 Arabs from
jobs in Israel.
   Arieh Shalev, a retired general and ex-West Bank military
governor, proposed four measures to reduce violence:
   _ Ban Arab laborers from working in Israel for a fixed period of
several months.
   _ Single out one trouble spot to be put under a three-month
curfew during which time residents would be only allowed out of
their houses to buy food.
   _ Halt exports and travel across bridges to Jordan, where
Palestinian farmers and manufacturers market their goods.
   _ Prohibit the transfer of money from abroad.
   The PLO reportedly sent more than $60 million last year to
compensate Palestinians for relatives who were killed or injured
and houses that were demolished. An Israeli official estimated
nearly $1 billion in PLO money had been sent to the occupied lands
in the past decade.
   ``Israel will pay a price economically by losing Arab labor, but
these measures will bring strong pressure on the Palestinians to
give priority to making a living instead of staging protests,''
said Shalev, an analyst at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies.

   Hundreds of university students crashed a
pro-government rally outside Beijing on Thursday and blocked
several thousand workers and peasants from entering a stadium to
take part.
   ``Chinese people, don't let the government trick you!'' the
students yelled. ``Oppose government scare tactics!''
   Inside the Asian Games Bicycle Stadium in Changping County, 15
miles north of Beijing, about 600 protesters wearing the new straw
hats they received for participating listened to speeches
supporting Premier Li Peng, who ordered martial law in the capital
May 20.
   Li and other hard-line Communist Party members are trying to
discredit the student's movement for democracy, and gain the edge
in a power struggle with moderates.
   Outside the stadium, demonstrators were listless and many said
they had been forced to attend. Some ate popsicles. Others laid
their neatly painted signs on the pavement and sat in the shade.
   ``We had to show up or else we'd lose a day's pay,'' said Li
Jianguo, a truck driver who came with two colleagues. They sat in
the cab of his truck.
   ``Look, I've come here, that's enough. No one is going to make
me yell some kind of chant,'' said one of his friends.
   Others said they had been threatened with losing their jobs.
   ``Our country has many economic problems. If I lose this job I
won't be able to find another,'' said a college graduate working in
a government office.
   Down the street, two farmers sat on the sidewalk and held little
yellow flags that said: ``Down with turmoil, support the Communist
Party.''
   ``I don't know why I'm here,'' said one, as he rolled a
cigarette in newspaper. ``My village head said, `Go,' and I went.''
   Government authorities who had invited Western reporters to the
protest refused to let them enter the stadium. They did not explain
why.
   The demonstration, the fifth in two days held to support Li, was
an attempt to counter the scores of protests in which students have
demanded he resign.
   Since martial law was declared, millions of Chinese have taken
to the streets calling for Li to step down.
   A pro-government demonstration staged Wednesday on the outskirts
of Beijing topped the national news.
   ``Listen to the voice of the peasants,'' read one headline in
Thursday's edition of the Beijing Daily.
   ``Peasants support the party,'' said another in the People's
Daily.
   ``Most of the people here know the truth,'' said Meng Aimin, a
student from the Institute of Petroleum Engineering, who said he
attended Thursday's rally to present the students' side of the
story. ``They're just afraid of their leaders, who forced them to
come.''
   As he spoke, several hundred demonstrators inside the stadium
massed at the gate and talked with students standing outside.
   ``Don't listen to your leaders. The government is corrupt,''
said one student to a nodding worker.
   A local official came out and split the two groups.
   ``Now you listen to me,'' he shouted at the pro-government
protesters. ``I am your leader. Not anybody else. Now repeat after
me.''
   Thrusting a fist in the air, he shouted: ``Support Li Peng!
Support the Communist Party!''
   But the silent demonstrators backed away with embarrassed smiles.
   ``Dog!'' yelled one student. ``What kind of thing are you?''
yelled another.
   The official would not be moved. He repeated himself. Again
silence.
   The students roared.
   ``Victory is ours,'' they chanted. ``Victory to the people.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Accuses Authorities of Trying to Shake Confidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity accused the communisty
authorities Thursday of escalating a propaganda campaign to shake
people's confidence in opposition candidates.
   A communist newspaper said the opposition's goals threaten
Poland's security.
   Authorities appeared increasingly concerned that voters in
Sunday's parliamentary election would vote against even those
communist candidates who were running without opposition.
   On the evening television news, commentators argued against
crossing out the names of 35 Communist Party or party-allied
candidates running unopposed.
   At stake are all 460 seats in the Sejm, or parliament, and the
100 seats in the newly created Senate _ the first freely elected
legislative chamber in the East bloc. The opposition has been
allotted 161 of the Sejm seats.
   In a front-page editorial Thursday in the daily Trybuna Luda,
communist editor Jerzy Majka said that ``what the opposition is
pushing for and the ways in which it is doing this threatens the
security of Poland and Poles.''
   ``It could tip the fragile balance of forces in Europe and the
world and pose a threat of dangerous consequences,'' Majka said.
``It cuts down on Poland's sovereignty in favor of the West.''
   The government coalition this week has issued increasingly
strong statements accusing the Solidarity-led opposition of
inappropriate links to Western organizations.
   Solidarity said the criticisms repeat charges used during the
government's long duel with the union, which was legalized again in
April after its repression during the martial law crackdown of 1981.
   ``In the last week before the election we notice a stepping up
of the campaign against Solidarity that aims to rattle society's
confidence in Solidarity,'' said Piotr Konopka, reading a statement
of the Solidarity Citizen's Committee.
   ``They say we are using foreign funds. This argument has been
used in the past and should stop,'' said the statement.
   Solidarity says aid received from abroad is consistent with
Polish law. The union has not specified how much it receives but
said it comes mainly from Poles and supporters in unions and the
arts.
   The elections stem from the political, economic and union
reforms negotiated during two months of talks that ended in April.
   The government invited the opposition to talk in part to reduce
social tension and create an atmosphere of reform to encourage
foreign investment and help with Poland's $39 million foreign debt.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who is not a candidate, appeared
at an election rally in Gydnia, near his Gdansk home, and spoke to
about 5,000 chanting supporters.
   ``In the last 45 years, I don't remember such elections. We have
a bigger chance now to make this the country of our dreams,''
Walesa said.
   Asked about the opposition's prospects, he said: ``If we get 15
percent or 50 percent, I will say thank you.''
   Walesa met Thursday with a Polish-American businesswoman as part
of an effort to save Soldarity's birthplace, the Lenin Shipyard,
from government-ordered liquidation. He also met with the director
of the shipyard.
   The union said Barbara Piasecka-Johnson, a Polish-born heir to
the Johnson and Johnson pharmaceutical fortune, signed a
preliminary agreement to form a joint stock company intended to
save the yard. There was no independent confirmation.
   The government announced plans in December to liquidate the
shipyard, where Solidarity was founded in 1980, saying it is
unprofitable. Authorities since then have been negotiating with
various private companies to sell off parts of the yard or to
operate enterprises there.
   The Rev. Henryk Jankowski, a pro-Solidarity pastor, said Walesa,
Mrs. Piasecka-Johnson and the shipyard director, Czeslaw Tolwinski,
signed a preliminary agreement to form a join stock company to save
the yard. The enterprise is to start operating by Jan. 1, he said.
   Jankowski gave no further details on Mrs. Piasecka-Johnson's
plans for the company.

   Bob Dylan will return to his home state
this summer for RiverFest, a 10-day festival of music along the
banks of the Mississippi River.
   Born in Duluth and raised in Hibbing, Dylan got his start
singing in coffeehouses near the University of Minnesota in 1959.
But he has performed locally only three times since _ at the
Minneapolis Auditorium in 1965, the St. Paul Civic Center in 1978
and the Metrodome in 1986.
   Other scheduled performers in the festival to be held July 28 to
Aug. 6 include blues-rockers Stevie Ray Vaughan and George
Thorogood, rapper Tone Loc, and rock bands Cheap Trick and Joan
Jett and the Blackhearts.
   But festival promoter Randy Levy said Dylan undoubtedly will be
the star attraction: ``Let this festival be known as the one that
brought Bob Dylan home.''

   John Bush, son of President George Bush
held unofficial talks Thursday with Thailand's Foreign Minister
Siddhi Savetsila on trade issues.
   Traveling with several businessmen from Florida, where he is a
prominent Republican Party figure, Bush is exploring business and
investment opportunities in Thailand.
   The team had a private luncheon with Siddhi and Deputy Prime
Minister Pong Sarasin. Siddhi told reporters they discussed trade
and economic frictions between the United States and Thailand.
   The United States may implement trade penalties against Thailand
for its alleged failure to respect American intellectual property
rights.

   Country singer Lorrie Morgan was
appointed to administer the estate of her late husband, singer
Keith Whitley, and a judge ordered an inventory of Whitley's
outstanding recording royalties.
   Whitley, who died May 9 of an alcohol overdose, left no will,
according to a Probate Court petition filed by Morgan, under her
legal name of Loretta Lynn Whitley.
   The petition said the late singer owned real estate worth more
than $100,000, which will automatically go to his wife as the
surviving joint owner.
   Morgan, a member of the Grand Ole Opry, estimated the value of
her husband's personal property at more than $80,000 and the gross
value of Whitley's estate at $50,000. She said she and the couple's
two children are Whitley's only heirs.

   Andrei Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner
have accepted an invitation to visit Norway later this month, the
Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,
said Thursday.
   Sakharov was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 while still
branded a dissident. His wife was permitted to accept the prize on
his behalf in Oslo.
   Both the Council and the Norwegian Nobel Committee have
frequently invited the couple to visit Norway after Sakharov was
allowed to leave the closed city of Gorky, where he spent several
years in internal exile.
   The couple plan to leave Moscow on June 15 and visit the
Netherlands and Britain before arriving in Oslo on June 26 or 27.

   Employees at Riverside Hospital chose
Kenny G to perform at a special concert and the saxophonist
rewarded them with a special musical preview while they worked.
   Offered the choice of a dinner or a show, hospital employees
opted for a show and selected Kenny G over Ray Charles, Johnny
Cash, the Statler Brothers, Frankie Avalon, dancer Gregory Hines
and others. The hospital hired him to perform Wednesday night at
the Ohio Theater in a concert for employees and their families.
   Kenny G also performed for several patients at the hospital and
stopped by the nursery to serenade 1- and 2-day-olds.
   ``After he played he said, `That's all right, you guys you don't
have to stand,' '' said Erie Chapman, the hospital's president and
chief executive officer.
   ``I think it was a thrill for the atients and the people taking
care of them,'' Chapman said. ``You almost feel like it (music) has
a healing effect itself.''
   Chapman said he did not know how much the hospital paid for
Kenny G's one-hour performance, but it would cost about the same as
dinner for 3,000 people _ about $30,000.
   The hospital's employee recognition program was scheduled to be
held before the concert. In the program, employees receive awards
for years of service and other accomplishments.

   Jean Harris, killer of ``Scarsdale Diet Doctor''
Herman Tarnower, says she is remorseful about his death.
   ``Remorse has become an appendage to me,'' Ms. Harris told
Independent Network News in an interview this week at the Bedford
Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County.
   ``It's like another skin and I live in it and I always will,''
said Ms. Harris, 66.
   She said she feels ``terrible, terribly sorry. You don't throw
it off.''
   Ms. Harris said Tarnower could have prevented his death by
talking to her calmly when she confronted him about a love affair.
Instead, she said, he called her ``crazy'' and hit her in the face.
She then shot him to death.
   Ms. Harris was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison in March
1981. She has appealed twice to Gov. Mario Cuomo for clemency,
without success.

   Singer Carly Simon and slugger Darryl Strawberry
greeted squealing fans Thursday as they were honored in a Central
Park ceremony for their commitment to helping children.
   The creator of such hits as ``You're So Vain'' said standing
next to the Mets star had a special significance for her.
   ``As an 8-year-old or 10-year-old, while my friends were
dreaming of being movie stars, rock stars or whatever, my goal was
to hit one over the center field fence,'' she said, adding that
Jackie Robinson was her childhood idol.
   ``Any time you have a dream, don't imagine it's an impossible
dream,'' Ms. Simon told the group of about 100 children gathered at
a park playground.
   Ms. Simon and Strawberry were among the adults and children
getting community service awards from the Association to Benefit
Children, a group that helps poor, handicapped and AIDS-stricken
youngsters.
   Strawberry, who had traveled overnight after an extra-inning
game on the West Coast, shook some hands and posed for pictures,
but didn't give a speech.
   Ms. Simon donated the proceeds from the first show at her new
art gallery in Manhattan to the children's group, according to Jim
Hart, an ABC volunteer. She also has acted as a spokesperson for
the group from time to time.
   Strawberry was honored ``mostly because he's very important to

<HEAD>Studies Say Nutrition Programs Reach Only Half Women and Children
in Need</HEAD>

   A federal nutrition program for low income
pregnant women and children is reaching only about half those who
need it in the United States, according to two reports released
Thursday.
   About 7.5 million women, infants and children are eligible, but
48 percent are not participating in the program, said Robert Fersh,
executive director of the Food Research and Action Center, which
conducted the two studies.
   ``Our central finding is that young children, those between the
ages of one and five, are the least likely to receive the benefits
of WIC (Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and
Children),'' he said.
   ``In general, low-income children tend to be shorter and
lighter, and are more likely to suffer from impaired iron status
and anemia,'' he said. ``Poorer iron status is associated with
poorer performance on standardized tests.''
   He said even mild undernutrition can lead to bad behavior,
increased illness and decreased ability to learn.
   Fersh said more federal funding is needed if there is to be more
WIC participation.
   Fersh appeared at a press conference with Sens. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry
Committee, and Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., to release the studies and
a letter signed by 73 senators supporting a $150 million increase
in WIC funding.
   The letter to Sen. Quentin Burdik, D-N.D., chairman of the
Appropriations subcommittee on agriculture, rural development and
related agencies, seeks a total $2.158 billion for the program.
   That is the same amount recommended in the budget resolution for
fiscal 1990 passed by Congress in a compromise with the White
House. But that does not mean WIC will receive the amount. Several
other legislative procedures must follow before funds are actually
granted.
   Last year, Burdick's subcommittee increased WIC funding by $55
million, though the Senate Budget Committee had recommended a $150
million increase. His subcommittee is expected to make its
recommendation for the new fiscal year by late summer, said Jean
Brodshaug, Burdick's press secretary.
   WIC falls under the Agriculture Department's budget which the
Bush administration wants cut by $1 billion. The subcommittee will
have to decide if it can afford to increase WIC at the expense of
other programs, said Brodshaug.

<HEAD>Seoul Considers North Korea's Family Reunion Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea will carefully consider
whether to accept a North Korean proposal to resume exchanging home
visits by separated family members in the divided land, a
government official said Thursday.
   ``We will carefully study the North Korean proposal and make our
position known shortly,'' said the official at the National
Unification Board, which handles inter-Korea relations.
   Another official at the ministry said, however, that Seoul would
have to accept with ``some reservations'' the North Korean proposal
which he believes has political motives to stir up instability in
South Korea.
   ``We know that North Korea has ulterior intentions in making the
proposal, but we will have to accept it from a humanitarian point
of view,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In a letter sent to Seoul through the border village of
Panmunjom on Wednesday, North Korea proposed the two nations
exchange arts troupes and home visits by separated family members
on Aug. 15, the Korean National Liberation Day.
   North Korea also suggested that working officials of both
nations meet at the border village June 16 to work out details of
the proposal.
   If the proposal is implemented, it will be the second exchange
of separated family members between the two Koreas. In 1985, the
two Koreas exchanged 50 people each for family reunions for the
first time since their land was divided in 1945.
   South Korea sought to further expand the humanitarian program,
but North Korea suddently halted negotiations the following year to
protest annual U.S.-South Korea joint ``Team Spirit'' military
exercises.
   There are about 10 million dispersed family members in the two
nations. They have been separated since the Korean War ended in
1953.

<HEAD>Surgeons Splitting Livers, Saving Coma Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeons who are splitting livers for transplants
with growing frequency and success said Thursday the procedure is a
solution to the serious organ shortage.
   ``We're potentially doubling the number of patients who could be
treated with an available donor,'' said Dr. Jean Emond, assistant
professor of surgery at the University of Chicago.
   Doctors in Pennsylvania are reporting another milestone, what's
believed to be the first transplant on a patient who previously had
a donated liver inserted next to her own failing organ when she was
in a coma. The teen-ager's natural liver and auxiliary liver were
removed and replaced with a single organ this week.
   The patient, a 16-year-old girl, is reported doing fine.
   The auxiliary liver ``really did function as a bridge,'' said
Dr. Michael Moritz, assistant professor of surgery at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia. During a coma, an auxiliary
transplant is less risky because it involves less surgery.
   Both groups' achievements are exciting, said Dr. J. Wesley
Alexander, president of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.
   ``It shows what's possible,'' he said.
   Emond reported at the society's annual meeting that 10 livers
have been split by University of Chicago doctors since last summer.
Fourteen of the 20 recipients were children.
   In each case, the larger right lobe of the liver went to the
larger of the two patients, Emond said. The results were much the
same between the adults and children.
   Fifteen of the 20 patients are alive, three of them with second
transpants, Emond said. One patient received a pared-down liver the
second time around, while the other two got full-size organs.
   The pared-down liver is among 18 transplanted by Emond and his
colleagues over the past few years into children unable to sustain
the potentially long wait for a child-sized organ. The liver is
unique among human organs in its regenerative ability.
   Patient survival is 79 percent for those receiving pared-down
organs, compared with 75 percent for split livers and 82 percent
for full-sized organs, at the University of Chicago, the major site
for such transplants, Emond said.
   Livers are trimmed when there is only one suitable candidate and
split when there are two, Emond said.
   ``We can potentially split any liver,'' he said. ``Since it's a
new technique, we don't know all the possible ramifications. We're
hesitant to use it except in relatively urgent cases.
   ``But we're incredibly confident and we're likely to do more.''
   Such measures would be unnecessary if more donor organs were
available, Emond said. Half of all infants and toddlers awaiting a
new liver are said to die.
   Of the 767 people waiting for liver transplants in the United
States as of Monday, 229 were 18 or under, according to the United
Network for Organ Sharing.
   ``The excitingly good results of liver transplantation are
resulting in a rapid increase in the number of potential patients
who want to be treated,'' Emond said.
   More and more transplants are being performed on patients with
fulminant hepatic failure, a condition in which the liver rapidly
loses function as a result of viral infections such as hepatitis,
medication overdoses or mushroom poisoning. Victims sometimes lapse
into comas, as did the 16-year-old in Philadelphia.
   Moritz performed the transplant on the girl at Thomas Jefferson
University Hospital on Wednesday, a month after he inserted a donor
liver below her own. She had suffered from a disease in which
copper accumulates in the organs.
   Moritz said he decided on a standard transplant because her
auxiliary liver was deteriorating.
   It was the second time Moritz inserted an auxiliary liver, known
as a heterotopic transplant, into a patient with fulminant hepatic
failure. The first case, on Dec. 14, 1988, involved a 19-year-old
woman who still has both her own liver and the auxiliary organ.
   Sandy Evans of Folcroft, Pa., had been in a coma for 12 hours
before the heterotopic transplant was performed. Her liver failure
was due to hepatitis.
   ``I'm doing just fine, no complaints whatsoever,'' she said in a
phone interview Thursday from her job as a medical secretary at the
hospital.
   Ms. Evans and the 16-year-old are believed to be the only people
in the world to successfully undergo a heterotopic liver transplant
for fulminant hepatic failure, Moritz said.
   Moritz said he has performed standard liver transplants on eight
other patients with fulminant hepatic failure, six of whom were in
a coma and two who were close. Four of the eight are alive.

   After five rounds and 832 words, the field of
contestants in the 62nd National Spelling Bee was narrowed today to
18 girls and 16 boys, of whom 10 have taken part in the national
competition before.
   The winner was scheduled to be named after the final round later
in the day.
   Among those remaining in contention was Lisa M. Edwin of Dwight,
Ill., one of the six 10-year-olds who were among the 222 who began
the competition on Wednesday. The youngest entry in the bee, Lisa
Ishimaru of Sacramento, Calif., was eliminated earlier in the day.
   The competition is open to students who have not reached their
16th birthday or passed beyond the 8th grade.
   Of the surviving contestants after the fifth round, three were
competing at the national level for the third time: Scott Isaacs,
14, of Englewood, Colo.; Kanika Bahl, 13, of Beavercreek, Ohio, and
Robert Pryor, 12, of Washington. Seven others were making their
second appearance.
   Lisa, the daughter of a state tax auditor in Sacramento, left
out the ``e'' in ``yeomanry'' and joined 70 older competitors on
the sidelines as a result of the fourth round. Earlier, she had
correctly spelled ``mountebank,`` ``blolly'' and ``reflorescence.''
   Yeomanry means a body of small landowners or a troop of soldiers.
   Lisa walked from the stage with a solemn face, but showed no
sign of dismay such as a visible slump or headshake, as some of the
other losers did.
   The opening day's competition winnowed a field of 222, the
largest in the history of the event, to 151, including Lisa, a 4th
grader who studies the violin.
   Although she is the only 9-year-old in this year's bee,
competing with youngsters up through age 15, she is not the
youngest in the history of the event. Iris Liu of Muncie, Ind., was
a few weeks short of her 9th birthday when she competed in last
year's field of 200. But she lost out on the first day, stumbling
over the word ``waywiser.''
   By the end of three rounds, 601 words had been spelled, compared
with 485 last year.
   The one tense moment of the day came when Susan Bonner, 11, a
6th grader from Fort Necessity, La., spelled ``scordatura'' so
softly that it took the judges five minutes to figure out she had
spelled it wrong.
   Susan sat nervously in a front seat as the judges played and
replayed a tape recording. Then they rang the bell, indicating a
mistake. She had used a ``t'' instead of a ``d'' in the word, which
means tuning an instrument to produce a special effect.
   In one of the few quips injected into the serious business of
spelling, Angela Martin, 14, of St. Petersburg, Fla., borrowed a
line from the television show ``Wheel of Fortune'' and exclaimed,
``Oh, God, can I buy a vowel?'' when she was given the word
``boulevardier'' to spell. Even without any such help, she spelled
it right.
   Those eliminated in the first day's spelling included three
13-year-olds who were competing in the bee for the second time.
Travis P. Tharp of Pensacola, Fla., misspelled ``pluricellular,''
Ana M. Gordan of Manchester, N.H., stumbled over ``inumbrate'' and
Cheryl D. Frye of Woodstock, Va., went down on ``wokas,'' a plant
that grows wild in the West.
   Four of the six 10-year-olds in the competition were eliminated.
Malinda Shepherd of Burnsville, N.C., was tripped up by
``seriatim,'' Cheryl Klein of Peculiar, Mo., by ``rhizotomy,''
Laura Nawojchik of Leesburg, Va., by ``bijouterie'' and Emily J.
Banwell of Alamo, Calif., by ``floccose.''
   Also in the competition at the start were 24 who are 11, 45 who
are 12, 89 who are 13, 55 who are 14 and two who are 15.
   Nearly 9 million students participated at the local level in
contests sponsored by Scripps Howard newspapers in 13 cities and by
205 other daily, weekly and Sunday newspapers.
   The winner will receive a cash award of $1,500. Other prizes are
$1,000 for second, $750 for third, $500 for fourth, $400 for fifth,
$300 for sixth, $200 for seventh through 10th, $100 for 11th
through 20th, and 202 prizes of $50 each.

   Thousands of Presbyterians are coming to
historic Philadelphia to elect a new moderator to lead the fight to
reverse the church's membership decline.
   The 622 official delegates to the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) will attend sessions beginning Tuesday
and running through June 14. A pre-assembly symposium begins Friday.
   The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) traces its origins to the First
Presbytery founded in Philadelphia 283 years ago. Then a number of
colonial churches, some formed as early as 1683, banded together to
form the denomination in the first General Assembly held here in
1789.
   Presbyterian membership grew to a high of more than 4 million in
the mid-1960s, then began to fall to today's 2,938,830 members in
11,573 churches. Dwindling membership is a problem shared generally
with all the long-standing denominations.
   The Rev. C. Kenneth Hall, of Butler, Pa., current church
moderator and presiding officer for the 201st General Assembly,
believes the church needs to reclaim the powerful voice it once
exerted on social, economic and political issues if it wants to
buck the trend.
   ``Our church is determined to turn this thing around, which is
why at our last Assembly we established evangelism as one of our
priorities, and over the next five years we are going to commit $15
million to bring in new members,'' he said.
   Two men and two women face election Wednesday to succeed Hall as
moderator.
   They are the Rev. James Johnson Jr., 61, pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church, Columbus, Ga.; the Rev. Joan Salmon Campbell,
51, associate executive for mission programs in the Philadelphia
Presbytery; the Rev. William Skinner, 56, pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church, Sioux City, Iowa, and Ms. Agnes Wilson, elder
in the Second Presbyterian Church, Sumter, S.C.
   Also on the agenda is a proposal to increase annual per capita
dues 16 cents to $3.55. The church budget is currently $11.6
million.
   Opening Friday is the three-day ``Continue the Journey, A
Symposium on the Future.''
   Keynoter Roger Heyns, former chancellor of the University of
California at Berkeley, will discuss developments in science,
economics, the arts, education, politics and technology and how
they will shape the church's future.
   Presenters include West Germany's President Richard von
Weizacker on global politics; Maxine Singer, president of the
Carnegie Institution of Washington, on biology and health; the Rev.
Patricia McClurg, president of the National Council of Churches of
Christ in the United States, on religion; Shigekuni Kawamura,
president of Japan Ink Chemical Industry, on business and the
world's economy; Margaret McKenna, president of Lesly College, on
education and entertainer Steve Allen, on communications.
   Because of the bicentennial flavor of this year's meeting, a
number of social events are being planned for the 10,000 delegates,
alternates, their families and church members expected.
   Among the activities will be a week-long ``Gift to the City''
work on a low-cost housing project. Members of about 30
Presbyterian churches will contribute over 1,200 hours of labor and
some $100,000 to five groups for low-cost housing to poor
Philadelphians.
   ``Although a one-week effort cannot solve Philadelphia's housing
crisis it can make a major impact,'' said Chairman George
Hollingshead Jr., associate pastor of suburban Bryn Mawr
Presbyterian Church. ``This project is also intended to be a model
for future Presbyterian national meetings in other cities.''

<HEAD>Government Urged to Expand Ivory Import Curb to Save Elephants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Interior Department said Thursday it is
considering additional trade restrictions on African ivory but a
conservation group said the need is for an immediate ban.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, saying he was ``outraged over
the illegal poaching of African elephants'' for their ivory tusks,
said the Bush administration was ``on the verge'' of expanding
import controls.
   But he said that ``no solution to the elephant problem can be
effective without the full participation of the African nations
that have elephants'' and other nations where demand for ivory is
considerable.
   Lujan said the United States already prohibits ivory imports
from more than 70 nations, but that does not seem to be enough to
curtail large amounts of ivory from coming into this country
through commercial trade channels or illegally.
   ``We have reason to believe that some of this ivory is from
illegal trading and that the commercial trading is out of
control,'' said Lujan in a statement.
   An Interior spokesman, Steve Goldstein, said one action being
``looked at very seriously'' is expanding the ivory import ban to
nations such as Japan where ivory does not originate, but where
businesses are heavily involved in the importing and exporting of
ivory and ivory products.
   According to the department, the African elephant has declined
in numbers from about 1.5 million a decade ago to fewer than
700,000 because of an onslaught by poachers interested only in the
ivory tusks. Conservation groups suggest the number could be closer
to 400,000.
   An international convention scheduled for October is likely to
reach agreement on procedures aimed at permanently banning
international commercial trading of African elephant ivory.
   But officials of several conservation groups said Thursday at a
news conference that the expectation of such an action by 102
nations in October could launch ``an elephant holocaust across
Africa'' by poachers seeking to beat the ban.
   ``It is absolutely vital that the United States and the European
community immediately ban ivory imports until international
agreement can be reached in October,'' said Russell Train, chairman
of the World Wildlife Fund. He urged ivory importers in Hong Kong
and Japan, where much of the ivory is made into jewelry and other
items, to take similar action.
   David Western, director of Wildlife Conservation International,
said that industrial nations also should provide emergency funds to
help African governments ``cope with the expected surge in poaching
and smuggling'' of elephant ivory prior to the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species.
   The conference is expected to place the African elephant into a
more protective category which would prohibit elephants from being
killed for their ivory.
   According to the conservation groups, the volume of ivory
exported from Africa has steadily increased from 300 tons a year in
the 1950s to more than 800 tons a year in recent years. The volume
has dropped somewhat during the last two years, but
conservationists attribute that largely to the rapidly dwindling
supply of elephants.
   In a related matter, Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., urged Lujan in
a letter Thursday to immediately ban ivory imports and send ``a
very strong signal about our commitment to the protection of the
African elephant.''

<HEAD>Eight Jets Damaged When Hangar Collapses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ceiling of a hangar collapsed at an
air base southeast of New Delhi, damaging eight Indian air force
Mirage-2000 combat jets, it was reported Thursday.
   Two of the French-built planes were damaged beyond repair and
six others suffered extensive damage in the air force's biggest
peacetime accident, according to Defense Ministry sources quoted by
the Indian Express.
   Damage to the Mirages, purchased in 1985, was estimated at $175
million.
   Defense Ministry spokesman T.G. Nallamuthu confirmed the
accident but insisted the damage to the jets was minor.
   The newspaper said at least four people working inside the
hangar were injured in the accident last week at Gwalior, 170 miles
southeast of New Delhi. It did not give the exact day.
   The 115,000-man Indian air force has 701 combat aircraft,
including 40 Mirage-2000s.

<HEAD>Whites Sentenced to 10 Years For Stoning Death of Black</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two whites each were sentenced
to 10 years in prison Thursday for killing an 8-year-old black who
was struck in the head by a stone thrown from the back of a pickup
truck.
   According to testimony, the two were part of a group of high
school students who skipped classes Oct. 12, 1987, and went
drinking at a park. On the drive back, they decided to throw stones
at pedestrians.
   Shane Mitchell, 18, was convicted of murder for throwing the
stone that killed Ronnie Pitso. The youth died of brain injuries.
   Timothy Beddingfield, 20, also was convicted of murder on the
grounds that the knew the stone was about to be thrown and did
nothing to stop Mitchell.

<HEAD>Farewells Paid to Long-time Champion of the Elderly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Members of Congress and thousands of other
Americans somberly bade farewell to Rep. Claude Pepper on Thursday
as the octogenarian champion of the elderly lay in state in the
Capitol Rotunda.
   Pepper's flag-draped casket was quietly carried into the rotunda
by members of the four armed services and placed on a wooden
catafalque draped in black velvet with silk cord and fringe.
   Pepper's family, members of Congress and his staff encircled the
open casket for a brief memorial service.
   The 88-year-old Florida Democrat, who died of stomach cancer
Tuesday at Walter Reed Army Hospital, is only one of 26 Americans
to lie in state in the rotunda and only the second to have his
casket open as had Army Gen. Douglas H. MacArthur.
   Resigning House Speaker Jim Wright lauded Pepper's ``optimism
for the future'' and ``compassion for those less fortunate.''
   ``We who are his friends are richer for having known him,'' said
Wright, who said he became a disciple of Pepper after first hearing
him speak in 1944.
   Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell of Maine added,
``Claude Pepper's death marks the passing of an era in American
history. To the 101st Congress, from the early days of the
Roosevelt Administration, when the energies of the federal
government were turned to the tasks of dealing with a nation
`one-third ill-housed, ill-clothed, and ill-fed', Claude Pepper
never forgot his duty as an elected official to fight for the
common welfare.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle told of President and Mrs. Bush
presenting Pepper the Congressional Medal of Freedom in his
hospital bed, shortly before his death.
   At the end of the ceremony, Dennis Cravedi, a 6-year-old student
at Woods Academy in Bethesda, Md., placed his running medals in
Pepper's casket. Son of the staff director of the Subcommittee on
Health and Long-Term Care, the youth had wanted to present his
medals to Pepper before his death but never had an opportunity.
   For five hours, Americans filed past the casket to view the
body. Many had personal memories of Pepper, while others claimed
only to benefit from his lifelong battles for Social Security and
other pensions, catastrophic health insurance and other laws aimed
at helping the poor and the elderly.
   ``He's done so much for other people, including me,'' said Henry
Thomas of Washington. ``Because of him, I am able to live with my
pensions. It's helpful for me and my wife.''
   Paul Cook of St. Petersburg, Fla. said, ``I remember Claude
Pepper as a proud liberal. The word has been besmirched. I treasure
his memory for that.''
   ``He was so good for the elderly people, the downtrodden and the
helpless. He was a beauty,'' said Vivian Crawford, 72, of Chicago.
   DeKalb, Ill. Mayor Greg Sparrow said he had followed Pepper's
``illustrious career'' since taking office in 1981. ``He was a
strong advocate for seniors.''
   There will be an additional viewing in Tallahassee, Fla. on
Sunday before burial Monday.

   An woman who spent a record 130 days in a New
Mexico cave for an isolation experiment appears to be faring well
after her underground stay, doctors testing her for possible bone
loss said Thursday.
   Stefania Follini, 27, an interior decorator from Ancona, Italy,
who volunteered for the job, appeared happy and healthy Thursday as
she described the experiment as a positive experience and one she
would repeat.
   Doctors checked Ms. Follini to see if she lost any bone mass
during her period of reduced activity, and they are awaiting
results from a battery of other physical tests.
   ``She looks fine to me,'' said Dr. Adrian LeBlanc, manager of
nuclear medicine for Houston's Methodist Hospital, where Ms.
Follini was tested this week. The only noticeable difference is her
17-pound weight loss; she now weighs 90 pounds.
   Ms. Follini was a little confused about the passage of time at
the end of her stay underground, and when told she would be coming
out May 22 she said she thought it was March 14. While sealed off
from outside time clues, her days had gradually lengthened as she
stayed awake longer and longer.
   She first reported having problems readjusting to a 24-hour day,
but said Thursday she had overcome most of those difficulties.
   Ms. Follini said through an interpreter that she is looking at
the world with more attentiveness and curiosity than before her
stay in the cave. She also said noises seemed much louder since she
emerged from the cave.
   ``I can see now my attention is better,'' she said.
   The experiment was conducted by a non-profit Italian research
group, Pioneer Frontier Exploration and Researches, which also has
conducted other isolation projects similar to Ms. Follini's.
   On Thursday, she underwent a test that documented the amount of
mineral in her bones. The same test was done before she went
underground for comparison.
   LeBlanc said the results will be available in several days and
will be turned over to the Italian researchers.
   ``I don't expect a large (bone) loss,'' he said, adding that any
decrease should be restored naturally as Ms. Follini gets back in
her regular routine above ground.
   A loss of calcium or other minerals in her bones could be
attributed to a decrease in exercise. Ms. Follini said she
exercised some in the cave, but not as much as she normally does.
   A decrease also could be caused by a lack of estrogen. For
reasons researchers have not yet determined, Ms. Follini didn't
have a regular menstrual cycle during her underground stay.
   Dr. Andrea Galvagno, one of two Italian researchers in Houston
to monitor Ms. Follini's health, said a loss of calcium also might
be caused by the lack of sunlight.
   LeBlanc said the results could help Methodist researchers
determine the effects of activity on bones. The test performed on
Ms. Follini is the same one used to gauge osteoporosis, the loss of
bone mass in the elderly.
   Ms. Follini was to leave Houston on Saturday. She and two
Italian researchers will attend a medical convention in Paris
before returning to Italy.
   She will undergo further tests in Italy to help determine how
well researchers prepared her psychologically for the underground
stay, said Maurizio Montalbini, a psychologist overseeing the
experiment.
   After visiting with friends and enjoying the summer, Ms. Follini
said she will look for a new job as an interior decorator. She had
to quit her previous job to do the experiment.

   The Soviet leadership, stung by accusations of
complicity or coverup in a bloody military assault on Georgian
demonstrators in April, took the extraordinary step Thursday of
revealing secret cables about it.
   ``This is the original,'' Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov
told the hushed Congress of People's Deputies, holding up a cable
in which the Georgian Communist Party chief told the Kremlin of the
bloodshed at a pro-independence demonstration six hours after it
happened.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the deputies Wednesday the
cables established the need for a commission to investigate the
matter.
   He was responding to charges by Yuri Vlasov of Moscow that
Gorbachev must know who was responsible for the order to clear
Rustavelli Prospekt in Tbilisi, capital of the Georgian republic.
   Other deputies have said a high official must have known in
advance of the assault. They demanded the official be identified.
   The Kremlin response emphasized the new parliament's power to
demand explanations of government actions. The public reading of
three cables to Moscow from former Georgian party leader Dzhumber
Patiashvili was an unprecedented revelation of documents
traditionally kept secret.
   Soldiers dispersed thousands of pro-independence demonstrators
in Tbilisi at 4 a.m. April 9, and 20 civilians were killed.
   Lukyanov, reading from the documents to the silent hall, said
Patiashvili cabled Moscow at 8:50 p.m., seven hours before the
assault, saying the situation was tense but under control.
   ``There is no need for any kind of extra, extreme measures from
the Central Committee of the Communist Party or the government,''
he read.
   The next cable, at 10:25 a.m. April 9, told Moscow authorities
of the casualties, Lukyanov said. That appeared to support
statements by Gorbachev and other officials that they learned of
the attack six hours after it happened.
   ``These are the events as they developed,'' Gorbachev told the
deputies Wednesday. ``We have to follow these events to their roots
and clear it up, take it to the Supreme Soviet and make whatever
decision is necessary in this case.''
   The 2,250-member Congress established its own commission to
investigate.
   Col. Gen. Igor Rodionov, who commanded the soldiers in Tbilisi,
told reporters the cables were authentic. Rodionov, also is a
deputy, had a bitter exchange with Patiashvili during the Tuesday
session about responsibility for the deaths.
   Patiashvili said Rodionov and other military officials told a
meeting of leaders in Tbilisi they had orders from Moscow to stop
demonstrations that had gripped the city for almost a week.
   On Thursday, Rodionov said the cables to Moscow accurately
reflected the situation in Tbilisi at the time, but the situation
deteriorated into a ``pure orgy, with anti-Soviet slogans ...
appeals to overturn the government, appeals to exterminate
communists and those who were opposed to them.''
   A Georgian commission has accused the military of a ``planned .
.. massacre'' using shovels, clubs and chemical substances.
   Rodionov told reporters Thursday the victims in Tbilisi were
crushed to death, not killed by soldiers. He denied chemicals were
used.
   ``The version about gas was needed to create a picture of
violence _ not a picture of resistance but a picture of violence
against a holiday atmosphere, where people were singing, dancing
and praying,'' he said.
   He said he would be satisfied with any national investigating
group but did not trust the Georgian commission, which circulated
its report at the Congress.

<TEXT>
   Rightist Alfredo Cristiani
assumed the presidency Thursday and pledged to rescue the nation
from its nine-year civil war and poverty.
   The 41-year-old businessman, leader of the Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, offered Marxist-led guerrillas
immediate dialogue on ending the war, but he made it clear he would
not negotiate government policy or share power.
   ``In this moment of assuming leadership, we are the enemies of
no one,'' Cristiani said. ``We are not asking for anyone's
surrender.
   ``But we also cannot permit that social harmony be achieved
through violating the law. We have sworn to uphold the constitition
and the law, and that we will do.''
   The guerrilla group Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
said on its clandestine radio: ``Arena means war, poverty and
totalitarianism.''
   El Salvador's civil war has killed an estimated 70,000 people,
most of them civilians.
   Cristiani's inauguration ceremony was held at the capital's
international fairgrounds before about 6,000 people.
   The presidents of Guatemala, Costa Rica and Honduras attended,
and 33 other countries sent delegations. The U.S. delegation was
headed by Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
   Electricity for the ceremony had to be provided by generators
powered by gasoline and diesel because guerrilla sabotage overnight
left 90 percent of the country, which is about the size of
Massachusetts, without power. The rebels have vowed to make the
country ``ungovernable.''
   Cristiani's 45-minute inaugural speech was a tribute to free
enterprise and what he believed conservative economic policy will
do to revive the nation's economy.
   But he also promised ``a judiciary more effectual each day, and
ever greater respect for human rights.''
   The U.S. government has supported the Christian Democrats, the
party of outgoing president Jose Napoleon Duarte, and has expressed
concern about an eventual rise in human rights abuses under Arena.
   Arena was founded in 1981 by former army major and alleged
death-squad kingpin Roberto d'Aubuisson, who is still hailed by
stalwarts as the party's ``maximum leader.''
   Rightist death squads are blamed for more than 20,000 deaths in
the early 1980s. D'Aubuisson and Arena deny any connection with the
squads and say Arena, because of its nationalism, has been
slandered by Christian Democrats, the foreign press and human
rights organizations.
   Cristiani dedicated several minutes of his speech to the rights
issue in an apparent attempt to allay fears.
   D'Aubuisson was hailed with thunderous applause and chants of
his surname twice during the ceremony. He responded a beaming smile
and a raised clenched fist.
   Cristiani decried the corruption perceived as rampant in the
administration of Duarte and promised his government would be based
on ``liberty, honesty, legality and security.''
   Duarte, who is dying of cancer, sat impassively on the dais next
to Cristiani before he took the oath and received the presidential
sash.
   Francisco Merino, 37, was sworn in as vice president.
   Corruption, as well as Duarte's failure to end the war and
improve the economy, contributed to Arena's landslide victory in
the March 19 presidential election.
   The Christian Democrats nationalized banks and the crop export
business. Cristiani promised to return both industries to the
private sector.
   But he said Arena has no intention of rolling back an agrarian
reform program that has during the past decade redistributed a
third of the nation's arable land.
   ``Marxist war has no future in El Salvador,'' Cristiani said.
``We will work for understanding with all sectors of society. The
FMLN is one of those sectors and we will pursue immediate contact
with them.''
   Cristiani also said he would create a ``national emergency
program'' to create productive jobs. He did not give specifics.
   Half of the working class does not have full-time jobs.
   Cristiani said particular attention would be paid to the
``poorest of the poor'' and peasant farmers, who make up just more
than half of the population of 5.5 million.

<HEAD>Republican Image Makers Try to Exploit Democrats' Problems</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with Brown comment, inserting 3 grafs after 11th graf,
But Rep.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Republican image makers are moving quickly to
exploit the ethics problems of House Democratic leaders, urging GOP
lawmakers to use them as an argument the Democrats have held
control too long.
   ``Power tends to corrupt, absolute power corrupts absolutely,''
says a briefing paper circulated quietly among Republican
congressmen Wednesday as Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, prepared to
resign.
   The quote from Lord Acton, the 19th century historian, was
accompanied by repeated hints that the answer to the ethics mess
could be a switch from Democratic dominance in the House to
Republican control.
   ``The resignation of two of the top three Democrats in the House
is the bitter fruit of 35 years of Democratic control of that
body,'' said the paper designed to arm GOP lawmakers in the war of
words raging over House ethics.
   It suggested that they say the Wright resignation, only days
after Majority Whip Tony Coelho said he would leave the House
rather than prolong the ethics issue in an expected investigation
of his financial dealings, represented ``a genuinely sad moment in
our nation's history.''
   But it also suggested the Republican House members, who will be
up for re-election next year, give their version of who was at
fault.
   ``Democrats would have the news media and the American people
think that Wright and Coelho's fall has to do with `ethical
McCarthyism' and character assassination,'' said the paper. ``This
is absolutely false. Jim Wright and Tony Coelho's falls were
character suicides.''
   The paper was issued by the National Republican Congressional
Committee, which raises money, prepares statements and videos, does
polling and research and other projects aimed at helping House
Republicans polish their political image. House Democrats and both
parties in the Senate maintain similar committees.
   Committee spokesman John Buckley said he wrote the paper on
Tuesday and it was intended primarily for the eyes of GOP
congressmen. ``Obviously, it wasn't intended to be provided to a
reporter,'' he said.
   House Democratic leader Thomas Foley of Washington, who will
take Wright's place as speaker, called for conciliation Thursday.
   But Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., said of the atmosphere in the
House, ``Democrats are trying to act with restraint ... but there
comes a time when people are going to push back, and push back
awfully hard.''
   In New York, Ronald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, used a commencement address at Hunter College
to chastise the GOP, though he made no mention of the congressional
committee's paper.
   ``Republican operatives are happy to leave the world of idealism
and progress behid for the cynical world of sound bites and media
manipulation. Not content with the negative ads they used to
cheapen the 1988 presidential campaign, they want to debase all
politics now. Ideas and actions just get in their way,'' Brown said.
   ``Democrats have led the charge for ethics legislation and
campaign finance reform,'' he said. ``Time after time, we proposed
reform legislation. Time after time Republicans fought it.''
   The GOP paper was similar in some ways to dozens of others
turned out by the committee but in this case it documented the
partisan tone that has saturated the debate over House ethics.
   It summarized allegations against Coelho, but did not tackle the
more tangled specifics that led to Wright's resignation.
   It merely advised Republican congressmen to say that the next
speaker ``must address the very real need for reform in the
House.'' Then it returned to its main point: ``The Democrats in the
House have grown arrogant with their unchallenged power.''
   ``Why did two prominent, intelligent members of the Democratic
leadership get into this bind?'' it asked. ``Because there may hae
been a feeling of invulnerability. When you can absue the rights of
the minority ... for as long as they have, there could well be a
feeling that you can do what you want, ethics be damned.''

<HEAD>House Plans Action on Bill to Restrict FSX-Japan Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Rules Committee cleared the way
Thursday for floor action on a bill to restrict the $6 billion FSX
fighter deal with Japan.
   Under a rule adopted by the panel on a voice vote, the House is
scheduled Tuesday to take up a Senate-passed resolution sponsored
by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., that sets conditions for
coproduction of the FSX, an advanced version of the U.S. F-16.
   Byrd's measure would prohibit transfer of critical American jet
engine technology to Japan and also would bar Japan from selling or
transferring the FSX or its technology to a third country.
   The Bush administration has voiced strong opposition to the
resolution, saying it would infringe on the president's
constitutional powers to conduct negotiations with foreign nations.
   The House also will consider a substitute measure approved by
the House Foreign Affairs Committee and sponsored by Rep. Stephen
J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the panel's Asian and Pacific
affairs subcommittee.
   Solarz's measure would make two major changes in the Byrd
resolution:
   _On critical engine technology, changing the flat prohibition to
an expression of congressional sentiment that such technology
should not be transferred and giving the House and Senate a chance
to veto the arrangement if a transfer were approved.
   _On sale of the FSX or its technology to a third country,
removing the ban but setting up a mechanism for Congress to
disapprove such a sale if the president were to approve it.
   In addition, the House will consider a non-binding
sense-of-Congress resolution sponsored by Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon,
R-N.Y., expressing disapproval of the FSX agreement.
   Under the deal, General Dynamics would join with Japan's
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to codevelop and coproduce the FSX for
deployment by Japan in the late 1990s. General Dynamics is
headquartered in St. Louis, but most of the FSX work would be done
at its F-16 plant in Fort Worth, Texas.

<HEAD>Peruvian Guerrillas Kill 10 Suspected Drug Addicts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas killed 10 alleged drug
addicts in a small city in Peru's cocaine-producing jungle,
officials said Thursday.
   The 10, all young men, were killed before dawn Wednesday in
Tarapoto, a town of 35,000 people about 450 miles north of Lima at
the edge of the coca-growing region.
   The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement had distributed leaflets
in Tarapoto two weeks earlier announcing its intention to ``clean
up'' the town.
   The leaflets warned prostitutes, thieves, drug addicts and
homosexuals that they had 15 days to leave town or be killed. The
period elapsed on Tuesday.
   Eight of the victims were found together near the city cemetery,
each shot in the head, a city official said in a telephone
interview.
   The other two were found in the same area by a police patrol
later Wednesday, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity for security reasons.
   The men were said to have attended a party together Tuesday
night.
   The Tupac Amaru band is a pro-Cuban group that surfaced in 1984
and operates separately from, and in competition with, the Shining
Path, a larger Maoist guerrilla movement.
   The Tupac Amaru guerrillas usually engage in urban sabotage
against property and have been considered less violent than the
Shining Path. It began as an urban guerrilla organization, but in
the last two years has expanded into rural areas.
   Estimates of the size of the group range from 500 to 1,500. A
government military patrol near the highland town of Jauja killed
68 Tupac Amaru guerrillas in late April.
   More than 14,000 people have been killed since the Shining Path
began its insurgency in 1980.

<HEAD>Four Haitians Detained For Attempted Hijacking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLEMSTAD, Curacao (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Haitians were in jail Thursday
on air piracy charges after trying to hijack to New York an
Antillean Airlines flight enroute from Haiti to this Dutch
Caribbean island.
   Police said the four were not armed when they attempted to
hijack ALM Flight 974 Wednesday night. The plane left Miami between
4 p.m. and 5 p.m. for Curacao, with a stopover in Haiti.
   ``They wanted to go to New York and were under the impression
that they were going to New York,'' the airline's spokesman Robin
Visser said Thursday. He said the plane's captain fooled the
hijackers into believing the airport in Curacao was really New York.
   Visser said Wednesday night that the hijackers ultimately wanted
to be flown to Israel.
   He said that after the plane left Haiti, a Haitian man told a
flight attendant he had put in a bathroom a box of explosives that
could be detonated by a Haitian army colonel in a submarine
somewhere in the Caribbean.
   After the Haitians were arrested in Curacao when the plane
arrived, the crew found a small box in the bathroom. Police said
Thursday they were still investigating its contents.
   Attorney General Robert Pietersz Thursday identified the group's
leader as Joseph Pierre Lamy, 37. He said the other three were a
29-year-old man and two women aged 27 and 35. He said he did not
know the names of the three.
   He said the four have been charged with air piracy and will be
tried in Curacao.
   He said they face a maximum sentence of 10 years. He said
authorities still have not determined the motive for the hijacking,
partly due to trouble communicating with the Haitians, who speak
only Creole and broken French.
   Visser said the DC-9 Super 80 returned to normal service
Thursday.
   He said one of the estimated 100 passengers was slightly injured
Wednesday night in the rush to leave the plane after the captain
ordered its immediate evacuation after landing.

<HEAD>Wright Says ``I Feel Liberated,'' but Leaving Bitterness Behind</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates and reorders thruout with Wright interview, comments
from Gingrich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright proclaimed himself
``liberated'' Thursday after his announcement he will resign from
Congress, while there were clear signs his leaving wouldn't end the
partisan bitterness that focused on his ethics case.
   Wright put the best face on his departure, blaming not only
Republicans for his downfall but also his own inner drive to do too
much too quickly, ``to make things happen in the way that you
believe in.''
   In a lengthy interview, he never suggested he had done anything
wrong.
   His likely successor, Majority Leader Thomas Foley of
Washington, was talking of ways to calm the fractious House and
cool vindictiveness left over from the Wright ethics case.
   ``I think we can turn this mood that has somehow affected the
institution a bit recently back to a strong and healthy one,'' said
Foley, who is virtually certain to be chosen speaker by Democratic
colleagues Tuesday when Wright relinquishes the job.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., was considered the favorite to
replace Foley as majority leader later on, but Rep. Ed Jenkins,
D-Ga., was also seeking fellow Democrats' support.
   Four prominent Democrats were working their House precinct for
the No. 3 spot, now held by Rep. Tony Coelho of California, who
said last weekend he will resign rather than face likely ethics
charges concerning his own financial dealilngs.
   The four: Reps. William Gray of Pennsylvania, David Bonior of
Michigan, Beryl Anthony of Arkansas and Henry Waxman of California.
   While Foley talked of peace, there was evidence a recent
eye-for-an-eye atmosphere was far from gone.
   Republicans circulated a private briefing paper advising their
colleagues on how to best use Wright's problems. In the favorite
argument of GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, Wright's chief
accuser, the paper contended the Democrats have problems because of
their 35-year tenure in control of the House.
   ``The Democrats in the House have grown arrogant with their
unchallenged power,'' the paper stated, suggesting that exploiting
ethics matters might be a way to help the GOP regain majority
status.
   John Buckley, a spokesman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said the GOP was ``fully prepared to take
advantage of the revelations about Democrats,' but he denied there
was any special campaign-style effort to dig up new dirt on the
opposition.
   House members said Thursday that Wright's resignation
announcement had relieved tension, but some also said it was being
replaced by anger _ much of it aimed at Gingrich.
   ``It's a World War I mentality, where anyone who sticks his head
out of the trench might get it shot at next,'' said Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif.
   Gingrich's case is likely to be the next to go before the ethics
panel. He is accused of putting together a partnership to promote a
book he wrote, a venture which employed his wife, and of violating
limits on outside income and prohibitions on receiving gifts over
$100 from people with a direct interest in legislation.
   The issues are strikingly parallel to the Wright case. Gingrich
denies any wrongdoing.
   The Georgian, who had kept silent since hearing Wright's
resignation speech, said Thursday that he had held his tongue at
first because ``I was so angry at the tone of his speech and some
of the things he said.''
   He said Wright's condemnation of ethics accusations and
investigations as ``mindless cannibalism'' was ``an insult to the
ethics committee and every decent person in the House. ... It was
not mindless, it was very serious.''
   Rep. John T. Myers, R-Ind., the senior GOP member of the ethics
committee, said he expected the panel still to act next week on
motions made by Wright's lawyers to dismiss the most serious
charges against him. He, too, said he resented Wright's comment.
   ``We're doing our job,'' he said. ``If a member has done wrong,
it's got to be investigated. I do not consider myself
cannibalistic. I resent that comment. ... I'm not going to be
intimidated.''
   Wright, meanwhile said ``I feel liberated'' and planned to ``do
a lot of things I enjoy in life and have been postponing _ to read,
reflect and be with friends in a leisurely setting.''
   He said he planned to do some writing, and some speaking ``if
invited.''
   And he said he hoped his resignation would lead to ``an
abatement of the stridency and the pettiness which has grown up
like weeds in our garden.;;
   In an interview in his office, Wright dated his misfortunes from
Nov. 13, 1987, when he attended a meeting between Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega and Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo in Washington.
   ``From that moment there was nothing but hostility from the
administration,'' Wright said. ``There was a determination on the
part of certain people in the other party to see to it that I was
removed.''
   He said he made up his mind to resign last weekend.
   ``It had come to me ... that it would be unreasonable to expect
to prevail upon the members of the (ethics) committee to see that
they had been in error,'' Wright said. ``Short of an all-out,
harsh, bitter fight on the House floor, it would be unrealistic to
expect a complete exoneration, which is all I was interested in. So
I decided that's one of those things I can't change.''
   During his time as speaker, he said, ``I was probably obsessed
with the notion that I had a limited period of time in which to
make my mark on the future. That was one of my attitudes, perhaps a
failing.''
   He said, ``There has to come an end, there must come an end'' to
the use of ethics as a political weapon. ``Do I believe that's
going to happen overnight because I said it? No, I do not.''

<HEAD>Christian Cabinet Praises Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Christian cabinet said Thursday it
welcomes the Arab League's plan to pursue a settlement of Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war, as the competing Moslem government had done
a week ago.
   Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian administration called for
``consolidating'' a cease-fire proclaimed by the Arab leaders last
Friday after a four-day summit in Morocco.
   Premier Salim Hoss, who heads the rival Moslem cabinet, approved
the summit's decisions hours after they were made. On Thursday, his
government recommended ``speeding up'' implementation of the
resolutions.
   The competing governments have existed since a political crisis
developed in September.
   Several formations of Israeli jets roared over Beirut after
sunset Thursday, drawing anti-aircraft fire from both Christian and
Moslem forces. Police said it may have been the first time Aoun's
gunners fired at Israeli warplanes, which have patrolled Lebanon
for years.
   Press reports said the siege of the Christian enclave east of
Beirut might be lifted next week because of the Arab League's
efforts.
   Moslem forces sealed off the 310-square-mile area soon after
artillery duels began March 8 between Aoun's Christian army units
and an alliance of Syrian troops and Druse militiamen.
   Although the Arab League declared a truce in April, Syrian
gunners have continued shelling the Christian coastline northeast
of Beirut to keep Aoun's forces from bringing in supplies.
   A statement issued after the Christian government's three-hour
meeting demanded the siege be lifted and said Aoun's 20,000
soldiers were willing to end their blockade of illegal ports run by
Moslem militias. The blockade was imposed March 6 and the artillery
war began two days later.
   Aoun's cabinet said it ``welcomes the wresting of the Lebanese
problem from Syria's monopolizing fist.''
   At the summit, King Hassan II of Morocco, King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia and the president of Algeria, Chadli Bendjedid, were
designated to find a settlement in Lebanon within six months.
   The Christian statement said the three leaders ``enjoy the
confidence and respect of the Lebanese people.''
   It said Christians would not discuss changes in the political
system, which the Moslem majority demands, until the Syrians
withdrew from Lebanon.
   Christians were the majority when Lebanon became independent of
France in 1943 and have dominated the government, military and
judiciary. Under an unwritten agreement, the president is
Christian, the premier Sunni Moslem and the parliament speaker
Shiite Moslem.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 and has become the main power
broker during the long civil war.
   Not long after the artillery battles began, Aoun declared a
``war of liberation'' against the Syrians. The statement Thursday
said: ``The Lebanese people ... can freely express their opinions
in reforming their domestic affairs ... only after the removal of
the occupation.''
   Also included in the statement was an accusation that Syria was
behind a plot to kill Aoun.
   It called the plot ``a clear symbol of Syrian terrorism ... to
eliminate the head of the legal authority.''
   The Christian government said it would seek the extradition from
Cyprus of six Lebanese arrested in Larnaca, Cyprus, last Friday
with a large cache of weapons, including anti-aircraft missiles.
The Moslem cabinet also has requested extradition.
   One of the six told a court hearing they had planned to shoot
down a helicopter carrying Aoun to Cyprus. Aoun was expected to
pass through Larnaca on his way to the Arab summit, but did not
attend the meeting.

   Private exporters report that China has bought
an additional 100,000 metric tons of soft red winter wheat, raising
its total tonnage for the new marketing year to 850,000, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Previous purchases for delivery in the year that began June 1
were announced earlier this week and last. In April, China bought
300,000 tons of wheat under the Export Enhancement Program, which
is a government subsidy that discounts the purchase.
   The Agriculture Department estimated the price of the
non-subsidized 550,000 tons of wheat to be about $82.5 million.
   During the last marketing year, China bought 8.3 million metric
tons of wheat, said a department statistician, who noted that the
recent purchases were large for so short a time period.
   Exporters are required to report to USDA export sales of 100,000
metric tons or more of one commodity to a single customer on a
single day.

<HEAD>New Trial Service Will Let Coin Callers Leave Message</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pay telephone users in Columbus, Ohio, will be
able to leave messages on local coin calls if they reach a busy or
unanswered number this summer, telephone executives said Thursday.
   The voice messaging capability will be available on selected pay
phones operated by Ohio Bell, according to Ameritech Services Inc.,
which said it was the first time any of the seven regional Bell
companies has offered such a service.
   If a caller reaches a busy signal or unanswered phone, he or she
will be asked by a computerized voice if, for an additional charge,
they wish to leave a message. After the caller deposits an
additional 25 cents, the computer then records the caller's
message, and attempts to send it every 15 minutes for as long as
two hours if a busy signal was reached.
   For an unanswered number, the computer will send the message
every 30 minutes for as long as four hours, Ameritech said.
   ``Callers don't have to push any buttons or read any
instructions,'' said Jim Hollingsworth, an Ameritech official.
   If the trial is deemed successful, the service will be offered
in 1990 in the five states Ameritech serves, Hollingsworth said.
   Ameritech is the Chicago-based parent of Bell companies serving
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEAD>South African Pleads Guilty After Hijacking Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South African was sentenced
Thursday to 30 years in jail on charges he tried to force an
airplane reportedly carrying black guerrillas to fly to his country.
   Police and court officials have identified the South African,
Dunley Richard Stacely, as one of two men held for investigation of
a May 18 attempted hijacking of a Soviet Aeroflot jet to
Johannesburg. The plane was en route from Luanda, Angola, to Dar es
Salaam.
   Many details of the incident remain sketchy. Unconfirmed reports
have said the African National Congress, the leading guerrilla
group fighting the South African government, chartered the jet to
transport its members evacuating bases in Angola.
   Authorities in South Africa have denied responsibility, but
security officials there have blamed the hijacking attempt on
disgruntled guerrillas who wanted to return home.
   It is not known if Stacely was a member of South Africa's
security forces.
   He pleaded guilty Thursday before High Court Judge Nasoro
Mnzavas to charges of endangering and injuring passengers. The
judge first ordered journalists and spectators out of the courtroom.
   Court officials have identified Stacely as a 30-year-old white
South African. One official said Stacely admitted taking hand
grenades, explosives and detonators aboard the jet.
   A police officer in Dar es Salaam said Soviet guards on the
plane shot and injured a would-be hijacker who demanded the jet fly
to Johannesburg because a ``Russian communist wanted in South
Africa'' was aboard. A crew member was also reported injured.
   A court official said another South African faces similar
charges.
   Oliver Tambo, president of the African National Congress, has
acknowledged his group was evacuating bases in Angola.
   Pressed by journalists to address the reports that his group
chartered the jet, Tambo said only, ``It is a serious matter for
anybody to try and hijack a plane to Johannesburg with ANC members
on board, even four.''
   His group is the largest African nationalist group fighting the
South African government and its apartheid policy of racial
discrimination. The Congress is banned in South Africa and
maintains headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia.
   The Soviet Embassy in Dar es Salaam has refused to discuss the
hijacking attempt.

   Actor Jason Robards and author Alex Haley are
going to try to persuade Bell Atlantic customers they need
``intelligent'' telephone services that can tell them who's calling
before they answer and automatically dial whoever called while they
were in the shower.
   Beginning this week, Robards and Haley will be featured in an
advertising campaign in which they extoll the virtues of Bell
Atlantic's ``Intelligent networQ'' of phone services for businesses
and homes, Bell Atlantic said Thursday.
   The system can display the number of a caller before you answer;
dial back that caller who hung up before you were able to reach the
phone; and screen out people you don't want to talk to. It also
will give customers distinctive rings for certain calls and have as
many as three different telephone numbers ring on one phone.
   ``It will change the way people live and do business by making
communication simpler and easier,'' Christopher E. Clouser, Bell
Atlantic's vice president for corporate relations and advertising,
said of the advanced communications system. ``To convey this
revolutionary concept to consumers we chose two well-known and
well-respected communications experts _ a noted author and an
actor.''
   Haley wrote the book, ``Roots,'' while Robards has had a long
motion picture, television and stage career.
   Bell Atlantic is not the first company to offer these so-called
class services, and to date the public has not rushed out to
embrace them.
   Bell Atlantic's New Jersey subsidiary, New Jersey Bell, began
making such services available in early 1988 but has signed up only
2.4 percent of its 1.3 million customers, The Wall Street Journal
reported last month.
   The newspaper said Southwestern Bell began testing the services
last July in Muskogee, Okla., but despite a heavy promotional
campaign signed up only 7 percent of its customers.
   An earlier generation of custom services have had some success.
After more than a decade, 28.8 percent of Bell customers have call
waiting, 10 percent have call forwarding, and 7.4 percent have
three-way calling.
   Critics say answering machines essentially screen calls or
identify or block unwanted calls. But the phone companies say their
way is easier and more efficient.
   Philadephia-based Bell Atlantic is the parent company of New
Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone serving
Delaware and the Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Cos., which serve
Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>Jury Deliberations Begin in Trial of W.Va.'s Biggest Bank Robbery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury deliberations began Thursday in
the bank robbery trial of two men, one of whom is also accused of
murdering a gang member to keep him from testifying.
   John P. McCoy, 43, of Slaters Branch, and David Doyle Moore, 27,
of Lovely, are accused of robbing the Matewan National Bank branch
at Kermit on Jan. 3, 1987, making off with $286,000 in what was
West Virginia's largest bank robbery. The pair also is charged with
threatening federal witnesses.
   McCoy is also charged with shooting to death Russell M. Davis,
who was allegedly part of the robbery gang, because he talked to
investigators.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Carey said in closing arguments that
testimony linked McCoy to the robbery, the threats and the death of
Davis.
   Carey said Moore stole the getaway car, took part in the robbery
and went with McCoy to make threats against at least one witness.
   ``You will find that they're not only guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt. They're guilty beyond any doubt,'' Carey said.
   That account was rebutted by defense attorney Roy Hampton,
appointed last Monday to represent McCoy, who previously had
refused government help.
   Hampton said the key government witness, Harold D. ``Boonie''
Runyon, lacked credibility and had changed his story since talking
to the grand jury in an attempt to avoid Kentucky's electric chair.
   Runyon pleaded guilty two weeks ago to killing Davis on a
mountaintop in Kentucky. He charged that McCoy killed Davis with a
shot to the head after Runyon had shot Davis three times in the
back, and testified he had helped bury another man in a separate
incident in Kentucky.
   ``Mr. Runyon was involved in another murder. This is the kind of
person the government is asking you to believe,'' Hampton said.
   J. William Curtis, representing Moore, said the government made
a mistake in its opening argument in saying that it would prove his
client stole a vehicle for the getaway.
   ``He's guilty of no more than being friends with John P.
McCoy,'' Curtis said.
   A jewelry store operator said Moore purchased more than $2,000
in jewelry the afternoon of the robbery, but Curtis said the
jeweler's recollection was wrong. Other witnesses in the trial said
Moore also bought a used car the day of the robbery.
   The trial in federal court began last week under tight security
because of the alleged threats against witnesses. The courtroom
halls were lined with a metal detector, an X-ray machine and a
handful of federal agents.
   The jury was given the case Thursday afternoon and the judge
immediately recessed proceedings until Friday morning.

<HEAD>European Mission Leaves Kosovo; 80 Students Detained</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fact-finding mission from the
European Parliament abandoned efforts to check on human rights
abuses reported in Kosovo province and left Belgrade on Thursday,
its task unfulfilled, a member said.
   Danish deputy Frode Kristoffersen said authorities thwarted
attempts by the five-member delegation to meet ethnic Albanian
dissidents.
   A senior police officer in Pristina, capital of the troubled
southern province, said after the detention of about 80 students on
Thursday that police in Kosovo are determined to quell further
unrest. He said police raided Pristina university dormitories early
Thursday, detaining suspected leaders of the unrest.
   The action prompted most of the 4,500 students to leave the
university hostels for home in fear of reprisals.
   The students had defied emergency measures forbidding
demonstrations in the province to protest alleged harassment of
ethnic Albanians by Yugoslav authorities.
   ``We are leaving with our task unfulfilled and with a feeling of
frustration because we were not given a chance to meet with people
in Kosovo who hold opinions which differ from official ones,''
Kristoffersen said.
   ``We will recommend that another European delegation visit
Kosovo this fall to further study the situation.''
   A state of emergency was proclaimed in Kosovo two months ago
when 60,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated to protest constitutional
changes limiting self-government here and giving the republic of
Serbia, of which Kosovo is a part, a greater say in Kosovo's
affairs.
   Serbian authorities said the measures were needed to prevent
persecution of the Slav minority by ethnic Albanians, who make up
85 percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million inhabitants.
   At least 24 people, including two policemen, died in rioting
that followed adoption of the amendments. About 900 ethnic
Albanians were arrested for their part in the protests, and 237
others were detained without trial in Serbia and Kosovo.
   On Tuesday and Wednesday, during the European mission's visit,
thousands of students gathered around their dormitories to demand
the release of Albanians arrested in previous unrest. Police broke
up the protest Wednesday night with tear gas and baton charges.
   One person was reported killed in an exchange of gunfire when
demonstrators confronted police Tuesday in nearby Podujevo.
   Premier Ante Markovic had met the parliamentarians mission and
promised he would have six Kosovo deputies who voted against the
controversial legislation flown to Belgrade. But regional
authorities foiled the plan. Kristoffersen said his group rejected
an offer to see two other deputies instead.
   The delegation returned to Belgrade Wednesday, cutting short its
planned three-day visit to the province.
   The federal republic of Yugoslavia comprises the six republics
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia
and Slovenia, and the two autonomous provinces of Kosovo and
Vojvodina.
   The Belgrade daily Borba reported Thursday that a band of about
15 ``heavily armed members of the Albanian chauvinist and
separatist movement'' from villages around Podujevo are hiding in a
forest, ``ready for anything.'' It said these ``terrorists'' twice
blew up high-voltage power lines in the area and wrote ``enemy
slogans'' calling on the Albanian population ``to take up arms and
rise against Yugoslavia and the republic of Serbia.''

<HEAD>Panel Rules U.S. Violated International Trade Rules on Sugar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international panel has backed an
Australian charge that the United States violated trading rules by
limiting its imports of sugar, the office of U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills said Thursday.
   Last week Ms. Hills cited Japan, Brazil and India as
unreasonably limiting exports from the United States. She acted
under a new U.S. trade law, with the approval of President Bush.
   Christina McCowan, a press officer for Ms. Hills, said the
ruling on sugar will come up at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland on
June 21. The scene will be a meeting of the council of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which is an international
organization as well as an agreement.
   GATT permits restrictions on imports only if the importing
country restricts its own production in the same proportion. It is
considered unfair for the limit on imports to be used just as a way
to protect the importing country's own industry or farmers.
   ``We've been increasing our production while cutting our
imports,'' said Tom Hammer, president of the U.S. Sweetener Users
Association.
   American users of sweeteners and sugar exporters in other
countries say the price of sugar in the United States is kept
unreasonably high by government action to protect a small number of
U.S. farmers. The U.S. government last year raised its price to 23
cents a pound. Raw cane sugar sells at about 11 cents a pound on
the world market.
   Hammer said U.S. imports of sugar have been reduced from $1.1
billion worth in 1982 to about $400 million last year. Quotas
specifying how much sugar may be sold in this country are
distributed among 38 countries, including Australia.
   Canada, Argentina and the 12 countries of the European Economic
Community joined Australia in filing a complaint last year. The
panel that ruled against the United States consisted of Poland,
Uruguay and Hong Kong.
   Under GATT rules, the United States or any of the other 96
member governments in the organization could block acceptance of
the sugar panel's ruling. In recent years, however, the United
States and Japan have accepted some adverse rulings. The United
States has been in the forefront of a successful movement to
tighten the system for settling disputes under GATT.
   In two other pending cases the administration has accepted an
adverse ruling but no change has been made in the practises
complained of, because Congress had not acted to change the law.
   GATT rules also call for the country found in violation to offer
compensation to the country whose exports have been restricted.
Compensation usually takes the form of a reduced tariff in the
country found at fault on other goods of the complaining country,
or some measure that also increases the complaining country's
exports.

<HEAD>Michel Joins Democrat Gray in Protesting Leaks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel asked the
attorney general Thursday to ``weigh very carefully'' Democratic
Rep. William Gray's request for an independent counsel into leaked
information leading to stories that Gray is under federal
investigation.
   Michel, sounding as angry as Gray about the leaks, wrote
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, ``I must believe that you are as
upset as I am over any improper disclosure of information.''
   Gray, the fourth-ranking Democrat who is running for the No. 3
majority whip's position, also continued on the offensive in
denying reports that he had had any absentee workers on his payroll.
   Government sources, speaking only on condition they not be
named, said there is a preliminary inquiry into allegations of
employment practices and expenditures on Gray's staff, including
allegations that the lawmaker hired a ``ghost'' employee.
   ``There are and were no `ghost', `no-show' or `absentee'
emplouyees on my House or committee payrolls,'' said Gray, who was
chairman of the House Budget Committee prior to the current
congressional session.
   Gray has asked Thornburgh to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate the leaks ``and the motivations of this so-called
investigation arranged to occur just as I was seeking a leadership
position in the Democratic Party.''
   He called Thornburgh's promise to have an in-house
investigatiion ``insufficient.''
   Gray also gave reporters affidavits from all his employees, who
provided details on the work they do for Congress.
   Michel, R-Ill., told Thornburgh he was ``very dismayed'' to hear
news reports of allegations against Gray, ``which were apparently
based on information from the Justice Department investigators and
the office of the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia. It is just hard to
imagine anything more irreponsible.''
   He said if there ``is the slightest doubt that a complete
investigation cannot be completed, then I urge you to weigh very
seriously the request you apparently have for an independent
investigation.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said, ``We have
confidence that this matter can be investigated here in this
department.''
   ``Previously, the attorney general has made known his views of
independent counsels to the point of suspending the order which
would have, ironically, provided for the appointment of independent
counsels for some of these matters that have been subject of
leaks,'' Runkel said.
   Runkel was referring to an order issued by Thornburgh's
predecessor, Edwin Meese III, mandating appointment of independent
counsels for investigations of members of Congress.

   In another attack on official history, two
deputies told the Soviet Congress on Thursday the Baltic republics
were taken by force and the approved version that they joined the
Soviet Union voluntarily is a lie.
   Other stinging commentary during the session included an attack
on Poliburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, who was accused of being
incompetent to run Soviet agriculture and end chronic food
shortages.
   Dissident historian Roy Medvedev took the podium during
nationally televised debate and said the official version of Soviet
absorption of the three Baltic republics in 1940 was not true.
   ``Up to now, in our history books, we have said Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania voluntarily joined the Soviet Union and that it was a
popular revolution, there was no violence and it was a declaration
of free will,'' he told the deputies.
   That, Medvedev said, was ``a lie.''
   Many deputies reacted with noisy anger and denials. Then
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared his support for an
investigation of the allegations, and the 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies assented without a vote.
   Gorbachev also implied the Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939, which
doomed Baltic sovereignty, might be a forgery.
   He said neither the Soviet Union nor West Germany possesses an
original. ``There are copies _ of what I do not know,'' Gorbachev
said.
   One cause for skepticism, he told the assembly, is the fact that
Vyacheslav Molotov's signature on the copy is in German rather than
Russian. Molotov, then foreign minister, negotiated the
non-aggression treaty with his German counterpart, Joachim von
Ribbentrop.
   Latvian deputy Jemma Skulma said later the original is not
needed to prove the Soviets used force. ``I was there,'' the
graying artist said.
   Gorbachev said he did not believe Baltic charges _ with which
Western historians agree _ that Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin divided Poland and gave the Baltics to
the Soviet Union in a secret part of the agreement.
   He said he supported an investigation ``because the Baltics are
in turmoil discussing these matters, and it is doubted that there
was a desire of the people to join the Soviet Union.''
   It is a burning issue in Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, where
tens of thousands of people were deported and died in the 1940s and
1950s. Mass movements in the republics are using Gorbachev's
reforms to press for independence.
   The United States never recognized the Soviet takeover of the
Baltic states and still accredits their old embassies in Washington.
   Behind the scenes, economist Mihhail Bronstein of Estonia said
Gorbachev offered his support to Estonia's economic plan to
legalize small-scale private property and give itself control of
its industry and resources.
   During the session, heads swiveled toward Ligachev as deputy
Yuri D. Chernichenko took the podium and began his scathing
assessment of Ligachev's performance as head of a new party
commission on agriculture. Ligachev, a conservative who is
considered a rival to Gorbachev, sat impassively with other members
of the ruling Poliburo.
   Such remarks were never heard in the old parliament, the Supreme
Soviet, which even party leaders and parliamentarians now admit was
a mere rubber-stamp body.
   ``Why is this politically significant branch, the branch which
determines the future, ruled by a person who does not understand
anything about it and who failed in the field of ideology?''
Chernichenko asked.
   Ligachev was named head of the commission in September after
being relieved of the ideology portfolio, the position that once
made him the No. 2 Kremlin leader.
   Nothing in Ligachev's background marks him as a specialist on
farming. He attended an institute on aircraft construction.
   Because of the nation's dependence on imports of consumer goods
and food, it has the reputation of an ``international sponger,''
said Chernichenko, a television commentator who specializes in
agriculture and rural issues.
   Expensive projects in a deficit-ridden economy also were a
common complaint Thursday, and some of Gorbachev's reforms came
under attack.
   Deputy Vitaly Kanishev received wild applause when he said new
private cooperatives ``not only get their hands into our pockets,
they undress us and want to kill us too.''
   ``How much does the maintenance of 18 million bureaucrats cost,
and the war in Afghanistan, support for Cuba, Nicaragua,
Ethiopia?'' asked deputy Vasily Belov. ``How much is the space
program? How much are our grandiose festivals, Olympic games,
various forums?''
   Nearly 50 deputies led by populist Boris Yeltsin and economist
Gavril Popov proposing increasing the minimum pension to 80 rubles,
or $121, a month.
   They also called for a system of guaranteeing of food products
at state prices to retirees, invalids and families with incomes of
less than $106 a month per person.
   The inaugural session of the Congress was to have ended
Wednesday, but more than 500 people were still seeking the floor
Thursday, and the state broadcasting authority said it would
continue its live broadcasts of the proceedings next week.

<TEXT>
   The United States is continuing to press
Thailand about repatriating some 270 of its citizens who work at a
Libyan chemical weapons production plant, State Department sources
said Thursday.
   So far, the Thai government has refused to take action on the
U.S. requests, which have been made over the past several months.
   ``We've made our concerns known through the appropriate
officials ... and not at a low level,'' said the official, who
spoke on condition of not being identified by name.
   There are estimates that between 25,000 and 75,000 Thais work in
Libya. Workers from many Asian nations have sought employment in
the Middle East, where they can obtain higher-paying jobs than in
their homelands.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has threatened action against
other Thais in Libya if the workers at the chemical plant leave.
   The plant has been identified by U.S. officials as the largest
single chemical weapons facility in the Third World.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher, asked about the
matter, said the United States has often expressed its concern
about the plant, and ``called on all nations to ensure that their
firms and individuals are not contributing to the Libyan chemical
weapons program.''
   ``The Royal Thai government is well aware of our views on this
issue and is aware, as many other governments are, of our serious
concerns about the presence of workers at Rabta, including Thai
workers,'' Boucher said.
   The spokesman refused to confirm that there have been repeated
U.S. requests of late on the matter, saying only, ``We've had
discussions with the Thai government, as well as other governments,
and we hope that the Thai government and other governments will
continue to take action to deny foreign support to this plant.''

<TEXT>
   A man who has been a suspect since 1971 in
the shooting deaths of his wife, mother and three children was
arrested Thursday, less than two weeks after the show ``America's
Most Wanted'' featured the case.
   John List, 63, who had been living under an assumed name, was
arrested without incident at his job in Richmond, Va., said FBI
agent Terry T. O'Connor of the bureau's Richmond office.
   List, who has been working as an accountant under the name
Robert P. Clark, was positively identified through fingerprints,
O'Connor said. He was charged with five counts of first-degree
murder and was being held at the Henrico County Jail. U.S.
Magistrate David G. Lowe scheduled a bond hearing for Monday.
   On or about Nov. 9, 1971, List is believed to have shot and
killed his mother, wife and three children at his Westfield, N.J.,
home, authorities allege. The bodies were not discovered until Dec.
7, 1971, after neighbors saw light bulbs burning out in the house
and summoned police. The neighbors had presumed the Lists were on
vacation when they hadn't seen them for a month.
   List left a five-page letter confessing to the murders of
Patricia, 16, John Jr., 15, Frederick, 13, his wife, Helen, 45, and
mother, Alma, 85. All had been shot with a 9mm automatic or a
.22-caliber pistol.
   After the slayings, investigators found that List had two
mortgages on his house, was failing as a financial consultant and
had been siphoning money from his mother's $200,000 savings account.
   As many as 20 FBI agents worked on the case. There were numerous
leads, but authorities said the trail went cold six years ago.
   But since the case was featured May 21 on Fox-TV's ``America's
Most Wanted'' program, the FBI received more than 200 tips,
including one that said a man named Bob Clark who resembled List
was living in Midlothian, a Richmond suburb, O'Connor said.
   After receiving the tip, FBI agents went to List's home and
questioned his wife, whom he met at a Lutheran church event in the
Denver area in 1977 and married four years ago. Her name was being
withheld.
   ``She has been very cooperative,'' said John C. McGinley, head
of the FBI's Newark office. ``She was unaware of his background.''
   McGinley said agents determined Clark was their man because,
like List, he had a scar behind his right ear.
   A man at the accounting firm of Maddrea, Joyner, Kirkham &amp; Woody
said List worked there as a staff accountant.
   ``He was a nice fellow, almost too nice to be true,'' said the
man, who would not reveal his name. ``He even had a Fraternal Order
of Police sticker on his car.''
   At his arraignment, the former fugitive spoke in a low, husky
voice as he asked Lowe for a court-appointed attorney. The
magistrate refused the request, noting that List earned $2,000 a
month as an accountant and had about $1,200 in a bank account.
   List later retained an attorney, Joel G. Clarke of Richmond.
``He can't talk to anybody,'' Clarke told reporters outside the
jail.
   Westfield's former police chief, James Moran, said he expected
List to be caught only after the case became nationally known
through television or newspapers. Moran said he still carried a
wanted poster of List with him.
   ``I'll gladly tear it up now,'' he said.

   A self-described African National
Congress guerrilla testified Thursday that police recruited ANC
defectors, put them in small units and sent them on missions to
kill suspected members of the ANC.
   In other developments on Thursday:
   _Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other anti-apartheid church leaders
asked foreign bankers to refuse to reschedule South Africa's debt
payments unless the white-dominated government makes major
political concessions. An interim debt agreement expires on June
30, 1990, and South Africa faces payments of at least $8 billion by
1991 unless new terms are established.
   _Black labor leader Donsie Khumalo, who staged a 26-hour sit-in
at the British Embassy on March 29-30 to protest restrictions
placed on him by police, was arrested Thursday for violating those
restrictions, police said. They said that during the sit-in,
Khumalo did not report twice daily to a police station, was not at
his home at night, and did not restrict his political activities.
   At a highly publicized terrorism trial at Cape Town Supreme
Court, Bongani Jonas testified that he heard of two
police-recruited assassination units, known as the Askari group, or
the A-Team, after he was shot and arrested by an A-Team member near
Cape Town on Sept. 17, 1987.
   He said A-Team members boasted they carried out killings of
suspected ANC members in Botswana and black townships outside Cape
Town.
   Jonas testified that after he was arrested, police interrogated
him for hours, periodically jumping on his leg that had been
fractured by a bullet.
   He said A-Team members were among the interrogators and tried to
recruit him to the police unit, saying he would receive a house if
he joined.
   Jonas said he pretended to cooperate because he feared the
authorities would kill him. He said he told police he would join
the A-Team and testify against 14 suspected ANC members accused of
bombings in Cape Town.
   But when Jonas was called as a state witness in April, he
refused to testify, saying he remained loyal to the ANC, the
outlawed guerrilla group trying to undermine the white-dominated
government.
   ``The struggle for freedom is the law of nature, and to act
against the law of nature is to act against God himself,'' Jonas
told the court Thursday. ``That I will never do.''
   The 14 defendants include men, women, blacks, whites and people
of mixed-race. One white defendant is the daughter of a top-ranking
university administrator.
   Jonas has not been charged in the case. He testified Thursday to
explain why he decided not to serve as a state witness.

<HEAD>Mayor Cisneros, Once Considered The Hope of Hispanics, Leaves Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Henry Cisneros, who became one of the
country's most visible Hispanic leaders only to see his eight-year
term beclouded by scandal and personal problems, finished his last
day of work Thursday.
   Cisneros, 41, cleared out his desk and turned the job over to
his predecessor, Lila Cockrell, who last month was elected again to
the post she held from 1975 to 1981. She officially took over
Thursday afternoon.
   In recent months, Cisneros' marital problems _ he admitted being
in love with another woman _ and the highly publicized reports of
his son's ill health forced the usually outspoken mayor into a
lower profile.
   Citing such personal problems, Cisneros announced last fall he
would not run for a fifth term.
   But friends and colleagues say Cisneros will be remembered for
working hard and bringing acclaim and businesses to the city.
   ``There's no question he has left his mark on San Antonio, but
he certainly has not ridden off into the sunset,'' said longtime
friend Rep. Hugo Berlanga. After six years as a councilman and
eight more as mayor, Cisneros plans to join an asset management
firm in San Antonio.
   ``I suppose the thing that I'm proudest of is having worked with
San Antonians to raise our sense of the city's role and to overcome
the kind of inward-looking tendencies,'' Cisneros said in a
newspaper interview.
   ``Some of the things I wanted to do in terms of clearance of
entire blocks and replacing them with new housing in the central
city have not yet occurred,'' Cisneros said.
   The Ivy League-educated San Antonio native, who still lives in
his grandfather's house, is credited with helping break down racial
barriers between Hispanics and Anglos and inspiring a generation of
young Hispanics to finish school and join the professional ranks.
   ``He bridged the gap between ethnic groups in a very articulate
and charismatic way,'' said City Councilman Weir Labatt.
   ``He has the charisma and the presence that very few people
have,'' said Texas House Speaker Gib Lewis. ``When Henry Cisneros
walks into a room, he reminds me of John Connally when he was
governor. Throughout his political career, everyone stopped and
noticed. Henry Cisneros has that.''
   Cisneros brought national prominence to San Antonio when he was
rumored to be a vice presidential contender in 1984. He worked to
develop a better bus system, a stronger economic base, and other
community projects.
   During his tenure, the city's general expenditures grew from
$184 million in 1981 to $257 million last year. Tourism revenues
grew from $654 million in 1980 to a projected $1.5 billion this
year. And the number of jobs in San Antonio increased from 781,200
in 1980 to more than 1 million in 1988, with the addition of 13 new
major employers.
   But his political future remains uncertain.
   ``I have no plan, no timetable, no deadline, no office in
mind,'' Cisneros said.

<HEAD>Invalid Duarte Hangs On For Succession</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Exhausted by cancer, calamity
and revolution, President Jose Napoleon Duarte completed on
Thursday what may be his greatest victory _ peacefully turning his
government over to an elected successor.
   He yielded power to Alfredo Cristiani, the new president who
represents Duarte's nemesis on the right wing.
   Duarte's closest political adviser, commenting on condition his
name not be used, said that with the president's ebbing strength,
Duarte is given to reflecting on the fruits of his crusade for
democracy in El Salvador.
   ``He feels ambivalent, because he began by taking power away
from the oligarchy and now it may seem he's handing it back,'' the
adviser told The Associated Press.
   ``He is aware of the irony in the fact that handing power to the
most disagreeable political opposition will consolidate the
democratic process he has dedicated his life to building.''
   The adviser, an old friend and fellow founder of the Christian
Democratic Party, sees Duarte almost daily. Though he has no
government post, he became the main architect of the transition.
   He described how Duarte has had to lie in an oxygen tent, wasted
by dehydrating vomiting and diarrhea. Like the ulcers in Duarte's
mouth, they are brought on by chemotherapy.
   The 63-year-old engineer-turned-politician is likely to be
remembered as crucial to a gradual and difficult replacement of an
authoritarian, semifeudal system of government with an incipient
democracy.
   But he approached the end of his term and his life burdened by
failures and compromises that will weigh heavily as history
deliberates its verdict.
   Duarte has terminal liver cancer. Since it was diagnosed in June
1988, he has made periodic trips to Walter Reed Army Medical Center
in Washington for treatment, which leaves him bedridden.
   With rest and intravenous nourishment, he overcame the previous
bouts of chemotherapy and returned to government.
   His doctor, Jose Luis Saca, told the AP the latest round of
chemotherapy was particularly devastating. Duarte is given little
or no chance of reaching his 64th birthday, in November.
   Duarte considers himself to a great degree personally
responsible for conditions permitting the unprecedented succession,
and sees it as a crowning achievement.
   But he also considers Cristiani's Republican Nationalist
Alliance, or Arena, an authoritarian, antidemocratic party inclined
to erode gains in human rights and civil liberties.
   ``One must acknowledge President Duarte's democratic vocation,''
said Cristiani in an interview with foreign correspondents before
taking office. ``He has, with his aptitudes and positions, promoted
democracy. But I wouldn't go so far as to call him the father of
Salvadoran democracy.''
   A summation of Duarte's five-year term includes notable
expansion of freedom of expression, drastic reduction in
politically motivated murders, labor union pluralism and three
nationwide elections judged free and fair by international
observers.
   But his two main objectives _ ending civil war and reviving a
moribund economy _ remained at least as far from fulfillment as
when he took office.
   Marxist-led guerrillas have been waging a revolution against the
U.S.-backed government for nine years. Despite more than $3.5
billion in economic and military aid from Washington, the rebels
continue to dominate a wide swath of territory in the north and
east.
   Though the 7,000 insurgents are outnumbered eight-to-one by
security forces, they have demonstrated the capacity to attack
major garrisons and keep the army on the defensive in much of the
Massachusetts-sized country.
   The economy is a shambles. El Salvador would be virtually
bankrupt without international help. Production of the major export
crops _ coffee, sugar and cotton _ has declined sharply along with
private investment and the standard of living.
   Health care, potable water and primary education are little more
than dreams for most of the rural population. Corruption and
nepotism within Duarte's administration are either rampant or
widespread, depending on who is making the assessment.
   The judiciary is all but completely ineffective. Though death
squad activity has declined, politically motivated assassins
continue to murder with impunity.
   Duarte, aware of the gravity of his disease, offered in last
year's state-of-the-republic address a sort of balance sheet on his
presidency.
   ``The will of my people has caused me to navigate seas each day
more stormy and more dangerous because of cross-currents. The
absence of fair winds and persistent adversity all along the route
have joined to prevent us from bringing about our high aims,'' he
said.
   A high-ranking U.S. diplomat, who has been in El Salvador for
most of Duarte's term, remarked, ``He didn't work miracles, so he
has taken a lot of knocks, some fair and some not. He was not a
great administrator. He merged the party and the government and
surrounded himself with some unscrupulous people. But he must be
credited with instituting the democratic system itself. His great
legacy is this transition. The rest pales by comparison.''
   The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Ignacio Ellacuria, a Roman Catholic priest who is rector of the
prestigious Central American University, agreed that Duarte
fostered what the academian termed ``formal democratic liberties.''
   ``But he never realized what little real power he had. He's not
a false man, but he is a man who is self-deceived. His hands were
completely tied by the United States and the armed forces.
   ``Obviously, he has governed amid much danger and difficulty.
The FMLN was against him, private enterprise was against him, the
media were against him, Arena was against him. So he had to take
refuge in the armed forces and the United States,'' said Ellacuria.
   The FMLN are the Spanish initials for the rebel Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front.
   Ellacuria harshly criticized Duarte for presiding over a junta
in 1981-82, the years of most ferocious repression during which
death squads and the military were blamed for abducting and
murdering up to 700 suspected leftists each month.
   ``Duarte accepted thousands of murders with the facile argument
that, if he were not there (on the junta), there would be more.
That is a measure of this man's ambition for power.''

<HEAD>Strong Thunderstorms Roll Through Upper Ohio Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain fell from Oklahoma and Louisiana to northern Indiana
on Thursday as thunderstorms developed along a broad cold front
stretching from Texas across the lower Great Lakes.
   A heat wave, meanwhile, toppled temperature records along the
East Coast.
   Thunderstorms were scattered from western Oklahoma and
north-central Texas across northern Illinois to northern Ohio on
Thursday afternoon.
   Hail as big as golf balls and torrential rains fell in northern
Indiana, flooding expressways and campgrounds, knocking out power
to thousands of residents and pushing rivers and streams beyond
their banks.
   Flash flood watches also were posted in southern Lower Michigan
and northern Ohio.
   Thunderstorms brought showers from eastern Texas to the central
Gulf Coast. The Southeast had widely scattered showers and
thunderstorms, while sunny skies prevailed in the West and
north-central states.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT
included more than an inch at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma
City, eight-tenths of an inch at Lafayette, La., and South Bend,
Ind., and seven-tenths of an inch at Houston.
   Temperatures reaching or breaking records for the date included
98 in Baltimore, 94 in Greer, S.C., 94 in Newark, N.J., 95 in
Raleigh, N.C., 95 in Richmond, Va., and 92 at Washington-Dulles
International Airport. Huron, S.D., tied its low for the date of 36
degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 52
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 98 degrees at Fort Belvoir,
Va. The low for the nation Thursday morning was 24 degrees at
Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Friday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms across much of the nation east of the Rockies, with
showers and thunderstorms most likely from Oklahoma to Ohio and
West Virginia. The West was expected to have fair to partly sunny
skies.
   Temperatures were predicted to reach the 90s in the Southwest
deserts and from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas to the southern
Atlantic Coast, and the 70s from New England to the upper
Mississippi Valley and from the northern and central Plains to
Washington. Highs elsewhere were expected in the 80s.

   The army began issuing computerized plastic
identity cards to Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip on
Thursday to try to increase its control over the rebellious
population.
   In Jerusalem, tens of thousands of Israelis gathered at the
sacred Western Wall in the Old City in a show of solidarity marking
the 22nd anniversary of Israel's capture of Arab east Jerusalem.
   Israel TV quoted police as saying that about 40,000 people, many
waving Israeli flags, came to the plaza facing the Wall, the last
remnant of the ancient Jewish Temple and Judaism's holiest site.
   The identity card program in the Gaza Strip will force Gazans to
show the cards on leaving and re-entering the territory via army
checkpoints, media reports said.
   Government officials have said they also expect the system to be
used in the West Bank.
   The new Gaza Strip identity cards have imbedded magnetic strips.
A senior military official refused comment on media reports that
the cards would be run through computer readers at army checkpoints.
   Women as well as children under 16 are exempt and can continue
using their old identity cards, the official said. He said he
expected between 70,000 and 80,000 Gazans to apply for the new
cards, most of them because they work in Israel.
   Last month, the army ordered all 50,000 Gazans working in Israel
to return to their homes for a week, and several municipal
governments and some Israeli factories launched campaigns to
replace Arab workers with Jews.
   The latest move coincided with a demand by Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir that the army adopt harsher measures to end the
nearly 18-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel captured the territories, home to 1.7 million
Palestinians, from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
The rebellion has left 503 Palestinians and 22 Israelis dead.
   ``A way must be found to liquidate the intefadeh,'' Shamir was
quoted by the daily Yediot Ahronot as telling Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin in a private meeting Wednesday. ``Intefadeh'' is
Arabic for uprising.
   Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir confirmed that Shamir sought a
tougher approach by the military but declined to give details. He
insisted Israel would maintain a policy of inflicting ``the minimum
possible bloodshed.''
   The Jewish ceremony in the Old City began with a prayer, and
then plaza lights were put out and a giant image of the Star of
David was projected on the Wall's ancient stones.
   The government placed a special emphasis on the Jerusalem Day
celebrations in an apparent attempt to confront Arab demands that
the status of Jerusalem, which Israel has declared its capital, be
discussed in talks on the future of the occupied lands. The
Palestine Liberation Organization has declared an independent state.
   At the Western Wall, Shamir vowed that that ``the country of the
murderers will not come into being.''
   ``No force in the world can separate us and Jerusalem,'' Shamir
declared at a rally earlier in the day.
   Also Thursday, Jewish extremists waving Israeli flags and
singing Hebrew songs marched for two hours through Jerusalem's Arab
sector under heavy police guard to mark Jerusalem Day.
   Police fired tear gas and chased an Arab youth into his home
after a bottle and two rocks were dropped from rooftops on a group
of about 50 Jewish marchers. No one was injured.
   Ariel, a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, amended rules
requiring Palestinian employees to wear tags reading ``alien
worker.'' Dorit Shalit, an administrative employee, said all
non-residents would be required to wear tags, including Jews.
   Introduction of the tags for Palestinians had inspired
comparisons with the Nazi order that every Jew wear a yellow Star
of David.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher called
the tags for Palestinian workers ``offensive.''
   Also Thursday, at least 18 Palestinians, mostly teen-agers, were
wounded in clashes with troops in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Arab hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed eight injuries, including five people shot
and wounded in the West Bank city of Nablus. Arab reports said the
Nablus injuries occurred when soldiers opened fire to break up a
protest march by about 200 children.
   In the West Bank town of Salfit, Israeli paratroopers detained
about 30 suspected leaders of the uprising in a raid.

   A fifth-grader thinks children are ignored when
it comes to national holidays. So, with the help of his
congressman, he's trying to institute National Kids' Day.
   ``Most kids are good citizens,'' said Larry Banister II, a
10-year-old from Dahlonega in northern Georgia. ``I tell people
kids are our most precious asset. They honor mothers and fathers
and old folks, so why not kids too?''
   Since he was in the third grade, Larry has been lobbying
Washington, as well as city, county and state governments across
the country, to institute a holiday honoring children.
   He said his campaign began when he observed an ``old folks'' day
at his school and he was ``inspired by a bit of envy.''
   Larry's mother, Joyce Banister, put it this way: ``You know how
on Mother's Day you buy a little gift and think about the person?
Well, that's what kids want too.''
   The youngster's efforts haven't gone unnoticed. In all, more
than 25 local governments have passed resolutions observing a
children's day, Larry said, including his home county, Lumpkin
County.
   Last week, Larry received a letter informing him that Juneau,
Alaska, would honor kids this Friday. Mayor Bruce Botelho
proclaimed June 2 as Youth Appreciation Day in the Alaskan capital,
noting that it was also the last day of the school year there.
   Though Larry's letter to Botelho didn't mention it, the date
also happens to be the boy's birthday.
   But Georgia so far is the only state government to honor
children. Gov. Joe Frank Harris instituted Kids' Day last Dec. 8.
   Larry hopes that with the help of Rep. Ed Jenkins, the nation
will soon observe a Kids' Day, too.
   Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy III, D-Mass., offered a resolution Feb.
7, naming the second Sunday in October 1989 as National Children's
Day. A spokesman in Kennedy's office said the resolution, offered
at the behest of Kennedy's twin sons, passed the House on a voice
vote May 9 and went to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Jenkins, a Democrat from Jasper, said when Larry first
approached him two years ago, he decided to co-sponsor the
resolution that passed.
   But it didn't fully suit Larry, Jenkins said, because the day
was not permanently observed and was not a national holiday. The
congressman noted that a weekday holiday, with time off for
government workers, would cost taxpayers ``hundreds of millions of
dollars.''
   ``We try to be careful in not proliferating holidays,'' he said.
``But I think little Larry will be happy with a permanent
resolution to observe the day, or maybe a holiday on the weekend.''
   ``If he keeps pushing, he may very well succeed in setting aside
the same day to be observed every year,'' Jenkins said. ``He's a
bright young man and he already has me in his pocket.''
   Jenkins said Larry is ``a little upset'' with President Bush
because he has not answered letters on the subject. Larry _ who
says he plans to run for president himself one day _ contends that,
if Bush were interested, there would be a Kids' Day for sure.
   ``Finally I wrote him and asked if he had a gap in his gourd,
and that time a secretary wrote back to tell me the president can't
respond to every letter,'' said Larry. ``It'd only take one minute
to write me.''

<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa said
Thursday he will ask India to withdraw its troops next month, two
years after they arrived to disarm Tamil guerrillas under an
agreement to end the ethnic civil war.
   ``I would like to see the last of the Indian troops leave Sri
Lanka by the end of July,'' he told a Buddhist gathering at a
temple in Battaramula, seven miles southeast of Colombo.
   The first Indian soldiers arrived July 30, 1987, hours after
Premadasa's predecessor, Junius R. Jayewardene, and Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi signed the peace accord.
   Its purpose was to end years of rebellion by Tamils seeking an
independent homeland. The war began in 1982 and has claimed 9,000
lives.
   India became involved because it is the major power in the
region and has a Tamil population of about 60 million.
   The number of Indian soldiers grew from the initial 3,000 to
70,000 as confrontations increased with Tamil militants who did not
accept the peace agreement. An estimated 45,000 Indian soldiers
remain in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, where most Tamils live.
   More than 700 Indian soldiers have been killed.
   ``India's action to call back the peacekeeping force during the
next two months will be considered as a favor,'' Premadasa said.
``I have no doubt that India will do so.''
   Since assuming office five months ago, Premadasa has repeatedly
said he wants Indian soldiers to withdraw, but had not set a
timetable.
   Referring to a summit of seven South Asian nations scheduled for
Colombo later this year, Premadasa said Sri Lanka cannot host such
a meeting ``when a foreign army is operating in the country.''
   He said Sri Lanka was grateful for the sacrifices made by India,
but ``we will be also grateful if India agrees to withdraw its
troops from the country.''
   From the outset of its involvement, India has said it had no
plans to remain in Sri Lanka indefinitely.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up about 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and claim discrimination by the
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese majority. Premadasa is Sinhalese,
as was Jayewardene.
   The most powerful rebel group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, backed out of the peace agreement and continued the
guerrilla war. Premadasa opened negotiations with the Tigers after
offering them amnesty and seats in Parliament.
   Sinhalese radicals oppose overtures to the Tamils and embarked
on their own campaign of violence soon after the peace accord was
signed.
   Police said Sinhalese militants killed six people Thursday in
three separate attacks. Among the victims were Bennet Perera, chief
of a special police unit investigating Sinhalese radicals, and his
chauffeur.

   President Bush has selected Shirley Temple Black,
America's best-know child actor in the 1930s and 1940s, as the new
ambassador to Czechoslovakia, the White House said Thursday.
   Ms. Black, 61, has held a number of government posts since her
Hollywood days. She was ambassador to Ghana from 1974 to 1976.
   She also served as White House chief of protocol in 1976-77 and
as special representative to the United Nations in 1969-70.
   The nomination, which will require Senate confirmation, was
announced here during a two-night stop by Bush on a European tour.
   In other personnel action, Bush said he will nominate:
   _Timothy B. Atkeson to be assistant administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency for international activities. He
currently is a partner in a Washington law firm.
   _C. Howard Wilkins to be ambassador to the Netherlands. Wilkins
is the founder of a development corporation and head of a
restaurant corporation.
   _Morris D. Busby to be accorded rank of ambassador during his
service as the administration's coordinator for counter terrorism.
Busby has been roving ambassador and special envoy for Central
America since 1987.
   Bush also announced that Michael Ussery will remain as
ambassador to Morocco and Richard W. Boehm will remain as
ambassador to Oman.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Ohio Republican Party
on Thursday asked for the resignation of U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens,
who was convicted last week of a misdemeanor charge of having sex
with a 16-year-old girl.
   ``I think he is a bad apple for the Republican Party,'' Robert
Bennett said at a news conference. ``I do not expect Congressman
Lukens to be on the ticket anytime in 1990.''
   Bennett said the four-term Republican congressman from
Middletown also should resign from the Republican State Committee,
which oversees the party's operations in Ohio.
   The call for Lukens' resignation was ``the obvious political
move,'' said Lukens' chief of staff, William Jarrell.
   ``This is a ... move where the party distances itself from
Lukens. They have their own pressures they have to react to,''
Jarrell said by telephone from Washington.
   But Jarrell said Lukens ``feels no bitterness whatsoever to Mr.
Bennett or the Republican Party.''
   Lukens, 58, was convicted May 26 of contributing to the
delinquency and unruliness of a minor following a five-day trial in
Franklin County Domestic Relations Court. A jury found Lukens
guilty of having sex with the girl at his Columbus apartment last
Nov. 6 when she was 16.
   A misdemeanor conviction does not prohibit a congressman from
remaining in office or seeking re-election.
   Bennett said he talked with Lukens late Wednesday and informed
the congressman's office Thursday of his plan to seek the
resignation. Bennett said he also conferred with party leaders in
Lukens' western Ohio district.
   Lukens planned to make a statement Friday on his political
future, said Jarrell. Lukens, who plans to appeal the conviction,
is confident he will win back party support, Jarrell said.
   ``After we file and win the appeal, they're going to be right
back in his corner,'' said Jarrell.
   Lukens served two terms in Congress in the late 1960s and was
re-elected in 1986.
   Bennett said he will meet with the party leaders after Lukens is
sentenced. Sentencing is expected during the week of June 26. Judge
Ronald Solove has ordered a presentence investigation.

<HEAD>Man Who Disconnected Son's Life-Support Taken to Hospital for Drug
Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CICERO, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who sparked a national debate when he
disconnected his comatose son's life-support system at gunpoint was
taken to a hospital Thursday for a violent reaction to an illegal
drug, police said.
   Rudy Linares, a 23-year-old house painter, was discharged later
in the day after a medical evaluation, said Mac Neal Memorial
Hospital spokeswoman Diane Laux.
   Officers were dispatched to the Linares' home early Thursday
after paramedics requested help, said Cicero Deputy Police
Superintendent Steve Zalas.
   Detective Ronald Mersch described Linares as ``wild, like an
epileptic would be.''
   ``Mr. Linares told one of the officers he'd taken some bad
PCP,'' Zalas said. PCP is the hallucinogen phencyclidine, known on
the street as angel dust, a drug with both stimulating and
depressing effects.
   Zalas said Linares told officers, ``What would you do if your
son just died?''
   ``He was kind of combative,'' Zalas said. ``... There was a
confrontation and he had to be handcuffed before we could put him
on a stretcher.''
   Zalas said officers did not find any drugs in the apartment.
   In April, Linares was charged with murder after he pulled a
handgun in a hospital where his 15-month-old son was being kept,
ordered staff from the room, and then unhooked the life-support
system.
   He cradled his son, Samuel, in his arms about 30 minutes until
he was certain the boy was dead.
   Prosecutors decided they would not pursue the murder charge
after a Cook County grand jury refused to indict Linares on May 19.
   The boy had been in a coma, considered irreversible by doctors,
since choking on a balloon nine months earlier. The hospital,
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, had refused family
requests to withdraw life support, saying the child was not brain
dead.
   Linares and his wife have two other children.
   Neighbors said the latest incident caught them by surprise.
   ``It might have been eating him up on the inside, but he didn't
show it on the outside,'' said Kevin Camarena.
   ``All his bereavement was built up inside because he was so
composed,'' said another neighbor, Bernice Kield. ``It was just
bottled up and it exploded.''

<HEAD>Bush Approves Funds for Landsat Satellites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush announced Thursday he had approved
funding for continued operations of two existing Landsat satellites
and for the completion and launch of a third satellite that takes
close-range pictures of Earth.
   The announcement was made by the traveling White House while
Bush was at dinner with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on
the final evening of his four-country trip to Europe.
   The president's action saves the satellites from extinction.
They had been turned over to private industry in 1985, but the
company formed to sell the images was unable to make the venture
pay even with government help.
   Spot, a French satellite, is capable of taking even better
images than Landsat and has captured much of the market for remote
sensing.
   The Commerce Department announced earlier this year that it had
no funds to continue operating the satellite and planned to shut it
down. Vice President Dan Quayle, head of the National Space
Council, stepped in and urged the president to find money to give
the satellites a new lease on life.
   The White House announcement said continued operation of
Landsats 4 and 5 will require an additional $5 million this fiscal
year and $19 million next year. Cost of completion and launch of
Landsat 6 by 1991 has already been included in the Commerce
Department budget.
   ``Over recent years it has become increasingly evident that
commercializing the entire Landsat program would not be feasible
until at least the end of the century,'' the statement said.
   Landsat images have been used since 1972 to evaluate Earth
resources and soil moisture and search for oil and other minerals.

<TEXT>
   Police have made one arrest and
are seeking other participants and about 10 bystanders in a gang
rape at the beach of this Florida Panhandle resort town,
authorities said Thursday.
   A 17-year-old vacationer from Tennessee returned Tuesday to the
beach where she reported being raped a day earlier and identified
one of four attackers, Police Chief Lee Sullivan said.
   Gregory Shane Hardin, 18, of Boaz, Ala., was arrested on a
sexual battery charge, Sullivan said. Hardin was in jail Thursday
under $50,000 bond on the felony, which is Florida's equivalent of
a rape charge.
   The chief called the attack the most pitiful sexual crime he has
seen during his years of law enforcement.
   ``It should never have happened,'' he said. ``It's not going to
happen again. We made some patrol procedure changes and moved some
of our resources to the beach.''
   Sullivan said rape is rare in the community, but a gang rape in
front of witnesses is a ``sad commentary on us all.''
   Hardin and possibly one other man allegedly raped the teen-ager
while two others helped hold her down, Sullivan said. The victim
was bruised on her ankles, wrists, breasts and genitals.
   ``The lab is going to be able to tell us how many assaults we
had,'' he said.
   The young woman was vacationing with her mother and a friend to
celebrate her high school graduation. While her friend left for
something to eat, she joined an impromptu party near the beachfront
Holiday Inn, where she met Hardin and another man, said police Lt.
Howard Parks.
   At about 2 a.m., each man allegedly took her by an arm and
forced her to go with them to a nearby sailboat rental business.
She was raped on one of the boats while the bystanders watched,
Parks said.

<TEXT>
   A blast of 2,440 tons of
ammonium nitrate and fuel oil rocked the White Sands Missile Range
Thursday in a simulation of the effects of a nuclear explosion.
   The test, called Miser's Gold, was the fifth in a series of
non-nuclear explosions set off since 1976 by the Defense Nuclear
Agency. It is intended to show what happens to military and
civilian equipment during and after a large explosion.
   The blast was the equivalent of a 4-kiloton nuclear device. By
comparison, the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima, Japan, in
August 1945 had a force of 13 kilotons.
   Miser's Gold includes 180 experiments by the United States and
five foreign countries intended to test the effects of air blast
and ground shock on such things as bunkers, underground shelters
and radar.
   Navy Cmdr. J.R. Lund of the agency's Test Directorate called the
test an unqualified success.
   However, he said it will take several months to evaluate what
was learned from all the experiments set up on the 120-acre test
bed.
   Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom
mostly tested civilian equipment, while the United States
concentrated on military systems, Lund said.
   ``The foreign countries are really into testing civil defense
shelters,'' he said.
   ``I think they feel they are more at risk,'' he added.
   About 125 people gathered in the southern New Mexico desert to
witness the blast, which was delayed 30 minutes before being
detonated at 9:30 a.m.
   At T minus one minute, onlookers who sat six miles north of
ground zero readied themselves and most inserted earplugs to deaden
the anticipated blast.
   A huge cloud of brown smoke formed a distorted mushroom against
the background of the blue sky and mountains. About 25 seconds
later, the shock wave could be felt by the spectators on the
bleachers while at the same moment a loud muffled boom rocked the
area.
   The boom was followed by cheers from the crowd.
   ``This is fun to look at, but the real work begins now,'' said
Lt. Col. Al Schenker of the Defense Nuclear Agency.
   Seven missiles were launched within one minute of the detonation
and flew through the brown cloud. The missiles will be tested for
erosion.
   Schenker said the test bed, including bunkers, rooms and other
structures, cost $2.65 million and took 14 months to build.

<HEAD>Gingrich Says Wright Insulted `Every Decent Person in the House'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright's chief accuser
charged Thursday that Wright's condemnation of ethics
investigations as ``mindless cannibalism'' in his resignation
speech was ``an insult to the ethics committee and every decent
person in the House.''
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican who was elected GOP
whip in large part because of his attacks on Wright, said he
initially refused to comment after Wright's resignation speech
Wednesday because ``I was so angry at the tone of the speech and
some of the things he said.''
   ``I thought the whole thing was designed to blame the
institution and to blame the press,'' Gingrich said of Wright's
speech.
   Gingrich said there is no ``feeding frenzy'' on ethics in the
House, as Wright alleged. Instead, he said, there is only an effort
to ensure that House standards are upheld.
   ``Why is it wrong to insist that the current rules be enforced
against gross violations?'' he said. ``Not against nitpicking, or
clerical error.''
   He said Wright and Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., who
announced Friday he was resigning rather than face an ethics probe
of his personal finances, are ``the first two guys I know of to
have resigned from high office for corruption in modern times.''
   House Democrats filed an ethics complaint against Gingrich in
April, alleging that he violated House rules when a group of
wealthy political supporters formed a partnership in 1984 to
promote his book, ``Window of Opportunity.''
   That complaint is still pending before the committee, and
Gingrich acknowledged Thursday that he might be the next target of
a House ethics investigation.
   ``I'm counting on the same ethics committee,'' he said. ``I
trust their judgment to be honest. They'll have a good measurement
_ they can take my book case, and they can compare it to Jim
Wright's book case.
   ``They're totally different ... Where Jim Wright was the example
of how to do it wrong, I think we're the example of how to do it
right,'' he said.
   Part of the ethics committee's case against Wright involved
allegations that he used bulk sales of his book, ``Reflections of a
Public Man,'' to evade the House limit on outside income.
   Gingrich said he does not believe the investigation of Wright
and the allegations of ethical wrongdoing by other members has
distracted the House from its real business.
   ``If you have a speaker with enough violations that he has to
resign, I think that's important,'' he said. ``...Isn't having an
honest House part of the real business of the House?''
   Asked if Republicans are planning to take advantage of
Democratic ethics problems for political ends, Gingrich said both
parties should be ``aggressive in looking for instances of bad
behavior and police each other.''

   Robert Fulton, opposed by a group of Senate
conservatives and right-to-life advocates, dropped out of
consideration Thursday for a top welfare post in the Bush
administration.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan, who had
wanted Fulton to head the Family Services Administration which
manages the government's major welfare programs, said he accepted
Fulton's decision with ``profound regret.''
   ``I have requested my name be withdrawn, but, of course, I don't
do that with any joy,'' Fulton, Oklahoma's social services
secretary, told The Associated Press.
   In a statement issued by his office, Sullivan said Fulton would
have ``done an outstanding job'' as an assistant secretary in the
federal department.
   Sullivan said he would continue to review other candidates for
the position and would make a recommendation to President Bush ``as
quickly as possible.''
   Fulton was opposed by some right-to-life groups who criticized
his action when, as director of the Oklahoma human services
department, he became aware of a state hospital policy of
withholding life-saving care from babies with the crippling
deformity spina bifida.
   Trying to fend off the criticism, Fulton had said that after
learning of the policy, he put into effect regulations requiring
medical treatment for all infants unless it would be futile or
would shorten the baby's life.
   But critics said protections he instituted were required by
federal law and they said doctors involved were never sanctioned.
   ``He took only the most superficial investigation, did not speak
to any of the doctors and did not hold anyone accountable,'' said
Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who last month sent Bush a letter
signed by five other conservative senators opposing Fulton.
   ``I am relieved that the nomination will not be made,'' said
Humphrey.
   ``He demonstrated an insensitivity to the right to life of
handicapped infants,'' said Douglas Johnson, legislative director
for the National Right-to-Life Committee.
   ``We felt it was inappropriate to put someone like that in a
senior policy position of a pro-life administration,'' added
Johnson in a telephone interview.
   ``The most disturbing thing about it is the influence of the
special interest groups'' on the administration, Fulton said
concerning his withdrawal.

   President Bush sought to ease strains with Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thursday and maintain a special
relationship with her conservative government as he wrapped up his
four-nation European tour.
   While Bush mended fences after a tough session with Mrs.
Thatcher, Secretary of State James A. Baker III challenged the
Soviet Union to resond to the latest U.S. proposal for cutting
American and Soviet troops in Europe to 275,000 on each side.
   Brushing aside a cool reaction from Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze as only preliminary, Baker said ``the ball is in their
court and a response by them is now clearly called for.''
   He said Western experts will meet for three months at NATO
headquarters in Brussels to flesh out Bush's arms-reduction
initiatives, which include the projected troop cuts, so they can be
formally presented by the Western alliance to the Warsaw Pact in
Vienna on Sept. 7.
   Bush, who will fly home on Friday, lunched with Queen Elizabeth
II on duck with honey and brandy sauce in the chandeliered second
floor Music Room of Buckingham Palace after meeting with Mrs.
Thatcher.
   ``It's only with friends that you can take off the gloves and
talk from the heart,'' Bush told reporters at the conclusion of his
session with the prime minister at heavily guarded 10 Downing
Street. ``And I felt that I was with a friend today.''
   As the day wore on, the two leaders put the emphasis on the
centuries' old ties that bind their nations.
   At a gala dinner at 10 Downing Street where both Thatcher and
Bush regaled the guests with jokes and anecdotes, each spoke
seriously of what the Anglo-American relationship means.
   ``You always will be able to count on Britain when there is
danger, when you need us. That's why the relationship is so
special,'' Thatcher told Bush.
   He called Mrs. Thatcher a seasoned leader and said Americans
look to the prime minister ``with great admiration for all you have
done for Britain and all you have done for the alliance.''
   He said that with NATO's new arms control initiative, ``we seek
to free Western Europe from the shadow of Soviet military power.''
   The special relationship forged under former President Reagan
was tested a bit at the NATO summit meeting this week in Brussels
over how the Western allies should respond to arms control
initiatives by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Led by Bush, the 16 allied leaders forged a compromise that
blended Mrs. Thatcher's hard-line views with the more dovish
position of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   That problem resolved, Baker acknowledged at a news conference a
continuing U.S.-British disagremement over South Asian ``boat
people.''
   About 750 are arriving daily in Hong Kong and the Thatcher
government would like to stem the flow and send some back to
Vietnam and Cambodia.
   Baker said, however, ``it is still the position of the United
States that we support the right of political asylum and freedom of
choice'' for political refugees.
   There are strains also over continued U.S. military aid to
Argentina, Britain's adversary in the 1982 Falkland Islands war.
   With the return to power in Buenos Aires of the nationalistic
Peronists, Britain is even more touchy about Argentina's claim to
own the British-controlled islands off the South American coast.
   Bush and Thatcher stressed agreements rather than differences in
remarks after the meeting, with the prime minister praising Bush's
leadership at the ``very, very successful'' NATO summit meeting.
   She said the president ``is staunch and steadfast on everything
which is of fundamental value to democracy, freedom and justice,
and necessary to keep our country secure.''
   Asked if Britain remains America's most important ally, Mrs.
Thatcher replied: ``I think you might put it more tactfully.
America has allies throughout Europe and throughout the free world.
   ``I would like to think that we pride ourselves on being among
the foremost of United States' friends, and we will always be.
   ``I think it is quite wrong, that because you have one friend,
you should exclude the possibility of other friendships as well.''
   Bush, asked about the special relationship, said he expects it
to stay on a ``steady keel.''
   However, in a toast to Mrs. Thatcher at dinner at 10 Downing
Street, he said every time he meets her he is reminded of the late
Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's observation that ``There is no
wisdom like frankness.''
   In diplomatic jargon, ``frankness'' signifies disagreement.
   The 64 guests at the Downing Street dinner were an eclectic mix
of Cabinet ministers, aristocrats, trade unionists, former Prime
Minister Alec Douglas-Home, now Lord Home, and Neil Kinnock, leader
of the opposition Labor Party.
   Other British celebrities on the guest list were comedian John
Cleese, star of the movie ``A Fish Called Wanda;'' Andrew Lloyd
Webber, composer of such hit musicals as ``Cats'' and ``Phantom of
the Opera;'' U.S. Masters golf champion Nick Faldo; former
Wimbledon tennis champion Virginia Wade, and television host David
Frost.
   Bush's two-day visit to London has not delighted all residents
of the city, nor suburbanites who tried to get to their jobs in the
midst of a subway strike.
   Already clogged streets were blocked for the Bush motorcade as
it sped from event to event, guided by motorcyle police who cleared
a path for the president.

   Maoist guerrillas killed Peru's leading writer
on the environment along with a government agronomist Thursday, and
pro-Cuban rebels killed 10 men as drug addicts in a jungle town,
officials said.
   Journalist Barbara D'Achille and agronomist Esteban Bohorquez
were killed after Shining Path guerrillas stopped their
government-owned pickup truck on a mountain road in the highlands
150 miles southeast of Lima, reported El Comercio, the newspaper
for which she worked.
   The government meanwhile expanded the area under military
control Thursday to include all of Ucayali state and part of Loreto
state in the eastern jungle. Nine of Peru's 24 states now are under
states of emergency that give control to the military as part of
the counterinsurgency effort.
   Ms. D'Achille, 45, and Bohorquez, who worked for a state
development corporation, were shot near Huancavelica. The gunmen
spared the driver and another passenger but blew up the truck,
according to the report.
   A senior editor at the newspaper, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the writer was traveling in the region to gather
information for a story on alpacas, llamas and vicunas _ highland
pack animals used for their wool.
   Ms. D'Achille, a naturalized Peruvian born in the Soviet Union,
had worked for the newspaper five years and was recognized as
Peru's leading writer on this country's ecology and environment.
   At least 15 journalists have been assassinated since Peru's
leftist insurgency began in 1980. More than 14,000 people in all
have been killed.
   On Wednesday, 10 young men were killed before dawn in Tarapoto,
a jungle town of 35,000 people about 450 miles north of Lima at the
edge of the country's coca-growing region.
   The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement distributed leaflets in
Tarapoto two weeks earlier announcing its intention to ``clean up''
the town, the largest in San Martin state. The leaflets warned
prostitutes, thieves, drug addicts and homosexuals they had 15 days
to leave town or be killed.
   The 15-day period lapsed Tuesday.
   Eight victims were found together near the city cemetery, each
shot in the head, a city official told the AP in a telephone
interview. He said a police patrol found the other two in the same
area later in the day. The official spoke on condition of not being
identified, citing security reasons.
   The 10 young men were said to have attended a party together
Tuesday night.
   The Tupac Amaru band is a pro-Cuba group that surfaced in 1984
and operates separately from the Shining Path and in competition
with it.
   The pro-Cuban guerrillas usually engaged in urban sabotage
against property and rarely killed civilians. The group began as an
urban guerrilla organization, but in the last two years expanded
into rural areas.
   Estimates of the organization's size range from 500 to 1,500.
   In late April, a military patrol wiped out a column of 68 Tupac
Amaru guerrillas near the highland town of Jauja.

   A couple who claimed their infant son
was the victim of product tampering have been charged with murder,
accused of forcing the child to drink baby formula laced with acid,
prosecutors said Thursday.
   ``It's a case that's been on my mind for five years,'' said
Matthew Chancey, assistant Lake County state's attorney.
   Shelia Smith, 26, and Ricky Irby Sr., 29, were each charged in a
grand jury indictment with a single count of murder and put in jail
in lieu of $1 million bonds ordered Thursday by Lake County
Associate Judge Harry Hartel.
   On May 31, 1984, the parents were charged with abuse in a
juvenile petition after bringing their 3-month-old son, Quinten
Irby, to a hospital and claiming he had been poisoned by drinking
baby formula, Chancey said.
   Tests on the boy's stomach found high concentrations of a
substance believed to be pure sulfuric acid. But much of the
evidence gathered during the original investigation _ cans of
formula, a baby bottle and a nipple _ was lost at the Illinois
Department of Public Health laboratory, where it was sent for
analysis.
   Chancey said prosecutors decided not to pursue the case after
the loss of the evidence.
   Quintin, meanwhile, lingered near death for more than two years
with severe burn scars on his mouth and trachea. He also had one
lung removed and was kept on a ventilator until his August 1986
death at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago.
   ``He was unable to swallow, to breathe or to speak,'' Chancey
recalled.
   ``The nature of the crime ... the setback after we lost much of
the evidence, the frustration for a long time that we wouldn't be
able to indict anyone. I carried all those things around for a long
time,'' he said.
   A break for prosecutors came in November when the U.S. Supreme
Court, in an Arizona case, ruled that evidence lost accidentally
does not prevent prosecution.
   ``Immediately after that this case popped into my mind,''
Chancey said. ``I started thinking, `Maybe we can do this.'''
   Chancey said that prior to a trial of the case he would not
discuss whether he believes money was the motive for the poisoning.
   Irby filed a lawsuit in August 1987, charging negligence against
the baby formula maker, Abbott Laboratories of North Chicago, and
the grocery store where he said the formula was bought.
   The lawsuit claimed the Similac with Iron formula the couple
gave to Quinten contained a ``foreign and dangerous acidic and-or
lye substance'' and was ``unfit for human consumption.''
   Irby withdrew the lawsuit a year ago.
   ``We're not sure why that was,'' Abbott spokeswoman Cathy
Babington said Thursday. ``As I recall, there were never any
pleadings in the case when it was withdrawn.''
   A county grand jury heard evidence for four weeks before
returning the indictment Wednesday.
   Chancey said the parents have an 8-year-old son, Ricky Jr. He
said both are unemployed, although Irby has worked at area
automobile plants.
   Neither Ms. Smith nor Irby was represented by an attorney,
though Irby has retained one and Ms. Smith told Hartel she would
have one by Wednesday's scheduled arraignment.

   Rep. Richard Gephardt appealed to Democratic
colleagues Thursday to elect him majority leader as part of a ``new
generation'' to take control of the House.
   ``John Kennedy said in 1961 that it was time for a new
generation of Americans to lead our country. Now I believe it is
time for a new generation of members to lead the Congress,''
Gephardt, 48, said in a letter to House Democrats.
   The Missouri congressman noted that, like himself, two-thirds of
current House members have been elected since 1978, and he
described the Democrats as a ``young and vibrant majority.''
   The seven-term lawmaker is campaigning for the No. 2 House
leadership spot to replace Rep. Tom Foley, who is expected to
become speaker next week now that Speaker Jim Wright has announced
his resignation.
   Gephardt, who ran for president in 1988, is considered the
front-runner in the leadership race although he is opposed by Rep.
Ed Jenkins, D-Ga.
   In an interview, Gephardt said he was ``encouraged'' by support
he had already received from Democrats but would not predict
victory.
   ``The feedback has been positive, but I'm surely not prepared to
say that we've done it,'' said Gephardt.
   He made clear that his candidacy, in contrast to Jenkins', was
based on the generational appeal to Democrats as well his
experiences as a television-age presidential candidate and in
previous leadership posts in the House, including four years as
party caucus chairman.
   ``I think I learned how to put together coalitions in the House
so we can reach consensus in the Congress and be able to assert a
policy,'' said Gephardt. ``I also have learned something about
conveying an issue to voters in the country at large.''
   The Missourian confirmed in the letter that he would not seek
the 1992 presidential nomination if he becomes majority leader but
would ``devote all of my energies to the work of the House.'' He
said he had been ``seriously considering'' another run for the
White House, and said it was a difficult decision to seek the House
post.
   Some Democrats were annoyed at Gephardt's prolonged absence from
the House during last year's presidential campaign, when he was
head of the party caucus, the No. 4 leadership job. He no longer
holds that post.
   ``I am not going to use a House leadership position as a
stepping stone to something else,'' Gephardt said. ``I haven't said
this about '92 because I thought it was necessary to get elected
but because I believe that you can't do two things at once of this
magnitude.''
   In his letter, Gephardt echoed Wright's call for an end to
partisan bloodletting over ethics and said lawmakers must ``get
back to the peoples' business.''
   ``There are too many urgent needs facing our nation for us to
engage in retribution and unnecessary partisanship,'' Gephardt
wrote.
   ``It will be my goal, working with Tom Foley and with each of
you, to help shape and implement a legislative agenda that
addresses the nation's most serious concerns.''
   He cited health care, housing, education and ``economic
security'' as pressing topics before Congress.
   Gephardt said he was ``not interested in wallowing in rumor or
engaging in partisan intrigue.''
   His supporters view his as ``squeaky clean,'' certified by a
presidential campaign as free of any potential ethical problems to
cause the party further embarrassment.
   Gephardt jumped into the leadership race on Saturday after Rep.
Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the majority whip, announced his resignation
from the House in order to avoid a lengthy investigation into his
own personal finances.

   Cardinal John O'Connor said he canceled his trip
to Moslem West Beirut during a three-day visit to Lebanon because
he was told he was on a hit list, according to a televised
interview.
   First on the list was Sheik Hassan Khaled, spiritual leader of
Lebanon's Sunni Moslems, who was killed May 17 by a car bomb,
O'Connor told WNBC-TV news in an interview broadcast Thursday.
   ``It was purported that he was to be the first of five on a hit
list and then the assumption was that I might well be No. 2,''
O'Connor said.
   The last visitors Khaled received before his death were people
who came to arrange a meeting between O'Connor and Khaled, the
cardinal said in the interview.
   Asked if he courts martyrdom, O'Connor laughed and said:
``Listen, I try to stay alive even in New York. I'm not a hero, no,
there's nothing heroic at all about me. I'm your basic coward.''
   During his 27 years as a chaplain in the Navy and Marines, the
cardinal spent some time in combat zones in Vietnam.
   O'Connor spent Saturday, Sunday and Monday in Lebanon and
returned to New York Wednesday.
   He had described his visit as an evenhanded attempt to bring
attention to the sufferings by Christians and Moslems in Lebanon,
but Moslems criticized the cancellation of his visit to Moslem West
Beirut.
   The cardinal made the trip despite U.S. State Department
warnings to stay away from the war-torn country.

   More than 1,000 helmeted soldiers jogged near a
city train station Friday in the third straight day of
muscle-flexing aimed at unnerving pro-democracy protesters holed up
in Tiananmen Square.
   The People's Liberation Army troops came out of the station, ran
through the surrounding neighborhood and returned to their camp in
the station. But they did not approach Tiananmen Square just over a
mile away.
   The square, the symbolic heart of China, has been occupied by up
to 200,000 students since they launched their protests more than
six weeks ago. About 10,000 students are massed there now in
defiance of martial law orders to leave.
   The students, who have gained considerable support from ordinary
citizens, are demanding more democracy, an end to corruption among
officials, and a dialogue with the government.
   Instead, the government has engaged them in a war of nerves, and
this week's shows of force indicated that officials are poised to
enforce martial law and put down the protest movement.
   On Thursday, about 300 army troops marched within a block of
Tiananmen Square on Thursday. National television showed hundreds
of soldiers fast-stepping out of the city railroad station.
   The previous day, a large procession of military motorcycles
roared through the capital.
   Beijing citizens, in a show of support for the students, blocked
troops from entering the city after the government declared martial
law on May 20.
   But residents for the moment are subdued as the government wages
a propaganda campaign warns that participants in pro-democracy
rallies face pay cuts and other punishment.
   A city spokesman issued a stern warning Thursday to foreign
journalists, saying they were banned from covering student protests
and that all media coverage in the capital must receive prior
approval by city officials.
   Ding Weijun also said foreign journalists are not allowed to
invite Chinese citizens to their offices, residences or hotels
``for interviews on activities prohibited'' under martial law.
   The Foreign Correspondents Club of China said the regulations
were a ``deplorable case of press censorship and harassment'' and
urged the Beijing government to rescind the restrictions.
   Ding's seven-point statement, read at a weekly Foreign Ministry
briefing, expanded on martial law regulations banning foreign press
coverage of the student protests. The restrictions include a ban on
photographing or videotaping military troops.
   Beijing-based foreign journalists and hundreds more who have
come to cover the protests had faced few problems until this week,
when police warned at least two U.S. television networks and a
Japanese network that their crews were violating martial law
regulations.
   Police also summoned a correspondent for the Japanese daily
Yomiuri Shimbun for a warning, and on Thursday the British
Broadcasting Corp. was called in.
   Late Thursday night, a few hundred students protested in front
of police headquarters, claiming that officers had beaten a
Japanese reporter and two students.
   The confrontation between the students and authorities took a
strange twist on Thursday when hundreds of students disrupted a
pro-government rally in a village north of Beijing.
   Thousands of farmers and workers, many ordered by local
officials or employers to attend the rally, were silenced when
their slogans of support for Premier Li Peng's hard-line policies
were drowned out by the students' shouts for Li's resignation.
   In another propaganda face-off, the students entertained
thousands of children on Tiananmen Square to offset government
charges they had disrupted Children's Day celebrations planned for
the plaza, which the students took over on May 13.
   Children brought popsicles, stuffed animals and money for the
students, who signed autographs with such messages as, ``When you
go to college, may you never have to endure the hardship of a
hunger strike.''
   Also on Thursday, student activists announced the creation of a
nationwide student group intended to end a rift between Beijing
students and others from outside the city.
   The students have grown increasingly divided over whether to
remain on the square and how to keep their faltering movement alive.
   Some student leaders claimed that four members of the
non-Beijing faction entered the tent of Beijing activist Chai Ling
early Thursday and tried to gag and kidnap her. They said the
anti-Beijing faction cut loudspeaker wires when Chai later tried to
tell others on the square about the incident.

   Two members of the ruling Communist Party
Politburo made clear Thursday they reject populist Boris N.
Yeltsin's demand to relinquish supreme power.
   Vadim A. Medvedev, chief party ideologist, and Moscow Communist
Party boss Lev N. Zaikov told reporters the party has the right to
choose the head of state and government.
   ``As in any civilized state, the leader of the party becomes the
head of state. That's fully natural,'' Medvedev said.
   The officials spoke after members of the Congress of People's
Deputies openly questioned whether President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
should serve in the dual role of head of party and state, and after
Yelstin's sharp criticism of the party on Wednesday.
   Yeltsin, who was replaced by Zaikov as Moscow party chief,
called for an immediate transfer of power from the Communist Party
to the Congress.
   ``The Congress must take power into its own hands,'' Yeltsin
said Wednesday. He charged that Gorbachev's policy of perestroika,
or restructuring, had failed and that people were living worse four
years after it was implemented.
   The party is identified in the Soviet Constitution as the
leading force in Soviet society, and no other parties are legal.
   About 80 percent of the 2,250 members of the Congress are
Communist Party members.But the Congress' slogans declare that
power rests with the soviets, or local governing councils, and
Yeltsin's demand recalled that still-powerful appeal from the first
days of the Bolshevik revolution.
   Neither Politburo official criticized Yeltsin directly.
   Medvedev said he was an ardent supporter of a sharper line
between party and government functions, with the party taking the
work of shaping policy, ideology, organization and political work,
and the government being responsible for legislation and executive
functions.
   Asked which job was more important, Communist Party chief or
president, he responded that the jobs simply had different
responsibilities.
   Zaikov said opposes removing the Communist Party's special
status in the Soviet Constitution, but held open the possibility
that competition might some day be allowed.
   Asked about the possibility of a multi-party system, he
responded: ``Who thought our socialist revolution would take place?
Who thought that perestroika would start? Who can say when it will
be, if it will be? Maybe.''
   But he added that now was not the time. The Communist Party ``is
at its most difficult, critical stage,'' and it would be unfair to
allow another party to spring up and ``practice pure politics,'' he
said.
   The party must concentrate on consolidating the strengths of
Soviet society rather than allowing it to break down in partisan
politics, Zaikov said.
   Yeltsin has been accused by party official of speaking out in
favor of a multi-party system. A commission of the party's
policy-making Central Committee is investigating the accusation.
   Yeltsin denies it, but says that the issue must be discussed
rather than repressed as it has been for decades.

<HEAD>Police Say Ax Attackers Wanted Human Sacrifice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three women accused of trying to kill a
26-year-old man by bashing his head with an ax were followers of
the supernatural and wanted to perform a human sacrifice,
authorities said.
   Deborah Kazuck, 26; Catherine Lipsham, 22; and Ramona Barry, 27,
were charged Wednesday with attempted murder in connection with the
attack Monday in Ms. Lipsham's and Ms. Barry's apartment. They were
each being held under $75,000 bail.
   The man suffered a severe gash to the forehead when hit with an
ax, but he managed to flee. The wound required 50 stitches. He was
being kept at an undisclosed location under a witness protection
program.
   Ms. Kazuck told authorities she had been the mother of Jack the
Ripper in a previous life, according to the criminal complaint. She
said that if she killed someone, she would prove her love to the
legendary 19th century British murderer in an attempt to get him to
return to this world, the complaint said.
   Alan Olshan, Ms. Kazuck's attorney, said, ```In my judgment, she
is mentally ill.''
   The women chanted ``redrum,'' or murder spelled backward, during
the attack, police said. ``Redrum'' was a term used in ``The
Shining,'' a book and movie about supernatural violence.
   Lt. Gary Marks said the women searched the city for six months
for someone to ``kack,'' the term they gave for ``kill,'' before
luring the man to the apartment.
   ``They all have been engaging in seances to communicate with
different spirits,'' he said. ``One of them said she has been
trying to bring Hitler back from the dead.''
   Marks said the man met the women about two weeks ago in a park
and occasionally visited with them.
   ``They were just friends,'' Marks said. ``He said they seemed
perfectly normal.''
   The criminal complaint said the man went to the home late Monday
after Ms. Barry telephoned and said she was frightened by a storm.
   When he went to use the bathroom, he heard a noise and pulled
back a shower curtain hanging over the bathtub, the complaint said.
Ms. Kazuck, who was in the bathtub with Ms. Lipsham, lifted an ax
over her head and struck him, the complaint said.
   The two women tried to grab the man as he fled, it said. Ms.
Barry remained outside the bathroom, hearing a crash and the man's
screams, the complaint said.
   ``They were saying, `Redrum, redrum, redrum' in a low voice,''
Marks said.
   ``He went for the door and had a hard time getting out, but he
made it. He kept running and never looked back,'' he said.
   Before the man arrived, the three women spoke about draining his
blood into the bathtub, cutting his body into pieces and eating his
kidneys, the complaint said.
   The women said ``kack'' is derived from Jack the Ripper's
nickname, with the ``j'' substituted with a ``k'' for ``kill.''

<HEAD>Suspended Subsidies to Resume</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Housing and Urban Development Department
said Thursday it will resume subsidies, under new rules, for the
rehabilitation of privately owned housing used by low-income and
moderate-income families.
   Secretary Jack Kemp had suspended the program in April,
canceling awards made this fiscal year, after the department's
inspector general reported it had been mismanaged and riddled with
favoritism for former high-ranking Republicans serving as
consultants to developers.
   The department's announcement said new awards will be based on
numerical rankings in a competitive process for available funds.
   ``I am fully committed to admistering a reformed Moderate
Rehabilitation Program in a fair, open, competitive manner _ with
no special favors, no insder's access and no secret deals,'' Kemp
said in a statement.
   The ranking formula will consider area poverty, crowding and
quality of housing for the poor; will eliminate reserve funds
allocated according to the discretion of headquarters and will
limit awards to projects of fewer than 100 units to discourage
participation by big developers.
   The department said it could have $250 million available for the
remainder of the fiscal year, depending upon congressional action.

<HEAD>City Losses Court Effort To Stop Pipeline Reconstruction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court on Thursday denied
a request by city officials to stop the reconstruction of a
gasoline pipeline through a neighborhood that was virtually
destroyed when it exploded last week.
   The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, citing
lack of jurisdiction, refused to grant a temporary restraining
order, said city attorney James Penman. A state judge made the same
declaration earlier this week.
   Calnev Pipe Line Co. wants to replace the line along the same
course it occupied when it exploded in flames May 25, killing two
residents and injuring 31. The same area was struck two weeks
earlier with a fatal runaway train wreck.
   City officials want to have the pipeline relocated on the other
side of train track and away from the devastated residential
neighborhood. A 35-foot- high levee separates the track and the
neighborhood, said Penman. The wall of dirt would provide some
protection in the event of a similar accident, he said.
   The petition sought a stay of federal Pipeline Safety Director
Richard Beam's order for reinstallation, pending a federal court
review.
   While city officials try to find a way to halt the line and
divert it to another area, workers for Calnev continued to lay the
reinforced pipeline course, said Penman.
   ``Either the pipeline company is going to agree to move the pipe
west of the railroad tracks,'' Penman said, ``or we are going to
keep going to courts until we find one that can exercise
jurisdiction, until there are no courts left to go to.''
   Calnev officials said the replacement line could be in place and
ready to restart sometime next week, barring additional legal
action by the city or further changes from the U.S. Transportation
Department's Office of Pipeline Safety.
   Officials from the company say they will use several new safety
features, such as burying the pipe at twice its former depth and
covering it with concrete and using a thicker, seamless,
plastic-coated pipe. Welds between pipe sections also will be
X-rayed.
   Department of Transportation officials on Tuesday announced
additional requirements for Calnev to follow as they bury the pipe,
including replacement of an additional 1,000 feet and the addition
of a safety valve.
   Calnev operations manager Dave Andries said rerouting the line
may actually be cheaper than the precautions Calnev plans for using
the same course, but the company is concerned with possible flood
damage on the other side of the levee.
   On May 12, a runaway Southern Pacific train derailment in the
same neighborhood on San Bernardino's northwest side killed four
people and injured 11.
   Authorities believe either the train wreck or salvage equipment
brought in to clean it up damaged the 14-inch pipeline, which was
delivering unleaded gasoline to Las Vegas from storage tanks in
Colton. The combined accidents destroyed 22 homes.
   City officials expected to be back in court Friday, either with
a new petition for the federal court or an action for U.S. District
Court in Los Angeles, Penman said. The city also was trying to
negotiate with Calnev out of court, Penman said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller said ``Miami
Vice'' star Don Johnson is ``scum'' who makes millions off the sex
and violence portrayed on television.
   West Virginia's junior senator told a group at the Preston
County Senior Center that ``Miami Vice'' and similar shows
shouldn't be watched by anyone. He also labeled the hit game show
``Wheel of Fortune'' as trash.
   Miami Vice ran for five years on NBC and its last show, a
two-hour special, was shown May 21.
   ``I know Don Johnson, and he is scum,'' Rockefeller told an
obviously delighted crowd of senior citizens Tuesday. ``He's just a
long-haired guy with good looks who makes a bundle selling sex,
drugs and violence on commercial television.''
   A spokesman for Johnson could not immediately be reached for
comment.
   On Thursday, Rockefeller spokesman Brian Detter attempted to
play down the senator's remarks, saying he was only commenting on
the nature of television programs.
   ``The senator was attacking and does condemn the attitudes and
values, such as sex, violence and drugs, portrayed in the TV show,
and not Don Johnson as a person,'' he said.
   Rockefeller made the remarks after being told that the rural
area had a drug problem.
   ``We are losing a generation of our young people,'' Rockefeller
said.

<TEXT>
   A Qantas Airways jumbo jet with 325
people aboard inexplicably pitched upward at 30,000 feet Thursday
and then nose-dived, catapulting passengers around the cabin so
hard they left dents and injuring up to 30 people.
   A Qantas official on Friday described the effect as like a
``roller coaster ride'' for the 305 passengers and 20 crew members
bound for Singapore. The plane, a 747-200, left from Sydney and was
diverted to Darwin, far northern Australia.
   Fleet Manager Capt. Les Hayward said he did not know whether air
turbulence or a fault in the autopilot could have caused the
malfunction.
   He said 61 people were taken to Royal Darwin Hospital, but more
than half of them were relatives of the injured.
   Passenger Judy Maher, 22, of Melbourne, told Australian
Associated Press, ``There was this drop and I saw people, plates,
everything go flying. We hit the ceiling and when we hit the floor
again I was overcome with nausea. There was blood spattered
everywhere.
   ``Stewards were yelling for everyone to be calm, but no one
screamed and there didn't appear to be any panic.''
   Hayward said the aircraft was flying at a cruising speed of
about 520 mph southeast of Derby, Western Australia, when it
suddenly pitched and reared up 1,500 feet before nosing over.
   ``The captain disconnected the autopilot and rolled the aircraft
back to a normal altitude as gently as he could,'' Hayward said.
   ``As the aircraft pitched up the passengers would have been
forced more firmly into their seats as the aircraft rolled over the
top and pitched down again. Some of them did float out of their
seats.''
   A doctor on board treated passengers for bruises and minor
injuries.
   Hayward said the ceiling was dented where people bounced against
the fuselage interior.
   He said there was ``cosmetic damage'' to the rear of the plane,
which later took off for Singapore, Bahrein and Amsterdam. Hayward
said the airline was investigating the cause of the mishap.
   ``It would have been a bit like a roller coaster ride,'' he said.
   Qantas said six passengers were detained overnight. They were
listed in stable condition Friday and most were expected to be
discharged during the day. A cabin attendant was among the injured.
   A former air force fighter navigator aboard the QF5 flight said
he thought the aircraft was going to disintegrate as the pilot
fought for control.
   ``When he opened up the engines, the vibration was incredible. I
thought the wings were going to drop off,'' said 59-year-old Peter
Jensen, who had set out from Sydney with his wife Brigitta on a
round-the-world trip.
   The pilot, Capt. Lyn Williams, was not available for media
interviews.
   Australian Associated Press said at least one dozen passengers
wore medical neck supports. It said the shirt of one man, whose
head was bandaged, was caked with blood.
   ``It felt like we hit an air pocket,'' Jensen said. ``The plane
dived away and I went straight up to the ceiling with a lot of
others. I couldn't be sure we were going to float out of the nose
dip, but we went straight back down to the seats.''
   Jensen said he saw one man smash into an overhead locker,
breaking it off its hinges.
   A 22-year-old Sydney man who received slight neck injuries said
the plane appeared to jerk forward ``in a catapult action.''
   ``It was like being on a trampoline,'' said the man, who spoke
on the condition of not being indentified. ``Then I can only
remember the plane engines roaring out and a lot of vibration.''
   Dutch student Eric Grooters, 24, of Amsterdam, said he had his
seat belt on as he watched his 21 year-old girlfriend, Monique
Lookman, thrown to the plane's roof.
   ``It seemed like everyone was flying around inside the plane,''
Grooters said. ``First the plane seemed to shake and everyone was
terrified.
   ``There were people stretching out in front of me without their
seat belts.''

<HEAD>Former Senate Leader Accused Of Taking Money From Hotel To Push Bill</HEAD>

   A former state Senate president was
indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday on charges he extorted
$15,000 from hotel officials who were lobbying for a casino
gambling law.
   Daniel R. Tonkovich, 43, is accused of extorting money in 1986
from a hotel group called WVCC, which is now bankrupt but at the
time owned the Grande Hotel in Weirton, according to an official
from Tri Mark Management, which now owns the hotel.
   At time of the of the alleged extortion, WVCC was lobbying for
passage of a casino gambling measure in the Legislature, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Nancy Hill.
   Tonkovich also was accused of unsuccessfully trying to extort
money from Resorts International Inc., a Delaware company that
operates the Resorts International Hotel and Casino in Atlantic
City, N.J., Hill said.
   Resorts International also was lobbying for the casino measure,
which eventually was voted down by lawmakers, Hill said. According
to the indictment, Resorts International planned to develop one or
more casinos in West Virginia if the legislation had passed.
   A spokesman for Resorts International had no comment Thursday
night.
   Tonkovich is accused of taking a total of $15,000 in three
extortion payments from WVCC at the same time the casino
legislation was pending, Hill said.
   Repeated calls to Tonkovich's home were not answered Thursday
evening.
   The indictment accuses Tonkovich of accepting the payments by
drawing up a false contract involving an assistant. In return for
the money, the senator pledged to back the casino legislation, the
indictment alleges.
   If convicted on all counts, Tonkovich would face 80 years in
prison and a $1 million fine, Hill said.
   Tonkovich, a Democrat, was elected to the House of Delegates in
1972 and won election to the Senate in 1976. In 1985, he was
elected Senate president.

<HEAD>`Florida Crackers' Opens off-Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs Planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the next to last scene of ``Florida
Crackers,'' somebody mentions that a red tide is coming in and soon
there'll be dead fish on the beach.
   ``Why don't they just swim away?'' asks a character named Lori.
``They don't know any better,'' answers a character named Dean.
It's playwright William S. Leavengood's metaphor for the
increasingly dangerous drug scene in which his characters swim.
   In his play, which opened Thursday at off-Broadway's Circle
Repertory Company, Leavengood has made his grungy people likable,
worth saving and interesting without the audience having to
identify with them. And, though drugs permeate ``Florida
Crackers,'' Leavengood does not glorify them.
   The set, by John Lee Beatty, is the cheaply made Florida
ocean-front house of 30-year-old Joe, played by John C. McGinley.
McGinley gives the play's strongest performance as the father
figure to his two brothers in their 20s, thrown out of a family
split by divorce. Joe peddles dope and sometimes drives delivery
trucks of dope for Dean. McGinley conveys the impression that Joe
has an inner core of integrity. He calls all the men ``son'' and
when McGinley says it, it sounds natural and caring.
   Michael Piontek plays Grant, the second brother, whose luck
always is bad. Scott Rymer plays Russell, the youngest brother,
just out of college, who had the brains to become a doctor, studied
philosophy instead and now does nothing. A warm moment in a play
marked with sadly wasted potential and premonitions of violence has
the three brothers singing the Eagles' ``Take it to the Limit.''
   Brian Jensen plays Strings, a would-be guitarist living in Joe's
house, stoned all the time. Joel Anderson plays Dean, who sees
Mafia and other sharks moving in on his drug-running business and
believes they're out to kill him.
   For lighter moments of a feminine kind, there's the upscale Lori
(Kim Flowers) and the loose, funny Tracey (Cyndi Coyne). Playwright
John Bishop directed Florida-native Leavengood's off-Broadway debut.
   There's no happy ending. When Joe finally could swim away, the
pull of the family he has created with his brothers is stronger and
he does something terrible and stays, their leader, in the deadly
tides of dope.

<TEXT>
   Senate party leaders united Thursday to fight
off a wave of White House-opposed drug spending proposals as
lawmakers debated a bill providing $3.3 billion for veterans and
other domestic programs.
   The measure, for the waning months of the current fiscal year,
includes $1.2 billion for health care and other programs for
veterans that are running low on funds. It also carries $892
million for the Guaranteed Student Loan program for college
students, $423 million for state foster care programs, and other
funds for agencies needing money for the final four months of the
1989 fiscal year.
   Lawmakers went home Thursday evening after nearly 14 hours of
debate and planned to resume work Friday. They adopted amendments
ranging from providing $1 million for development of medicines for
rare diseases, to urging the bankruptcy court handling Eastern
Airlines' bankruptcy proceedings to consider appointing an
independent trustee to replace chief executive Frank Lorenzo in
running the strike-bound carrier.
   But the most controversial aspect of the Senate bill is its
omission of any additional anti-drug money _ unlike a $3.7 billion
version passed by the House on May 24 that contained $822 million
for more prison cells, extra drug agents, improved education
programs and other anti-drug efforts.
   That anti-drug spending was shaved from the legislation by
Senate leaders before it reached the floor, following Bush
administration threats to veto the entire bill over the anti-drug
money. The White House says the extra spending would inflate this
year's already swollen federal deficit and can wait until 1990, and
senior Democratic and Republican senators argued that adding drug
monies would be futile.
   ``This bill is for programs that are broke,'' said Senate
Appropriations Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   However, that did not stop some senators from trying to increase
spending against illicit drug dealers.
   The Senate voted 71-20 to defeat an amendment by Sen. Joseph
Biden, D-Del., that would have spent another $1.8 billion this year
for prevention and treatment programs, grants to local governments,
more federal agents, and other anti-drug measures. The provision
would have raised the money by boosting federal taxes on cigarettes
and alcoholic beverages.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., pressed an amendment diverting $70
million from Defense Department anti-drug efforts to increasing
federal prison space for drug offenders.
   Specter said the money would be ``a little something to show the
American people that Congress does more than pontificate and talk
about the problem.'' He was defeated 77-18.
   A proposal by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., to boost this year's
drug programs by $227 million was defeated 81-15.
   Although the measure exceeds the $2.2 billion supplemental
spending bill President Bush sent Congress in March, the
administration indicated in a statement Thursday that it would
support the Senate proposal ``in view of the need for prompt action
on veterans funding.''
   The legislation includes $342 million for the expenses of
battling last year's forest fires, $225 million for the food stamps
program, $125 million for United Nations peacekeeping forces, $100
million to help Soviet and other refugees to this country, and $91
million for workers whose jobs were lost due to overseas
competition.
   It also contains $7.3 million for cleaning up the Alaska oil
spill.
   As so often happens with spending bills, the legislation has
also picked up less far-reaching provisions that reflect the
interests of members of the Appropriations Committee.
   Thus, it also provides $75 million to rebuild a radio telescope
that toppled in West Virginia, home state of appropriations panel
Chairman Robert Byrd. And it urges the Department of Health and
Human Services to hire more health care workers in Honolulu, thanks
to the efforts of Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, a ranking member of
the committee.
   It also contains $1.6 million for a Philadelphia foundation to
train unemployed people, $1.8 million for a White House Conference
on Library and Information Services, $1.5 million for Puerto Rico's
political parties to conduct a referendum on the island's political
status, and $6.6 million for subsidies for air carriers that serve
small communities.
   A non-binding provision was also included expressing the
Senate's desire to prevent Panamanian ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega from nominating a new administrator to the Panama Canal
Commission. A treaty allows Panama to nominate an administrator for
the U.S. agency, which oversees the canal.
   The language was introduced by Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., and other
conservative Republicans, and was approved on a voice vote.

<HEAD>Three Police Arrested, 10 Fired for Drug Links</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national police said Thursday that
three high-ranking officers were arrested and 10 officers were
fired on charges of working for Colombia's powerful drug
trafficking cartels.
   The force's commander, Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla, said in a
communique his office ``will be inflexible in applying whatever
corrective measures are needed to maintain discipline, order and to
guarantee good service to society.''
   The Bogota newspaper El Tiempo said on Thursday that five
officers have been arrested and 23 expelled from the force in
recent months on corruption charges, including a captain in the
provincial capital of Sincelejo caught with a suitcase full of drug
money.
   Gomez Padilla said drug dealers were trying ``with unusual
persistence to destabilize the nation's institutions.''
   A car bomb blew up on a main Bogota boulevard Tuesday as the
head of Colombia's national bureau of investigation was passing. He
escaped death, but four bystanders were killed. He blamed the
attack on drug traffickers working in conjunction with murderous
right-wing vigilantes.
   It was the latest in a series of assassinations or attempts
against high-ranking justice and police officials in Colombia, a
land plagued by cocaine trafficking, rightist death squads and
leftist guerrilla groups.
   President Virgilio Barco said in an address to cadets at the
military academy on Thursday that such attacks only stiffen
government resolve.
   ``Instead of weakening the fighting will of the country, of our
armed forces and of our security agencies, it generates redoubled
enthusiasm to move ahead,'' he said.

   Scott Isaacs, an eighth-grader from Littleton,
Colo., won the 62nd annual National Spelling Bee on Thursday by
correctly spelling the word ``spoliator.''
   It was the 14-year-old's third time in the national finals. He
defeated Ojas V. Tejani of Hixson, Tenn., in a duel that capped the
two-day finals.
   They were the survivors of the largest field in the bee's
history, outlasting 220 other contestants.
   The word ``spoliator'' means a spoiler.
   In the final rounds, Ojas, a 12-year-old sixth-grader, correctly
spelled ``saponaceous,'' an adjective for something resembling
soap, and Scott countered with the correct spelling of
``ideaphoria,'' which is a capacity for creative thought or
imagination.
   Both spellers, however, missed ``pasigraphy,'' which means an
artificial international written language, and Ojas then missed the
next word, ``senescing,'' which means growing old.
   Scott spelled the word correctly and under contest rules had to
spell the next word correctly. He did and won the $1,500 first
prize.
   Ojas will collect $1,000.
   In third place was Arthur A. Hodge, 14, from Pottsville, Pa.,
who missed ``trinklied,'' a word meaning a drinking song. In fourth
was Samantha Cassell of Johnson City, Tenn., who lost out on the
word ``pedicled,'' which means having a slender stalk.
   Scott was one of seven students competing in the national finals
for the third time.
   He is an eighth-grade pupil at Kent Denver Country Day School in
Englewood, Colo. His father, Bud, is an oil engineer and his
mother, Kaye, is a homemaker.
   He was the 1987 and 1988 Denver spelling champion.
   Ojas is in the sixth grade at St. Nicholas School in
Chattanooga, the son of a chemical engineer, Vinay, and a
homemaker, Indu.
   Scott was to fly to New York later in the day to appear on
Friday's ABC ``Good Morning America,'' and he is booked for next
week on NBC's ``Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.''
   Also, Scott and the entire Indiana delegation of spellers have
been invited to meet on Friday with Vice President Quayle.
   After six rounds, only six boys and nine girls remained. The
next round cut that number to four and four, and only the final
four were left for the ninth round.
   In quick succession, Arthur spelled ``wight,'' a living being;
Samantha spelled ``dihara,'' a buddhist monastery; Ojas had
``halieutics,'' which relates to fishing, and Scott was correct
with ``morion,'' a helmet worn by 16th and 17th century Spanish
footsoldiers.
   In the 10th round, Arthur was correct with ``vigentennial,''
which means once every 20 years, and Ojas had ``stereopsis,'' a
capacity for depth perception; Scott spelled ``diluvial,'' which
concerns a flood or deluge, but Samantha tripped up on ``pedicled.''
   Arthur then lost out with ``trinklied.'' And that left only the
two finalists.
   The winner's eyes brimmed with tears as he was handed the
championship trophy and friends and relatives came to the stage and
embraced him. He also received a handshake from the runner-up and
Ojas' father.
   Scott said that he had been studying 104 dictionary words a day
_ the number that will fit on a shet of computer paper _ since
January. He said he has participated in 15 bees counting local,
regional and national contests, and has won eight of them.
   As for the future, he said, ``I might be into words when I get
older, or I might be a pilot.''
   The runner-up, Ojas, said he had started preparing for spelling
bees when he was in the third grade. He was born in the United
States but said he has visited the area of northern India that his
father comes from.
   There was one tense moment near the end of the competition when
the judges ruled that Melody Yung, 12, of Fall River, Mass., had
misspelled ``salariat,'' a class of salaried persons.
   There were cries of dismay from the audience and a flurry of
activity among the judges. They finally played a tape over the
loudspeaker system, which showed she had spelled the word
``salariet,'' and the judges' ruling stood.

<HEAD>Talent, Technology Coincide in Beardsley Exhibit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The timing couldn't have been better:
talent and technology coincided beautifully at the end of the 19th
century for controversial artist Aubrey Beardsley.
   Though little trained in art and just 25 when he died of
tuberculosis in 1898, the drawings Beardsley made the last six
years of his life are credited with influencing such giants of
20th-century art as Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee and Edvard Munch.
   Beardsley's black and white drawings, usually for book or
magazine illustrations, were printed _ when not suppressed _
through the then new photo-mechanical reproduction process, said
Miriam Stewart, a curatorial associate at Harvard University's Fogg
Art Museum. The reproductions were faithful to the drawings and
cost less than those carved into wood blocks by craftsmen rather
than the artist.
   The Fogg has more than 50 of the drawings, which were donated by
two alumni. They constitute the most important collection of the
artist's work outside Great Britain, said Fogg Curator of Drawings
William Robinson.
   For the first time in six years the drawings are on public
display, and for the first time in more than a dozen years, they
are together in one exhibit. And since the drawings are on paper,
making them delicate and sensitive to light, they can be exhibited
only briefly, museum officials said.
   They will be shown at Harvard's Sackler Museum through July 9
together with other material, including books illustrated by
Beardsley, loaned by Harvard's Houghton Library, the Boston Public
Library and Boston's Museum of Fine Arts.
   Some of the drawings are overtly erotic; others have touches
typical of his mischief.
   He usually started his drawings with pencil and perfected them
with ink, Stewart said. In some, he used graphite.
   His acquaintances included the playwright Oscar Wilde, and
Beardsley became a sensation with his illustrations for Wilde's
play, ``Salome,'' published in 1894. The illustraions were
``described variously as having nothing to do with the play and
everything to do with it,'' Stewart said.
   Included in the Fogg exhibit are two drawings intended for the
book but suppressed from publication.
   The show also includes work done for a reprint of Malory's ``Le
Morte d'Arthur,'' Ben Johnson's ``Volpone,'' Alexander Pope's ``The
Rape of the Lock,'' Aristophanes' ``Lysistrata,'' and for the
periodicals, The Yellow Book and The Savoy.
   Drawings for ``Bon-Mots,'' a collection of witticisms are ``sort
of elaborate doodles ... some quite grotesque,'' Stewart said.
   A voracious reader, Beardsley sometimes exchanged drawings for
books, and it was through this that his career was launched when he
was chosen to illustrate ``Le Morte d'Arthur.'' He was 20.
   Some drawings resemble posters and advertisements. ``He was of
his time, and he was not trying to create a lyrical past,'' Stewart
said.
   Beardsley began writing an erotic novel, but never completed it.
He became a Roman Catholic the year before he died, and on his
death bed asked that some of his drawings be destroyed. The
publisher who had them did not.
   The Fogg's collection came from alumni who had different reasons
for collecting Beardsley's work. Grenville L. Winthrop, who was
graduated in 1889 and who descended from the first governor of
Massachusetts, bequeathed to Harvard 23 original Beardsley drawings
among more than 3,700 art objects.
   Scofield Thayer, class of 1913 and onetime editor and part-owner
of the literary review The Dial, had more than 30 drawings that
became the Fogg's when he died.
   Winthrop liked the lines and design of Beardsley's work; Thayer
liked the daring subject matter, Robinson said.

<TEXT>
   If you're still wondering what to get the June
graduate or the June bride, why not consider a piece of the
American economy. It grows in value. It even beats inflation.
   Such a gift might put a premium on smart stock selection, but
the chances are the appreciation in market value will beat that of
the toaster or vase or whatever other gift you might have in mind.
   There is a drawback right at the start in that a brokerage fee
might be paid if the stock is purchased on the open market. But
once over that hurdle the future of your gift is pretty good.
   If, for instance, you purchased sound common stocks and held
them for five years from 1982 through 1986, you would have enjoyed
an annual return of nearly 20 percent, based on the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index.
   If continued, that sort of return can produce magic. A 20
percent rate, for example, means you double your money in less than
four years, a rate of return that almost defies comprehension over
a long period of time.
   Assume the investment is $100. At the end of the first four-year
period it is worth $200, and at the end of the second period $400.
At this point, eight years have elapsed.
   Should the rate of return be maintained, which frankly is
unlikely, the original $100 becomes $800 by the end of 12 years,
and $1,600 in 16 years. The magic of compounding is at work.
   After 20 years the original amount is around $3,200 and, because
money earned is causing more money to be earned, the rate of
increase is accelerating. Now, 24 years later, it is worth $6,400,
and growing.
   No, it isn't all gravy. During this time the owner of the stock
would have had to pay taxes on the dividends earned. And, while
taxes on the principle amount are deferred until the stock is sold,
they could be sizeable.
   Another caveat: The period chosen was one of the very best of
the century. Returns were high and inflation was low, and that
situation is rather rare. A more likely situation would be an
annual return of 10 percent to 15 percent.
   At the latter rate of return there are dozens of sound,
well-managed companies to choose from. For those whose investing
skills are well-honed, there are stocks that conceivably might even
double those rates.
   And somewhere out there is another IBM or Xerox or Polaroid or
Apple Computer that might grow at an even more dazzling rate. To
find them, however, might involve as much luck as skill.
   The point to remember is that the American economy is a pretty
good investment, one that is attracting huge amounts of money from
Europe and the Far East.
   No investment is without risk, but one explanation for foreign
interest is that America is still, for all its faults, the world's
most politically stable large nation and one of the soundest _ even
most progressive _ economically.
   For those who don't have sufficient time to get the shares
recorded, it might suffice to inform the recipient that a certain
sum has been set aside in his or her name and invested in such and
such a stock.
   But if you accept that advice you had better be prepared to
follow through. The pay off may be more than you had bargained on.

   Eskimo women used moss. Navajo squaws used soft
bark. European women knit them from wool.
   For thousands of years, diapering has been women's work. So it's
no surprise women are championing innovative alternatives to the 18
billion ecologically suspect disposable diapers plopped into
landfills or incinerated each year.
   In the process, these women have spawned a cottage industry
built around cloth diapers.
   Gone are the days of pins, stuck babies and leaky plastic pants.
The advent of the diaper wrap _ a panty-like cover that fastens
snugly with Velcro and holds a diaper in place without pins _ has
simplified cloth diapering, making it a more convenient alternative
and the method of choice for a growing number of parents.
   ``My main concern was that I didn't want to put plastic on my
baby. I wanted breathability and cloth, not paper,'' said Margorie
Magidow, 38 and mother of three.
   In 1983, Magidow concocted her own diaper wrap, sewing a cover
that surrounds a cotton diaper and is fastened with Velcro. She
added some pizzazz with color, made them relatively cheaply and
used breathable, quick-drying nylon.
   Today she runs a factory with 20 sewers who turned out the more
than 50,000 Rubber Duckies wraps sold last year through her R. Duck
Co. in Santa Barbara, Calif.
   ``I'd say in the last six months interest has almost doubled
because so many people are switching to cloth,'' Magidow said.
   In Asheville, N.C., Becky Kubota is swamped distributing Nikkys,
plush wraps made in Japan, where cloth diapers are the standard
among the middle and upper classes.
   Kubota, 37, had her first baby in Japan 10 years ago and says
she was in the right place at the right time to become a Nikkys
distributor when she returned home.
   ``The business is really coming to me _ I haven't done a lot to
market it,'' Kubota said. Last year 120,000 Nikkys wraps were sold
nationwide; that number should double this year, she said.
   Then there's Biobottoms Inc., an 8-year-old company housed in an
old chicken coop in a rural pocket of Marin County, Calif. Joan
Cooper and Anita Dimondstein, former college roommates now in their
40s, founded the company on $3,000 in pursuit of an alternative to
plastic pants for their kids.
   This year they expect to sell 67,000 Biobottoms wraps, which
they import from Japan.
   Cooper and Dimondstein originally envisioned a home business
that would occupy some of their time while they raised their
families. Today Biobottoms employs more than 50 people and puts out
a catalog that carries 120 products ranging from wraps to
playclothes to books like ``Koko Bear's New Potty.''
   Some parents launder diapers, but more often they rely on diaper
services that deliver clean cotton diapers and pick up the soiled
ones from homes. The services generally do not provide wraps
because they are difficult to mass-launder.
   A week's worth of diapers from a service costs $8 to $15,
cheaper than their disposable counterparts. (Assuming a baby needs
80 diapers a week, disposables cost anywhere from $17.50 to $20.)
   But the wraps, which come in various sizes, are an added
expense. Madigow's Rubber Duckies sell for about $5.50 apiece,
while the top-of-the-line woolen Nikky costs $16. Companies
recommend parents purchase five or six wraps, each of which lasts
through several diaper changes.
   Wool is considered the best material because it's highly
absorbent and doesn't get cold when wet, but cotton covers are more
popular because they're cheaper.
   Dr. George Sterne, a New Orleans pediatrician and professor at
Tulane University, said he believes babies get fewer rashes with
cloth diapers and prefers them if they are used without plastic
pants, which provide a warm breeding ground for infections.
   According to Biobottoms' Cooper, plastic can raise temperatures
inside the diaper to as high as 104 degrees. ``Imagine wearing a
shower cap 24 hours a day,'' she said.
   While no studies have been conducted on who uses cloth diapers,
many advocates suspect it's an upper-middle class trend. ``These
are environmentally conscious people who shop from catalogs,''
Kubota said. ``They're people who take more time to make a purchase
decision.''
   Sterne generally agreed.``People who are very low income don't
have washing machines and can't get diaper service,'' he said.

   As the Spanish tenor Jose Carreras lay in a
Seattle hospital battling leukemia, music helped him to get through
the ordeal. Music, he says, ``has this spiritual strength.''
   ``Every day, I was listening to music with a Walkman in my
sterilized room. One of the pieces _ I had to hear it every day _
was Rachmaninoff's `Piano Concerto No. 2.' I was listening to many
versions of it, also Rachmaninoff playing it himself,'' said
Carreras who gave a recital at Carnegie Hall on May 25, his first
appearance in more than two years.
   ``The most important thing for me was to save my life. All the
rest came after this,'' he said.
   Carreras' leukemia is now in remission. ``Now I'm not under any
kind of treatment. I have a routine blood test once a month, that's
all. I travel around, I play some sports, I eat anything, drink
anything. There are no limitations in my life.''
   He makes long-range plans, including a co-production next year
between several European TV networks on the great opera singer
Enrico Caruso.
   Audiences are delighted as the 42-year-old Carreras makes his
``comeback'' recitals.
   He performed last July before 150,000 in Barcelona, and also
appeared in Vienna, at the Vatican and in other European cities.
This spring he was in Seattle, Washington and New York. In
February, he recorded Saint-Saens' ``Samson et Dalila'' and since
has recorded Halevy's ``La Juive'' for Philips. In July, he'll
return to opera, where he made his fame, singing in Barcelona in
Cherubini's ``Medea'' with soprano Montserrat Caballe.
   Carreras is ranked as one the top tenors in the world. But he
was often taken to task for vocal roughness, believed to be caused
by singing too often and singing roles too heavy for his voice, so
that he had to press for volume.
   ``Before, my career was the most important thing in my life,''
he said. ``Like anybody who succeeds, I had to fight a lot and have
a lot of discipline. Now, I'm more interested to have the
opportunity to sing on stage again and communicate with people
through my voice.''
   Carreras thinks his voice is essentially the same, but rested.
``I was lying in a hospital for nine months. It was a hard period.
But my vocal chords were resting. Thank God all the therapy and
treatments and radiation did not affect my vocal chords or mucous
membranes.
   ``Maybe as a singer I'm a little deeper or more mature. There is
a parallel between the artist and the human being.''
   He plans to include more lyrical roles in my repertoire as he
gets back to work. ``What is going to change for sure is the rhythm
of my career. I don't plan to sing more than three or four times in
one month and to have, if possible, a month of holiday every year.
   ``I'm going to enjoy not only my professional life, that is what
I did for 17 years, but to enjoy also the human side of my life
more than before,'' he said. Carreras has two children, Alberto,
15, and Julia, 10.
   ``I don't regret at all that I concentrated so much on my
profession. I had a wonderful life.''
   Carreras, who sang the part of Tony on the ``West Side Story''
record conducted by Leonard Bernstein, made the soundtrack for a
``La Boheme'' film in May 1987. That was when he fell ill.
   The diagnosis was acute lymphocytic leukemia. His doctors in
Spain recommended that he go to Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Institute. Seattle also appealed to Carreras because he
felt he would be less of a media event there than in Europe.
   ``The treatment was bone marrow transplant. They took out my
bone marrow, treated it and gave it back to my body. This is a
revolutionary treatment which needs more and more research,'' he
said. To this end, the singer founded the Jose Carreras
International Foundation for the Prevention of Leukemia.
   ``It is unbelievable the thousands of letters, messages,
telegrams, phone calls,'' he said. ``This really touched me so
much. I think that gave me even more the strength to fight.''
   His next opera appearance after ``Medea'' will be in a new opera
about Columbus, which was postponed when he became sick. Now he'll
sing the title role in September in Barcelona. ``After this, I
think I will go back to opera in Vienna, Covent Garden, La Scala
and the Metropolitan Opera.''
   His time will be divided three ways, Carreras said, among
``singing new roles, new recitals, new recordings; free time _
pleasure, sports, friends; and the foundation _ meetings,
appointments, traveling, besides all the performances I give to
benefit the foundation. I have to tell you my life is quite busy
even though I sing less.
   ``I do everything with such a joy, you cannot imagine.''

<HEAD>An Emotional Escape From Australia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jill Ker Conway was a smart little girl
who survived the Australian wilderness and grew up to be an
intellectual refugee fleeing an impossible mother and a sexist
society.
   It's a sometimes harrowing story the 54-year-old historian,
feminist and former president of Smith College tells in her memoir,
``The Road From Coorain'' (Knopf, $18.95).
   Right through to the close of her account, she voices the pained
discontent that has sent many Australians far from that isolated
island continent in the Pacific. The memoir ends in 1960 at the
airport in Sydney, standing on the tarmac of long goodbyes. She is
26 and on her way to study American history at Harvard University.
   ``I was leaving because I didn't fit in, never had, and wasn't
likely to,'' she writes. ``I was going to another country. To begin
all over again. ...
   ``Where, I wondered, would my bones come to rest? It pained me
to think of them not fertilizing Australian soil.''
   Since landing here, the Australian expatriate has made a
brilliant career. She earned a doctorate at Harvard, served as the
first woman vice president at the University of Toronto and, in
1975, began a 10-year stint at Smith that put her on the cover of
Time magazine as a woman to watch in the Year of Women.
   Congressmen solicited her opinion on education so often that in
1978 she became a U.S. citizen. Her honorary degrees could paper a
large wall and she serves on a slew of corporate boards, from
Colgate-Palmolive to Nike.
   Now a visiting scholar and teacher at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, she is turning out an unconventional
trilogy she hopes will light a fire under a generation grown
complacent about equal rights for women. One book is about Third
World women; a second will be a women's history of the past 25
years in the context of American life; the third is her memoir,
which offers a personal view of women in a world run by men.
   Jill Ker Conway is a tall, genteel woman who speaks in a
near-whisper and has an inquisitive, open face. She has no regrets
about leaving the land of her birth, she said in a recent interview.
   Australia ``is a culture obsessed with the anarchic male hero
from Ned Kelly (a revered Australian outlaw) to `Crocodile
Dundee,''' she said. ``Men in Australia suffer a great deal from
having that as an ideal. Women have no territory in that country.
   ``It's not that I don't like men. But you need a world that
recognizes there are two sexes.''
   Conway's account of how she broke away from that place tells of
a young woman who battled outrageous misfortune to fulfill her
potential. In a stunningly direct, no-nonsense Australian way, she
describes a sometimes harrowing childhood, the emerging power of
her largely self-taught intellect and her anguished decision to
leave her bitter and possessive mother.
   For starters, she explains that she wasn't even meant to be born.
   Her mother and father were eking out a life on Coorain _ an
aboriginal word meaning ``windy place,'' an 18,000-acre sheep
station in the flat plains of outback New South Wales, Australia's
southeastern quadrant. The Kers settled there in 1929 during a
drought.
   They already had two sons when Mrs. Ker discovered in 1934 that
she was pregnant again. A nurse-gone-bush, she attempted in vain to
abort the fetus. Jill Ker was born without incident, however.
   At Coorain, the family lived in a weatherboard bungalow with
wide verandas and a corrugated iron roof. It was a lonely place of
punishing heat in summer and the alternating threat of floods and
fatal dry spells. Sustenance in the early days consisted of meat,
potatoes, eggs and pickles. When it rained there was wild spinach,
but in the general absence of fresh fruit and vegetables, there was
cod liver oil and lime juice.
   The family read by kerosene lamps the books that arrived in the
mail from a lending library 500 miles away in Sydney.
   The sheep station prospered, however. By age 6, Conway was
helping her father muster sheep, check fences and maintain
windmills. He also taught her to be stoical and not to cry. But
drought returned and five years of dust storms, dying sheep and a
depressed father came to a tragic end when the father drowned
trying to extend piping in a dam. Conway was 10.
   The family packed up and moved to Sydney. There the precocious
autodidact with a huge vocabulary from all those borrowed books was
accepted at an elite girls school. She went on to the prestigious
University of Sydney and graduated at the top of her class. But
when she tried to join the Australian foreign service she was
turned down on grounds that she was too attractive and too
intellectually aggressive.
   All the while her mother grew increasingly critical and
dependent. Violating her own sense of duty and quiet suffering,
Conway decided she had enough and fled to Harvard.
   ``It helped cinch the decision that Boston and Cambridge were
about as far away from Sydney as one can get on this planet, and
that I'd be totally safe from family visits,'' she wrote.
   In the nearly 30 years since then, Jill Ker married Canadian
John Conway, now 73 and a retired historian. They spent 11 years
teaching in Canada until 1975 when she took over at Smith.
   In her decade in Northampton running the prestigious liberal
arts college, Conway introduced major programs in business
management and women's studies, enriched Smith's endowment from $82
million to $179 million and, for the first time, made room among
the school's 2,500 places for older women and welfare mothers.
   She said the book of her early life was written for several
reasons, including honoring the courage of her parents and
recording a vanished way of life. There's a feminist message too.
   ``It is very important to find some rhetoric that will
communicate to a broad public about feminist issues,'' Conway said.
``Young women think they're all solved.''

it's OK to ``just say who'' is using. Now judges want drug
offenders to name their suppliers.
   A month after judges in Knox and Anderson counties began asking
it, they say the question is worthwhile. But defense attorneys and
even the Knox County sheriff wonder whether it violates protections
against self-incrimination, ends judges' neutrality, puts
defendants at risk and threatens other cases.
   ``It seems to me there's everything to gain and nothing to lose,
assuming I'm not trampling on their constitutional rights,'' said
Knox County Criminal Court Judge Randy Nichols, who figures most of
his criminal cases boil down to drug use.
   Criminal court judges in the two counties on May 5 began asking
people convicted of possession or sale of drugs to name their
suppliers in a program modeled after one in Columbus, Neb. The
judges consider defendants' cooperation in deciding plea bargains,
and refusal could earn a contempt of court charge, punishable by up
to 10 days in jail and a $50 fine.
   In Columbus, Platte County Juvenile Court Judge Gerald Rouse
says more than 40 other jurisdictions have called for information
on the county's year-old policy requiring offenders to name
suppliers of drugs or alcohol.
   ``Frankly, we don't have to do it very often. Once the word got
around and the first two went to jail, we didn't have much of a
problem,'' Rouse said.
   The policy has led to only a half-dozen supplier convictions, he
said.
   In Tennessee, if a supplier name surfaces, it's up to a
prosecutor to take it down and decide whether to investigate
further, Nichols said. So far only a handful of cases have evoked
the question.
   When James Daugherty of Oak Ridge sought probation on a charge
of selling cocaine, Anderson County Criminal Court Judge James
Scott asked it.
   Daugherty named ``Crazy Joe'' as his supplier. ``Crazy Joe''
Newton, it turned out, had been found dead earlier in the year.
   Scott gave Daugherty four years in prison, not because of his
answer but rather his background. Daugherty may have been telling
the truth, Scott said, but he notes the convenience and wonders
whether there will be an onslaught of ``phantom sellers.''
   Nichols asked the question May 17 of Jeffrey Clark Evans, who
agreed to plead guilty to robbery, assault and marijuana charges in
exchange for a 17-year sentence. Defense attorney Bob Simpson
objected and told his client not to answer because the judge was no
longer neutral. Simpson also said the question violated his
client's Fifth Amendment right because police could go to the
supplier who in turn could implicate Evans on unrelated crimes.
   Nichols took no action and scheduled another hearing on the case.
   Other defense attorneys, including Bob Ritchie of Knoxville,
believe appeals courts may kill the policy.
   ``For 200 years we have administered criminal justice by the
investigative method,'' Ritchie said. ``To require a person to give
evidence of any kind is an inquisitorial method of criminal
justice. That is abhorrent to the basic foundations of freedom on
which this country is founded.''
   Nichols said conviction means loss of Fifth Amendment rights,
and that the judges aren't interested in further charging that
person. ``If he tells me Joe Jones sold it and another week someone
else tells us Joe Jones sold it, that'll be useful information for
the attorney general,'' he said.
   Knox County Sheriff Joe Fowler, who favors the policy generally,
wonders whether offenders' safety might be hurt or if another,
pending investigation damaged by asking the supplier question in a
public courtroom. Nichols said prosecutors could interview the
offender privately and report to the judge.
   ``All the kinks aren't ironed out yet,'' he said.
   In Nebraska, the policy also was questioned regarding
constitutionality but is unchallenged legally. It has mainly been
aimed at juveniles, who could lose their drivers' licenses for
refusing to answer, but adults could face jail.
   ``I can't say it's as successful as I'd like it to be,'' Rouse
said.
   In Platte County, with 27,000 residents, there are usually about
130 cases of minors possessing alcohol and 20 of drug possession a
year, he said. ``What leads into the heavier drugs is the
consumption of alcohol and marijuana...
   ``If we don't let them get away with the small things, they
won't even think about the big stuff.''

   Forget the story that nectarines are a cross between a peach and
plum. Nectarines are a unique fruit that originally grew wild in
Asia. The California supply is appearing at produce counters now
and will peak in late June through August.
   The lovely red blush on nectarine skins is related to variety,
not ripeness. The fruit is picked mature but firm for packing and
shipping. When you get nectarines home, place them in a loosely
closed paper bag for several days to complete ripening. Don't
refrigerate _ this interrupts the ripening process. Even ripe
nectarines are most flavorful at room temperature. One pound (3
medium nectarines) makes about 2 cups sliced.
   FRESH NECTARINE PIE
   1-3rd cup all-purpose flour
   1-3rd cup sugar
   1-3rd cup packed brown sugar
   1-3rd cup sliced almonds, toasted
   { teaspoon ground nutmeg
   2 teaspoons lemon juice
   Few drops almond extract
   7 cups sliced fresh nectarines (about 9 fruits)
   Pastry for 9-inch double-crust pie
   1 slightly beaten egg white
   1 tablespoon sugar
   In a large bowl stir together flour, 1-3rd cup sugar, brown
sugar, almonds, nutmeg, lemon juice and almond extract. Gently toss
with nectarines. Mound fruit into pastry-lined 9-inch pie plate;
adjust top crust. Seal and flute edge. Brush pastry with egg white;
sprinkle with 1 tablespoon sugar. Cut slits to allow escape of
steam. Cover edge of pie with foil. Bake in 375-degree F oven for
30 minutes; remove foil and bake 20 to 25 minutes more or until
crust is golden. Cool on wire rack. Makes 8 servings.

   Yes, you can enjoy microwave oven-fried chicken and still get a
crisp coating. It's not quite as crispy as pan-fried but much lower
in fat and more healthful. The secret? Coat only the meaty side of
each piece and cook meaty side up. That way there's no coating on
the bottom to absorb juices and become soggy. Cover with paper
towels _ not a cover, plastic wrap or waxed paper _ so moisture can
escape.
   MICROWAVE CHICKEN DIJON
   1 tablespoon margarine or butter
   \ cup fine dry seasoned bread crumbs
   1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes
   { teaspoon paprika
   2 whole medium chicken breasts (12 ounces each), skinned and
halved lengthwise
   1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
   For coating, in a 1-cup measure cook margarine, uncovered, on
100 percent power (high) for 30 to 40 seconds or until melted. In a
small mixing bowl combine bread crumbs, parsley flakes and paprika.
Toss with melted butter.
   Rinse chicken pieces and pat dry. On waxed paper brush pieces
with mustard. Dip each piece into crumb mixture, coating the
meatier side and leaving the other side uncoated. In a
microwave-safe 8- by 8- by 2-inch baking dish arrange pieces,
coated side up, on a rack, with meaty portions toward edges of the
dish. Cover with paper towels. Cook on high for 8 to 10 minutes or
until no pink remains, giving the dish a half-turn every 3 minutes.
Makes 4 servings.

<BYLINE>HEAD: Tips for selecting tomatoes    ___ ^By EARL ARONSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When you shop for tomatoes, you take what
looks good and firm. You hope it will taste good. Tomato varieties
are not labeled in the supermarket, but when you buy tomato plant
seedlings, you have a wide selection.
   A team of scientists at the Florida Agricultural Experiment
Station at Bradenton, Fla., make 800 plant crosses annually in
search of better tomatoes. They evaluate about 40,000 plants each
year.
   The plant breeder's goal is to increase disease and insect
resistance, improve flavor, increase plant yield, and improve the
size of the fruit and the form for shipping to market.
   If you buy tomato seedlings, you'll notice the letters (at least
some of them) V, F, N or T after the variety name. These refer to
the seedlings' resistance to verticillium wilt, fusarium wilt,
nematodes or tobacco mosaic plant diseases. Disease tolerance is
very important, especially if you plant in the same place every
year in a small garden plot.
   It's also important to consider the variety's growth habit;
whether it is determinate or indeterminate.
   Determinate varieties are those that ripen pretty much at the
same time _ a boon, for instance, if you will be canning or making
sauces or juices.
   Indeterminate plants will continue growth and production during
the season, providing fruit until frost. The precise number of days
to maturity will vary with the weather.
   Plant tomatoes 30 to 36 inches apart, using stocky, healthy
plants in full sun, in moist, well-drained soil. Cage or stake
tomato plants to speed ripening, save space, and to keep fruits
from rotting on the ground. Plastic mulch will help keep moisture
in the ground around the plants to hasten ripening and to discourge
weeds.
   Some tomatoes do better than others in patio containers.
   Select the tomato you prefer according to size and taste. Some
people prefer tart tomatoes, while others enjoy sweet ones.
   For size, choose small cherry tomatoes for salads or dipping;
pear or plum-shaped tomatoes for preserves; pasta types for sauce,
ketchup and canning; beefsteak tomatoes for slicing.
   The following tomato recipes were provided by Wayne Hawkins,
executive vice president of the Florida Tomato Exchange:
   BAKED TOMATOES AU GRATIN
   2 pounds tomatoes
   } teaspoon salt

   Four women in white lab coats seat
themselves in a row of cubicles. Before each is a tray with a
disposable cup, a glass of water, a paper graph and six amber
bottles of rancid milk.
   They take a swig from each bottle and swish it inside their
mouths. They grimace, spit into the disposable cups and rinse their
mouths with water. They scribble. Then on to the next amber bottle.
   When the tasting and scribbling are done, each shoves her tray
through a metal slot in the cubicle.
   Tester No. 1 wipes her mouth and says, ``Let me see if I can
find a candy bar somewhere.'' They all laugh.
   The women are graduate students at the University of Tennessee's
Department of Food Technology and Science, and they're putting
their persnickety palates to work at the department's Sensory
Laboratory, in the building's basement.
   These days the testers are trying to find out exactly how long
it takes milk to get rancid and to distinguish between degrees of
rancidness. Also, they are developing exact, descriptive words that
they hope will become standard language for dairy producers and
grocery stores or anyone else dealing with milk.
   The lab has also tested such experimental treats as sweet potato
yogurt, shrimp-flavored snack chips, mutton patties with various
animal fats, and microwave-baked cakes.
   The information is published in scientific magazines such as the
Journal of Food Science and the Journal of Food Quality. Sometimes
food companies themselves hire the lab and its testers to find out
how omission or substitution of certain ingredients affects their
products, whether preservatives affect flavor or whether people
like the food.
   ``There are basically three different kinds of tests,'' says
Marjorie Penfield, professor of grain and baking sensory
evaluation. ``There's one on whether products are different. For
example, if a company wants to change an ingredient in a product to
something cheaper. Or maybe the company's supplier doesn't make the
same ingredient any more.
   ``Then there's description of the quality of that product. In
industry, highly trained panelists are used to describe the
product. They have to be able to taste the product and completely
describe it and the intensity of those qualities. People are
realizing we have to have some kind of standard lexicology.
   ``We also do testing in which you ask whether the person likes
the product,'' Penfield says.
   The laboratory testers tend to specialize. There are panels that
zero in on green beans and panels that study the difference between
steaks from grass-fed and grain-fed cattle.
   Some of the rancid milk panelists also evaluate microwave-baked
cakes as to their air pockets, resistance to cutting, crumbliness
and springiness (the degree to which 2 centimeters of cake return
to original form 2 seconds after being compressed).
   ``We smash it down with a fork and then measure how much it
sprang up,'' says tester Marsha McNeil.
   Other areas of cake study are ``cell size'' (size of holes in
the cake), ``moisture release'' (amount of wetness or oiliness
released in the mouth by the cake), and ``cohesiveness of mass''
(degree to which cake holds together for up to 10 chews). Aftermath
qualities such as ``adhesion to teeth'' (amount of cake stuck to
teeth after swallowing) also are noted.
   Some foods almost defy precise description, and panelists must
be nearly on the same wavelength, Penfield says.
   ``With grass-fed beef you're looking for a grassy flavor,'' she
says. ``It doesn't really taste like grass. I have a hard time
describing it but I certainly notice it when I taste it,'' she
explained as other testers nodded in agreement.
   ``It's described as a milky-oily flavor. It's the type of beef
found in the less expensive steak houses,'' she says.

<UNK>HEAD: Kids choose pizza as their No.1 food    ___</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pizza is the favorite food among kids 6 to 14
years of age, according to a recent poll by the editors of Kid City
and 3-2-1 Contact magazines.
   Over 25 percent of the more than 12,000 respondents to the
magazines' survey selected pizza as their favorite food. Most of
those said they thought that pizza was probably bad for them, but
they liked it anyway.
   The survey showed that kids sometimes have their nutritional
facts wrong, as is the case with pizza, which is basically a
nutritious food.
   In other cases, kids know a food like fish, for example, is good
for them, but they seldom eat it, even though they may like it.
Some 82 percent reported that they know fish is healthful and 52
percent said they like it, yet only 34 percent eat it regularly _
possibly because their parents don't prepare it for them.
   As for vegetables _ nearly 61 percent of the respondents between
the ages of 6 to 10 said they regularly eat vegetables, even though
they may not like them. In the 8 to 14-year-old category, 82
percent said they regularly include vegetables among the foods they
eat.
   The magazines are urging their young readers to eat vegetables,
unsweetened cereals, fresh fruit and yogurt, and to avoid lots of
fried foods and fizzy soft drinks.
   Kid City and 3-2-1 Contact magazines are published by the
Children's Television Workshop, which produces ``Sesame Street''
and other educational television programs.
   A book by the Children's Television Workshop, ``Parents Guide to
Feeding Your Kids Right,'' which deals with good nutrition from
birth through the teen-age years, is scheduled for publication this
year by Prentice Hall Press.

   HONORED CHEF=
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) _ The Maitres Cuisiniers de France and the
Academie Culinaire de France have voted Georges Perrier of Le
Bec-Fin restaurant in Philadelphia ``Chef of the Year.'' The award
was presented here recently.
   The Academie Culinaire de France was founded in 1883 by Joseph
Favre, author of the ``Universal Dictionary of Cuisine.'' The
organization is designed to uphold classic standards, modernize
recipes and promote an understanding and appreciation of French
cuisine and culture.
   The Maitres Cuisiniers de France was founded in 1952 as a way
for chef-owners to promote through apprenticeships the techniques
of French gourmet cooking, to advance culinary philosophy, and to
foster individuality among master chefs and restaurateurs.

   ``Colleges and universities follow standard guidelines in
determining financial need. They do not penalize those who have
saved for education.
   ``For example, if parents have accumulated $100,000 in assets,

private space.
   _ Accessory Apartments: These are in underoccupied single-family
houses that are large enough to accommodate a separate apartment
with its own entrance.
   _ Elderly Cottage Housing Opportunity: These self-contained
units are built for an elderly parent on your own house lot. Many
of these dwellings are prefabricated.
   _ Retirement and ``Life-Care'' Communities: These range from
places for those in good health to those who need 24-hour nursing
care. Some have rental apartments, co-ops, condos, one-family

   Although gravity was the first discovered of the four known
natural forces that govern events in nature, it is the least
understood and the only force that humans cannot control, says
National Geographic.
   
   
   Gravity rules the universe, but any kitchen magnet's
electromagnetic field is stronger _ over a space of a few inches _
than the Earth's entire gravitational field.
   
   
   Earth's gravity field is so weak that when you pick up a rock,
your muscles are easily overcoming the pull of the planet's entire
6.6 sextillion tons.
   
   
   Was Galileo wrong? Some scientists today suggest that a
mysterious, previously unknown natural force may counteract
gravity, making objects fall at different, not the same, rates of
acceleration.
   
   
   Some scientists today believe that a previously unknown natural
anti-gravity force makes an iron weight fall more slowly, although
to an extremely small degree, than an aluminium one, says National
Geographic.
   
   
   If humans could harness the mysterious, anti-gravity force that
some scientists suspect may exist in nature, someday there might be
craneless construction and cableless elevators.
   
   
   Gravity governs the height and shape of our bodies, also
dictating the size and shape of organs and limbs.
   
   
   In the aging process, sagging skin and organs, varicose veins,
arthritis, and failing hearts all result partly from the losing
battle against gravity.
   
   
   If humans had evolved on the moon, with one-sixth Earth's
gravity, they might be double their height but too spindly to play
basketball; on Jupiter, they might look like pancakes with short
legs, says National Geographic.
   
   
   Gravity meters may someday be used by security agents because
they can detect extremely subtle changes in an intruder's position
and can even find a person behind a wall.
   
   
   Gravity ultimately could cause the end of the universe, some
physicists think, if its current expansion eventually reverses
itself in a massive gravitational contraction.
   
   
   Congress chartered the ``nation's attic,'' the Smithsonian
Institution, on Aug. 10, 1846. It was named in honor of English
scientist Joseph Smithson, whose bequest of $500,000 made it
possible. Smithson's will directed the money be used ``for the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.''
   
   
   Missouri became the 24th state in 1821.
   
   
   Herbert Clark Hoover, the 31st president of the United States,
was born in West Branch, Iowa, in 1874.
   
   
   In 1921, Franklin D. Roosevelt was stricken with polio while at
his summer home on the island of Campobello.
   
   
   The National Military Establishment was renamed the Department
of Defense in 1949.
   
   
   According to American humorist Will Rogers: ``What's the matter
with the world today? Why, there ain't nothing but one word wrong
with every one of us, and that's selfishness.''

<NOTE>By READER'S DIGEST</NOTE>
<NOTE>For The Associated Press</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A flagstone patio is attractive, practical and creates a bridge
between your house and the outdoors.
   It is best built on a level or gently sloping site. When
designing it, consider shade, privacy and access from the house.
Avoid placing it where an overhanging roof will drip water on it as
heavy rains can cause the stones to settle unevenly.
   Flagstones come in many sizes, starting at a nominal 12-inch
stone and increasing by 6-inch increments to 36 inches and
occasionally 42 inches. In reality, the stones are slightly
smaller, by about a {-inch in each direction. Use the nominal size
in your plans since a small space is left between stones.
   Although sold as 1{ inches thick, they actually range from 1{ to
2 inches. Compensate for this by putting more or less san}Wdy|3x~d
beneath each stone.
   When ordering, specify the size of your patio. (The length and
width should be divisible by six inches.)
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Base:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _ Lay the patio on a 3-inch bed of sand over a 4-inch gravel
base, for drainage. (In areas where ground freezes, it is best to
lay a patio on a reinforced concrete base.)
   _ Use crushed aggregate for the gravel and concrete sand, which
is coarser than mason's sand.
   _ Order these by the cubic yard. To calculate the amount needed,
multiply thickness by width by length. Be sure all measurements are
in feet (for example, 4 inches equals 1-3rd foot). Then divide the
product by 27.

   1. When the flagstones arrive, measure each and record its
dimensions.
   2. Make a scale drawing of the patio on graph paper. Let 1 inch
equal 1 foot.
   3. Using colored paper, cut out a shape representing each stone.
Label each piece, and move the pieces around on the graph paper
until you get a pleasing pattern.
   4. Paste the shapes on the graph paper. This is your plan.

<NOTE>Tools:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   You will need a spade, iron rake, wheelbarrow, hand cart
(optional), prybar, stonemason's chisel, mason's hammer or steel
mallet, hammer, broom, garden hose, safety goggles, disposable
paintbrush, carpenter's level, string, scissors, 4-d galvanized
nails, 1-by-8 pine for forms, 1-by-4 stakes 11 to 12 inches long,
creosote, a 2-by-4 for leveling and another for tamping.

<NOTE>Construction:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   1. Drive temporary stakes at the patio corners, allowing 1{
inches extra on each side for wooden forms. Run string between the
stakes to outline the patio. Measure the diagonals. If the patio is
a true rectangle, they will be equal.
   2. Dig out the soil to a depth of 8{ inches. Be sure the bottom
of the excavation is level. Set aside some turf and topsoil for
later use.
   3. Paint creosote on the 1-by-8 boards for the forms. Also paint
permanent 1-by-4 stakes.
   4. Place the 1-by-8 boards around the perimeter of the
excavation. Drive the permanent stakes at the corners and
additional stakes where the ends of the boards meet. Nail stakes to
form boards with 4-d nails.
   5. Spread gravel in the excavated area to a depth of 4 inches.
Rake it smooth, then use a 2-by-4 level to pack it. Place
carpenter's level on top of the 2-by-4 and move it around to check
the gravel is level.
   6. Spread sand over the gravel. Level and pack it.
   7. Begin laying stones, following the pattern you made. Leave a
{-inch gap between stones. Stand on each stone to make sure it
doesn't teeter. Use a prybar to raise one edge of the stone to
shift its position or to add or remove sand beneath it to make it
level with the other stones. Tamp stones down with a rubber mallet.
   8. Mix sand with some topsoil. Spread the mixture on the patio
and sweep it into the spaces between the stones. Water the surface
to pack down the mixture. Let dry. Repeat with more sand and soil
until the joints are filled. Pack the edges of the patio and cover
the dirt with the turf removed earlier.
   9. Perimeter stones may have to be cut to fit. If so, wear
safety goggles. Pencil a line where a piece is to be cut. Score
along the line, using a chisel and hammer or steel mallet. Score a
line on opposite face. Place a board under the stone, with the
section to be removed overhanging. Tap the excess section with the
hammer or mallet until it breaks off.

   Q. _ The wallboard in our living room needs patching. I can
handle most of the job, but I'm not sure how to go about filling
the few spots where there are openings in the wall without anything
behind them. Can I apply masking tapes over each opening and then
cover with a patching compound?
   A. _ Yes, but one of the modern products that will fill the bill
is a ready-made patch available in most paint stores and home
centers. Tape it on according to the directions and you will find
it easy to disguise the patch when it is painted.

<TEXT>
   Q. _ One of the double-hung windows in our house has gone
haywire. I am fairly certain the trouble is with the sash cord. Can
the cord be removed or is it too much of a job?
   A. _ Removing the sash is not difficult. Merely take off the
stop mouldings on the inside. Use a chisel or putty knife and work
very carefully, especially if you intend to use the mouldings
again. If your aim is to replace the sash cord with another of the
same type, be sure to observe how the cord is connected so you will
be able to replace it without too much trouble. Before you do this,
however, look into the kinds of sash cords now on the market. They
are easier to use and install and are virtually indestructible.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q. _ We want to paint the concrete walkway around the swimming
pool at the back of our house. Can a latex paint be used or is it
better to use an oil-based paint?
   A. _ Latex paint formulated for use on concrete is generally
considered better than an oil-based paint for such a purpose. Epoxy
paints are considered tops, but cost more.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q. _ We have an old bedroom bureau. It seems in very good shape,
but the finish is kind of messy. We do not know what kind of finish
it is, except we know it isn't paint. Will we be able to remove it
with an ordinary varnish remover or is something special required
if the finish is shellac, lacquer or something else?
   A. _ Go ahead with the varnish remover. The finish will yield to
it whether it is varnish, shellac or lacquer. What will determine
the toughness of your job is how many coats are on it. After the
varnish remover is left on the amount of time recommended on the
label, try a little scraping with a putty knife or scraper. If it
yields fairly easy, go ahead with the work. If it seems to resist,
apply another coat of remover without disturbing the coat already
there.

<TEXT>
   ``The New Grove Dictionary of American Music'' has in its four
volumes a number of entries on jazz. But for its ``The New Grove
Dictionary of Jazz,'' the British company didn't just reprint those
entries and add others; it hired an American jazz musicologist and
saxophonist, 38-year-old Barry Kernfeld, as editor and started
fresh. As a matter of fact, the jazz dictionary was Kernfeld's idea.
   As a performer, Kernfeld says: ``I was never better than a good
local professional. I wouldn't take my horn out of the case in New
York City.'' Since marathon work on the dictionary began four years
ago, he hasn't taken his horn out of the case anyplace.
   An adviser on Kernfeld's Cornell University Ph.D. dissertation _
on improvisation in Miles Davis' 1958-59 sextet, which included
John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley _ suggested to Grove that
Kernfeld be hired to write about jazz for ``The Dictionary of
American Music.'' He wrote about 60 articles. Then he thought there
should be a Grove dictionary concentrating on jazz.
   ``It was a daunting, terrifying idea,'' he says. ``I didn't
mention it to anyone but my friends for the next two years. I was
teaching history of jazz part-time at Cornell and playing sax in a
jazz quartet.''
   Then Sally, his wife since 1981, got an assistant professorship
at Penn State in February 1984. Secure that one of them had a
full-time job, Kernfeld sent Grove a proposal for a jazz dictionary
in March. In April, he was hired and started planning. ``By the end
of the year we were in full swing,'' he says.
   One approach, new for jazz, Kernfeld says, ``is the way in which
we write about instruments. It is traditional in jazz to talk about
instruments by naming people. `Sol Yaged plays like Benny Goodman.'
You'd find that comment under `Yaged' but not under `clarinet' in
Grove.'' In instrument entries, Kernfeld says, ``What we've tried
to do is talk about the instrument and how it's used in jazz rather
than naming instrumentalists.
   ``There are catalogs of festivals, libraries and nightclubs.
There are reading lists and a full bibliography at the end. Big
theoretical articles are also a Grove idea.'' An 11-page discussion
of jazz in movies is found under `films.' There's a 9-page article
on jazz improvisation. ``That one I wrote,'' Kernfeld says. ``I
wrote several hundred.''
   There are, of course, entries for individuals. ``Branford
Marsalis had emerged as a major figure in time for us,'' Kernfeld
says. ``By the time Diane Schuur hit, we were past commissioning
articles. Most of our commissioning was done by 1986.''
   When asked how individuals were chosen, Kernfeld says: ``We
tried to put in people who had a lasting association with jazz, and
musicians of international renown who recorded regularly as
soloists. It is flexible. It is music, not science.''
   An exception, Kernfeld says, ``is sidemen who played with a
series of distinguished bands or one distinguished band for a
career, but were not soloists. For instance, Freddie Green is
listed. He drove the Basie rhythm section with the fluidity of his
strumming on the guitar. It really doesn't matter if he ever played
a solo in his life. He is tremendously important for defining one
aspect of the swing style.''
   About 10 percent of the articles are taken from the American
music dictionary, often with extensive revision.
   Kernfeld says: ``Jazz record labels turned out to be one of the
hardest things to get information on. Detailed coverage is
available to World War II. A lot of labels have disappeared. We
didn't know where to look.
   ``There's a discussion of facsimile reissues, which have come in
in this decade, with personnel lists, original liner notes and
photos. That's very important in jazz. One of my private theories
about why cassettes never caught on in jazz the way they have in
other genres is that the packaging of jazz takes on a greater
importance than it might elsewhere.''

<TEXT>UNDATED: might elsewhere.''    Kernfeld now lives in Oxford, England,
because his wife won a two-year fellowship for North American Ph.D. women
under 35. She studies 19th-century American agriculture, especially dairying,
about which Oxford has much material.    Wanting to be a performer, San
Francisco-born Kernfeld went to the University of California at Davis.
``I discovered to my surprise I really liked looking at music carefully
and seriously, and that I had some gift for writing about it.'' Entering
graduate school at Cornell, Kernfeld surprised himself again. ``I thought
I'd work on Berlioz and ended up working on Miles Davis, to my great pleasure.''
   Asked his personal favorite, Kernfeld says: ``There are things I love
from all parts of jazz. Coltrane is my favorite.''    Editing the dictionary
included ``a brutal eight months of proofreading,'' he says. ``Fortunately,
I hadn't thought about that when I started.''    But mostly, he says,
``It was wonderful. It was a four-year learning experience. It was like
getting to go to school again and getting to study this stuff in entirely
different ways.    ``It put me on the alert for strange and fun things
that I otherwise might not have paid attention to, except that I was trying
to define things for the dictionary. There's an article on `honk.' I found
a wonderful Frank Foster and Frank Wess example of honking on the tenor
sax. I made a two-bar musical example of it.''

<BYLINE>New from Leica</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Surprise _ Leica, the ``Cadillac'' of cameras, has entered the
point-and-shoot market.
   The Leica R reflex and M rangefinder cameras now have an
autofocus and auto-exposure sibling. The new camera, called the
AF-C1, has a suggested retail price of $698 _ less than the cost of
a typical Leica lens. (Now you know why Leica is called the
``Cadillac'' of cameras.)
   The AF-C1 is a dual-lens system with both 40mm f2.0 and 80mm
f5.6 capability. The autofocus system projects five independent
infrared beams so that it can focus on a subject that is not in the
center of the viewfinder. The shutter release can actuate a focus
lock for out-of-center subjects. The camera focuses from 28 inches
to infinity in less than a second.
   The auto-exposure system uses center-weighted integral
measurements with automatic correction in cases of high contrast.
It has DX coding that sets film speeds from ASA 50 to 3200. With
non-coded film, the camera exposes for ASA 100.
   Coupled to the exposure system is a built-in flash that operates
automatically in low light, when contrasts are extreme, and in
back-lighted situations. When the lens is switched from wide-angle
to tele, the flash angle is changed accordingly and the distance of
the flash reflector from the optical axis is altered to reduce the
possibility of red-eye. The flash recycles in two seconds and can
be operated manually.
   The viewfinder shows the autofocus frame and parallax indicators
for close-ups. A green light in the finder indicates that there is
adequate available light. A flash symbol appears when the flash has
cut in, and a red dot shows that it is not yet fully charged.
Another symbol warns the user that the subject is too close.
   The AF-C1 features autoloading to the first frame, a self-timer
and automatic rewind. You can also power-rewind midway through a
roll of film. A lithium battery powers the camera.
   The new camera should become available at Leica dealers in June.

   What did you plant, or plan to plant, in your garden this year?
Did you include many of the items that are popular among gardeners,
seed buyers and other sources?
   David Phillips, of Park Seed Co. (Greenwood, SC 29647), reports
that perennials are much in favor; so are cut flowers, everlasting
dry arrangements, drying potpourri and wreaths.
   Selling well, he added, are marigolds, zinnias, impatiens,
Achilles Debutante, gomphrena, echiveria globosa, and herbs that
are used in place of salt to flavor food, providing more natural
flavoring.
   Colored vegetables also are popular, including purple peppers
and radishes, yellow stuffing tomatoes, orange bush squash, Honey
Red seedless watermelon, and yellow ornamental edibles such as
Malabar spinach and hyacinth bean.
   Space-saving vegetables that will grow in containers are also in
demand.
   Vegetables that are big sellers at Park include Sweet Million,
Better Bush and Whopper tomatoes, County Fair and Whopper
cucumbers, Venture bean and Romano bush bean.
   New items from Petoseed (P.O. Box 4206, Saticoy, CA 93004)
include Jack of Hearts, hybrid triploid, seedless (or nearly so)
watermelon, early to midseason, 10-15 pounds; First Lady hybrid
tomato, medium-size fruit, 66 days from transplanting,
disease-resistant; Brigadier hybrid broccoli, midseason,
medium-green beads; Yellow Stuffer tomato, abundant producer,
resembles yellow pepper; and Clairmore hybrid squash, slightly
tapered 5- to 6-inch-long fruit, light green and speckled, early.
   From Van Bourgondien Bros. (P.O. Box A, Babylon, NY 11701):
Mignon dahlia Sweetheart, daisylike flowers, 12-15 inches tall,
bloom all summer; Japanese anemones, large, cup-shaped flowers,
purple-red, white and pink, flowers 2{ inches wide, plants 2{ feet
tall, bloom September to fall; and Red Cap primula, 15-18 inches
tall, with clusters of lilac-pink flowers, likes shade or sun, good
for borders and rock gardens.
   Burpee (Warminster, PA 18974) offers, among others,
international vegetables that are ``favorites in their native lands
but little-known in the United States.'' They include the Haricot
Vert, or filet bean from France; asparagus pole bean with long pods
from Southwest Asia, and well-known in Europe; broccoli Romanesco,
widely grown in Italy; and Whitloof (French or Belgian) endive.
   Other Burpee introductions include butterhead lettuce from
France, Japanese mustard green, bush shell beans from the
Caribbean, and cabbage from Alsace-Lorraine.
   Newcomers from Stokes Seeds (Buffalo, NY 14240) include Super
Sweet Banana pepper by Hungarian plant breeder Istvan Turi;
seedless Jack of Hearts watermelon; Summerset VF beefsteak tomato,
very early; Centron cabbage; Precocious sweet corn, early maturing;
Can-Am Express, a cross of a Western cantaloupe and an Eastern
muskmelon; and two ``baby'' vegetables _ Bush Baby cucumber
(pickling gherkins) and Baby Bell miniature eggplant.

   Cornell University's New York State Agricultural Experiment
Station at Geneva has introduced a fall-fruiting raspberry called
Ruby, which is a cross between widely grown Heritage and Titan.
Heritage contributed the fall-fruiting characteristics, and Titan
the large size.
   John C. Sanford said that Ruby averages ``half again as large as
Heritage,'' which was introduced by the Geneva Station in 1969.
Titan also came from Geneva, three years ago.
   According to Sanford, Ruby needs special growing care.

   A recent column featured new stamps commemorating the 200th
anniversary of the ``Mutiny on the Bounty'' issued by the Isle of
Man in the Irish Sea.
   Once again, an island off the English coast is making stamp
news. This time, it's the English Channel Bailiwick of Guernsey,
which is paying a philatelic tribute to the 50th anniversary of
both the Guernsey Airport and the affiliation of the 201st Squadron
of the Royal Air Force with the States of Guernsey.
   There are six stamps in the set, each featuring a different RAF
plane associated with Guernsey during the past half-century. The
stamps are issued in three pairs, each pair in a different
denomination.
   One of the pair of 12-pence stamps depicts a Southampton
seaplane on the water, while the other shows a DeHaviland 86
Express being loaded with mail at the Guernsey Airport.
   There is an 18-pence that features a Sunderland aircraft flying
on the ocean's surface, and another 18-pence that bears a
DeHaviland 89 Rapide on the airport Tarmac.
   One of the 35-pence issues illustrates a Shackleton plane flying
high above the Channel, while the other pictures a British
Aerospace 146 at the airport.
   Each stamp has the inscription ``50th Anniversary Guernsey
Airport'' at the bottom and the Queen Elizabeth II vignette in the
upper right. The stamps were designed by Neil Foggo, a former
member of the 201st RAF Squadron of Guernsey.

   Another tribute to flight is found in the latest set of four
airmail regular definitives of the Marshall Islands, former
U.S.-administered Trust Territory in the Pacific.
   The 12-cent (for use on mail to the outer islands) depicts a
Dornier DO228 plane used by the airlines of the Marshalls. The
36-cent shows the Boeing 737 jet flown by Air Nauru in its flights
to the Marshalls. The 39-cent features the H.S. 748 plane, also
commonly used by local airlines. The 45-cent illustrates a Boeing
727 jet of Continental Airlines, which flies to the Marshalls
regularly.

   From Turkey comes a set of four new stamps that highlight
important artifacts from its rich historical past. All four
artifacts are on display at Turkey's Museum of Anatolian
Civilization, in Ankara.
   The 150-lira stamp features a baked clay image of ``Seated
Goddess With Child,'' found in Hacilar. The piece dates back to 600
B.C., when the goddess was worshipped as a symbol of fertility.
   The 300-lira depicts a lead figurine found in Alisa from the
Assyrian trading colonies in the 19th century B.C. It is said to
represent a pagan god and goddess.
   The 600-lira shows a vase-shaped human figure baked in clay and
measuring just 11 inches high. It is also thought to be from the
Assyrian period.
   The 1,000-lira illustrates an ivory mountain god from the 14th
century B.C. The piece is considered one of the finest examples of
Hittite art.

<TEXT>HEAD: `The Cos' writes about love    ___    LOVE &amp; MARRIAGE. By
Bill Cosby. Doubleday. 188 Pages. $16.95.    Once again, Bill Cosby is
dispensing advice and, as always, he does so with great warmth and wit.
   Cosby, whose antics are familiar to millions thanks to television,
deals with ``Love &amp; Marriage'' this time out. Or, as he puts it: ``In this
book, I will share with you my lifelong study of women and love. I cannot,
however, claim to have gotten an `A' myself in this course. ... love 
you don't want to knock the girl down, you want to bowl her over. Suddenly,
you lose interest in scarring her knees and turn your attention to making
an impact on her heart.''    But, try as he might, Cosby had little luck
impacting hearts. ``I generally loved from afar'' or, as a friend told
him when Cosby was on his way to pick up a beautiful girl to take to a
party: ``I still don't see her going with you. Maybe she's gonna become
a nun and has to do some kinda suffering.''    And so it went, until he
met Camille, the woman he married. But not without trepidation: ``Women,
I decided, are not just men who can have babies. How would I be able to
spend a lifetime with such aliens?''    And, after marriage, with a continuing
sense of wonder: ``Camille and I do have many things in common besides
our both being afraid of the children; but our maddening traits are also
there. For two people in a marriage to live together day after day is unquestionably
the one miracle the Vatican has overlooked.''    A most pleasant book.

<TEXT>HEAD: Small book packs a big wallop    ___    WORDSTRUCK: A Memoir.
By Robert MacNeil. Viking. 230 Pages. $18.95.    ``Wordstruck,'' by Robert
MacNeil, is an endearing book that traces his love of literature and language
as a young man in Nova Scotia up through his early years as a Canadian
broadcaster.    His formative years were richly seasoned by his parents'
love of books. Dramatic readings of the classics by his mother left an
indelible appreciation for the spoken word, and his father's library of
nautical books was a constant source of entertainment for the young MacNeil.
   MacNeil gives his readers a glimpse of innocent times, unfortunately
long gone. While his dad was out to sea for months at a time during the
war, his mother kept up a brave front for the children at home. His narratives
of childhood experiences illustrate a world quite different from today's
media-oriented society.    Radio was a new and innovative way for the
world to communicate and inform, and MacNeil describes his fascination
with the ``sounds from across the sea'' with the same enthusiasm as a child
at his first circus. Readers will find his explanations on the origins
of commonly used phrases and colloquialisms most interesting, and his explanation
of the game of cricket is very amusing.    Perhaps the most poignant passage
in this book is one that tells his thoughts on his father's ``legacy''
after his death: ``To his three sons he bequeathed his accomplishments
and the things he did not do. It is significant how much of our lives we
have spent doing just those things, balancing his account with life. Thus
in his fantasies he moves us still. There was plenty of him to go around.''
   ``Wordstruck'' is a small book that packs a big punch. It is a wonderful,
appealing chronicle of one man's boyhood recollections of life and family,
and it leaves the reader with a warm feeling for the past, and hope for
the future of our language and culture.    Cecilia McNally    Associated

<TEXT>HEAD: Spenser and the point-shaver    ___    PLAYMATES. By Robert
B. Parker. Putnam. 222 Pages. $17.95.    Robert B. Parker is probably
the smoothest writer creating what are termed ``mysteries.'' His prose
flows without raising its voice, giving the reader information, two couples
in love, sympathy with certain characters, witty repartee, danger.   
Would that textbooks entered the mind and stayed in the memory as easily
as ``Playmates,'' which is set on a college campus.    ``Playmates,''
however, isn't a mystery. Spenser, the Boston private eye, is a modern-day
knight, out to right wrongs. Often, in his case, that doesn't mean solving
a puzzle and bringing an offender to a cop.    Spenser is hired by a college
to track a rumor that somebody on its basketball team is shaving points.
He spots it, easily, by watching game videos with a former player and coach.
   Now comes Spenser's real work. The point-shaver is the best college
basketball player in the country, and one who grew up in New York poverty.
He's a college senior who can't read because teachers didn't care.   
Spenser wants the crooks who set up the point-shaving to do time without
ruining the player's future in pro ball. He wants the player to absorb
a lesson from this and he wants him to learn to read. Spenser is aware
the crooks' easiest option is to kill whomever knows about the scam. 
  Not everybody survives. But the player does, with the help of a good
woman, and Spenser does, with the help of his own good woman and lethal
sidekick, Hawk.    Mary Campbell    Associated Press

   In the world of the personal computer, the fountain of youth is
limited even if you have unlimited funds.
   It's limited because there comes a point where buying add-ons to
increase the vigor of an aging PC becomes a losing proposition.
However, for most of us, spending up to $1,000 to rejuvenate the
machine we have is smarter than spending $1,500 and up (sometimes
way up) to get a new one.
   The June issue of COMPUTE! magazine has an article that outlines
ways to put current-level power into your MS-DOS, Macintosh or
Commodore Amiga. In general, the idea is to expand your machine in
the areas critical to your main use.
   If your computer is used primarily to play games, for example,
you might want to expand the memory to accommodate today's
RAM-hungry simulations, or boost the graphics display with a card
that handles more monitor resolution (and a monitor to match).
   Or you might want to expand storage with a hard disk, or boost
the power of your output by upgrading to an ink-jet printer. If
video is your thing and you have an Amiga, you might want to
purchase a genlock, a widget that mixes live video and Amiga
graphics for taping on a VCR.
   Even if your machine isn't among those mentioned, you should
consider trying to boost performance before shopping for a new box.
Apple II machines, for example, while fairly old in the computing
scheme of things, are very expandable. And in the MS-DOS world,
upgrading the 8088 processor in your PC to an Intel 80286 (the kind
used in the PC AT) can bring you improved number-crunching and
graphic performance at a fraction of the cost and bother of a new
machine.
   Read the article for details, including manufacturers and
prices, but remember not to get carried away: a souped-up older PC
that costs more than two-thirds above the original purchase price
should make you wonder if patience (and a bit of saving) wouldn't
be the best bet.

   Just about the time that the Cold War seems to be cooling down
among the superpowers, it's heating up in the software simulation
arena, where every other release seems to detail an American-Soviet
confrontation. MicroProse International has released Red Storm
Rising for the IBM PC. If you want to fight your war as a submarine
commander, this one can't be missed. It requires an IBM PC or
compatible with at least 384,000 characters of memory, a color or
monochrome graphics adapter, a 5.25-inch disk drive, $54.95 _ and
nerves of steel.
   The simulation is based on the best-selling novel by Tom Clancy,
who wrote a foreword for the 100-page operations manual. Kevin, 14
and the CompuBug house expert on games that go Boom!, was impressed:
   ``This simulation keeps up with MicroProse's high standards for
detail, authenticity and realism.... The graphics are excellent. I
reviewed it in Tandy 1000 graphics (16 colors). I especially
recommend the WW III simulation. In this, you follow a series of
battles in the Norwegian Sea theater. One of your losses may result
in a major Warsaw Pact offensive, changing the view of all of
Europe. As you play, for example, if the Warsaw Pact is taking the
offensive, West Germany slowly fills in red, making you feel you
should start winning your battles.
   ``To play the WW III simulation, you need at least 90 minutes.
You can save the game between battles, but only one battle at a
time makes it little fun. I would recommend this game to anyone 13
years or older, because you can't appreciate it without some
knowledge of NATO and Warsaw Pact differences. I would also
recommend a hard drive, although not required.''

<HEAD>HEAD: A Nakashima retrospective at American Craft Museum</HEAD>
<NOTE>By BARBARA MAYER</NOTE>
<NOTE>AP Newsfeatures</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The day after their house burned to the ground in Princeton,
N.J., Evelyn and Arthur Krosnick drove to George Nakashima's studio
in New Hope, Pa. There, they asked the 84-year-old American
craftsman to replace all 110 pieces of his work that had been
destroyed.
   ``We might even come up with something better,'' said Nakashima,
one of the leading figures in American design and a pioneer among
contemporary furniture makers.
   Two pieces were spared destruction when a plumber's torch set
off the fire. Both were on loan to the American Craft Museum in New
York City for an exhibition of Nakashima's work since 1945. The
exhibit runs through Aug. 13.
   The Krosnicks' collection of Nakashima furniture spans 30 years,
and their house had been designed to accommodate it. They tracked
down the blueprints and vow to rebuild.
   Devotion to Nakashima is a trait the Krosnicks share with a
large group of admirers that includes Happy Rockefeller, whose
Tarrytown N.Y. home has 220 examples of Nakashima's furniture.
   ``We recognize George Nakashima as a national treasure. I think
we have become better people because of his influence,'' says
Evelyn Krosnick.
   Even those who don't own his furniture may have felt his
influence, according to Derek E. Ostergard, curator of the
exhibition and author of the book, ``George Nakashima: Full
Circle'' (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, $40).
   Nakashima influenced a generation of young college-educated
Americans to work with their hands.
   His deceptively simple furniture combines magnificent wood, an
oil finish that emphasizes the wood grain, fine workmanship and a
mix of contemporary and traditional forms.
   ``These things are so powerful, so sensual, people can hardly
keep from touching them,'' says Ostergard. ``I don't know of work
like this elsewhere.''
   No two pieces are alike, yet many _ especially the tables _
feature a free-form edge which Ostergard defines as the outer
profile of a tree trunk just beneath the bark.
   Nakashima, an American of Japanese descent who was interned in
an Idaho relocation camp in 1942-43, has written extensively about
how important his Japanese roots are to him.
   Born in Spokane, Wash., and educated at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, he worked as an architect in Japan before learning
furniture-making from a Japanese woodworker.
   Yet, Ostergard says Nakashima's design philosophy is inspired by
the arts and crafts movement, a western invention, and his
furniture is based on European joinery and forms such as the
Windsor chair. Most Japanese furniture is built in and lacquered.
Nakashima, who does not make built-ins, nearly always works with
grained wood.
   During his internment, Nakashima teamed up with a
Japanese-trained carpenter. ``I learned a great deal from him,'' he
says.
   After the war, Nakashima set up shop in New Hope and collectors
began beating a path to his door. Today, the shop is open only a
few hours on Saturday afternoons. Browsers may find a small stool
or side table for $200 or so. But most work is made to order and a
large dining table, for example, might cost $20,000.
   The Krosnicks discovered his work there in the 1950s. They
ascribe to his belief that the best way to acquire furniture is
``to buy something wonderful and keep it for your whole life and
then pass it on to your children. We feel permanence that way.''
   Nakashima's workshop, with 10 employees, is actually a small
factory with an annual output of as many as 1,000 pieces. It took
less than two years to produce the 220 items for the Rockefeller
house.
   Helping Nakashima run the company are his daughter, Mirra
Nakashima-Yarnall, an architect and second in command; his wife,
Marion, and son, Kevin.
   Nakashima's pieces are made of solid wood, not veneer. He
regrets having to fell fine trees; even the title of his book is
``The Soul of a Tree.'' But, says he, ``If we don't get it, someone
else will. We feel we can give the tree a second life.''

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweden will lower its highway speed
limit to 55 mph (90 kilometers) this summer in an effort to save
lives and reduce pollution from auto emissions.
   But police doubt it will work. They say it's hard enough to
enforce the current 68 mph limit. And Automobile Association
officials call the measure too drastic.
   The new limit will be in effect June 22-Aug. 20, when traffic
usually increases by about 30 percent.
   The environment has been a concern in Swedish politics for years
and was a key issue in last fall's election. The long-entrenched
Social Democrats were returned to power, but the Environment Party
won enough votes to become the first new party in parliament in
more than 60 years.
   Swedish highways join those of Norway and Ireland as the slowest
in Europe. West Germany has no top limit on its autobahns, and most
other European countries have a 62 to 74 mph limit.
   Authorities argue that the lower limit will cut emissions of
nitrogen oxides by 35 to 40 percent. Nitrogen oxides cause acid
rain.
   Tomas Nilson of the Automobile Association, which has 200,000
members, says car emissions ``have extremely marginal effects'' on
the environment.
   He says the association has ``a certain understanding'' for the
decision to lower speed limits if it can save lives, ``but it is
wrong to lower speeds everywhere.''
   The government's decision attempts to reverse a trend of the
last several years of faster driving on Swedish roads even though
speed limits were not increased. Police blame speeding on more
powerful cars and drivers under more stress in their daily lives.
   Traffic police have had little success combating speeding even
though they deployed more motorcycle cops, helicopters, radar and
cars equipped with speed-recording video cameras.
   The government's Traffic Council Agency said in a report that,
with the slower speeds this summer, between 10 and 20 lives could
be saved and 100 to 200 fewer people would be injured.
   In recent months, road deaths have increased sharply, especially
on highways.
   ``The cars are faster and better,'' says police inspector Rune
Pelli, ``but it is the same old human being who is driving.''

   ON THE A9 MOTORWAY, Netherlands (AP) _ The young couple rented a
1936 Rolls Royce for their wedding day. When the fanbelt snapped,
it was the Road Service that got them to the church on time.
   The Road Service is the Netherlands' 24-hour repair service, and
its legendary mechanics in their yellow cars don't give up easily.
   ``I had a quick look through my supplies and I just happened to
have the right belt,'' said mechanic Ruud Lucken, recalling how he
got the Rolls rolling.
   Because the hapless couple's chauffeur was one of the 2.3
million members of the Road Service, the emergency call cost just
the price of the fanbelt.
   Not a towing operation, the Road Service is renowned for its
mechanics' expertise with almost any model among the 5.6 million
cars, trucks and buses that crowd this small nation's highway
system.
   Its 650 radio-dispatched vehicles deal with an average of 2,000
breakdowns a day, providing a mechanical safety net for motorists
in this cradle-to-grave welfare state.
   The Road Service began in 1946 with a handful of volunteers and
a fleet of seven Harley-Davidson Liberator motorcycles left behind
by World War II Allied forces.
   Although some motorcycles are still in use, most mechanics drive
compact cars carrying more than 880 pounds of power and hand tools,
fuel, water, lubricants and spare parts.
   Road Service vehicles patrol all major Dutch highways and, with
a toll-free telephone call, are usually at the scene of a breakdown
within minutes.
   Owned by the Royal Dutch Tourist Association, the Road Service
has an annual membership fee of $22.25. For that service, which can
include up to two hours of labor, members pay only for parts. Tips
are forbidden.
   Non-members can get help as well, but the price is on-the-spot
membership.
   To protect against abuse, mechanics limit their work to
emergency repairs designed to get the car back in motion.
   Mechanic Jan Brand tells of one call for a highway breakdown.
The motorist had apparently had the car towed there to take
advantage of the free service. The engine was cold, and the
motorist's policy only covered highway repairs.
   For a small annual surcharge, the Road Service provides repairs
anywhere, even in the owner's garage.
   The key to the Road Service's success is its mechanics, who are
``expected to know everything there is to know about every single
car,'' says Wim van Dink, chief of the training program.
   Mechanics spend 2{ years learning how to repair ``everything
from a motorcycle to the heaviest type of truck,'' as well as
firefighting and first aid techniques, Van Dijk says.
   ``Occasionally, you have to face the fact that there's something
wrong with a car that you can't fix,'' said Brand, as he cruised
this Amsterdam-area highway on the lookout for car trouble.
   ``But no car's getting towed away,'' he said, ``unless I know at
least what's wrong with it.''
   The Road Service mechanics' load is lightened considerably by
Dutch government regulations requiring mechanical tests for all
vehicles over three years old.
   ``Nowadays, they don't make any more really bad cars,'' says
Brand. ``Of course some are more breakdown-prone than others.''

   When you go on vacation, make sure your
house is well protected.
   Even if you have a monitored electronic security system, have a
neighbor collect newspapers and mail. Put outdoor lights and at
least one indoor light on automatic timers. Let your friends know
when you are leaving and when you will return. Consider hiring a
house-sitter for extended absences.
   Peter A. Michel of Brink's Home Security Inc. offers these other
suggestions for year-round protection:
   Join a crime-watch program in your neighborhood.
   Leave your outside lights on at night. If your neighborhood is
dimly lit, lobby for better community lighting or install flood
lights on your home.
   Keep hedges nextrimmed to no higher than the
window sill to make burglars more visible.
   When you leave the house, leave tt to your house he stereo or television

   No matter how well planned, family vacations are
never perfect. But there are some things you can do to ease the
stress of traveling with children.
   To hent
pieces.
   ``Taking the right accessories along is easier when you plan
your wardrobe and then work your plan,'' says Terrymayer, a New
York fashion consultant and jewelry designer.
   Basics, she says, can be made to fit the occasion with the
proper shoes, belt, handbag and jewelry, scarf or hat.
   ``A diary of what you have worn with your favorite separates or
suits makes sense,'' she says. ``If you know what you have, you can
plan what you need.''
   One basic that is coming around again is the shirtwaist dress.
   ``Someone once said it has a thousand and one ways of looking,''
Terrymayer says. ``It is like adding the dressing to a salad to
give it its name.''
   The shirtwaist, of course, can be of any one of a multitude of
fabrics. It can be straight from the shoulder to the shirttail hem,
to be cinched by a belt or tie or left loose. Or it can have a
defined waistline with one of several skirt styles _ pleated,
gathered, flared, straight.
   As for accessories, says Terrymayer, ``this is the year of the
bangle bracelet. For fashion impact, wear several at once, perhaps
even six. It is the time of the charm bracelet, which gives you the
chance to show your major interests, on your arm. In the summer,
the sea and its charms look so with-it.
   ``It is wise to know that it is not the value of the accessory
that counts, but the way you feel about it, for you to give it its
display.
   ``What you wear takes on your personality.''
   When traveling this summer, says Terrymayer, take along some
lightweight colorful earrings, some bangles and perhaps some chains
for your neck.``Take jewelry you won't have to worry about,'' she
says.``Pack it in a small silk square and tie it hobo fashion.''
   And remember that whatever you choose to take, ``its beauty is
in the eye of the beholder, and its role is to accent you.''

   Whether you're scanning the horizon from a
cruise ship, going on a big-game photo shoot in Africa, backpacking
in a state park or birding from your back deck, binoculars are
standard equipment.
   Depending on quality, they range in price from about $50 to more
than $900. But, says Mark Abrams of Clairmont-Nichols Optics in New
York, ``only 15 percent of people who come in for binoculars know
what type of glasses they should buy to fit their needs.''
   Before buying, says Bob Meichsner of Swarovski Optik, you should
decide their primary use and bone up on binocular-talk. Know
especially the meaning of the two numbers the dealer will refer to,
ie., 7x42. The first number is the magnification, the ``x'' is
shorthand for ``power'' and the second number is the objective lens
diameter.
   So 7x means the binoculars will make objects look seven times
bigger than they really are. The 42 is the diameter in millimeters
of each of the front lenses, called objective lenses. The wider the
objective lens, the more light and thus a better image.
   A good general-purpose pair of binoculars can be selected from
7x42, 7x50 or 8x30 models.

   Tax Tips for the Disorganized:
   As you think back on the pain associated with preparing your
1988 tax return, consider how much of it was self-inflicted because
of your failure to keep decent files last year. Jeffrey Mayer, a
Chicago consultant, thinks about such things and makes his living _
at $250 an hour _ telling clients how to efficiently manage their
time and their paperwork.
   His advice for tax records? Buy a box of file folders, the kind
with staggered tabs. Rather than try to think of all the tax
categories for which you need separate files, just label the files
A to Z. Beginning today, file all paid bills, receipts and other
documents that might have a tax consequence alphabetically.
   It's up to you whether to file your Visa bills under ``V,'' by
the name of the issuing bank or under ``C'' for credit. Just decide
and stick with it. Label separate files for your investments: One
for mutual funds, one for brokerage accounts and so on.
   The point is to set up the files and get in the habit of feeding
them each month as the paperwork rolls in. Mayer suggests you take
a couple of hours now to sort through the piles of unorganized
papers that have already built up this year.
   The payoff? ``I was able to prepare everything for my accountant
in less than two hours,'' he says. Mayer says organization comes in
handy if the IRS comes calling. He should know, since he's
undergoing an IRS audit.
   Mayer also thinks a good filing system is an antidote to tax
anxiety. ``Everyone waits until the last minute to get anything
done, and they put a lot of pressure on themselves,'' he says. ``If
people have everything organized, they can get the stuff together
in an hour and get it to their accountant or do it themselves and
be finished with it.''

   Squeezing Dependents:
   Congress has given parents another reason to suggest that grown
children move out of the house. Until this year, if a child was a
full-time student for at least five months of the year, Mom and Dad
could claim a dependency exemption as long as they provided more
than half of the child's support. It didn't matter how much Junior
made.

   Now, however, the income test that applies to everyone else also
covers full-time students over age 23. If your son or daughter age
24 or older has gross income of $2,000 or more, you can't claim him
or her as a dependent, regardless of how much support you provide.
That means no $2,000 write-off for you.
   It's not bad news for the whole family, though. Since you can't
claim the exemption, your child can claim a personal exemption on
his or her return.

   Tax Break Lost:
   Congress has made a ``correction'' to the tax law that could
prove costly if you take a hefty lump-sum distribution from a
company retirement plan.
   Before 1987, retirees receiving such payouts could use a special
tax-saving formula called 10-year averaging to figure the tax bill.
Congress replaced that with a less generous five-year averaging
formula. (If you were born on or before Jan. 1, 1936, you can still
choose 10-year averaging.)
   Here's how five-year averaging works. Rather than tax your
entire lump-sum distribution in your top tax bracket _ probably 28
percent or 33 percent _ you find how much a single person would owe
on a fifth of the payout if that was his or her only income, then
multiply that tax by five. The benefit is that five times the
normal amount is taxed in the 15 percent bracket rather than at 28
percent. That can save more than $12,000 in some cases.
   That saving is still possible on distributions up to $224,500.
For bigger amounts, however, the benefit is gradually phased out
until five-year averaging offers no advantage for payouts over
$465,650.
   The tax break disappears because Congress has now decided the 5
percent surcharge that creates the 33 percent bracket should also
apply to five-year averaging. If it wipes out the tax advantage for
you, consider 10-year averaging if your age makes you eligible, or
take a hard look at an IRA rollover, advises Changing Times
magazine.
   Putting the payout in an IRA within 60 days of receiving the
money puts off the tax bill until you withdraw the funds from the
IRA. If you could spread the withdrawals over several years, a
rollover might be better for you even if the size of your
distribution means you're not hurt by the change.

<HEAD>HEAD: Helping Your Elderly Parents</HEAD>
<NOTE>By CHANGING TIMES</NOTE>
<NOTE>The Kiplinger Magazine</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   As life expectancies lengthen and the number of people over 85
doubles by the year 2000, more and more 40- and 50-year-olds are
going to be called upon to help their parents manage and protect
their assets.
   Changing Times magazine advises you to learn the ``Medicaid
shuffle'' and other maneuvers so you'll be prepared should your
parents become unable to take care of themselves.
   With nursing home costs averaging $22,000 a year, about half the
patients who foot the bill see their assets wiped out, according to
the Health Insurance Association of America.
   Help may be available through Medicaid, the medical assistance
program funded by federal and state governments. But to be
eligible, an applicant must be virtually impoverished, with cash
and other nonexempt assets of as little as $2,000 for an individual
and $3,000 for a couple in some states. One big exception: As long
as one of your parents is living at home, he or she can't be forced
to sell it to pay for the other's nursing home care. Nearly all
other assets are fair game, however.
   Last year's Medicare legislation introduced a new wrinkle. In
the past a spouse couldn't be forced to pay for more than a month
of care of an institutionalized spouse applying for Medicaid.
Starting this year, however, the spouse at home can be required to
dip into his or her assets.
   Here's how it works: Medicaid totals up the nonexempt assets of
both husband and wife and each is given credit for half. The
spouse, the wife, say, who stays at home can keep assets from her
half worth up to $60,000. Anything over that is earmarked by
Medicaid to pay for her husband's care. If the half comes to less
than $12,000, she gets enough of the total assets to reach the
$12,000 minimum, if possible. The law also sets a ceiling, usually
$1,500, and a floor, currently about $800, on her monthly income.
   How can your parents protect their property? Their options are
limited, says Changing Times magazine. Setting up a trust won't
work since transferred assets will be figured into the ability to
pay for a parent's care if the trustee has discretion to use the
trust's income or principal for the parent's benefit. Such a trust
is called a Medicaid qualifying trust.
   Your parents might be tempted to try an end run around the rules
by giving their assets to you or selling them to you at a bargain
price. But that tactic won't elude Uncle Sam, either. Under the new
Medicaid rules, a parent can be ineligible for benefits for up to
30 months following a transfer of property for less than fair
market value to anyone other than a spouse.
   Of course, your parents can outflank the government by
transferring their property more than 30 months before one of them
will be applying for Medicaid. However, that assumes they can
estimate when they might need assistance, or have pockets deep
enough to get through the waiting period.

   Your best strategy, advises attorney Myron Greenberg of
Larkspur, Calif., is to look for a good long-term-care insurance
policy that pays for four years of nursing home care. If your
parent is still in the nursing home after 1{ years, assets can be
transferred to you or to someone else. The 30 months remaining on
the policy will help cover the Medicaid waiting period.
   If you contribute to your parent's financial support, you may
get your earthly reward in the form of tax breaks.
   _ Dependency exemption: You will be able to claim your parent as
a dependent if all of the following conditions apply: You
contribute more than half of his or her support, your parent does
not file a joint return, and he or she has gross income of less
than $2,000 a year. If you and other siblings together provide more
than half the support, any one of you (but only one of you) who
supplies more than 10 percent can claim the exemption.
   _ Dependent-care tax credit: If your elderly parent lives with
you and you have to hire someone to care for him or her while you
work, you can get an income tax credit of as much as $720 to offset
up to $2,400 in expenses for one dependent and as much as $1,440 to
offset up to $4,800 for two or more.
   _ Dependent-care reimbursement: If your employer offers such a
plan, you can pay for up to $5,000 a year in dependent-care
expenses in pretax dollars. It works like this: You estimate your
expenses for the coming year. That amount is deducted from your
salary and you don't pay taxes on it. You then report your
dependent-care expenses to your employer periodically and get
reimbursed from the money that has been set aside. One potential
catch: If any money remains in the account at the end of the year,
you lose it.
   _ Medical-care deduction: If your parent is your dependent, or
would be except that he or she files a joint return or has gross
income of more than $2,000, you can deduct medical expenses you pay
on your parent's behalf.
   However, medical expenses are deductible only to the extent they
exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. If it's easier for
your parents to meet that threshold than it is for you, you might
consider giving them the money to pay their own medical bills so
they can take the deduction. But be aware that if it exceeds
$10,000 a year, you will be making a taxable gift.
   When you pay the money directly to a health care provider, such
as a nursing home, there's an unlimited exclusion from the gift tax
as long as the contribution is not reimbursed. This would also
avoid transferring assets to your parents that might be depleted by
Medicaid qualifying rules.
   _ Irrevocable trusts: If you have assets to spare, you can use
some of them to set up an irrevocable trust that will provide
income to your parents during their lifetimes or for a fixed
period. You'll be contributing to their care with before-tax
dollars. And since you have given up control of the assets, you
won't be taxed on the income _ your parents will. But those tax
breaks don't come cheap: Neither you nor your spouse can get the
assets back, although the property can pass to your children at the
end of the trust.

<HEAD>HEAD: Getting Through the Financial Maze</HEAD>
<NOTE>By CHANGING TIMES</NOTE>
<NOTE>The Kiplinger Magazine</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Do you have a plan of action in case one or both of your elderly
parents cannot take care of themselves or their finances?
   Caring for your elderly parents can mean taking responsibility
for their financial health as well as their physical well-being. If
you find yourself in that position, you'll have to negotiate a
tricky legal and financial maze to determine, among other things,
who should control your parents' assets, how they should be used
and who, if anyone, will realize any tax benefits.
   Joint ownership of assets with right of survivorship is a
popular strategy for parents and children, but it is often not the
best one. Holding a small bank account or two jointly with your
parent makes sense if the amounts involved are relatively small.
Or, it can work when your parent's finances are fairly
straightforward _ if, for example, he or she doesn't own a home and
receives income solely from Social Security. And jointly held
property bypasses probate.
   As assets mount, however, so do the problems, warns Changing
Times magazine. If your father, for instance, makes you a joint
tenant, generally he makes a gift to you. That gift is subject to
the federal gift tax when half the value of the assets exceeds
$10,000, the annual exclusion from the gift tax. Depending on the
asset, you may owe income tax on half the income earned by the
property, even if your father keeps all of it for his own use.
   You control the assets subject to the joint tenancy, and you can
do whatever you want with them. Your father thus has no guarantee
you'll use them on his behalf. And when he dies, you have no legal
responsibility to share the assets with anyone else, regardless of
what your father may have wished.
   Two alternatives avoid those pitfalls: the durable power of
attorney and the revocable living trust.
   Durable Power of Attorney: This technique is so crucial that ``a
lawyer would be remiss in not suggesting that an older person have
a durable power as well as a will,'' says John Regan of the Hofstra
University School of Law, who has written extensively on tax and
estate planning for the elderly.
   Like a regular power of attorney, a durable power is an
inexpensive, easily executed document. It allows your father to
name you (or someone else) as his agent, and he can make the power
as narrow or as broad as he wishes. Unlike a regular power of
attorney, which ceases when the person granting it becomes mentally
incompetent, a durable power remains in effect.
   One catch: To create a valid power, a person has to be mentally
competent at the time he or she signs it. If your father already
suffers from Alzheimer's disease or some other mental illness, it
may be too late. You may have to ask the court to appoint a
guardian for your father and-or his property _ a procedure that's
expensive, degrading to the parent, and may require doctors and
family members to testify in open court.

<TEXT>
   So it's critical to plan in advance. But that too can raise a
thorny issue. A durable power takes effect as soon as it is signed,
which means you, as agent, have the power to manage the property
immediately. That may not sit well with a parent who is still fully
capable of running his or her own affairs. In that case, consider a
``springing'' durable power of attorney, if your parent lives in a
state that permits it. A springing durable power, though executed
now, springs to life in the future, normally when your parent
becomes mentally unable to handle things.
   Even if a springing durable power isn't permitted in your state,
your mother can leave a signed durable-power document with her
lawyer. Since you won't have proof in hand that you are the
authorized agent, you won't be able to do anything with her
property. Should your mother become mentally incompetent, the power
would be turned over to you. She can revoke a power of attorney at
any time while she is still mentally competent.
   All powers of attorney end automatically when the principal
dies. In a few states, durable powers have to be renewed
periodically.
   A durable power is becoming the cornerstone of all estate
planning for the elderly. But it does have one possible drawback:
Since your mother gives up control of her own affairs as soon as it
takes effect, you, as agent, may be able to do anything you want
with your mother's property during her lifetime.
   Revocable Living Trusts: If your mother prefers to retain more
control over her affairs, she might consider a revocable living
trust. Such a trust takes effect during the lifetime of the person
who sets it up, who can change or revoke it as long as he or she is
mentally competent. It gives the creator a great deal of control
during and after his or her lifetime. Usually your mother can
continue to manage her property by acting as her own trustee, with
another trustee standing by to take over if she becomes
incapacitated. So the trust, in effect, operates like a springing
durable power of attorney, says Changing Times magazine.
   Perhaps even more important from your parent's point of view,
trust language will spell out exactly how the trustee should use
the income and principal. If your mother doesn't want to transfer
assets to the trust right away, she can arrange for it to be done
later by the trustee or another agent using a durable power of
attorney. At your parent's death, a trust can distribute property
much like a will _ and the assets don't go through probate.
   Revocable living trusts have some drawbacks, however. In
exchange for retaining control of his or her assets, your parent
does not get the tax breaks of an irrevocable trust, which gives
assets away permanently. The creator of a revocable trust pays
income tax on its earnings, and at death the value of the assets is
included in his or her gross estate for federal estate-tax
purposes. Drafting a trust also costs more than drafting a power of
attorney. Lawyers' fees run $300 to $400 or more. You can figure on
an additional $500 to $2,500 a year if you choose a bank as
trustee.

<HEAD>1990 Chevrolet Lumina Joins Mid-size Competition</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a lot riding on the 1990 Chevrolet Lumina sedan.
   As Chevrolet's newest model _ and its largest front-drive car
ever _ the Lumina competes in the mid-size, family sedan market,
which accounts for a sizable 22 percent of total industry sales.
   As the replacement for the Chevrolet Celebrity, the Lumina will
hopefully live up to the Celebrity's record as America's
best-selling mid-size car for the past seven years combined. And as
the first sedan version of General Motors Corp.'s
multibillion-dollar GM-0 mid-sized cars, the Lumina is expected to
help the giant automaker recoup its investment.
   The test car _ a Lumina Euro sedan _ showed why growing families
would appreciate this vehicle. Seating in front and back was
respectable. Legroom in the rear was good with the front seats
moved up, and still adequate with the seats moved back a ways.
   The engine, a 3.1-liter V-6 that's standard with the Euro model,
was teamed with a four-speed automatic overdrive transmission. Fuel
economy was decent for this size of car powered by a V-6 engine, 19
miles-per-gallon in the city and 30 mpg on the highway. Chevrolet
attributes some of that performance to the car's aerodynamics.
   The Lumina sedan has a coefficient of drag of .32, which
indicates the ease with which the car travels through the air, and
is better than the Ford Taurus' CD of .33. But the engine works
well, too, as the Virginia State Trooper commented when he ticketed
me for going 84 mph on the interstate.
   Lumina's handling and suspension _ with some rear suspension
design borrowed from the Corvette _ just made the car feel stable
enough even at that high speed, unfortunately for me.
   During my travels, I could readily hear the engine's throaty
rumble, especially when I pressed the accelerator hard for quick
maneuvers. I also noted some road noise.
   The dashboard gauges had large numbers and letters and were easy
to read. Chevrolet designed the instrument cluster so it slanted
downward and forward behind the clear plastic cover to help prevent
glare.
   On the outside, the Lumina Euro sedan's styling, especially the
rounded back, reminded me somewhat of the Pontiac Bonneville.
   Compared with its predecessor the Celebrity, the Lumina is two
inches wider and offers 3.1 cubic feet of additional interior
space. Trunk volume is down from 16.2 cubic feet in the Celebrity
to 15.7 cubic feet in the Lumina. Still, the Lumina's trunk was
flat and spacious, though you must lift items up and over the rear
part of the car body.
   The Lumina started appearing in dealerships in the spring, and
Chevrolet says it's too early to tell how sales are going since the
majority so far have gone to fleet buyers, such as car rental
agencies.
   Chevrolet projects 280,000 sales of the Lumina sedan by the end
of the 1990 model, with another 70,000 sales of the Lumina coupe.
   The coupe will debut this fall, as will a minivan carrying the
Lumina name. But the timing for the Lumina sedan may not be the
best.
   The Ford Taurus, an imposing competitor, has become entrenched
as a popular mid-size buy since its introduction in the 1986 model
year and has a starting price of around $11,700, just below the
Lumina's $11,883.
   Chevrolet is quick to note that the Lumina offers some features
as standard equipment that are optional on the Taurus. One example
is the standard base-coat, clear-coat paint finish on the Lumina,
company officials said.
   But many auto analysts are predicting increasingly sluggish car
sales overall, saying the market is saturated. So Chevrolet is
spending heavily to push the Lumina sedan, including television ads
featuring Disney cartoon characters.
   The company says targeted buyers of the sedan are between 45 and
55 years of age. Eighty percent will be married, with 40 percent to
50 percent with children. Chevrolet says median household income
will be between $38,000 and $40,000 a year. Thirty-five percent
will be college graduates.
   Since the Lumina is a new model, there are no owner repair
records from Consumer Reports magazine.

<HEAD>Jane Wyatt Remembers `Father Knows Best' in Marathon Showing</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jane Wyatt came away from taping an
appearance for a special ``Father Knows Best'' marathon for
Father's Day surprised at just how good the sitcom was almost 30
years ago.
   ``We stopped filming in 1960,'' said Wyatt. ``It's hard to
believe. We saw bits and pieces of shows when we taped the special.
They were quite good. The show had substance. That's why it lasted
so long. Our shows were written to be entertaining, but the writers
had something to say.''
   Wyatt and the rest of the cast will appear during the seven-hour
``Father Knows Best'' marathon on the CBN Family Channel on Sunday,
Father's Day.
   In its last season of original episodes, 1959-60, ``Father Knows
Best'' ranked sixth in the Nielsen ratings. It has run on all three
networks. CBS first ran it in 1954, then NBC picked it up the
second year, then it returned to CBS until 1961-62. ABC ran the
series one last season.
   Robert Young starred as Jim Anderson. Wyatt was Margaret. The
children were Elinor Donahue as Betty, or ``Princess,'' Billy Gray
as James Jr., better known as ``Bud,'' and Lauren Chapin as Kathy,
``Kitten.''
   ``Father Knows Best'' was the quintessential wholesome family
sitcom, along with ``The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'' and
``The Life of Riley.''
   The show had begun in 1949 as a radio show with Young in the
lead role and June Whitley as Margaret. When it was made into a
television show, Wyatt was offered the role.
   ``I turned it down time after time,'' she recalled. ``I said I
didn't want to be in a TV serial. I was in New York doing live
television. Then my agent asked me to read a script. I did and it
was charming. Then when I began the first year, we used the radio
scripts. They concentrated on Bud, and I was just standing around
doing nothing. I was used to being a busy actress, but when they
began writing new scripts we all had a lot to do.''
   She said she gives a lot of credit for the show's success to
Eugene Rodney, who was Young's partner in ownership of the series.
   ``He ran it just like a Broadway show,'' she said. ``It was his
whole life. We were called `Miss Wyatt' and `Mr. Young.' Not a word
of a script could be changed. Every line was written for a specific
character. Each character's personality was so well-defined you
couldn't give someone's line to another character. And all 39
scripts were written in advance.
   ``Each script always solved a little problem that was universal.
It appealed to everyone. I think the world is hankering for a
family. People may want to be free, but they still want a nuclear
family.''
   A new generation probably knows Wyatt for her role as Mr.
Spock's mother on ``Star Trek.'' She appeared in the original TV
series on NBC and in the fourth ``Star Trek'' movie.
   Before ``Father Knows Best,'' Wyatt starred in such movies as
the 1937 version of ``Lost Horizon,'' ``Gentleman's Agreement'' and
``Task Force.'' She's been busy most recently with series guest
shots and TV movies, and she's currently appearing in the
theatrical film ``Amityville: The Horror Goes On.''
   But Wyatt is still famous as Margaret Anderson. On Mother's Day,
she went to Tampa, Fla., for a joint appearance with two other TV
moms, Barbara Billingsley of ``Leave It to Beaver'' and Florence
Henderson of ``The Brady Bunch.''
   Wyatt said there is talk of doing a spinoff of ``Father Knows
Best'' with Elinor Donahue as the mother. Wyatt and Young would
make occasional appearances as the grandparents.
   The CBN Family Channel will present seven episodes from the
original series: ``Second Honeymoon,'' ``Betty, Girl Engineer,''
``Bud, The Willing Worker,'' ``Kathy's Big Chance,'' ``A Medal for
Margaret,'' ``Short Wave,'' and ``Father of the Year.''
   ``I can't get over the interest people still have in the show,''
said Wyatt. ``When we did it we had no idea it would make such a
big splash. ... I went to Peru on a botanical trip last year. The
stewardesses on the plane were all over us. In Lima, we were
besieged by people. The show's called `Papa Lo Sabe Todo' there.'''

<HEAD>Sotheby's To Sell Rare Book Collection of 7,000 Volumes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   H. Bradley Martin was born to money, well
educated, discriminating, loved books and lived a long time _
qualities that made him one of the great book collectors of the
20th century.
   When he died last year at age 82, his library included more than
10,000 books and manuscripts, all of which he kept in his New York
apartment and at Rose Hill, his handsome Georgian house in Virginia.
   ``I suppose we were one of the few families to consider the care
and cleaning of books a favorite activity,'' says his wife,
Jacqueline Martin. ``We loved working together, and we rejoiced
with him in each new edition.''
   Sixty-four years after the 18-year-old Martin purchased his
first rare book _ a copy of ``Tom Sawyer'' _ at a shop on 14th
Street in Manhattan, his collection will be sold at auction by
Sotheby's. The series of eight sales will start June 6 and continue
through the next year. They are expected to fetch more than $30
million.
   A copy of naturalist John James Audubon's masterwork, ``Birds of
America,'' is expected to bring $2 million to $3 million. Edgar
Allen Poe's first edition copy of ``Eureka,'' with his own
annotations, is estimated at $100,000 to $150,000, while a
watercolor of a Woodchat bird is listed at $400 to $600.
   The quality of the sale is so high, said Selby Kiffer, an
assistant vice president at Sotheby's, that non-book collectors _
including people who want only the best for their homes _ are
expected to join the bookish set in tendering bids.
   The first sale, to run June 6-June 8, will focus on Martin's
ornithological collection, considered by experts to be the best in
private hands. His collections of American, English and French
literature, children's books, Americana and natural history books
will be sold later on.
   ``He had lots of the ingredients one needs to have to form a
great collection,'' said David N. Redden, a senior vice president
at the auction house. ``He had wealth. He had a good education. He
had an interest in his collecting area, starting at a very early
age. And he had great taste and discrimination. Put all those
together and you end up with potential for a great collection.''
   Martin was the oldest of five sons of Bradley Martin and Helen
Phipps, and the grandson of Henry Phipps, a partner of Andrew
Carnegie. He lived a privileged life, attending Oxford as an
undergraduate and serving as a director of the trust companies that
managed the family fortune, originally made from steel interests.
   Book collecting was his passion. During World War II, he had
proof sheets for one sale catalog sent to him while serving with
the Office of Strategic Services in North Africa.
   Friends and associates describe him as ``a gentleman in the old
school'' _ polite, quiet, modest, handsome and an interesting
conversationalist. He was also admired as a meticulous collector.
   ``I've been in this business 78 years. My first sale was in
1912,'' said bookseller David Kirschenbaum of Carnegie Bookshop in
Manhattan, a lifelong friend of Martin's. ``There are people who
are accumulators and there are people that are collectors. This is
a collection.
   ``A collector has a reason for every book that he buys; an
accumulator just buys this thing or the other.''
   Martin also gets high marks among book lovers for being a
prolific reader as well as a collector of books. But he spent much
of his time reading catalogs produced by booksellers and auction
houses.
   One of Martin's favorite acquisitions was Audubon's five-volume
folio of 435 handcolored etched plates of 489 supposed species,
including the Trumpeter Swan, the Roseate Spoonbill and the Snowy
Owl. He bought it through the Carnegie Bookshop in 1956. A special
cabinet designed for the folio was the focal point of Martin's
sitting room in New York.
   Other highlights of the collection include his copy of ``The
Federalist,'' which was presented to George Washington by Alexander
Hamilton. The two-volume book, estimated at $250,000 to 400,000,
has Washington's signature and book plate and annotations by James
Madison.
   ``When I picked up the Federalist Papers, which had been on
deposit at the Morgan Library, it was a little nerve-racking,''
said Kiffer who is cataloging the books. ``It was one of the few
times my hands were shaking.''
   Martin's copy of the Declaration of Independence, which is one
of 23 copies known to survive from the original printing of 100, is
expected to fetch $400,000 to $600,000. He acquired it in the 1970s
from a New York City bookseller.
   ``There is tremendous interest in this. There is every
indication that the high estimate will be exceeded,'' Kiffer said.
``There is general concern that this copy might leave the country.''
   Martin carefully assembled his library over 64 years; the
Sotheby's sale will dismantle it in one year.
   But Kirschenbaum, who lunched with Martin three times a week,
said Martin would be happy about the auction. Mrs. Martin is
because the sale will give other collectors a chance to fill out
their own libraries as her husband did.

<HEAD>Business of Medicine IV: Patients, Money Promised to Doctors Selling
Drugs</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Years ago, doctors counted pills into white
envelopes for patients. Today, a new industry is taking over that
role, promising ``practice building'' and ``revenue enhancement''
to doctors who sell the prescriptions they write. In a continuing
series, ``The Business of Medicine,'' Science Writer Daniel Q.
Haney and National Writer Fred Bayles look at the drug repackaging
industry.

   The soft click and hum of pill-counting
machines give a high-tech tone to the operations of the
Pharmaceutical Corporation of America, but the heart of the
business is simplicity itself _ moving medicine from big bottles
into little bottles.
   In the company's brightly lit, air-filtered filling room, women
in surgical garb stuff in cotton, screw on tops and paste on
labels, readying stacks of machine-filled plastic containers for
resale in clinics and doctors' offices around the country.
   Despite its small size, just 12 employees, PCA is a big player
in a new industry called repackaging, a business that is helping
physicians remold themselves from professionals into entrepreneurs
_ and in the process prompting ethical questions and calls by
legislators for tighter regulation of doctors.
   Repackaging houses are mass production versions of the local
drug store. Instead of one pharmacist counting out pills to fill
one prescription, the repackagers buy antibiotics, decongestants
and other drugs from manufacturers in large lots, then break them
down into bottles that can be resold to individual patients. These
are sealed, labeled and shipped to doctors, who add $2 to $4 per
prescription to the wholesale cost.
   An estimated 8 percent of the nation's 330,000 office-based
doctors have become retailers of repackaged medicines.
   ``The repackagers are trying to remake the role of the doctor as
a patient advocate into something else, in effect, making the
physician a vendor,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who has
sponsored legislation to prohibit doctors from selling
prescriptions for profit.
   ``There is a growing number of fast-buck artists who are telling
doctors they can make $50,000 without any more difficulty than
reaching for a prescription pad.''
   Repackagers say they only are responding to an increasingly
competitive medical profession where anything that brings in
additional patients and income to a practice might make the
difference between success or failure.
   ``The industry developed because there was an opportunity,''
said Dr. Mason Goodman, a lung specialist who is also chief
executive officer at PCA. ``All of the changes in the marketplace
made physicians more receptive to this than they would have been 10
years ago.''
   Indeed, 10 years ago the repackaging industry was just getting
started, but it has grown fast.
   Market analyst Joy Twiss Thompson of Marshall &amp; Co. of Atlanta
predicts 10 percent of the $20 billion annual prescription drug
market will move from the pharmacy to the doctor's office over the
next seven years. She estimates repackagers' revenues will climb
from $25 million in 1986 to more than $75 million this year.
   ``When I survey doctors and nurses to see their attitudes, I
could probably sell 10 to 15 accounts in an average day,'' she
said. ``They have been waiting for a dispensing company. The
repackagers have not had the ability to get out and meet the
demand.''
   Critics say the demand was created in part by hard-sell
brochures and medical journal ads that promised doctors up to
$50,000 a year in additional income. One ad, no longer used by PCA,
talked of $15,000 to $30,000 ``with no additional work.''
   Much of the advertising has cooled, partly in response to
criticism. The repackagers now emphasize physician dispensing as a
convenience to patients and a way to build a practice.
   ``It's not a huge money maker, but it's a great practice
enhancement tool,'' said Goodman of PCA. ``The first law in
medicine is not to erode your patient population. You want to grow
it.''
   Steven Geringer, executive vice president of the Nashville-based
Clinical Pharmaceuticals Inc., puts profits from drug sales at
$8,000 to $10,000 annually for the average doctor.
   Many repackagers say their business strategy was _ and in many
cases still is _ aimed at clinics, ambulatory care centers and
large group practices. Smaller physicians' offices, they say, don't
do the volume of drug sales the repackagers need to make a profit.
   ``This is a business of low margin with high selling costs,''
said Charles Hampton, chairman and president of Allscrips
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Vernon Hills, Ill. ``About half our
business by number are groups under five, but in terms of volume
they probably account for less than a third of our sales.''
   Allscrips is a good example of how the repackaging industry
began and grew. Founded three years ago by Hampton, a former drug
company executive, and funded with venture capital from Allstate
Insurance Co. and several other groups, the company is approaching
$20 million in annual revenues.
   ``We got into it because there were a lot of things happening in
the market,'' Hampton said. ``There was the growth of the urgent
care centers and the large group practices where they were
traditionally dispensing out of envelopes. There was a change in
the industry in general.''
   But this change has brought calls for tighter regulation of
dispensing doctors.
   While the repackagers are regulated as drug companies under
federal and state law, a recent study by the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services' inspector general's office found less
governmental scrutiny of drug selling doctors than of pharmacists.
   ``We felt there should be some of the same procedural
requirements that exist for pharmacists, such as record-keeping,
supervision and labeling,'' said Martha Kvaal, a deputy regional
inspector general who headed the study.
   Kvaal also noted some 15 states reported taking disciplinary
action against physicians for dispensing abuses since 1986. Often
it was for procedural errors, such as improper labeling of
medication. But there also have been cases of overprescribing by
physicians who make money from drug sales.
   Such concerns led Rep. Wyden to file a bill last year to ban
doctors from selling drugs for profit. The bill, which failed to
make it to a House vote, was strongly opposed by repackagers, who
formed the Competitive Health Care Coalition and hired Washington
lobbyists and public relation consultants to fight the bill.
   Geringer, who headed the coalition, said the bill would have
killed his industry even though it would still allow physicians to
dispense drugs at cost.
   ``If there weren't any profit in it, the doctors wouldn't do
it,'' Geringer said.
   The repackagers have found an ally in the federal government.
The Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition has endorsed
physician dispensing and even advised Maryland and Georgia against
over-regulation.
   The two states are among some 20 that over the past three years
have tightened regulations on doctors who sell drugs.
   The repackaging industry is likely to flourish. The new Medicare
Catastrophic Coverage Act allows doctors to be reimbursed by the
government for drugs they sell to elderly patients, and repackagers
are lobbying insurers to include doctors in their drug coverage.
   Analysts like Thompson even see repackagers branching into other
products to market through physicians offices' _ weight loss
programs that include diet food, behavior modification tapes and
other materials.
   Geringer see nothing wrong with using doctors' offices as retail
outlets.
   ``If a client is sitting out there, you want to think of other
things you can sell them,'' he said. ``That's true of any
business.''

   Move over, Donald Trump. Step aside, Frank Lorenzo. Lex Luthor,
the cunning comic-book villain and archenemy of Superman, is in the
hostile takeover business and pillaging the blue-chip pickings of
Metropolis.
   Lately the baldheaded billionaire bad guy has schemed to acquire
Scientific and Technological Advanced Research Laboratories, a
rival to his LexCorp Group.
   Yes, the folks at D.C. Comics Inc. magazines have discovered a
theme already milked by the Hollywood producers of ``Wall Street''
and ``Working Girl'' _ corporate takeovers and foxy financiers make
good entertainment.
   The April and May issues of ``Superman'' and ``The Adventures of
Superman'' featured ``Lex Luthor's Hostile Takeover.'' Some
real-life professionals call it an intricate and accurate portrayal
of big business at its greediest.
   With Superman off in outer space for soul-searching meditation
during these episodes, the companies of Metropolis _ many already
have been acquired by LexCorp subsidiaries _ are defenseless
against further Luthor raids.
   But wait. Before going further, some explanation. Four years
ago, Superman and the regular characters in his exploits were
retooled for the 1980s and beyond.
   Luthor, for instance, went from crafty criminal scientist bent
on world destruction to conniving corporate genius desiring world
domination. Capital and calculators are as important to today's
Luthor as robots and ray guns were to his predecessor. But Superman
remains his nemesis.
   ``To most people on the street, Lex Luthor isn't a bad guy. He's
the guy who signs their pay checks,'' writer Roger Stern said in a
telephone interview from Ithaca, New York. ``The old Luthor could
make a death ray out of an aspirin and an alarm clock. But this
Luthor is really scary. He's really amoral.''
   So, with the Man of Steel temporarily out of the picture, Luthor
is plotting. Stern gives him a challenge on scale with the massive
mergers and acquisitions that dominate newspaper business pages.
   Part One. A peek into a meeting of LexCorp directors reveals a
discussion of takeover targets. Luthor nixes them. A glance out the
window at the building across the street reveals his target _
S.T.A.R. Labs.
   The reader finds later that Luthor doesn't want the whole
company, just its brain-researching ``psionics lab,'' part of his
obsession with obtaining technology to destroy Superman.
   Part Two. Luthor lets it slip that he's interested in S.T.A.R.
Rumors rock the market. The price of S.T.A.R. stock spirals.
Company division heads meet, angry that they haven't been told of a
possible takeover. S.T.A.R.'s chief executive officer tries to calm
them. It's just rumors. But LexCorp would be a good parent for
S.T.A.R., he says.
   Division heads disagree. Many threaten to quit if Luthor gains
control. The mere possibility of Luthor at the helm prompts five
S.T.A.R. researchers to take early retirement.
   ``It's realistic and plausible,'' said Tony Viscogliosi, a
securities research analyst at Roney &amp; Co., a Detroit investment
concern. ``When you do an acquisition in a research lab, it can't
be a hostile takeover. Its assets are its people. If they walk,
you've got nothing. It's similar to what might happen in the
takeover of a pharmaceutical company like Upjohn.''
   Part Three. As speculative buying of its stock continues,
S.T.A.R. decides to fight Luthor by lobbing a ``poison pill''
defense at him. It issues thousands of shares of new stock that
will make a takeover more difficult.
   S.T.A.R. sells its psionics unit to raise cash _ unwittingly to
a dummy corporation controlled by Luthor _ while searching in vain
for a friendly ``white knight'' buyer for the rest of the company.
   Part Four. Luthor announces he no longer is interested in
S.T.A.R. The stock price plummets. S.T.A.R. is ruined. Luthor walks
away, the psionics lab in his possession through his shell company.
He's made millions by riding up the price of the S.T.A.R. stock he
owned, then later dumped.
   ``I don't think it was very far off the mark if you take the
comic-bookness out of it,'' Viscogliosi said.
   He said Luthor played to the news media throughout the series
with the deft touch of Trump, the billionaire property mogul. The
S.T.A.R. employees' distaste at working for Luthor reminded him of
the antagonism that striking Eastern airline employees have
expressed for their boss, Lorenzo.
   ``What's important in the market is not who acquires the shares.
It's who controls them,'' Viscogliosi said. ``In one story, this
brought up all the relevant ethical and moral issues that are faced
by all the interested parties in one of these deals.''
   While Viscogliosi found few faults with Stern's tale, he said
the Securities and Exchange Commission likely would have sued
Luthor for stock manipulation.
   The possibility of SEC investigators going after him was hinted
in the comic tale, but Luthor dismissed it, saying ``the only
people who might tell them do not dare.''

   In the new world according to President Bush, the
West has won the Cold War _ even though it isn't over yet.
   Time and again, Bush has told the Soviet Union that it is the
losing side. That theme accompanies and helps to explain his drive
for U.S. policy that looks beyond containment of the Soviets.
   After summoning the Atlantic allies to join in an effort to
redraw the military map of Europe with sharp East-West cuts in
conventional weapons, Bush urged that the political map be redrawn,
too.
   And on Western terms.
   He wants to erase lines that carved Europe apart after World War
II. He promises to carry that quest beyond ``the rusting Iron
Curtain'' when he goes to Poland and Hungary next month.
   ``The Cold War began with the division of Europe,'' Bush said in
Mainz, West Germany, on Wednesday. ``It can only end when Europe is
whole.''
   And Bush sees that coming, with ``the liberating power of
democracy'' already at work in eastern Europe. He said the West and
its values have succeeded, while in the Communist world, ``their
vision failed.''
   The words aren't as harsh as the ones Ronald Reagan once used,
consigning the Soviets to the ash heap of history, denouncing their
``evil empire.'' Bush calls them losers, citing their political and
economic performance as evidence.
   ``Winds of change are blowing in Eastern Europe, including the
Soviet Union,'' Bush said in a dinner toast at a West German
castle. ``It is happening, in part, because Mr. Gorbachev has seen
that our society works and that his does not.''
   The president has said repeatedly that he wants the reforms of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev to succeed.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said that is the
administration's hope ``because what he is doing is embracing the
political and economic agenda of the West.''
   ``The West has won,'' Baker said. ``We've won the struggle of
the past 40 years ... The Soviet Union is moving in our direction,
and we ought to continue to encourage their moving in our
direction.''
   Constant reminders of Soviet failures have to be grating in
Moscow.
   Bush's words are, in a way, further rebuttals, 33 years later,
to Nikita S. Khrushchev's claim that ``history is on our side . . .
We will bury you.''
   ``The situation is favorable for us,'' Khrushchev said in 1956.
``If God existed, we would thank him for this.''
   Those taunts echoed for years in U.S. foreign policy debates.
There are no such menacing words from Bush, but what he's saying
may have a political echo inside the Soviet Union, with opponents
of the Gorbachev course.
   Then again, Bush also has a hard-line conservative bloc to
handle at home. His emphasis on ``the momentum for freedom'' as
western political and economic ideas move eastward will soften
conservative opposition to his arms control ideas.
   ``As president, I will continue to do all I can to help open the
closed societies of the East,'' Bush said in Mainz. ``We seek
self-determination for all of Germany and all of Eastern Europe.
And we will not relax and we must not waver.''
   Well aware of his own conservative constituency, Bush and his
aides were careful to note that they are not doing Gorbachev any
favors with the new-look arms control offer.
   ``This proposal is very, very good for the United States,''
Baker said. ``That's why he has suggested it. It's not something
we're doing for the Soviet Union.''
   But no deal flies if it does not have benefits for both sides.
Bush pointed out more than once that by accepting his offer,
Gorbachev could save defense dollars and ease his own economic
problems.
   For good measure, Bush and Baker both have dared Gorbachev to do
some more unilateral arms cutting, to offer deeds to match words.
   ``Prudence and realism will be the standards which will guide
this relationship,'' the secretary of state said. ``The fact that
the president has put a bold proposal on the table doesn't mean
that he has abandoned prudence and realism.''
   Bush and his high command know at first hand the political peril
that can come from the Republican right. They worked for President
Gerald R. Ford during an earlier cycle of thaw followed by Soviet
buildup, during a 1976 campaign in which pressure from Reagan's
Republican right forced the word ``detente'' out of the
administration vocabulary.
   The president also sought to reassure the Soviets that he does
not seek ``to undermine their legitimate security interests. Our
goal is to convince them, step by step, that their definition of
security is obsolete, that their deepest fears are unfounded.''
   That is an ambitious undertaking. Since World War II ended, the
Soviet concept of security has been founded on a Communist zone in
central and eastern Europe. Russian suspicion of the West has
historic roots that go deeper than Communism.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge jumped 0.8 percent in April, the Commerce Department
reported, easing fears that the nation might be about to tumble
into a recession.
   The increase reported Wednesday in the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators followed declines of 0.3 percent in February and 0.6
percent in March. Three monthly declines in a row has been a
traditional signal of a possible recession on the horizon.
   Still, analysts were not suggesting the strong numbers for April
meant a robust economy this summer.

   Eastern Airlines said it will expand from 79 daily
flights in June to 221 in July, the company's largest increase in
service since a strike began March 4.
   Eastern said Wednesday it will serve 27 cities in June and 52 in
July as it moves toward a new full schedule of 600 flights by the
end of the year.
   Separately, travel industry executives meeting in New York said
the strike against Eastern continues to disrupt the Caribbean
tourism industry, slashing business at some hotels and sending air

<HEAD>TV Ratings Company Joins Sarnoff Center on Passive Meter Development</HEAD>

   Advertising agency and network officials say
they are encouraged by an effort by the leading national TV ratings
company to develop a system that measures who watches television by
recognizing viewers' faces.
   They said they agreed with the sponsors' assessment that the
passive measurement system would provide a more accurate reading of
TV audiences than existing systems that require viewers to push
buttons or write down what they have watched.
   The passive system would use a camera-like recorder programmed
to recognize faces and to note electronically when specific members
of a family watch TV.
   Nielsen Media Research, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. unit that
compiles national TV ratings, announced Wednesday that it had
reached an agreement with the David Sarnoff Research Center of
Princeton, N.J., to jointly develop the passive TV-viewing
measurement system.
   The system could have potentially wide-reaching effects on a
medium that carried nearly $25 billion in advertising last year.
   It is being developed as advertisers are demanding more proof
and media outlets such as the TV networks are under more pressure
to show that advertising is reaching its intended targets. Ratings
are used to help set prices for commercial time.
   ``We support their effort 110 percent,'' said Richard Kostyra,
director of media services for the ad agency J. Walter Thompson.
   He said the passive system brings researchers closer to
measuring ``actually what is happening'' rather than relying on a
survey group's cooperation in pushing buttons or writing down what
they watched.
   Nielsen has been measuring national TV audiences with a ``people
meter'' system since 1987 that automatically records the channel a
set is tuned to while relying on those watching to punch in when
they start watching TV and punch out when they leave.
   For local ratings, Nielsen has people note in diaries what shows
each member of the family watched during a given period.
   Advertisers and the television networks long have complained
that systems requiring viewers to do something while they are
watching TV may distort estimates of who is watching specific shows.
   John A. Dimling, a top marketing executive for Nielsen, said a
passive system should yield ``even higher quality, more accurate
data because the respondents don't have to do anything'' other than
``be themselves.''
   Dimling said the passive system could eliminate the problem of
people who simply grow weary of pushing a button each time they
start or quit watching TV.
   The networks have argued that children, for instance, often fail
to punch the people meter buttons and say the ratings therefore
understate the audience for children's programming.
   Bill Reubens, who as an NBC research executive was very critical
of the introduction of people meters, said the passive meter system
``would be a major step forward.''
   ``I think everybody felt the people meter was an intermediate
step,'' said Reubens, who retired from NBC at the end of 1988 but
continues to do consulting on ratings methodology for NBC, CBS and
ABC.
   Dimling said the passive system could also someday be used to
measure who is watching individual commercials as well as shows.
   Nielsen selected the Sarnoff Research Center as its partner in
the passive meter project because of the center's extensive work in
image recognition.
   Sarnoff, formerly the research arm of RCA Corp. but now , calls
its image recognition approach ``Smart-Sensing'' and would use it
in connection with TV audience measurement to recognize the faces
of those watching television.
   The sensory equipment could be packaged to resemble a
videocassette recorder and placed on top of the television set. It
would electronically record the names of those it recognizes and
the periods during which they watched television. Strangers would
be listed simply as visitors.
   Asked whether the system is ``too Big Brotherish,'' Dimling
said, ``I don't think we are talking about Big Brother here at
all.''
   He said the system would not film or otherwise record anything
that goes on in the room other than the names of those watching TV.
And he noted the equipment would be installed only in homes where
families agree to it.

<HEAD>Caribbean Tourism Feeling Impact of Eastern Strike, Executives Say</HEAD>

   The Caribbean tourism industry continues to be
pinched by the 3-month-old strike against Eastern Airlines, with
business slashed at some hotels and air fares in the region
soaring, some travel industry executives say.
   ``It makes a tremendous difference ... it's a major concern to
us,'' John Bell, executive vice president of the Caribbean Hotel
Association, said in an interview Wednesday.
   Bell said some hotels in the popular resort region had lost as
much as 40 percent of their business this season due to the strike
by Machinists union members, pilots and flight attendants against
Miami-based Eastern, which began March 4 and sharply curtailed the
airline's operations.
   The losses were greatest in the Bahamas and Puerto Rico, said
Bell, whose association represents 740 hotels in 31 Caribbean
countries.
   Eastern has reduced its Caribbean operations to flights to the
Bahamas, Puerto Rico and Haiti, compared with its pre-strike
schedule of about a dozen Caribbean destinations.
   The president of one large tour operator that sought bankruptcy
protection from creditors due to the impact of the Eastern walkout
said discount fares to the Caribbean now cost substantially more
than last year and are less available.
   Joseph Garzilli, president of Flyfaire Inc., considered one of
the biggest U.S. tour operators specializing in Caribbean vacation
packages, said the cheapest round-trip fare between New York and
San Juan, Puerto Rico, was $249 on American Airlines, compared with
$174 last year on Eastern.
   ``There have been some great voids in the marketplace,'' said
Garzilli, whose Hawthorne, N.Y.-based business sought protection
from creditors on March 13, four days after Eastern did so.
   Garzilli said the retreat of Eastern, which had been the leader
in discount fares to the Caribbean, means cheaper fares are
``slowly slipping away.''
   Some competitors, such as American and Eastern's sister carrier,
Continental Airlines, have increased their flights in the region
since the Eastern strike.
   Flyfaire, which had used Eastern flights as the basis for about
70 percent of its tour packages, says Eastern owes it about $1.5
million. Garzilli said, however, that Flyfaire has continued
operating under bankruptcy protection and doesn't plan to sever its
relationship with Eastern if the airline returns to the Caribbean.
   Bell spoke earlier at a news conference announcing a new program
by which travel agents dealing with Flyfaire would make payments to
Caribbean hotels. Mark MacKenzie, a senior director of Citicorp
Services Inc. in Chicago, said the Eastern situation had aggravated
the long-standing problem of hotel payment delays in the region.
   Eastern stopped paying creditors, including tour operators,
after it sought bankruptcy court protection. That in turn delayed
or dried up payments by those businesses to hotels.
   Under the new hotel payment program, all payments to Caribbean
hotels from Flyfaire vacation packages will be processed through
Citicorp's World Travel Payment system. Citicorp will receive
payments from travel agents and send them directly to hotels.
   Traditionally, payments to hotels in the Caribbean pass through
airlines or tour operators, often causing delays of up to four
months, industry executives say.
   If the new system had been in place before the Eastern strike,
Flyfaire wouldn't have been forced into a bankruptcy proceeding,
Garzilli said, because the tour operator wouldn't have had to rely
on payments from Eastern to pass on to hotels.
   Other Caribbean tour operators are expected to join Flyfaire in
the program, Citicorp's MacKenzie said.
   Eastern management plans to rebuild Eastern into a smaller
carrier and sell about $1.8 billion of its assets. Some financial
analysts and other observers believe the carrier might sell its
Caribbean routes under the plan.
   The Eastern plan still must be approved by the federal
bankruptcy court in New York.

   Corporate television, growing faster than
cable, commercial and public broadcasting, is still in its infancy,
but it's a mighty healthy $6 billion baby.
   The industry, boosted by the VCR boom and satellite technology,
celebrated its roots and its future Wednesday at the annual meeting
of the International Television Association, which represents TV
producers.
   ``In the 1980s, television has become an integral part of
corporate culture,'' said Len Magsamen, president of ITVA, which
was born in San Francisco 21 years ago and has helped spur the
corporate TV industry to a 20 percent annual growth rate.
   ``The vast majority of Fortune 500 companies are already using
video and the demand for it will not subside,'' he said. ``All our
indicators show demand is going through the roof.''
   Businesses are using video, live or on tape, in several ways: to
communicate quickly with their employees and management around the
country or overseas; to introduce products and promote them to
clients; to market directly to customers at home; and to train
workers.
   With videocassette recorders in nearly 60 percent of American
homes, corporations are finding video an effective marketing tool,
said Carl Levine, director of corporate television services at
Unitel Video Inc. in New York, which provides video production
facilities to companies.
   ``The home VCR market is a fourth (TV) network,'' said Levine.
``The rapid growth of the home VCR market, which is peaking now,
has created a distribution medium for corporate-sponsored programs
to go into homes. Look for that in the 1990s as being a very large
growth area.''
   He cited such tapes as a camera company's instructional video on
how to take pictures, with a catalog of accessories at the end; a
power tool company's home improvement video featuring its products;
Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue; and financial programs
designed for seniors, young married couples or other groups.
   ``Corporations can target a specific audience, produce a program
and, through their mailing lists or in-store promotions, reach
their audience on a cost-efficient basis,'' Levine said.
   The biggest change the business television industry has seen
over the last few years, Magsamen said, has been the increasing
number of independent companies or individuals who are hired by
corporations for production, editing, writing, taping and other
jobs.
   ``Corporations need the same production values that viewers have
grown accustomed to when they watch broadcast, cable or home video
programming,'' Levine said.
   But many large corporations, such as American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., GTE Corp., Federal Express Corp. and Hewlett-Packard
Co., maintain their own video departments.
   ``Our chairman considers video a critical tool to communicate,''
said Linda Evans, manager of AT&amp;T's corporate television operation
in Basking Ridge, N.J. ``It allows us to put a human face on
business. As we grow in our satellite network, it allows us to kill
rumors quickly. On critical matters, we prefer to have employees
hear about things from us than read about it in the newspaper.''
   Evans oversees a dozen producers, plus two dozen engineers,
editors and other staffers. Cameramen are hired on a freelance
basis.
   ``We do about 200 programs each year, mostly informational, but
they are increasingly product-oriented for sales,'' she said. The
company has its own satellite TV network with 150 downlink sites
around the country.
   To commemorate the fifth anniversary of the ``new AT&amp;T,'' the
company used 27 crews to produce a program called ``All In A Day's
Work,'' which premiered to employees in January on the satellite
network and was released on tape. It also was shown to shareholders
at the annual meeting and was used by an advertising company to
create three commercials for network television.
   ``That saved the company about $7 million of advertising,''
Evans said. ``The program has paid for itself many times over.''
   Business television will continue to outpace other segments of
the TV industry, Levine predicted.
   ``Broadcast television has been cutting back in recent years,
offering many employees early retirement packages, and the cable
industry has never turned into the form of original programming
people expected,'' he said.
   ``If you look at the independent market, especially outside
Hollywood or New York, the largest portion of their business is for
the corporate sector.'' More than 2,000 video producers are
attending the convention. ITVA has 9,000 U.S. members and 3,500 in
14 other countries.

   When an advertisement for Tropicana orange juice
showed Olympic decathlon winner Bruce Jenner squeezing oranges into
a carton, the message was that Tropicana, unlike other brands, is
not made from concentrate.
   But the Coca-Cola Co., maker of rival Minute Maid, complained.
And a court eventually said the ad was false, because Tropicana
juice is not, in fact, squeezed directly from oranges into the
carton. It is pasteurized and usually frozen first.
   With that decision, Tropicana Products Inc. became one of a long
list of companies to learn the hard way that a major comparative ad
campaign that does not elicit a lawsuit is a rare creature.
   Until the 1970s, television networks prevented advertisers from
mentioning comparable products by name, forcing them to mumble
politely about ``Brand X.''
   Since then, however, the no-holds-barred approach to advertising
has proliferated _ and so have lawsuits.
   ``Every competitive advertiser should be ready to go to court,''
marketing experts Bruce Buchanan and Doron Goldman warned in the
May-June issue of the Harvard Business Review. ``Once your
competitor files suit, you can do little to stop the process.''
   Congress may have accelerated the lawsuits last year by
strengthening the fair advertising laws. In addition, companies
that suffer real or imagined slights by competitors have grown
testy and are now quick to shoot back in court.
   Even if they lose, they figure, they may dissuade someone else
from trying the same thing.
   Under the Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, anyone who
misrepresents ``his or her or another person's'' goods or services
is liable for damages.
   That wording closed a loophole in the 43-year-old Lanham Act,
which prohibited false claims about one's own products but did not
mention ``another person's.''
   Buchanan and Goldman, who are researchers at New York
University's Stern School of Business, say it is too early to tell
whether the tougher law will lead to a rash of lawsuits.
   But they maintain there was no shortage of such actions under
the old law. They counted more than 60 judicial decisions in
comparative advertising cases, half of them in the last four years.
   Even that number is conservative, they say, because many more
cases probably were settled out of court.
   ``We have no absolute figures, but the activity in the courts
certainly seems to be increasing,'' Buchanan said in an interview
Wednesday.
   In many cases, a successful suit leads only to an injunction
banning the offending ads from the airwaves or print media. But if
the plaintiff can show harm, the stakes can be higher.
   When Jartran Inc. ran ads touting its rental trucks, for
example, it put U-Haul International's competing trucks in the
background so they looked small and unattractive. The ploy
backfired when a court ruled the ads were ``deliberately false''
and ordered Jartran to pay U-Haul $40 million in compensatory and
punitive damages.
   But even claims that appear largely truthful have been
challenged successfully.
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., for example, got in trouble when it
said its Now cigarettes had ``the lowest tar of all'' brands on the
market, with only 2 milligrams of tar apiece.
   That may have been true for comparable king-size brands. But
Carlton 70, a shorter brand, had only 1 milligram. Its maker,
American Brands Inc., went to court and won.
   Despite the pitfalls, advertising agencies like Ogilvy &amp; Mather
say comparative ads are more popular than ever, with manufacturers
of pain relievers, pickup trucks and soft drinks constantly going
head-to-head.
   ``You have to be very, very sure of your claims,'' said Mary
McElyea, a spokeswoman for Chevrolet trucks, which has been
pounding Ford Motor Co. trucks in comparative ads since late 1987.
   ``But if you're careful, it can be very effective. The name of
the game is, cut through the clutter and make it clear to the
customer why your product is better.''

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas Gortari's National
Development Plan for 1989-1994 promises the modernization and
economic recovery that have been his themes since he was a
candidate.
   ``Change in our politics, economy and society is
indispensable,'' Salinas said Wednesday as he unveiled the program
for his six-year term at a ceremony at the National Palace.
   He has been saying much the same thing since he was a candidate
last year.
   But six months into his presidency, Salinas now speaks with the
authority of some solid progress on one of Mexico's most pressing
problems: its $107.4 billion foreign debt.
   Salinas has liberalized the rules on foreign investment, kept
inflation under control, continued to sell state-owned industries,
cracked down on union and stock market corruption and eased
Mexico's dependence on oil.
   Creditors have reacted favorably.
   The Club of Paris, the name given Mexico's 16 primary creditor
nations, agreed this week to cut the debt by $2.6 billion and
refinance 80 percent of the interest over the next decade. The
International Monetary Fund last week approved a credit line of
$4.1 billion, 40 percent of which can be used for the debt.
   Debt payments _ which totalled $16 billion last year and were
expected to be even higher this year _ are consuming resources that
Salinas wants to use for development.
   Progress on the debt, the second-largest in the developing
world, is critical to the 41-year-old president's goal of presiding
over a steady _ and impressive _ economic growth rate of 6 percent
a year.
   Salinas warned that such a dramatic turnaround in the economy
and the other reforms he has promised will require effort on many
fronts from virtually every segment of Mexican society.
   Mexico's problems, he warned, go deeper than the debt.
   ``Let's not fall into thinking that once this obstacle has been
overcome, we will have resolved all our problems,'' he said.
   Mexico, which has been ruled by the same political party for 60
years, has a long history of protectionism and official paternalism
that permitted steady growth from the 1940s through the 1970s but
fostered an industry and work force that are inefficient and
dependent on government subsidies.
   All that must change, Salinas said, stressing the importance of
developing a productive work force capable of competing in
international markets.
   ``A closed and inefficient economy is incapable of satisfying
the needs of the population,'' said Salinas.
   Among those needs are the creation of 1 million new jobs a year
and the construction of at least 300,000 new homes, he said.
   ``The people demand food, education, housing, health services,
security and a clean environment: in short, personal and family
progress on their horizon.''
   Although his 164-page blueprint proposes the ``modernization of
the nation in all its aspects,'' the focus is clearly economics.
   Mexico's economic crisis began when the bottom fell out of the
oil market in 1982 after several boom years of heavy borrowing.
Inflation began spiraling upward, reaching a record 159.7 percent
in 1987, and the buying power of the average worker eroded to half
the pre-boom levels.
   Salinas, a Harvard-educated economist, tried to engineer
economic stability and modernization since the early 1980s, when he
was a deputy treasury secretary and later budget secretary under
former President Miguel de la Madrid.

   Maxicare Health Plans Inc., which is

   Maxicare, once the nation's largest publicly traded HMO with
more than 2 million members, is operating under Chapter 11 of the

District Court in Santa Ana in March.
   The company currently operates in California, Illinois, Indiana,
Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Wisconsin.

<HEAD>Congressional Report Sees Danger to Trade With Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional report warns of danger to 2
million American jobs and $75 billion worth of U.S. exports because
of the efforts by West European countries to eliminate internal
trade barriers by 1992.
   The plans of the European Community are sometimes called
``EC-92.'' A congressional subcommittee has been holding hearings
on their effect.
   ``Witness after witness, 21 in all, argued that despite many
benefits of EC-92 to U.S. business, key aspects... were already
reducing, and would continue to reduce, American exports to the EC
and U.S. jobs in critical sectors of the economy,'' Rep. Sam
Gejdenson, D-Conn., said Wednesday.
   Gejdenson chairs the subcommittee on international economic
policy of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The subcommittee
approved the report without dissent, but only three of the 13
members attended the session.
   Gejdenson singled out the process by which the European
governments are setting standards for their industries. He said the
Europeans do not let outside observers take part in the process,
while U.S. standard-setting is open.
   He said he had not heard of the agreement, announced earlier
Wednesday, to resume talks on standards this summer. The Commerce
Department said U.S. products would get the same access to testing
and certification procedures as European products. Ella Krucoff,
press officer for the EC delegation in Washington, said that did
not mean American firms _ except those with subsidiaries in Europe
_ could take part in setting the standards.
   Gejdenson also complained that:
   _European rules require that some imported products, such as
auto parts and electronic equipment, be manufactured partially
within the 12 member countries.
   ``Though many of the policies requiring a high level of European
content in products assembled in the EC are aimed at Japan, the
effect(s) of these policies are already being felt by the U.S.
electronics industry,'' he said.
   _In some cases American companies will not be treated the same
way as EC companies after 1992. ``This would likely result in a
continuing U.S. inability to win bids for contracts in the $600
billion per year EC government procurement market,'' Gejdenson said.
   The subcommittee recommended:
   _That the Bush administration adopt a more aggressive strategy
instead of reacting to European decisions.
   _That a firm timetable be set for negotiations with the EC
unless difficulties are settled in the 96-government ``Uruguay
round'' of trade talks
   _The United States press for observer status at sessions where
European industry standards are set.
   _An increase in the staffing level of the U.S. mission to the EC
in Brussels and of groups analyzing EC decisions
   ``While taking a hard line on protectionist EC-92 policies may
cause friction in the short run, such actions will improve
long-term U.S.-EC trade relations,'' Gejdenson predicted.

<HEAD>Layoff of 6,000 Latest Fallout of Defense Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the latest shock wave to hit the aerospace
industry from Pentagon budget-tightening, Hughes Aircraft Co.
announced it would lay off 6,000 workers over the next six months.
   The layoffs announced Wednesday, which amount to 8 percent of
Hughes' workforce, follow smaller reductions at Northrop Corp. and
Grumman Corp. Analysts predict the Bush administration's
tight-fisted approach to defense spending will bring further
layoffs and cut into profits in the aerospace industry.
   ``It presumably is the first blast of winter in the defense
environment but I don't think it will be the last,'' said Wolfgang
Demisch, who follows the industry for UBS Securities Inc. in New
York.
   Hughes will lay off workers in all areas of management,
engineering and manufacturing, the company said.
   Hughes, a General Motors Corp. subsidiary, has 75,000 employees
in 12 states, with the bulk of its work force in Southern
California and around Tucson, Ariz.
   Hughes will try to cushion the blow by making some staff cuts
through attrition and voluntary resignations, and offering
retraining and job-hunting help.
   The company's Pentagon work includes manufacture of air-to-air
and air-to-ground missiles, satellites, radar for fighter jets and
other military gear.
   The decision was based on executives' expectation that defense
budgets under the Bush administration will be smaller than they
were under Ronald Reagan, the company said.
   ``We're getting down to fighting trim,'' said Malcolm Currie,
Hughes' chairman and chief executive officer.
   Industry-wide aerospace employment fell 1.7 percent in 1988, to
1.3 million, largely because of slower military sales attributed to
a slowing of the defense buildup begun by Reagan. A similar decline
is expected this year, according to the Aerospace Industries
Association, which compiles the figures.
   The administration's 1990 budget before Congress would devote
$295.6 billion to the military, down from the $305.6 billion
proposed by the outgoing Reagan administration and below the $299.3
billion earmarked for this year. Because the bulk of military
spending is for such fixed-cost items as salary and retirement
benefits, the brunt of any cuts falls on development and purchase
of hardware.
   The result: Fewer contracts for new aerospace programs,
stretched-out buying schedules for programs already under way and
layoffs at companies trying to maintain their profits.
   ``Every company in the business will be touched by job losses
over the next year or two,'' predicted Howard Rubel, an industry
analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence in New York.
   Grumman has announced plans to lay off 3,000 on Long Island, New
York, and Los Angeles-based Northrop says it plans to cut its
44,000-member work force by 2,500 to 3,000 over the course of the
year.
   To some extent, job losses in this normally cyclical industry
will be offset by a boom in civilian airliner construction.
   But only two U.S. companies, Boeing Corp. and McDonnell Douglas
Corp. make big civilian planes, and civil aviation accounts for
only about 30 percent of the industry.
   Hughes' layoffs aren't a response to changes in any one
contract, said spokesman Mike Murphy, who noted that no one
contract accounts for more than 6 percent of sales, he said.
   However, the company may be smarting from Pentagon decisions in
the last two years to qualify a second company to submit
competitive bids on several key Hughes contracts. Among the weapons
are three plane-launched missiles, the AMRAAM, Maverick and
Phoenix, which Raytheon Corp. won the right to bid on.
   GM doesn't reveal separate financial data for Hughes Aircraft.
GM-Hughes Electronics Corp., the aircraft company's parent,
reported profit of $256.9 million on sales of $11.24 billion in
1988. That was down from profit of $219.2 million on sales of
$10.48 billion the year before.

   Coleco Industries Inc. creditors say they have
agreed to settle lawsuits stemming from the troubled toymaker's
11-month bankruptcy case.
   The settlement, announced Wednesday during a hearing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, must be approved by the court.
   Meanwhile, no details were released about a proposal by Hasbro
Inc., the nation's largest toy manufacturer, to purchase most of
Coleco. But Daniel Golden, an attorney for Coleco, said
negotiations concerning the sale of most Coleco assets continued.
   Richard Tilton, a lawyer for Hasbro, said he expected a joint
statement on the proposed sale would be issued next week. He
declined to discuss details of the plan, saying it still was
``subject to a number of conditions that need to be discussed.''
   The creditors' settlement announced Wednesday calls for Coleco's
largest creditors, Isaac Perlmutter and Bernard Marden, to receive
$61 million of their $87 million claim against Coleco.
   Unsecured creditors of the company based in Avon, Conn., would
drop their $71 million lawsuit against Perlmutter and Marden, under
the settlement.
   The unsecured creditors had claimed that Perlmutter and Marden,
secured creditors, cheated Coleco out of millions of dollars
through a complex scheme of trading television advertising time for
products.
   Tilton said the settlement would mean that Perlmutter could not
finance Coleco's reorganization plan as originally intended. But
Tilton said alternative sources of funding could be found. He did
not elaborate.
   Coleco, which grew to be one of the nation's largest toymakers
during the past decade, suffered a change in fortune in 1986, when
demand for its Cabbage Patch dolls dropped.
   New lines introduced by the company failed to make up for lost
sales, and Coleco sought Bankruptcy Court protection last July,
citing debts of $540.3 million.
   A first reorganization plan filed by Coleco in January was
rejected immediately by the creditors' committee.
   The plan would have given Perlmutter and Marden 55 percent of
the stock of a reorganized Coleco and a note for $40 million in
cash. Creditors would have received about 36 percent of Coleco
stock and no cash, a plan they valued at about 5 cents for every $1
they are owed.
   In March, Coleco said it was considering a sale of the company,
but reversed itself a few weeks later, filing a new reorganization
plan it hoped would satisfy creditors.
   The new plan offered a larger repayment, including about 10
cents for every $1 of debt, plus 37 percent of Coleco's stock.
   On April 19, before the second plan was filed with the
Bankruptcy Court, creditors announced they had negotiated a deal to
sell most of Coleco to Hasbro for more than $85 million in cash.
   The deal would add well-known Coleco items such as the Cabbage
Patch Kids and Scrabble and Parcheesi board games to Hasbro's
product lines, it has been reported.
   Coleco officials, upset by the Hasbro proposal, asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Prudence B. Abram on April 20 to issue a
restraining order prohibiting creditors from pursuing the plan with
Hasbro.
   Instead, Abram urged the two sides to strike a compromise.

<TEXT>
   Freshman engineering enrollments rose last
fall for the first time since 1982, with minorities making up more
than half the increase, the National Action Council for Minorities
in Engineering said today.
   Black, Hispanic and American Indian students accounted for 55
percent of a 2.7 percent increase in freshman enrollment from fall
1987 to fall 1988, the organization reported. Those students posted
a 13.8 percent gain _ from 10,325 in 1987 to 11,754 in 1988.
   The rise in minority participation comes at a time of increasing
concern over an anticipated shortfall of science and engineering
professionals. The National Science Foundation estimates that by
the year 2000, the nation will turn out 400,000 fewer scientists
and engineers than it needs.
   Council President George Campbell said the minority engineering
gains reflect changing demographics as well as efforts by several
organizations to increase minority participation in technical
fields. He said his own group spent $1.1 million over three years
on more than 20 programs designed to introduce minority students to
engineering careers and help them develop the academic skills
needed to enter the field.
   The increase in enrollments contrasts with the low rate of
minority engineering graduates, which Campbell puts at between 36
percent and 40 percent. The graduation rate nationally is 70
percent, while for Asians it is 100 percent.
   ``There is an ongoing problem'' with blacks, Hispanics and
American Indians leaving the field, Campbell said, adding there has
been some recent progress in retaining those students from their
freshman to sophomore to junior years. ``We can't count them as
having been retained until they graduate,'' he said.
   ``But we have seen fewer freshmen dropping out than in previous
years so in 1989, 1990 and 1991 we expect to see some improvement
in retention rates,'' Campbell said.
   A plethora of reports from teachers, corporations, universities,
associations and government agencies have cited the need to improve
math and science education in the lower grades and generate more
interest among women and minorities, who make up a growing
proportion of the nation's work force.
   According to the action council, one out of three Americans will
be non-white by the turn of the century, but only 6 percent of
annual engineering graduates currently are black, Hispanic or
American Indian.
   Citing data from the Engineering Manpower Commission, the
council said American Indians made the most dramatic percentage
gain in freshman enrollment from 1987 to 1988, up 22.3 percent from
354 to 433. Blacks also showed a substantial increase, up 15.1
percent compared with a 4.6 boost the year before. Hispanic
freshman enrollment increased 11 percent, slightly less than a 13.9
percent hike from 1986 to 1987.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The court-appointed bankruptcy examiner for
Eastern Airlines is expected to report at a hearing today that no
viable offers have been made for the airline, The New York Times
reported in today's editions.
   Miami-based Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
from its creditors March 9, five days after the start of a strike
by the Machinists union that has been supported by pilots and
flight attendants.
   David I. Shapiro was appointed by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
R. Lifland in New York as an examiner to help reorganize the
carrier, which is a division of Texas Air Corp. of Houston.
   The Times, citing anonymous sources, said Shapiro will report
today that no acceptable buyout bids for the carrier have been
received.
   The lack of an offer deemed acceptable by Shapiro is expected to
reduce the leverage of Eastern's three main unions in their
3-month-old strike.
   The unions recently have supported proposed buyout proposals
from two investor groups, one led by former Piedmont Airlines
chairman William Howard and the other by Chicago commodities trader
Joseph Ritchie. Shapiro has challenged the two groups to put at
least $100 million of their own cash at risk.
   Management, on the other hand, is proceeding with a plan to
rebuild Eastern as a smaller carrier and sell $1.8 billion of its
assets.
   Eastern on Wednesday announced an expanded schedule that it said
will allow the company to recall by July more than 1,700 non-union
workers placed on ``no work'' status when the airline curtailed
service shortly after the strike started.
   Eastern said it has 5,000 employees now and eventually will have
about 17,000, compared with a pre-strike total of about 30,000.
   Eastern said it will expand from 79 daily flights in June to 221
in July, the company's largest increase in service since the strike
began.
   The airline said it would offer bargain fares of $39 to $139 on
domestic tickets, including a one-way New York-Miami fare of $79
and $59 between New York and Atlanta. The only requirement is a
three-day advance purchase.
   Eastern said it also will offer first-class tickets at $10 below
the normal full coach fare to attract business travelers.
   ``Because of the turmoil here, we'll need to use price as an
incentive to get customers to try us again,'' said company
spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami.

<HEAD>FDA Says Long Term Wearing Of Contact Lens Can Injure Eyes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is asking
contact lens manufacturers to warn people who wear soft contact
lenses for more than a week without cleaning them that they run the
risk of eye disease.
   Certified letters mailed Wednesday by the FDA asked the
manufacturers to prepare labels instructing patients not to wear
the soft extended-wear or disposable lenses for more than seven
days because of an increased risk of developing ulcerative
keratitis, a disease that can cause blindness.
   The FDA also sent letters to 60,000 eye doctors, alerting them
to the labeling change.
   Manufacturers have 45 days to comply with the FDA request.
   Dr. Richard E. Lippman of the FDA said that the new labeling
will apply only to the soft lenses, but he said rigid extended-wear
lenses already are labeled to limit continuous wear to seven days.
   ``This means that no lens sold in the U.S. should be worn
continuously longer than seven days,'' he said. ``People should be
aware that proper lens care is extremely important and great care
should be taken in the weekly cleaning.''
   The target of the warnings are soft contact lenses that are
marketed with instructions that permit continuous wear for up to 30
days, and soft lenses that are marketed as extended-wear
disposables.
   A study sponsored by the Contact Lens Institute, an organization
of the six largest manufacturers of extended-wear lenses, showed
that the risk of ulcertative keratitis is about five times greater
for extended wear contact users than for those who use daily wear
lenses.
   FDA commissioner Frank E. Young said the data from the study
``did not identify a wearing time that will eliminate the risk
altogether, but seven days represents a relatively short,
easy-to-remember interval which will encourage users to remove
their lenses and clean them.''
   Some eye experts believe even seven days between cleanings is
too long, and that any lens worn more than one day without proper
hygiene increases the risk of eye disease.
   ``We do not recommend extended-wear lenses, except in some
circumstances'' such as elderly people who cannot perform the daily
lens-cleaning routine, said Dr. Michael A. Lemp, head of the center
for eyesight at Georgetown University Hospital. ``In my view if the
risk-benefit is based only on convenience, it is not acceptable.''
   Ulcerative kertitis is a general term for the formation of an
ulcer or open sore on the cornea, the clear covering of the eye
which is essential to vision. The ulcer is thought to be caused by
bacteria or parasites that attach themselves to contact lens.
   The can come on quite suddenly, said Lemp. The symptoms included
tearing, pain which can be intense, sensitivity to light, and
decreased vision.
   If a contact lens wearer experiences such symtoms, he said, they
should ``immediately remove the lens and immediately seek medical
treatment.''
   The disease is usually treated with topical antibiotics.

<HEAD>Nuclear Plant Shut Down After Leak Discovered</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLINTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear power plant was shut down early
today after a faulty seal in a pump spilled hundreds of gallons of
slightly radioactive water around the base of the reactor,
officials said.
   No injuries were reported and no radiation was released to the
environment, Illinois Power Co. spokesman Frank Beman said. ``Our
workers and the public were never in danger. It was an orderly
shutdown.''
   The low-level radioactive leak prompted plant officials to call
an alert, Nuclear Regulatory Commission spokesman Frank Ingram
said. That was downgraded to an ``unusual event'' 24 minutes later,
he said from the NRC's Rockville, Md., headquarters. By 3:25 a.m.,
the plant was reported back on normal status.
   Beman said only about 10 such alerts are issued each year by
nuclear power plants.
   It was the first such incident at the Clinton plant, which came
into full operation last year. The plant was restarted May 27 after
being down for refueling and was operating at about 40 percent of
capacity at the time of today's problem.
   The pump which leaked feeds water into the reactor, where it is
heated into steam that spins turbines and powers the generators.
   ``The water collected in a well at the base (of the reactor) and
we're going to start cleanup as soon as we can,'' Beman said. ``The
cleanup should be completed by this weekend, then we'll repair the
pump and expect to be back up in a few days.''
   Beman said he could not be more specific about the plant's
return to operation. Clinton is the only nuclear power plant
operated by Illinois Power and provides one-third of the
electricity used by the Decatur-based utility's half-million
customers in central Illinois.

   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has joined a bid by Los
Angeles investor Alfred Checchi to buy NWA Inc., the parent of
Northwest Airlines, a KLM spokesman confirmed today.
   NWA stock rose $1.37{ to $108.75 today in early composite New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   KLM has ``a commitment to an American investment group headed by
Mr. Alfred Checchi to take an indirect interest in a company to be
formed by Mr. Checchi that will issue a bid for Northwest
Airlines,'' spokesman Peter Wellhuener said.
   Wellhuener refused any further comment, citing the
confidentiality of the agreement between Checchi, a former hotel
executive, and KLM, which is based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
   The other bidders for St. Paul, Minn.-based NWA are Pan Am
Corp., which has offered about $110 a share, or $3.3 billion, and
Marvin Davis, the billionaire Los Angeles investor.
   The size of the bids by Davis and Checchi were not known.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the leveraged buyout specialist,
is also rumored as a possible bidder for NWA.
   Checchi is a former Marriott Corp. executive and was associated
with the Bass brothers' investment operations. He has two other
former Marriott executives as partners: Walt Disney Co.'s chief
financial officer, Gary Wilson, and Washington investment banker
Fred Malek.
   The group also includes Elders IXL Ltd., a diversified
Australian company.

<HEAD>Father, Son Charged With Insider Trading In Lucky Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A father-son duo was charged with insider
trading in an alleged scheme that netted $328,844 in stock-trading
profits ahead of American Stores Co.'s takeover of Lucky Stores
Inc. last year.
   David Hellberg, a financial specialist with American Stores unit
Alpha Beta, was accused by the federal government Wednesday of
tipping off his father, Gerald Hellberg last March about the plans
to buy Lucky.
   The elder Hellberg used the information to buy Lucky stock
options, then sold the securities at a large profit when the
takeover plans were announced, the Securities and Exchange
Commission charged.
   The pair deny the charges.
   ``I believe the charges are without merit, and I intend to
defend them vigorously,'' said David Hellberg, reached by phone in
Salt Lake City. His father, a Salt Lake City retiree, also denied
the allegations.
   In a suit filed in federal District Court, the SEC said American
Stores officials had asked David Hellberg to prepare a computer
program to forecast the financial effects of acquiring the rival
Lucky chain.
   The government alleges that the younger Hellberg knew of
American Stores' takeover plans by March 13, 1987, and tipped off
his father by telephone that same day.
   Two months later Lucky agreed to be acquired by American Stores
for $2.5 billion.
   The elder Hellberg allegedly purchased some $15,049 in Lucky
stock options, whose value soared as much as 25-fold after plans
for the takeover were announced, the SEC alleges.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Edges Up 0.1 Percent in April</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending, propped up by an
increase in work on government projects, edged up a slim 0.1
percent in April after dropping in the previous three months, the
Commerce Department said today.
   Overall, spending on both public and private construction
projects rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $414.9
billion in April after dropping 0.3 percent in March, 0.6 percent
in February and 0.7 percent in January.
   The January-March string of declines had marked the first time
construction spending dropped three times in a row since it fell
for five straight months from February through June 1981, just
before the start of the 1981-82 recession.
   The construction industry has been among the sectors of the
economy hardest hit in recent months by the Federal Reserve's
campaign to push up interest rates to slow economic growth and thus
restrain inflation.
   April's spending level was 4.7 percent above the pace in April
1988.
   Spending on public construction projects rose 5.7 percent in
April to a seasonally adjusted $79.3 billion. The increase included
an 8.9 percent rise in construction on highways and streets, the
biggest government category.
   The increase in spending on government projects barely offset
declines in private construction of both residential and
non-residential buildings.
   Spending on private, non-residential construction projects fell
4.8 percent in April to an annual rate of $97.2 billion, reflecting
a downturn in spending on offices, motels and hotels, hospitals,
and other commercial buildings.
   Construction of new housing units, meanwhile, fell 1.3 percent
to an annual rate of $141.8 billion after falling 1.2 percent in
March. Spending on single-family homes dropped 2.3 percent, while
construction of multi-family units rose 2.9 percent.

uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's next move in setting its
credit policy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.58 to 2,482.72 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
324 up, 509 down and 484 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22 million shares as of 10 a.m.

   Hopes have been increasing for some time in the financial world
that the Federal Reserve might soon begin to ease credit, seeking
to cushion a slowing economy against the risk of recession.
   But some doubts have been voiced lately about the likelihood and
prospective timing of any such action.
   The picture of a dropoff in the pace of business was blurred a
bit Wednesday by reports showing strength in factory orders and the
index of leading economic indicators in April.
   The Fed's strategy may be strongly influenced, analysts said, by
the monthly statistics due out Friday on the employment situation
in May.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Motors rose [ to 40{;
General Electric was unchanged at 54|, and American Telephone &

institute a ``poison pill'' shareholder rights plan.
   Dunkin' Donuts owns or franchises 1,780 shops around the world.
It reported earnings of $13.5 million on sales of $112.8 million

   The disposable diaper, that grand convenience
for new parents, now looms as an environmental threat. Each year,
landfills bury 16 billion of them, loaded with chemicals and human
waste and neatly wrapped in impermeable plastic. They may remain
intact indefinitely. The first story in a two-part project, ``Dirty
Diapers,'' reports on the problems of disposable diapers in
America's waste stream. Tomorrow's story examines the $3.5 billion
diaper industry and the growing pressure on it to make changes.

   Snigger if you will, but Carl Lehrburger sees nothing funny
about disposable diapers in the garbage.
   ``Once people get over the frivolousness of the subject, they
will begin to comprehend the sheer magnitude of the problem,'' said
Lehrburger, an Albany, N.Y., recycling expert who crusades against
what he calls single-use diapers.
   Lehrburger warns that products with such comforting names as
Pampers, Huggies and Luvs are ecological booby traps, clogging the
nation's landfills with an unhealthy legacy of indestructible,
urine-soaked, feces-bearing, plastic-and-paper time capsules.
   ``Our job is to potty train society in terms of how we handle
our waste,'' he said.
   Toss-away diapers transformed infant care when they were
introduced 27 years ago. An onerous task became easier, cleaner and
less time-consuming. Families with infants and young children could
travel with ease. An entire generation has matured never knowing
the pricks of diaper pins or odor of diaper pails.
   But now the wonder product is under scrutiny for what happens
after it leaves baby's bottom. Last month Nebraska banned the sale
of non-biodegradable diapers, effective in 1993. Lawmakers have
debated disposable diapers in Iowa, Oregon and Washington.
   Although landfill managers and environmental officials worry
more about heavy metals and other toxic wastes leaking into ground
water, there is a growing awareness that disposable diapers
contribute mightily to what is known in the garbage trade as the
``waste stream.''
   Best estimates say disposables account for a relatively small
1-2 percent of the nation's refuse each year. But disposables can
be disposed of only by burning or burial. As a greater percentage
of discarded paper, plastic, bottles and cans is recycled, the
problems posed by disposable diapers will become more significant.
   ``I wouldn't put diapers right at the top of my priority list.
I'm more worried about car batteries. But we are concerned about
them,'' said Edward Klein, deputy director of the Environmental
Protection Agency's Municipal Waste Program. ``There are a lot of
unanswered questions about them.''
   Challenges to disposable diapers spring not only from selfless
concern about the environment. Lehrburger's research is financed by
a cotton diaper industry campaigning to recapture its market. The
sponsors of the Nebraska law noted that since biodegradable diapers
use plastic made from cornstarch, what might be good for the
environment might also be good for corn farmers.
   Nevertheless, the disposable diaper presents several specific
problems of contamination and decomposition.
   The main environmental worry is numerical. More than 16 billion
used diapers went from nurseries to landfills last year. Two
billion more were incinerated.
   By volume, 16 billion used diapers would blanket 25 football
fields _ and reach 30 stories high. If measured by approximate
weight, that many diapers could fill up the wandering garbage barge
of 1987 every six hours for 322 consecutive days.
   The diaper industry says the 18 billion diaper total amounts to
half of 1 percent of the 160 million tons of garbage accumulated
last year. Lehrburger puts it around 2 percent of the total and
says that would make diapers the third largest single product in
the American trash pile, behind newspapers and containers for food
and beverages.
   ``When you have a product that has a life of maybe a few hours
and ends up constituting 2 percent of our municipal solid waste, it
is not an insignificant number,'' he said.
   Another problem is that disposable diapers cannot be recycled,
for reasons less obvious than what babies deposit in them. While 60
percent of a disposable diaper is wood pulp and fluff that would
normally decompose easily, this is enclosed in an armor of plastic
that can keep it intact indefinitely.
   ``Disposable diapers are a combination of paper fiber and
plastic and human waste, so that is a difficult product to deal
with,'' said Jay Shephard, a supervisor in the Washington state
Department of Ecology.
   In addition, the ``ultra'' absorbent disposable diapers contain
``acrylic absorbers,'' crystals of an oil-based polymer that can
absorb up to 80 times their weight in moisture. The chemical
crystals turn into a thick gel when wet.
   The same material was used in ultra-absorbent tampons, which
were suspected of causing toxic shock syndrome. Tests performed by
the Centers for Disease Control, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found no
evidence connecting the diapers and toxic shock.
   A third factor is the contents of used diapers. Beyond the
regular diseases carried in human waste, babies' feces carry
intestinal viruses that cause polio, hepatitis and meningitis.
   ``If they get into the ground water they could contaminate the
water supply,'' said Charles Gerba, a University of Arizona
microbiologist who studies groundwater contamination. ``Whether or
not that has happened, no one really knows.''
   No immediate solution to the diaper dilemma seems clear. Several
smaller companies are marketing biodegradable diapers using
cornstarch-based plastics that break down faster than a regular
plastic shell. But not many hold out hope for that as a solution.
   ``Once these are buried in a landfill, they don't really
degrade'' because of the lack of oxygen and light, said Neil
Seldman, a waste management expert with the Institute of Local
Self-Reliance, a think tank for municipal governments based in
Washington, D.C.
   Seldman sees a time soon when municipalities and states may add
fees and taxes to the cost of disposable diapers. That has already
been done in some places with styrofoam products, to pay the cost
of handling specialized trash.
   ``We're going to see a widening disparity in the cost of
reusable and disposable products,'' he said.
   But others believe the disposable diaper, used by more than 80
percent of the nation's parents, has too strong a constituency to
challenge.
   ``You don't want mad mothers. That's the political reality of
it,'' said Bruce Walker, managing of the recycling program in
Portland, Ore.
   Washington state has given $150,000 to a pilot project that will
test ways to sterilize used diapers, then strip them into their
plastic and paper components for recycling.
   State legislator Georgette Valle said she supported the project
grant precisely because toss-away diapers are such a popular
product.
   ``I recognize the fact that parents want to use (disposable
diapers), so we have to something to get them out of the
landfill,'' she said.
   Lehrburger, whose work has been sponsored by the National
Association of Diaper Services and Di-Dee Service Inc. of Syracuse,
N.Y., talks of taxing disposables and subsidizing the cotton diaper
industry.
   But he thinks the best way to deal with disposables is
education, a role he sees falling on hospitals and day-care centers
that now use disposables.
   ``It comes down to changing public attitudes,'' he said. ``Once
they learn the consequences, there is a perception on the part of
consumers that their lifestyles are having an effect on the
environment.''

diapers, Procter &amp; Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, account for 75 percent of
the 18 billion throwaway diapers that swathe American babies' bottoms each

who claim the diapers devour landfill space and threaten ground water,

   At a recent Kimberly-Clark meeting for Wall
Street security analysts, the hard questions weren't about profits,
sales projections or stock dividends, but when to expect a
biodegradable diaper.
   Last month, the Nebraska legislature passed a bill that will
outlaw the sale of nondegradable diapers Oct. 1, 1993. Similar laws
have been discussed in Oregon, Iowa and Washington.
   For diaper makers, ``the environment has become a fairly hot
issue in the last six months,'' said Bonita Austin, who follows the
consumer product industry for the investment firm Wertheim
Schroeder &amp; Co. Further legislation would intensify pressure on
manufacturers, she said.
   The outcry has startled America's $3.5 billion diaper industry,
which first introduced the disposable a quarter-century ago and has
since found an immense market for the bundles of tissue, wood pulp,
liquid-gobbling chemicals and fancy plastic that sell for up to 25
cents apiece.
   The last thing these companies expected was an ecological
boomerang from a product that has earned enormous profits and is
still considered one of the most successful innovations ever
created.
   Lawmakers, consumers, investors and ecologists say the
disposable diaper presents an environmental threat as both a bulky
single-use product that cannot be recycled and as a potential
disease carrier.
   P&amp;G and Kimberly-Clark aren't saying exactly how they're
planning to respond, although both are believed to be working on
degradable alternatives.
   Together, the companies account for about 75 percent of the
business of disposable diapers, still embraced by a generation of
grateful parents. Luvs and Pampers are P&amp;G's largest product group,
with roughly $1.65 billion in annual domestic sales, while
Kimberly-Clark sells about $840 million worth of its Huggies each
year in the United States, analysts say.
   Despite their enormous size and marketing reach, however, the
companies have yet to respond to the growing demand for diapers
that decompose. That has left a hole smaller companies already are
filling.
   For example, RMed International Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., has
started marketing TenderCare, a non-chemical, degradable diaper the
company claims breaks down to hydrogen, oxygen and carbon in a
decade.
   ``It's not perfect, but it's a heck of a lot better than 500
years,'' said Suzanne Shelton-Foley, RMed's vice president of
marketing.
   Sales have gone from zero to 40,000 boxes a month since the
company introduced them five months ago, which is considered
remarkably strong since most are sold in health-food stores or over
the telephone.
   TenderCare covers contain a plastic that is 6 percent
cornstarch. This innovation not only accelerates the decomposition
process but has also won support from the National Corn Growers
Association, which sees a sprawling new market for corn.
   The association joined forces with environmentalists to lobby
for the Nebraska law.
   In 1987, the diaper industry used 177 million pounds of plastic.
``That would mean millions of bushels of corn!'' enthused Tim
Draeger, the association's marketing development assistant.
   Some experts say diaper makers could easily convert to
starch-impregnated plastics. But manufacturers counter that they
would have to use considerably more of that material to make a
sufficiently strong outer cover.
   The diaper giants maintain that the technology to make a truly
degradable plastic isn't available.
   ``They're definitely working on it, but I don't think it's
imminent,'' said Austin, the securities analyst. ``It's not the
easiest technological gap to hurdle, and they can't make the claim
unless the diaper is truly degradable.''
   P&amp;G spokesman T. Scott Stewart said the company has found no
evidence that cornstarch-based plastics quickly degrade if buried
in modern landfills, partly because conventional decomposition
requires light and oxygen.
   Kimberly-Clark is ``spending a lot of time and effort to find a
substitute for the plastic components that would readily degrade in
a landfill environment,'' said spokeswoman Tina Barry.
   A small but growing number of environmentally sensitized
consumers are rejecting any disposable diaper, biodegradable or
not. They're turning back to reusable cloth.
   ``There's a heightened consciousness among the enlightened
people of this country that we cannot go on trashing our world,''
said Jeff Johnston, head of Tiny Tots Diaper Service in Saginaw,
Mich., and president of the National Diaper Service Association.
   Over the last few months, Johnston said, his business is up 35
percent, and he estimated services around the country are
experiencing similar surges.
   Cloth diapers account for 10 to 15 percent of all the diapers
used. Energized by the growing demand, the diaper service
association plans to spend $120,000 on advertising next year,
promoting cotton diapers as an alternative.
   That's a lot of money for the diaper assocation, but nothing
compared with the megabudgets for advertising and promotion spent
by P&amp;G and Kimberly-Clark, which are expected continue to boost
their products vigorously even if they're quietly researching
alternatives.
   The big diaper companies oppose legislation that would ban or
restrict non-degradable disposables, since by their reckoning these
products account for less than 1 percent of solid waste in the
country.
   Moreover, the diaper giants are giving no outward indication
they plan to shrink their lines of disposables because of the
environmental issue. On the contrary, they've been expanding them
with gimmicks that range from elasticized waistbands to Mickey
Mouse designs on the plastic linings.
   Kimberly-Clark appears to have the latest edge, using technology
that allows fluid to flow in only one direction. The company claims
this ensures diapers stay dry for hours after they're soiled. It
also has introduced disposable training pants called Pull-Ups that
sell for about 50 cents each.
   Barry characterized claims by such small companies as RMed as
``grandiose. ... We're not going to jump on that bandwagon. What
people care about with a disposable diaper is performance, and it
has gained in popularity as the quality improved.''
   Nonetheless, she said, if degradability ``becomes something the
majority of consumers desire, it's certainly something we would
have to respond to.''

<HEAD>Computer Architect Says His Dream Isn't a Trade Barrier</HEAD>

   Ken Sakamura dreams of a future in which billions
of compatible computers link together the world's people, creating
understanding and peace.
   But the U.S. government says his new basic computer design,
named Tron, may be an unfair trade barrier that restricts U.S.
access to the Japanese market.
   Sakamura, a 37-year-old computer scientist at the University of
Tokyo, says such charges are a misunderstanding.
   ``In the current climate of trade friction, anything new and
Japanese is considered an economic threat by people in other
countries,'' he says. ``It's very sad because it overlooks how Tron
can help all the people of the world both economically and
culturally.''
   Tron escaped being named as a major trade barrier in the U.S.
Trade Representative's report last week that focused on Japanese
policy on imports of supercomputers, forestry products and
satellites, but Tron remains a matter of concern to U.S. officials
and computer firms.
   Sakamura says he created Tron, a computer ``architecture'' or
basic set of operating specifications, to make future computers
more compatible and flexible, and has offered it free of charge to
anyone.
   With Tron, he says, computer operations would become as
standardized as the controls in cars, giving anyone the ability to
operate virtually any computer.
   Tron, which stands for The Real-time Operating System Nucleus,
also would allow future homes and offices to have dozens of
computers linked together in a single network, while houses and
communities could be connected into ``intelligent cities,'' he says.
   In a Tron ``intelligent house,'' Sakamura says, if the volume of
the stereo system is turned up, a miniature computer could notify
another computer, which would close the windows to avoid disturbing
the neighbors. That computer would then inform a microcomputer in
the air conditioner, which would turn on to keep the temperature
from rising.
   Outside, computers could sense a child crossing the street and
tell computers in oncoming cars to stop, he says.
   Sakamura isn't alone in his dream. In the past year, 126
computer-related companies, including 18 foreign firms, have joined
the Tron Association, which promotes his design. The list includes
most of the world's leading semiconducter makers.
   Six Japanese manufacturers are currently developing advanced
32-bit Tron microprocessors, and the first full Tron computer is
expected in 1991.
   A Tron ``intelligent house'' currently under construction in
Tokyo by a group of 16 companies is slated to contain 380 computers
and be completed by the end of this year. The rice cooker, lights,
telephones, baths, videocassette recorders, air conditioners,
stereo equipment and a host of other appliances are tied together
in a computer network for easy control.
   A 12-story, $35 million Tron ``intelligent building'' planned in
Tokyo will incorporate more than 10,000 interlinked microcomputers,
developers say.
   Dwarfing those projects is a computerized Tron ``city'' planned
by 20 companies in Chiba prefecture outside of Tokyo. About 1,000
people are expected to live in the 250-acre area, expected to cost
about $715 million to build.
   The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, in its preliminary
report on trade restrictons, said moves to adopt the Tron standard
in Japan could hurt sales of U.S. computers and give Japanese
companies an unfair advantage.
   While Japanese makers have developed Tron products, ``no U.S.
manufacturer is in a position to sell Tron-based PCs (personal
computers) or telecommunications equipment,'' it said.
   In recent negotiations in Japan, U.S. trade officials said they
were particularly concerned that Japanese government procurements
that specified the Tron standard would place U.S. companies at a
disadvantage.
   In January, Japan's semi-private telecommunications giant,
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., announced it will use the
Tron standard for its future digital communications network.
   A committee formed by Japanese government, industry and local
educational agencies also has set specifications for purchases of
school computers which may give an advantage to Tron equipment, the
U.S. trade report said.
   But, says Sakamura, ``Tron's basic philosophy is openness, so
anyone can use Tron specifications at no charge.''
   Ironically, some analysts attribute Japanese companies'
enthusiasm for Tron in part to restrictions that U.S. semiconductor
makers have placed on Japanese use of U.S.-developed computer
microprocessors.
   A U.S. electronics industry source says American officials also
fear that Tron could replace U.S.-developed operating systems such
as UNIX and MS-DOS, and thereby reduce U.S. leadership in the
industry.
   The industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
some U.S. companies might feel it was ``too much of an imposition''
to adjust to Tron.
   Sakamura says all computer and software firms would benefit if
Tron is widely adopted because their products could sell anywhere,
including Japan, without modifications.
   But he says Tron's greatest contribution will be in allowing the
people of the world to communicate more easily.
   Tron provides for 48,400 multilingual characters as well as the
direct transfer of images, while the current ASCII standard for
transferring data between computers provides for only 128 Roman
letters, numbers and symbols.
   ``Hopefully a new world economic order will develop around this
new culture and communication order, creating the foundation for
cooperation and less fighting among peoples,'' Sakamura says.
   ``That may sound like a dream. ... However, I'm a computer
architect, and the more I dream about the future, the better I can
do my job of designing computer architecture for it.''

<HEAD>Revised Figures Show Productivity Drop; Greater Gain In Labor Costs</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS graf 6 to CORRECT 5.4 percent to 5.2 percent; moved general
news wires also.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Productivity in the non-farm business sector
of the economy fell at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the first
quarter, helping trigger a significant increase in unit labor
costs, the government reported today.
   The Labor Department's revised data for first-quarter
productivity should prove disturbing to analysts who have said
improved output per hour by American workers is essential to curb
inflation and make up for labor shortages in some fields.
   The government in May had reported productivity, on a seasonally
adjusted annual rate, rose 0.5 percent in the first three months of
1989 compared to the final quarter of 1988. That report also listed
a 5.2 percent increase, at an annual rate as well, in unit labor
costs for the first quarter.
   But revised data released today showed productivity declined at
an annual rate of 1.1 percent as output rose 2.2 percent while
hours worked climbed 3.4 percent from the prior quarter.
   That compared to a 1.0 percent gain in productivity on an annual
basis n the fourth quarter of 1988 and a 1.5 percent gain reported
for all of last year.
   Unit labor costs rose 6.6 percent in the quarter on an annual
basis, up from the 5.2 percent reported in the preliminary data in
May and higher still than the 4.1 percent increase reported in the
fourth quarter of 1988.
   The jump in unit labor costs reflected the decline in
productivity and a 5.4 percent increase, on an annual basis, of
hourly wages in the quarter. That figure was revised downward from
the previously reported 5.7 percent but was still up from the 5.2
percent annual increase reported for the fourth quarter and the 4.6
percent jump for all of 1988.
   But the data showed consumer inflation continues to erode the
wage gains made by workers.
   Although hourly pay on average climbed 5.4 percent on an annual
basis in the first quarter, real hourly compensation was unchaged
because consumer prices rose at the same rate as wages.
   In the manufacturing sector, productivity in the first quarter
rose 2.1 percent on an annual basis, down from the 3.8 percent gain
reported in May's preliminary data. Revised data showed output rose
2.8 percent in that sector while hours worked climbed by 0.7
percent. Unit labor costs in manufacturing rose a revised 2.0
percent in the first quarter on an annual basis.
   Th sector reporting the most significant productivity declines
was non-financial corporations, which reported a 1.3 percent drop
in output per hour in the first quarter. That figure was unchanged
from the previous data but the downward revisions in other sectors
brought overall non-farm productivity into a decline.
   In the overall business sector, which includes agriculture,
productivity was up 1.7 percent in the first quarter at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate, down from the 3.5 percent gain
reported in May's early data for the first quarter.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down 50-Year Federal Ban On Beer Contents Listing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge here has struck down a 50-year
federal ban on listing the alcohol content of beer on bottles and
cans in a First Amendment challenge brought by Adolph Coors Co.
   U.S. District Judge Zita Weinshienk's ruling on Wednesday
cleared the way for the Golden brewer to list the alcohol content
of its products.
   ``Coors felt this was a right consumers have and that they ought
to be able to be told what the alcohol content is in whatever
beverage they are drinking,'' said Coors spokesman Neil Peters.
   Coors has been trying to emphasize through advertising that beer
is the alcoholic beverage of moderation and that its beer does not
contain less alcohol than its competitors.
   Coors, the nation's fourth-largest brewer, had filed a lawsuit
against the Treasury Department over a law passed in the 1930s
during the post-Prohibition era.
   When it approved the Federal Alcohol Administration Act,
Congress was reacting to fears that brewers would try to boost
sales by touting their beer as stronger. The ban does not apply to
distilled liquor and wines, which routinely list their alcohol
content.
   Coors' lawsuit contended the ban violated Coors' right to free
speech under the First Amendment.
   Coors' challenge was not opposed by the executive branch of the
federal government, but the U.S. House of Representatives joined
the case as a defendant.
   Congressional attorney Janina Jaruzelski had contended that
repealing the ban would lead to ``misleading'' information, but
Weinshienk rejected that argument.

   The stock market managed some spotty gains today
as traders tried to sort out the Federal Reserve's next move in
setting its credit policy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.25 to 2,486.39 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 608 up, 535
down and 596 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 56.49 million shares at
midmorning.
   Hopes have been increasing for some time in the financial world
that the Federal Reserve might soon begin to ease credit, seeking
to cushion a slowing economy against the risk of recession.
   But some doubts have been voiced lately about the likelihood and
prospective timing of any such action.
   The picture of a dropoff in the pace of business was blurred a
bit Wednesday by reports showing strength in factory orders and the
index of leading economic indicators in April.
   The Fed's strategy may be strongly influenced, analysts said, by
the monthly statistics due out Friday on the employment situation
in May.
   Gainers among ther blue chips included USX, up { at 35];

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade
following a night of steady rain in the upper Midwest.
   The showers were moving south, and more rain was predicted for
the region, which was good news for corn and soybean growers but
bearish for the markets.
   A National Weather Service 6-to-10-day outlook issued after the
close of trading Wednesday helped to further dampen fears of a
recurrence of last year's drought. The agency predicted normal
rainfall for the Corn Belt for the five days beginning Tuesday.
   Prices for near-term deliveries of soybeans were off more
sharply than those for fall, or new-crop deliveries, an indication
that traders were taking profits after several weeks of selling the
new-crop contracts and buying the old crop.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.86{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents
to 2{ cents lower with July at $2.59 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents
to 2{ cents lower with July at $1.64} a bushel; soybeans were 2{
cents to 5 cents lower with July at $7.09 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent to .35 cent higher with June at 69.07
cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .33 cent higher with
August at 76.70 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent to .18 cent
higher with June at 48.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.15 cent to .23 cent higher with July at 30.05 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Wednesday while pork futures
advanced.

<HEAD>MAI Basic Lowers Offer For Prime Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MAI Basic Four Inc. lowered its offer for Prime
Computer Inc. today and said it had firm commitments of financing
needed to complete the deal.
   Although the offer was lower than the old one, which was valued
at about $970 million, investors apparently thought it was more
credible.
   Prime was up 37{ cents a share at $16.75 in early composite New
York Stock Exchange trading today after gaining 25 cents a share on
Wednesday.
   Prime said it was evaluating the offer.
   The new offer is $19.50 a share in cash for the 49.5 million
shares of Prime currently outstanding, plus securities with a face
value of $21 a share for other shares of Prime that could be issued
through the exercise of options.
   The old offer was $20 a share, all in cash, for all shares.
Investors are likely to value the paper portion of the offer at
less than the stated $21 a share, so it is hard to put a total
value on the new offer.
   MAI Basic, a computer maker based in Tustin, Calif., has been
pursuing Prime since November. It is about a fourth the size of
Prime, a maker of minicomputers and computer-aided design equipment
based in Natick, Mass.
   MAI Basic came up with the new, lower bid after Prime last month
challenged it to come up with financing for the old bid or drop it.
   Bennett S. LeBow, the chairman of MAI Basic, said it lowered the
bid because Prime's earnings projections had worsened and Prime had
created potentially expensive employee-benefit and pension plans,
known as ``golden parachutes.''
   MAI Basic said its $1.4 billion backing for the new bid
consisted of $550 million from Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.,
$400 million from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, $300 million
from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and $150 million from Brooke Partners LP.
   The money would go to pay off old debts, buy Prime and provide
working capital for the combined company.

<HEAD>UAW Boss Owen Bieber: Union Man Who Sits on Chrysler's Board</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the telephone on Owen F. Bieber's desk
rings, it could be a retired autoworker wondering about a pension
payment. It could just as easily be Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
Iacocca.
   The 6-foot-5, 250-pound president of the United Auto Workers
union cuts a dominating figure as leader of 1 million laborers in
one of the most competitive U.S. manufacturing industries.
   But his authority is facing a simmering challenge from
dissidents who claim he's too chummy with the Big Three bosses and
has forsaken the union's historical role as militant defender of
workers rights.
   Although Bieber expects re-election at the UAW convention later
this month, he's concerned about what he calls the misguided
motives of the ``New Directions'' opposition faction led by St.
Louis activist Jerry Tucker.
   ``We've always prided ourselves in being a union that has
encouraged debate,'' he said in an interview. ``We have difficulty
and we have problems, and I speak out when there are people who,
under the guise of some of those things, really are out attacking
the union, hurting the union.''
   In his six years as leader of the UAW, Bieber has guided it into
uncharted territory, responding to what he's called the rapidly
changing economic landscape that has reshaped the relationships
between companies and unions.
   Bieber has helped establish joint labor-management programs on
the assembly line aimed at meeting the competition from foreign
automakers. He's pushed the union into organizing drives outside
the auto industry, signing members who range from nurses to police
to jai-alai ballplayers.
   Perhaps more importantly, Bieber sits on the board of Chrysler,
elbow-to-elbow with Iacocca and 17 other pinstriped directors, a
relationship once unthinkable in the volatile, sometimes violent
history of the autoworkers.
   ``I'm the only voice there who comes from the other side of the
street, so to speak,'' he said. ``They tend to think alike because
they are alike.
   ``I'm smart enough to know that unless everybody lost their
senses, including Lee Iacocca, it's not going to come down to the
situation where I'm going to win a raw vote. After all, it's
18-to-1.
   ``Even when you get beat 18-1, you have an opportunity to get
your message across.''
   Bieber, 59, joined UAW Local 687 in 1948 at McInerney Spring and
Wire Co. in Grand Rapids, Mich., 12 years after the union was born
during the bloody sit-in protests at General Motors Corp. plants
across the state in Flint.
   During the 1960s, while still working in southwest Michigan, he
helped organize workers in his home state and in northern Indiana
and Illinois. At the time, many business were leaving cities to
avoid unions and heading to his region, which was dogged by high
unemployment.
   They would use fear of a job loss to entice people to stay away
from the union, Bieber said. In response, UAW recruiters would talk
with workers intensively, trying to convince them that what
managers were doing was illegal.
   In some cases, the union would take companies before the
National Labor Relations Board.
   ``They made no bones in those days about saying to people `Hey,
we came up here from Detroit to get away from the union and high
wages, now if you get union here, we'll move back to Detroit,'''
Bieber said.
   ``Now and then, they'd pull up stakes and move to another part
of the state or maybe move over the Indiana line, all violations of
the law,'' Bieber said. ``You clipped them in those days.
   ``We used to get some pretty healthy back payments and so on
because the board did enforce the law. Today, you're tied up three
or four or five years.
   ``It takes a lot of fortitude on the part of people.''
   Bieber has never avoided a political scrap, inside or outside
the union. A picture of South African Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu,
the Nobel laureate and anti-apartheid activist, hangs on Bieber's
wall with a handwritten message: ``Thank you for your support. God
bless you.''
   When asked if he saw any difference between the Reagan and Bush
administrations, Bieber looked puzzled.
   ``I don't know what President Bush's program is,'' he said. ``He
has not laid one out.''
   He singled out Bush's handling of strike at Eastern Airlines,
saying the president missed an opportunity to show leadership by
appointing a commission to mediate the dispute, now 3 months old.
   Bieber also criticized what he described as the Republican White
House's double standard on organized labor domestically and
overseas. He mentioned the re-emergence of the Solidarity union in
Poland as an example.
   ``President Bush has spoken out affirmatively on behalf of
Solidarity and I'm happy for that,'' he said. ``I just wish he
would recognize that a flourishing union in the United States of
America would be just as important here as a flourishing union in
Poland will indeed be to that country, its economy and its standard
of living.''

that the Federal Reserve might soon begin to ease credit, seeking

the monthly statistics due out Friday on the employment situation

<HEAD>Productivity Declines, Labor Costs Rise; Inflation Still on the Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The productivity of American workers slipped
in the first quarter while unit labor costs shot up more than 6
percent on an annual basis, the government said Thursday in a
report analysts cited as proof both of a slowing economy and
stubborn inflation.
   The Labor Department's revised figures for the first three
months of the year showed a 1.1 percent decline in non-farm
business productivity at an annual rate, down from the 0.5 percent
gain reported in preliminary first-quarter data issued last month.
   Unit labor costs _ a key determinant of overall inflation _ rose
a revised 6.6 percent on an annual basis in the quarter, said the
government, which in the earlier report had pegged the increase at
5.2 percent.
   In other economic data Thursday, the government reported a slim,
0.1 percent increase in construction spending in April after three
straight monthly declines. The improvement in that sector, among
those hardest hit by higher interest rates, was attributed largely
to work on government projects.
   The reports were in line with other data indicating a
significant slowdown in the rate of economic expansion in the first
quarter followed by somewhat improved growth in the first two
months of the second quarter. Analysts expect Friday's unemployment
report for May to put a more definitive stamp on second-quarter
trends.
   ``The economy is slowing down but it's certainly not stopping,''
said chief economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw-Hill of Lexington,
Mass.
   The 1.1 percent decline in productivity compared with a 1
percent annual gain in the fourth quarter of 1988 and an overall
1988 gain of 1.5 percent. It was the first decline in productivity
since a sharp drop of 2.4 percent on an annual basis in the second
quarter of last year. The revised data said the 1.1 percent decline
resulted from a 2.2 percent increase in output but a greater
increase, 3.4 percent, in the total hours worked.
   The jump in unit labor costs was the biggest since the second
quarter of last year as well; the government at that time reported
a 6.8 percent increase on an annual basis. For all of 1988 unit
labor costs rose 3.1 percent.
   The revised numbers were not entirely unexpected.
   Last week's downward revision of the gross national product for
the first quarter brought predictions that the productivity gain
reported in May's preliminary data was erroneous.
   Still, the rate of decline was surprising to some analysts and
of greater concern was the inflationary pressures demonstrated by
the big jump in labor costs.
   ``The results are distinctly inflationary,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist for Boston Co. Economic Advisers Inc. ``The true
core of inflation in the United States is really unit labor costs.
... This is indeed a dismal statement and makes the outlook for a
quick and accelerated reduction in inflation very, very poor.''
   Analysts who for some time have been raising alarms about
sluggish productivity gains took Thursday's report as further
evidence that major reductions in the trade deficit will not come
until U.S. business makes a substantial commitment to improving
productivity, which in turn would reduce unit labor costs.
   At the same time, however, they said declining productivity as
reported Thursday would slice profit margins and make business less
willing to make capital investments in equipment and training
needed to bolster productivity. And they said pressure on profits
would trigger price increases and exacerbate inflationary pressures.
   ``Lack of productivity is one of the major problems in this
country,'' said Washington-based economist Michael Evans. ``This is
not the first bad report we've had although it's the worst in some
time. ... The inflationary pressures are starting to creep up
again.''
   Sinai said the continued evidence of inflationary pressures
likely would convince Federal Reserve policy-makers to continue the
central bank's current tight rein on credit despite growing
pressure to ease.
   Also in the productivity report was evidence that wage gains
made by American workers are being wiped out by consumer price
inflation.
   The Labor Department said average hourly pay climbed 5.4 percent
on an annual basis in the first quarter. But real hourly
compensation _ wage gains minus consumer price inflation _ was
unchanged compared with the fourth quarter of 1988.
   The Commerce Department's report on construction activity said
spending on both public and private construction projects rose to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $414.9 billion in April after
dropping 0.3 percent in March, 0.6 percent in February and 0.7
percent in January.
   The January-March string of declines had marked the first time
construction spending dropped three times in a row since it fell
for five straight months from February through June 1981, just
before the start of the 1981-82 recession.

<HEAD>MAI Basic Lowers Its Bid For Prime Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MAI Basic Four Inc. lowered its tender offer for
Prime Computer Inc. on Thursday by 50 cents a share and said the
offer would no longer be all cash, citing reductions in Prime's
projected results for 1989 and 1990.
   Prime temporarily removed its takeover defenses on May 15 and
challenged Tustin, Calif.-based MAI either to complete a takeover
by June 2 at its original offer of $20 cash per share, or to drop
its bid altogether.
   But one day before that deadline, MAI Chairman Bennett S. LeBow
said the offer was dropping to $19.50 cash per share for Prime's
49.5 million outstanding shares.
   MAI also said it would exchange securities with a face value of
$21 for each of 16.2 million additional shares that could be issued
to owners of Prime options and convertible bonds.
   Since investors are likely to value the paper portion of the
offer at less than the stated $21 a share, it is hard to put a
total value on the new offer. The original offer was estimated to
be worth about $970 million.
   Prime, a Natick-based maker of minicomputers and computer-aided
design equipment, said its board would meet promptly to consider
MAI's revised terms. But Prime spokesman Joseph Gavaghan said the
company had ``serious reservations'' about the offer.
   ``After six months of public statements by MAI that it was
`committed' to its $20 per share cash offer for all of Prime's
shares, MAI has now lowered its cash price, changed to a partial
offer and is offering MAI stock and bonds of questionable value for
a significant portion of Prime's fully diluted shares,'' Gavaghan
said.
   LeBow said MAI's revised offer ``represents a full and fair
price'' in light of Prime's recent lowering of revenue projections.
In a May 15 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Prime said it expected its annual revenues to increase 6 percent
this year and 9 percent in 1990, down from earlier projections of
10 percent this year and 12.2 percent next year.
   LeBow also said the revised offer was justified by ``the fact
that Prime's directors have adopted various employee benefit and
pension plans'' which MAI believes could cost up to $170 million.
   Securities analysts said the lower offer was not surprising,
because earnings and stock prices for many computer makers are down
this year and Prime has been unable to find a buyer willing to pay
more than $20 per share.
   ``It's a tease,'' said Charles M. Foundyller, president of
Daratech Inc., a market research firm in Cambridge. ``It's
basically just enough that if you're a stockholder or a board
member, you really want to think about it ... But it's probably
less than you could get a year and a half from now.''
   MAI reaffirmed its intention to wage a proxy battle for control
of Prime's board at its June 14 annual meeting if the current
directors do not agree to a takeover.
   MAI also said it had firm commitments for $1.4 billion in
financing to cover the tender offer, pay off debts and provide
working capital. Those commitments consist of $550 million from
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., $400 million from the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, $300 million from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.,
and $150 million from an MAI affiliate, Brooke Partners L.P., it
said.
   MAI, which is about one-fourth the size of Prime, owns about 1.2
million shares of Prime stock. Since it launched its hostile bid in
Nov. 15, 33.3 million shares were tendered under the $20 offer,
representing nearly 70 percent of the outstanding shares and just
under 50 percent of Prime's stock on a fully diluted basis.

<HEAD>Wall Street Execs Are `Friends' of Prosecutor Who Led Fraud Crackdown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hand that's feeding New York mayoral
candidate Rudolph Giuliani is the same one he was biting not long
ago.
   In five and a half years as Manhattan U.S. attorney, Giuliani
engineered highly public investigations of Wall Street investment
firms and denounced what he termed ``systemic'' insider trading
abuses.
   Now he's getting major campaign support from top lawyers and
executives on Wall Street, where some labeled him as a
publicity-mad zealot who abused his considerable prosecutorial
powers to crack down on securities fraud.
   ``The fact that I made a contribution to his mayoral effort has
nothing to do with his performance in any case _ or lack of
performance,'' said attorney Paul J. Curran, who butted heads with
Giuliani over an insider trading case in which an arbitrager was
handcuffed and frisked before his colleagues.
   More than 20 top executives are included in an inner circle of
about 145 ``Friends of Rudy Giuliani,'' who raised more than
$800,000 at a $500-a-plate campaign luncheon at the Waldorf Astoria
hotel this week.
   Major players from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.,
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., Salomon Brothers Inc., Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. and PaineWebber Inc. are on
the list.
   The roster also includes the head of Donaldson, Lufkin and
Jenrette Inc., one of the nation's 15 largest securities firms; two
general partners at the investment bank Lazard Freres & Co.; and a
founder of the leveraged buyout powerhouse Forstmann, Little &amp; Co.
   ``I don't think it's surprising because I think the people on
Wall Street have the same concerns as other people in the city
have,'' said Giuliani press secretary Charles Perkins. ``The
problems of crime and corruption are problems whether you work on
Wall Street or ... at a factory in the Bronx.''
   Giuliani is vying with multimillionaire businessman Ronald S.
Lauder for the Republican nomination in a bid to unseat 12-year
Democratic Mayor Edward I. Koch, who is facing challenges within
his own party.
   Many of Giuliani's pin-striped supporters said they are backing
the 44-year-old former prosecutor because he is the first strong
Republican contender for mayor in this heavily Democratic city
since John V. Lindsay in the 1960s.
   They like his tough pledge to ``take back the city'' from
violent criminals, drug dealers and ``crooked politicians who have
abandoned their oath of office.'' They want him to improve public
education because, as one Wall Street supporter said, ``I can't get
a receptionist that can type.''
   Some even say Giuliani's highly publicized campaign against
financial sleaze was just what Wall Street needed in a decade of
excess.
   ``Look, he did a job he was supposed to do,'' said Muriel
Siebert, the first woman member of the New York Stock Exchange, who
heads her own brokerage firm. ``I really feel, if you want the
truth, that we've had a hell of a lot of greed downtown.''
   Under Giuliani, who stepped down at the end of January, the
Manhattan U.S. attorney's office brought charges in more than 50
securities fraud cases, using aggressive tactics that agitated many
in the financial community.
   The most frequently cited case of excessiveness was the February
1987 arrest of Robert Freeman, a partner at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.,
and two Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. executives, one of whom was taken in
handcuffs and tears from the firm's trading floor.
   Three months later charges against the three were dropped and,
despite promises from Giuliani, no new indictments have been
brought. Giuliani has conceded that the arrests were made too soon.
   His nemesis in that case was Freeman's attorney, Curran, now a
campaign financier. Curran said the case hasn't affected his
support for Giuliani, a longtime friend and assistant prosecutor
under Curran in the mid-1970s.
   ``I do my commenting on the Freeman case in court,'' Curran said.
   ``That's Curran,'' said securities defense lawyer Stanley Arkin,
who represented one of the two Kidder executives and is not
endorsing Giuliani's cause. ``Some people have put it aside and
some haven't.''
   The latter group includes Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Kidder
Peabody and Goldman Sachs _ all major targets during Giuliani's
tenure. No one from those firms is listed as a ``Friend of Rudy
Giuliani.''
   ``We're all aware of what the criticism is,'' said Giuliani
backer Chris Randolph, a Shearson senior vice president. ``Over
time I think we will know whether there is a legitimate criticism
or not.''

<HEAD>Resurgent Inflation, Labor Unrest Threaten British Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Reagan traveled to Britain a year
ago, the country was basking in economic glory. But President
Bush's visit comes against a far different backdrop.
   Inflation and labor strikes, familiar symptoms of the 1970s
British economic disease, are putting a damper on Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's economic revolution.
   As Bush met with Mrs. Thatcher this week, London was disrupted
by its fifth 24-hour subway strike this year. BBC journalists and
technicians have curtailed television and radio programs. Dock
workers are threatening to walk away from Britain's 40 ports.
   The strikes are hardly comparable to the disruption that helped
topple the Labor Party government in 1979, and inflation is still
below the 10.3-percent level when Mrs. Thatcher took office a
decade ago.
   But Goldman Sachs International said in its monthly economic
review: ``The recent upsurge in labor unrest raises unpleasant
memories of the 1970s and must cast still more doubt on how much
the United Kingdom has really changed under Mrs. Thatcher.''
   By championing free markets, keeping a tight grip on fiscal
spending and curbing union power, Mrs. Thatcher transformed an
ailing economy into a boom that has been hailed as a miracle. Gross
domestic product grew nearly 4 percent in 1988 and is expected to
grow by up to 2.8 percent this year.
   While the strikes may be only sporadic, a more ominous threat
lies in resurgent inflation, rising interest rates and a sudden
weakening of the British pound.
   A year ago, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's sweeping
tax cuts made him the hero of his Conservative Party. Now the
British press is speculating that Mrs. Thatcher will oust him in a
Cabinet reshuffle before July, and on Wednesday the pound dipped on
rumors that he had already quit.
   A recent poll showed that the Labor Party, having dumped some of
its vote-losing defense and socialist doctrines, has a 43-percent
approval rating, two points ahead of the Conservatives.
   Experts say odds are rising that the economy will suffer a
slowdown, or what they call ``a hard landing.''
   ``Less has changed since the 1970s than might have been hoped,''
said a report by the independent National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, citing Britian's annual inflation rate, which
stood at 8 percent in April.
   That rate has more than doubled in the past year to the highest
among major industrialized nations. Lawson predicted in March that
the rate would peak at 8 percent, but private economists think it
may go even higher before easing.
   Mrs. Thatcher's fight against inflation has been made more
difficult by the pound's fall, which makes imports more expensive.
The government responded by pushing up key interest rates a full
percentage point to 14 percent last week.
   It was the 10th increase since interest rates reached a decade
low of 7.5 percent about a year ago. The latest hike brought the
rate to its highest level in more four years, and economists say it
could go higher still.
   Meanwhile, the trade deficit has ballooned to $13 billion this
year, from $8.5 billion a year ago.
   The strikes, mostly for higher pay, are expected to subside
after a current round of wage negotiations. But they are causing
fears of a wage-price spiral as workers, whose earnings increased
at an annual rate of 9.5 percent in April, demand even more money
to offset inflation.
   Critics blame the economy's overheating on Lawson's tax cuts and
a loosened monetary policy. But the chancellor says the setback is
temporary. ``Overheating is on the way to subsiding,'' he said last
week. ``It is only a matter of time before inflation is coming
down.''

<HEAD>State, Occidental Reach Agreement On Love Canal Wastes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN F. BONFATTI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Chemical Corp. has for the first
time agreed to take some responsibility for cleaning up chemical
contamination at the old Love Canal industrial dump area, officials
said Thursday.
   Occidental has signed a consent agreement that calls for it to
take over disposal of toxic wastes excavated from two creeks near
the neighborhood in nearby Niagara Falls.
   The agreement could save taxpayers up to $20 million, said state
Environmental Conservation Commissioner Thomas Jorling.
   ``We have succeeded in getting Occidental to accept some
responsibility and take an active role in the remediation of Love
Canal, even though the company continues to fight its liability for
this national disaster,'' Jorling said.
   An Occidental subsidiary, Hooker Chemical Co., used an abandoned
waterway project as a chemical dump in the 1940s. The dump was
covered over in the 1950s and homes were built on the site in the
1960s. In the 1970s, toxic chemicals began seeping into basements
and yards, causing health problems.
   Occidental has taken the position that it was not responsible
for the environmental disaster because it had sold the land and
took no part in housing development at the site.
   Under the agreement, Occidental will take contaminated sediment
dredged from creeks north of the company's former chemical dump and
store it at a newly constructed facility at its Niagara Falls
plant. The sediment is contaminated with chemicals, including the
class of toxic chemicals called dioxins, that seeped out of the
dump or washed in from sewers.
   The waste eventually is to be incinerated, officials said.
   Jorling, who flew to Buffalo to make the announcement, said
Occidental has ``grown to respect the liability aspects of the
law.''
   But he stressed that it was ``a very limited agreement,''
directed to a single remedial action and leaves many issues
unresolved at other Occidental sites.
   Occidental, which abbreviates its name as OxyChem, issued a
statement later.
   ``The decisions and actions discussed here today by the
regulatory agencies mean that we can immediately move forward on a
program that OxyChem strongly believes to be in the best overall
interests of the community and the environment,'' said Thomas L.
Jennings, the company's vice president for corporate environmental
affairs.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly

trend caused by drought-quenching Midwest rains.
   ``I think we probably have factored a lot of rainfall into these
markets,'' said Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``We've had sort of a steady spate of rain now for the past two

   Eddie Mansfield has never traded a futures
contract, yet his is one of the best-known names to traders on the
floor of the Chicago Board of Trade.
   His contributions to the commodities industry may never make it
into the history books, but leaders of the world's oldest and
largest futures exchange say the long-time security guard and
``grand marshal'' of the exchange will never be forgotten.
   Mansfield's 65 years of service were honored with a retirement
party Thursday, attended by hundreds of well-wishers and held near
the entrance to the Board of Trade's grain-trading floor, which in
1985 officially was dubbed the Edward E. Mansfield Trading Room.
   The area is one where Mansfield spent much his career as the
exchange's chief security guard, checking for unfamiliar faces
among those heading for the trading pits.
   Even though the exchange has been stung by recent accusations
about cheating and greed among its traders, Eddie Mansfield says he
wouldn't trade away a minute of his 65 years of Board of Trade
memories.
   ``It's the greatest institution in the world, as far as I am
concerned,'' Mansfield, 81, said Thursday.
   Nowadays, traders enter the trading floor through turnstiles
activated by magnetic cards, just one of the changes Mansfield has
witnessed in his years with the exchange.
   When he was hired at the Board of Trade as a messenger at age
16, with no goals except helping to feed his mother and five
siblings, the exchange was a market where farmers displayed samples
of their grains and prices were relayed by Morse code and displayed
on a large chalkboard.
   These days, nearly all trades are settled by cash rather than
physical delivery, prices are transmitted electronically and
grain-trading volume is dwarfed by activity in financial products
such as U.S. Treasury bond futures.
   Mansfield, who lives comfortably on the 31st floor of a
high-rise overlooking Lake Michigan, can tick off the names of
traders who piled up astounding fortunes in the grain pits. But he
said he never felt compelled to plunge into that risky business.
   ``I might have had a temptation, but I had a responsibility to
my wife and three children, so I didn't trade,'' he said.
   Mansfield had only nice things to say about commodity traders
and the futures industry, which has been beset with federal
investigations of alleged cheating.
   ``It's hard for me to believe it,'' he said. ``With most
members, integrity is the name of the game. They're full of
integrity and they're gentlemen.''
   After stepping down as head of security more than 15 years ago,
the white-haired, wizened Mansfield remained at the Board of Trade
as the exchange's grand marshal, greeting the many dignitaries who
visit the historic marketplace.
   He recalled President Carter as ``the nice, short fella,'' and
remembered President Reagan as the ``fella with a big head of
hair.''
   Mansfield received the Claude D. Pepper Distinguished Service
Award, an honor reserved for people over 55 employed by Chicago
firms, in 1985. He was lauded by the Illinois Legislature in a
resolution adopted on his 80th birthday.
   But perhaps the greatest honor was Thursday's farewell message
from Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann, who said: ``Eddie
couldn't be more of a Board of Trader if he wore a yellow badge
(signifying a full membership in the exchange). We'll be missing
you and we'll always remember you.''

   Stock prices churned ahead today as traders
tried to sort out the Federal Reserve's next move in setting its
credit policy.
   Hopes have been increasing for some time in the financial world
that the Fed might soon begin to ease credit, seeking to cushion a
slowing economy against the risk of recession.
   But some doubts have been voiced lately about the likelihood and
prospective timing of any such action.
   The picture of a dropoff in the pace of business was blurred a
bit Wednesday by reports showing strength in factory orders and the
index of leading economic indicators in April.
   The Fed's strategy may be strongly influenced, analysts said, by
the monthly statistics due out Friday on the employment situation
in May.
   Advance estimates call for the data to show an increase of about
200,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, up from 117,000 in April but
still well below the pace set in the first quarter of the year.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose To New High of $312.68 Billion in Latest Week</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Assets of the nation's 467 money market mutual
funds rose $599.3 million in the latest week to a new all-time high
of $312.68 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday broke the
previous record of $312.08 billion set the previous week, the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. The figure
originally had been reported as a record $312.07 million was was
revised upward.
   The biggest weekly rise in the funds' assets _ $9.64 billion in
the week ended Oct. 21, 1987 _ came during the stock market
collapse as investors sought safe havens for their money.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 231 general purpose funds rose $414.2 million to $101.66
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $167.5 million
to $131.6 billion, and assets of 141 institutional funds rose $17.6
million to $79.43 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 9.11 percent from 9.14 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield slipped to 9.14 percent from 9.15
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
37 days, down from 38 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts remained unchanged as of
Wednesday at 6.62 percent.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.15 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.17
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 9.21
percent the previous week. Yields were 9.28 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 9.33 percent; 9.09 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 9.14
percent; and 9.02 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 9.07 percent.

   The dollar finished mixed against major foreign
currencies Thursday, failing to hold gains made as the West German
central bank decided to leave its key interest rates unchanged.
   Some traders thought the Bundesbank's inaction was good news for
the dollar because it meant investors would not pull money out of
dollars to take advantage of higher West German rates.
   A rally in the dollar began in anticipation of the decision by
the Bundesbank's policy-making council and faded soon after the
actual announcement.
   The dollar finished the day marginally higher against the West
German mark, French franc and Italian lira and slightly slower
against the Japanese yen, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian
dollar.
   Some traders were looking ahead to Friday's announcement by the
Labor Department of employment figures for May, said Regina
Morellino, a trader at Banque Indosuez in New York.
   Many big players preferred to remain on the sidelines while
finance ministers from the major industrialized nations met at the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris,
dealers said.
   A West German rate hike would have followed similar moves by
Japan, Switzerland and Britain. Those moves were largely targeted
at the surging dollar, which had climbed above 2 West German marks
in recent trading sessions.
   In London, the British pound rose against the dollar to $1.5730
from $1.5682 late Wednesday. Later in New York the pound rose to
$1.5776 from $1.5735.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 142.52 yen, down 0.18 yen from
Wednesday. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 142.70 yen.
In New York the dollar fell to 142.41 yen from 142.90 Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.9820 marks, up from 1.9815; 1.7005
Swiss francs, down from 1.7098; 1.2053 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2072; 6.7240 French francs, up from 6.7195; and 1,436 Italian
lire, up from 1,434.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.9835 marks, up from 1.9755; 1.7040
Swiss francs, down from 1.7055; 6.7185 French francs, up from
6.6855; 2.2370 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2460; 1,442.50 lire,
down from 1,443.00; 1.2068 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2061.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $3.71 a troy ounce to close at a bid
$360.97.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $362.50 a troy ounce,
compared with late Wednesday's $363.50. In Zurich, gold fell to a
bid $361.85 compared with $363.43 late Wednesday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $364.10 a troy ounce from $363.30.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $362.05
an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT from $361 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market to a late bid of
$5.22 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $5.20. On New York's
Comex, silver bullion for current delivery rose to $5.198 an ounce
from $5.16.

<HEAD>Feeder Cattle Futures Leap In Reaction To Grain Price Plunge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Feeder cattle futures prices soared Thursday on speculation that
falling grain prices will encourage feedlot operators to buy more
cattle to fatten.
   On other markets, grains and soybeans ended mostly higher,
bucking the recent trade; copper futures prices dropped sharply
while precious metals rose; and energy futures were mixed.
   Feeder cattle settled 1.18 cents to 1.50 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in August at 77.95 cents a pound. Both the
August and September contracts traded up the daily limit.
   In other livestock and meat trading, live cattle were .15 cent
to .78 cent higher with June at 69.05 cents a pound; live hogs were
.10 cent to .45 cent higher with June at 48.32 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .65 cent higher with July at
30.52 cents a pound.
   The rally was rooted in perceptions that the sharp drop in corn
and soybean futures prices over the past three weeks _ a result of
increased Midwest rainfall _ would reduce feedlot operators' feed
costs, leaving them with more money with which to purchase cattle.
   The feeder-cattle market's initial gains of .60 cent to .70 cent
triggered waves of computer fund buying, which pushed the market to
the limit. The bullish fever also spread to the adjacent
live-cattle pit, although lower grain prices are likely to lead to
lower, not higher prices for slaughter-ready animals.
   ``It's hard to stand in the live cattle pit and not be
influenced by what's going on right next to you,'' said Chuck
Levitt, senior livestock market analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in Chicago.
   Most grain and soybean futures prices rose on the Chicago Board
of Trade, bucking the recent trend and suggesting the markets have
absorbed as much rain as is likely to fall in the Midwest for at
least a week.
   ``I think we probably have factored a lot of rainfall into these
markets,'' said Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Recent rains have alleviated fears of a rerun of last year's
drought. Many traders who had sold earlier in the month, hoping
that prices would fall, returned as buyers on Thursday.
   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with July at $3.88{
a bushel; corn was } cent lower to 1} cents higher with July at
$2.60 a bushel; oats were 4} cents to 5 cents higher with July at
$1.71} a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents lower to 8 cents higher with
July at $7.08 a bushel.
   Copper futures prices fell sharply on New York's Commodity
Exchange, reflecting a supply expansion after two years of extreme
tightness.
   Copper consumption is entering a period of seasonal weakness,
further contributing to the markets softening after a runup to a
record high of $1.6475 a pound in December.
   ``This is a market that has kind of gone from miracle to miracle
and has run out of support,'' said Craig Sloane, a metals analyst
in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   Copper settled 2.45 cents to 3.25 cents lower with June at
$1.102 a pound.
   Precious metals recovered slightly from Wednesday's slide on the
Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 80 cents higher across the board with June at
$364.10 a troy ounce; silver was 3.5 cents to 3.8 cents higher with
June at $5.198 a troy ounce.
   Oil futures prices were mixed in quiet trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange ahead of the start Friday of an OPEC strategy
meeting in Vienna, Austria.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents lower to 6
cents higher with July at $19.81 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent
lower to .33 cent higher with July at 48.09 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .47 cent to 1.21 cents lower with July at
63.34 cents a gallon.

   Petroleum futures prices were mixed in quiet
trading Thursday, with many investors moving to the sidelines to
await the outcome of next week's OPEC meeting.
   Pressure has been building within the cartel to raise its
self-imposed quota by more than 1 million barrels a day, a move
that some fear will dampen prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S., fell 9 cents to
close at $19.81 a barrel. Other contract months rose.
   Among refined products, wholesale unleaded gasoline for July
delivery lost 1.21 cents to 63.34 cents a gallon, while contracts
for later delivery also fell.
   Wholesale heating oil for July, meanwhile, rose 0.33 cent to
48.09 a gallon, as other contract months ended mixed.
   Traders said activity on the exchange, which has slowed
considerably in the last two weeks, was grinding to a
near-standstill as the market turned its attention to Vienna, where
the 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are gathering for their semi-annual meeting.
   The meeting, scheduled for Monday, was to be preceded by a
meeting of the cartel's price-monitoring committee on Friday. Eight
ministers form that group.
   Analysts said new speculation that the cartel would raise its
current 18.5 million barrel-per-day production ceiling by between 1
million and 1.5 million barrels set a bearish tone for the market.
   ``Although the reports are not new, they make what we've already
heard more definite,'' said Greg Dreis, energy broker with Merrill
Lynch Energy Futures.
   Crude oil prices have risen more than 30 percent from around $15
last November when OPEC agreed to lower its production to 18.5
million barrels from more than 22 million. The quota was to remain
in effect for the first six months of 1989 to drive prices up to at
least $18 a barrel.

<HEAD>Broadest Measure of Money Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A broad measure of the nation's money supply
rose by $2.2 billion in the week ended May 22, but the broadest
measure fell by $2.6 billion, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,072.3 billion from $3,070.1 billion the previous week.
   The broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted $3,952.1
billion from $3,954.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $772.5 billion from $773.0 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of
3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since
early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Fed said bank borrowings from the Federal Reserve System at
the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $534
million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from $466 million the
previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $289.6 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, unchanged from the two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>KLM Part Of Checchi's Bid For Northwest Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is part of an
investment group led by Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi that
has submitted a friendly bid to buy NWA Inc., the parent of
Northwest Airlines, a KLM spokesman said Thursday.
   KLM spokesman Peter Wellhuener said the Dutch state airliner has
``a commitment to an American investment group headed by Mr. Alfred
Checchi to take an indirect interest'' in the company bidding for
Northwest.
   Wellhuener refused further comment, citing the confidentiality
of the agreement between Checchi and Amsterdam-based KLM.
   NWA stock rose 87{ cents Thursday to close at $108.37{ in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Mike Hamilton, an analyst for Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood Inc., said KLM's participation in the bid doesn't change
the proposal, which NWA Chairman Steven Rothmeier has described as
friendly.
   Laws limiting foreign ownership of U.S. carriers would prevent
KLM from taking a controlling stake in Northwest, said Kurt Rivard,
an analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. of Minneapolis.
   Barbara Beyer, president of Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting
firm in Arlington, Va., said the move may strengthen Checchi's bid
because it would allow KLM and Northwest to strike a working
relationship similar to a marketing agreement between United
Airlines and British Airways.
   ``It would probably make a lot of sense,'' Beyer said. ``I guess
if I have any concerns, it's that I don't have a feel KLM is big
enough to carry something like that off.''
   Other known bidders for NWA include Pan Am Corp., which has
offered about $110 a share, or $3.3 billion, and Marvin Davis, the
billionaire Los Angeles investor. The size of the bids by Davis and
Checchi have not been disclosed. But a Davis spokesman said the oil
mogul's latest offer is a revision ``upward'' from his hostile
tender offer of $2.7 billion, or $90 a share.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the leveraged buyout specialist,
is also rumored as a possible bidder for NWA, but a KKR spokesman
in New York on Thursday declined comment.
   Hamilton said the prevalent belief on Wall Street is that KKR is
a player in the takeover struggle, even if it failed to meet the
bidding deadline of Tuesday set by NWA's board of directors.
   ``One way or another, if KKR wants to be involved, they're going
to be involved,'' Hamilton said.
   Also making a proposal to Northwest Airlines is its
20,000-member machinists' union. Guy Cook, president of the
International Association of Machinists District Lodge 143, has not
revealed details of the union's offer. But in the past he has said
it would seek to team a ``patient investor'' with Northwest's
37,000 employees in buying a large block of NWA stock.
   Northwest said it will not identify its suitors or disclose
proposals. Four of the airline's board members will review the
bids, which are expected to remain open until June 16.
   Checchi, a former Marriott Corp. executive who has associated
with the Bass brothers' investment operations, has two other former
Marriott executives as partners: Walt Disney Co.'s chief financial
officer, Gary Wilson, who is a former NWA board member; and
Washington investment banker Fred Malek. The group also includes
Elders IXL Ltd., a diversified Australian company.

   British Telecom Ltd. said Thursday its earnings
rose 2.3 percent in its fourth fiscal quarter when measured
according to American accounting standards.
   The company said it expected a year of progress in spite of
``the less buoyant outlook for the domestic economy.''
   Quarterly earnings rose to 358 million British pounds, or $605
million at current exchange rates, from 350 million pounds a year
earlier. The fourth quarter of the year-earlier period had two
extra working days.
   Earnings per American depository receipt rose to 59 pence, or
$1, from 58 pence a year earlier. Each ADR represents 10 shares of
British Telecom ordinary stock.
   Revenue rose 7.4 percent to 2.89 billion pounds, or $4.85
billion, in the three-month period ended March 31 from 2.69 billion
pounds a year earlier.
   For the year as a whole, British Telecom said its earnings rose
to 1.52 billion pounds, or $2.57 billion, from 1.39 billion pounds
a year earlier.
   Earnings per ADR rose to 2.52 pounds, or $4.26, from 2.31 pounds.
   Revenue rose to 11.1 billion pounds, or $18.7 billion, from 10.2
billion pounds a year earlier.
   British Telecom reports results differently to American
stockholders and British stockholders to reflect differences in
national accounting standards.

<HEAD>Alar Stand May Have Cost Tree Top Chief His Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dispute over Tree Top Inc.'s stand
against Alar use may have cost company president Dennis Colleran
his job, a source with the apple processor said Thursday.
   The company's refusal to accept Alar-treated apples has angered
some of the growers who own the nation's largest apple juice maker,
said the source, who wished to remain unidentified.
   ``The warehouses are choked with Alar-treated fruit that can't
be marketed fresh,'' the source said.
   Many of those growers had hoped to divert the Alar-treated fruit
to Tree Top for processing into juice, making less money but
avoiding a total loss, the source said.
   But under Colleran that option has been closed.
   Tree Top for the past three years has refused to accept
Alar-treated apples for its own brand of apple juice. In May, the
company also announced that it planned to break contracts with
grower-members who used Alar on any of the coming season's crop,
even if the apples were not sent to Tree Top for processing.
   In addition, Colleran has been calling for an immediate ban on
Alar as a way to restore consumer confidence.
   Alar has been labeled a possible carcinogen by a private
consumer group, but is still legal to use. The federal government
has announced plans to ban Alar.
   An unknown but apparently large number of Alar-treated apples
are still filling Washington warehouses, and fears are growing that
many will have to be dumped, substantially increasing the estimated
$100 million in losses the apple industry has suffered nationally
so far this year.
   Colleran's resignation was announced on Wednesday, but no reason
was given.
   ``It is a private matter between Mr. Colleran and the board of
directors,'' Tree Top spokesman John McAlister said Thursday. ``The
resignation results from differences in management philosophy.''
   McAlister refused to elaborate and also retracted his Wednesday
statement that the resignation was not Alar related. He said he was
not supposed to offer any explanation on the cause of the
resignation.
   Colleran declined to comment Thursday. He said he was
negotiating his severance package with Tree Top's directors.
   Several of the cooperative's board members failed to return
telephone messages.
   Public fears over consumption of Alar apples have devastated
sales of both the fruit and apple juice.
   Sales of Tree Top juice have dropped over 20 percent since the
controversy began in February.
   Alar, the marketing name for daminozide, is sprayed on apple
trees to improve the color and crispness of the fruit and to extend
shelf life. Federal regulators estimate it is used on up to 15
percent of the apple crop.
   Colleran is one of the apple juice industry's leading figures,
serving as president of the Processed Apple Institute and also on
the board of the National Food Processors Association.

   OPEC ministers are getting ready to
negotiate a new oil production strategy, amid price and output
demands aimed at changing the current cartel accord that has seen a
rise in world crude prices.
   Ministers of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries were to gather Friday at their Vienna, Austria
headquarters in advance of their mid-year meeting set to begin
Monday.
   The cartel's eight-member price monitoring panel was to meet
Friday, although ministers from the rest of the nations were
expected to attend.
   OPEC's agreement last November to limit output in order to
support a price of $18 a barrel for its crude was seen as helping
push oil prices higher, but several members have indicated they
want to change either production quotas or the benchmark price.
   ``They will come to an agreement at the end,'' said Pierre
Terzian, editor of the Paris-based oil publication,
Petrostrategies. ``But it will be rather difficult.''
   In advance of the discussions, several ministers have made
proposals for the accord that will determine production and price
levels for the last half of 1989.
   Saudi Arabia's oil chief, Hisham Nazer, has said he would
recommend removing the $18 a barrel benchmark.
   OPEC agreed last November to limit cartel production to 18.5
million barrels a day in order to support the $18 a barrel price,
although some nations widely are seen as cheating on their
individual quotas.
   Prices have climbed since the accord, partly due to other
factors that disrupted some non-OPEC production. Some OPEC nations
have indicated the output ceiling should be raised for the second
half of the year.
   ``The government of Saudi Arabia believes that OPEC should set
for itself a production ceiling and strictly adhere to it,'' Nazer
told the New York Times earlier this week.
   ``This will give members a chance to take advantage of
situations where the price goes above $18 a barrel,'' he said.
   Algeria's Sadek Boussena was quoted in Petrostrategies as
insisting on a target of $18 a barrel for the rest of the year.
   The average price for a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC
has skyrocketed from $12.34 a barrel at the end of November to
$17.67 a barrel last week, although it exceeded the $18 target
earlier this year.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, closed down 9 cents at $19.81 a barrel Thursday on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. The near month West Texas
Intermediate contract had touched lows in the $12.60 a barrel range
as late as last October.
   This year's price surge has been attributed not only to OPEC but
also to accidents in oil-producing areas, such as the oil spill in
Alaska's Prince William Sound, that caused temporary supply
disruptions.
   Nick Antill, an analyst at the brokerage County NatWest in
London, predicted OPEC would lift its production cap by a million
or so barrels, ranging from 19.5 million barrels to 20 million
barrels.
   Some analysts estimate production in April and May was about
20.5 million barrels a day.
   OPEC reported last week that 12 of its members supplied 17.54
million barrels a day into the international market last month,
compared with the supply target of 17.51 million barrels.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, analysts say, will be
pressing for a larger share of the total in a push that could anger
some of the other members.
   Sheikh Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, said
OPEC's key issues are ``increasing the organization's production
ceiling and sharing out the increment among member countries.''
   The International Energy Agency, in its Monthly Oil Market
Report, estimated Kuwait's production in April at 1.4 million
barrels a day, compared with its 1 million barrel daily quota.
   The United Arab Emirates, considered a persistent cheater,
produced about 1.6 million barrels a day, compared with its cap of
988,000 barrels, according to the oil market report.
   The report estimated demand for OPEC would run about 20.4
million barrels a day in the second half of the year.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Defense Mistrial Request in Bilzerian Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys at the securities fraud trial
of Singer Co. Chairman Paul Bilzerian accused the judge of
prejudicing the jury and asked him to declare a mistrial Thursday.
   U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward, who has grown increasingly
irritated with the slow pace of Bilzerian's questioning by defense
lawyer Arthur Mathews, denied the request.
   Although he told lawyers that he had ``bent over backwards'' to
accommodate the defense at times, Ward later told the jury:
``Ladies and gentlemen, I may have appeared to have been impatient
with Mr. Mathews. I would instruct you that this should not be
taken as an indication of any view of mine on the merits of the
case.''
   The trial, the first prosecution of a corporate raider using
information derived from the Ivan F. Boesky insider trading probe,
is winding up its fifth week.
   Bilzerian, 38, of Tampa, Fla., is accused of conspiracy,
violating securities and tax laws and making false statements in
connection with four failed takeover attempts in 1985 and 1986.
   None of the charges involve Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeover
of Singer last year.
   Bilzerian has been on the witness stand since Tuesday, mostly on
direct examination by Matthews. The defense was forced to alter its
strategy after Ward issued an unfavorable ruling that would have
helped the government's cross-examination.
   Since that ruling, Bilzerian's testimony has dealt in minute
detail with the four takeover bids charged in the indictment.
   When Mathews said he wanted to complete his questioning after
the lunch break, the judge told him in a loud voice: ``No, I want
you to finish your examination. I have kept the jury now so that we
could conclude it. You know we have matters to take up between the
direct and cross-examination. You will finish this, please.''
   Later, when Bilzerian's testimony drifted off into a long story
about how he sought an intermediary in one of the takeover
attempts, Ward lifted a book above the bench and dropped it in
apparent exasperation.
   The judge stood up and told Mathews, ``If your client couldn't
know by now that he is not supposed to testify in this way, I will
have to tell him.''
   Ward added: ``I suggest further that you restructure your
questions concerning conversations and that we not get into this
narrative. I don't think it's helpful, under the circumstances.''
   With the jury out of the room, Mathews later asked Ward to
declare a mistrial, saying his actions were prejudicial to the
defense.
   The judge declined and the trial resumed.
   Under cross-examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney David
Brodsky, Bilzerian called a prosecution witness, stock trader
Michael Landy, a liar.
   Landy, a trader at the California brokerage, Jefferies &amp; Co.,
testified that Bilzerian promised to reverse a 1985 stock sale in
order to create illegal tax losses.
   ``I watched Michael Landy on the stand a few weeks ago and I
have no problem calling him a liar,'' said Bilzerian.
   His cross-examination was to continue Friday.

<HEAD>Investment Group Discloses Stake in America West</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An investment group that includes Martin T.
Sossnoff and Nelson Peltz disclosed Thursday it holds an 8.46
percent interest in America West Airlines.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
group said Atalanta-Sossnoff Capital Corp. holds 16,400 common
shares plus $16.6 million in 11{ percent convertible debentures,
nearly the equivalent of 1.5 million common shares. The investment
group said it paid $17.75 million for its holdings in America West,
an aggressive regional carrier.
   The group also told the SEC the interest was acquired solely for
investment.
   America West recently made a $415 million offer for strikebound
Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle, challenging Eastern's earlier
agreement to sell the lucrative service to developer Donald Trump
for $365 million. Last Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland approved the sale to Trump, after America West failed to
secure financing for its offer by a Wednesday deadline set by
Eastern.
   The principal owner of Atalanta-Sosnoff Capital, an investment
management and brokerage business, is Sossnoff, who also is
chairman. Peltz, another major investor, is on the group's board of
directors.
   The America West debenture offering became available Jan. 1 in
exchange for earlier 7{ percent and 7\ percent issues and allowed
the airline to retire some long-term debt.

   Stock prices gained ground Thursday in a session
dominated by a record-sized transaction in Texaco shares just as
the market closed.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.48 points to
2,490.63.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
879 up, 574 down and 527 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 223.16 million
shares, against 162.53 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 262.03 million shares.
   As the New York market was about to close, three big Wall Street
firms handled a 42.32 million-share block trade of Texaco at 49,
down 2[ from Wednesday's last price.
   Financier Carl Icahn said later that he had unloaded his
position in the company to pursue other objectives. Wall Street
traders speculated that Icahn possibly was interested in expanding
his holdings in USX Corp., in which he has long held a large stake.
USX shares jumped 2} to 37\.
   The $2 billion-plus Texaco trade was the largest single block,
as measured by dollar value, ever at the Big Board.
   Texaco spokeswoman Anita Larsen said the shares were bought by
the investment firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Salomon Brothers
Inc. and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., which intended to sell them worldwide.
   For most of the day, traders' attention focused on the likely
future course of the Federal Reserve's credit policy.
   Hopes have been increasing for some time in the financial world
that the Fed might soon begin to ease credit, seeking to cushion a
slowing economy against the risk of recession.
   But some doubts have been voiced lately about the likelihood and
prospective timing of any such action.
   The picture of a dropoff in the pace of business was blurred a
bit Wednesday by reports showing strength in factory orders and the
index of leading economic indicators in April.
   The Fed's near-term strategy may be strongly influenced,
analysts said, by the monthly statistics due out Friday on the
employment situation in May.
   Advance estimates call for the data to show an increase of about
200,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, up from 117,000 in April but
still well below the pace set in the first quarter of the year.
   Aside from USX, gainers among the blue chips included Eastman
Kodak, up 2 at 46}; International Business Machines, up ] at 110,
and General Motors, up ~ at 41\.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association preferred stock climbed
2{ to 77] in active trading. Freddie Mac, as it is known, declared
a 40-cents-a-share quarterly dividend on the preferred shares, and
a sharply increased payout on its common stock, which is owned by
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $13.90 billion, or
0.44 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .78 to 179.63.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.62 to 369.46, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.45 at 321.97.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
climbed 2.15 to 448.32. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 358.09, up 1.43.

   Police arrested three top leaders
of the small leftist Workers Party on Thursday on orders from a
judge who accused the party of spurring food riots that killed at
least 14 people this week.
   Looters, many of them women and children, have been sacking
stores and eating food on the spot in the nationwide unrest despite
a state of siege the government declared on Monday.
   The riots subsided Thursday, but the economic crisis that
sparked them worsened. Officials tried to head off further looting
by handing out free food to the needy.
   Police arrested Jorge Altamira, Workers Party president and
presidential candidate in the May 14 election; Juan C. Capurro,
legal representative; and Octavio Camera at Government House in
downtown Buenos Aires.
   The three had gone to the seat of government to meet with
Interior Ministry officials to seek the release of party members
arrested during the rioting.
   Altamira spoke with reporters before being taken to jail. He
denied any connection between the party and the disturbances and
said any government claims of a link amounted to ``ideological
persecution.''
   Fourteen people died during the riots, according to the first
official count, issued by the Interior Ministry Thursday night.
Earlier counts made on the basis of police and hospital reports
indicated 16 people were killed.
   Federal Judge Gerardo Larrambebere of suburban Moron on Thursday
ordered the arrests as well as the search and closing of all
Workers Party offices in the metropolitan area.
   The judge said his order was based on ``prima facie evidence
showing that party activists encouraged in large measure'' the
rioting.
   The court's jurisdiction includes San Miguel and Moreno, scenes
of widespread looting and destruction Monday and Tuesday, along
with major interior cities and other suburbs.
   Six people died in San Miguel and three in Moreno after hundreds
of people, many from nearby shantytowns, sacked supermarkets,
neighborhood grocery stores, butcher shops and bakeries.
   Several government officials, including Interior Minister Juan
Carlos Pugliese, earlier accused the Workers Party of being among
several leftist groups whose members had ``agitated'' and
``organized'' looters.
   The small party, which follows the Marxist teachings of Russian
revolutionary Leon Trotsky, ran a partial slate of candidates in
national elections but won only 0.3 percent of the nearly 20
million votes cast.
   Provincial officials across Argentina set up soup kitchens,
froze supermarket prices for basic foods and medicine, and
coordinated charity collections of food and clothing Thursday.
   The austral continued its devaluation against the dollar,
sliding in black market trading to 230-1, or 24 percent less than
the rate of 175-1 set two days ago by the Central Bank. Foreign
exchange houses refused to sell dollars at the official price.
   Government employees in several provinces threatened to strike
for higher pay, bakers in Buenos Aires refused to sell bread at the
official price, and stores continued to mark up products in the
face of inflation running at about 70 percent a month.
   Former President Arturo Frondizi publicly urged the incumbent,
Raul Alfonsin, to resign immediately and hand power over to
President-elect Carlos Menem, who is to take office Dec. 10.
   Menem won national elections May 14, and his Peronist Party won
virtual control of both houses of Congress.
   An obstacle cited by his aides is that Menem wants his allies in
Congress to take office early if he does.
   Prominent business, labor and political leaders suggested
earlier that Alfonsin step down early.
   Since February, the austral has been devalued by 92 percent, and
soaring inflation has led to layoffs, shortages of goods and a
sharp decline in buying power for the nation's population of 31
million.
   The unrest began last week in Mendoza and Cordoba. On Thursday,
a police officer was seriously injured when shot in the face during
a shootout with people trying to loot a butcher's shop in the
Buenos Aires suburb of Caseros.
   In Tucuman, 820 miles north of the capital, a woman was crushed
to death under sugar bags that fell while she and about 50 other
people were looting a warehouse.
   More than 2,000 people have been arrested over the past nine
days, at least 100 have been shot and wounded, some by rubber
bullets, and dozens more have been injured by tear gas, sticks,
flying glass and rocks during the riots.
   In the country's third largest city, Rosario, hard hit by
looting, people in some poor neighborhoods were selling some of
what they stole.
   Bottles of champagne and whiskey were going for 20 australs
apiece, or less than 10 cents, the government news agency Telam
reported.
   About 3,000 paramilitary police and members of the National
Guard and Coast Guard patrolled the streets of Rosario, 190 miles
north of Buenos Aires.

<TEXT>
   Carl Icahn ended a long and contentious
association with Texaco Inc. on Thursday, selling a Wall
Street-record 42.32 million share block of the oil company's stock.
   ``We think the company has improved a great deal in a year and a
half and we like to think we played a small part in helping them to
do that, but we felt it was time to move on and we wish the company
and management well,'' Icahn said in a telephone interview.
   The shares in the block sold for $49 each, making the entire
block worth more than $2.07 billion. New York Stock Exchange
spokeswoman Catherine Maroney said the block was the most expensive
ever sold on the exchange.
   Texaco spokeswoman Anita Larsen said the shares were bought by
the investment firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Salomon Brothers
Inc. and Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
   The three companies intend to offer the shares worldwide, Ms.
Larsen said, noting that the shares remained under restrictions set
under an agreement between Icahn and Texaco in January. Those
restrictions were intended to ensure that the stock would not end
up in the hands of a potentially hostile suitor.
   Ms. Larsen said Texaco had no further comment on the sale.
Texaco stock closed down $2.12{ at $49 a share.
   Icahn earlier this year was known to hold 16.6 percent of
Texaco's 244.3 million outstanding common shares _ roughly 40.5
million shares _ making him the company's largest stockholder.
   Icahn's profit on the stock deal is estimated at almost $700
million, including dividends, The New York Times reported in Friday
editions.
   Icahn became Texaco's biggest shareholder when Trans World
Airlines, of which he is chairman, bought a 12 million-share block
from Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court in November 1987.
TWA already had owned 5.9 million Texaco shares.
   Icahn complained that Texaco management was not doing enough to
raise the company's stock price and indicated he was willing to
mount a takeover of the company which. If successful, he indicated,
a takeover would lead to the piecemeal sale of its assets with
proceeds going to Texaco shareholders.
   His threats complicated the oil company's attempt to extricate
itself from bankruptcy proceedings and a $10.35 billion judgment
won against the Texaco by Pennzoil Co.
   Icahn proposed a takeover of Texaco valued at $14.5 billion that
the company's board rejected. He then tried and failed to unseat
the board in a proxy fight at Texaco's annual meeting a year ago.
   He also fought with Texaco over the terms of its subsequent
bankruptcy reorganization plan. The company sought protection from
creditors to avoid posting a multibillion-dollar bond while it
appealed the 1985 Pennzoil verdict, which resulted from Texaco's
acquisition of Getty Oil Co.
   After Texaco emerged from bankruptcy protection, Icahn again
bickered with management over its plan to sell billions of dollars
of assets and pay stockholders a special dividend totaling about
$1.69 billion.
   These issues were resolved in the January agreement, which
limited how the takeover strategist could sell his stock and barred
him from making a takeover attempt against Texaco for seven years.
He had been expected to sell his stake since the agreement was
signed.
   Icahn declined to comment further, so it was not immediately
known how he planned to use the proceeds of the stock sale and
special dividend. There has been widespread speculation that Icahn,
who also controls a major stake in USX Corp., would make a play for
that oil and steel giant.
   Thursday's Texaco block trade was the second-largest in terms of
shares, after the 1986 sale of 48.79 million-share block of
Navistar International Corp. That block sold for $10 a share, or
$487.9 million.
