   The leader of this week's
guerrilla assault on an army base is a leftist extremist linked to
the assassination of deposed Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza,
sources said Thursday.
   Government and security sources said on condition of anonymity
that Enrique Gorriaran Merlo directed the attack and seizure Monday
of the 3rd Infantry Regiment's base in the northwestern Buenos Aires
suburn of La Tablada.
   Gorriaran, a leader of the now-defunct People's Revolutionary
Army, is believed to have escaped during a spectacular 27-hour seige
in which army and police forces retook the base, they said.
   Police and court investigators probed links between the attackers
and left-wing organizations. The death toll from the assault rose
Thursday to 38 with the death of a wounded police officer.
   In all, the dead included eight army soldiers, two policemen, and
28 guerrillas. Nineteen guerrillas were captured.
   Also Thursday, police acting on a court order raided several
houses in the oceanfront city of Mar del Plata, 250 miles south of
Buenos Aires. Authorities said three people were arrested, but gave
no other details.
   In the Buenos Aires area on Wednesday, police raided about 25
houses in what the sources said was an unsuccessful bid to nab
Gorriaran, one of Latin America's most notorious leftist extremists.
   The People's Revolutionary Army was a Marxist guerrilla
organization active in the early and mid-1970s. It was decimated in
a harsh anti-subversion campaign waged by armed forces leaders who
seized power in a 1976 coup.
   Gorriaran, however, escaped arrest during the campaign and fled
abroad. In 1980 he led a team of Argentine and Nicaraguan guerrillas
who assassinated Somoza, in the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion,
Gorriaran himself said in published interviews. Somoza, Nicaragua's
ousted right-wing strongman, had been ousted by the leftist
Sandinistas in 1979.
   When the elected government of President Raul Alfonsin assumed
power in Argentina in 1983, he issued a decree ordering the
prosecution of five notorious leftist guerrillas, including
Gorriaran. In the same decree he ordered the trial of nine former
leaders of the rightist armed forces for human rights abuses.
   Gorriaran remained a fugitive for years and was believed to be
living abroad. Late last year a leftist human rights lawyer, Jorge
Banos, asked the courts to allow Gorriaran to return and face trial
without being imprisoned.
   Police said one of the guerrillas killed in this week's assault
was identified as Banos. He and at least two other of the attackers
whose names have been released by police were active in a leftist
political group, the Movement Everyone for the Country.
   The little-known movement, formed about three years ago,
denounced in early January what it said were plans for a coup by
right-wing extremists in the armed forces. Those elements have led
three short-lived but dramatic uprisings against Alfonsin in 21
months.
   The army base's attackers carried a written proclamation that
said their action was designed to pre-empt a coup and foment
civilian resistance to the military.
   In response to the attack, Alfonsin late Wednesday gave the
military a policy voice in internal security. He decreed creation of
a National Security Council whose members include the chiefs of
staff of the army, navy and air force, along with several civilian
officials.
   Until the council was created, Alfonsin's center-left government
had barred the military from any role in internal security,
maintaining that it was strictly a police matter.
   Human rights groups have said they fear military participation
would mean a return to the harsh anti-leftist repression of the late
1970s, when at least 8,900 people were illegally arrested and then
disappeared. They are presumed dead.
   Also Thursday, the Justice Ministry said it will investigate
allegations by Carlos Menem, presidential candidate of the
opposition Peronist Party, that the assault on the base was designed
to embarrass his party.
   According to Menem, the motive was to ``enter (the base), do some
damage and leave behind propaganda connecting the Peronist Party
with the sectors of the army that mutinied a few days ago.''
   The point, would be ``to destroy definitively, to bury the image
of the Peronist Party and its candidate.'' Menem offered no evidence
to support his reasoning, and no evidence has been disclosed to link
the assault to the party.

<HEAD>Burt Surrenders Medical License</HEAD>

   A gynecologist accused of performing
genital-altering surgery on women can no longer practice medicine in
the United States, the Ohio Medical Board said Wednesday.
   James C. Burt, 67, who had come under fire for his self-described
``love surgery'' which he claimed enhanced sexual responsiveness,
offered to surrender his state medical license last week.
   The ``surrender-revocation'' approved by the board includes a
requirement that the Dayton gynecologist not practice medicine
anywhere in the United States.
   In December, the board charged Burt with ``gross immorality'' for
41 alleged violations ranging from overprescribing drugs to
performing unnecessary surgeries. The board charged that the surgery
caused sexual dysfunction, emotional distress, infection, chronic
pain, incontinence and the need for corrective surgery in many
patients.
   At least three malpractice lawsuits are pending against Burt,
each asking $3 million in damages. The women say Burt performed the
surgery without their consent, but Burt has denied performing the
operations without his patients' permission.
   In a statement accompanying the surrender of his license, Burt
said his practice had always been in accordance with state laws and
the ethics of the American Medical Association.
   ``I have always striven to practice in an above-average manner
and to advance the standards of practice in my specialty,'' the
statement said.
   Burt's attorney, Earl Moore, said Burt had been considering
retirement for some time and did not believe the board would treat
him fairly because its members had been pressured by Gov. Richard
Celeste.
   Moore said Burt was out of Dayton on Wednesday and would not
return until next week. ``He will write and lecture and give
seminars,'' Moore said.
   ``The saga of Dr. Burt is far from over. He's more concerned now
about helping his patients and friends and other doctors,'' and may
continue to promote his surgical technique, Moore said.
   Burt's surgical practices came to public attention when the
CBS-TV news show ``West 57th Street'' aired a report on Burt's
``female circumcision'' technique, which involves the reconstruction
and relocation of the vagina and the removal of flesh covering the
clitoris, an external tissue that responds to sexual stimulation.
Burt described the technique in his 1975 book, ``Surgery of Love.''
   Burt had faced a Jan. 30 hearing before the medical board, but
the panel said its acceptance of the ``surrender-revocation''
eliminates the necessity for formal disciplinary hearings since
license revocation is the maximum penalty the board can impose on a
licensee.
   In signing the surrender-revocation, Burt made no admissions with
respect to his civil liability in the medical malpactice actions
still pending.
   Burt said he closed his practice Jan. 12.
   The doctor performed 170 vaginal reconstruction operations at St.
Elizabeth Medical Center in Dayton, the last in February 1987.
   The hospital said Tuesday an internal investigation concluded
that all of the 170 operations were done with patient consent and
that the hospital planned no further action against Burt.

<TEXT>
   Some people dine by candlelight or enjoy
walking in the moonlight, but Barbara and Tibor Bathony never
expected to drive by flashlight.
   When the headlights on their truck failed in ice fog at nearly 60
degrees below zero eight miles from the tiny town of Tok, the couple
drove the rest of the way with the guiding light of a household
flashlight shining through the windshield.
   ``It was like a whiteout and you try to wave the fog away,'' Mrs.
Bathony said. ``We were trying to see a little better and we turned
the high beam on and all the lights went bad.''
   Mrs. Bathony moved to Juneau in September and was in Fairbanks
last weekend to get the last of her household belongings. She and
her husband left Fairbanks on Sunday in their truck, towing a rented
flatbed and carrying three dogs for the 600-mile trip to Juneau.
   It was minus 53 degrees when they left Fairbanks, minus 57 when
they stopped in the town of North Pole and by the time they reached
Tok about 175 miles southeast, ``none of the thermometers could be
read any more,'' she said.
   There was little traffic, which made it easier to drive by
flashlight when the truck's headlight fuse blew, she said.
   ``Nobody was as dumb as we were to leave at that temperature.''

<HEAD>Brazilian Town Panics After Lightning Sets Off Alarm at Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A thunderstorm set off an alarm
near Brazil's only nuclear power plant, causing thousands of people
to flee a nearby town in panic, civil defense officials said.
   A hilltop siren went off Monday night in the town of Frade, 115
miles southwest of Rio and four miles from the plant.
   Civil Defense Coordinator Elio Serafim said the siren sounded for
about 40 minutes during a thunderstorm and caused ``total
pandemonium'' in the town of 5,000 people.
   ``People thought it was a real emergency and ran to the gas
station, which is the agreed-on meeting point in the evacuation
plan. But when help didn't come, they panicked and tried to escape
any way they could,'' Serafim said by telephone from Angra dos Reis,
a seaside resort city near Frade.
   ``There were 3,000 or 4,000 people running through the streets,
trying to break into cars and trucks to escape. It was complete
chaos,'' Serafim said. The nuclear power plant, meanwhile, had been
shut down for maintenance, he said.
   Civil defense officials tried to call Frade but the town's only
telephone wasn't working and a fuse had burned out in the community
radio post, said Serafim.
   ``We got there about an hour later and were almost lynched.
People were shouting and trying to overturn our car. They were
really upset _ and with good reason,'' he said.

   A federal judge Wednesday stayed the
scheduled execution of death row inmate Arthur James Julius, saying
the courts need more time to address last-minute claims raised by
his attorneys.
   Assistant Attorney General Ed Carnes said the ruling by U.S.
District Judge Truman Hobbs meant Julius' execution, set for Friday,
would be delayed at least a month, possibly much longer.
   Hobbs' decision came after Gov. Guy Hunt refused to grant
clemency for Julius, whose mother and other relatives met with Hunt
earlier in the day.
   Julius was scheduled to be electrocuted at 12:01 a.m. Friday for
the 1978 murder of his cousin, Susie Bell Sanders.
   Ms. Sanders was strangled and sexually assaulted at her
Montgomery home while Julius was free on an eight-hour pass from a
prison work-release center. At the time of the killing, he was
serving a life sentence for a 1972 slaying.
   At issue before Hobbs were defense attorneys' claims that
prosecutors failed to turn over all the materials they had
concerning the 1978 slaying.
   A Montgomery County judge had refused Monday to halt Julius'
execution, and both the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and the
Alabama Supreme Court issued similar rulings Tuesday.
   Alabama's last execution was Aug. 28, 1987, when Wayne Eugene
Ritter was electrocuted for his non-triggerman role in the slaying
of a Mobile pawn shop owner.

   Though mainstream radio has so far chosen to
resist the songs of They Might Be Giants, the biting lyrics and
unique music of guitarist John Flansburgh and accordion player John
Linnell have helped the two-man band build a substantial following.
   ``Our songs are question marks,'' Linnell said. ``We leave a lot
more stuff hanging out than other bands.''
   The music is simple, catchy and deceptively cheerful. ``Shoehorn
With Teeth'' could almost be mistaken for a toothpaste commercial if
it weren't for the lyrics: ``He wants a shoehorn, the one with
teeth. People should get beat up for stating their beliefs.''
   And ``Kiss Me, Son of God'' would fit right into a glee club
recital if someone could find a way around these words: ``Now I
laugh and make a fortune off the same ones that I tortured and the
world screams, `Kiss me, son of God.'''
   ``I think what's weird about our songs is that they work much
more on a synmbolic level than on a literal level,'' Flansburgh
said. ``I'm not trying to make it more poetic than it really is.
We're not too concerned about being really explicit. I think it's
better for a person listening.''
   Linnell and Flansburgh grew up in the suburbs of Boston and
became friends in high school.
   ``We hung out with a clique of people who were like-minded,''
Linnell said. ``We were on the staff of the school newspapaer. The
high school had a newspaper office so we could hang out in the
office and we didn't have to hang out in the hallway.''
   Linnell was the first to show interest in music, playing in high
school bands, but Flansburgh would eventually catch the bug.
   ``I did sort of tape stuff at my own home and started getting
into the punk rock thing,'' Flansburgh said.``Then a friend of mine
gave me a guitar and said, `Play this and you'll never be the
same.'''
   A friend was also the source of Linnell's accordion.
   ``I'd been a keyboard player in other bands, but someone gave me
this accordion and John and I started messing around with that,''
Linnell said. ``I immediately took to it. I think it has the biggest
effect on us on stage. We both have instruments where we can stand
up and move around.''
   After graduating from high school, they went their separate ways,
but reunited in 1981 when both moved to New York and ended up in the
same apartment building. Before long, they were working on songs and
did some home recordings.
   But the two Johns, as they're sometimes called, decided to start
performing and the response was encouraging enough for them to seek
a recording contract.
   ``We were considerably farther off stream when we first
started,'' Linnell said. ``We had done a lot of tapes that weren't
strictly music. Typical sort of high school experimentation. It's
kind of still with us in a way.''
   They still didn't know what to call the group. After trying out
different names, the two Johns were saved by yet another friend.
   ``He was a ventriloquist,'' Flansburgh recalled. ``He had a list
of names for his own performance and one of them was `They Might Be
Giants.' We just decided to rip his name off.''
   Their self-titled debut album came out at the end of 1986 to
nearly unanimous critical acclaim and respectable sales of 100,000
copies.
   ``It was incredibly informal,'' Linnell said. ``All we were doing
was taking tapes we had made and remixing them.''
   Both the first album and ``Lincoln,'' their latest LP, were
released by Bar-None Records, an independent label based in Hoboken,
N.J. ``Lincoln,'' consists of 18 short songs whose titles include
``Purple Toupee'' and ``Snowball in Hell.''
   ``I don't think we're particulary good at writing 10-minute, free
improvisational songs,'' Flansburgh said. ``What we do is really a
normal art form. It's two minutes long and it's got to be catchy
somehow. Once you're secure writing in that medium it seems sort of
unlimited.''
   Even if They Might Be Giants has failed to rule the air waves,
the two Johns are certainly kings of the telephone lines.
   When Flansburgh and Linnell were living together in Brooklyn,
Flansburgh came up with the idea of ``Dial-a-Song.'' By phoning
1-718-387-6962, one can reach an answering machine that plays the
latest They Might Be Giants song. There is no additional cost for
the caller, nor does the duo collect a profit.
   It was a way for people to get our songs without having to leave
their house,'' said Flansburgh, who estimates that Dial-a-Song
receives 100 calls a day.
   ``We didn't want people to go into this incredibly crowded room
with all the smoke. I never went to nightclubs because we're not the
most nightlife-oriented people. We could just relate to people who
worked during the day.''

   When the farm crisis of the '80s swept
mid-America, it took a heavy toll on Iowa: folks lost their land,
Main Streets collapsed and young people deserted their hometowns.
Today, however, despite 1988's withering drought, Iowa's fortunes
are reversing. The final story in a four-part series, ``The Changing
Heartland,'' looks at the upturn in Iowa's economy.

   When Dennis Keitel returned from a
life abroad two years ago, he yearned to settle on the soil he once
called home. He was ready for Iowa, but Iowa wasn't ready for him.
   Jobs were scarce. So was optimism. People were moving out,
merchants were following. But over time, misery has given way to
mending.
   Iowa, a state that once typified the decline and despair of rural
America, is on the rebound. Consider Keitel, an Iowa native who
returned to a state thousands fled, found work where two years ago
there was none, and is praising a land that not long ago was pitied.
   ``I think this place is a gold mine,'' says Keitel, a 36-year-old
engineer who grew up on an eastern Iowa farm.
   ``The Iowa economy is coming on strong,'' boasts Gov. Terry
Branstad. ``We know we still have a long way to go, but we've come a
long ways.''
   Unemployment is down, revenues are up and there's a sense the
worst is over. Some claim a bust-to-boom assessment is too rosy and
premature, but the declining dollar, export opportunities, price
supports and a diversifying economy have contributed to a
turnaround. Consider:
   _ The value of Iowa farmland rose 20.4 percent in 1988, prompting
the Des Moines Register headline ``Iowa Dirt Turns to Gold Again.''
The increase, reported in an Iowa State University study, was the
largest since the mid-1970s. From 1981 to 1986, land values had
plummeted 63 percent.
   _ Iowa's labor force reached an all-time high in October: 1.5
million people working or seeking jobs. Unemployment was 3.5
percent, the lowest since November 1979. In some areas, jobs
outnumber residents. Mount Pleasant has about 5,000 people of
working age but almost 12,000 jobs.
   Iowa soon plans to set up a nationwide toll-free number to lure
back ex-Iowans who left in search of work.
   _ Iowa is expected to have a $180 million budget surplus in the
1989 and 1990 fiscal years, a panel of financial experts said in
December, although some of that will likely be eaten up with federal
mandates.
   _ One in five Iowa farmers has substantial money troubles, down
from one in three in 1984-85, said Neil Harl, an Iowa State
economics professor.
   _ Deere &amp; Co., the state's largest private employer with 14,800
workers, posted record fourth-quarter and year-end earnings.
   _ After six years in which Iowa lost almost 100,000 people, the
Census Bureau reported last month state population increased by
11,000 from 1987 to 1988.
   Despite such numbers, some say last summer's drought will have a
lingering impact. They also worry the state's upturn is bypassing
rural areas where schools have closed, young people have departed
and Main Street merchants have closed up shop.
   ``We haven't turned the corner yet by any means,'' said Dave
Ostendorf of Prairiefire, a rural advocacy group. ``Many of the
rural counties still have poverty rates exceeding 20 percent.''
   Branstad says, though, that no state enjoys ``uniform prosperity.
What we want to do is help those areas that aren't doing as well to
help themselves.''
   The state uses lottery proceeds, for instance, for economic
development, some of the money going for loans, aid to local
communities or research projects.
   Already, the upswing and growth in the meat packing and farm
equipment industries have helped hard-hit blue-collar areas. In
Waterloo, unemployment fell from 8.8 percent last January to 4.3
percent in November.
   ``People feel we've bottomed out,'' said Jim Lawrence, president
of the Waterloo Chamber of Commerce.
   Deere, which has a giant local operation, has recalled workers; a
leather processing plant recently opened, and a new IBP Inc. hog
slaughtering plant is being built, Lawrence said.
   In Mason City, about 1,500 new jobs, many of them service sector
and health-related, will be created in 1989 alone, compared with
about 2,000 in the last five years combined, said Tom Jolas, an
economic development consultant to the city.
   Iowa's recovery is due, in part, to a declining dollar that makes
grain and other products more competitive on the world market, said
state economist Harvey Siegelman.
   ``There will be Winnebagos going to Europe, beef to Japan and
Deere tractors all over the world,'' he said.
   Just as critical is Iowa's effort to reduce its reliance on
agriculture.
   ``The key to success is diversification,'' Branstad said. ``Some
of it actually is building off the agricultural economy that already
exists and finding new uses for products.''
   Branstad said Iowa has also targeted several industries for
development: telecommunications, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and
insurance. Des Moines already is an insurance capital.
   Mount Pleasant, 28 miles from the Mississippi River, learned to
diversify decades ago. It's paid off. The town's business roster
includes such corporate names as Motorola, Cargill and Goodyear. A
Wal-Mart distribution center opened in 1985.
   Mount Pleasant is also home to a large fireplace maker, a bulk
mail distributor that claims more outgoing postage volume than Las
Vegas, and a school bus manufacturer.
   ``We set an example of how we can control our own future,'' said
Glenda Griffin, the local chamber's vice president. ``We appreciate
the help of the state and federal government, but we will not sit
back and depend on them.''
   Mount Pleasant never hit the depths some Iowa communities sank to
in the mid-1980s, though the county unemployment rate was 8.1
percent in 1982-83. In November, it was 2.5 percent.
   In the last six months, two motels, four stores and a truck stop
have opened. Officials say property values rose from $45 million to
$130 million in the last decade; retail sales jumped 18.7 percent
from March 1986 to March 1988.
   Mount Pleasant has also held onto its young people, offering jobs
involving computers and lasers.
   ``There isn't a small town in the state of Iowa that has any more
sophisticated industry than we have,'' said Mayor Tom Vilsack.
   Keitel returned from Saudia Arabia in 1986, ending up as an
engineer in Connecticut when he couldn't find work in Iowa. Last
fall he found a job in Mount Pleasant.
   ``Iowa still has a lot to offer, even with all of its problems,''
he said. ``We haven't lost our sense of values. The quality of life
still means more than the almighty dollar.''
   Vilsack has another explanation:
   ``We can't do a lot about what's plaguing the small-town farmer.
We've given families the opportunity to be in control of their own
lives. Iowa's got to take its destiny in its own hands.''

   A bereaved family held a funeral
service and cremated a body they thought was their father _ then
learned he was still alive, a newspaper reported today.
   ``We do not know who we cremated,'' Subramaniam Nadarajah was
quoted as saying in the New Straits Times daily.
   Nadarajah and his two sisters went to a hospital mortuary at
Sungei Petani and identified a body there as that of their missing
father, Nadarajah, the newspaper reported.
   On Tuesday, 200 people attended his funeral, followed by the
cremation.
   A few hours later a friend of Subramaniam's said he spotted the
father at a Hindu temple. The family rushed to the temple and found
their father, praying.
   The newspaper said the father was missing for seven weeks and
apparently had been admitted to a mental hospital, then released.
   Police said they should be able to identify the dead man.

   Carnegie Hall reopened in late 1986 with a
musical question: Had an extensive interior renovation harmed the
hall's magic sound?
   No way, said Larry Goldman, Carnegie's vice president. Hadn't
management been so meticulous as to remove padding from the new
seats after tests showed they absorbed more sound than the old ones?
   Goldman said he ``never worried about the acoustics.'' He should
have.
   Two years later, many critics and audience members have decided
that Carnegie's old sound has gone the way of its old seats.
   In a tacit admission that something was lost, sound-absorbent
panels have been placed at the rear of the stage, but so far the
results are inconclusive; the hall may have only begun a long search
for its lost sonic glory.
   Carnegies problems raise anew the question of whether acoustics
is science, art or magic _ or luck.
   ``To a certain extent you're shooting craps,'' admits Cyril
Harris, an acoustician for almost 40 years. ``There isn't a
scientific standard for good sound. Different people have different
ideas, depending on what they're used to.''
   Sometimes, local tastes enter into the equation. Earlier in this
century, for example, Bostonians were accustomed to Symphony Hall's
longer reverberation time, Philadelphians to the shorter one in the
smaller Academy of Music.
   Orchestras and conductors, who didn't travel much, were shaped by
their halls. Philadelphia audiences loved the sound of the
Philadelphia Orchestra's strings. When the Boston Symphony Orchestra
visited town, the strings sounded muddy; the Bostonians didn't keep
their bows on the strings as long.
   Musicians, critics and acousticians trade terms such as
``brilliant'' and ``dry'' like connoisseurs at a wine tasting.
Sometimes they even mean the same thing. But there is broad
agreement on what constitutes good sound, and a solid understanding
of the physical laws of acoustics.
   When you sit in a concert hall you hear two kinds of sound:
direct, which comes straight from the stage, and reflected, which
bounces _ off the wall, the ceiling, the shoulder of the person in
the next seat _ before hitting your ear.
   The first reflected sound should hit the ear 20 to 60
milliseconds after leaving the stage, and it should reverberate for
just under two seconds _ the approximate time in such great halls as
Amsterdam's Concertgebouw, Boston's Symphony Hall and Vienna's
Grosser Musikvereinsaal.
   Most of the world's great music halls date from the late 19th
century, and share a rectangular layout; irregular, highly
ornamented interior surfaces that scatter sound; heavy plaster and
wood, which reflect sound well; and fewer than 2,800 seats.
   The concert hall evolved slowly from traditional performance
spaces such as churches and salons, and successful early designers
relied less on inspiration or theory than euphonious precedents.
This preserved some happy accidents, such as the sound diffusion
affected by elaborate wall decoration.
   But pity the 19th century designer who sought to understand what
he was doing. Listen to the great Charles Garnier, architect of the
Paris Opera House:
   ``I gave myself great pains to understand this great science, but
after 15 years of labor found myself hardly in advance of where I
stood the first day. I studied, tested, questioned everything, and I
made finally this discovery: A house to have good acoustics must be
either long or broad, high or low, of wood or stone, round or
square....''
   In fact, the Paris Opera looks better than it sounds; its dome
distributes sound unevenly.
   Garnier's befuddlement might have seemed quaint to the elegantly
dressed patrons who filed in on opening night at Lincoln Center's
Philharmonic Hall in 1962. Millions of dollars and years of
research, they were assured, had created a sonic masterpiece. But by
intermission people were complaining. ``You'd see the basses
playing, but you couldn't hear them,'' recalls Cyril Harris.
   The consultants had designed acoustic ``clouds,'' or ceiling
panels, to reflect sound, but Harris believes low-frequency sound
waves bent around them instead. As a result, some bass sounds were
lost in the rafters. Matters likely were not helped by
Philharmonic's sleek, spare interior and bottle shape.
   Harris was last in a parade of consultants who over the next 16
years tried to improve the hall's acoustics. Finally, it was closed
for six months while the interior was rebuilt at a cost of one-third
the construction price.
   Most say acoustics in the hall _ rechristened Avery Fisher Hall _
are much improved. But it continues to share the ``cold'' sound of
many modernist concert halls built after World War II.
   Money is part of the problem. Halls without government subsidies
need more seats, sometimes too many for good sound. And many must
accommodate a variety of performances, from symphonic music to opera
to drama, with varying needs.
   Changes in a hall can also wreak sonic havoc, though it is not
always clear why. In Carnegie's case, one theory is that the new
floor, stage, carpet, paint and plaster ``stiffened'' the
auditorium, increasing reverberation. Another blames the removal of
stage curtains and the filling of a hole in the acoustic shell over
the stage _ moves intended to improve the sound in the front rows.
   Whatever the cause, the result was a loss of deep bass resonance
and a reverberation that can verge on echo. Even more seriously,
some musicians have complained of some difficulty hearing each other.
   Despite some well-publicized fiascos, acousticians and architects
are better equipped than ever, and experts say the results are
particularly apparent in halls on college campuses and in smaller
communities.
   Acousticians have learned how to shape walls that scatter sound
in the fashion of three-dimensional wall surfaces. They also use
``quadratic residue diffusers'' _ textured panels mounted on
ceilings or walls that splay sound out around a room.
   Lasers can show how light waves bounce around a room, giving a
clue to how sound waves move through the same space; computers make
it feasible to compile and analyze huge amounts of sound test data;
models can highlight gross defects before construction.
   The designers of the Orange County, Calif., Performing Arts
Center, for example, built a one-tenth scale model out of the same
materials as the actual building. They inserted tiny microphones and
ran sound tests to make sure the unusual asymmetric design reflected
sound to the audience soon enough.
   Electronically assisted resonance was first used in 1964 at the
Royal Festival Hall in London, whose acoustic problems stemmed from
a ceiling 12 feet too low. Rather than raise the roof, management
installed a series of speakers, each with a microphone and an
amplifier tuned to a certain low-frequency band. The result was
increased reverberation.
   A more recent development is something called a reflected energy
system, which picks up the sound from the stage and processes it
electronically to add sonic reflections. Since such systems can be
tinkered with, some critics worry that natural sound will be lost in
the search for perfect sound. But advocates say that given the
conflicting demands on the multi-purpose concert hall, nature can
use a little help.

<HEAD>Contaminated Acupuncture Needles Apparently Caused AIDS Case</HEAD>

   A 17-year-old French boy who came down with AIDS
apparently got it from contaminated acupuncture needles, researchers
said today.
   The researchers said they believe that the incidence of AIDS
spread through acupuncture is very low. ``However, acupuncturists
must be aware of the risk,'' they said in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The researchers, from the Necker Hospital in Paris and the
Charles Foix Hospital in Ivry, France, said the boy they studied had
never had sexual intercourse and had never had a blood transfusion.
   He sought treatment for acupuncture after developing tendonitis
while training to play rugby, said the researchers, who included D.
Vittecoq of Necker Hospital and J.P. Bouchon of Charles Foix
Hospital.
   Last March, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
reported the identification of two cases of AIDS in people with no
risk factors who had received acupuncture.

   Sir Edmund Hillary says Mount Everest
should get a rest.
   Why? Because it's there _ as are the armies of explorers elbowing
each other up and down the mountain in all types of weather and
leaving behind their trash.
   Hillary, one of the first two men to climb the world's tallest
peak, suggests a moratorium on the mountain, with no one scaling
Everest for five years.
   ``There have been far too many expeditions jostling their way up
Mount Everest,'' Hillary said Wednesday in an interview with The
Associated Press. ``You find them in pre-monsoon, post-monsoon and
even in winter season from various sides of the mountain. And a a
great deal of rubbish and junk has been left on the mountain.''
   Hillary, who is New Zealand's ambassador to Nepal and India,
climbed Everest with Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay in 1953. Since
then, the 29,028-foot mountain has been conquered 260 times, both
from the Nepal and Tibet sides.
   ``You know nature has a great ability to rehabilitate itself and
I believe that if the mountain was closed down for expeditions for
five years that much of rubbish would disappear down under the snow,
down into the basin,'' said Hillary, 69. ``And the mountain would
become rather cleaner and more wholesome again.
   ``I think we owe it to the mountain not to constantly harass it
as it has been in the past 10 or 15 years,'' he added.
   An official at the Ministry of Tourism, which issues climbing
permits, said climbers have sought to reserve Everest through the
end of the century.
   The official refused to comment on Hillary's suggestion of a
temporary ban on expeditions, but noted that Nepal's regulations
call for climbers to clean up after themselves before they leave the
mountain.
   Glenn Porzak, president of the American Alpine Club, said the
issue was discussed at his organization's recent annual meeting.
   ``The consensus feeling was that that was not the solution to the
problem,'' he said in Boulder, Colo. ``The solution was to educate
each of the expeditions that go to Everest and to instill in them
more of an environmental ethic so they bring down all of what they
take up to the mountain.''
   Porzak said P.M. Shrestha, undersecretary of tourism in Nepal,
has indicated that closing the mountain is not under consideration.
If anything, ``they're definitely going the other way,'' Porzak
said, noting that Nepal has been issuing more climbing permits and
that it relies on the revenue.
   Nepal and China have been allowing more than one expedition on
the same route at the same time, he said. ``So there's a whole lot
more traffic, and with the traffic there's a greater potential for
some expeditions to leave their gear on the mountain once they're
done,'' Porzak said. ``I would favor limiting the number of teams on
the mountain.
   ``But closing off the mountain for five years would be a little
bit akin to what (President) Carter did in terms of boycotting the
Olympics. That's not the ultimate solution,'' added Porzak, who is
leaving in a month and a half to climb Everest.
   George Band, president of London's Alpine Club, the world's
oldest mountaineering society, says that instead of a five-year
moratorium, ``it may be a more practical gesture to have not more
than two or three expeditions to each mountain at a time each
season.''
   ``On Everest there are two seasons before and after the monsoon
which breaks in June, so climbers are tackling the mountain in May
or October,'' said Band, who was in Hillary's 1953 expedition. He
added that worst problem was increased numbers of Sherpas cooking
with firewood and depleting the shrubbery, which could cause erosion.
   Hillary said that because hundreds have climbed Everest ``we
can't feel sorry for those who may not get the opportunity over the
next few years.''
   ``After all, for many, many years when Everest was being
attempted (before 1953), nobody was successful in climbing it,'' he
said. ``But it has now been climbed more than 200 times, so how can
one say that one is a bit unlucky? ... Let them wait for five
years.''
   Everest ``gets more rough treatment than any other peak'' because
there are expeditions from both the Nepalese and Chinese sides and
people tend to stay on it longer because it is the tallest, he said.
   ``So I feel it would be good to at least set the example ...
(and) choose Everest, the biggest of all the peaks, and let it rest
for five years. And then maybe let people come back again.''

<HEAD>Families Claim Prisoners Tortured After Rights Groups Report Ill
Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 15 political prisoners were beaten
and put in solitary confinement because their complaints of ill
treatment were published by Amnesty International and other human
rights groups, relatives say.
   More than a dozen relatives of prisoners interviewed over the
past week told The Associated Press the 15 inmates began a hunger
strike Jan. 19 to protest their treatment at Jordan's newly built
Swaqa prison.
   Interior Minister Rajai Dajani on Wednesday denied the
allegations. ``It is not true at all,'' he said in comments relayed
by Information Minister Hani Khasawneh.
   He said Swaqa, about 50 miles south of Amman, is a ``reform and
rehabilitation center rather than a prison.''
   Prisoners' relatives say Swaqa holds 163 political prisoners,
most of them members of leftist or extremist Palestinian factions.
Several of those groups advocate or have attempted the overthrow of
King Hussein, the Jordanian leader.
   The relatives spoke on condition of anonymity, saying some of
them were warned by security services not to speak about the matter.
   They said the Swaqa prison director summoned all political
prisoners Jan. 17 and told them officials were angered by reports
from Amnesty International and other human rights groups about
torture and detention without trial.
   Relatives said 15 of the prisoners were called in front of the
group and some were beaten on the soles of their feet while others
were beaten while suspended backward over a pole with their hands
bound to their feet.
   The heads wethe 15 were then shaved and they were placed into
solitary confinement, the relatives said. They said at least three
other prisoners have since joined those in solitary confinement.
   In a Dec. 14 report, Amnesty called on Jordan to hold ``a full
and independent investigation'' of reported beatings and at least
one flogging at Swaqa in October. The London-based organization
noted such treatment would be a violation of Jordanian law.
   In November reports, Amnesty expressed concern about the
detention without trial of 22 alleged members of the Marxist Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine. It said ``most, if not all of
them appear to have been tortured'' during their interrogation at
the General Intelligence Department in Amman.
   Relatives of the political prisoners said two of those beaten and
confined last week were among the seven mentioned in the December
Amnesty report: Maher Abu Ayash and Jamal Ibralim Ali Nsour.
   The relatives said about 80 political prisoners are held at the
General Intelligence Department in Amman and 21 at the army prison
in Zarqa, east of the capital.
   Human rights groups have reported instances of torture in most
Middle Eastern countries and Jordan is generally considered to use
it less than most. Jordanian judges sometimes reject the confessions
of mistreated defendants, according to lawyers in Amman.

   Israeli media allege a ``Palestinian popular
army'' is being financed and armed by Yasser Arafat's faction of the
PLO, but some Palestinians say the army exists largely on paper.
   Israeli security forces Tuesday arrested dozens of people
suspected of belonging to the alleged army.
   Some Palestinians say the ``popular army'' is an attempt to
coordinate groups of activists who enforce general strikes, patrol
neighborhoods and punish collaborators in the 13-month uprising
against Israeli rule of the occupied territories.
   Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab said Tuesday that Israel was
blowing the significance of the issue out of proportion for its
publicity value.
   ``It's a game of semantics,'' he said of the term ``popular
army.''
   Kuttab, who has wide contacts in the Palestine Liberation
Organization, called existing groups of activists ``strike forces''
that use stones, not guns, in their clashes with Israeli soldiers.
   In announcing Tuesday's arrests, Israeli military officials said
the ``popular army'' was led by Fatah, Arafat's arm of the PLO.
   Israel claims Arafat lied when, as part of a diplomatic
initiative, he said last month that the PLO renounced terrorism and
recognized the Jewish state.
   The key suspect in the arrests, Abdel Fatah Hassan, received
weapons and money from Fatah and trained dozens of youths for
attacks against Israeli troops and civilians, Israel radio said.
   The squads were based in the town of Tulkarem in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and were to train ``hundreds of others''
in the territory, according to the radio.
   An Israeli army spokesman said he did not know what kind of
weapons were involved.
   An army official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
PLO continually tries to smuggle money and arms into the West Bank
and occupied Gaza Strip.
   The official said he did not know the size and scope of activity
of the ``popular army,'' but that the Israeli army did not see it as
a sign that the Palestinian uprising was becoming an armed struggle.
   A recent PLO statement said the ``popular army'' was being formed
under the auspices of Fatah's Force-17 and had thousands of members
in the occupied lands.
   A leaflet circulated last week announced the formation of the
``Palestinian Popular Army'' and urged attacks on Israeli soldiers
and Jewish settlers.
   Still, there have been no indications of an armed military force
in the occupied lands since the rebellion began in December 1987.
   In recent months, Palestinian youths, often wearing identical
jackets or black, plastic garbage bags done up as ponchos have
staged ``military marches'' in towns and villages. Some were armed
with clubs, slingshots and hatchets.
   One such march took place Jan. 1 in the village of Abu Falah on
the West Bank. Residents said 300 to 400 youths took part, and drew
2,500 spectators in the local schoolyard.
   A video of the parade viewed by The Associated Press showed
youths carrying outlawed Palestinian flags. Marchers wore keffiyehs,
the checkered Arab headdress considered a symbol of Palestinian
nationalism, but the youths were not dressed uniformly. Some were
pre-teens who appeared to be playing soldier games.
   Three TV crews reportedly filmed the parade, and residents
sprayed slogans in English and Hebrew on walls near the schoolyard,
apparently for the benefit of the journalists. A Hebrew slogan read:
``Long live Abu Amar,'' Arafat's code name.
   Kuttab and other Palestinians said such military posturing did
not mean a real Palestinian army existed. ``This is more of a
symbolic gesture'' to keep up morale among residents, he said.
   Some Palestinians suggested, however, that improved coordination
among strike forces could serve as the seed for a broad-based
guerrilla force if the uprising drags on.
   Some PLO factions in the underground Unified National Leadership
of the Uprising reportedly oppose the notion of a ``popular army,''
arguing it would only serve as propaganda fodder for the Israelis
and possibly provoke Israeli reprisals.
   If there was feuding over the issue, the opponents appear to have
won.
   Kuttab noted that no mention of the ``popular army'' was made in
the Unified Leadership's latest leaflet, which was circulated Monday
in the occupied lands.

   As one of the most powerful union leaders, Basnett forced Edward
Heath, then Conservative prime minister, to abandon a ban on pay
negotiations during an official wage freeze policy in 1973.
   But his union's militancy against pay restraint under a Labor

the first black to head a major political party in the United States.
   Brown's ascension to the Democratic Party chairmanship became all
but certain Wednesday when he was endorsed by his chief rival for
the post.
   It was a remarkably swift triumph for the 47-year-old political
veteran who grew up in Harlem but attended predominantly white
schools on New York's Upper East Side.
   His parents were graduates of Howard University, one of the
nation's premier black colleges, but they sent their only child to
Middlebury College in Vermont, where he was one of the few blacks.
He now serves on the college's board of trustees and is chairman of
the board of the Kennedy Institute for Politics at Harvard.
   Brown worked for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and studied law under
Mario Cuomo. His ties to the Democratic Party's liberal wing are
firm, and were cited by opponents to his bid for the party
chairmanship.
   Former Rep. Jim Jones of Oklahoma, who said he was remaining in
the race at least long enough to assess if he had a chance to win,
said the question for Democrats is ``whether we're going to be
perceived as mainstream or to the left of the mainstream.''
   The breakthrough for Brown came when Richard Wiener, chairman of
the Michigan Democratic Party, abruptly announced, ``I am ending my
campaign for Democratic National chair.''
   ``From the outset of my campaign, I have stated that the next
chair of our party would be either myself or Ron Brown _ and
properly so. By taking this action today, I believe that this race
has effectively ended and that Ron Brown will achieve a first-ballot
victory.''
   The Democratic National Committee will elect the new chairman on
Feb. 10.
   In a statement thanking Wiener for his support, Brown said, ``I
now have more than enough votes to win the chair of the DNC. I am
very, very pleased and look forward to leading a united party for
the next four years.''
   He said his first priority would be ``to reach out to all
Democrats. Our strength as a party depends upon our ability to
appeal to Americans in every region with a message of strength and
hope.''
   The only other candidate remaining in the race was former Rep.
James Stanton of Ohio, who had no immediate comment on the latest
development.
   Assuming that Brown succeeds Paul G. Kirk Jr. as chairman, he may
face tough sledding achieving his goal of uniting the party,
particularly in the South.
   ``Ron is probably the most qualified guy in the race,'' said
Florida Democratic Party chairman Charles Whitehead. ``But the
perception in this state is that Ron is Jesse's and Ted's and
labor's guy. ... It poses a political problem a little bit in
Florida.''
   But Whitehead said he would do ``anything I can to help Ron
overcome that perception.''
   Less amenable to a Brown victory was Alabama chairman John Baker,
who has said it would represent a triumph for the ``ultra-liberal''
wing of the party. Baker said he would ignore a national party
headed by Brown.
   Southern opponents of Brown argued that election of a liberal as
chairman would drive from the Democratic Party those whites who have
remained loyal _ a dwindling bloc in recent elections.
   Brown has portrayed the opposition to his candidacy as racially
motivated.
   ``People will look you in the face and say you have the
credentials for the job, but ...,'' he said. ``It is race-conscious
behavior.''
   He said the only way to overcome that attitude is ``to put light
on it and make people address it.''
   For a decade Brown moved smoothly through the capital's corridors
of power, winning ready acceptance when he ran the Urban League's
Washington office and then as Kennedy's general counsel and staff
director on the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   He was deputy manager of Kennedy's unsuccessful challenge of
President Jimmy Carter for the 1980 Democratic presidential
nomination.
   When that campaign ended, Brown accepted an offer to become a
partner in one of the capital's major law firms. With clients that
included the Japanese electronics industry and the government of
Haiti, Brown earned a six-figure salary and drove a Jaguar.
   He and his wife, Alma, have a son, Michael, who is in law school,
and a daughter, Tracy, who is a senior at Boston College.
   While pursuing his lucrative law practice, Brown remained active
in Democratic Party affairs.
   Jackson was rebuffed when he tried to recruit Brown to manage his
presidential campaign. But in May 1988, when only Jackson and
Michael Dukakis remained in the race, Brown agreed to serve as
Jackson's convention manager.
   While Democrats were certain Dukakis would be their nominee they
were troubled by the question, ``What does Jesse want?'' Jackson was
sending mixed signals about the vice presidential nomination and his
demands for platform planks.
   But Brown managed to deflect a potentially divisive platform
debate over Middle East policy and was instrumental in arranging the
convention's closing-night show of unity, when Jackson and his
family joined Dukakis at the podium.

<HEAD>House Knew of Diversion Despite Being Misled by North, Motion Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House aide Oliver North has
subpoenaed two House members and a pile of congressional documents
in an apparent attempt to show he could not have misled Congress
about his activities because lawmakers already knew what he was
doing.
   The defense in the Iran-Contra case wants Reps. Lee Hamilton,
D-Ind., and Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., to testify in court about their
dealings with North in 1985 and 1986 on the subject of whether the
United States was aiding the Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government.
   ``I'm willing to cooperate to the extent I have any direct
knowledge,'' McCurdy said Wednesday in a brief interview. He said he
assumed the defense was primarily interested in his account of an
Aug. 6, 1986, meeting of House Intelligence Committee members with
North in the White House situation room.
   Hamilton had no comment on the subpoena. But when broad
conspiracy charges against North were dropped earlier this month,
Hamilton said the remaining counts amounted to a strong criminal
case against the retired Marine lieutenant colonel. The remaining
counts against North include charges of lying to Congress.
   Two Intelligence Committee staff members also have been
subpoenaed by North's lawyers, along with documents from the
Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees.
   At the White House meeting with lawmakers in August 1986, North
concealed the U.S. role in resupplying the Nicaraguan rebels, and
admitted when he testified before congressional investigating
committees in 1987 that he had done so.
   But North's defense apparently intends to show that Congress knew
about the supply effort, either from other sources or from
information disclosed by North himself on other occasions, according
to the House response.
   McCurdy, however, said he he knew nothing about North's
involvement with the resupply effort until disclosure of the
Iran-Contra scandal three months after the White House meeting.
   In a 22-page motion to quash portions of the subpoenas for
documents, House counsel Steven R. Ross argued that they were too
broad and based on an ``incredible'' theory that North was only
concealing things the committees already knew.
   North ``reasons that hence no crimes occurred, for what the House
knew, North could not conceal from it,'' the motion argued.
``Congress has not legalized obstruction ... on the grounds that
others may make up the truth deficit.''
   At a court hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell
said subpoenaing congressmen must be approached with ``some degree
of accommodation'' and that ``we're not going to pull them off the
floor'' of Congress to testify at North's trial, which is scheduled
to begin Tuesday.
   At the time of the White House meeting, Hamilton was Intelligence
Committee chairman and McCurdy was a member of the panel. Hamilton
is no longer a member, but McCurdy recently rejoined the committee.
   A hearing was scheduled for Friday to hear all objections to
North's subpoenas, including those seeking testimony from former
President Reagan and President Bush.
   In his motion to quash parts of the document subpoenas, Ross said
the House cannot be compelled to submit its investigative files to
outside inquiries, but would be willing to do so where the material
is relevant to prosecution or defense of charges involving crimes
where the House is a victim.
   ``We have no desire to withhold evidence which is material and
relevant,'' Ross said.
   North was seeking everything the House committees have regarding
providing support to the Contras by private benefactors, third
countries, John Singlaub, Robert Owen, who was North's courier to
the Contras, and co-defendant Richard Secord, whom North enlisted to
run the resupply operation.
   North subpoenaed the whole set of records of the intelligence
panel's probe of the Contra resupply operation, which began after a
Contra resupply plane with American crewman Eugene Hasenfus aboard
was shot down in Nicaragua in October 1986.
   Four of the 12 criminal charges remaining against North are that
in 1985 he concealed from Congress his efforts on behalf of the
Contras to raise funds, arrange arms shipments and offer tactical
advice.
   Another count says he concealed similar information at the White
House meeting, and he is charged additionally with obstructing
Congress in November 1986 by altering, destroying and concealing
documents on the Iran arms shipments and aid to the Contras.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Optimistic About Prospects for Housing Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressmen say they believe the Bush
administration will pay more attention to housing problems than
Reagan did, and several bills are in the works to outline the
programs and find ways to pay for them.
   Being counted among the reasons for optimism is Bush's selection
of a former member of the House, Jack Kemp, for secretary of Housing
and Urban Development.
   ``I'm delighted he has been chosen,'' Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., chairman of the housing subcommittee of the Senate
Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said Wednesday. ``I
think he's very bright and knows how the legislative process works.''
   Cranston said he and other members of the committee have met with
Kemp and feel he is interested in housing problems and receptive to
their ideas despite differences they have with some of Kemp's past
proposals.
   Kemp has supported the transfer and sale of public housing to
tenants, housing vouchers as a way of giving low-income tenants
expanded choices in the private market and urban enterprise zones to
encourage economic development in the inner cities.
   Cranston and New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the ranking
Republican on the housing panel, plan to co-sponsor a comprehensive
housing bill designed to help the homeless, the first-time
homembuyer, low-and moderate-income people and the elderly and
handicapped.
   The proposal would cost $3.1 billion in the first year, Cranston
said, but ``you can't do anything without funds.''
   Many on Capitol Hill say they're encouraged that Bush and Kemp
seem amenable to restoring some federal funds that had been cut
under Reagan.
   Federal funds for low-income housing have been cut 75 percent
since 1981, and Reagan's 1990 budget request includes only half the
funding authorized by Congress under the Stewart B. McKinney
Homeless Assistance Act.
   Bush pledged full funding of the McKinney Act during the
presidential campaign, and Kemp has said he believes the 1986 tax
reform may have gone too far in reducing incentives for the
construction and rehabilitation of affordable housing.
   Legislation being developed by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., would begin to
address Kemp's concern by making permanent the tax credits which
were set to expire at the end of this year for investors in
low-income housing.
   Bills introduced in the House would duplicate some of the efforts
in the Senate by establishing a national housing trust to provide
assistance to first-time homebuyers, make grants to local
governments to convert closed school building to shelters for the
homeless and expand current programs to provide federal asssitance
for the homeless.

<HEAD>Report Urges National Standards for Match Teaching</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National standards are needed to improve
mathematics teaching in the United States, but a uniform curriculum
such as the kind found in Japan and other countries would be
impractical, the National Research Council said in a report issued
today.
   The report, ``Everybody Counts,'' stressed that standards must be
flexible enough to allow for regional differences and that local
teachers and parents must be deeply involved in decision-making.
   The council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, studied
U.S. mathematics education from kindergarten to graduate school.
   Countries with ``top-down'' systems in which all children in a
certain grade study the same material the same way ``have beaten us
hands-down'' in teaching math, the report says.
   But imitating Japan and other top-down countries will not work
here because of the long U.S. traditions of local initiatives and
decentralized authority, the report said. The answer is to establish
``appropriate national expectations based upon broad public
support.''
   A major step toward national standards is expected early this
year when the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics publishes
``Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics.''
   The upcoming NCTM report is ``the first effort ever to establish
national expectations for school mathematics,'' the research council
says.
   A recent surge of studies and books has underscored growing
concern over the nation's mathematical prowess. The research council
in its report today noted a number of specific problems in the math
education field. Among them:
   _Too many students leave school without knowing enough math for
productive lives. And on average, U.S. students do not master math
basics at a level sufficient to sustain our present technologically
based society.
   _Courses and instruction at our schools and colleges are ``years
behind the times.'' Undergraduate math is ``intellectually stagnant,
overgrown with stale courses.''
   _U.S. students lag far behind students of other nations in math
achievement. Plus it's socially acceptable here to do badly in math,
encouraging low expectations.
   _The shortage of qualified math teachers is more serious than in
any other area of U.S. education and affects all levels from
elementary to graduate school. The shortage of minority math
teachers is particularly acute.
   _Calculators and computers have had ``virtually no impact'' on
instruction despite great potential to enrich it. And standardized
multiple-choice tests are obstacles to teaching higher-thinking
skills and the use of calculators and computers.
   Governors should demand new standards and provide resources to
encourage improvements in math teaching, the report says. Congress
should reward effective programs, while the president should stress
upgraded math education as crucial to national security.
   Students should study math every year and use math in other
classes, while their parents should support teachers who seek
curricular improvements and ``expect homework to be more than
routine computation.''
   Principals should help teachers work together and support
innovation, while the business community should provide internship
opportunities for teachers. And the authors admonish the private
sector: ``Do not steal good teachers by hiring them away.''

<HEAD>Police: Man Bitten While Kissing Snake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREEN RIVER, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said they were led on a search
for an elusive ``snow snake'' by a man who didn't want to admit he
was bitten on the lip by a pet snake he was kissing good night.
   The hunt began early Tuesday after Eric Johnson was bitten and
taken to a hospital in nearby Rock Springs for treatment. Doctors
there demanded to know what kind of snake had bitten him in order to
treat him.
   Johnson and a friend, Shawn MacDonald, 19, initially told police
that Johnson had been walking through town when he saw a snake in
the snow. Authorities said Johnson told them the snake bit him when
he picked it up to look at it.
   Adding to the mystery were slithering shapes Johnson and
MacDonald had made in the snow to add substance to their story,
according to police.
   However, the hunt was called off shortly after doctors told
Johnson he was going to die if they didn't find out what kind of
snake had bitten him, Police Officer Don Holthaus said Wednesday.
   Johnson then confessed that he had been bitten by a Pygmy
rattlesnake belonging to MacDonald and that he had made up the story
of finding one in the snow, police said.
   ``I guess what had happened, they were playing around with the
snake and he (Johnson) said he was going to kiss it good night, and
it kissed him first,'' said Holthaus. ``They were worried the snake
was going to be destroyed, so they drew tracks in the snow.''
   Johnson, who was listed in critical condition for a while, is
recovering, said the officer, and the snake has been returned to
MacDonald.

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Christian enclave is
becoming a test ground for an often violent campaign by Moslem
fundamentalists that challenges the PLO leadership of the
Palestinian uprising.
   Fundamentalists in black ski masks torch the shops of Bethlehem
merchants who refuse to follow strike orders and fight PLO followers
with stones and clubs in an attempt to assert control.
   ``Since we believe that the uprising is God-made, we think the
fundamentalists have the right to lead it,'' said Samer, a
25-year-old Bethlehem barber active in ``Hamas,'' or ``Zeal,'' a
Moslem fundamentalist group that opposes PLO moves to seek a
compromise with Israel.
   Like others interviewed, Samer gave only his first name for fear
of retribution by rival Palestinians or Israeli troops.
   Friction between the two groups of Palestinians has often erupted
in the occupied lands during the 13-month-old revolt against Israeli
rule. But only in the Bethlehem area is there active resistance to
the fundamentalists, mainly because beleaguered Christians fear
Islamic domination.
   Christian Palestinians are traditionally aligned with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, which advocates a secular,
democratic Palestine.
   About 30,000 Christians live in Bethlehem and the adjacent towns
of Beit Jallah and Beit Sahour, but their influence is being edged
out by the fast-growing Moslem community. About 23,000 Moslems live
in the three towns, and 40,000 others occupy nearby refugee camps
and villages.
   ``The Christians feel their rights are being trampled on by the
fundamentalists,'' said Kamal, a 22-year-old Bethlehem grocery clerk
active in the Fatah faction of PLO chief Yasser Arafat.
   The battle between Hamas and the PLO has been played out mainly
when general strikes are staged by the rival groups. Residents of
Bethlehem, Beit Jallah and Beit Sahour have repeatedly defied Hamas
strike orders.
   Three months ago, Hamas strike-enforcers battled PLO leftists who
encouraged merchants to defy a Hamas strike.
   ``When the merchants saw they had support ... they started
calling Hamas names,'' Samer said. ``Our people and the (PLO
leftists) started throwing stones at each other.''
   In another incident, a clash erupted between the two sides in
Manger Square, the city's tourist center near where the Bible says
Jesus was born.
   Hamas stepped up retaliatory attacks after Bethlehem merchants
stayed open during a Hamas strike Dec. 31. Later that day, masked
Hamas enforcers torched a shoe store and a parked bus and tried to
set fire to a toy shop.
   The violence and threats have produced results.
   During a Hamas strike last Sunday, Bethlehem merchants for the
first time kept their shops closed without pressure from enforcers,
though their colleagues in Beit Jallah and Beit Sahour were again
defiant.
   Bethlehem's market near Manger Square was deserted except for
sidewalk vendors selling bread and newspapers, which is allowed
during strikes. Taxis and buses stopped running, and slogans
scribbled on walls read: ``Today is a strike day. We warn you to
close your shops.''
   Salem, an owner of two bakeries, said he kept his shop shut for
the first time during a Hamas strike.
   ``I'm afraid they'll burn my shops down,`` he said. ``Last week,
I got a letter of warning because I had opened on a previous
strike.''
   George, a Christian who owns three groceries, said he complied
with the strike after assailants smashed his car window last week
and left behind a note reading: ``This time it is the window, and
the next time it will be your shops.''
   PLO activists have accused Hamas of harming the uprising by
fueling division, but Hamas defends its tactics.
   ``We are trying to show our presence, and we have to use force,''
said Samer, sitting in his immaculate barber shop, occasionally
stroking his neatly trimmed black beard.
   Frictions between the rivals increased last month after Arafat
launched his diplomatic initiative by recognizing Israel and
renouncing terrorism.
   Such concessions are anathema to the fundamentalists, who call
for a ``holy war'' against Israel and demand an Islamic state in all
of former Palestine, including Israeli territory.
   ``What was taken by force must be returned by force,'' said
Samer. ``Palestine must be an Islamic state.''
   Breaking the PLO's grip in Bethlehem would be a major victory for
the fundamentalists, who have a strong following in the occupied
Gaza Strip and have also made inroads elsewhere in the West Bank.
   Samer, a born-again Moslem who defected from Arafat's Fatah,
claims fundamentalists now outnumber PLO activists in Bethlehem and
nearby Christian towns.
   Others disagree. ``Hamas as no support in these places,'' said
Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian journalist with wide PLO contacts. He
said PLO factions elsewhere chose not to fight Hamas only to keep
the uprising unified.
   Kamal, the Fatah activist, said the battle in Bethlehem is not
over. ``We'll stop Hamas,'' he declared.

<HEAD>Guardian Angels Ruffle Feathers In Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fledgling Guardian Angels have begun earning their
wings under the guidance of founder Curtis Sliwa, whose
crime-fighting group is catching as much criticism in Britain as on
the other side of the Atlantic.
   Sliwa and three fellow Angels, wearing their trademark red
berets, told 22 recruits at a London gym on Wednesday to be careful
out there.
   ``Flash and panache just won't work, you gotta remain cool and
calm,'' the New Yorker told the new recruits. ``You don't have to be
a muscle man to be an Angel.''
   The group began in New York by patrolling the city's subway
system and branched out into 60 cities in the United States, Canada
and Mexico. Typically, local law enforcement officials resent the
group's presence.
   London has been no different.
   Critics of the group say they are opposed to the Guardian Angels'
plans to patrol the London Underground, the subway system plagued by
a recent rise in crime.
   ``Such a move will undoubtedly increase the level of insecurity
and tension on the underground and could lead to gang wars and more
violent incidents,'' said John Prescott, in charge of transport for
the opposition Labor Party.
   The Angels, he said, could become sitting ducks. ``Hunting the
red beret vigilantes could become a late night weekend sport.''
   Romany Rix, a 16-year-old London recruit, said she believed in
Sliwa's philosophy.
   ``I'm no butch or bully but through the Angels I can help rid
London of crime the gentle way,'' she said after Sliwa explained the
three-month training course in law, fitness, self-defense and
psychology.
   Despite the criticism, Sliwa maintained the public supports the
idea of Guardian Angels in Britain.
   He and his wife and co-founder, Lisa Sliwa, toured London,
Manchester and Birmingham for two weeks last fall to sound out their
ideas.
   ``So many people tell us they will no longer use the tube
(subway), they never see any security, they would welcome people in
red berets,'' said Sliwa, who was questioned for seven hours by
customs officials at Gatwick Airport on Tuesday before he and the
other Angels were granted six-month visas.
   A spokesman for the Home Office, which is responsible for law
enforcement, said ``the implications of a uniformed squad acting
outside the properly authorized police forces is offensive to many
citizens and could in fact promote confrontation and disorder.
   ``So long as they keep within the law, however, there are no
powers to prevent their traveling as normal fare-paying passengers
on the tube,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   Former President Reagan's re-election committee
agreed to pay $25,000 to settle a free-speech lawsuit by 17
protesters who were barred from a 1984 campaign rally, attorneys say.
   Under the out-of-court settlement reached Tuesday, the
demonstrators will receive $800 apiece after legal fees and costs,
plaintiffs' attorney Robert Newman said Wednesday.
   The Reagan-Bush '84 Committee admitted no wrongdoing in the
settlement of the U.S. District Court lawsuit, said committee
attorney W. Stuart Dornette.
   Police and Secret Service agents, saying they were acting at the
request of rally organizers, barred the 17 from the Aug. 20, 1984,
event at the public Fountain Square Plaza because they were carrying
anti-Reagan signs, the plaintiffs said.
   Those permitted inside metal barriers set up to restrict access
to the square were given pro-Reagan signs, the lawsuit said.

<DATELINE>BEDFORD, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convenience store owner says he set fire to
hundreds of X-rated videotapes after seeing a television interview
in which serial killer Ted Bundy said he was ``guided and shaped''
by pornography.
   ``They're rotten filth,'' Kenneth Patterson said Wednesday before
igniting a barrel filled with the tapes. ``I don't want to send them
back. I want to burn them. I just want to pour a can of gasoline on
them. I don't want anyone to see them.''
   Bundy, who confessed to murdering 23 women, was executed in
Florida on Tuesday for the 1978 rape and murder of a 12-year-old
girl.
   In an interview with religious broadcaster James C. Dobson
shortly before his death, the 42-year-old Bundy said he was
influenced by an addiction to hard-core pornography. Pornography, he
warned, ``can reach out and snatch a kid out of any house today.''
   ``He said there's people like him who watch these movies and a
part of their brain snaps,'' said Patterson, a father of two. ``You
think of your kids, other people's kids. We just discontinued
renting them and any kind of pornography completely.''
   ``I don't need it. Society doesn't need it. We're going to stick
with the family type.''
   Patterson, who has been renting X-rated movies at his Bedford
Minute Market for about five years, said he doesn't care if he loses
customers.
   ``I don't want any part of this type of garbage,'' he said.
   ``Those kids are more important than money. I might lose some
business but I think I'll gain in the long run. Money is not the
question,'' said Patterson, who didn't specify how much the tapes
had cost him.

   A veteran Cuban diplomat who defected to the
United States says he was a regular participant in a
Palestinian-backed gun-running operation on behalf of rebel groups
in three Latin American countries.
   Hector Aguililla Saladrigas, who spent most of his 14-year
diplomatic career involved in Middle East affairs, said he defected
last fall after becoming disillusioned with Cuba's subversive
activities and widespread official corruption.
   Aguililla's defection was not publicly disclosed until the State
Department made him available for an interview Tuesday with The
Associated Press.
   He had been assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Madagascar but last
Oct. 10, during a transit stop while en route to take up his duties
there, he asked U.S. officials for political asylum for himself, his
wife and two children, aged 13 and 10. He declined to say where the
request was made.
   Much of his time since his defection has been spent in CIA
debriefings.
   Aguililla, 35, offered a rare glimpse into the role Cuba has
played in cooperation with Palestinian radicals in the shadowy
international arms trafficking business.
   He said that with Palestinian help, Cuba arranged for the
transport of large quantities of Western-made weaponry to guerrilla
groups in El Salvador, Guatemala and Chile and also provides
training of a ``terrorist nature'' to Palestinian militants.
   Aguililla said that between 1980 and 1983 while he served as the
second ranking official at the Cuban Embassy in Damascus, he
routinely made trips to Lebanon's Bekaa Valley where the trunk of
his car was loaded with rifles, pistols, revolvers and smoke bombs.
   He said Palestinian groups, particularly two pro-Marxist
factions, were the principal source of weaponry, which he was able
to transport back to Syria without a customs check because of the
diplomatic plates on his car.
   On occasion, he said, a top Cuban intelligence officer flew to
Damascus for larger-scale arms transfers.
   Weapons of U.S., Israeli or Italian manufacture were favored
because ``socialist involvement'' in the arms trafficking scheme
could thus be concealed, he said.
   ``The Palestinians were a good source of Western arms because
they had a lot of contacts to get them,'' he added.
   ``The policy of Cuba has always been to export the revolution,''
Aguililla said as he recounted his experiences in the 75-minute
interview. He referred on occasion to a single page of typewritten
notes he used as a memory aid.
   Speaking in Spanish while chain-smoking cigarettes, Aguililla
said he does not know if the arms smuggling operation by way of
Syria continued beyond 1983 because he left the country in early
1984. Since then he served brief stints at the Cuban embassies in
Iran and Kuwait.
   Aguililla said he was troubled by evidence of widespread official
corruption in Cuba, a problem that has been acknowledged by
President Fidel Castro.
   But Castro nonetheless contends that the revolution has produced
hundreds of thousands of selfless individuals who volunteer for
social welfare projects at home and in numerous Third World
countries.
   The Cuban diplomatic mission here was apprised of Aguililla's
allegations on Wednesday but spokesman Angel Pino refused comment.
   According to Aguililla, Wilma Espin, a member of the Politburo
and head of the Federation of Cuban Women, once helped herself
during a visit to Damascus to a fund that embassy women had
contributed to for parties and toys for children and used the money
for shopping.
   Orlando Fundora, formerly the chief ideologue of the revolution,
stopped once in Damascus, Aguililla said, and asked him to exchange
money on the black market.
   ``He was supposed to be the model of socialist morality but
nonetheless he violated the law of that country,'' Aguililla added.
   As a cost-cutting measure, the Cuban Foreign Ministry sent
dollars in cash to the embassy in Tehran with the understanding that
the currency would be exchanged on the black market at windfall
profit rates.
   An enterprising group of Cuban diplomats in Peru shipped frozen
beef via the diplomatic pouch to co-conspirators at the Foreign
Ministry in Havana, Aguililla said, adding that the beef was then
sold privately at a hefty profit.

<TEXT>
   President Bush gave an interview to a pair of
reporters then had the transcript released to the White House press
corps as part of his effort to make himself more accessible in
exchange for limiting shouted questions.
   Bush was interviewed Wednesday in the Oval Office by two
reporters _ from The New York Times and The Houston Post. The
journalists then wrote a ``pool report'' relaying the gist of the
president's remarks to their colleagues. The White House also
released a transcript of the interview.
   Only after Bush gave the interview did press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater hold his daily news briefing. He was joined there by chief
of staff John Sununu, making his first appearance in the White House
press room.
   Fitzwater said Bush planned to follow up on Wednesday's interview
by granting more such question-and-answer sessions to small groups
of reporters. He also said the White House was considering excluding
reporters from some events at which Bush is being photographed.
   ``Well, we'll see how it goes,'' the spokesman told reporters who
raised several questions about that alternative. ``We're looking for
various alternative ways of letting the press ask questions of the
president. This is just one technique.''
   During his transition to the presidency, Bush had served notice
that he would not permit spontaneous questions during such sessions.
Such questioning occurred regularly during the Reagan years,
particularly when the president posed for pictures with visiting
foreign leaders, Cabinet members of congressional leaders.
   Bush also pledged that he would be fully accessible to the media,
saying reporters would feel less need to shout questions during
these occasions and thus behave in a more dignified manner. But he
never committed himself to a specific number of formal news
conferences.
   Former President Ronald Reagan occasionally granted Oval Office
interviews, but seldom agreed to have a group of reporters _ a
``pool'' _ come in and question him and subsequently report his
remarks to their colleagues.
   Reagan, however, seemed to enjoy the spontaneous exchanges with
reporters during picture-taking sessions and while he was getting on
and off helicopters and airplanes.
   Former President Gerald R. Ford often agreed to talk to
reporters, with little advance notice, and even held
question-and-answer sessions on the White House grounds.

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can play in Peoria, but if you're in a
bit of a fix, you'll have to pay.
   As of Wednesday, the police and fire departments stopped rescuing
kittens from trees, pumping flooded basements or handling any number
of extra duties that once were considered routine. The new policy
has prompted some to wonder if this quintessential Midwest town is
losing its heartland values.
   ``Peoria's definitely losing its small-town flavor but we think
it's more important to be prepared to respond to emergencies rather
than spending time and money on extracurricular activities like
these,'' says Fire Marshal G. John Parker.
   Parker explained that financial concerns prompted officials to
stop helping residents who are locked out of their homes, or
motorists who have locked their keys inside their cars _ unless it's
an emergency.
   ``It is a sign of the times,'' Parker said. ``We just can't do
all the things we traditionally have done. ...
   ``Peoria has continued to provide these services while other
communities of this size eliminated them long ago. We need to be
more concerned about protecting citizens' lives and property.
Especially in the face of reduced manpower and budget cuts.''
   Chicago police said they stopped opening car doors long ago.
   ``We tell them to go to a locksmith. It's been that way during my
12 years on the police force,'' said a Chicago police official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Some here see the change as a sign that city government is
getting too big in Peoria, the state's third-largest city with
127,000 residents.
   Councilman James Polk is fighting the change because he doesn't
want Peoria to lose its identity.
   ``Peoria is big enough to offer a lot of the same opportunities
as a city like Chicago, yet it's small enough to keep our basic
Midwestern values,'' Polk said.
   ``This program is important because it brings our police officers
and firefighters closer to the people. They provide an essential
public service and it helps develop respect in the community for the
police.''
   Some won't mind the changes.
   At a minimum $20 to open a locked car, locksmiths will welcome
the 5,899 calls received last year at the Peoria Police Department.
The fire department answered 80 calls last year from locked-out
residents.
   No longer will the locksmiths have to monitor police radios to
listen for distress calls from motorists and try to beat police to
the scene. Instead, the city will simply forward the calls to
private businesses on a rotating basis.
   The private sector's gain will be a relief to Parker, who said
his department is struggling to survive on $7.2 million a year and
was forced to cut 12 of its 170 firefighters last year.
   ``I don't feel that we have any choice,'' Parker said.
   ``We don't have the luxury for these types of services anymore.
We have to make sure our machines and manpower are in position to
respond to true emergencies. But, I'm sure we'll hear a lot of
criticism.''

<HEAD>Congressmen Urge That Drug Czar Be Cabinet Post</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The decision to deny drug czar-designate
William J. Bennett a place in the Cabinet calls into question the
President Bush's commitment to the war on drugs, say congressmen who
are urging him to reconsider.
   ``If the administration is going to keep the high profile it says
drugs is going to be, then I think there has to be room at the table
so that at every Cabinet meeting, there is a presence at the table
of this problem,'' said Rep. Bob Dornan, R-Calif.
   And Sen. Joseph Biden Jr., D-Del., who fought for years to create
a drug czar post to ride herd over the numerous federal agencies
involved in the drug war, complained that the decision ``would
relegate the drug issue to sub-Cabinet status.''
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater indicated Wednesday
the decision would not change.
   ``I haven't talked to him, but Bill Bennett's position has very
specific statutory responsibilities, quite powerful and
far-reaching, and I don't think he has any concern about Cabinet
status,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The president can confer Cabinet status upon anyone he wants,
but he would like to keep the Cabinet small, and I don't think Bill
Bennett is upset,'' he said.
   When Bennett was appointed Jan. 12 to the job of director of
National Drug Control Policy, he said he looked forward to working
with ``my colleagues in the Cabinet.''
   But Bennett aide John Walters said Bennett didn't consider the
decision a ``serious problem,'' and noted Bush and Bennett had lunch
together Monday.
   ``We have no doubt about George Bush's seriousness about the drug
issue, and his seriousness about his commitment to Bill Bennett as
the guy in charge of this issue for him is a strong as ever,''
Walters said.
   A transition official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Bennett ``was kind of surprised'' to discover he had not been
invited to a Cabinet meeting Monday, but that he ``would like to
have the freedom not to be there.''
   ``He's got a lot of work to do and doesn't need to be there for
discussions of acid rain and the ozone layer,'' he said, referring
to some of the topics that occupied hours of Cabinet meetings when
Bennett was education secretary under President Reagan.
   Several congressmen joked that Bennett was left out of the
Cabinet meeting for want of a chair, and they offered solutions.
   ``We may have to appropriate some money for an extra chair so he
can get into the Cabinet room, but we hope he will be there
alongside the president and have the ear of the president,'' said
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., ranking minority member of the House
Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control.
   Dornan said Congress had anticipated the drug czar would have
Cabinet rank when it created the job by passing the drug bill in
October.
   ``Although we did leave it to the discretion of the president, we
made the new so-called drug czar at the same pay level as all the
other members of the Cabinet and all of the various secretaries,''
he said.

<HEAD>Barristers, Solicitors Tangle on Law Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the bar fear a proposal by Britain's
highest law officer to revamp the legal system will turn it into a
ruthless arena where big firms seduce talent with fat salaries and
the ordinary citizen suffers.
   The lord chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, called Wednesday
for an end to the monopoly of bewigged barristers in the nation's
higher courts so solicitors may argue cases as well.
   He also called for the adoption of contingency fees for civil
suits, meaning lawyers would be paid by clients only if they win a
case.
   Adoption of the proposals would be a wholesale reworking of the
structure of British courts, where solicitors are the general
practitioners who deal with the public and barristers are
specialists who argue cases in higher courts.
   In the English system of law, members of the public take their
cases to solicitors. In minor cases, no other lawyer may be required.
   In serious criminal cases, however, the solicitor is obliged to
hire a barrister to argue the case. Barristers must take any case
sent their way, if their time permits, meaning the country's top
advocates are available to any client.
   Judges in the high courts come from the ranks of barristers, and
the bar regulates itself through traditions whose foundations are
obscured in the mists of the Middle Ages. True to those traditiona,
barristers wear wigs in court.
   Richard Gaskell, president of the Law Society that represents the
nation's 50,000 solicitors, welcomed the new proposals, saying they
addressed ``longstanding problems of a profession operating within
an outdated framework.''
   But Desmond Fennell, chairman of the General Council of the Bar,
strongly protested them, saying they ``will remove the control of
justice from the judges and entrust it to the civil servants.''
   ``The proposals for the licensing of advocates under government
control give rise to grave constitutional dangers,'' he told a news
conference.
   The lord chancellor gave lawyers and other interested parties
until May 2 to comment on the proposals before the government
publishes a ``white paper'' with specific legislation governing the
courts of England and Wales.
   Reflecting Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's enthusiasm for free
markets to solve any number of perceived ills in British society, a
summary issued by the lord chancellor said ``the market in legal
services should be allowed to operate freely so as to give clients
the widest possible choice of cost-effective services.''
   In addition to changing the roles of solicitors and barristers,
Lord Mackay proposed:
   _ Adopting a contingency fee system, with fees based on the
lawyer's costs, not on a percentage of the judgment as in the United
States.
   _ Creating a legal services ombudsman with broad powers to
investigate complaints and order compensation.
   _ Permitting multidisciplinary practices which might include
barristers, solicitors, accountants, surveyors and estate agents
(realtors).
   Fennell, who is a senior barrister, said the new proposals struck
``at the root of everyone's right to be represented in court by an
independent advocate, free of state control.''
   He predicted the bar would ``wither away'' with the development
of ``big battalion'' law firms that would lure away the most skilled
advocates.
   Ultimately, Fennell said, the government's involvement in
licensing would give it the power to silence lawyers who take up
unpopular causes.
   Gaskell, however, said the bar's continued existence would depend
strictly on quality of service. ``I don't believe for a moment that
the independent bar will wither and die,'' he said.
   Anticipating fears that contingency fees might lead to ballooning
caseloads and damage awards, Lord Mackay noted that damages in
English courts are set by judges, not juries.
   He also proposed retaining a rule that requires losing plaintiffs
to pay defendants' legal costs.
   Desmond Wilson, chairman of the Citizen Action Compensation
Campaign, said the crucial question is whether the government is
committed to expanding legal aid: ``There are thousands of people
who are caught in the middle-income trap, deemed to be too affluent
to qualify for legal aid but who are not rich enough to even
contemplate taking legal proceedings.''

   The dollar closed slightly lower against the
Japanese yen Thursday, while share prices lost ground on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 127.37 yen, down 0.28 yen from Wednesday's
close of 127.65 yen, and traded in a tight range of 127.33 -.60
before closing at 127.52 yen, down 0.13 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 10.11 points for a record 31,567.79
points Wednesday, dipped 55.98 points, or 0.18 percent, to close at
31,511.81 points.
   Exchange dealers said the dollar's bearishness in Tokyo reflected
an overnight decline in New York amid intervention by the Federal
Reserve.
   One dealer said anxiety about possible intervention by the Bank
of Japan to push the dollar down was also reflected in the
currency's weakness. Trading otherwise was relatively quiet, he said.
   On the stock exchange, the market's main economic barometer edged
down as a result of profit taking.
   ``Many investors sat out today from the fear of higher interest
rates,'' said a dealer at Nikko Securities Co.

<TEXT>
   After a two-term presidency during which he
blasted kiss-and-tell books by aides, Ronald Reagan will get a
chance to do his own talking with a book deal that is expected to
bring millions.
   Reagan has signed a contract with Simon &amp; Schuster to write his
memoirs, the publishing house said Wednesday.
   ``I've got my pen in hand and I'm ready to get started,'' Reagan
said in a statement released by the publisher.
   The financial arrangements would not be disclosed, Reagan
spokesman Mark Weinberg said.
   Before the announcement, literary agent Irving ``Swifty'' Lazar,
a longtime Reagan friend, said every major publisher was bidding for
the Reagan book. He added, ``It will probably will bring $5 million
to $7 million.''
   Norman Brokaw, a literary agent who has handled book deals for
Reagan administration figures Alexander Haig, Caspar Weinberger,
Donald Regan and Larry Speakes, agreed.
   ``In the current market with the success of Ronald Reagan's
presidency, the books should be worth in excess of $5 million,'' he
said.
   In his statement, Reagan said he was ``anxious to begin work on
this book and to share insights with the American people.
   ``I have been fortunate in my public career to have been allowed
the opportunity to serve the people and through this book I will let
them know how the `American miracle' came about,'' Reagan said.
``This will be an honest and straightforward look at where we have
been, with some thoughts on where we're going.''
   Reagan will ``write the book himself, as far as I know,'' without
a co-author or ghostwriter, said Julia Knickerbocker, a Simon &amp;
Schuster spokeswoman.
   Ms. Knickerbocker said Simon &amp; Schuster also would issue a
collection of Reagan's speeches, with introductions written by
Reagan about the context and effect on public policy and opinion.
   That book is to appear within a year. No date was set for the
memoirs, which will contain ``his personal reminiscences,
reflections on his life and his achievements and on the key events,
successes and disappointments,'' the publisher said.
   The books will be edited by Michael Korda, editor-in-chief of
Simon &amp; Schuster. Richard Snyder, chairman of Simon &amp; Schuster, said
the memoirs ``will become one of the most valuable historical
documents of this century.''
   The former president's agent in the deal, attorney Morton L.
Janklow, said negotiations on Reagan's contract proceeded without
the president's knowledge while he was in office to avoid the
possibility of a conflict of interest.
   ``He didn't even know about this until Saturday,'' Janklow said.
   ``I think this will be more philosophical and more anecdotal than
many presidential memoirs have been,'' Janklow said. ``I don't think
he plans to rewrite the definitive history of the Reagan
administration. He's going to talk about the philosophical ideas he
represented and their impact on the American people.''
   Janklow also said Reagan plans to write the book himself, but
``he may have an editorial assistant.''

   The Republican, state Rep. Robert Kraus of Kingston, said he's
received mail from constituents miffed by political stands taken by
the Democrat, state Sen. Richard Kraus of Arlington. Arlington, a
suburb of Boston, is about 40 miles northwest of Kingston.
   Robert Kraus wrote a letter to the editor of The Patriot Ledger
in Quincy to explain who he is _ and to assure them that he's not
the Kraus who's working on a proposal to replace local property
taxes with income taxes.
   ``Let there be no mistake _ Sen. Richard Kraus and Rep. Robert
Kraus are not related by blood or by agreement on this matter,''
Robert Kraus wrote.
   Richard Kraus said he expected trouble after the election.
   ``I knew when a Robert Kraus appeared on the scene there was

   Vicksburg's leaders know a bargain when
they see one, and they aren't afraid to do things a little
differently.
   So it was that Mayor Robert Walker and two city aldermen managed
to grab a new police precinct station for just $1 this week before
it rolled out of town.
   The station is a caboose.
   The officials bought it from the Mid-South Rail Corp. and plan to
use it to increase the police presence in a southern section of the
historic river city.
   ``It will be a little different, but I think it will complement
other things in the area,'' Walker said.
   Police Chief Lamar Davidson said one person, a
receptionist-dispatcher, will occupy the caboose full time and
patrol officers will use it as a base.

   Head librarians at Mount Holyoke
College tend to have long tenures, but Anne Edmonds is retiring
after only a quarter century on the job, a little short of the
average.
   Edmonds, 64, is only the fourth head librarian at the women's
college since Mary Olivia Nutting took the job 119 years ago. She
said she plans to retire when the library's addition is complete, in
about two years.
   The average tenure of Edmond's three predecessors was 31.3 years.
   Nutting, who kept the job for 31 years, was followed by Bertha E.
Blakely, who served 35 years. Even after her retirement, Blakely
came in every day for 25 years to build the college's extensive
archives, Edmonds said.
   Next came Flora Belle Ludington, who held the post 28 years
before Edmonds took over in 1964.
   Edmonds attributed the long terms of her predecessors to the fact
that library administration was a man's field until recently and was
hard for a woman to move around in. That trend has since reversed.

   President Bush's embattled nominee as health
secretary won support from a cadre of conservative anti-abortion
senators after telling them he backs the president's position to
reverse the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.
   Louis W. Sullivan's meeting Wednesday with the conservative
senators followed reports by others on Capitol Hill that he had
voiced support for the 1973 Roe. Vs. Wade decision.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said Sullivan convinced him
otherwise. Humphrey said that ``on the basis of this meeting'' he
had no reservations about Sullivan to head the Department of Health
and Human Services.
   Sullivan also received a renewed vote of support from the
president.
   ``He has supported my position 100 percent,'' Bush said Wednesday
in an interview with newspaper reporters, adding the chances were
``none'' that he would withdraw the nomination.
   ``I've not heard anyone suggesting that he will not be
confirmed,'' Bush said.
   The dispute underscored the dilemma of Senate Republicans who do
not want anyone at HHS with views other than their own on the
abortion issue but who hesitate to oppose confirmation of Bush's
only black Cabinet nominee.
   ``It would be an embarrassment to the president, an embarrassment
to the Republican Party, if the nomination encountered any trouble
and we don't want that,'' Humphrey had said on Tuesday.
   In a bid to placate the anti-abortionists, White House chief of
staff John Sununu said Wednesday that Sullivan had suggested
Constance Horner, a former Regan administration personnel director
whose anti-abortion views are well known, as his chief deputy at HHS.
   Humphrey said he was satisfied that the new secretary be
surrounded by aides ``who would actively support the president on
abortion.''
   The issue of Sullivan's abortion views resurfaced earlier this
week after Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, a pro-choice Republican,
said that in a recent meeting Sullivan had expressed his personal
support for Roe vs. Wade.
   As recently as Monday, when thousands of anti-abortion protestors
marched to mark the 16th anniversary of the high court's decision,
Bush reaffirmed his opposition to abortion and called for the
decision's reversal.
   Sullivan himself has said little publicly.
   ``Once the hearings go forward, everything will be cleared,'' he
said Wednesday after meeting with senators including abortion
opponents Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, James
McClure of Idaho and William Armstrong of Colorado.
   Also attending was a conservative who has taken a pro-choice
position for many years _ Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo. _ who agreed
with the others that Sullivan had expressed opposition to Roe vs.
Wade.
   He said the nominee ``not only feels that as a designee of George
Bush but as a person.''
   Simpson said Sullivan would spell out his position in a written
statement that would be made public.
   ``He never quite knew what was waiting for him here,'' said
Simpson. ``He was trying to, maybe like a doctor would, explain his
diagnosis.''

   Atlanta police recruiters are beating the
bushes in the Deep South, offering pay hikes of up to $8,000 just to
keep officers on the streets of one of the nation's fastest growing
cities.
   The department has tried to hire 200 officers for each of the
last two years. Last year, it was able to come up with only 119
candidates and the recruiters are blaming competition with
neighboring counties, which are growing along with Atlanta.
   ``You've got to realize we've got 17 counties to compete
against,'' recruiter R.E. Gordon said during a week-long stop here.
``A lot of the growth is in the suburbs and they need employees,
too.''
   A new precinct planned to open this year and an annual attrition
rate of about 140 officers has the Atlanta police department
scrambling to find recruits. Last February, five recruiters from the
1,400-officer department began making out-of-state trips to find new
officers.
   ``We pick our destination cities based on population, schools and
the economy. There's no sense going to Coral Gables, Florida, where
they pay officers $35,000 a year and we're offering $22,000,''
recruiter M.H. Gray said. ``A lot of people in cities like Jackson
start at minimum wage or $4.50 and it's hard to make a living or
have anything.''
   The Jackson police department pays just over $14,000 a year to
first-year police officers, who must have at least two years of
college, compared with $21,392 for first-year Atlanta officers, who
do not need a degree. Officers with two years of college receive
$22,237 to start in Atlanta, recruiters said.
   The recruiters said they do not actively seek out local police
officers, but will test any applicant interested.
   Gordon said the majority of Atlanta recruits do not come from
police departments in the cities they visit.
   Last year, recruiters visited 19 cities, including Fayetteville,
N.C., Columbia, S.C., Louisville, Ky. and Nashville, Tenn., Gordon
said. Nine trips are planned this year, the recruiters said.
   Gordon said 141 people had picked up applications by Wednesday
morning. About 75 were expected to be tested today with 30
eventually hired from Jackson, Gordon said.
   One applicant said Wednesday he has been trying to find a job
with various law enforcement agencies in Mississippi for the past
eight months.
   ``Mississippi just doesn't have the funds available,'' said Kevin
Iosty, 21, an electrician who traveled about 85 miles from Laurel to
apply. ``This is a career I've been wanting to pursue for a long
time and Mississippi just doesn't have the opportunities.''

<HEAD>CDs Overtake LPs for First Time, Industry Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time since they hit record
stores, compact discs outsold vinyl long-playing records the first
six months of last year, joining the cassette in threatening to
render the LP obsolete.
   Manufacturer shipments of CDs soared 64 percent, to 70.4 million
units, in the first six months of 1988, up from 43 million units in
the first half of 1987, the Recording Industry Association of
America said Wednesday.
   LP deliveries, on the other hand, declined 22.4 percent to 43.5
million units from the 56 million shipped in 1987's first six
months, the association said.
   Music lovers spent $1 billion for CDs, which are more expensive
than LPs, in the first six months of 1988, a nearly 50 percent gain
in dollar sales over the same period in 1987.
   When CDs were introduced in 1983, they accounted for just $17.2
million in sales, the RIAA said.
   The figures, which take into account unsold LPs and CDs returned
to manufacturers, show that cassette shipments improved 11 percent
to 208.1 million units in the January to June period last year,
compared with 188 million in the first half of 1987.
   For all of 1987, CD deliveries rose a whopping 93 percent over
1986 to 102.1 million units, and cassettes improved 19 percent to
410 million units. LPs, meanwhile, declined 15 percent to 107
million units in 1987.
   The demise of the vinyl LP has been predicted for some time. But
Patricia Heimers, an RIAA spokeswomen, said it was premature to say
the long-play album was going the way of the 78 rpm record and
eight-track cassettes.
   ``I think that the LP will be around for a good long while,'' she
said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``We've seen over the past
few years a shifting in the configuration of choice.''
   ``There are an awful lot of LP lovers out there. ... Each
configuration serves different needs for different consumers,''
Heimers said.

<HEAD>Alfonsin Gives Military Voice In Internal Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Raul Alfonsin has
created a national security council that includes the three military
chiefs of staff, giving the rightist armed forces a voice in
Argentine internal security.
   The action late Wednesday came in response to a guerrilla assault
on a suburban army base that left 36 people dead, most of them
leftist extremists, authorities said. In his decree, Alfonsin said
he formed the council to advise him on ``anti-subversive action.''
   In addition to the army, air force and navy chiefs, it includes
the defense, interior and foreign relations ministers, the state
intelligence chief, a secretary to be designated by the president
and Alfonsin.
   The president may add other members to the council at his
discretion.
   The rightist military has long pressed for a role in determining
internal security policy, but Alfonsin had refused under pressure
from human rights groups and the political left, which fears a
resurgence of anti-leftist repression.
   The government says at least 8,900 suspected subversives vanished
without a trace in the 1970s during the military's ``dirty war''
campaign to rid the country of leftists. Human rights groups say up
to 30,000 people actually were abducted and are presumed to have
been killed by security forces.
   Since Alfonsin was elected president 5{ years ago, military
tensions have been on the rise, especially since April 1987.
   Alfonsin has faced three uprisings in the last 21 months by
right-wing elements in the army infuriated by the human rights
trials of military officials accused of atrocities during the armed
forces' 1976-83 rule.
   The decree said Monday's attack on the 3rd Infantry Regiment's
base, the first leftist guerrilla action in more than a decade, made
necessary ``the taking of decisions conducive to efficiently
preventing, controlling and stifling a repetition of these events.''
   A heavily armed group assaulted the infantry base in suburban La
Tablada and it was retaken after a 27-hour siege by army and police
forces backed by tanks, helicopter gunships and artillery.
   Seven soldiers, one policeman and 28 guerrillas were killed.
Another 68 people were wounded, and 19 guerrillas were captured,
authorities said.
   Also Wednesday, Attorney General Andres D'Alessio said
investigations revealed the dead included Jorge Caldu, a member of
the defunct People's Revolutionary Army, known by its Spanish
initials ERP.
   The ERP, a Marxist guerrilla group active in the 1970s, was
virtually wiped out in a harsh anti-subversion campaign after the
military seized power in 1976.
   Another victim was Manuel Banos, a leader of the Movement
Everyone for the Country, a small leftist organization known to
include former ERP militants. Another leader of the movement, Juan
Burgos, was among those captured.
   The guerrillas were believed to be seeking to attract popular
support by staging a raid on the regiment, thus showing their
militant opposition to right-wing elements in the armed forces.
   The group called itself the Popular Resistance Front.

<HEAD>Mitchell Agenda Democratic at Home, Bipartisan Abroad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. George Mitchell used his inaugural address
as Senate majority leader to offer President Bush ``true
bipartisanship'' on foreign policy while pushing a distinctly
Democratic agenda on domestic issues.
   The Maine Democrat's proposals include boosting the minimum wage,
improving the lot of the homeless, assuring day care for the
children of workers and investing in education, housing and
improving the environment.
   Mitchell said that while Bush recognized many of these needs in
his presidential inaugural address last Friday, ``he has yet to tell
us how he proposes to meet them.''
   On the Senate's first working day of the 101st Congress,
Mitchell, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas and other
senators jammed the legislative hopper with some 300 bills, some
retreads from the past, some representing new initiatives.
   The Senate also unanimously confirmed the first of President
Bush's Cabinet choices, all by identical 99-0 roll call votes. Only
Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., was not present to vote.
   The first three confirmed members of the Bush Cabinet are
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth
Hanford Dole and budget director Richard Darman.
   Mitchell presented a Democratic view of the nation's problems in
a carefully tailored response to Bush's inaugural address, strongly
endorsing its appeal to end bickering and restore bipartisanship in
foreign policy.
   ``In his inaugural address the president put his hand out to me
and to the speaker of the House,'' Mitchell said. ``I now extend
mine to him.''
   ``We are here to make a new start,'' Mitchell said. ``A central
aim of that new start for me is to pledge to President Bush that I
will do my utmost to foster true bipartisanship.''
   But promises and good intentions will not make bipartisanship a
fact, Mitchell said.
   ``It requires deeds to match words, action to carry out
intention,'' he said. ``Bipartisanship grows from shared
responsibility.''
   Mitchell added, however, that serious consultation between the
White House and Capitol Hill ``will not prevent differences between
the Congress and the president.''
   ``There have always been such differences,'' he said. ``There
always will be.''
   He made clear that for the two parties to come together in a
cooperative foreign policy, ways must be found to end the festering
feud over the War Powers Act. The act is intended to compel a
president to withdraw U.S. forces from potentially hostile
situations if Congress objects to their presence.
   Congressional supporters of the act defend it as protecting the
constitutional right of Congress to declare war. But former
President Reagan and other chief executives have called for its
repeal as an unconstitutional encroachment on a president's power as
commander in chief of the armed forces.
   ``I believe a constitutionally sound compromise is possible and I
shall work for it,'' Mitchell said.
   Dole also pledged bipartisanship. But at the same time he said it
is the aim of Senate Republicans to ``support and further the cause
of our new Republican president.''
   The confirmation process got into full gear with the Senate votes
confirming Baker, Darman and Mrs. Dole and the opening of
confirmation hearings for Defense Secretary-designate John Tower and
several other Cabinet nominees.
   One nominee apparently defused controversy over his views.
   Louis Sullivan, named by President Bush's to head the Department
of Health and Human Services, met privately with anti-abortion
senators and apparently convinced them his views are close enough to
theirs to merit their support.
   ``Dr. Sullivan believes in his heart that the Roe vs. Wade
decision should be overturned,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
referring to the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.
Sullivan, head of the Morehouse College medical school, had upset
many conservative legislators when he was quoted by a senator as
saying he did not favor overturning the ruling.
   The speeches by Dole and Mitchell were followed by a rush to
introduce the first legislation of the year.
   The hundreds of bills ranged from a measure to block or repeal
the proposed $45,000 pay raise for lawmakers to Dole's proposal for
a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.
   The very first bill _ S.1, the Integrity In Post Employment Act _
would restrict members of Congress and congressional staff as well
as members of the executive branch from lobbying for specified
periods after leaving government service.
   Mitchell told reporters he favors a pay raise as part of the
ethics package, as long as senators no longer are permitted to
accept fees for giving speeches and making personal appearances.
   The proposed pay raise has become the most controversial issue of
the new Congress.
   The goal of opponents is to block attempts by House Speaker Jim
Wright to permit the pay raise to take effect automatically in two
weeks by preventing a vote to forbid it.
   Lawmakers' salaries are scheduled to rise on Feb. 8 from just
over $89,500 to $135,000, an increase of 50 percent. Federal judges
and some political appointees would also see their salaries boosted.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors executive Donald J. Moore was
named second in command at the Pentagon, and former Rep. W. Henson
Moore of Louisiana was tapped for the No. 2 spot at the Energy
Department, as President Bush filled vacancies in his administration.
   Bush on Wednesday also filled the No. 2 position in the Office of
Management and Budget, naming attorney William M. Diefenderfer III.
   Atwood, Moore and Diefenderfer all must be confirmed by the
Senate.
   Atwood, who is expected to bring management expertise to the
Pentagon, has been vice chairman of the board of General Motors
since 1987. He will work under former Sen. John Tower of Texas, who
is Bush's nominee as secretary of defense.
   Moore, who served in the House from Louisiana from 1975 until
1987 and is considered knowledgeable about the oil and gas industry,
had been under consideration for the top job at the Energy
Department.
   However, Bush decided to name an energy secretary who was an
expert in nuclear energy, and chose former chief of naval operations
James D. Watkins for the post.
   Since leaving Congress, Moore has been a partner in a law firm
based in Atlanta and Washington.
   Diefenderfer served as chief of staff and counsel to Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., when he was chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
   Filling out other senior positions at the budget office, Bush
named Robert E. Grady, a campaign adviser and speechwriter, as
associate director for natural resources, energy and science; Janet
Hale, who was an assistant secretary in the Transportation
Department, to be associate director for economics and government;
Edwin L. Dale Jr., a former newspaper reporter who worked at the
budget office and Commerce Department for the last eight years, as
counselor and director of external affairs; and Thomas A. Scully, an
attorney, to be associate director for congressional affairs.
   Also Paul D. Wolfowitz, the U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, is
expected to be named undersecretary of defense for policy. The job
has been vacant since Fred C. Ikle resigned a year ago.
   Wolfowitz was assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs
for more than three years before his appointment to the Jakarta post.
   Bush also announced he was nominating Fred Zeder II to be
president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, succeeding
Craig Nalen.
   Zeder had been a senior adviser to the Bush transition team. He
also played a prominent role in Bush's presidential campaign. Zeder
previously had served as President Ronald Reagan's special
representative on negotiations with on the status of Micronesia.
   Another appointment announced was the nomination of Susan
Engeleiter to be administrator of the Small Business Administration,
succeeding James Abdnor.
   Mrs. Engeleiter served as state Senate minority leader in the
Wisconsin legislature since 1984, but lost a bid for the U.S. Senate
to Democrat Herbert Kohl, owner of the Milwaukee Bucks of the
National Basketball Association.
   Bush also nominated Paul D. Coverdell, formerly a member of the
Georgia Legislature, to become Peace Corps director succeeding Loret
M. Ruppe.
   Coverdell now is president and chief executive officer of
Coverdell &amp; Co., Inc., in Atlanta and was formerly chairman of the
Republican Party in Georgia.
   Bruce S. Gelb, vice chairman of the board of Bristol-Myers
Company, will be nominated as director of the United States
Information Agency, succeeding Charles Z. Wick, the president
announced.
   Bush also said he would nominate Constance Berry Newman, who
worked in his campaign, as director of the Office of Personnel
Management.

<HEAD>Fire, Poisonous Fumes Impede Rescue Efforts In Peruvian Gold Mine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire and poisonous fumes in a collapsed
Peruvian gold mine slowed efforts by rescuers to find amateur miners
trapped hundreds of feet underground for more than five days,
officials said.
   Energy Minister Jose Carrasco said ``authorities have almost no
hope of finding more survivors'' in the Sol de Oro gold mine, 230
miles south of Lima near Nazca.
   Three miners have been rescued, and six found dead in the mine,
which was being worked on a part-time basis by area residents after
it had been abandoned last year by its owners, official sources said.
   Nazca police Lt. Juan Robles said the trapped miners have been
inside the mine since Saturday, when a fire prevented their escape.
   The mine caved in Monday after the blaze, which was set during a
dispute by rival mining factions, collapsed wooden tunnel supports,
officials said.
   Carrasco said the dispute was over a newly discovered vein that
was yielding 4.5 pounds of gold daily. He said the exact number of
trapped miners was not known.
   Official sources have given conflicting figures of 15 to 200
miners.
   Police said toxic gas and smoke from a smoldering fire were the
greatest impediments to rescuers, six of whom were hospitalized for
inhalation of the poisoned air.
   Hopes were buoyed for finding survivors Tuesday when Carrasco
reported rescuers heard faint tapping from caved-in tunnels. But
those hopes dimmed Wednesday.
   ``There cannot be any life inside the mine because they have been
trapped for five days counting today,'' Juan Taipe, a Nazca
councilman who heads the city rescue effort, said Wednesday.
   The fire started in the five-level mine after gas lamps used for
lighting set ablaze wooden tunnel supports on the second.
   Officials said miners were believed located on the second, third
and fourth levels of the mine, which extends about 1,000 feet into a
half-mile high hill on Nazca's outskirts.

   On a warm spring night in 1974, Ted Bundy waited
for his next victim in an alley behind a row of sorority and
fraternity houses, clutching a briefcase and with crutches tucked
under his arms.
   University of Washington's Greek Row was his stage, and his props
were in place. The crutches to signify a disabled leg. The briefcase
that was hard to carry. A few blocks away, his brown Volkswagen bug
waited in a parking lot. Behind its rear wheels were handcuffs and a
crowbar.
   Bundy, who could be a poised and charming man, was all
anticipation as 18-year-old Georgann Hawkins happened along. She was
just completing her first college year that June 11, and was headed
down the well-lit alley for her sorority house.
   ``I was moving up the alley, using a briefcase and some crutches,
and the young woman walked down,'' Bundy said on the tape played
Wednesday by Robert Keppel, a state attorney general's investigator.
   The tape was made Friday, the day Bundy confessed to the eight
1974 ``Ted'' killings in western Washington. Bundy, 42, was executed
Tuesday morning in Florida for the 1978 rape and murder of a
12-year-old girl.
   Five ``Ted'' victims had been slain by the time Bundy encountered
Ms. Hawkins.
   On the tape, Bundy said Ms. Hawkins paused for a moment, then
``kept on walking down the alley toward me.''
   At mid-block the two came together and the handsome Bundy must
have known what to say. ``I ... asked her to help me carry the
briefcase. Which she did and we walked back up the alley'' toward
his car, he said in a matter-of-fact manner, whispering in spots.
   ``When we reached the car ... I knocked her unconscious with the
crowbar. ... There were some handcuffs there, along with the
crowbar. ... I handcuffed her and put her in the passenger's side of
the car and drove away.
   ``She was unconscious but she was very much alive.''
   Bundy said he drove to Issaquah, 15 miles east of Seattle.
   In the tape, filled with pauses and sighs, Bundy quickly
summarized the rest of the trip: ``past Issaquah and up the hill,
down the road to a grassy area.
   ``I ... took her out of the (car) and took the handcuffs off her
and ...''
   The easy-talking Bundy, who Keppel said had a habit of talking
fast when he was slipping away from the truth, had a hard time
getting the words out on what then happened to Ms. Hawkins.
   ``Gee, this is probably the hardest part, I don't know. (Pause).
I don't know, it's all getting sort of abs..., um, not abstract
would be poor, but um, well we're getting into some, we're getting
right down to it and uh well we'll talk about it, it's just you
know, you understand, it's not something that I find easy to talk
about and after all this time. (Pause, deep sigh).''
   At this point in the news conference, Keppel stopped the tape,
out of respect, he said, for the victim's family.
   ``It's bad. That's about all I can say,'' he said of Bundy's
continuing description of Ms. Hawkins' murder.
   Keppel has offered to describe to the families of victims the
treatment to which they were subjected. So far, he said, he has had
no takers.
   Keppel said Bundy did say later in the tape, intertwined with
``gruesome details,'' that he had returned to near the University of
Washington the day after Ms. Hawkins' abduction to recover her shoe
and shattered earrings.
   He rode over on his bicycle and found them near where he had
parked his Volkswagen, even while police were inspecting the alley a
few blocks away.

<TEXT>
   The Honduran military vowed
retribution for the assassination of former armed forces chief Gen.
Gustavo Adolfo Alvarez Martinez, the father of the Nicaraguan Contra
rebel movement.
   Officials said Alvarez, the founder of the U.S.-backed
anti-Sandinista movement in Honduras, was slain Wednesday when six
gunmen riddled the car he was sitting in outside his home in the
capital's Florencia district.
   The armed forces said Wednesday that Alvarez, 56, had been
``vilely assassinated'' and it ``deeply mourned the tragic death.''
   In a news release, it ``energetically condemned the extremist
forces that try to fill our country with blood and terror'' and
promised to ``act according to the law against those who violate the
norms of the law and human dignity, trying to upset tranquility and
the democratic stability of our nation.''
   Radio America, a local station, said anonymous callers claimed
responsibility on behalf of the Popular Liberation Forces, a leftist
extremist group. Police said they had no evidence to confirm the
claim.
   It was the third assassination in Honduras in three weeks.
Previously killed were a Nicaraguan rebel commander and a reputed
druglord's lawyer.
   As head of the national police in 1981, Alvarez became the
godfather of the Contra rebels by telling the late CIA director
William Casey forces opposed to Nicaragua's ruling leftist
Sandinistas could operate from Honduran territory.
   Police said the driver of the former military chief's car also
was killed in Wednesday morning's shooting and Alvarez's son-in-law
was wounded.
   Alvarez was chief of the armed forces from 1982 to 1984 under
President Roberto Suazo Cordova and frequently denounced the
Sandinistas.
   Trained in the United States and Argentina, he was once
considered the most powerful figure in Honduras.
   Alvarez also presided over the beginning of joint U.S.-Honduran
military exercises in Honduras that were designed to intimidate the
rulers of neighboring Nicaragua.
   The Contras, Alvarez once pledged, would ``wage a war without
quarter against international communism, which has now taken over
Nicaragua.''
   Under his original proposal to Casey, described in the book
``Banana Diplomacy'' by journalist Roy Gutman, Alvarez proposed
using the rebels to provoke a border incident with the Sandinistas
in Nicaragua. Honduras then would ask the United States for
assistance, permitting U.S. intervention.
   Alvarez also supervised a counterinsurgency campaign against
suspected Honduran guerrillas that U.S. officials privately viewed
as a success.
   Human rights activists charged that the campaign relied on
military-linked death squads and at least 100 people disappeared or
were jailed illegally. Honduran forces deny the charges.
   Honduran officials have kept a low profile on the Contras and
officially denied their presence on Honduran territory, even when
thousands operated from border camps.
   Alvarez's denunciations of the Sandinistas brought embarrassing
attention to the U.S. role in Honduras and Honduran support for the
Contras.
   In a 1982 interview, he denied he took orders from John Dimitri
Negroponte, the former U.S. ambassador to Honduras: ``No gringo
gives us orders _ no foreigner. We are not going to be a vassal or a
puppet of the United States.,'' Military officers led by then-Gen.
Walter Lopez Reyes ousted Alvarez in 1984, and he sought exile in
Miami after receiving a dishonorable discharge.
   U.S. officials said in 1984 that Suazo Cordova ousted Alvarez
because he meddled in politics. Most Honduran political and military
sources said the Honduran military command orchestrated the ouster
because he did not consult them on vital decisions.
   About 12,000 Contra fighters now are believed to be in Honduran
border camps. U.S. military aid to the Contras ended 11 months ago
and they now receive only humanitarian aid.
   In another assassination this month, veteran Contra military
commander Manuel Adan Rugama Acevedo was fatally shot just outside
the capital on Jan. 7. On Monday, two gunmen killed Carlos Diaz
Lorenzana, a lawyer for reputed drug baron Juan Ramon Matta, who was
spirited out of the country last year to the United States. Matta's
extradition prompted nationalist riots.

<HEAD>Harvard Professor To Teach Soviet Diplomats</HEAD>

   Soviet diplomats will soon get
negotiating tips from a Harvard professor in an unprecedented
workshop focusing on clearer communications between the superpowers.
   ``I don't want to dance a minuet if they're doing the polka,''
said the professor, Roger Fisher. ``It's not that there's one right
way to negotiate, but we can learn from each other.''
   The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday formally
agreed to hold the five-day workshop at its Diplomatic Academy in
Moscow in late March.
   ``It's the first time in Soviet history that we have invited
American scholars to come over to Russia and lecture students at a
diplomatic academy,'' said Victor Issraelyan, a ministry official
who holds ambassadorial rank.
   ``I think in our time, in the new nuclear age, negotiations are
becoming more and more important,'' Issraelyan said. ``There is no
alternative.''
   The workshop, which Harvard proposed last fall, will be conducted
by Fisher, a law professor with Harvard's Negotiation Project, and
Soviet experts.
   About two dozen Soviet diplomats will participate, Fisher said.
   He said the differences between the United States and Soviet
Union are key reasons for making sure both sides are negotiating
within the same framework.
   The workshop isn't intended to teach Soviets an American style of
negotiating or to minimize differences between the two countries,
Fisher said.
   ``There are real differences of perception,'' he said. ``Instead
of arguing who's right, we want to be working out the best way of
dealing with things.''
   Fisher, co-author of ``Getting Together: Building a Relationship
that Gets to Yes,'' said the problem with traditional negotiations
is that both sides start from firm positions, meaning any change
involves concessions. He said better negotiations begin with both
sides discussing general guidelines rather than specific commitments.
   For example, instead of discussing the rights and wrongs of the
Strategic Defense Initiative, or ``Star Wars,'' negotiating teams
could accept that research is inevitable while deployment is not
immediately likely and could work out guidelines for research,
Fisher said.
   ``I think for years negotiators have often seen themselves as
soldiers in a cause, doing battle on behalf of their country,'' he
said. ``Our perception is that diplomats should rather see
themselves as a cadre of professionals skilled at dealing with the
genuine differences between their governments.''
   The U.S. State Department is aware of the workshop but not
directly involved, Fisher said.
   He said the Negotiation Project is exploring the possibility of
conducting a similar workshop in Washington.

<HEAD>Economist Says Soviet Deficit Three Times Higher Than October Projection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's budget deficit is three times
what the Kremlin projected three months ago and must be quickly
lowered if chronic shortages of consumer goods are to end, a senior
economist says.
   Leonid Abalkin, director of the Economics Institute of the
Academy of Sciences, told a news conference Wednesday that the
deficit ``ruins the national economy.''
   He said the $162 billion budget shortfall could be eliminated in
two to three years if the state stops funding more money-losing
enterprises and the military devotes more of its resources to the
civilian sector.
   ``Without a solution to this problem, we won't be able to solve
the problem of consumer goods shortages,'' Abalkin said.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called improving supplies of
food and consumer goods for the country's 285 million people a top
priority in his program of perestroika, or restructuring the economy.
   In October, Soviet officials said the budget had been running in
the red for years and projected a deficit of $55 billion on a budget
of $795 billion.
   This month, economist O.T. Bogomolov wrote that the deficit
actually could reach $162 billion this year, and Abalkin agreed with
that estimate.
   He said the April 1986 explosion and fire at the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant and earthquakes in Armenia last month and in
Tadzhikistan this month had contributed to the deficit.
   He said world economic conditions, such as the falling price of
oil _ the Soviet Union's main export _ were also to blame.
   The Soviet Union itself could be criticized because its ``unwise
export structure'' is ``very vulnerable'' to fluctuations in the
price of oil, Abalkin said.
   He said some production targets in the Five-Year Plan that runs
through 1990 should be scrapped, and $32 billion could be saved by
closing bad businesses and calling off expensive construction
projects and other huge outlays.
   The state should stop financing businesses that won't turn a
profit for years and instead focus on enterprises that can make
quick profits, he said. The government reported last week that one
in 10 enterprises lost money in 1988.
   Other help could come from the military. Instead of building new
factories, plants producing goods for the military could turn their
ready-made resources and skilled workforce to civilian use, he said.
   Gorbachev said this month that the military budget will be
trimmed by 14.2 percent and the production of arms and military
supplies by 19.5 percent.
   The state traditionally has all but ignored the market forces of
supply and demand, wasting money on unprofitable factories that
produce goods no one wants and giving short shrift to some highly
sought items. It also set prices artificially low on basics such as
housing, meat, bread and cabbage.
   Last year, the Soviet Union began an effort to change that by
ordering businesses that cannot pay their own way to close. But
Abalkin said no businesses have gone bankrupt.
   In some cases, when closing was imminent, workers formed a
private business to run the operation as a cooperative, he said.

<HEAD>China Announces Visit by Soviet Foreign Minister</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China announced today that Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze will visit Beijing next week, setting the stage
for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said Shevardnadze will be
in Beijing for three days beginning Feb. 2, renewing talks with his
Chinese counterpart on normalizing relations marred by three decades
of hostility and mistrust.
   Qian Qichen held talks with Kremlin leaders in Moscow in
December, the first Chinese foreign minister to do so in 32 years.
   If next month's talks go well, the two foreign ministers may set
a date for the first Sino-Soviet summit since Nikita Khrushschev met
Mao Tse-tung in Beijing in 1959.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has repeatedly expressed
his eagerness to improve ties with China and is widely expected to
travel to Beijing in April or May.
   Gorbachev's meeting with 84-year-old senior Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping would formally normalize ties strained since the two
countries split over ideological differences in 1960 and fought a
short border war in 1969.
   Li said Shevardnadze and Qian will ``prepare for a summit meeting
between top leaders of China and the Soviet Union. The two sides
will also exchange opinions on other matters of common interest.
Chinese leaders will meet with Shevardnadze.''
   He said the Qian-Shevardnadze talks will take up what China says
is the main obstacle to better Sino-Soviet ties _ the conflict in
Cambodia.
   China backs the anti-Vietnamese resistance in Cambodia; the
Soviet Union backs Vietnam's 10-year occupation of the war-torn
country.
   Both powers agree that a withdrawal of Vietnamese troops is the
key to a political settlement.
   However, differences remain on the composition of a coalition
government to be formed by the Hanoi-backed forces in Phnom Penh,
the Cambodian capital, and the three-party resistance including the
Khmer Rouge.
   China has welcomed a recent Vietnamese proposal to remove all its
troops in Cambodia by September and says it will reduce military aid
to the resistance in conjunction with the pullout.
   Marked progress also has been made in resolving the other two
issues China sees as obstacles to normal relations with Moscow _
Afghanistan and border tensions.
   Soviet troops are reportedly leaving Afghanistan in the final
stage of a military pullout to be completed by Feb. 15. Gorbachev
also announced last week that Soviet troop strength in Asia will be
reduced by 200,000.
   Most Soviet troops in Asia are located near the Sino-Chinese
border or in Soviet ally Mongolia, and are regarded by China as a
direct threat to its security.
   Normalization of political ties will not bring dramatic changes
to overall ties, which have been steadily improving during the 1980s.
   Trade between the powers in 1988 has been estimated at about $2.8
billion, up 30 percent from the previous year, and barter along the
highly militarized 5,000-mile border is booming.
   Cultural and academic exchanges are increasing. The official
Xinhua News Agency said today that 600 Chinese scholars will go to
the Soviet Union this year and 320 Soviets will study at Chinese
universities. In 1983, when academic contacts were renewed, only 10
scholars were exchanged.
   The two sides also are discussing joint ventures and Soviet
technological help to modernize factories set up by the Soviets in
the 1950s and then abandoned when relations deteriorated.
   China has emphasized it will never return to the political
relationship of the 1950s, when the fledgling Chinese Communist
state followed the Soviet lead in setting international policy.

<TEXT>
   Ted Bundy requested in his will that
his body be cremated and the ashes scattered over Washington state's
Cascade Mountains, where the remains of at least four of his victims
were found, a newspaper reported.
   The will signed the night before his execution also gives the
serial killer's civil attorney, Diana Weiner of Sarasota, control
over his remains, personal property and assets, including $709.66 in
cash, the Florida Times-Union reported today.
   Sandy Williams, co-owner of the Williams-Thomas Funeral Home in
Gainesville, where Bundy's body was sent following Tuesday's
execution at the Florida State Prison, said no public funeral was
planned.
   But Williams would not give details about the final disposition
of the body because of an agreement with Ms. Weiner.
   The will did not give a specific location for the scattering of
the ashes, and attempts by The Associated Press to reach Ms. Weiner
on Wednesday night were unsuccessful.
   Bundy, a 42-year-old former law school dropout, was executed
Tuesday for the February 1978 murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach
of Lake City. He also was convicted of two other Florida deaths. He
confessed to 23 other slayings in the days before his execution.
   Bob Keppel, a Washington state attorney general's investigator
who has tracked Bundy for 15 years, said Wednesday he thinks Bundy
could be responsible for more than 100 slayings dating back to 1969.
   Bundy admitted late last week he was responsible for eight
murders in 1974 in western Washington. The remains of four victims
were found on Taylor Mountain in the foothills of the Cascades.
   Prison records show Bundy's personal property included a radio
with a headphone, a gold-colored chain with a cross, a religious
book, stationery, a gold-colored wedding band, and a bottle of
suntan lotion.
   The $709.66 in cash was money donated by family and friends for
snacks and other items from the prison canteen.
   The items were inventoried Tuesday and picked up at the prison by
Ms. Weiner, said Department of Corrections spokesman Bob Macmaster.

<HEAD>Prince Cancels Meetings In Indonesia, Paris and Bangkok</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk today canceled a trip to Indonesia for peace talks because
the Vietnamese-backed government in his homeland has rejected his
peace proposal.
   Sihanouk, who leads a coalition fighting Vietnam's 10-year
occupation of Cambodia, said in a statement that ``it is absolutely
useless for me to be in Jakarta'' for next month's talks.
   The prince also said he would not go to Paris for a meeting of
the three resistance factions and the Vietnam-backed Phnom Penh
government next spring and called off a meeting in Bangkok with Thai
Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila at the end of February.
   Vietnam, Laos, the warring parties of Cambodia and the members of
the non-communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations were to
meet in Jakarta from Feb. 19 to 22 for the second session of
multilateral peace talks. The first meeting was held last July.
   The association includes Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore,
Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
   Sihanouk, who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday, said the recent
rejection of his five-point peace plan for Cambodia sparked his
decision.
   A day earlier, the mercurial leader said he would go to Jakarta,
but would not take part in the talks.
   In his plan, Sihanouk proposed that an international peacekeeping
force supervise Vietnam's withdrawal.
   Hun Sen, the Hanoi-backed prime minister of Cambodia, has
rejected the plan because he claims it would facilitate the return
to power in Cambodia of the Khmer Rouge, the most powerful of the
three resistance groups.
   The Khmer Rouge led Cambodia from 1975 to late 1978 and were
responsible for at least 1 million deaths during a bloody rule.
Vietnam's invasion in Dec. 1978 replaced the pro-Beijing Khmer Rouge
with a pro-Hanoi regime.
   China attacked Vietnam in 1979 to ``punish'' it for the Cambodian
invasion. But in a sign of progress on the Cambodian issue, the two
countries last week held their first high-level meeting in a decade.
   During the talks, Vietnam agreed in principle to withdraw its
troops from Cambodia by September, assuming a political solution can
be reached. Hanoi also agreed that an international group could
supervise the withdrawal, but its makeup has yet to be determined.
   China for its part agreed to slow its aid to the Cambodian
resistance coalition as Vietnam withdraws its troops.
   The agreement in principle does not represent a change in
position by either country. Both had issued public statements before
the meeting spelling out their positions.
   On Tuesday, Sihanouk said he opposed the linking of ``an end to
material aid to the resistance and the withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops.'' He also said he was pessimistic about an easy solution to
the conflict.
   Sihanouk said progress has been made on solving the international
aspects of the conflict, but a ``deadlock'' remains regarding the
makeup of a future Cambodian government.
   In Bangkok, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan today urged
all Cambodian guerrilla factions to attend the peace talks in
Indonesia.
   ``The Cambodian parties must face one another. It's pointless for
them to fight and kill one another,'' Chatichai told reporters after
two days of talks with Hun Sen.

   After a month of refurbishing by
shipworkers with Pilgrims' pride, the Mayflower II is ship-shape and
back in its berth.
   ``It came back yesterday and it looks absolutely gorgeous,''
Plimoth Plantation spokeswoman Troy Creane said Wednesday.
   The ship, visited by about 300,000 people a year, undergoes major
repairs about every two years, and minor maintenance is nearly
continuous.
   ``It's one of the prime attractions in Plymouth, and it's very
important to keep her in as good a shape as possible,'' Creane said.
   The repairs at the Gloucester Marine Railway cost about $25,000,
Plantation spokesman Jeff Scotland said. He said the ship was
repainted with nontoxic paint to help prevent water contamination.
   Built in England, the 106{-foot-long ship sailed to Plymouth in
1957 as a symbol of friendship to America.
   The original ship sailed to North America in 1620 with 102
passengers and was dismantled in 1622.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
has rejected leftist rebels' conditional proposal to participate in
national elections, calling it unconstitutional and a ``proposal for
war.''
   The guerrillas, who have been battling the U.S.-backed government
for nine years, offered to participate in this year's presidential
balloting if it were postponed from March 19 to September and other
conditions were met.
   The rebels have rejected as ``farce'' all five elections held
this decade, claiming they were part of a ``U.S.-imposed
counterinsurgency project.''
   The proposal, announced Tuesday by guerrilla leaders at a Mexico
City news conference, was virtually rejected that afternoon by Fidel
Chavez Mena, presidential candidate of Duarte's Christian Democratic
Party.
   The United States has not responded.
   ``This is not a proposal for peace. It is a proposal for war,''
Duarte told reporters on Wednesday. ``There are the threats. They're
talking about attacks, escalating the war'' if the proposal is not
accepted.
   He said that according to the constitution, presidential
elections must be held no later than two months before the end of
the 5-year presidential term.
   Duarte's term ends June 1.
   In its proposal, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
said it would accept the extension of Duarte's administration until
the new election date. Duarte, who is dying of liver cancer, said:
``I don't accept the idea of remaining in the presidency even one
minute after the end of my term.''
   The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, also
rejected the guerrilla proposal as unconstitutional. Arena candidate
Alfredo Cristiani is leading Chavez Mena in recent polls.
   Guerrilla sources have indicated they would step up attacks if
the proposal is rejected.
   The war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, mostly civilians.
Three rounds of government-guerrilla dialogue between 1984 and 1987
ended in stalemate.
   Duarte said he was not closing the door on the guerrillas.
   ``I have said I would talks with any and all who declare publicly
without conditions that violence is not the way to resolve the
country's problems and that they are ready to incorporate themselves
into the democratic process,'' he said.

   Patrick Purdy was on nothing stronger
than coffee and cigarettes when he opened fire with an AK-47 outside
an elementary school, killing five children before committing
suicide, authorities said.
   Toxicology reports performed on the body of the 24-year-old
drifter have revealed only ``a trace of nicotine and caffeine,''
Stockton Police Capt. Dennis Perry said.
   ``A cigarette and a cup of coffee,'' Perry said. ``That may be
it.''
   Police and relatives have said Purdy had a history of drug use,
and he was arrested several times on drug-related charges.
   Meanwhile, investigators probing the still-unexplained massacre,
in which 29 other students and a teacher were wounded, agreed to
look into whether Purdy had links to white supremacists. The slain
pupils were children of Southeast Asian refugees.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp ordered the background
probe at the urging of groups led by the Asian community in the San
Francisco Bay area, Kati Corsaut, a spokeswoman for the Department
of Justice, said Wednesday.
   ``What happened is that the attorney general's office received
inquiries from various groups concerned that the crime was related
to a hate crime and that he (Purdy) had racist affiliations.''
   Armed with a Soviet-style AK-47 semi-automatic rifle, Purdy,
sprayed the Cleveland Elementary School with more than 100 rounds.
Nine of the wounded children were still in Stockton area hospitals
more than eight days after the Jan. 17 killings.
   Stockton police have said there was no apparent racial motive in
the attack, even though more than 70 percent of the pupils at the
school are Asian. Purdy, described by relatives and acquaintances as
a troubled youth with a criminal history, had attended the school as
a child.
   Investigators said, however, that Purdy's anger seemed unfocused,
cutting across racial lines and changing targets daily.
   ``Through his lifetime, Mr. Purdy developed a hate for
everybody,'' said Perry.
   Before he went on his rampage, Purdy donned an olive-drab T-shirt
with slogans and words including ``Libya'' and ``PLO'' and ``Death
to the Great Satin,'' apparently his spelling for Satan. Carved on
the stock of his rifle was the word ``Hezbollah,'' the name of the
radical Shiite Moslem faction in Lebanon.

<HEAD>India Displays Its Military Might As Sikhs Try To Blow Up Train</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India today displayed its military might
at a parade marking the republic's founding 39 years ago, and Sikh
militants in Punjab killed at least three people and tried to blow
up a passenger train.
   The Press Trust of India news agency said explosives placed by
Sikh separatists went off minutes after a Pakistan-bound train
passed the track today at Khasa, four miles north of the Sikh holy
city of Amritsar.
   The explosion damaged the track, and Indian railways later
suspended train service in the area. The news agency quoted police
as saying Sikh separatists were responsible for the blast, but did
not elaborate.
   Security was tight in New Delhi for the Republic Day anniversary,
reflecting fears that Sikh extremists would try to disrupt the
celebrations. Sikh militants are campaigning for an independent
homeland in Punjab, claiming they are discriminated against by the
country's Hindu majority.
   The 1.1 million-man Indian army displayed a new bridge-laying
tank and marine helicopter in the capital amid a host of festive
floats, camel-mounted riflemen and high-stepping military bands.
   President Ramaswamy Venklataraman presided over the procession
from a reviewing stand. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the bulky shape
of a bullet-proof vest apparent beneath his high-collared gry suit,
was also present amid tight security.
   Police estimated 1 million people watched the parade.
   In the Punjab city of Amritsar, seat of the Golden Temple, the
holiest shrine of the Sikh faith, police reported calm today. But
the news agency said at least three people were killed by Sikh
radicals elsewhere in the state.
   Sikh separatists killed more than 2,400 people in Punjab last
year and so far this year have taken at least 156 lives in the rich
farm state where Sikhs comprise a slight majority.
   Fears of an attack in New Delhi were heightened by the Jan. 6
executions of two Sikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, mother of the current Indian leader.
   Rajiv Gandhi and his wife Sonia watched the military parade from
a reviewing stand along The Way of Kings. The chief guest at the
Republic Day celebrations was Nguyen Van Linh, secretary general of
Vietnam's Communist Party.
   The annual celebration marks India's declaration of a republic in
1950, three years after independence from Britain was achieved.
   One of the first new military items displayed was the Kartik
tank, developed in India. It is designed to lay bridges over dry
spans in as little as three minutes to facilitate rapid movement of
armored columns.
   Another was the Sea King helicopter, designed to carry commandos
and land on water.
   Previously seen hardware included Soviet-designed T-72 tanks and
a MiG-27 warplane. Moscow is India's chief supplier of weaponry.
   After the armor and weapons passed, the parade turned into a
procession of floats from various Indian states, school children in
starched uniforms carrying flags, and dancers twirling to the music
of high-pitched flutes and resonant drum beats.
   One drill team, cripsly attired in black and white, high-stepped
by on stilts brandishing rifles over their heads.
   Two helicopters showered 440 pounds of rose and marigold petals
on the parade route.

<HEAD>Irish Tomb Was Earliest Structure Built With Astronomical Use, Study
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of an Irish tomb built about three
centuries before Stonehenge provides new evidence that it is the
oldest known structure with an astronomical function, says a study
published today.
   The 5,000-year-old tomb was apparently designed to create a
dramatic light show that began at sunrise on the shortest day of the
year, probably for religious purposes, the study said.
   Previous research also suggested an astronomical connection.
   But this study is the first to investigate implications of the
fact that the sun rose in a different spot on the horizon when the
tomb was built than it does today, said astronomer Tom Ray of the
Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies in Ireland, whose results are
published in the British journal Nature.
   The Newgrange tomb, north of Dublin, was built around 5,100 years
ago; the first stage of Stonehenge, located on Salisbury Plains,
England, dates back about 4,800 years.
   The tomb is among the oldest of massive stone monuments found in
northwestern Europe and the British Isles, said archaeologist Curtis
Runnels of Boston University. Ray's study gives the strongest
evidence to date that even the early monuments were designed with
astronomical influence, Runnels said.
   Edwin Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles
and a researcher in ancient astronomy, said he believed previous
studies already had established an astronomical role in the tomb's
design. But the new work improves the case, he said.
   Krupp agreed that the Irish tomb is the oldest known monument
with firm evidence for astronomical design, but Runnels said that
because of uncertainties in dating, some Egyptian buildings may be
as old.
   The Newgrange tomb lies within a mound of loose stones about 90
yards wide and 35 feet tall. A corridor snakes about 60 feet into
the mound, leading to a chamber with a dome-shaped roof.
   Ray said the light show began with sunrise on the winter solstice.
   The first rays of light shot down the center of the corridor and
struck the floor in the chamber, creating a lighted spot a few feet
long and a couple inches wide, Ray said. The reflection lit a
carving that features a trio of spirals.
   The sunlight entered above the tomb's entrance through a gap
measuring about 8 inches tall and 3 feet wide, Ray said. As seen
from the chamber, the sun would appear in the lower left hand corner
of the gap, continue rising until it was framed by the gap, and then
exit at the upper right corner, he said.
   The gap was created such that when it framed the sun, it matched
the sun's width vertically within an accuracy of one-fifth or
one-sixth of the sun's radius, which is ``not bad for 5,000 years
ago,'' Ray said.
   Scientists can only gather circumstantial evidence to determine
the intentions of the Newgrange builders, Krupp said, because ``you
don't have the owner's manual.''
   The calculation that the first rays of the sun reached the back
chamber by going down the middle of the corridor gives ``a certain
kind of symmetric satisfaction ... although really we don't know if
that was the target or what the detailed meaning of that event might
have been,'' Krupp said.
   ``But to our eyes, that looks like a very satisfying place to put
a beam of light if you're into dramatic light and shadow effects.''
   Runnels said archaeologists suspect the tomb was a burial
chamber, built by an agricultural society that had not yet
discovered metal for tools.
   The society was apparently complex enough to plan and build the
elaborate tomb, with a specialist leisure class to make astronomical
observations and direct the engineering, he said.

<HEAD>The Last Survivor Of ``Scottsboro Boys'' Rape Case Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clarence Norris, the last survivor of the
``Scottsboro Boys'' rape case, which came to symbolize racial
injustice in the Deep South in the 1930s, has died. He was 76.
   He died Monday at Bronx Community Hospital after a long illness.
   The ``Scottsboro Boys'' case involved nine black teen-agers who
were accused of raping two white women in Alabama in 1931. A series
of trials dragged on until 1937, when one of the women withdrew her
accusation.
   Norris was sentenced to death three times and spent 15 years in
prison.
   He came to New York City, where he worked as a warehouseman. In
1976, when he was 64, the Alabama Pardon and Parole Board
unanimously found that he was innocent of rape charges and then-Gov.
George C. Wallace signed his pardon.
   All but the youngest defendant in the case were sentenced to
death. Although none was executed, all went to prison.
   The case began on March 25, 1931, when the youths, who had caught
a freight train as they headed north to seek jobs, were taken off
the train at Paint Rock, Ala., jailed in nearby Scottsboro on rape
charges.
   In ``The Last of the Scottsboro Boys,'' his 1979 autobiography
written with Sybil D. Washington, Norris contended that he and the
other youths were scapegoats, caught at the wrong place at the wrong
time with two white women who were afraid they would be accused of
fraternizing with blacks.
   Norris, who was born in Warm Springs, Ga., is survived by his
wife, Melba, two daughters, Deborah N. Webster and Adele Norris, all
of New York and three sisters.

<HEAD>Survey Says Americans Place High Monetary Value on Teeth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's now an eye for an eye and a tooth for
$309,000, according to a survey taken for root-canal specialists who
wanted to know how much monetary value Americans place on their
front teeth.
   The survey taken last month for the American Association of
Endodontists asked 1,023 men and women to name the smallest amount
of money they would accept for one of their healthy front teeth.
   Dr. Joseph D. Maggio, president of the association, said almost a
quarter of those surveyed refused to specify how much, saying they
would not sell such a tooth for any amount of money.
   The average amount cited by respondents who said they would take
money was $309,000, Maggio said Wednesday night.
   ``This survey tells us that people understand the importance of a
tooth to their health and quality of life,'' said Maggio, an
endodonist from Oak Brook. ``A tooth is like a computer chip. It's
small and the materials that make it up are worth only pennies, but
that's far exceeded by its functional value.''
   Maggio estimated the chemical value of an average-sized front
tooth at about 12 cents.
   Maggio said the survey specified healthy front teeth because
those are the ones most people would be least willing to part with.
   ``Obviously, we wouldn't have gotten the same results if we had
asked about wisdom teeth,'' he said.
   Maggio noted that the survey, conducted by the Opinion Research
Corp. of Princeton, N.J., found that older respondents were much
less willing to sell a tooth.
   Among respondents at least 65 years old, 42 percent said they
would accept no amount of money for a front tooth. A similar
response came from only 13 percent of those between ages 18 and 34.
   ``It could be that older people already have suffered some tooth
loss and know first hand that nothing can really replace a natural
tooth,'' Maggio suggested.
   As an endodontist, Maggio believes that everything possible
should be done to save an existing tooth, rather than pulling it and
replacing it.
   He estimates that more than 22 million root canal procedures, in
which the tooth is saved by removing the nerve, were performed in
the United States last year, compared with some 40 million tooth
extractions.
   ``In most parts of the country, a root canal can save an existing
tooth for between $275 and $700, depending on the type of tooth and
the severity of decay,'' he said. ``An extraction, if the missing
tooth is replaced with a bridge or a partial, usually winds up being
more expensive.''
   Maggio said there are 2,900 endodontists in the nation, and their
work was only recognized as a speciality by the American Dental
Association in the 1960s, even though root canal work had been
performed for many years before that.

<HEAD>Temperatures and Precipitation Don't Indicate Greenhouse Trends</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A study of temperature and precipitation data
collected over nearly a century shows the United States has not
become any hotter, drier, colder or wetter, scientists say.
   The study of data collected by weather stations across the
country from 1895 to 1987 concluded that while the nation has
experienced periods of unusual temperature and precipitation, there
has been no trend in one direction or another.
   The study, published in the current issue of Geophysical Research
Letters, does not support the ``rising notion'' that there have been
major climatic changes in this country, researcher George Maul of
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said here
Wednesday night.
   The findings don't necessarily cast doubt on previous findings of
a worldwide warming trend and have no bearing on the
greenhouse-effect theory that a buildup of carbon dioxide and
pollutants is acting like a greenhouse and causing such warming,
lead researcher Kirby Hanson said in interviews with The New York
Times and the Los Angeles Times.
   Hanson, a meteorologist, pointed out that the United States
occupies only a small percentage of the Earth's surface, and said
the new findings may be the result of regional variations.
   Last July, James Hansen of the National Aviation and Space
Administration's Goddard Institute startled members of Congress when
he testified that unusually hot conditions, such as last summer's
drought and rash of wildfires, could be forerunners of the
greenhouse effect.
   Hansen said temperatures had risen nearly 1 degree worldwide
during the last century.
   He said Wednesday that he had no quarrel with the new study's
findings.
   ``We are just arguing now about whether the global warming effect
is large enough to see,'' Hanson said. ``It is not surprising we are
not seeing it in a region (the 48 contiguous states) that covers
only 1.5 percent of the globe.''
   Maul said the study indicates scientists need to be cautious in
concluding whether the United States can detect a greenhouse effect.

   A 16-year-old student started grabbing
children and ``throwing them out the door'' as their school bus
skidded off a muddy road and into a creek, but he couldn't reach an
8-year-old who sank before his eyes.
   The child and the driver, who rejected the teen-ager's offers of
help, died Wednesday after being trapped underwater for more than an
hour, authorities said. Eleven other students escaped after the
accident 40 miles southeast of Kansas City.
   ``I saw the other little boy in the water, and I tried to grab
for him underneath the water,'' said 16-year-old Bill Raley, one of
12 students on the bus. ``I didn't even get to touch him. I tried.
He went under and I never saw him again.''
   Killed were Dale R. Thomasson, 46, a teacher, counselor and
school bus driver, and Loren Newkirk II, 8, both of Wellsville in
rural east-central Kansas.
   The two were trapped beneath the front axle of the bus until
wreckers pulled it from the creek, Franklin County Deputy Sheriff
Craig Davis said. Loren was freed and survived more than four hours
before being pronounced dead at a hospital. The cause of death was
listed as drowning.
   A preliminary autopsy showed Thomasson died from massive,
crushing injuries, Davis said.
   The bus was en route to Wellsville's school complex, about 10
miles northeast of Ottawa, when it slowed for a curve on a gravel
road made muddy by early-morning rains. The bus ran off the road
after the turn, Davis said.
   It slid onto the bridge rail over Walnut Creek, then tipped to
its side and landed upside down on the top of a 9-foot embankment,
Davis said. The bus then began sliding into the creek, which was as
deep as 6 feet.
   Raley said another student opened the back emergency exit and the
two helped students jump out onto a muddy embankment as water poured
in the front door.
   ``I just started grabbing them and throwing them out the door,''
he said.
   Raley said he fell down and slid to the front of the bus, where
the water was deeper.
   He tried to reach for Loren, who disappeared into the water.
   ``I yelled to Mr. T, `Do you need my help?' He just said, `Get
the heck out!'' Raley said.
   The youth said he jumped out the back and swam to the bank, then
ran up the road to a house and called an ambulance.
   Davis said Thomasson apparently grabbed Loren and jumped into the
water just as the bus rolled over onto them.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Says Sardine Shoplifting Not Worth Life Sentence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Clyde Ashley Jr. shoplifted two cans of
sardines, ate them in the store and then tried to steal money to pay
for them. For that, the ex-convict was sentenced to life in prison
as a habitual offender.
   On Wednesday, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that the
sentence, handed down in 1986, was overly harsh. Ashley was properly
convicted for his ``great sardine caper,'' the court said in
ordering the trial judge to reconsider the sentence.
   As evidence of the ``seemingly undue harshness'' of the sentence,
Justice James Robertson noted that prosecutors had said they
wouldn't oppose a lighter sentence in the case.
   According to the court records, Ashley, now 44, was paroled on
Dec. 13, 1985, after spending 23 years in prison on a series of
burglaries and one attempted robbery _ each time under the influence
of alcohol.
   On Jan. 15, 1986, Ashley, after being rebuffed in attempts to get
money from 85-year-old Eva Washington, entered a small grocery store
in Osyka in Pike County and was seen opening and eating two cans of
sardines.
   ``Once more while drinking Ashley rather pathetically and
pitifully again ran afoul of the law,'' said Robertson, writing for
the high court.
   According to court records, when the owner of the store cornered
Ashley and asked for payment for the sardines, Ashely said he would
go to his aunt's house to get some money.
   The owner went with Ashley to see Washington, who was not
actually his aunt. The store owner waited outside and called police
when Ashley did not return. Police found Ashley hiding in a closet
inside the house.
   Ashley was convicted of burglary for breaking into the house. The
judge, reviewing his criminal record, determined that Ashley was a
habitual offender and issued the sentence of life without parole.

<HEAD>Second Leak In Week Reported At Superfund Site In Nitro</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NITRO, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moisture and waste acid reacted together to
blow the lid off a 55-gallon drum, causing the second leak at an
abandoned chemical plant in a week, a federal Environmental
Protection Agency official said.
   A small vapor cloud dispersed before EPA officials could
determine how wide an area it covered. There were no reports of
injury to anyone in or near the former Artel Chemical Co. plant.
   EPA on-site coordinator Jerry Saseen said officials wouldn't know
until later today what chemical was stored in the drum that blew up
Wednesday at the Superfund site. EPA officials said the drum was
located in the same area of the plant where a Jan. 19 leak occurred.
   Last week's accident was also caused by moisture reacting with a
chemical stored in a 55-gallon drum. There was a similar leak last
fall.
   Both Saseen and Nitro Mayor Don Karnes blamed unusually warm
weather for causing condensation inside the drums. Temperatures have
been fluctuating from the 20s and 30s to the 50s and 60s during a
January warm spell.
   ``Until we get more even temperatures, we could have situations
like this,'' Saseen said. ``The situation is ripe that this can
happen, many, many, many times. ... I believe we will be
experiencing these things over and over until the warm weather is
over.''
   Saseen said the leak was neutralized with lime and soda ash. He
said an EPA crew would remain at the scene overnight.
   ``We have literally thousands of drums here. It's a very, very
fragile situation,'' Saseen said.
   Cleanup crews could begin moving more than 5,000 drums of toxic
and hazardous chemicals from the abandoned plant as early as
mid-February, said EPA official Doug Fox. The plant was closed and
turned over to the EPA in June after the federal government declared
it a public health hazard.
   Last week's leak involved thionyl chloride, a potentially
poisonous chemical used in the manufacture of pesticides. There were
no injuries, but a 19-block area of Nitro was sealed off and about
2,500 of the town's 8,000 residents were confined to their homes for
more than an hour.
   Karnes said he did not give an order confining residents to
shelter in the latest incident. The mayor, who had expressed
displeasure over a lengthy delay between last week's leak and the
time the EPA notified Nitro officials, said the reaction to
Wednesday's leak was much faster.
   Nitro, built in World War I to manufacture explosives, lies along
the Kanawha River in an area known as Chemical Valley that is the
site of more than two dozen chemical plants.
   There have been several chemical leaks in the area during the
past decade. In 1985, 135 people were hospitalized after methyl
isocyanate leaked from a Union Carbide plant in Institute. The plant
was similar to one in Bhopal, India, that leaked the year before,
killing more than 2,000 people.

<HEAD>KKK Sues to Get Cable TV Access</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a lawsuit filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union, the Ku Klux Klan contends that the City Council
violated its right to free speech by denying it an outlet on cable
television.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court on Wednesday, asks that
American Cablevision re-establish its public access channel so that
the Klan can broadcast a white supremicist program called ``Klansas
City.''
   The Kansas City Council eliminated the public access station in
June rather than broadcast the Missouri Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan's show. In its place, American Cablevision established a
community access channel over which it exercises editorial control.
   The lawsuit says the council's decision was ``motivated by the
desire to suppress the racialist viewpoint'' of the Klan.
   Councilman John Sharp said the City Council welcomes the suit
``because it was our intention to set a precedent that could be
followed by other cities throughout the nation. The issue is whether
the city has the right to require every cable television subscriber
to subsidize the Klan's propaganda.''
   Dick Kurtenbach, executive director for the local ACLU chapter,
said his organization found the Klan's white supremacist ideology
abhorrent, and believed Klan members should be prosecuted if they
used a television show to incite violence or other criminal activity.
   However, he said, ``our client here is the First Amendment. The
Klan is only the vehicle.''
   The ACLU has represented the Klan and other right-wing groups on
numerous occasions in the past.
   Local governments typically require cable companies to have
public access channels before granting them operating licenses. The
channels are designed to allow a public forum and are protected by
federal law from editorial control.
   The Kansas City controversy began in August 1987 when the Klan
sought permission to use the public access channel to show ``Race
and Reason,'' a series produced by Tom Metzger, a Californian and
Klan organizer who founded the White Aryan Resistance movement.
   American Cablevison officials said shows on the public access
channel must be produced locally and denied the request. The Klan
then applied for permission to broadcast ``Klansas City,'' which the
group would produce after being trained by cable company employees.
   That led to the council's decision to abandon the channel.
   The Klan applied to broadcast ``Klansas City'' on the new
community access channel, but the request was denied in August.
Robert B. Niles, president of American Cablevision, told Moran in a
letter that ``your proposal does not meet the needs of the channel.''

   A smoky fire that erupted in a snack bar
storeroom at Kennedy International Airport injured 34 people, forced
the evacuation of 600 passengers and delayed four flights,
authorities say.
   The west wing of the International Arrivals Building was shut
down through the night but most of it, except for at least three
aircraft gates damaged in the fire, was expected to reopen this
morning, said Armando Arrastia, a Port Authority spokesman.
   The cause of the blaze was under investigation but there was no
reason to believe it was suspicious, said Efrain Parrilla, a Fire
Department spokesman.
   The fire broke out Wednesday night on the second floor in a
storage area containing paper and metal goods for an adjacent snack
bar-souvenir store and other restaurants in the building, he said.
   ``The flames did not spread quickly but the smoke did,'' Parrilla
said.
   Damage to the building was light, Parrilla said.
   More than 150 firefighters fought the blaze, which was declared
under control within 1{ hours.
   Air France, El Al Israel Airlines, Air Afrique and Royal Air
Maroc flights, which were using gates near the snack bar, were
delayed about three hours because of the fire, said Arrastia. The
flights left from the east wing of the building, he said.
   Twenty-six people injured were taken to hospitals, the others
were treated at the scene, said Capt. Mark Rothstein of the
Emergency Medical Services. Most suffered smoke inhalation, and none
of the injuries were life threatening, authorities said.

<HEAD>Former President Chun Refuses To Testify On 1980 Uprising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan refused
today to accept a writ to testify before a National Assembly
committee on the suppression of a 1980 uprising that left at least
200 people dead.
   Chun, in voluntary exile at an isolated Buddhist temple, said in
a statement he takes responsibility for putting down the Kwangju
uprising, but does not intend to appear before the panel
investigating the matter.
   ``I think I was in a position to take moral and political
responsibility , so I have no intention to avoid responsibility,''
Chun said.
   Former President Choi Kyu-ha, who briefly held office before Chun
took power with military backing in 1980, also refused today to
accept a writ to testify.
   Both former presidents said previously that as former heads of
state they could not be compelled to testify. President Roh Tae-woo
has backed Chun's refusal to testify despite widespread criticism.
   About 500 radical students from several Seoul colleges clashed
with riot police at Dongguk University today to demand the arrest of
Roh and Chun. They hurled hundreds of firebombs and rocks at police
surrounding the school.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan!'' and ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' students
yelled.
   No serious injuries or arrests were reported in the fighting.
   The opposition is trying to use the Kwangju incident and other
legacies of the authoritarian Chun regime to weaken its successor,
the nearly year-old Roh government. Roh, a former general and close
ally of Chun, is still identified with the ex-president in the eyes
of many Koreans.
   Writs were issued to the two ex-presidents as the special
committee resumed its hearing today into the 1980 uprising in the
southern city of Kwangju. The opposition-controlled National
Assembly has been investigating allegations of human rights abuses
and corruption under Chun.
   By official count, about 200 people were killed and more than
1,000 injured in the army's suppressiong of the uprising. Opposition
groups claim the casualty toll was much higher and the uprising
remains a highly charged issue.
   Chun was in control of the armed forces at the time and became
president a few months later. Choi, a former prime minister, briefly
served as a figurehead president.
   In his statement, Chun said he would testify ``indirectly''
instead of appearing before the committee, but gave no details. Chun
had indicated he would answer questions in writing.
   ``I spend time here looking back on the past with regrets and
repentance and I wish I could have healed the scars of the Kwangju
incident while in office,'' he said in his message from the temple
on the west coast.
   Under Korean law, the parliamentary committee has the power to
refer the case to the prosecution for legal action, but the
prosecution must decide whether to act.
   If the former presidents are charged and convicted of contempt of
parliament, they could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
   Chun is also being pressed to testify before another
parliamentary committee investigating corruption and other misdeeds.
   The former president has denied any personal wrongdoing, but he
surrendered $24 million and went into rural exile after apologizing
to the nation in November. About a dozen members of the
ex-president's family have been arrested or convicted on corruption
charges.

<HEAD>Groundbreaking For May 4 Memorial Includes Protests</HEAD>

   Kent State University officials broke ground
for a scaled-down memorial to the four students killed by Ohio
National Guardsmen in 1970, despite a silent protest by students and
donors who say the new design is inadequate.
   The groundbreaking Wednesday for the May 4 Memorial followed
unanimous approval by university trustees to build a $100,000
memorial on a campus hill near where guardsmen shot 13 students,
killing four, on May 4, 1970.
   About 30 people stood in silence about 20 yards from speakers at
the groundbreaking, holding signs protesting plans for the memorial.
   The trustees Nov. 15 agreed to reduce the cost of the memorial
from $1.2 million to $100,000 after a fund-raising campaign netted
only $40,000.
   ``I don't like the autocratic method by which decisions were
made,'' said Glenn Frank, a geology professor at the university for
32 years who recently retired.
   Frank said he was among donors who, along with a group of
students known as the May 4 Task Force, hired attorneys to represent
their concern that the original design not be altered.
   ``They can't just use their money and build something else,''
said attorney William Whittaker of Kent, who with John Lawson of
Cleveland represents the donors and students.
   Whittaker said they were prepared Wednesday to ask Portage County
Common Pleas Judge George Martin to issue a temporary restraining
order halting all work on the memorial.
   However, KSU attorneys agreed to contact all donors regarding the
change in memorial plans before construction starts, said Lawson,
adding that a restraining order was not necessary.
   About 300 people turned out for the groundbreaking, where Dean
Kahler, one of nine students wounded when the guardsmen fired on the
students, spoke from his wheelchair.
   ``There is still a stigma and that incident affects all the
alumni,'' said Kahler, who was crippled in the shooting.
   ``Today's events mark the culmination of that stigma. We don't
have to scratch the scab May 4 every year anymore,'' said Kahler,
now a second-term Athens County commissioner who attends yearly
candlelight vigils commemorating the shootings.
   ``It is time for final resolution,'' said William Risman,
chairman of the board of trustees. ``The size and cost of the
memorial are not of importance and not of true consequence.''
   The memorial will consist of four granite pylons _ representing
the four students who were killed _ and concrete walkways built on a
terraced hillside.
   Architect Bruno Ast said the scaled-down version is a portion of
the original design.
   Jeffrey Miller, Allison Krause, Sandra Scheuer and William
Schroeder were killed when more than 60 shots were fired after
then-Gov. James A. Rhodes sent the guardsmen to the campus during
the fourth day of student protests during the Vietnam War. The
students were protesting the U.S. invasion of Cambodia.
   George Janik, 56, former chairman of the board of trustees, said
the original memorial could have been built if the fund-raising
campaign, which was directed at alumni who attended school about the
time of the shootings, had been improved.
   ``It's a project that needed to be sold,'' Janik said. ``That's
what I think was missing.''

   The first woman to be elected a bishop of the
Episcopal Church says she hopes her precedent-setting position will
encourage other women, but she plans to devote herself to religious,
not political, duties.
   ``I do not intend to be an international Anglican gadfly, moving
around to promote ordination of women, but I will be as supportive
as possible,'' the Rev. Barbara C. Harris said Wednesday.
   Her election in September as suffragan, or assisting bishop,
touched off a spirited debate among Episcopalians over her
background and qualifications as well as her gender. The election
was formally approved Tuesday by a majority of the 118 U.S. bishops.
   In her first public comments since her election, Harris said she
was glad the approval process was over.
   ``While it has not all been sweetness and light, it has certainly
been bearable because of the support, affirmation and love and
prayerful support I have had,'' she said.
   Harris was joined at a news conference by presiding Bishop David
E. Johnson of Boston, who said a full and formal consecration would
be held Feb. 11. He said it could be one of the largest affairs of
its kind.
   Harris, a former public relations executive who is black, said
she believed racism may have played a part in some of the criticisms
of her background and qualifications.
   ``Given that racism is so prevalent in our society and so woven
into the fabric of our lives, ... I am certain that there was some
element of racism present in some of the objections,'' she said.
   Harris was criticized for being too liberal, for being divorced
and for lacking a college or seminary degree. She acknowledged that
she still had to overcome some opposition.
   ``We recognize that this presents a problem for some people,
theologically and emotionally,'' she said, ``and we must always be
about helping or attempting to help them to understand what this
means in the life of the church and to move toward some
reconciliation with them as far as is possible.''

<TEXT>
   The government today released two
leading opposition lawmakers and three other politicians it had held
without trial for 15 months, but parliament's opposition leader
remained in custody.
   The five were released because the government felt they no longer
post a threat to the country's security, police sources said on
condition of anonymity.
   They were among 106 people rounded up in October 1987 and held
without trial under the Internal Security Act in a move Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamed said was necessary to prevent
Malay-Chinese racial clashes.
   Only two of the original 106 remained in detention after today's
releases _ the Democratic Action Party's secretary-general and the
leader of the opposition in Parliament, Lim Kit Siang, and his son,
Lim Guan Eng.
   Reduan Aslie, public relations officer at federal police
headquarters, said those released today included parliament members
Karpal Singh, the party's vice chairman when he was arrested, and
Perumal Patto, its deputy secretary general.
   Also released from the Kemunting detention camp near Ipoh, 125
miles north of Kuala Lumpur, were opposition People's Socialist
Party member Mohamad Nasir Hashim, opposition Pan Malaysian Islamic
Party Baling branch secretary Mohamed Yusof Hussein and party member
Kamarulzaman Che Ismail, Reduan said.
   Under Malaysian law, anyone detained under the Internal Security
Act must give up his party posts, although he can remain a member of
the party and of parliament.
   At the time of the arrests, Mahathir also banned three
newspapers, citing similar reasons. They were allowed to resume
publishing four months later.
   Currently, about 65 people are being held under the Internal
Security Act.
   When Mahathir became prime minister in July 1981, 550 people were
detained under the act. He called for a review and released most of
them.

<TEXT>
   With the competition heating up to conquer one of
ballooning's final frontiers, a British adventurer is racing to meet
a spring liftoff date in an attempt to be the first to circle the
globe by balloon.
   ``We feel it's the ultimate challenge for balloonists at the
moment,'' said Julian Nott, leader of the attempt and an experienced
balloonist who has set 79 records.
   At a news conference Wednesday at the Explorers Club, Nott, 44,
said he and 33-year-old copilot Buddy Squires would take off in
their 10-story high, helium-filled balloon at the end of March from
a World War II blimp hangar near Los Angeles.
   ``The race is on,'' Nott said. ``There have been five attempts,
other people are talking about making attempts. There are a lot of
people who've announced they are going to make flights, but there's
no one who's actually shown any hardware.''
   Nott predicted he and Squires would succeed where others have
failed because a pressurized crew cabin would allow his balloon to
sail in the relative calm of the jet stream, well above the stormy
weather of lower altitudes.
   The balloonists intend to soar to 35,000 feet, head east over the
southern United States, the Atlantic Ocean, North Africa, Saudi
Arabia, India, Southeast Asia and China, and set down in California
some 25,000 miles and 18 days later.
   Nott said he had permission from about 35 foreign countries to
float over their territory. He said the voyage has cost about $1.5
million so far.
   The announcement was not the first time the British balloonist
had said he would try to fly non-stop around the world. At a 1986
news conference, Nott told reporters he would lift off in March 1987
from western Australia and head east over New Zealand and the South
Pacific. That plan was scrapped a few months later.
   Nott admitted Wednesday he had been overly optimistic and
underestimated the complexity of his ambitions.
   ``It's just taken longer than we thought,'' he said. ``Everybody
involved has been a little bit overwhelmed. It's simply a bigger
effort than we thought.''

<TEXT>
   Serial killer Ted Bundy, executed this week, may
have killed more than 100 girls and young women in murderous sex
rages from coast to coast, says an investigator who tracked him for
15 years.
   ``My feeling is he has killed way over 100,'' said Bob Keppel,
who as a King County detective investigated the eight ``Ted''
killings that occurred in western Washington in 1974, the first that
were connected to Bundy.
   In a frenzy of last-minute confessions that brought Keppel and a
parade of investigators from other states to Florida State Prison,
Bundy confessed to all eight and 15 more nationwide, and provided
information on dozens of others.
   Keppel, now a Washington state attorney general's investigator,
acknowledged that exact numbers may never be known and offered no
details to support his estimate at a news conference Wednesday.
   He did play excerpts from a chilling tape recording of a
confession Bundy made Friday to the killing of University of
Washington student Georgann Hawkins, one of the ``Ted'' victims.
   The slayings were so called because witnesses recalled seeing a
handsome young stranger named ``Ted'' in areas where several victims
disappeared.
   Bundy described a trademark ruse in which he outfitted himself
with crutches or a sling or cast, then asked young women for help in
carrying books or other items to his car, where he knocked them
unconscious and drove away to murder them.
   ``I ... asked her to help me carry the briefcase, which she did
and we walked back up the alley,'' toward his car, Bundy said on the
tape. ``When we reached the car, ... I knocked her unconscious with
the crowbar. ... There were some handcuffs there, along with the
crowbar. ... I handcuffed her and put her in the passenger's side of
the car and drove away.
   ``She was unconscious but very much alive.''
   He said Ms. Hawkins regained consciousness, and described driving
her to the foothills near Issaquah, 15 miles east of Seattle, where
he killed her. But Keppel stopped the tape before Bundy recounted
the gruesome details _ out of respect, he said, for the victim's
family.
   ``It's bad. That's about all I can say,'' Keppel said.
   ``I was shocked,'' he said of the way the victims were treated,
adding that investigators hadn't known Bundy's methods because the
victims were found weeks and months after their deaths, and many
bones had been scattered by animals.
   Bundy, 42, was executed Tuesday for the 1978 kidnap, rape and
murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach. He was also convicted in
Florida of the 1978 murders of two sorority sisters.
   Investigators who spent time with him during his last days
compared notes and when they added cases up, realized Bundy had been
involved in up to 50 homicides.
   Florida State Attorney Jerry Blair said FBI agent Bill Hagmeier
told him that Bundy's confessions closed the books on 13 killings in
Washington, Utah and Colorado; provided information that may never
be confirmed on 14 more cases in Washington, Utah, Idaho,
California, Vermont and Pennsylvania; and touched on at least 20
more slayings in various states dating back to 1969.
   Arthur Norman, a forensic psychologist on Bundy's defense team in
1986 and 1987, said after the execution that Bundy earlier admitted
killing two women in New Jersey in May 1969. But a Bundy lawyer,
Polly J. Nelson, said Bundy had denied killing anyone during his
time in Philadelphia.
   Norman said Bundy, after many hours of talking, admitted the 1969
murders of Susan Davis, 19, of Camp Hill, Pa., and Elizabeth Perry,
19, of Excelsior, Minn., on the New Jersey shore, The Oregonian
newspaper of Portland reported.
   Ms. Perry's father, Ray P. Perry, who lives in Seattle, said the
possibility of Bundy being connected with his daughter's murder had
briefly crossed his mind recently, ``considering what's been in the
papers.''
   But he added that he needs more than a report of a confession
before believing Bundy committed the murder.
   Bundy, who grew up in Tacoma, was a 22-year-old student at Temple
University in Philadelphia at the time. He returned to the Seattle
area in the summer of 1969.
   Keppel said Bundy, a law school dropout and one-time Republican
activist in Washington state, remained cold-blooded and manipulative
to the last as he meted out information on his victims in hopes of
delaying his execution.
   ``The whole thing was orchestrated from the very beginning,''
Keppel said of the law enforcement officers invited by Bundy to
prison late last week.
   The only sorrow Bundy felt at the end, despite his tears, was for
himself, Keppel said. He added that the murderer's final interview,
laying some of the blame for his madness on a youthful ``addiction''
to pornography, was nonsense.
   ``Pornography is maybe one-one-thousandth of the whole problem he
had,'' Keppel said, calling Bundy's interview with James Dobson, a
religious broadcaster and psychologist, ``totally self-serving.''
   Keppel has interviewed Bundy several times during the past few
years, and said he would take the information gathered in his latest
sessions and present it to other law enforcement agencies in hopes
it will help solve some still-unexplained murders.

<TEXT>
   Gynecologist James C. Burt has surrendered
his license to practice medicine, but remains unbowed before
challenges to his self-described ``love surgery.''
   The State Medical Board announced Wednesday that it had accepted
Burt's offer to surrender his Ohio medical license, and said the
``surrender-revocation'' also includes a requirement that Burt, 67,
not practice medicine anywhere in the country.
   But in a statement accompanying the announcement, Burt again
denied that he had ever performed the surgery _ a physical
alteration of female genitalia aimed at enhancing sexual
responsiveness _ without patient consent.
   ``Every patient I have ever delivered or operated upon has had at
least one informed consent,'' said Burt, who practiced in Dayton.
   Last month, the State Medical Board charged Burt with ``gross
immorality'' for 41 alleged violations ranging from overprescribing
drugs to performing unnecessary surgeries. The board charged that
the surgery caused sexual dysfunction, emotional distress,
infection, chronic pain, incontinence and the need for corrective
surgery in many patients.
   At least three malpractice lawsuits are pending against Burt,
each asking $3 million in damages. The women say Burt performed the
surgery without their consent. Burt has denied the charges.
   Burt had faced a Jan. 30 hearing before the medical board, but
the panel said its acceptance of the ``surrender-revocation''
eliminates the necessity for formal disciplinary hearings, since
license revocation is the maximum penalty the board can impose on a
licensee.
   Burt's attorney, Earl Moore, said the doctor had been considering
retirement for some time and did not believe the board would treat
him fairly.
   ``He will write and lecture and give seminars,'' Moore said.
``The saga of Doctor Burt is far from over. He's more concerned now
about helping his patients and friends and other doctors.''
   Moore said Burt might continue to promote his surgical technique.
   The matter was brought to public attention when the CBS-TV news
show ``West 57th'' aired a report on Burt's so-called ``female
circumcision'' technique.
   The procedure involved the reconstruction and relocation of the
vagina and the removal of flesh covering the clitoris, an external
tissue that responds to sexual stimulation. Burt described the
technique in his 1975 book, ``Surgery of Love.''
   Burt performed 170 of the operations at St. Elizabeth Medical
Center in Dayton, the last one in February 1987. He agreed to stop
performing the surgery at the hospital last November at the request
of hospital officials.
   Hospital officials said Tuesday that an internal investigation
concluded that all 170 operations were done with patient consent and
that the hospital plans no further action against Burt.

<HEAD>Nuns To Move Out Of Concentration Camp, Archbishop Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Carmelite nuns who were criticized for
setting up a convent inside Auschwitz will move to a site outside
the former Nazi death camp where millions died, the Archibishop of
Lyon said today.
   In a written statement, the archbishop, Cardinal Albert
Decourtray, said he was informed by Cardinal Francicus Macharski of
Krakow that the nuns would be installed in a new convent to be built
outside the center of the Polish camp.
   The monastery was established by a dozen nuns in 1984 in a former
theater in the middle of Auschwitz, setting off a storm of protest
by European Jews who believe the camp should be left as an
undisturbed memorial to its victims.
   Jewish leaders met Dec. 20 in Paris with four Roman Catholic
cardinals to disucss progress toward moving the convent to another
location by February 1989, a deadline set in earlier meetings.
   Today's statement said the nuns will ``live in their new convent
which will be constructed on separate land.'' Decourtray did not
provide details on where the new building would be constructed.
   ``We can wait now for the imminent execution of the convent's
construction that will permit the Carmelites to leave the old
theater,'' the statement said.
   It said the sisters would continue to provide a center for
information, education and prayer at the new location.
   Theo Klein, president of the Council of French Jewish
Institutions, said in a statement today the accord with the
Carmelite sisters was important but that Jewish leaders regretted it
took 30 months for the Polish church to act.
   Klein said he was waiting for details on ``the measures that will
be taken ... by our Catholic partners.''

   A diversionary ``flash-bang'' grenade used by
police in a drug raid may have started the fire that killed an
elderly couple, officials said.
   The police high-risk entry team used a battering ram to break a
window at an apartment Wednesday night, then tossed in the grenade
to divert the occupants' attention and entered the place, said
Police Chief John Laux.
   The apartment was filled with smoke, and officers tried to put
out the fire, but it spread too quickly, the chief said.
   Police and three people inside the apartment fled the building.
The fire, which was confined to the apartment in the 10-unit
complex, was extinguished 15 minutes later.
   The victims, whose names were not immediately released, were
found in a rear bedroom, said Fire Capt. Clarence Matson. Two other
people who had been in the unit, a mother and her child, were
treated at a hospital and released.
   Laux said it was uncertain whether the grenade _ which produces a
blinding light and a popping noise _ caused the fire, but he said
officials would investigate.
   Such devices have been used before and had not caused fires, he
said. ``This was a very routine operation and entry,'' Laux said.
   Two people were arrested in the raid, he said.

<TEXT>
   The most prominent liberal
member of Parliament said today that she will seek the impeachment
of a judge for his lenient sentencing of a white farmer who beat a
black worker to death.
   Helen Suzman's announcement came as the Johannesburg Bar Council,
in a rare denunciation of a judicial decision, said it was outraged
by the sentence.
   The farmer, Jacobus Vorster, tied one of his workers to a tree
and beat him with fists and whips over a two-day period in December
1987 because the black man, Eric Sambo, accidentally killed one of
Vorster's dogs with a tractor.
   In November, Justice J.J. Strydom gave Vorster a five-year
sentence that was suspended on condition he pay a 3,000 rand
($1,360) fine and pay 130 rand ($55) a month to Sambo's widow and
children for five years.
   The lawyers' council, in a statement today in the Johannesburg
newspaper Business Day, said the suspended jail term and fine were
``so grossly inappropriate as to induce not simply a state of shock,
but one of outrage.''
   The sentence imposed by Strydom in the northern town of Louis
Trichardt occurred after Vorster, 22, pleaded guilty to culpable
homicide, an intermediate charge between murder and manslaughter
when there is no clear proof of premeditation.
   The judge said Vorster's guilt was lessened because of his youth
and the fact that he had consumed liquor prior to the assault.
   South African criminal law does not set specific maximum
sentences, leaving that to the judge's discretion. But the head of
the bar council, Max Labe, said Vorster should have been given a
``substantial'' prison term. Labe said in a telephone interview that
culpable homicide sentences usually are less than 10 years but that
this killing was particularly brutal.
   Mrs. Suzman, the longest-serving parliament member with the
anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party, said she would move for
Strydom's impeachment when parliament reconvenes Feb. 3.
   She described the sentence as ``outrageously lenient.''
   The Johannesburg Bar Council said it usually did not comment on
court rulings, but felt this case was exceptional.
   ``If there grew up in the community a belief that such a crime
could merit so trivial a punishment, the maintenance of law and
order would be gravely endangered, and no law-abiding citizen would
be safe from violent and callous killers,'' the council said.
   Vorster's sentence contrasts with the death sentences issued to
several blacks who are awaiting execution at Pretoria Central prison
for murdering white farmers.

   A murder suspect who had been taken to a
hospital dropped his crutches and took off ``like a jackrabbit,''
escaping from a sheriff's deputy, authorities said.
   ``Evidently, his leg was not as bad as believed,'' said Tim
Killian, assistant administrator at the St. Louis County Jail.
   Dennis John Hannuksela, 29, formerly of Gilbert, fled Wednesday
outside the Northland Medical Center, Killian said. He had been in
for a routine visit and was being taken back to the car, said Sgt.
Tom Person, a supervisor at the jail.
   ``The deputy didn't have him in handcuffs, because you don't
handcuff a man on crutches,'' Person said. ``He was unlocking the
car when he heard the crutches drop and looked up to see Hannuksela
running like a jackrabbit.''
   The deputy, who was not identified, chased the suspect but lost
him, authorities said.
   Person said that Hannuksela's injury wasn't faked and speculated
that the prisoner, ``anticipating his escape, punched up his
adrenaline to the point that he could run like crazy.''

<TEXT>
   British Ambassador Allan Ramsay, escorted
by heavily armed bodyguards, crossed Beirut's dividing Green Line
into the city's Moslem sector today to investigate reports British
hostages might soon be freed.
   Patrick McCabe, Ireland's ambassador to Lebanon, said he also
would head for Beirut from his office in Iraq to investigate the
reports.
   One of the British hostages is Brian Keenan, a Belfast teacher
with dual British and Irish nationality whose release is also sought
by the Ireland.
   A British Embassy spokesman confirmed Ramsay was in west Beirut
and indicated he was trying to check reports that Keenan and
possibly British journalist John McCarthy would be released.
   The other Briton missing in Lebanon is Anglican Church envoy
Terry Waite.
   Ramsay denied his visit had a special significance.
   ``I often come to west Beirut, and there's nothing significant in
my current visit,'' he told The Associated Press by telephone when
asked if it was in connection with the reports.
   He said none of the reports ``can be verified ... I'm anxious to
avoid speculation on that subject.''
   The envoy spoke from the British consular section in west Beirut.
   No faction has claimed to hold Waite, Keenan or McCarthy.
   They are among the 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, held
hostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   There was no immediate word on where Ramsay went in west Beirut
or whom he planned to meet. ``We have heard a report and we're
making inquiries,'' said the embassy spokesman, on condition of
anonymity.
   Earlier, Christian-run Voice of Lebanon radio said prospects that
British hostages would soon be freed were growing.
   Most hostage releases in the past have been preceded by
statements from the kidnappers. No such statements about Keenan or
McCarthy have been reported.
   McCarthy, 31, a producer for the London-based Worldwide
Television News agency, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, as he drove to
Beirut airport to fly to London. Keenan, 38, an English teacher at
the American University of Beirut, was kidnapped in west Beirut six
days earlier.
   Waite was kidnapped Jan. 20, 1987 while on a mission to negotiate
the release of hostages.
   McCabe told The Associated Press in the Iraqi capital: ``I'll go
to Beirut on the first available flight to investigate rumors there
about the Irish hostage. But as you know there are many rumors in
Beirut.''
   He said he had not received any specific information regarding
any other hostage and noted he was not in a position to say whether
he would negotiate with anyone about the hostages.
   Sources in Belfast said the Foreign Ministry told Keenan's family
it hoped to have ``good news'' on the hostage soon. Keenan's two
sisters were reported to be planning to fly to Beirut.
   In Dublin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said: ``At the moment,
all we have are rumors from Beirut, but obviously we hope something
will come from these rumors.''
   Hana Naja, a Lebanese assistant at the Irish consular section in
west Beirut, told The AP: ``We have no solid information yet'' about
Keenan being released.
   There has been a flurry of activity by Irish officials over
Middle East issues in recent days.
   Irish Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan met Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati of Iran in Paris two weeks ago during an
international conference on chemical weapons.
   Ireland's Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Declan Connolly, flew to
Damascus, the Syrian capital, after the Paris meeting and held talks
with Syrian government officials on undisclosed topics.
   Officials in Damascus said Connolly also met Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria on Wednesday night in Damascus.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains 40,000 troops
in eastern and northern provinces as well as Beirut's Moslem sectors.
   The Syrians, Iran's main Arab allies, have been instrumental in
negotiating the release of several foreign hostages in recent years.
   The reports of a possible release came amid a thaw in relations
between Britain and Tehran. They reestablished full diplomatic
relations in November after a 17-month rift.
   A 23-year-old Briton, Nicholas Nicola, who had been held in Iran
for two years after a shooting incident, was freed earlier this
month, raising hopes Britons held in Lebanon might also be freed.

<HEAD>Soldiers Prevent Funeral March, Kill One Palestinian</HEAD>

   Israeli troops shot and killed one Palestinian
and wounded three in a clash that occurred after the soldiers
prevented a West Bank village from holding a funeral march, the army
said today.
   The soldiers fired Wednesday night as the villagers fled after
they were told to stop, said an army spokeswoman who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In violence today, Arab hospital officials said at least 10
Palestinians were shot and wounded by soldiers in the Gaza Strip.
   Also today, troops bulldozed four houses in the West Bank village
of Aqraba, blew up one in the town of Tulkarem, and sealed one in
each of the two sites, the army said. The houses belonged to
families of Palestinians suspected of throwing firebombs at Israeli
troops and cars, an army spokeswoman said.
   The United States and human rights groups have criticized
demolitions as a violation of international law because no legal
hearing is held first.
   The clash outside the West Bank village of Hable began Wednesday
evening after the army lifted a curfew, Arab reporters said.
   Villagers immediately tried to organize a funeral march for a
youth killed in a clash Tuesday, but troops looking for suspects in
previous violence met the residents in an olive grove, the army
spokeswoman said.
   Soldiers shot at the legs of the villagers after they ignored a
call to disperse and warning shots fired in the air, she said.
   She said one Palestinian was killed and three were wounded. Arab
reporters said one of the wounded was in critical condition with
head and chest wounds.
   The death brought to 369 the number of Palestinians killed in the
13-month uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories,
which Israel seized from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
War. Fifteen Israelis have died.
   The Cabinet on Wednesday discussed the army's new orders on the
freer use of plastic bullets. Several legislators called for a ban
on plastic and rubber bullets. The new regulations allow officers
and specially trained soldiers to fire plastic bullets to stop
fleeing stone-throwers and to disperse Palestinians erecting
roadblocks.
   Also today, the Defense Ministry confirmed that Faisal Husseini,
one of the most prominent Palestine Liberation Organization
activists in the occupied lands, will soon be released from
detention. Husseini's wife, Najat, said the detention order expires
Sunday.
   Husseini has been held without trial or specific charges for most
of the past 21 months. He was last arrested in July and ordered held
in what is called ``administrative detention'' for six months.

   Long-delayed talks between the government
and opposition groups, including Solidarity, will probably begin in
early February, a government spokesman said today.
   Also today, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa met in Warsaw with
aides to prepare for talks with the government on legalizing the
union, according to Jacek Ambroziak, a Walesa aide and lawyer for
the Roman Catholic Episcopate.
   Walesa's advisers did not say who would attend their meeting with
the government, but Tadeusz Mazowiecki, one of Walesa's closest
advisers, said a meeting with government officials was likely to
take place Friday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski said broader talks
between the government and opposition groups on economic and
political freedom ``should begin in the nearest days,'' probably
Feb. 5 or 6.
   The government first proposed the broad-based talks during labor
unrest in August, but Walesa said authorities must first agree to
legalize his union, which they banned in 1982. Last week, in a
dramatic reversal, the Communist Party's Central Committee said it
would allow more than one legal trade union and opposition
participation in government bodies.
   Solidarity agreed Sunday to hold talks with the government on
legalizing the banned union. This week's talks will be a kind of
preparatory meeting, said a Walesa adviser, the Rev. Henryk
Jankowski of St. Brygida's church in Gdansk.

<BYLINE>Police Captain's Madonna Statue Sparks ^By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Two police commanders feuding over a 9-inch
statuette of the Virgin Mary on their shared desk have been put on
different shifts, but their dispute continues before a state
arbitrator.
   The antagonism has spiraled into a full-blown debate over freedom
of religion and separation of church and state.
   ``People kind of think it's silly to be arguing over such a
thing. There are a lot more important things in the world to worry
about,'' said a lieutenant on the 180-member police force who asked
not to be identified.
   The dispute between Capt. Bruce Hogan and Lt. Eugene V. Begley
started when Hogan insisted on placing the pale yellow Madonna on
the desk they shared as the Nos. 1 and 2 in command of department's
night shift in this factory town.
   The veteran officers began trading insults and jibes as the
argument escalated last fall. Hogan accused Begley of shrouding the
religious icon in newspaper whenever the commander stepped out for
lunch.
   Begley reportedly further incurred the captain's wrath when he
skirted Hogan's order not to touch the statuette under any
circumstances.
   ``I never touched it,'' Begley said Wednesday. ``I just put the
cup over it.''
   In November, Chief John F. Hollow transferred Begley to dayside
detective duties.
   On Tuesday, a state arbitrator heard Begley's claim that the
transfer has cost him $45,000 in annual pay because by working days
he can no longer accept extra assignments for traffic control on
road construction projects.
   Three more grievance hearings are scheduled through March.
   ``That statue has no place on a police captain's desk. We have
Catholics, Protestants, Jews and I'm sure a few Muslims in this
department,'' Begley said. ``Hogan has no right to push his religion
on other people. He should not be flaunting it.''
   The chief has declined to comment on the case.
   ``It should never have left the in-house stage,'' spokesman Lt.
Joseph Rowe said. ``The department certainly didn't plan to go
public with it.''

<HEAD>Aide Says Arafat Won't Seek U.S. Visa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aide to Yasser Arafat said today the PLO
leader has decided not to ask the United States for a visa to let
him address an Arab-American group.
   The president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee,
Abdeen Jabara, said this month the group had invited Arafat to speak
at its April meeting and that he had accepted.
   Nabil Shaath, one of Arafat's top political advisers, did not
explain Arafat's apparent change of heart except to say Arafat
``said he will not go on an invitation from an unofficial group.''
   The only invitation Arafat would accept to visit the United
States would be from officials in Washington, Shaath said.
   Until December, the United States refused to even talk to the
Palestine Liberation Organization. In November, Washington refused
Arafat's request for a visa, saying he endorsed terrorism. Arafat
had requested the visa so he could address the U.N. General
Assembly, and the assembly session was moved to Geneva to
accommodate Arafat.
   Last month, Arafat renounced terrorism and endorsed U.N.
resolutions recognizing Israel's right to exist, leading the United
States to open talks with PLO officials in Tunisia.
   The problem for President Bush's administration is that denying
Arafat a visa now could anger Arab leaders, but granting him one
would draw fire from Israel and groups prominent in U.S. politics
who support the Jewish state.
   Israel still refuses to deal with the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist organization, and it has bitterly criticized the U.S.
decision to talk with it.

<HEAD>Three Semiautomatic Weapons Turned in Under Post-Massacre Buy-Back
Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mayoral candidate's offer to buy back
assault weapons in the aftermath of the Stockton school massacre
yielded two AK-47s and an Uzi.
   Councilman Nate Holden on Tuesday offered to pay up to $300 for
such weapons from a $50,000 campaign fund, a plan derided as
``spitballs at battleships'' by a spokeswoman for Mayor Tom
Bradley's re-election campaign.
   Meanwhile, Police Chief Daryl Gates appeared on ABC's
``Nightline'' Wednesday night to renew his call to outlaw assault
rifles. Today, he was expected to announce plans to form a committee
to explore a 1990 gubernatorial run.
   Assault rifles became a political issue after an AK-47 was used
last week by drifter Patrick Purdy to fire more than 100 bullets
into a schoolyard. Purdy killed five students and wounded 29 others
and a teacher before killing himself.
   Holden said Wednesday the buy-back plan might stem gang slayings.
``Any Uzi or AK-47 that we can get out of the hands of our citizens
and into the hands of law enforcement, where they belong, and
destroyed, would be a step forward,'' he said.
   Bradley spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said the mayor opposes the sale
of semiautomatic rifles altogether and favors comprehensive laws
rather than a buy-back.
   Holden on Wednesday said a woman who kept the Uzi under her bed
for several years turned it in to ``get it out of her life.''
   A 16-year-old and a 23-year-old man brought unloaded AK-47s to
two police stations, police said. The teen-ager said he received the
rifle as a gift and ``just wanted to be rid of it,'' said spokesman
Lt. Fred Nixon.

   City Council has banned polystyrene foam,
joining a growing number of communities where the substance commonly
used in fast-food packaging is unwelcome.
   The ordinance, approved 4-1 Wednesday, was opposed by business
groups and generally favored by environmentalists. It takes effect
in 1990.
   City commissioners said the ban was needed to reduce the amount
of non-biodegradable waste littering streets and choking local
landfills. In addition, the substance has been identified by some as
a hazard to wildlife.
   The measure applies to coffee cups, ``clamshell'' food containers
and other polystyrene items. Non-profit food providers are exempt.
   The ban means hamburgers and other fast-food fare will come
wrapped in foil, paper or cardboard.
   Polystyrene foam food containers have been banned in Suffolk
County, N.Y., and Florida. Berkeley, Calif., has adopted a ban on
all polystyrene foam containers.

<HEAD>Theology Professors Criticize Pope, Church, for Stand on Birth Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 170 Roman Catholic
theology professors today released a declaration strongly
criticizing Pope John Paul II and the church's ban on artificial
birth control.
   The professors took aim primarily at the pontiff's exercise of
power in three areas: choosing new bishops, granting approval to
teach theology, and the pope's teachings.
   All three areas have been subjects of controversy, exemplified by
the dispute over last month's selection of Cardinal Joachim Meisner
to head the archdiocese of Cologne, West Germany, one of the most
influential church posts in Europe. Meisner was reportedly long
backed by the pope but opposed by some clerics in Cologne, who
considered him too conservative.
   ``When the pope does that which isn't part of his office, he
cannot demand obedience in the name of Catholicism,'' the
German-language statement said. ``He must expect dissent.''
   The professors who signed the declaration are based in Austria,
Switzerland, the Netherlands and West Germany. They include
well-known figures such as Hans Kueng of Tuebingen University and
Belgian theologian Edward Schillebeeckx, as well as many other
prominent teachers.
   Another signer was feminist theologian Catharina Halke of
Nijmegen's Catholic University in the Netherlands.
   ``There are professors ranging from the left to the right,'' said
Dietmar Mieth of Tuebingen University, a spokesman for the group.
``They represent a cross section of theology professors in the four
countries.''
   Both priests and lay teachers signed the seven-page document,
Mieth told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   At the Vatican, spokesman Joaquin Navarro said: ``I think we are
talking of a local matter and I know that today the German bishops
will make known their thoughts on this point of view.''
   ``I can also say that some people who signed have withdrawn their
support of the document,'' Navarro added, without providing any
names.
   The theologians' declaration complained that the pope recently
has linked the church's teachings on birth control too closely to
fundamental articles of faith, such as the holiness of God.
   It said the link was made so strong that those who criticize the
church's ban on artificial birth control are confronted with
accusations they are ``attacking the fundamental pillars of
Christian teaching.''
   ``The concept of New Testament truth and Jesus' teaching about
salvation are enlisted by the pope to represent a specific teaching
that cannot be justified either in Holy Scripture or in the
traditions of the church,'' the theology teachers said.
   The statement, which the group called the Cologne Declaration,
complained about a rejection of ``theological argumentation'' and
``a neglect of the laity in the church.'' It complained of an
``antagonism from above, which heightens the conflicts in the church
by means of rigid discipline.''
   The Rev. Friedhelm Hengsbach, a professor at the St. Georgen
theology seminary in Frankfurt, said: ``I don't think the Vatican
will be very pleased.''
   Hengsbach, one of the authors of the Cologne Declaration, told
The Associated Press, ``The pope can't expect that people will just
keep saying `yes, yes.''' A spokesman for West Germany's bishops
said they would respond to the declaration after studying it.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Hancock, one of the nation's biggest private
health insurers, will offer coverage for a not-yet-approved drug
treatment that is thought to prevent a deadly form of pneumonia in
AIDS patients.
   John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. announced the decision
Monday after a three-month review.
   The drug therapy is aerosolized pentamadine. The Food and Drug
Administration has not cleared it for preventive use as an aerosol.
   But many doctors and AIDS patients say biweekly doses prevent
pneumocystis carinii peneumonia. The infection kills 80 percent of
people with AIDS.
   The annual cost of the treatment is about $4,200 at one Boston
clinic.
   AIDS activists picketed Hancock offices in October to urge the
insurer to cover the costs of aerosolized pentamadine. Hancock
spokeswoman Mary Gallagher said the demonstrations had no influence
on the decision.
   She said Hancock will pay for the treaments if a doctor certifies
that the patient is infected with the AIDS virus and has signs of
immune-system deterioration.

   The top federal savings and loan regulator said
today that unless Congress and the administration come up with more
money to resolve the industry's crisis, his agency may have to leave
hundreds of insolvent institutions open.
   ``The legislative failure to provide additional resources in a
timely fashion would place the (Federal Home Loan) Bank Board in a
position where there is no other option but to cease case
resolutions,'' M. Danny Wall, chairman of the bank board, told the
House Budget Committee.
   The bank board last year spent $38 billion to close insolvent
institutions or merge them with healthier partners.
   Wall estimated that insolvent savings and loans are losing $2.5
billion a year. The bank board has estimated it would cost $45
billion to $50 billion to clean up the industry. Private estimates
run to $100 billion or more.
   Wall said the bank board will provide an updated cost estimate,
possibly next week.
   He said to ``permit weak institutions to continue to
deteriorate...would ultimately increase the cost of resolution.''
   Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, said
``this crisis is a major economic and budgetary threat. It threatens
the future of the housing finance system.''
   The committee session came one day after the Bush administration
floated a trial balloon suggesting that depositors pay to resolve
the savings and loan problem. Congress wasted little time sticking a
pin into the balloon.
   Bush's Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, said Wednesday his
staff is looking into a variety of revenue-raising options,
including a proposal to charge depositors in banks, S&amp;Ls and credit
unions a 25-cent fee for every $100 in their accounts.
   Bush, in an interview, stressed that he hasn't made any
decisions, but he said, ``That is one option.''
   The trial balloon stirred a furor on Capitol Hill where Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., predicted, ``It's going to be blown out of
the water.'' Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, said through an aide, ``There
is not a member of the (banking) committee who would vote for it.''
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. which insures commerical banks, said Wednesday that he opposes
any plan that would stick banks with the cost of the S&amp;L cleanup.
   ``In general we have said it is unfair to have the banking system
pay for the errors of the S&amp;L industry, but we have always
recognized that it's a possibility,'' he said.
   Last year, federal regulators pledged more than $38 billion to
close 205 insolvent S&amp;Ls. More than 350 other insolvent institutions
remain open and billions of dollars more will be required.
   The Washington Post reported today that a forthcoming
congressional study will criticize some of the nation's largest
accounting firms for failing to uncover fraud and mismanagement at
S&amp;Ls.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
found that a dozen failed S&amp;Ls were given ``clean audits'' _ meaning
no problems were found _ shortly before they went under, the
newspaper said.
   So far, no single proposal for bailing out the industry has
gained widespread support.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a senior member of the House Banking
Committee, said the administration's decision to float the deposit
fee plan ``underscores how bad all the alternatives are.''
   ``The nature of the solutions is they are going to be
uncomfortable. ... Our choices are potentially increasing taxes,
potentially increasing the budget deficit or some sort of deposit
insurance premium increase,'' he said.
   One option under Treasury scrutiny is a user fee paid by mortgage
borrowers. Other choices involve various ways to borrow the money,
either on or off budget, with the Treasury paying the interest.
   A variation strongly opposed by S&amp;L lobby groups calls for the
Treasury to issue bonds whose principal would be covered by the
industry-owned, regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Only the annual
interest payments by the Treasury would count toward the budget
deficit.
   Others say putting all of the S&amp;L spending on-budget would be the
cheapest alternative in the long run, but that would greatly
complicate the Bush administration's efforts to bring the 1990
budget deficit under the $100 billion Gramm-Rudman limit.
   Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr., R-Ohio, a member of the budget
panel, advocates putting S&amp;L spending on-budget, but exempting it
from the Gramm-Rudman limits. He argues that S&amp;Ls costs already
exist as a federal liability and therefore shouldn't count as new
spending.
   Meanwhile, White House chief of staff John Sununu maintained that
a deposit insurance fee is not a tax and wouldn't violate Bush's
``Read my lips: no new taxes'' pledge. Sununu called it ``an
adjustment upward of the current premium structure.''

television documentary blaming the late Emperor Hirohito for the
attack on Pearl Harbor contained serious mistakes.
   The British documentary, titled ``Hirohito: Behind the Myth,''
charges that the emperor knew in detail about Japanese plans during
World War II and could have called off the attack on U.S. forces at
Pearl Harbor that launched Japan's war against the United States.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yoshifumi Matsuda, said the
program, produced by the British Broadcasting Corp., is ``unfair''
and ignores evidence that Hirohito tried to stop Japan from going to
war.
   ``It's not a bad film as a drama, but it is a prejudiced film as
a documentary, and a poor film as an academic work,'' Matsuda said.
   Hirohito died Jan. 7 from intestinal cancer at age 87.
   His wartime role has never been fully addressed in Japan and
remains a taboo topic for many Japanese.
   The television program, shown in Britain on Tuesday, was made by
Edward Behr, a Paris-based journalist.
   In the program, he challenges the image of Hirohito as a
figurehead who reluctantly went along with the military's war plans.
He quotes a diary kept during World War II by the Lord Privy Seal,
Koichi Kido, as saying Hirohito ``was smiling broadly and tearful
with joy'' at hearing the news of Japanese conquests in Southeast
Asia.
   ``That is entirely wrong,'' Matsuda said. He said the Foreign
Ministry had examined the diary and other records, and ``on that
day, there was some conversation between the emperor and Mr. Kido,
but the one who cried was Kido himself, not the emperor.''
   ``I don't know what translation he (Behr) used, but there are
many of those sorts of misunderstandings, wrong interpretations and
so forth'' in the program, the Ministry spokesman said.
   ``This film deals with history in an unfair manner in the sense
that it picks up documents and commentary which agree with his view
and he ignores all other evidence to the contrary,'' Matsuda said.
``It ignores evidence that the late emperor privately tried very
hard to prevent the war.''
   The BBC has sold the documentary for broadcast to television
stations in Australia, Austria, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, South
Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United States.
   Matsuda said Japanese television stations would be free to
broadcast the program. However, an official at the Japan
Broadcasting Corp., which often uses BBC programs, said it had no
such plans.

   The top federal savings and loan regulator said
today that unless Congress and the administration come up with more
money to resolve the industry's crisis, his agency may have to leave
hundreds of insolvent institutions open.
   ``The legislative failure to provide additional resources in a
timely fashion would place the (Federal Home Loan) Bank Board in a
position where there is no other option but to cease case
resolutions,'' M. Danny Wall, chairman of the bank board, told the
House Budget Committee.
   The bank board last year spent $38 billion to close insolvent
institutions or merge them with healthier partners.
   Wall estimated that insolvent savings and loans are losing $2.5
billion a year. The bank board has estimated it would cost $45
billion to $50 billion to clean up the industry. Private estimates
run to $100 billion or more.
   Wall said the bank board will provide an updated cost estimate,
possibly next week.
   He said to ``permit weak institutions to continue to
deteriorate...would ultimately increase the cost of resolution.''
   Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, said
``this crisis is a major economic and budgetary threat. It threatens
the future of the housing finance system.''
   The committee session came one day after the Bush administration
floated a trial balloon suggesting that depositors pay to resolve
the savings and loan problem. Congress wasted little time sticking a
pin into the balloon.
   Bush's Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, said Wednesday his
staff is looking into a variety of revenue-raising options,
including a proposal to charge depositors in banks, S&amp;Ls and credit
unions a 25-cent fee for every $100 in their accounts.
   Bush, in an interview, stressed that he hasn't made any
decisions, but he said, ``That is one option.''
   The trial balloon stirred a furor on Capitol Hill where Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., predicted, ``It's going to be blown out of
the water.'' Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, said through an aide, ``There
is not a member of the (banking) committee who would vote for it.''
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. which insures commerical banks, said Wednesday that he opposes
any plan that would stick banks with the cost of the S&amp;L cleanup.
   ``In general we have said it is unfair to have the banking system
pay for the errors of the S&amp;L industry, but we have always
recognized that it's a possibility,'' he said.
   Last year, federal regulators pledged more than $38 billion to
close 205 insolvent S&amp;Ls. More than 350 other insolvent institutions
remain open and billions of dollars more will be required.
   The Washington Post reported today that a forthcoming
congressional study will criticize some of the nation's largest
accounting firms for failing to uncover fraud and mismanagement at
S&amp;Ls.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
found that a dozen failed S&amp;Ls were given ``clean audits'' _ meaning
no problems were found _ shortly before they went under, the
newspaper said.
   So far, no single proposal for bailing out the industry has
gained widespread support.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, a senior member of the House Banking
Committee, said the administration's decision to float the deposit
fee plan ``underscores how bad all the alternatives are.''
   ``The nature of the solutions is they are going to be
uncomfortable. ... Our choices are potentially increasing taxes,
potentially increasing the budget deficit or some sort of deposit
insurance premium increase,'' he said.
   One option under Treasury scrutiny is a user fee paid by mortgage
borrowers. Other choices involve various ways to borrow the money,
either on or off budget, with the Treasury paying the interest.
   A variation strongly opposed by S&amp;L lobby groups calls for the
Treasury to issue bonds whose principal would be covered by the
industry-owned, regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Only the annual
interest payments by the Treasury would count toward the budget
deficit.
   Others say putting all of the S&amp;L spending on-budget would be the
cheapest alternative in the long run, but that would greatly
complicate the Bush administration's efforts to bring the 1990
budget deficit under the $100 billion Gramm-Rudman limit.
   Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr., R-Ohio, a member of the budget
panel, advocates putting S&amp;L spending on-budget, but exempting it
from the Gramm-Rudman limits. He argues that S&amp;Ls costs already
exist as a federal liability and therefore shouldn't count as new
spending.
   Meanwhile, White House chief of staff John Sununu maintained that
a deposit insurance fee is not a tax and wouldn't violate Bush's
``Read my lips: no new taxes'' pledge. Sununu called it ``an
adjustment upward of the current premium structure.''

   Sinhalese militants killed at least 37
people in central and southern Sri Lanka over the past 24 hours,
including an opposition candidate in next month's national
elections, police said today.
   Seven more people were found shot to death, but authorities said
they didn't know if the slayings were politically motivated. Police
shot to death another man believed to be a militant.
   The government placed troops on alert across the nation, and the
Defense Ministry warned militants against further attempts to
disrupt the Feb. 15 elections.
   Police blamed most of the killings on the radical Sinhalese
People's Liberation Front, which has vowed to disrupt the elections
and opposes past government efforts to make peace with Tamil rebels.
   Victims included Nissanka Dharmatilleke, the 10th opposition
candidate to be killed since nominations for the national elections
closed 20 days ago.
   Military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity declined
to say who might have killed the 42-year-old Dharmatilleke.
   He belonged to the United Socialist Alliance, a leftist coalition
whose candidate, Ossie Abeyegoonesekera, finished a distant third in
last month's presidential election.
   Six of the 10 slain candidates belonged to the alliance. The
others belonged to the opposition Sri Lanka Freedom Party led by
Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
   Dharmatilleke's father, two brothers and two political supporters
also were killed in the attack late Wednesday at Katugastotta, 60
miles northeast of Colombo, the capital.
   All the victims were Sinhalese, Sri Lanka's majority ethnic group.
   In another attack Wednesday night, seven Sinhalese were shot to
death at Kadugannawa, five miles southeast of Katugastotta, but
military officials said they did not know if the killings were
politically motivated.
   Police said 31 people, all Sinhalese, were killed by militants in
18 separate incidents in southern and eastern cities. They did not
give details.
   A man killed in police firing in southern Sri Lanka late
Wednesday was identified as J.L. Siripala, a suspected militant,
officials said.
   Opposition parties have blamed the candidates' killings on
supporters of the United National Party headed by Ranasinghe
Premadasa, Sri Lanka's new president. Members of the governing party
have denied the charge and blamed the People's Liberation Front.
   The front has denied responsibility for the latest killings.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's population of 16
million people and dominate the political and military
establishments. Tamils make up 18 percent of the population.
   A Tamil separatist war in northern and eastern Sri Lanka has
prompted a Sinhalese backlash. The People's Liberation Front
initially targeted the United National Party, saying Premadasa's
predecessor, President Junius R. Jayewardene, had gone too far in
his peacemaking efforts with the Tamils.

   A group of liberals in and out of Congress
today denounced former President Reagan for a legacy of ``neglected
needs'' and said it will press President Bush to do better.
   ``We don't need to play on their turf. If we play on their turf,
we lose,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said at a news conference at
which the Democracy Project, a New York-based think tank, released a
600-page blueprint for liberal action.
   ``We are going to be more than kind and gentle; we are going to
be bold and imaginative,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   In the 38-chapter broadside it issued, the Democracy Project
said, ``We now see the difference between good acts and good acting
and how popularity is not the same as problem solving.''
   In an introduction to the volume, Mark Green, president of the
project, said both ``opportunity and peril'' confront the 41st
president and the 101st Congress.
   ``But diverting America from responding well are the multiple
crises Ronald Reagan has bequeathed us,'' he said. ``It's hard to
ignore his accumulation of neglected needs.''
   The document also criticized Bush for failing to deal in his
campaign with issues ranging from the need for public housing to the
plight of nuclear weapons production plants.
   ``Stressing flags and furloughs may have been a winning political
formula, but it will now take a microscope to detect Bush's mandate
for change,'' Green wrote.
   The critique did not spare the Democrats and their presidential
nominee either.
   ``Clearly Reagan and Bush have a very few understandable themes,
involving less taxes and government, while Democrats seem to flit
from one framework and slogan to another,'' it said. ``Michael
Dukakis tried to define himself as the sum of his position papers,
but it still didn't add up to a coherent whole.'
   The group said Bush's call for a ``kinder, gentler nation'' along
with his pronouncements on education, ethics and the environment
``do obligate him to pursue more compassionate solutions. Even
`liberal' solutions.''
   Among specific recommendations were public financing of Senate
and House races, requiring large employers to provide health
coverage for their workers, giving up Reagan's Star Wars plan of a
space-based missile defense as a bargaining chip to obtain
reductions in nuclear weaponry, and avoiding any ``precipitous''
balancing of the budget for fear of triggering a recession.
   The document contrasts sharply with a blueprint issued Dec. 8 by
the conservative Heritage Foundation, which called for greater
reliance on private-sector health insurance, withdrawing from the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to permit faster movement on Star
Wars, and increasing the personal income tax exemption for children
to $6,500.
   Members of Congress listed as attending today's press briefing
were Sens. Wyche Fowler of Georgia and Tom Harkin of Iowa and Reps.
Byron Dorgan of North Dakota, Edward Markey of Massachusetts and
Henry Waxman of California. All are Democrats.
   ``Reaganites concluded that the best way to produce sustained
growth was to concentrate on stimulating well-off investors to save,
invest and produce more,'' the group's analysis said. ``This
emphasis, however, conveniently led to a flood of corporate
giveaways and upscale tax breaks. The results? Savings and
investment fell after enactment of Reagan's tax budget program in
1981, and the distribution of wealth predictably worsened.''
   It also said that ``Reagan administration family policies have
been pro-life, pre-birth; but once the fetus became an infant, the
government ran away from home.''
   ``It's an odd priority to think that large corporations need tax
incentives to be productive but that you ruin a child if you give
him or her a hot lunch,'' the critique said.
   In U.S.-Soviet relations, the document said, Reagan ``deserves
praise for finally appreciating the need to trade proposals rather
than insults,'' but failed to formulate a plan for responding to new
Soviet initiatives.
   In the field of government ethics, it said, the former president
``never once publicly reproached his dozens of derelict appointees.''

<TEXT>
   Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who confounded
political experts in 1985 by winning statewide office in the
conservative South, opened a bid today to become the nation's first
elected black governor.
   ``Forty years ago, working my way through college and law school
as a waiter and busboy, I never dreamed I would have the opportunity
to run for governor of Virginia,'' the 58-year-old Democrat told
hundreds of cheering supporters.
   Wilder announced a ``three for Virginia'' plan _ permanent tax
relief, a fight against drugs and drug-related crime, and creation
of jobs and housing for rural Virginians.
   Wilder has no opposition for the Democratic nomination, which
will be decided at the party convention in June. State Sen. Daniel
W. Bird Jr. pulled out of the race two days ago, citing low
fund-raising.
   On the Republican side, former Sen. Paul Trible has announced for
governor and is expected to face former Virginia Attorney General
Marshall Coleman for the nomination.
   Louisiana had a black governor during Reconstruction, but he was
not elected; Lt. Gov. Pinckney Pinchback became acting governor in
1872-73 after Gov. Henry Warmoth was removed from office.
   In 1985, Wilder's nomination for lieutenant governor drew
predictions of doom for the party ticket in Virginia, which is 82
percent white.
   But Wilder and his running mate, Gerald L. Baliles, won, thanks
in part to the popularity of outgoing Gov. Charles S. Robb, now a
U.S. senator. Wilder received 44 percent of the white vote and 97
percent of the black vote.
   Baliles is barred by the state constitution from seeking a second
consecutive term.
   As a state senator from Richmond in the 1970s, Wilder was seen as
a left-of-center oddity in a body dominated by conservative whites.
   Wilder's views and his rhetoric have moderated, however. He
refused to use race as an issue in the 1985 campaign and has been a
generally loyal, if sometimes fretful, team player as lieutenant
governor.
   In his biggest rift with Baliles, he complained about a
half-penny sales tax increase passed in 1986. But Wilder's criticism
came after the session and angered the governor, who wanted to know
why Wilder did not speak up sooner.

<HEAD>Italian Court Reportedly Concludes Banker Was Murdered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Milan court has concluded that banker Roberto
Calvi, whose body was found hanging from a London bridge in 1982
after his Banco Ambrosiano collapsed, was murdered, newspapers
reported today.
   A coroner's jury in London in June 1983 left unresolved the
question of whether Calvi hanged himself, perhaps driven to suicide
by his inability to account for $1.4 billion in loans and interest,
or whether he was murdered to stop him from talking about a
financial scandal reaching into the Vatican.
   Calvi was popularly known as ``God's banker'' because of his
close ties with the Vatican.
   The action in the Milan civil court was brought by Calvi's widow,
Clara, who is trying to collect on a $3 million life insurance
policy.
   Calvi was insured by Assicurazioni Generali, Italy's largest
insurance company. A spokesman, Armando Zimolo, said the policy
ruled out payment in case of suicide. The company may appeal today's
decision.
   According to the newspaper accounts, the court reached its
conclusion on the basis of an autopsy and a reconstruction of what
the court believed happened the night of June 17, 1982, at
Blackfriars Bridge in London.
   Court officials could not be reached for comment.
   Calvi was found twisting in the wind from scaffolding under the
bridge. His suit pockets were loaded with 11 pounds of bricks and a
brick was stuffed down the front of his pants.
   The Vatican bank was the largest shareholder of Banco Ambrosiano.
   Banco Ambrosiano collapsed following its failure to collect $1.4
billion in Vatican bank-assured loans made to 10 dummy companies in
Latin America.

   A 73-year-old man was found dead in a
garbage can on his front porch, where police believe he had been
stuck for three days.
   Robert Hamm waved to a mailman and a newspaper carrier while in
the trash can earlier this week but may have been too weak to alert
them that he was stuck, police said Wednesday.
   ``I would imagine he was probably trying to signal something, but
his expression or whatever wasn't enough to get them to do anything
about it,'' Sgt. R.J. Liepins said. ``They all feel very bad.''
   The 11-year-old newspaper carrier, who had waved back to Hamm on
Monday, discovered him on Wednesday.
   Hamm, who was of medium height and build, apparently fell
backward into the standard-size metal trash can on his enclosed
porch and couldn't get out, Liepins said. He was found in the can up
to his armpits, with his legs sticking out.
   On Tuesday, the mailman, whose name was unavailable, saw Hamm in
the can from outside the porch and saw his hand move, Liepins said.
``He thought something was funny ... but he just let it pass,''
Liepins said.

<TEXT>
   Five ranch workers have been indicted in the
slayings of more than 40 wild horses and burros in Nevada, and
officials said the investigation continues into the deaths of 500
more animals.
   The men were charged with violating the federal Wild and Free
Roaming Horse and Burro Act, Assistant U.S. attorney Will Mattly
said Wednesday. Each count carries up to a year in prison and a
$2,000 fine.
   Mattly said the slayings occurred on federal land 150 miles
northeast of Reno where the remains of more than 500 mustangs have
been found since August.
   Many of the animals had been shot, although others may have died
of natural causes, officials said. Some of the animals may have been
dead for years.
   Mattly gave no motive for the killings, and the charges,
contained in an indictment handed up Tuesday, did not specify how
the animals died.
   Indicted were David Morehead and Shannon Brennan of Lovelock,
cousins Eugene John Thacker of Winnemucca and David Thacker, and
Ronald Emory Hage of Cosgrave. They were taken into custody Tuesday
and Wednesday.
   David Thacker's father, John, said, ``I don't believe any of them
are guilty.'' Morehead's attorney, Don Hill, said his client is
innocent as well.
   Maxine Shane, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management, said the agency considered the case to be far from over.
   ``It is definitely a continuing investigation,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Communist authorities in Czechoslovakia
have released six human rights activists arrested 10 days ago at a
peaceful rally in central Prague, an emigre source reported today.
   But banned playwright Vaclav Havel and two other activists remain
in custody and, like the six who were released Wednesday in Prague,
face trial on charges of disturbing the peace and hooliganism, said
the London-based Palach Press, which monitors events in
Czechoslovakia.
   Havel and 15 other activists were detained on Jan. 16 after eight
of them tried to lay flowers in central Wenceslas Square in memory
of Jan Palach, a student who burned himself to death there 20 years
ago. Palach was protesting the August 1968 Soviet-led invastion that
crushed ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   According to the emigre source, the nine accused of disturbing
the peace and hooliganism face a maximum of two years in prison if
convicted.
   The six released were identified as Dana Nemcova and Sasha
Vondra, spokesmen for the Charter 77 human rights group, Ms.
Nemcova's son David Nemec and Petr Placak, both of the Czech
Children group, Stanislav Penc of the John Lennon Peace Club and
Jana Sternova, also a senior Charter 77 member.
   Besides Havel, those in detention are Jana Petrova of the
Independent Peace Association and Otakar Veverka of the John Lennon
Peace Club. Havel, 52, has spent a total of four years in prison for
his human rights activities.

   Experts from OPEC and independent oil-producing

   Both sides gathered at a hall this morning in the City, London's

unsuccessful _ meeting took place last April.
   The secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Subroto, told reporters Wednesday that the two sides
``will exchange information'' today and plan to issue a joint
statement afterward.
   The non-OPEC group issued a communique Wednesday saying: ``The
(non-OPEC) delegates unanimously share the desire to see the oil
market stabilize, an issue they consider of importance to both
consumers and producers of oil.''
   A senior OPEC source said he was hopeful an agreement could be
reached for independent producers to cut their production, although
he said that wasn't likely soon.
   ``Our unity is stronger now. Prices have strengthened and we are
ready'' for a cooperative agreement, said the OPEC source, who
requested anonymity.
   ``This is the first step in a step-by-step move'' to push up oil
prices, the source added.
   In April, six non-OPEC producers met with representatives from
six of OPEC's 13 members and suggested they jointly cut their
exports by 5 percent. OPEC, then more divided, rejected that
proposal.
   This time, some of the seven attending non-OPEC producers might
offer to cut their collective production by 5 percent, without
asking for reciprocal cuts from OPEC, non-OPEC sources said this
week.
   They likely would want reassurances from OPEC that in that event,
the cartel would not increase its own production.
   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, was $16.76 a barrel in afternoon trading
today, up 16 cents from late Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate, the
U.S. benchmark crude oil, rose 25 cents to $18.37 a barrel today in
late-morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The non-OPEC communique said representatives of Angola, China,
Colombia, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, and Oman met with observers from
the Soviet Union, Norway, the Yemen Arab Republic and the Canadian
province of Alberta and the states of Alaska and Texas.
   OPEC participants feel that if all goes well this week, the next
step would be to call a meeting of the ministers of the six members
of the OPEC contact group with ministers from the participating
non-OPEC countries, the source said.
   That is likely to take place in late March to coincide with an
OPEC committee meeting scheduled for March 29 in Vienna, the source
said.
   Holding such a meeting might be useful to help support oil prices
during the second quarter, when demand traditionally slackens and
prices weaken.
   OPEC members agreed in November to limit their production to 18.5
million barrels a day in an effort to boost prices to a targeted $18
a barrel. The agreement was effective Jan. 1.
   OPEC members are producing an estimated 19.5 million barrels a
day, down as much as 3.5 million barrels a day from the fourth
quarter. That has helped oil prices recover from about $12 a barrel
in December.
   In their previous accord, OPEC members agreed to limit production
to 15.06 million barrels a day.
   The next full OPEC ministerial meeting is scheduled for June.
   The other OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar, Iran,
Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.

   A Korean-American businessman charged in a
plot to export nerve gas had contacts at U.S. military bases and
possessed Army ``fact sheets'' available only to authorized defense
contractors, a prosecutor said today.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer raised the issues after an
attorney for the Short Hills businessman, Juwhan Yun, asked a judge
to release his client on bail.
   Yun, 48, had also asked Bendix Technologies about buying a
chemical agent that could be used to mask the presence of sarin, the
deadly nerve gas that the government accuses him of trying to
acquire, said Ms. Singer.
   Correspondence found in his possession ``does show that he has
contacts with persons at U.S. military bases,'' she told U.S.
District Judge H. Lee Sarokin. After the hearing, Ms. Singer
declined to elaborate on her statement.
   She also told the judge Yun was not an authorized defense
contractor but had fact sheets provided by the Army only to
contractors on an approved distribution list.
   Last week, Ms. Singer disclosed that investigators searching
Yun's Summit business, Komex International Corp., found national
security documents marked secret and confidential.
   Today, she said those papers amount to 30 pages in English and
100 pages in Korean, which indicates some documents were jointly
classified by the U.S. and South Korean governments.
   ``He has a source of documents somewhere,'' said the prosecutor.
She said an espionage charge could be added to the indictment, which
charged Yun with conspiring to violate federal controls on arms
exports.
   Ms. Singer repeated that Yun boasted of high-level contacts with
civilian and military officials of foreign governments including
South Korea, the People's Republic of China and Yugoslavia.
   Yun ``would spend much money entertaining them when they came to
this country,'' she said.
   Sarokin asked the government for further transcripts of Yun's
dealings with an undercover customs agent posing as an arms dealer
before ruling on Yun's bail request. He did not indicate when he
would rule.
   A magistrate had set bail at $2 million, which Yun met through
friends posting their properties, but withdrew it last Friday after
Ms. Singer revealed Yun's alleged possession of the classified
documents.
   Yun's attorney, Stephen Dratch, argued it was unfair to hold Yun
on the basis of those documents without charging him for having them.
   Yun was arrested Jan. 12 at a meeting with an undercover agent.
The government said he conspired with London businessman Charles
Caplan to acquire the gas for possible export to Iran. Caplan was
also indicted and is a fugitive.

   Soviet and Afghan troops shelled both
ends of a major tunnel north of Afghanistan's capital in raids that
killed hundreds of civilians, Western diplomats said today.
   The diplomats, who demanded anonymity, quoted reports from Kabul
as saying that ``after bombing of north and south ends of Salang
tunnel, Soviet and Afghan artillery obliterated all dwellings and
villages south of the tunnel.''
   They quoted Afghan sources, including an eyewitnesss report, as
saying the raids occurred Monday at the Salang tunnel on the main
highway, which connects Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.
   ``Soviet forces and Afghan Special Guard committed a major
atrocity in Salang area on Monday,'' the diplomats said.
``Reportedly, hundreds of civilians were killed.''
   ``According to eyewitnesses, no dwellings remain,'' they said.
   A dispatch received from Western diplomats in Kabul said
witnesses reported seeing ``Soviet tanks rolling over dead bodies of
victims of Salang road.''
   The dispatch said the account of destruction of all dwellings
came from three separate sources, including one diplomat who is an
outspoken defender of Afghan President Najib.
   Also today, Afghanistan's state-run Radio Kabul said 206
guerrillas were killed in two days of fighting in the eastern
province of Parwan. It said 109 more rebels were killed in a clash
in the southeastern city of Kandahar today.
   The radio, monitored in Islamabad, gave no other details.
   The report came the same day Moslem insurgents said they had
stepped up attacks on Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city,
because the Soviets were airlifting tons of arms and ammunition to
prop up government forces there.
   The Afghan News Agency, run by the hard-line Hezb-i-Islami
guerrilla group, said Soviet aircraft were bombarding rebel
positions around the city.
   ``The situation in Kandahar is speedily taking a turn for the
worse and the Russian planeloads of sophisticated armaments are on
the increase,'' it said.
   The news agency claimed the airlift was meant to prevent the fall
of the city to the guerrillas, or ``holy warriors,'' before Feb. 15,
the deadline for the Red Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   ``The Afghan mujahedeen around Kandahar have escalated their
combined attacks on the airport ... with a view to blocking the sole
Soviet military supply line so as to tighten the economic blockade
of the city,'' it reported.
   Other guerrilla sources claimed rebels downed two helicopters
with anti-aircraft guns Jan. 19 during an attack on Kandahar's
airport.
   There was no independent confirmation of that action, but Western
diplomats and travelers have backed up reports of increased fighting
around the city, which remains under communist control.
   Radio Kabul on Wednesday reported the killing of more than 700
rebels in recent fighting. Non-communist observers usually describe
such high casualty counts as exaggerated.
   Western diplomats in Islamabad claim Radio Kabul has broadcast
several false reports of communist victories to boost the morale of
government forces who the diplomats say are increasingly nervous at
the prospect of facing the well-armed mujahedeen alone after the
Soviets leave.
   The radio repeatedly has broadcast reports of killings of
American, Pakistani and other ``foreign advisers'' in Afghanistan.
   Washington and Islamabad, who back the rebels, have denied having
anyone but embassy staff in Afghanistan.
   Moscow agreed in last year's U.N.-sponsored accord to end its
nine-year military involvement in the Afghan war by Feb. 15.
   The ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan seized power
in a 1978 military coup. Soviet forces intervened in December 1979
to replace one pro-Moscow government with another and about 115,000
Red Arny troops stayed on to help it fight a growing insurgency.
   Western diplomats say the final phase of the pullout is in full
swing. They have predicted that most Soviet combat units will be out
of the country by the end of January. Half had left by Aug. 15.

<TEXT>
   President Bush called Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir for ``a very general discussion,'' but no plans were
made for the two to meet, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
today.
   Fitzwater said Bush's call to Shamir on Wednesday ``was one of a
series of conversations'' the president has been having by telephone
this week with world figures who had sent congratulatory messages on
his inauguration.
   ``They did discuss the idea that they'd both like to visit each
others' countries,'' the spokesman said. But ``no dates were set and
no specific commitments were made.''
   Fitzwater also said the new administration opposes direct talks
between top U.S. officials and Yasser Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``We believe it would be premature at this time'' for Arafat to
meet with Secretary of State James A. Baker III or with Bush, the
spokesman said.
   The U.S. government authorized State Department diplomats to have
contacts with PLO representatives in the waning days of the Reagan
administration. This came after Arafat publicly renounced terrorism
as an instrument of policy and said he accepted Israel's right to
exist.
   ``We will be watching the actions of the PLO as they undertake to
uphold their recent promises,'' Fitzwater said when asked whether
the United States would upgrade the level of contacts with the PLO.
   `` ... We are looking for a long-term commitment,'' he said,
``and we will be judging accordingly. But it's too soon at this time
to talk about those kinds of meetings.''

<HEAD>Wages Rose Average 2.6 Percent In First Year Of New Contracts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nearly 1.8 million workers in private
industry affected by collective bargaining settlements signed last
year received an average first-year pay raise of 2.6 percent, the
government said today.
   For the full term of major new contracts settled last year, wage
increases averaged 2.4 percent, the Labor Department reported.
Nearly 80 percent of the 1.79 million workers whose bargaining units
settled contracts in 1988 received a pay increase, while 2 percent
saw their wages decline and the rest say their pay stay the same.
   The Labor Department tracks wage settlements for 6 million
workers in private industry whose bargaining units have at least
1,000 members. Of that group, 1.79 million were affected by
contracts settled in 1988.
   The raises they received compared to average first-year increases
of 1.8 percent and overall average annual raises of 2.6 percent in
their prior contracts, most of which were negotiated in 1985 or 1986.
   In addition to their contractual raises, about 28 percent _
504,000 _ of the workers affected in 1988 also received some form of
lump-sum payment, generally performance or attendance bonuses. The
average contractual wage increase for those workers was 1.4 percent
both in the first year of the contract and throughout its term,
lagging behind the average pay raises for workers whose employers
did not provide lump-sum payments in addition to raises negotiated
through collective bargaining.
   The Labor Department said 38 percent, or 686,000, of the workers
affected by contracts signed last year will receive cost-of-living
adjustments under the pacts. Contracts allowing for such
adjustments, however, contained average wage increases of 1.8
percent a year compared to 2.8 percent a year in contracts without
COLA clauses. Those adjustments generally are based on the
government's Cosumer Price Index.
   Workers in manufacturing on average received a smaller percentage
increase in their wages than those in the non-manufacturing sector,
the government said. Settlements affecting 706,000 manufacturing
workers contained average pay increases of 2.2 percent in the first
year and 2.1 percent a year over the life of the contract. Wage
increases averaged 2.8 percent in the first year and 2.5 percent
annually overall for the more than 1 million workers in the
non-manufacturing sector of the economy covered by major settlements
signed in 1988.
   In all, there were 415 contracts settled last year involving
bargaining units of 1,000 or more workers. The average duration of
the new contracts was 33.3 months.

   A Cabinet minister today became
the third member of the governing National Party to quit Parliament
this week after being linked to fraud or financial misconduct.
   Manpower Minister Pietie du Plessis, a Cabinet member since 1980,
said he resigned because of controversy surrounding his personal
life and in the interest of the government and the National Party.
   Newspapers across the political spectrum, including those
supporting the National Party, said the action was believed related
to a probe of property transactions involving du Plessis' department
that may have benefitted his son.
   On Wednesday, Leon de Beer, the National Party's member of
Parliament for the Johannesburg district of Hillbrow, resigned. De
Beer was convicted last year of electoral fraud and faces two years
in jail if his appeal fails.
   Also resigning this week was Peet de Pontes, Parliament member
from East London. An inquiry commission has recommended prosecutors
consider charging him with fraud and perjury in connection with
efforts to smuggle an Italian drug financier into one of South
Africa's black homelands.
   The government also has been embarrassed by disclosures made
during a continuing inquiry into the affairs of millionaire
businessman Albert Vermass, who has entertained senior Cabinet
ministers and government banking officials at his home and private
game farm.
   Vermass is under investigation for possible involvement in
improper foreign exchange transations. Business Day, a Johannesburg
newspaper, reported today that Vermass did not file income tax
returns from 1974 through 1984.
   The three vacated Parliament seats could go to the opposition if
by-elections are held soon. Du Plessis' rural Transvaal Province
district is considered vulnerable to a challenge by the far-right
Conservative Party, while liberal candidates would be favored to win
in Hillbrow and East London.
   The National Party holds 133 of the 178 seats in Parliament's
white chamber.
   The Cape Times, a Cape Town newspaper, suggested today the
resignations may have been ordered by President P.W. Botha, who is
recuperating from a stroke.
   ``Mr. Botha obviously does not want to be remembered as the head
of state presiding over the most corrupt administration in National
Party history,'' the newspaper said in an editorial. ``To ensure
against that possibility, he must not allow vested party interests
to get in the way of full disclosure.''

   A private group today proposed elaborate
measures to seal the southern border against illegal immigrants but
derided government plans for a car-blocking ditch south of San Diego
as ``too little too late.''
   The Federation for American Immigration Reform proposed
installing stronger and higher metal fences, concrete barriers and
electronic surveillance equipment along the 200 miles of the Mexican
border where most illegal immigration occurs.
   ``If we are to regain control of the southern border, we will
have to begin to deter illegal entry rather than merely apprehend
those hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who cross our northern
and southern land borders every year,'' said the report. ``Locking
uninvited gate crashers out ... is just good common sense.''
   The report was issued a day after the Border Patrol announced
plans to build a 5-foot-deep, 4-mile-long ditch in an attempt to
stop drug smugglers from driving across a flat desert from Mexico to
San Diego.
   The ditch, which Associate Attorney General Francis A. Keating II
likened to a ``buried Berlin Wall,'' will traverse an area east of
San Ysidro, Calif., that is a major drug smuggling route.
   But Patrick Burns, assistant director of FAIR, said ``the
drainage ditch is too little too late if it is to be taken seriously
as a method of deterring illegal entry.''
   Mike Gregg, a Border Patrol spokesman in San Diego, said the
ditch, a joint project between INS and the International Boundary
and Water Commission, would cost an estimated $2 million.
   Gregg said the ditch would also serve to drain runoff that has
vexed residents on both sides of the border. Mexican authorities
have also expressed interest in installing the ditch to solve the
drainage problem, he said.
   FAIR estimated the cost of its more ambitious proposal at $200
million.
   Burns' group proposed charging a $2 user fee for every person who
crosses the border to finance construction of better fences and
stepped-up border patrols.
   ``Where a fence exists at all, it often lies torn and tattered,''
the report said. ``Gaping holes invite illegal entry'' and efforts
to patch them ``amount to bailing water in a sinking ship.''
   The non-partisan organization's advisory committee includes
former Attorney General William French Smith, ex-Sen. Walter D.
Huddleston, D-Ky., and former Colo. Gov. Richard Lamm. It issued its
recommendations in a report entitled ``Ten Steps to Securing
America's Borders.''
   The flood of illegal immigrants, reflected by the increase of
border arrests from 202,111 in 1970 to 1.9 million three years ago,
can't be stopped unless the border is more secure, the group said.
   ``Everyone has the right to lock his own back door. Those who
ignore the lock and enter without permission are guilty of breaking
and entering. This is the transgression of the illegal alien,'' it
said.
   ``We must recognize that stopping illegal entry will involve
deterrence, detection, apprehension, and repatriation.''
   Burns said the Border Patrol's planned ditch would be an obstacle
only to a fraction of illegal immigrants entering southern
California.
   ``There is a serious problem at San Diego of which a very, very
small component is high-speed drive-throughs,'' he said.
   Burns noted that illegal aliens account for 20 percent of the
felony arrests in San Diego County.
   The ditch won't put a dent in the cross-border drug traffic
either, because ``they have hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
narcotics being smuggled through the port of entry,'' he said.
   San Ysidro, with more than 50 million crossings annually, is the
world's busiest port of entry, according to the report.
   For this region, the report proposes building a 20-mile-long,
12-foot sunken concrete retaining wall topped by an eight-foot metal
fence. The earth would be graded so that the concrete wall would be
built into the ground.
   ``Illegal aliens would face nothing less than a smooth vertical
wall which would be virtually impossible to scale without a ladder.''
   The government's proposed ditch was termed a potential deathtrap
by one Mexican-American leader.
   ``If it's an obstacle that could injure someone, then we cannot
tolerate it,'' Jess Haro, president of San Diego's Chicano
Federation, said Wednesday. ``I'd like to believe that we are not in
the business where we are out to maim people.''
   The report also called for installing electronic ground sensors,
which transmit radio signals to base stations when they detect
movement, as well as a low-light television surveillance system for
a one-mile section on either side of San Ysidro.
   Similar sunken earth fences are proposed for El Paso, Texas,
which accounts for 20 percent of southern-border arrests.
   Concrete rails and secure metal fences are proposed for other
border areas.
   Most of the remaining 1,800 miles of the U.S.-Mexican border is
over such treacherous terrain that few people attempt to enter the
country there, the report said.

In addition, Australia allows 6,000 Indochinese to resettle in

   About 120,000 Indochinese refugees, mostly Vietnamese, have
resettled in Australia since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of liberals in and out of Congress
urged President Bush Thursday to go slow in reducing the budget
deficit and abandon the Reagan administration's ``obsession'' with
the Star Wars program of space-based missile defense.
   The Democracy Project, a self-described progressive research
group based in New York, outlined its views at a news conference at
which officers of the project were joined by Democratic members of
Congress.
   ``The risks of reducing the deficit too quickly are at least as
serious as the risks of doing nothing at all,'' said James
Galbraith, a professor of economics at the University of Texas and a
former director of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
   Any ``precipitous'' balancing of the federal budget, the group
said in its report, would run the risk of triggering a recession.
   Paul Warnke, head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in
the Carter administration, spoke for the organization on foreign
policy, saying that Bush ``has an almost unparalleled opportunity to
remove the risk of nuclear war and end the military confrontation in
Europe.''
   One of the principal obstacles standing in the way, he said, is
``the obsession that has existed with regard to strategic defense.''
But he said this obstacle ``is removing itself'' because ``neither
the technology nor the funds are there.''
   In its report the group recommended that the Bush administration
use the Star Wars plan as a bargaining chip in negotiations to
obtain reductions in nuclear weaponry, something the Reagan
administration refused to do.
   Commenting on the group's report, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
suggested that congressional Democrats should not accept Bush's
budget if it makes only minor adjustments in the Reagan budget.
   ``We don't need to play on their turf; if we play on their turf,
we lose,'' said Harkin.
   ``We are going to be more than kind and gentle; we are going to
be bold and imaginative,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   The Democracy Project report said, ``We now see the difference
between good acts and good acting and how popularity is not the same
as problem solving.''
   It said Bush failed to deal in his campaign with such issues as a
need for public housing and the problems of nuclear weapons plants.
   ``Stressing flags and furloughs may have been a winning political
formula, but it will now take a microscope to detect Bush's mandate
for change,'' said Mark Green, president of the project, in an
introduction to the book.
   The project also had some critical words for the Democrats and
their unsuccessful presidential nominee, saying, ``Clearly Reagan
and Bush have a very few understandable themes, involving less taxes
and government, while Democrats seem to flit from one framework and
slogan to another. Michael Dukakis tried to define himself as the
sum of his position papers, but it still didn't add up to a coherent
whole.''

   A Communist Party delegation from North Korea on
Thursday called for the return of a defector in exchange for two
Japanese sailors held in North Korea, a news report said.
   The issue has been a major problem between the two countries,
which has no formal diplomatic relations.
   The appeal was made by Kim Yang Kon, who heads the four-man
delegation from North Korea, according to Kyodo News Service.
Foreign news media were barred from the news conference at the
headquarters of Japan's largest opposition party, the Socialists,
which is the host of the visit.
   The defector, Min Hong Gu, has been in Japan since he stowed away
on a Japanese freighter as it left North Korea in 1983. The two
Japanese sailors were arrested after they returned to North Korea
aboard the ship.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower told a
Senate confirmation hearing today that laws should be tightened to
prevent officials ``from profiting unfairly, unethically, or
illegally or inordinately'' if they move between Pentagon and
industry jobs.
   Tower also assured the Senate Armed Services Committee that the
$763,777 he collected as a defense consultant over the past three
years would not influence actions he might take as defense secretary.
   Tower said he terminated all consulting contracts on Dec. 1, one
day after meeting with President Bush's transition staff and
learning that he was under serious consideration for the defense
post.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
expressed his concern about the perception of former consultant
heading the Defense Department.
   ``The likelihood is I will bend over backwards,'' to avoid
favoring his former associates, Tower said.
   ``Your former clients might worry,'' Nunn said.
   ``That may be true,'' Tower responded.
   Under persistent questioning from Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., Tower
said he would disqualify himself from making decisions on the Combat
Flight Inspection System, which allows airborne aircraft to check on
whether landing transmitters are working correctly, because of the
extensive lobbying he did for the program.
   But he refused to specify any other projects from which he would
disqualify himself, saying he would handle those on an ``ad hoc''
basis.
   Tower also cautioned Congress that it should write
``revolving-door'' laws ``carefully enough so that honest,
hardworking people who might want to engage in public service are
not summarily proscribed'' from working at the Pentagon.
   Tower noted that Donald J. Atwood, whom he has chosen as deputy
defense secretary, has been vice chairman of the General Motors
Corp., a major Pentagon contractor. He said other top aides would be
drawn from the defense industry as well.
   The atmosphere at the hearings was polite as the senators
questioned their former colleague. Tower, a Texas Republican, spent
24 years in the Senate, including a stint as chairman of the Armed
Services Committee from 1981-84.
   Nunn told Tower that ``I know you and I know you are an honest
person.''
   ``Frankly, the difficulty here is not that you have worked for a
contractor as a consultant, but a number of them, five or six or
seven of the major corporations,'' Nunn said. ``If you were to
recuse (not involve) yourself on all of them, you couldn't be
secretary of defense.''
   Tower told the committee that ``I faced up to this problem when I
was chairman'' of the commission appointed by President Reagan to
investigate the Iran-Contra affair.
   In that role, he said, he was required ``to inquire into and
investigate the actions of a president to whom I was deeply loyal.
It was not a pleasant experience.''
   ``My loyalty to my country transcends any of these loyalties,''
said Tower.
   At the opening of his second day of testimony, Tower told the
Armed Services Committee about his role as a consultant to several
major defense contractors, including Rockwell International, Martin
Marietta, Textron, LTV and British Aerospace.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., asked Tower whether he thought tougher
laws were needed to prevent the type of activities alleged in the
current investigation of transfer of information on pending
contracts being sold by Pentagon employees to defense contractors
and consultants.
   Tower said he never engaged in such activities, but that ``in
light of what has happened, (laws) should be'' tightened.
   ``To say what I would advise in detail is a little bit difficult
for me now because I need to get into the problem and get a handle
on it before I could recommend any specific legislative proposals
along that line,'' he said.
   He said legislation was needed to ``reduce the likelihood if not
foreclose anyone who had been in the Defense Department from
profiting unfairly unethically, or illegally or inordinately'' in an
industry job.
   Tower told lawmakers Wednesday that as of Dec. 1 he had severed
his ties with defense contractors he had worked for as a consultant
over the past two years and did not ``stand to gain from the
prosperity of any former associate.''
   In other testimony Wednesday, Tower disavowed the label of
``mindless hawk'' and promised to take a hard look at all weapons
systems in trimming the defense budget.
   He said the new Bush administration will conduct a thorough
review in which ``nothing is sacred'' while it searches for
solutions to the budget deficit.
   ``There is no room in the defense budget for costly mistakes,''
he said.
   Tower, who championed Reagan's trillion-dollar military buildup,
said he is realistic about the constraints imposed by the budget
deficit.
   ``I am not such a mindless hawk that I will come before you and
ask for increases I know you will not grant,'' he said.
   Tower declined to specify what cuts might be made, repeating the
refrain that nothing is sacred when questioned about the MX and
Midgetman nuclear missiles and the number of Navy aircraft carriers.
   He stressed, however, that the new administration will ``tailor
the military to the strategy.''

   The Navy successfully launched the
Trident 2 submarine missile on its 19th and final test flight from a
land-based pad Thursday and said it is now ready to begin critical
underwater firings.
   The three-stage, 44-foot missile thundered away from its seaside
launch pad at 4:07 a.m. EST and left a fiery wake as it propelled a
dummy warhead to an undisclosed Atlantic Ocean target.
   A Navy statement said the test was successful, ending a series of
Trident 2 land-launch tests that began Jan. 15, 1987. Officials had
planned 20 such tests, but decided to stop at 19 because of recent
successes.
   Of the 19 tests, the Navy rated 15 successful and one a ``no
test,'' which occurred when an Air Force safety officer destroyed
the missile by triggering on-board explosives after radar indicated
it was off course.
   The missile was deliberately sent off course to test the guidance
system's ability to correct its path, but the safety officer was not
notified.
   The USS Tennessee, the first of nine nuclear submarines being
built to carry Trident 2 missiles, is scheduled to conduct the first
underwater firing of the weapon in the next several weeks in
Atlantic waters off Cape Canaveral.
   Several undersea tests are planned and the missile is to become
operational later this year.
   The Tennessee, commissioned Dec. 17 in New London, Conn., is
scheduled to be fitted with 24 of the missiles, each capable of
propelling 10 nuclear warheads to different targets more than 5,000
miles away.

<TEXT>
   Reported cases of anti-Semitic harassment rose 41
percent in the United States in 1988, and anti-Semitic vandalism was
up 18.5 percent, according to a survey released today by the
Anti-Defamation League.
   The figures showed the number of such incidents in 1988 reached
their highest level in five years.
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith, called the nearly 1,300 incidents reported by law
enforcement authorities in 40 states, the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico ``disturbing'' and ``a sign of concern.''
   Foxman could not point to a specific cause for the increase but
cited ``specific stimulants,'' including activities by organized
hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi Skinheads;
counter-activities during the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht,
observed by many as the beginning of the Holocaust, and political
unrest in Israel's West Bank and Gaza.
   Foxman also pointed to an increase in anti-Semitic incidents on
college campuses and in the South, which has a small Jewish
population.
   The survey showed that there were 458 incidents of harassment
reported in 1988 compared to 324 in 1987, an increase of 41 percent.
The cases included seven arson incidents, one bombing and seven
attempted arsons.
   There were 823 incidents of anti-Semitic vandalism last year, up
from 694 the previous year, according to the survey. It marked the
second sharp increase in a row after a four-year decline.

<HEAD>Power Plant Up, but Many Iranians Still in Dark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Part of a giant Iranian power plant
damaged in the war with Iraq went back into service Thursday, a
radio report said, but Iranians still face blackouts.
   A 400-megawatt unit of the Neka plant in northern Iran began
operation, Tehran radio said. But the plant on the Caspian Sea will
produce only a fraction of its pre-war capacity of 1,760 megawatts.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said the plant will boost the
country's sluggish power output by 6 percent. The facility was
heavily damaged during the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war and rebuilt
following the Aug. 20 cease-fire.
   ``Power plants have have been targeted as one of the priority
projects in Iran's (post-war) reconstruction plan,'' Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi said during Thursday's opening ceremony, the radio
said.
   Musavi has said electricity demand increased to 7,850 megawatts
from 2,876 megawatts in the past 10 years.
   The Neka plant, pounded twice in long-range Iraqi air attacks,
will cost around $50 million to repair completely.
   Power Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh was quoted by the radio two
weeks ago as saying power blackouts would continue in coming months
because not enough power could be restored to meet demand.
   The daily blackouts, which have lasted since the 1979 revolution
that put Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in power, typically last up to
six hours in the major cities. Often, there is no advance warning.
   There has been a long-running debate in the newspapers about
whether the Power Ministry should announce the power cuts in
advance. A ministry official said authorities fear burglars would
plan ahead if such announcements were made.

   A victim of car theft is offering a

catch a local car thief _ any local car thief.
   Scott Thomsen of Blountville said he decided to put up the money
after police informed him the odds are slim they'll find the person
who stole and torched his car Jan. 21.
   ``What inspired me was the people down at the police department
said the only possibility of catching these guys was a reward,'' he
said.
   Thomsen said his offer, made Wednesday, is only good for the next
two weeks and only if the information leads to a conviction in any
Kingsport auto theft case.
   Police Detective Doug Harris said car thieves looking for a quick
way to get somewhere often burn cars to destroy any physical
evidence.

<HEAD>D.C. Council Members Said Urging Mayor to Retire</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs pvs grafs 2-3, ``The Washington ... Democrats,'' to show
both reports with five council members attending.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About half of the members of the city council
have privately urged Mayor Marion Barry Jr. not to run for
re-election in 1990, as federal prosecutors negotiated with the
mayor's attorney to broaden their investigation into his personal
activities, it was reported today.
   The Washington Post and WUSA-TV said five councilmen met with
Barry at the home of member Nadine P. Winter on Saturday and told
him they were concerned about his well-being, how the city was being
run, the political fallout and possible damage to the city's
relationship with the federal government.
   All the participants are Democrats. The council has 12 members.
   Barry, who has been in office 10 years, confirmed a meeting took
place but said the report of the council members' advice were
``erroneous.'' He said the meeting concerned only issues such as the
budget and housing.
   Others attending the meeting declined to comment on whether
Barry's political future was discussed.
   In the past two weeks, Barry has testified twice before a federal
grand jury looking into a Dec. 22 incident at a downtown hotel, as
well as the possible misuse of government funds in a joint
D.C.-Virgin Islands personnel project.
   Two police detectives investigating a drug complaint at the hotel
left after learning Barry was in the room of the suspect, Charles
Lewis.
   Lewis was the former director for the personnel project for the
Virgin Islands government. Police said traces of cocaine were found
in his room.
   According to the Post, prosecutors have sought to broaden the
hotel inquiry by asking Barry to submit to grand jury questioning
about whether he has used drugs in the last five years.
   Prosecutors and Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, have
discussed the scope of the questions to be posed to the mayor before
the grand jury, the newspaper reported.
   Mundy said Wednesday that prosecutors ``are not trying to
compel'' Barry to testify about whether he has used drugs. ``That
statement is untrue. They have not asked that question,'' he said.
   Barry has repeatedly denied ever using drugs or knowingly being
associated with drug dealers or users.
   After Barry's second grand jury appearance Tuesday, Mundy said he
did not anticipate the mayor testifying again.

   Militant Sinhalese killed at least 45
people in pre-election violence, and the government ordered troops
on alert Thursday to protect political rallies, officials said.
   The Defense Ministry warned militants against ``subversive plans
to intimidate people, promote clashes between political parties, and
disrupt the Feb. 4 Sri Lanka independence day celebrations.''
   Troops went on alert nationwide to protect political party
campaigning for parliamentary elections Feb. 15, officials said on
condition of anonymity.
   A separatist war waged by ethnic Tamils in northern and eastern
Sri Lanka has prompted the Sinhalese backlash. Tamils make up 18
percent of the population of this island nation off the southern tip
of India.
   Officials said shortly after President Ranasinghe Premadasa took
office Jan. 2 that India had begun withdrawing troops it dispatched
in 1987 to try to disarm Tamil insurgents.
   At least 10 opposition candidates of the 1,393 people running for
225 seats in the national Parliament have been killed this month.
   On Wednesday, three attackers raked a house with machine guns at
Katugastotta about 60 miles from Colombo, killing opposition
candidate Nissanka Dharmatilleke, two brothers, and two supporters,
military officials said. They declined to say who was responsible.
   Police officials speaking on condition of anonymity blamed the
24-hour flareup in violence on militants of the Sinhalese People's
Liberation Front.
   The front opposes government efforts to make peace with the Tamil
rebels and has vowed to disrupt the elections.
   The opposition parties have blamed the candidates' killings on
supporters of the United National Party headed by Premadasa. Party
members deny the charge and blame the militant Sinhalese group. The
Front says it is not responsible.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's population of 16
million people and dominate politics and the military. Tamils make
up 18 percent.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 companies have agreed to pay
the full $32.5 million cost of cleaning up a southern New Jersey
landfill on the Superfund list of the nation's top 20 hazardous
waste sites, officials say.
   Christopher Daggett, acting director of the Department of
Environmental Protection, said the agreement may be the first major
settlement of its kind in which the polluters agreed to cover all
work requested by the government.
   The GEMS Inc. landfill in Gloucester Township is ranked fifth on
the state's priority list of 110 sites eligible for Superfund
cleanup money.
   The site is owned by Gloucester Township and leased to GEMS Inc.
For more than a decade it was used as a repository for numerous
hazardous wastes, including DDT, oil, paint sludge and ink.
   The 60-acre site was closed in 1980 after the state found that
ground and surface water _ but not drinking water _ had been
contaminated.
   Daggett said the pact, announced Tuesday, will pave the way for
regrading, capping and other work to control the spread of hazardous
waste from the landfill.
   The settlement involves 104 parties, including Amadei Sand and
Gravel Inc., a past owner of the landfill, GEMS Inc., 48 chemical
waste generators, 53 waste transporters and the township.
   The parties agreed to pay all cleanup costs and reimburse the
state for the cost of overseeing the work, the DEP announced.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-six years after the confrontation that
brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, Americans and Cubans
who led their countries through the Cuban missile crisis will meet
here for the first time to discuss it.
   ``A lot of things were done, a lot of things were said that
created a great deal of bitterness,'' said James Blight of Harvard
University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, which is
organizing the conference.
   ``This is a rather risky experience. We don't know quite what is
going to happen,'' he told reporters Thursday.
   Americans and Soviets have discussed the October 1962 crisis over
the deployment of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba at conferences
sponsored by the Kennedy school in 1987.
   But the conference that begins Thursday night with a private
reception is the first time that the U.S. and Cuban participants
will meet face-to-face.
   Scheduled to be among the participants were former U.S. Defense
Secretary Robert S. McNamara and Sergio DelValle, a long-time
confidant of Cuban leader Fidel Castro. DelValle is a member of the
Cuban Communist Party's Central Committee and was the military chief
of staff in 1962.
   Among the other U.S. participants were McGeorge Bundy, Theodore
Sorensen, Pierre Salinger and Sen. Edward Kennedy.
   From the Soviet side, former President Andrei A. Gromyko and the
former ambassador to Washington, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, were expected
to attend. Gromyko, 79, was the Soviet foreign minister in 1962.
   Each side has its own name for the crisis and its own version of
events, and ``for the first time we will try to merge those three
crises into one oral history,'' said Bruce Allyn of the Kennedy
school.
   Organizers said only in isolated cases have any top officials of
the administration of John F. Kennedy ever met any of the Cuban
officials who were in top leadership spots of their country during
the 1962 crisis.
   Much of the conference will be closed to the press, but
organizers said the opening session Friday and a round-table
discussion Saturday would be open. A news conference of the leaders
of the three delegations is planned for Sunday.
   Organizers only found out Thursday that the Cuban delegation
would include three senior officials, DelValle, Politburo member
Jorge Risquet and another Central Committee member, Emilio Aragones
Navarro.
   They said the series of conferences in the past year and a half
indicate that officials who led their governments through the crisis
have a personal interest in establishing an accurate picture of what
happened.
   Because of the age of many of the participants, this is likely to
be the last major conference on the Cuban missile crisis, said
Philip J. Brenner, an expert on Cuba attending the conference from
the American University in Washington.
   Blight, co-author of a book on the crisis, ``On the Brink,'' said
American scholars are hoping to get answers from senior Soviet
officials on several questions.
   Included are why the Soviet Union apparently believed it was in
imminent peril of an all-out nuclear attack by the United States and
its allies, and why Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev had the
missiles sent secretly to Cuba, rather than making their deployment
a public response to deployment of U.S. missiles in Turkey and
elsewhere.

<HEAD>Challenger Pilot's Widow to Marry Army General in June</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   June Scobee, widow of Challenger space shuttle
pilot Dick Scobee, is engaged to marry an Army general in June and
will step down as chairman of the Challenger Center for Space
Science Education, an aide said Thursday.
   Mrs. Scobee, 46, will marry Lt. Gen. Don Rodgers, commander of
the Global Army Information Systems Command at Fort Huachuca, Ariz.,
according to Lisa Turner, director of public and media relations for
the Challenger center in Houston.
   The two met last Easter at a sunrise service at Arlington
National Cemetery, where Mrs. Scobee had gone to visit the grave of
her husband, who died with the six other astronauts in the Jan. 28,
1986, explosion of the space shuttle.
   Rodgers, 54, is a widower. They did not see each other for five
months after that initial meeting, but then began dating and now
have set June 3 as their wedding date.
   Mrs. Scobee has spearheaded efforts to raise $30 million to
finance several centers around the country to teach children and
teachers about space. It is halfway toward that goal, with $5
million raised privately and $10 million recently appropriated by
Congress, Ms. Turner said.
   Mrs. Scobee will remain on the Challenger center's advisory board
after her two-year term as chairman expires March 16, Ms. Turner
said.
   Mrs. Scobee has two grown children, Kathie, 27, a media
consultant in College Station, Texas, and Rich, 25, an Air Force
pilot flying F-16s in West Germany.
   The Challenger center opened its prototype educational facility
at the Houston Museum of Natural Science last summer, and plans to
open three more this year at the Boston Museum of Science, the
Pacific Science Center in Seattle and at the Howard B. Owens Science
Center in Prince George's County, Md., near the Goddard Space Flight
Center.
   The center also plans to build a ``Space Life Station'' in the
nation's capital near the Mall.
   Mrs. Scobee, who has a doctorate in education, also plans to
resume her work as an educational consultant, at least on a
voluntary basis, Ms. Turner said.
   She will be the first Challenger widow or widower to remarry.

   If all goes as planned, actor Burt Reynolds
will outmaneuver helicopters and dodge simulated gunfire in an

is a more immediate threat.
   Residents living near the Lantana Correctional Institution say
they've had enough of breakouts lately _ real or as part of a

   Reynolds' Blue Period Productions will film the escape from the
minimum-security prison for the third episode of the ``B.L.
Stryker'' detective series, publicist Carol Feder said Wednesday.
   The plot is a little too authentic for Lantana Town Manager Don
Harvey, who told Department of Corrections officials he objected to
the idea because his community is tense over a series of escapes
from the prison last year.
   ``The timing is absolutely inappropriate,'' Harvey said. ``I
don't think this community needs to go through any other trauma with
real or simulated events at LCI.''
   To avoid crowds of onlookers, producers normally don't release
advance information about filming locations, Feder said. But
concerns from Harvey and others prompted the production company to
alert residents to Friday's filming.
   ``We'll be posting notices in the area so residents won't be
concerned. We wanted to make sure nobody got upset,'' Feder said.

   The father in television's ``Family Ties'' has
a message for families in the real world: Be careful at railroad
crossings.
   ``Look, listen and live,'' actor Michael Gross says in a series
of public service announcements to be broadcast on TV and radio
starting March 1.
   The campaign is sponsored by Operation Lifesaver, a rail-crossing
safety program the Union Pacific Railroad started in 1972. Its
message is delivered throughout the United States and Canada.
   Gross has qualifications beyond his acting ability, Ed Trandahl
of the Union Pacific said.
   His grandfather and great-grandfather were railroad workers, and
Gross worked summers as a brakeman for the Chicago &amp; North Western
Transportation Co. while attending college.
   ``A lot of you parents may have children who are just getting
their driver's license,'' one script says. ``Do them a favor _ and
yourself, too. Tell them to be especially careful at highway
railroad crossings.''

   Maestro Riccardo Muti's dream night for the
Philadelphia Orchestra came true when a television station
pre-empted network fare and moved a crew and co-hosts into the
Academy of Music.
   Muti and the musicians brought Beethoven's Symphony No. 4 to life
in a special two-hour ``Come And Meet The Music'' concert carried
live Wednesday night on KYW-TV.
   The effort, he said afterward, was a ``complete success'' no
matter what the viewer ratings turned out to be. He found a way to
reach from the Academy stage right into the home and he liked it.
   ``It was a good audience ... a good audience,'' he said,
referring both to those in the hall and those who tuned in.
   ``You need television because when you play a concert hall, you
can only reach two to three thousand people. You can reach many more
with television, and that's important.''

   The 1989 Golden Pen of Freedom Award has been given
to Sergei Grigoryants, founding editor and publisher of the
independent Soviet magazine Glasnost, the International Federation
of Newspaper Publishers said Thursday.
   The Paris-based federation applauded Grigoryants' dedication to
freedom of expression, but said it was concerned that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had denounced him as a ``parasite.''
   Grigoryants, 47, was hailed as a ``brave man whose treatment has
shown how much the attitudes of the Soviet authorities to the press
_ newly evidenced in the draft of a severely restrictive press law _
must change if the widely proclaimed policy of glasnost is ever to
become other than a propagandist's mockery,'' said the statement
issued after a meeting of the 30-member federation board in Zurich.
   Gorbachev has made glasnost, or the opening of Soviet society, a
hallmark of his rule.
   Grigoryants' wife, who is visiting Paris, said the award was
``wonderful and a tribute to all he has tried to do.''
   Grigoryants will be invited to receive his award at the 42nd
World Congress of Newspaper Publishers being organized by the
federation in New Orleans, Lousiana, June 11-14.
   The Golden Pen is awarded annually by the federation, which
strives to defend and promote press freedom and the economic
independence of news publishers as an essential condition for
freedom.

   A woman will become a full-time network
weeknight television news anchor within the next decade, according
to the first woman to work in such a job _ albeit temporarily.
   ``I wouldn't want to predict what year,'' said Marlene Sanders,
who made TV history in 1964 when she sat in on NBC for an ailing Ron
Cochran.
   Ms. Sanders, age ``58, the same as Dan Rather'' will be in
October, spoke this week to the local chapter of American Women in
Radio and Television.
   When women anchors break the weeknight network sex barrier
``depends on how women do in the country at large,'' said Ms.
Sanders, co-author with Marcia Rock of ``Waiting for Prime Time: The
Women of Television News.''
   ``When we see more women in high places, it will filter down to
the networks,'' she said.
   After a decade as an Emmy-winning correspondent for CBS News, she
fell victim to a wave of network cuts in 1987, turning down an offer
to work nights and weekends for CBS Radio.
   ``I wasn't fired, exactly,'' she said. ``I decided to take my
chances in the outside world.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly 1.8 million workers covered by major
collective-bargaining contracts signed in 1988 will receive average
annual pay raises of 2.4 percent, the government said Thursday.
   For the first year of those 415 contracts, covering bargaining
units with 1,000 or more members, the average pay gain is 2.6
percent, the Labor Department said.
   That compared to average first-year increases of 1.8 percent and
overall annual raises of 2.6 percent in those workers' prior
contracts, most of which had been negotiated in 1985 or 1986.
   On the whole, workers in manufacturing jobs fared less well than
workers in non-manufacturing positions.
   Nearly 80 percent of the 1.79 million owners affected by
contracts signed last year saw a boost in pay, while 2 percent face
wage cuts and the rest had their wages stay the same.
   About 28 percent of the workers affected in 1988 also received
some form of lump-sum payment, generally performance or attendance
bonuses. The Labor Department said 38 percent of workers were
eligible for cost-of-living adjustments under their new pacts.
   Settlements affecting 706,000 manufacturing workers contained
average pay increases of 2.2 percent in the first year and 2.1
percent a year over the life of the contract. Wage increases
averaged 2.8 percent in the first year and 2.5 percent annually
overall for the more than 1 million workers in the non-manufacturing
sector of the economy covered by major settlements signed in 1988.
   The average duration of contracts settled in 1988 was 33.3 months.

   A man who admits he ``had a terrible time

   Warble a ``do re mi'' into the ``Vocalizer 1000,'' and the notes
come out sounding like they were played on a piano, or a steel drum,
or one of 26 other instruments you select.
   If your ``do'' is a little sharp and your ``mi'' wavers, the
space-age circuitry makes the notes sound right. It even adds adrum
accompanyment.
   It may seem like a high-tech kazoo but the Vocalizer is more
sophisticated than that, said Darby Williams, who sells the item for
$300 and says even professional musicians are hooking the item up to
their synthsizers.
   His clarinet troubles of youth now far behind him (``I wasn't
much better at the guitar''), the 35-year-old Williams is president
of Breakaway Music Systems of San Mateo.
   Breakaway started selling the Vocalizer in the bible of fancy

has ``sold thousands on thousands of them,'' said Williams, who

   They missed a week of classes, but two high

they learned a valuable lesson about charm and persistence in the
nation's capital.
   Emmanuel Remy, 16, a reporter, and Jeremy Brilliant, 17, a
photographer, wrote to Republican officials in November to obtain
media credentials. They raised money for the trip from local
businesses and set out Jan. 16.
   But when they arrived in Washington, they learned inauguration
planners had overbooked journalists. No media passes would be issued
to students, they were told.
   Not taking ``no'' for an answer, Brilliant, a senior, headed for
the inauguration's news media headquarters, made small talk with
officials and obtained a single pass to several events. Remy decided
to visit the headquarters himself to try out his charm. It worked.
   ``The guy took me out into the hall and said, `I don't normally
do this ... I've turned down national media,''' said Remy, a junior.
``He gave me the passes and said, `Don't write anything bad. Now get
lost.'''
   Their week in Washington included meetings with Ohio congressmen
and Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., the opening celebration, several
inaugural balls and receptions, inauguration church services and the
inauguration itself.
   Their photos and stories, including an interview with Vice
President Dan Quayle's son Tucker, will appear in Friday's edition

   Women whose beauty salons have been barred
from using traditional brush curlers are making a hair-raising noise
in the state Legislature, which is considering a bill to lift the
ban.
   ``This was the one thing we found during our campaign that people
were really opposed to,'' said Rep. Wilbur Vander Vorst.
   The state Board of Cosmetology issued its edict banning brush
curlers last July. The board contended the curlers, which are rather
like little round hairbrushes without handles, are unsanitary
because hair tends to stick in the bristles.
   But many women prefer them.
   Rep. Kathi Gilmore said the board should have sanctioned beauty
parlors whose brush rollers were found to have stray hairs on them,
rather than banning a vital tool of the trade. Gilmore, who is
sponsoring legislation to lift the prohibition, testified at a state
House committee hearing Wednesday.
   Legislators said they are being bombarded with calls about
Gilmore's bill. Gilmore said she had received more than 70, while
Sen. David O'Connell, reported getting more than 200.
   The committee took no immediate action on the legislation.

<TEXT>
   Three members of a polygamist clan were
sentenced today to prison terms of up to 15 years for the slaying of
a law officer during a shootout that ended a 13-day standoff at
their farm last year.
   The penalties will be served after they complete federal prison
terms for taking part in the bombing of a Mormon chapel.
   State District Judge Michael Murphy sentenced clan leader Addam
Swapp and brother-in-law John Timothy Singer to one to 15 years for
manslaughter and Swapp's brother, Jonathan, to a year in jail for
negligent homicide.
   ``These defendants acted as anarchists,'' the judge said, ``and
this court has been presented with no credible information that, if
given the opportunity, they would not again engage in anarchism and
armed conflict.''
   The sentences were pronounced two days before the anniversary of
the shootout in Marion that left state Corrections Lt. Fred House
dead and Swapp seriously wounded.
   Singer and the Swapp brothers had been charged with murder in
House's death, but a jury convicted them of lesser charges Dec. 22.
   In May, the three defendants and clan matriarch Vickie Singer,
the mother of John Timothy Singer and Addam Swapp's two wives, were
convicted of federal violations in the bombing and standoff.
   A federal judge sentenced Addam Swapp to 15 years in prison, John
Timothy Singer and Jonathan Swapp to 10 and Vickie Singer to five
for those crimes.
   Murphy today rejected a request to allow the defendants to serve
their state sentences concurrently with the federal prison terms.
   The standoff between the clan and 100 law enforcement officers
began after Addam Swapp bombed a nearby Mormon chapel. Authorities
did not storm the compound for fear of harming the nine children who
were inside with six adults.
   House and another police dog handler had joined an FBI team in an
attempt to arrest the Swapp brothers. He was directing his reluctant
dog toward the pair when he was struck by a bullet that nicked the
armhole of his armored vest.
   Singer, 21, admitted firing the shot but insisted he was shooting
at the dogs. Jonathan Swapp, 22, also acknowledged firing his rifle
during the shootout but said he was trying to keep his wounded
brother from being hit again.
   Addam Swapp, 27, who was wounded in the arm and chest by an FBI
sharpshooter, did not fire.
   Swapp has said the chapel bombing was a divinely inspired act
intended to trigger the resurrection of his late father-in-law, John
Singer, and the collapse of a ``wicked and corrupt'' church and
state.
   Singer, the clan's patriarch, was shot in 1979 by police during
an arrest attempt at the same farm.
   He who had clashed with authorities over his refusal to send his
children to school or teach a state-approved curriculum, and had
broken with the Mormon Church over his polygamy, which has been
renounced by the church.

   A trucker apparently became confused at a
rail crossing and drove between two sets of tracks early today
before her rig was struck by a southbound freight train and then by
a northbound one, authorities said.
   A passenger in the tractor-trailer was killed, and a brakeman was
slightly injured.
   The truck driver escaped unhurt moments before the fiery
accident, sheriff's deputies said.
   ``I've got no explanation on why that woman drove 500 feet on our
railroad tracks, but that's literally what happened,'' CSX spokesman
Lloyd Lewis said.
   Sheriff Carl Runion said the truck driver, who may have confused
by the curve of the road, realized her mistake and apparently was
trying to back the rig onto the highway when a train clipped the cab
on one side about 5:30 a.m.
   Moments later, a train coming in the opposite direction struck
the back of the trailer. He said the rig, sandwiched between the
trains, was dragged along the tracks, spreading flames for several
hundred yards along the tracks.
   One freight car jumped the tracks, Lewis said.
   A woman, apparently sleeping in a bunk of the tractor cab, was
killed, authorities said. A CSX brakeman was treated at a hospital
and released.
   The names of the dead woman and the driver were not immediately
released.
   Lewis said the the engineer in the lead engine of the first train
reported the truck's headlights were off and were turned on after it
was too late for him to stop.

<HEAD>Study Questions Greenhouse Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study of U.S. weather records for the
past century may raise questions about the theory that the Earth is
being warmed like the inside of a greenhouse.
   Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
report that they can find no evidence of any overall temperature
increase for the United States, although weather does vary
considerably from year to year.
   The report, in the January edition of Geophysical Research
Letters, showed no significant change in the nation's average
temperature or precipitation between 1895 and 1987.
   Researchers agree, however, that since the study covers only a
small portion of the Earth, studies of other areas might have
different results. And while the new study is not necessarily
inconsistent with a so-called greenhouse effect, it fuels an
escalating scientific debate.
   Claims that a greenhouse-like warming has already begun have
attracted widespread publicity recently, with the heat and drought
this past summer attracting additional attention.
   According to the theory, the increasing amount of carbon dioxide
and some other gases in the atmosphere tend to trap heat from the
sun, warming the earth in somewhat the same way as the glass warms a
greenhouse.
   Such a warming could damage crop growing areas, melt the polar
ice caps, raise sea levels and have other dire effects, according to
a variety of analyses that have been published.
   Scientists expressed skepticism about whether the warming has
already begun, however, at last month's meeting of the American
Geophysical Union in San Francisco.
   Indeed, some climate experts say any warming would likely result
in more cloudiness, and that would tend to cool the Earth by
reflecting some sunlight back into space.
   In addition, a study published in the Journal of Climate in
November disclosed that an apparent climate warming of as much as 1
degree Fahrenheit could be attributed to the heat generated by
growing cities, since many weather stations are located in urban
areas.
   ``The most important result of this study is that there is no
statistically significant evidence of an overall increase in annual
temperature or change in annual precipitation for the contiguous
U.S., 1895-1987,'' concluded the authors of the new analysis.
   That report was compiled by Kirby Hanson of the NOAA Air
Resources Laboratory, George A. Maul of the NOAA Atlantic
Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory and Thomas R. Karl of
the National Climatic Data Center.
   They looked at both temperature and moisture since the greenhouse
theory holds that a warming of the climate would likely result in
changes in rainfall patterns, causing drought in some areas.
   ``Assuming the numbers are right, they are not inconsistent''
with the greenhouse theory, responded John Topping of the Climate
Institute.
   Topping, who organized a recent conference on coping with the
greenhouse effect, noted that the study covers only the United
States _ only about 6 percent of the Earth _ and suggested that
similar analyses of other areas might have different results.
   Hanson has concurred that the study covers only a small part of
the world and that the finding may only represent a regional
variation rather than a worldwide trend.
   James E. Hansen, director of the National Aviation and Space
Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said Wednesday
that he was not surprised by the result.
   Hansen, who told Congress last summer that he believes the
greenhouse warming has begun to affect Earth, said that the argument
is over whether the warming has become large enough to measure.
   Determining that may be hard to do, however, the NOAA researchers
pointed out in their analysis.
   Lack of good records in some areas and changes in instruments,
methods of observation, exposure of thermometers, time of
observations and other problems make the problem of comparing
historical records extremely complex.
   In their study they analyzed records from some 6,000 observing
points over 93 years and found considerable year-to-year variation
but no long-term trend other than an increase in precipitation, in
the fall, between 1970 and 1987.

   The polar bears at the Denver Zoo helped sell
voters on a penny-per-$10 sales tax for cultural institutions that
is turning metro area residents into some of the nation's top
supporters of the arts and sciences.
   The ``polar bear tax'' _ so called because campaigners used a
drawing of a zoo bear to promote it, in order to defuse talk that
the arts are elitist _ sailed to victory in the Nov. 8 election with
75 percent of the vote in the six-county Denver region.
   The nine-member Cultural Arts District board, which will spend
the tax revenues, was selected this month and will soon send out its
first grants.
   Consultant Floyd Ciruli, who oversaw the campaign for the tax and
continues to advise the board, says the 0.1 percent sales tax is
unprecedented both in the amount of money it raises and the range of
organizations it helps.
   He hopes it will change Denver's sense of itself from ``cow
town'' to ``culture town'' and ensure a healthy financial future for
organizations that have seen their federal and city support sag in
this era of tight budgets.
   Every cultural organization in the area is eligible to receive
funds from the new tax, from mainstays like the symphony orchestra,
which last year had a brush with near-bankruptcy, to the most
esoteric dance and theater groups.
   The tax breaks down to a little more than $6 per person annually,
more than any other community pays per person in local tax money for
culture, according to Ciruli.
   Denver arts patrons got the idea for the tax from St. Louis,
where a property tax helps fund a few of the city's largest cultural
institutions. San Francisco draws from a lodging tax to help some of
its major facilities. But Denver's tax is drawn from the whole metro
area and finances many more institutions.
   Lawmakers rejected the idea of a culture tax in 1986 because of
squabbling in the arts community, said Greg Geissler, who heads the
city of Denver's Cultural Affairs Commission. Local arts and
government officials then hammered out the existing plan that offers
``something for everyone,'' he said. The Legislature endorsed it
last year, then the voters gave final approval in November.
   ``In the long run, the health of the large institutions is
directly tied to the overall health of the whole arts community,''
Geissler said.
   The largest chunk of tax revenues _ about $8.5 million _ is
earmarked for four big-budget institutions: the Natural History
Museum, the Denver Art Museum, the zoo and the Denver Botanic
Gardens.
   A second chunk _ about $3.3 million _ will go to midsize agencies
like the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, the Denver Symphony
Orchestra and the Denver Ballet.The remaining money, about 10
percent of the total, will go back to the six counties to be
distributed to small groups.
   There was little organized opposition to the cultural facilities
tax, but some critics said it taxed everybody to pay for ``elitist''
programs attended by the wealthy.
   To counter that criticism, backers turned to the popular zoo and
its polar bears, stressing that cultural facilities are used by a
wide variety of people and saying they help foster tourism.
Proponents said the alternative to the tax was high admission fees,
which price the poor out of supposedly public facilities.
   ``Cultural programming is becoming one of the best tourist and
economic development tools that you have,'' said Ciruli.
   ``There's no doubt that some of the funds _ a small part _ will
go to cultural styles that are enjoyed by very narrow groups of
people, but that's a tradeoff. ... There's a lot of diversity and
that's good.''
   Tom Peterson, the Denver Zoo's marketing director, said the zoo
will use its share of tax proceeds to expand education and
conservation programs and for projects such as renovation of a
display of grizzly and black bears. As for the polar bears, who
helped pass the tax: They already have new quarters.

<HEAD>`Big Ticket' Orders Rose at Robust Pace in December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for ``big ticket'' durable
goods rose at a robust 6.4 percent pace in December, the government
said Thursday in a report that anaylsts cited as evidence of
unabated economic strength heading into the new year.
   The surprisingly strong increase was the biggest since an 8.7
percent rise last June and brought demand for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, to a seasonally adjusted
$130.85 billion in December.
   The figures reflected widespread demand in both civilian and
military categories. Non-electrical machinery was the only category
to post a decline.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. in
Lexington, Mass., said the report indicates that ``so far, there's
certainly not any signs of slowdown'' in the economy.
   But she cautioned, ``While it's very strong on the surface, the
disturbing undertone is that machine orders were off.''
   December's orders closed out the year on a strong note, with
demand over the last 12 months totaling $1.43 trillion, a 10.8
percent increase from 1987, when orders had been up 7.6 percent over
the previous year.
   Last year's pace was the best showing since a 12.3 percent
increase in 1984.
   Orders had edged up just 1.2 percent in 1985 and 0.4 percent in
1986, when America was losing both domestic and overseas sales to
foreign manufacturers.
   But U.S. manufacturers have enjoyed an export-led rebound the
last two years as a decline in the value of the dollar against
foreign currencies made American products more competitive overseas.
   Economist John Hagens of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said
the health of the U.S. manufacturing industry in 1988 showed that,
``at a good price, U.S. goods can hold their own in the world
market.''
   Hagens said that with the dollar unlikley to fall further, ``the
phenomenal growth in orders and exports generally is not going to be
there for 1989'' but that orders still should come in at a moderate
pace.
   In other reports Thursday, the Labor Department said:
   _The prices Americans paid for imported goods rose 4.1 percent
during 1988, with prices up 1.6 percent in the final three months of
the year.
   The fall of the dollar, while improving the competitiveness of
U.S. goods overseas and helping to lower the trade deficit, also
boosts the price of foreign goods in American markets.
   _First-year pay raises averaged 2.6 percent for workers in
private industry affected by collective bargaining settlements
signed last year. For the full term of major contracts settled last
year, wage increases averaged 2.4 percent.
   December's increase in orders for durable goods was paced by a
huge jump in the volatile military category, which oscillates
depending on when big government contracts are signed. Military
orders increased 21.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted
$10.16 billion after a 21.5 percent decrease in November.
   Even excluding defense, however, orders for durable goods were up
5.4 percent in December.
   In another erratic category, transportation orders increased 20
percent in December to $38.88 billion after a 7.2 percent decrease a
month earlier. The improvement included large gains in the auto,
aircraft and shipbuilding industries.
   Excluding transportation, the December increase in orders for
durale goods was 1.6 percent.
   There also was strength in orders for non-defense capital goods,
a category that is closely watched for signs of business intentions
to expand and modernize. Demand in this category rose 7.8 percent to
$38.58 billion last month, the steepest increase since a 12.5
percent jump in June.
   In other industries, orders for primary metals rose 5.3 percent
to $13.30 billion and demand for electrical machinery was up 1.1
percent to $20.34 billion. Orders for non-electrical machinery
dropped 3.2 percent to $20.71 billion; most of that decline was in
engines and turbines.
   Shipments of durable goods overall rose 3.8 percent to $124.46
billion in December, following a 1.2 percent increase in November.
   Shipments for the year totaled $1.39 trillion, up 9.9 percent
from 1987.

   President Bush today urged top federal
executives to help fulfill his quest for an administration beyond
ethical reproach, where government service is seen as ``a noble
calling.''
   ``There is a mandate to fulfill. And there are problems to
solve,'' Bush said in prepared remarks to some 3,700 top government
managers.
   Bush said the guiding principle of his policy will be ``simply to
know right from wrong. ... To avoid even the appearance of what is
wrong.''
   Bush began stressing ethics during the presidential campaign,
when the Reagan administration, in which he was vice president, came
under fire for what was dubbed the ``sleaze factor.'' More than 100
members of the Reagan administration at various times were accused
of unethical or improper behavior.
   Bush tried to neutralize that criticism by promising to make
creation of an ethics panel one his first acts as president.
   Continuing his emphasis on ethics, Bush made his first speech
outside the White House, going to the nearby Constitution Hall of
the Daughters of the American Revolution. There, he spoke to members
of the Senior Executive Service, comprised of top-level department
and agency managers, most of them career government employees.
   ``I pledge to try to make federal jobs more challenging, more
satisfying and more fulfilling,'' he said. ``I am dedicated to
making the system work and making it work better.''
   ``Our principles are clear _ that government service is a noble
calling and a public trust,'' Bush said.
   The president noted that he had appointed a commission Wednesday
to recommend new ethics reform proposals for all three branches of
government, indicating he wants to avoid the kinds of ethical
problems that often hounded the Reagan administration.
   Bush asked the eight-member advisory commission to come up with
recommendations for ethics legislation by March 9.

   In naming the President's Commission on Federal Ethics Law
Reform, Bush said he wants a ``code of conduct to ensure that those
who serve the public trust avoid any actual or apparent conflict
between their personal and public interests.''
   The president said, however, the standards should not be so
``unreasonably restrictive'' that they dissuade capable people from
entering government.
   Last fall, President Reagan vetoed a congressional ethics
package, saying it was excessive and would hamper the government's
ability to attract top-rate people.
   Bush supported the veto, saying at the time that would put
together his own ethics reforms.
   ``Current federal ethics rules do not adequately serve to
eliminate use of public funds for private gains,'' Bush said
Wednesday.
   ``The current framework is fragmented, confusing and, most
important, it does not incorporate sufficient safeguards to protect
the public interest in an honest and fair government.''
   The panel is chaired by Griffin Bell, the former attorney general
in the Carter administration, and Malcolm Wilkey, a senior judge on
the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.
   Besides Bell and Wilkey, other panel members are former White
House counsels Fred Fielding and Lloyd Cutler, Washington attorney
Jan Baran who is counsel to the Republican National Committee,
former Rep. Harrison Schmitt of New Mexico, former counsel to the
Senate Armed Services Committee R. James Woolsey, and Judith Bello,
former counsel to the U.S. Trade Representative's office.

   The prices Americans pay for imported goods
resumed their upward trend in the final three months of 1988 to post
a 4.1 percent increase for the year, the government said Thursday.
   The Labor Department said import prices rose 1.6 percent from
October through December after falling 1.3 percent in the third
quarter. That had been their first decline in more than two years.
   The fourth-quarter increase was moderated by a drop in the cost
of crude oil and other imported fuels, which decreased 7.8 percent
after plunging 9.0 percent in the previous three months.
   From October through December, prices for imported crude
materials rose by 5.5 percent, imported machinery costs were up 2.5
percent, intermediate manufacturing products gained 2.4 percent and
chemical prices increased 2.3 percent.
   Removing the big drop in energy prices, all other imported goods
registered a 2.4 percent increase over the previous quarter.
   Last year's increase in import prices and a 10 percent rise
during the previous year were linked to the weakening of the U.S.
dollar, which fell in value by 2.6 percent in 1988 and 13.6 percent
in the previous year, according to a trade-weighted index used by
the Labor Department.
   The fall of the dollar, while improving the price competitiveness
of U.S. goods overseas and helping to lower the U.S. trade deficit,
also has the effect of boosting the prices of foreign goods bought
in the United States.
   The higher import costs affect inflation of consumer prices
overall, which rose 4.4 percent in 1988 and by a like margin during
the previous year.
   The price of U.S. exports, meanwhile, fell 0.2 percent during the
fourth quarter but still stood 6.3 percent higher than a year
earlier.
   The biggest decrease in export prices in the fourth quarter
occurred in the food category, which dropped 3.8 percent after
shooting up 14.8 percent in the previous quarter due to the summer
drought.

   Pinky Lee, the baggy-pants vaudeville comic
who starred in a children's TV show in the 1950s, was listed in
serious but stable condition today after suffering a heart attack
backstage during a musical.
   Lee was resting comfortably and is expected to remain
hospitalized for up to 14 days, said St. Francis Medical Center
spokeswoman Theresa Staley.
   Lee was stricken during a performance of ``Sugar Babies'' at the
Peoria Civic Center Theater. His age was not immediately available.
   The former burlesque comic, born Pincus Leff, starred in ``The
Pinky Lee Show'' on NBC in 1950 and 1954-56.
   Wearing a rolled-brim hat and a loud, checkered coat, he danced,
told stories and introduced himself by singing, ``Hello, it's me. My
name is Pinky Lee.'' Comeback attempts in the late 1950s and
mid-'60s were unsuccessful.

   An American Airlines jet with 97 people aboard
made an emergency landing at O'Hare International Airport today
after an indicator light falsely warned of an engine fire, officials
said. No one was injured.
   The twin-engine McDonnell Douglas Super-80 en route to Chicago
from Indianapolis reported the emergency 53 miles from Chicago, the
airline said.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mort Edelstein said the
light came on after a ``blown duct pump'' forced hot air into the
engine compartment, activating fire warnings and prompting the pilot
to set off fire extinguishers.
   The emergency light then went out, said American spokesman Tom
Stack.
   The Super-80 is a longer version of the DC-9, said American
spokeswoman Mary O'Neill.

<TEXT>
   Former President Chun Doo-hwan on
Thursday defied the National Assembly, refusing to testify on his
role in the army's suppression of an uprising in 1980.
   About 500 radical students from several Seoul colleges clashed
with riot police Thursday at Dongguk University to demand the arrest
of Chun and President Roh Tae-woo, a former ally who has distanced
him from Chun. Radicals hurled hundreds of firebombs and rocks at
police surrounding the school.
   No serious injuries or arrests were reported.
   Officials took the order issued by the National Assembly to the
remote east coast Buddhist temple where Chun is living, but the
former president refused it, risking prosecution.
   Instead, he issued a statement accepting moral responsibility for
the civilian uprising in Kwangju.
   ``I think I was in a position to take moral and political
responsibility (for Kwangju), so I have no intention to avoid
responsibility,'' Chun said.
   He has said he will answer questions from lawmakers without
appearing, and Thursday he said he would testify ``indirectly.''
   Chun has denied any personal wrongdoing. However, he went into
rural exile after surrendering assets worth $24 million and
apologizing to the nation last November for abuses during his
administration. Several members of the ex-president's family have
been arrested or convicted on corruption charges.
   Former President Choi Kyu-ha, who briefly held office as a
figurehead before Chun took power with military backing in 1980,
also refused to accept an order to testify after officials took it
to his Seoul home.
   By official count, about 200 people were killed and more than
1,000 injured when the army put down the uprising in Kwangju.
Opposition groups claim the casualty toll was much higher, and the
uprising remains a highly emotional and controversial issue.
   Chun, a former general, was in control of the armed forces at the
time and took power of the government a few months later.
   The orders to testify were issued after a special Assembly
committee investigating the uprising resumed hearings in Seoul. The
Assembly is investigating allegations of widespread human rights
abuses and corruption under Chun.
   Both former presidents said previously that, as former heads of
state, they cannot compelled to testify. Roh has backed Chun's
refusal to testify.
   Under Korean law, the parliamentary committee has the power to
refer the case to prosecutors for legal action. But they must then
decide whether to act.
   The opposition is not expected to press immediately for Chun's
prosecution because keeping the issue alive furthers its political
aims.
   If convicted, the former presidents could be sentenced to up to
five years in prison.
   Chun is also being pressed to testify before another
parliamentary committee investigating corruption and other misdeeds.
Chun stepped down in February after a seven-year term and was
replaced by Roh, who won presidential elections in December 1987.
   The opposition is trying to use the Kwangju incident and other
legacies of the authoritarian Chun government to weaken the Roh
government. Roh is still identified with Chun in the eyes of many
Koreans.
   Opposition parties demanded this week that Roh keep an election
promise to submit to a referendum on his administration.

   A hearing on a zoning change that would let
unmarried couples live in neighborhoods they had previously been
excluded from has stirred impassioned debate on both sides.
   The Denver City Council has scheduled a public hearing and debate
for Monday night on a proposed zoning law change that would allow
two unrelated adults to live in single family residences, even in
areas with the exclusive ``R-0'' zoning.
   Although there are believed to be hundreds of violators, two
people who are not related may not live legally in the restrictive
R-0 zones, covering 8 percent of the city's single-family homes.
   Neighborhoods across the city have been papered with leaflets by
residents who say the zoning change will destroy the quality of life
by bringing in more people to formerly quiet neighborhoods and
hurting property values.
   Many real estate agents, on the other hand, say the zoning change
would not hurt property values and might in some cases help them.
   ``It will improve the marketability of some homes,'' said Bob
Egan, a broker with ReMax Cherry Creek, by making more people
eligible to buy homes in single-family areas.
   Carol Ihli, a broker with Coldwell Banker and chairwoman of the
Denver Board of Realtors public affairs committee, said she didn't
think it would affect property values. The board opted against
taking a stand on the zoning change.
   The law is now under legal attack, and the city's lawyers are not
sure if it will survive judicial review.
   Councilman Dave Doering has proposed the change, which he says is
a compromise that will allow unmarried couples as well as others to
share houses. He said many elderly residents who are widowed prefer
to live with others for economic and social reasons.

   Managers of Elvis Presley's estate say they
have settled a lawsuit against a former Presley aide who sold home
movies of the singer.
   Lawyers for the estate and former Presley aide Joe Esposito
declined to discuss details of the settlement, but the agreement
reached Wednesday gives the estate clear ownership of the movies,
said Rogers &amp; Cowan Inc., the estate's public relations firm.
   Esposito has said he earned about $23,000 from sales of a
43-minute videotape of home movies of Presley, his family and
friends filmed between 1962 and 1968. Esposito later sold the movies
on the open market.
   Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc., the company that handles the
estate's multimillion-dollar marketing business, filed a lawsuit
against Esposito in 1987 to block sales of his videotape.
   Presley died of heart disease in 1977 at his Memphis residence
called Graceland. The house and its nearby souvenir shopping center
draw more than a half-million tourists a year.

<HEAD>Government Keeps Erosion Fight as a Top Agriculture Goal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reducing the amount of soil lost from the
nation's farmland through water and wind erosion will remain as the
top goal of federal soil and water conservation agencies through
1997, an Agriculture Department report said Thursday.
   ``Erosion control remains the top priority because, of all the
problems addressed by USDA conservation programs, erosion is the
most widespread threat to long-term agricultural productivity and
environmental quality,'' the report said.
   Erosion is outpacing soil replenishment, passing the
``tolerance'' level accepted by most conservationists, on an
estimated 277 million acres of non-federal rural land _ more than
California and Texas combined.
   ``About 173 million of these acres are cropland, on which erosion
was 2.3 billion tons in 1982,'' the report said. ``If left
unchecked, erosion will reduce the ability of the soil to produce
needed food and fiber.''
   Further, it said, the silt from eroded soil can damage land, air
and water. Total costs are virtually impossible to pinpoint, but one
study estimates that water erosion alone costs the nation $3 billion
to $13 billion each year.
   The new report updates the department's National Conservation
Program developed in 1982 in response to the Soil and Water
Resources Conservation Act of 1977. The law, or RCA, required
long-range conservation planning by the department for programs
affecting soil and water conservation on non-federal lands.
   Assistant Secretary George Dunlop said that the protection of
water quality ranks with erosion abatement in the Agriculture
Department's list of priorities. In 1982, he said, the priorities
were erosion control, and water conservation and upstream flood
control.
   Dunlop said additional areas that have come in for greater
consideration in recent years include the expansion of
``conservation partnership'' with states, local government's and
landowners; working with small-scale, poorer and minority farmers;
improving the consistency of programs, and cutting costs.
   Conditions have changed markedly since the 1977 law was passed,
the report said. At that time the prices of agricultural commodities
and the volume of exports were increasing.
   ``Famine was stalking many countries, and reports of world
resource degradation were increasing,'' the report said. ``Adding to
the concern was a perception that technology, which had provided
continuous increases in agricultural productivity for decades, was
not likely to provide similar increases in the future.''
   But in the early 1980s, the situation sharply reversed, with a
drop in world demand, a global recession and serious debt problems
in many importing countries. At the same time, world agricultural
production was rising, and surpluses grew.
   One result was renewed attention to conservation and the 1977
law's process for looking ahead to solving soil and water problems,
the report said.
   The 1985 farm law included authorization of the Conservation
Reserve Program, or CRP, which enables farmers to take highly
erodible land from crop production for 10 years and protect it with
grass and tree plantings.
   Congress set a goal of 40 million to 45 million acres in the CRP
by the end of 1990. About 28.2 million acres have been enrolled in
the program.
   According to the report, the CRP already has had a major impact
on erosion and is currently saving 530 million tons of soil
annually. By 1995, it said, the fully operational CRP is expected to
save 800 million tons of soil per year, thus reducing total U.S.
erosion losses on non-federal land by 15 percent.
   Robert J. Gray, policy director for the private, non-profit
American Farmland Trust, said the USDA figures on saving soil are
impressive but that ``no one has been able to really spot check the
fields'' to determine if the claims are correct.

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge, colorful fireball spotted over
Oregon and Washington probably was a meteor _ and it may have struck
the earth, officials said.
   The object was reported to the Coast Guard by a motorcyclist on a
coastal highway about 1:30 p.m. Wednesday. Dozens of people from the
Oregon coast to south-central Washington also reported seeing it,
some giving earlier times.
   ``It just came right out of the sky,'' said Rod Ragsdale of
Portland, ``this big ball with blue flames and green flames and red
flames.''
   Bruce Spainhower, an official at the Oregon Museum of Science and
Industry, said the reports appeared to describe a bolide, a huge
meteor that fails to burn up completely in the atmosphere.
   If descriptions of it are accurate, Spainhower said, it is quite
possible the meteor landed in eastern Washington. Most meteors _
often called ``shooting stars'' _ range in size from a pea to a
walnut and burn up in the atmosphere, he said.
   The object was not man-made, but nothing further was immediately
known, said Maj. Alex Mondragon of the North American Air Defense
command in Colorado Springs, Colo., which tracks space debris
falling to earth.
   Witnesses described the fireball as traveling from west to east,
plainly visibith round gold buttons
and nipped slightly at the waist.
   Cocktail dresses were a little sexier, with belted or draped
waists, side slits and plunging necklines. Again, the shirtwaist
style, but updated with gold metal braiding and appliques outlining
hems and lower sleeves.
   There were plenty of dresses for hot summer nights and the
schoolmarm daytime look loosened up with pretty floral motifs and
geometric patterns in gauze, crepe and chiffon.
   Givenchy excelled at evening wear, serving up a myriad of colors
and styles. There were organza sheaths and chiffon dresses with
embroidery recalling sea grottoes, along with bustiers of pearl and
porcelaine. One mousseline bustier dress looked like an Indian sari.
   Per Spook also showed on Thursday, presenting a collection based
on the comfort and versatility of wide-legged pajama pants that
covered the foot and brushed the floor.
   His models, in tie-up or sling-back flats most of the time, wore
pants under everything from layers of silk jackets to
off-the-shoulder, ruffled shirts.
   Muted greens, sandy beiges, khaki and camel and burnished oranges
dominated Spook's color palette for daytime wear, but they exploded
into shimmering blues, reds, greens and oranges for evening. Silk
crepe jackets and tuniques, topping orange and yellow silk pants,
were embroidered with sequins and tiny mirrors and emblazoned with
dragons.
   Spook also presented an array of skirts, conventional and
wrap-around, with asymetrical hemlines. Most hit the knee but some
dropped to the less seen midcalf.
   Spook's wedding dress in blue, white and red was a salute to this
year's bicentennial celebrations of the French Revolution. Inspired
by the low-necked, corseted look popular two centuries ago, the
dress _ in silk taffeta _ was puffed up by tricolor petticoats and
set off with ruffles and a big bustle.

<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary-designate Manuel Lujan Jr.
said today that the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt _ ``The
country will not be a good place to live in unless it is a good
place for all of us to live in'' _ will motivate his actions if he
is confirmed.
   At a confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, Lujan said he sees the job as one of
``stewardship,'' and said he hopes to enlist thousands of volunteers
as helpers in the national park and fish and wildlife systems.
   ``We want to be known as a team who passed on these national
treasures in better condition than we found them,'' he said.
   A native of New Mexico, Lujan grew up on lands that are now an
Indian reservation. As interior secretary he would oversee the
Bureau of Indian Affairs and, in response to a question, said he
would become personally involved if he heard of any Native Americans
being treated insensitively.
   Lujan outlined several specific points he called his agenda for
the Interior Department position.
   ``I will be an aggressive soldier on the war on drugs,'' he said.
He also said he has plans to provide work study and stay-in-school
programs for employees of the department.
   Lujan, 60, served in the House 20 years before retiring last
year. From 1981 to 1985, he was the ranking Republican on the House
Interior Committee and was mentioned twice in the past as a possible
choice for interior secretary.
   The full Senate plans to vote on Lujan's nomination next
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   A house painter ended his lonely vigil
atop a 20-foot-high downtown water fountain after 42{ days and after
raising less than $1,000 for the homeless, far short of his goal of
$1 million.
   But David Oferosky said Wednesday it was worth the effort.
   ``I'm proud of what I did, and I would do it again,'' he said.
   Oferosky, 34, began his vigil at 11:20 p.m. Dec. 13, scrambling
up a ladder to his campsite atop the concrete fountain and into a
tan tent pitched on a plywood floor.
   A portable toilet stood outside the tent, next to a propane flame
that Oferosky said symbolized his vigil and a bare evergreen tree
that was his only Christmas decoration.
   Inside, he had a cot, sleeping bag, kerosene lamp and small
propane heater, which he said he used only occasionally.
   A cellular telephone kept him in contact with the outside world.
For entertainment, he had a television that eventually burned out, a
radio, books and magazines and a mini-trampoline.
   Oferosky said he suffered chills some nights and the pain of an
abscessed tooth, but mostly he fought boredom and loneliness.
   ``You do have a lot of time to think, believe me,'' he said.
``It's like, `This is it, your coffee's not gonna get no hotter.
You've read that book? Read it again!' I never thought of giving
up.''
   Pas  ``It was bad when the gangs were shooting each other, but when
they start attacking innoncent people, it's time for people to do
something,'' said DeLen McRae, 44, an associate minister at St.
James' Baptist Church in Norwalk.
   The McRaes and their 17-year-old son were in back bedrooms of the
apartment, and no injuries were reported. But bullets pierced
windows, walls, furniture and even McRae's clergy robe, which was
hanging in a doorway.
   The incident remained under investigation.

<HEAD>Bush to Visit China Next Month After Hirohito Funeral</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, who served as envoy to China
during the rule of Mao Zedong, will spend two days in Beijing next
month after visiting Japan and may extend his travels to other
countries, the White House said Thursday.
   There was speculation South Korea also would be on his itinerary.
   ``I don't have full dates of the trip yet in terms of starting
and ending but it's clearly in an expanding mode here,'' said White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``I can't say for certain
but this is not the final parameters of the trip.''
   On his first overseas trip, Bush will travel to Japan for the
Feb. 24 funeral of Emperor Hirohito. He will spend Feb. 25-26 in
China on a working visit, which traditionally has less pomp and
ceremony than a full-blown state visit.
   Fitzwater left open the possibility Bush would confer in Tokyo
with other foreign leaders.
   ``Obviously when a president goes to these kinds of events there
are opportunities for bilateral meetings and obviously there are a
lot of countries who would like to have them, but we have to
consider the time constraints involved in moving around _ in this
case moving on to China and protocol restraints associated with the
funeral,'' Fitzwater said.
   Describing the purpose of stopping in China, Fitzwater said it
was ``essentially to reaffirm our relationship, to offer support as
they inch towards some openness in their society and some moves of
economic reforms.
   He said Bush will meet with senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
   ``The president of course has very close ties with China, having
served there and having made two trips to China as vice president,''
Fitzwater said. ``It just makes sense that while he has gone that
far in that part of the world that he also stop in and pay a visit
to China.''
   Fitzwater said there was no slight to the Soviet Union in Bush's
decision to visit Beijing before he goes to Moscow.
   ``The president has given every assurance of our continued
cooperation toward the Soviet Union,'' Fitzwater said, noting that
one of Bush's first telephone calls from the Oval Office was to
President Mikhail Gorbachev. ``There should be no inferences or
special signals to the contrary.''
   The spokesman said Bush ``has often said he will be prepared to
meet with Gorbachev when the time is ripe, when they've completed
the foreign policy reviews that are necessary and when he (Bush)
think's it's appropriate.''
   In 1974, Bush surprised then-President Gerald Ford by asking to
serve as envoy to China instead of accepting an ambassadorship in
Britain or France. ``An important, coveted post like London or Paris
would be good for the resume, but Beijing was a challenge, a journey
into the unknown,'' Bush wrote later in his autobiography.
   A little more than a year after taking the post, Bush was tapped
to become director of the CIA. During his entire stay in Beijing,
Bush saw Mao only twice, once during a meeting with then-Secretary
of State Henry A. Kissinger and again during a state visit by Ford.

<HEAD>Mother Accused of Forcing Children Into Prostitution; Grandmother
Sought</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother was arraigned Thursday on
charges of drugging her 9-year-old son and forcing him and his
12-year-old sister into prostitution with as many as 80 adults.
   Police sought the children's grandmother, a 48-year-old Concord
woman, on a warrant charging her with pandering in the same case.
   Authorities believe the mother, a 29-year-old El Cerrito woman,
used money collected for the sex acts to buy drugs, police Lt. Ray
Howard said. Neither the mother nor the grandmother were identified
by name in order to protect the children.
   A guardian whom the children live with called police last week
and reported they had been forced to prostitute themselves while the
family lived in Richmond from 1986 to 1988, Howard said.
   The children said their mother gave them marijuana, alcohol,
sleeping pills, cocaine and methamphetamine in an effort to
desensitize them to the sex acts, Howard said.
   The boy told investigators that his mother forced him to have sex
with 20 women, and the girl said she was forced to have sex with 60
men.
   The mother is charged with 16 felony counts of forcing the
children into lewd and lascivious acts, two counts of pandering
children for sex and one count of supplying crack cocaine to her son.
   The thin woman with stringy, shoulder-length hair appeared
nervous when appearing before Bay Municipal Court Judge Allen
Norris, and said she did not have money to hire a lawyer. Norris
referred her to the Public Defender's Office.
   The judge set her next court date for Feb. 2, and ordered her to
remain at the county jail in Martinez with no bail. He also sealed
the court records.
   The woman has no previous criminal history, said Deputy District
Attorney Brandon Baum.
   Baum said he has prosecuted other parents for prostituting their
children, but this case is different.
   ``I would say it's unusual based on the business-like manner in
which the acts took place. ... It was not a haphazard type of
thing,'' he said, adding there were no signs that the mother took
any precautions to protect the children's physical health or guard
them against sexually transmitted disease.
   According to Baum, the grandmother allegedly ``aided and abetted
in making arrangements for the acts to take place.'' Most occurred
at the family home.
   ``There are still a lot of unanswered questions about the
grandmother ... her role here,'' Howard said.
   Authorities first investigated the mother in May after an alleged
molestation of the girl. There is a $25,000 warrant outstanding for
the arrest of the 33-year-old man suspected in that case.
   The county's Child Protective Services took the brother and
sister away from their mother because of neglect concerns and placed
them in a foster home, Howard said.
   Two other girls, ages 2 and 4, were taken from the home shortly
after the May incident, authorities said.
   Officials believe the children's father was not involved in the
alleged prostitution and wasn't living with them at the time, Howard
said.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Whines About Warm Weather</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Springlike temperatures in the land of ice and
snow have connoisseurs of cold whining and organizers of this
weekend's winter festival rejiggering their schedules.
   ``In the 40s!'' moaned Wendell Howard, a longtime Waukesha
resident who came Thursday to watch the U.S. International Snow
Sculpting Competition, a key part of the Icebreaker Winter Funfest.
``Now, that's not Wisconsin in the winter, especially not in
January.''
   ``Oh, we like something more around zero or 20 below _ at least
for a couple of weeks in January,'' he said.
   Some of the world's top snow sculpting teams were here for the
festival, which was preceded by rain and mild temperatures. Luckily,
Icebreaker fest organizers, thinking ahead, saved huge blocks of
snow from a late-December storm.
   According to the National Weather Service, the average
temperature in Milwaukee for January was 28.6 degrees through
Wednesday, about 10 degrees above normal. The mercury hasn't dipped
below zero in Milwaukee once this winter, the weather service said.
   Snowfall so far this winter was 12.5 inches, only about a quarter
of the normal total for the season, and no one expects the shortfall
to be made up by the end of winter.
   The snow sculpting contest, now in its fourth year, draws
thousands of spectators to gaze at the often highly detailed
creations, most more than 8 feet tall, made from 10-ton blocks of
snow.
   Because of the warm weather, Icebreaker fest organizers are
recommending sculptors work at night when temperatures are lower.
They also ordered wood chips to cover the muddied grounds, and moved
ice-sculpting events to a refrigerated ice house.
   The snow-sculpting compeition event has drawn teams from 10
countries.
   ``Well, I was all psyched up about coming here. Coming from
England where it is usually a lot milder, I expected to see lots of
snow and some cold temperatures. But so far it's just like being
back home,'' said Ron Dutton, of Wolverhampton, England, a member of
the three-man British team.
   Dutton, who worked Thursday on his team's sculpture, said rain
Wednesday and the weather made sculpting his 10-ton block of snow
difficult. Competitors complain that the month-old blocks of snow
are soft on the inside and brittle on the outside.
   Karin Bach, of the Canadian women's team, said the rain was
changing sculptors' strategy.
   ``A lot of people will hold back on their details until Friday
night, especially with this weather,'' she said.
   ``All the sculptors were inside, you know. Everyone looked really
dejected, really disappointed,'' she said Thursday. ``But we're all
back today and we'll still have some excellent works no matter what
the weather.''
   Gene Kempfer, director of the snow sculpting competition, said
the forecast for spring-like temperatures this weekend forced him to
move up the time of the judging a few hours Saturday so that judges
could see the finished products before the sun began melting them.

<HEAD>Government Says Campbell's Deceives on Soups' Health Benefits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission accused Campbell
Soup Co. on Thursday of deceiving its customers by advertising its
soups as good for the heart without also advertising their salt
content.
   The commission requested an order from an administrative law
judge requiring Campbell's to say in its ads how much sodium a soup
contains if the company makes any claim that the soup can fight
heart disease.
   According to William MacLeod, director of the commission's Bureau
of Consumer Protection, Campbell's contended without substantiation
that its soups, as part of a diet low in fat and cholesterol, may
help reduce the risk of some forms of heart disease.
   MacLeod singled out a two-page magazine ad used in the winter of
1987-1988, but not used since, that said Campbell's soups were high
in fiber, high in calcium when made with milk, and low in fat and
cholesterol.
   ``A serving of regular Chicken Noodle, or new Special Request
with one-third less salt, is low in fat and has just 15 milligrams
of cholesterol. And that's especially good to know, because research
tells us that a diet low in fat and cholesterol may help reduce the
risk of some forms of heart disease,'' the ad said.
   MacLeod said, ``What we want them to do is, when they make that
claim, to disclose that the product has sodium because sodium has
been associated with heart disease and certainly hypertension,''
high blood pressure.
   At the company's headquarters in Camden, N.J., Campbell's
spokesman David Hackney said, ``We stand behind our advertising and
we don't think it's misleading,'' because every can lists the sodium
content, ``all five billion of them.''
   ``We are the only major manufacturer that does that,'' he said.
``We feel we can substantiate through experts that a diet low in fat
and low in cholesterol can reduce the risk of certain forms of heart
disease.''
   In the trial before the administrative law judge, the company
will present experts ``who will discuss the whole salt issue'' and
contest the commission's linkage of salt and high blood pressure,
Hackney said.
   MacLeod, the FTC official, said the commission was not trying to
make advertisers disclose all shortcomings of their products, only
attributes that undermine their claims and thus constitute deception
when omitted.
   ``If they don't advertise the heart-healthiness of the soup, this
order wouldn't come into play,'' he said.
   Not counting such variations as its ``Chunky'' line or its two
kinds of low-sodium soups, Campbell's makes 70 different condensed
soups in the familiar red-and-white cans.
   Soups that contain more than 500 milligrams of sodium per
eight-ounce serving would come under the commission's proposed order.
   That would include, according to labels on the cans, such soups
as turkey vegetable at 710 milligrams and chicken noodle at 910
milligrams of sodium, a part of sodium chloride, ordinary table salt.
   Campbell's has an estimated two-thirds of the $2.2 billion market
for soups sold in stores.
   Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science and the Public
Interest, which petitioned the commission 11 months ago to act
against not only the fat and cholesterol claim in the ad but also
the fiber and calcium claims, said, ``We're happy the agency has
responded,'' but disappointed that the other claims were not also
the subject of federal complaints.
   He said the government action means ``it's fair to say anything
with 500 milligrams (per serving) is a high-sodium food. ... We're
happy with'' the choice of 500 milligrams as a threshold.
   Not all doctors accept the proposition that salt, at commonly
found concentrations in U.S. diets, increases blood pressure.
Studies show many people maintain normal blood pressure while eating
varying amounts of salt while others, for unknown reasons, seem
``salt sensitive'' and their blood pressure can soar when salt
intake goes up.
   MacLeod, acknowledging the dispute, said the commission would
rely heavily on the surgeon general's 1988 ``Report on Nutrition and
Health,'' which said diets high in sodium ``clearly contribute'' to
high blood pressure.

<HEAD>Inquiry Largely Clears Controversial TV Film on Shootings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Filmmakers who outraged the government with their
TV documentary on the shooting of three unarmed Irish guerrilla
suspects were cleared Thursday by an inquiry into allegations of
unscrupulous journalism.
   The inquiry found the documentary flawed on two counts, but
concluded the filmmakers fully satisfied ``the requirements of
balance, fairness and impartiality.''
   The government said it continued to believe the documentary
contained ``many serious and damaging inaccuracies,'' and in a
demonstration of its displeasure took the unusual step of publishing
the points it made behind closed doors to the inquiry.
   John Wakeham, majority leader in Parliament, noted that an
inquest had ruled the killings were lawful, and said of the
inquiry's report: ``The government profoundly disagrees with it.''
   ``Death on the Rock'' was broadcast seven weeks after the
shooting of the unarmed suspects by a British anti-terrorist squad
last March in Gibraltar, and provoked uproar by strongly suggesting
that Mairead Farrell, Sean Savage and Daniel McCann were gunned down
without getting a chance to surrender.
   The government said the three were planting a car bomb in the
British colony, and the Irish Republican Army acknowledged that the
two men and one woman were in Gibraltar ``on active service.''
   But the fact that they were unarmed, and that no car bomb turned
up, provoked alarm that the security forces were taking too much
latitude in the struggle against IRA terrorism.
   The Foreign Office appealed to the Independent Broadcasting
Authority, which governs commercial TV, to suppress the documentary
as prejudicial to the inquest. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
publicly denounced it, saying: ``If ever you get trial by television
or guilt by accusation, that day freedom dies.''
   Since then, Amnesty International has demanded a judicial inquiry
into the killings and civil libertarians said the attack on the film
is part of a broader government assault on media freedom.
   When Kenneth Asquez, the source of one of the film's most
provocative claims retracted his story under questioning at the
inquest, filmmaker Thames Television initiated the inquiry by Lord
Windlesham and senior attorney Richard Rampton.
   Windlesham is a former member of Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative
Party government and Rampton specializes in defamation law. Thames
said they were ``independent assessors'' with impeccable credentials
that have not been challenged from any quarter during their
four-month inquiry.
   Asquez, a Gibraltar bank clerk, claimed he was bullied and
offered money for a statement that he saw a security man standing
over McCann's body pumping bullets into his head.
   The investigators said viewers should have been told Asquez's
statement was unfilmed and unsigned. But they did not fault its
inclusion in the documentary and said the journalists ``did not
bribe, bully or misrepresent'' witnesses.
   The other criticism was of an ``inappropriately worded'' line of
commentary that the inquiry did not believe ``arose from any lack of
scrupulousness.'' The film said four witnesses saw the squad fire
without warning, whereas one witness was not in a position to see.
It had four witnesses saying the suspects made no sudden movements,
whereas two were not in a position to know that.
   The inquiry rejected about 20 other allegations, such as that the
filmmakers knowingly broadcast falsehoods, had preconceived
theories, sympathized with the IRA and wanted to pin a murder charge
on the British unit.
   The government called it ``irresponsible to the point of
dishonesty'' to include Asquez's story in the film, and pointed to
other contradictions between the film's narrative and evidence heard
at the inquest.
   The film said the suspects were under surveillance before
entering Gibraltar, and that Savage's car could have been stopped at
the border, said the government. The inquest heard otherwise.
   A witness told the filmmakers she saw plainclothed men jump from
a police car and shoot two suspects. The inquest heard the car
arrived after the shooting and contained uniformed policemen.
   A government statement said the reporters ``failed to pursue the
truth, to clarify the facts or to present evidence impartially.''
   The inquiry upheld the government's right ``to make the strongest
possible representations'' against programs deemed ``harmful to the
public interest.''
   But the broadcasting authority, ``must be prepared to withstand
pressure, however fierce and whatever the source,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   The admiral who led the official
investigation into last year's downing of an Iranian jetliner by a
U.S. Navy cruiser has been chosen as the next commander of the
American naval force in the Persian Gulf.
   Pentagon officials said this week Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty
will probably assume command of the Joint Task Force Middle East in
March. He will replace Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less, who will join the
plans, policy and operations staff of the Chief of Naval Operations.
   The force includes 24 warships _ 14 in the gulf and a 10-ship
aircraft carrier battle group in the Arabian Sea.
   The appointment is the second top-level command shuffle in recent
months.
   In November, Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf succeeded retiring
Marine Gen. George B. Crist at U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Fla.
   Central Command is the administrative headquarters for U.S.
military affairs in 19 countries of the Middle East, including the
gulf region.
   Schwarzkopf is currently on a tour of the region. He conferred
Wednesday with senior government officials and Bahrain and also
planned to meet with the emir, Sheik Isa Bin Salman Al Khalifa.
   Fogarty, 51, a surface warfare officer, is director of plans and
policy at Central Command.
   He headed the team of experts that investigated the shooting down
of an Iran Air jet July 3 by the missile cruiser USS Vincennes in
the Strait of Hormuz.
   All 290 people aboard were killed when the warship destroyed the
jetliner in the belief it was an Iranian jet fighter.
   Fogarty's inquiry found the stress of first-time combat caused
some Vincennes crew members to misinterpret radar data on the jet.
   The gulf-based force was recently cut from 15 to 14 ships in a
move that U.S. officials said reflected a lowering of tension since
Iraq and Iran since they signed a cease-fire in August in their
8-year-old war.
   The United States has maintained a permanent naval force in the
Persian Gulf since 1949, but it was expanded in 1987 to protect
U.S.-flag shipping.
   Navy ships now only monitor U.S.-flag vessels from a distance,
and six of 11 Kuwaiti tankers that have sailed under the Stars and
Stripes since mid-1987 will soon revert to Kuwaiti registry.

   A burglary suspect injured by police during
a chase failed to show up in court after apparently cutting off his
plaster body cast and leaving town on crutches, police said.
   The cast incased the man from ankles to mid-trunk, Sandusky
County Jail Administrator Robert Pollard said Thursday.
   ``It was a full-body cast because he had a pin in his femur,''
the bone extending from hip to knee, said Pollard. ``It was designed
to immobilize him.''
   The suspect, Robert Chavez, 19, was last seen Saturday at his
mobile home, where he was recuperating from a broken hip and other
injuries incurred when police shot him in the left leg and left
buttocks during a chase Nov. 21, said Sheriff David Gangwer.
   Chavez was indicted on five counts of aggravated burglary and one
count of felonious assault, court records showed. Detectives went
looking for him after he failed to show up for a court hearing
Tuesday, Gangwer said.
   Doctors told authorities in December Chavez would have to wear
the cast until March, said Gangwer.
   But a resident of Chavez's mobile home park told authorities he
found a discarded body cast in a trash bin about two weeks ago, the
sheriff said, adding that a pair of crutches was missing from the
mobile home park.
   ``We're looking for a guy on crutches that's moving like a
mole,'' said a sheriff's detective who did not give his name.

<TEXT>
   Army troops razed or sealed seven Palestinian
houses Thursday to try to quell the Arab uprising, and Jewish
settlers said they would punish stone-throwers themselves because
the army wasn't doing its job.
   ``We are not satisfied with the security situation, even with the
new decisions,'' said settler official Uri Ariel, referring to the
army's tough, new policy that includes firing plastic bullets at
fleeing rioters or protesters blocking roads.
   Elyakim Haetzni, another settler leader, said settlers would
begin making their own arrests of Palestinians and might shoot at
those who stone Jewish cars in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   In the occupied lands Thursday, soldiers shot and wounded 12
youths in clashes with stone-throwers and shut down two schools
where rocks were thrown, Arab reporters and hospital officials said.
   The army said it had reports of four shooting injuries in Gaza
and the West Bank city of Nablus, and was checking other reports.
   It also reported troops demolished five houses in the West Bank
that belonged to families of Palestinian suspects in firebomb
attacks on Israeli cars or soldiers.
   Four homes were bulldozed in the village of Aqraba, one was blown
up in Tulkarem, and one house also was sealed in each of the two
places, an army spokeswoman said.
   In Tulkarem, she said, two soldiers were wounded in a firebomb
attack in September. The two-story house razed there belonged to
Mohammed Haloub, who has had one son deported during the 13-month
Palestinian uprising and three other sons jailed, Arab reports said.
   The United States and human rights organizations have criticized
such house destructions, saying they violate international law
because the suspects are not tried.
   Israeli officials maintain that house demolitions are legal. They
are carried out under emegency laws adopted by the British rulers of
mandatory Palestine in 1945 when Jews were fighting for the right to
establish their own state.
   An army official said Wednesday that more than 200 Palestinian
homes have been demolished or sealed during the uprising.
   Last week, officials announced that house demolitions _
previously used for firebomb suspects _ could now be directed
against suspects in stone-throwing attacks that caused damage or
injury.
   The move was included in measures introduced in a renewed effort
to stop the ``intefadeh,'' the Arabic word for ``uprising'' that is
used for the revolt against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   At least 369 Palestinians have been killed in the rebellion, most
by army gunfire. Fifteen Israelis also have died.
   The growing casualty rate has brought criticism of the army from
left-wing Israelis, and left-wing groups began a weekend protest
against jailing of Palestinians without trial by setting up a tent
camp outside the Ketziot prison in southern Israel.
   Abraham Hess, a survivor of the Nazi Holocaust taking part in the
protest, said on Israeli radio that harsh actions against
Palestinians were humiliating Israel.
   ``You cannot forget that we were expelled from our own homes,''
he said. ``We must stop this blood. This Palestinian nation wants to
live just as we did.''
   In Jerusalem, officials of the settler movement Gush Emunim, or
``Bloc of the Faithful,'' told reporters they would act against the
uprising on their own since a 43-day fast by eight settlers failed
to gain stronger army actions.
   ``We sent out an SOS to the government that people were
considering taking actions into their own hands,'' Haetzni said.
``So we are no longer responsible for what happens.''
   He said the settlers sought legal advice and believed they had
the right to arrest and in some cases shoot Palestinian
stone-throwers.
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in enclaves among the 1.7
million Palestinian residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which
were captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The Defense Ministry confirmed, meanwhile, that the army soon
will release prominent PLO activist Faisal Husseini, who has been
held without trial or specific charges for most of the past 21
months.
   Husseini, who was was arrested in July and ordered held for six
months, reportedly supports elections in the occupied lands if they
are not linked to autonomy.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin has called for elections as a way
to start the peace process, but a spokesman for Rabin said
Husseini's release is not connected to his views on elections.
   Rabin's plan called for elections and autonomy, which have
repeatedly been rejected by the PLO as inconsistent with its demand
for indepedence.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir also turned down Rabin's plan, and
he said Thursday no peace negotiations could begin until the
Palestinian uprising ends.
   ``I think there should be no infefadeh. It is not important how
it stops,'' he said in northern Israel. ``When it is quiet, there
will be negotiations.''

   One in four American women gives birth by
Caesarean section, and that rate appears to be leveling off after
years of sharp increases, a public interest group said Thursday.
   However, the Public Citizen Health Research Group estimated that
more than half of the abdominal operations are unnecessary and that
women should be encouraged more actively to deliver naturally.
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists agreed
that the C-section rate appears to be leveling off, but the
professional organization rejected the report's claim that doctors
are abusing the procedure.
   The group's report analyzed data from 40 states and the District
of Columbia and found the rate of C-section births rose 0.3 percent
_ from 24.1 percent to 24.4 percent of all births _ from 1986 to
1987.
   The increase was the smallest annual rise in 12 years in a rate
that has more than quadrupled since 1970, when 5.5 percent of all
births were C-sections.
   ``It looks like this is for real, and it's long overdue,'' said
Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, co-author of the report.
   Dr. Lynn Silver, the other author, said the change is due to
attention focused on the issue and women who are ``starting to ask
the right questions about this procedure.''
   The group said nearly 51 percent of the 934,000 surgical
procedures commonly called C-sections performed in 1987 nationwide
were unnecessary
   Silver said that cost the nation more than $1 billion in health
care costs and put thousands of women at higher risk needlessly,
Silver said.
   The report identified two hospitals where half or more of the
babies born in 1987 were delivered by C-section: Hialeah
Hospital-Dade in Florida, 53.1 percent of its 2,239 births, and
Montgomery County Memorial Hospital in Iowa, 50 percent of its 56
births.
   Wolfe said doctors and hospitals have an incentive to perform
C-sections because they make more money on the procedure, which is
more complicated than natural delivery and requires a longer
hospital stay for the mother. He also said doctors like the
convenience of scheduling a birth during working hours.
   The report found that private, for-profit hospitals had a higher
C-section rate, averaging 24 percent, and military and public health
service hospitals had the lowest, averaging 15 percent.
   The report estimates that the optimal average U.S. C-section rate
is about 12 percent. The figure is based on an estimate of Dr. E.J.
Quilligan, dean of the School of Medicine at the University of
California at Irvine. The estimate also is based on data from other
countries and U.S. hospitals that have tried to stop unnecessary
surgery, as well as clinical trials examining the usefulness of
C-sections for women, the report said.
   The group's estimate of unnecessary C-sections was derived by
comparing the 12 percent target rate with the actual rate.
   But Morton Lebow, a spokesman for the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, maintained that the report provides
``no reliable data to establish a correct rate for C-sections.''
   He said his group is ``concerned about the rate of C-sections''
and he noted the organization last fall strengthened its guidelines
recommending that pregnant women who previously gave birth by
C-section deliver vaginally if there is no medical reason not to.
   The report recommends that states require disclosure to maternity
patients of C-section rates for all doctors and hospitals in their
area and second opinions for C-sections that are not emergencies.
   It also says doctors should use more fetal tests to reduce the
number of false diagnoses of fetal distress, which often lead to
unnecessary C-sections.

   Democrats rallied around Ronald Brown Thursday
as the Washington attorney moved toward the party chairmanship.
   Former Rep. James Stanton of Ohio, one of his rivals for the
party post withdrew from the contest and endorsed Brown.
   ``I learned how to count votes a long time ago,'' said Stanton.
``I recognized that I did not have the votes to win.''
   The former congressman urged Democrats to ``unite behind Ron
Brown.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, one of the contenders for the
1988 Democratic presidential nomination, made public a letter to his
state party chairman in which he said, ``It is clear that Ron Brown
will become chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
   ``I have worked with Ron and I know that he has all the necessary
skills and qualifications for the job. Ron will be an outstanding
chairman.''
   Gephardt urged Missouri Democrats to give Brown their support and
cooperation.
   Stanton's withdrawal narrowed the field to Brown and former Rep.
Jim Jones of Oklahoma.
   Brown virtually locked up the post Wednesday when Michigan
Democratic Party chairman Richard Wiener withdrew and endorsed
Brown. Brown and Wiener were regarded as the two leading contenders
for the post which will be filled by the national committee on Feb.
10.
   Paul G. Kirk Jr., party chairman since 1985, declined to seek
another four-year term.

   L. Douglas Wilder, a grandson of slaves and
the first black to win a statewide election in Virginia, began
campaigning Thursday to become the first elected black governor in
the nation.
   But the 58-year-old former state legislator, who defied experts
four years ago by beating a white candidate to become lieutenant
governor, said he would not let race become an issue in the campaign.
   ``I hope that it plays as little part in this electoral process
as possible,'' said Wilder, who is unopposed for the Democratic
nomination in a state with a 17 percent black population.
   Wilder told about 300 supporters at a downtown convention center
and thousands of television viewers watching the rally statewide via
satellite that he would campaign on a ``Three for Virginia'' program
of permanent tax relief, initiatives to combat illegal drugs and
drug-related crime, and the creation of jobs and housing in poor
rural areas.
   Wilder wrapped himself in the thriving economy cloak of
Democratic Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, who by law cannot succeed
himself, and said he would build on Baliles' accomplishments.
   He also paid tribute to two pillars of political succcess in the
state _ conservative fiscal policy and business leadership.
   ``Today, because of Virginia's great natural and human resources
and Democratic fiscally conservative management, we have provided
improved services with budget surpluses,'' he said.
   As for business, he said, ``Every governor of this state has
relied on the keen insight of the Virginia business community. I
intend to follow this tradition.''
   Nowhere in his 15-minute announcement did Wilder make specific
reference to the historic aspect of his campaign, but he made a few
comments about how times have changed and, at a news conference
afterward, said he was aware of the interest because of his race.
   ``Forty years ago, working my way through college and law school
as a waiter and bus boy, I never dreamed I would have the
opportunity to run for governor of Virginia,'' he said.
   Wilder's campaign theme included:
   _ Pushing to repeal the sales tax on food in future years and a
promise to neither propose nor initiate new taxes. But Wilder would
not rule out signing a tax hike if it becomes necessary.
   _ Cracking down on drug dealers.
   _ Expanding economic prosperity statewide, a point made by
Wilder's only challenger for the nomination, state Sen. Daniel W.
Bird Jr. before he withdrew from the campaign Tuesday.
   Virtually the entire state Democratic leadership attended the
rally, but noticeably absent was U.S. Sen. Charles S. Robb. Wilder
said Robb, Baliles' predecessor who was elected to the Senate in
November, was busy in Washington.
   Wilder has had differences in the past with both Robb and
Baliles, but the theme Thursday was unity. Baliles introduced Wilder
as ``a man who does not flinch in cause of justice and does not
hesitate in the search for progress.''
   Wilder will be nominated at the state Democratic Convention in
Richmond in June. His Republican opponent will be decided in a June
13 primary.
   The GOP has four contenders for the office: former U.S. Sen. Paul
S. Trible Jr., former Attorney General J. Marshall Coleman, Rep.
Stanford E. Parris of northern Virginia and Del. Raymond R. ``Andy''
Guest Jr., a state legislator from the Shenandoah Valley.
   ``I will be prepared to deal with each of them,'' Wilder said.

<HEAD>Walesa to Meet Interior Minister to Prepare for Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and the
interior minister will start preparatory negotiations Friday for
upcoming talks on the future of the banned union, a Solidarity
spokesman said.
   A statement released by Solidarity national spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz on Thursday said Walesa will chair the Solidarity
delegation, but did not indicate who else from the union would
participate in the talks.
   Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak was the only government
official the Solidarity statement said would attend the talks. A
government spokesman declined to provide the names of any other
potential participants.
   Earlier Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski
said the long-awaited talks between the government and opposition
``should begin in the nearest days.''
   In response to question whether the talks would begin Feb. 5,
Staniszewski said, ``It is a very probable date.'' But he said since
that date falls on a Sunday, the talks could possibly also begin
Feb. 6.
   The talks are expected to address a broad range of issues,
including trade union, political and economic freedoms.
   Walesa arrived by train in Warsaw from his home city of Gdansk on
Thursday, said Jacek Ambroziak, a lawyer for the Roman Catholic
Episcopate.
   The Solidarity leader met with senior advisers of the banned
union, including Andrzej Stelmachowski, a lawyer who has been active
in arranging talks between Walesa and the authorities in the past.
   Stelmachowski declined to provide any details on the talks. Other
top Solidarity advisers were being cautious in discussing Walesa's
plans.
   Walesa eluded a group of journalists when he departed from his
usual practice of getting off the express from Gdansk at Warsaw
Central station and got out earlier at a station in the outskirts of
the city.
   The Solidarity statement said Walesa planned to hold a news
conference Saturday.
   The government first proposed the talks during a wave of strikes
in August, the country's worst labor unrest since the government
imposed martial on Dec. 13, 1981.
   Since August, Walesa has traveled to Warsaw four times for
discussions about the proposal with senior government officials
since August. But the Solidarity leader said he would not hold talks
on Poland's future until the authorities decided to legalize the
banned union.
   In a dramatic reversal of policy last week, the Communist Party
Central Committee approved an offer to allow more than one legal
trade union to exist and participation by the opposition in
government bodies.
   The Solidarity leadership on Sunday agreed to hold negotiations
with the government on legalizing the union.
   Deputy Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula, explaining the party's
about-face on Solidarity in an interview with the state-run news
agency PAP, said only compromise could lift the people and economy
from the current state of apathy.

<HEAD>Anti-Semitic Acts Rise to 5-Year High, ADL Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of anti-Semitic incidents rose to a
five-year high in 1988, with reports of harassment incidents up 41
percent and vandalism up 19 percent, a Jewish group said Thursday.
   Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith, said he could not point to a single factor for the
increase, but said there were ``stimulants'' such as neo-Nazi
skinheads, the 50th anniversary of the start of the Holocaust and
developments in the Middle East.
   ``Isn't it ironic that in our lifetime we've conquered space and
even eradicated smallpox,'' Foxman said, ``yet we have not developed
a vaccine against the virus of hate.''
   An ADL survey released here included nearly 1,300 incidents
reported by law enforcement authorities in 40 states, the District
of Columbia and Puerto Rico. There were no incidents reported in 10
states, said ADL spokesman Richard Klein.
   New York led the nation with 208 incidents, half of those in New
York City. California had 121, Florida 89 and New Jersey 67.
   ``We may never be able to completely eradicate mindless bigotry
or the violence of hate,'' U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh
wrote in a forward to the ADL survey. But ``we can pursue swift and
sure prosecution of these crimes against the American dream.''
   The number of anti-Semitic harassment incidents, such things as
threats and assaults, totaled 458 in 1988, up 41 percent from 324 in
1987.
   Of those, 325 were against Jewish individuals, including 21
physical assaults.The report cited a November attack against a
Yeshiva University student in New York City as being among the most
brutal. A gang of youths allegedly shouted anti-Semitic epithets as
they beat, robbed and stabbed the 19-year-old, who survived.
   It was a record year for harassment incidents against Jewish
institutions in the 10 years the survey has been taken. Threats and
other harassment incidents against institutions were reported in 133
cases, up about 10 percent from previous years, the group said.
   In the category of vandalism against individuals and
institutions, there were a total of 823 incidents reported in 1988,
up from 694 the previous year. Most of those were anti-Semitic
graffiti and cemetery desecrations, but there were more serious
incidents, such as a pipe bomb exploding inside a Florida synagogue
and an arson fire that destroyed a Brooklyn synagogue in September.
   An unusually large number of vandalism incidents were reported in
the South _ 172 cases in 12 states, up from 115 in 1987 _ where
there are mostly smaller Jewish populations, the report said.
   Geographically, the Northeast had the greatest number of
incidents _ 411 in 11 states and the District of Columbia _ while
the West was the only region to report a decrease. Figures there
dropped 7 percent from 157 incident to 146 in six states. Incidents
in the Midwest rose slightly from 85 in 1987 to 92 in 1988.
   Other disturbing statistics showed that of the 124 people
arrested for anti-Semitic acts in 1988, approximately 90 percent
were under 21.
   Foxman said the 1988 survey makes it clear ``We have a long way
to go and still have much to do.''
   He called for continued efforts by law enforcement authorities to
apprehend those who practice hate crimes, better anti-bias education
programs for youths in schools, churches and after-school programs
and strict enforcement of anti-bias legislation, which is now in
effect in 43 states.
   As for the cause of the increase in bias incident reports, Foxman
said, ``We cannot so easily say this is the cause and this is the
effect.'' But he noted some specific ``stimulants,'' including:
   _The uprising by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, which
began in late 1987. Foxman said he believes anti-Semites used the
situation to carry out acts of hatred ``under the guise of a
political conflict.'' There were 117 incidents were linked to the
uprising.
   _A proliferation of neo-Nazi Skinhead gangs, who preach violence
and hatred against blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Asians and homosexuals.
They were said to be responsible for 41 anti-Semitic incidents last
year.
   _Publicity marking the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht in
Germany, believed by many to have been the start of the Nazi
Holocaust. More than 60 anti-Semitic incidents were reported during
the weeklong observation in November.
   The report said there was a significant increase in the number of
American colleges reporting anti-Semitic incidents _ from 14
campuses in 1987 to 38 campuses in 1988. The 54 incidents at the 38
schools included vandalism, threats, harassment and assault.

<HEAD>Group Proposes Fee to Finance Tightened Border Security</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private group lobbying to stem the flow of
illegal immigrants into the United States on Thursday proposed
charging $2 to enter the country and using the money to tighten
border security.
   The estimated $500 million to $600 million a year that could be
raised from the fee, the Federation for American Immigration Reform
said, could finance intensified border patrols and the replacement
of 28 miles of metal fence that has become so dilapidated it cannot
``withstand the onslaught of humanity.''
   ``Everyone has the right to lock his own back door. Those who
ignore the lock and enter without permission are guilty of breaking
and entering,'' the group said in a report that also proposed
building 25 miles of sunken concrete fences in San Diego and El
Paso, Texas, where the Border Patrol makes 70 percent of its 1
million arrests annually.
   The non-profit group's proposals, called ``Ten Steps to Securing
America's Borders,'' went substantially beyond plans by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to build a $2 million,
4-mile-long, 14-foot-wide ditch along the San Diego border. The
ditch, intended to stop vehicular traffic, is expected to be
completed by the fall.
   One author of the report, retired Border Patrol Chief Roger P.
Brandemuehl, said the INS ditch would not stop people trying to
sneak across the border on foot.
   His organization proposed, instead, 12-foot sunken concrete
retaining walls topped by 8-foot metal fences along the San Diego
and El Paso border segments.
   The 28 miles of metal fence currently in place along the southern
border is so dilapidated that it ``could not keep a small child out
of a basketball court,'' said Patrick Burns, the group's assistant
director.
   ``It simply cannot withstand the onslaught of humanity,'' he
said. ``It is attacked by everything from blow torches to
bulldozers.''
   The user fee would provide $200 million to build the new barriers
plus another $200 million for more Border Patrol agents and
surveillance equipment in isolated areas, said Patrick Burns, the
group's assistant director.
   Burns said that ``anyone who can't afford two bucks shouldn't be
crossing an international boundry'' and pointed out that people
flying into the United States already pay a $10 fee.
   The group said 90 percent of the arrests of illegal aliens occur
along just 200 miles of the 2,000-mile southern border.
   The report was written with the cooperation of the INS, which
said through spokesman Verne Jervis that it was ``studying the
study.''
   Jervis said INS currently has 4,000 Border Patrol agents, mostly
along the border with Mexico. He acknowledged that the metal fence
is poorly maintained and that ``it's easy to cut, it's easy to
penetrate.''
   He acknowledged that a user fee might enable INS to hire more
inspectors at border crossings, thereby shortening the often
three-to-four hour wait.
   The federation's advisory committee includes former Attorney
General William French Smith; ex-Sen. Walter D. Huddleston, D-Ky.;
former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm, and John V. Lindsay, former mayor
of New York City.
   Both the federation's proposal and the INS plan drew criticism
from the League of United Latin American Citizens.
   That organization's national political director, Arnoldo Torres,
said physical barriers ``will only exacerbate tension and problems''
along the border.
   Torres said the federation was trying to ``play to the fear'' of
illegal immigration.
   He said his organization has send President Bush and Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh telegrams urging them to reconsider the
4-mile ditch plan.
   Torres said many Hispanic leaders in San Diego have approached
his group to support ``civil disobedience on the physical
construction of that ditch.''
   ``There is that strong a conviction of Hispanics along the border
that they were willing to do that,'' he said.

   Someone broke into the

Dick Dale's first electric guitar, museum officials said.
   ``I feel sick about it, really sick,'' said Natalie Kotsch, who

   Museum officials said Wednesday someone broke into the facility
over the weekend by removing louvered windows.
   The guitar, an unsual left-handed model with an ivory-colored

videocassette recorder.
   ``My concern now is that we don't want people to think that we
won't take care of the things we give us,'' Ms. Kotsch said. She
added that the Hard Rock Cafe had tried to buy the guitar from Dale

<HEAD>Finance Minister Promises No Cover-Up in Trading Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The finance minister promised a parliamentary
committee Thursday there will be no cover-up of an insider trading
scandal involving a close friend of President Francois Mitterrand.
   At a hearing of the National Assembly's finance committee,
Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said the government will order a
criminal investigation in the case, regardless of the conclusions of
a report expected next week from the commission that oversees
operations of France's stock exchange.
   ``This affair will not be covered up, and I think that's a change
in comparison with a slightly earlier period,'' Beregovoy said, in a
veiled reference to political scandals the Socialists say were left
unresolved under previous conservative governments.
   Commission reports usually are not made public, but Mitterrand
issued a statement late Thursday saying he and other top government
officials had agreed to make an exception and release the report
being prepared in this case.
   French, American and Swiss investigators have been looking into
suspicious trading in shares of the U.S. firm Triangle Industries
Inc., just before it was acquired last fall by the state-owned
French metals producer Pechiney SA.
   Some investors made quick profits by buying Triangle stock at
about $10 a share and selling them a few days later, following
Pechiney's takeover bid Nov. 21, at $56 a share. These investors
include Roger-Patrice Pelat, a retired businessman who is perhaps
Mitterrand's oldest and closest friend.
   Pelat has refused comment on suggestions he benefitted from
inside information and says he won't say anything until after the
stock exchange commission makes its report.
   The scandal has led to the resignation of Beregovoy's chief of
staff, Alain Boublil, who said he quit so he could defend his
innocence more vigorously.
   Both the Communist Party and the conservative Rally for the
Republic party have been calling for an independent parliamentary
inquiry.
   Alain Juppe, secretary-general of the Rally for the Republic, had
told reporters he was ``very worried about the risk of a cover-up.''
   ``This affair is more serious than it looks,'' Juppe said. ``It
raises questions about a certain conception of politics and its
relations with morality. If the general suspicion of corruption
continues to weigh on the political community, this is not
acceptable.''
   French newspaper reports say the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission told its French counterpart it was looking into purchases
of about 220,000 shares in Triangle just before the takeover bid.
   Only sketchy information about most of the buyers has become
public, and there has been little more than speculation about who
might have leaked valuable tips about the imminent takeover bid.
   ``My personal conviction is that there was insider trading, but
I'm completely unable to prove it,'' Jean Gandois, president of
Pechiney, said in an interview on French radio Thursday.
   Gandois defended the high price Pechiney paid for Triangle, the
parent firm of American National Can, saying it was worth it to
establish the French company as world leader in metal packaging.
   Beregovoy told the parliamentary committee that Pechiney's
purchase ``is a good deal and the price paid corresponds to the
American market.''
   The finance minister said he had asked all his aides who had
advance knowledge of the takeover ``on their honor'' if they leaked
the information, and the answer ``on their part was that no
indiscretion had been committed.''

<TEXT>
   Iran on Thursday warned of ``dangers''
threatening regional peace from within Iraq and asked a U.N. envoy
to pressure Baghdad to stick to terms of the cease-fire in the
Persian Gulf War.
   Iranian Prime Minister Hussein Musavi told visiting U.N. envoy
Jan Eliasson that Iran ``will spare no effort'' to secure a
permanent peace treaty with Iraq, according to the official Islamic
Republic News Agency monitored in Nicosia.
   Eliasson, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's
special emissary, arrived in Tehran on Monday seeking to breathe new
life into peace talks broken off Nov. 11. The talks followed a
cease-fire agreed to by both sides on Aug. 20 after eight years of
war that left an estimated 1 million people dead.
   The U.N. envoy was scheduled to visit Baghdad on Friday to meet
senior leaders and seek ways of fully putting into effect the U.N.
Security Council's cease-fire resolution.
   Iraqi Information Minister Latif Nussayif Jasim said Wednesday
that ``any spark'' on the tense border, where both sides still have
large numbers of troops, could trigger new hostilities.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq alleged earlier this month that
Iran was massing troops along the 730-mile border between the two
countries.
   U.N. military observers say the cease-fire is holding, despite
clais of violations by both sides. But the stalemate in peace talks
appears to have hardened.
   The Iranian news agency quoted Musavi as saying, ``We are
concerned about dangers threatening the accomplishment of peace from
inside Iraq and believe that an international effort is needed to
make the Baghdad regime understand that it should respect
international agreements for the cause of peace.''
   The report did not elaborate on the alleged threat.
   Musavi stressed Iraq still occupies about 260 square miles of
Iranian border territory and refuses to withdraw its troops, the
agency said.
   ``How can we believe that Iraq will abide by the articles of the
(U.N.) resolution while part of our country is still under
occupation?'' he was quoted as saying.
   The agency quoted Eliasson as saying, ``We expect both sides to
pave the way for peace by taking positive steps.''

   Heavily armed police and soldiers
patrolled the country Thursday in a crackdown on ``subversive
activity'' a day after the assassination of the former armed forces
chief.
   Gen. Gustavo Adolfo Alvarez Martinez, who allowed Contra rebels
from Nicaragua to use Honduran territory to stage operations, was
killed by six gunmen as he sat in his car Wednesday, officials said.
His chauffeur was also killed, and his son-in-law was wounded.
   ``We have increased security measures to protect citizens and
stop the increase of subversive activity in our country,'' National
Police chief Col. Leonel Riera Lunatti said Thursday.
   Military sources said an alert was declared Wednesday after a
meeting of the National Security Council with President Jose Azcona
Hoyo. On Thursday, leaders ordered stricter security measures,
including searches of vehicles and residents, the sources said.
   The leftist Popular Liberation Movement said in a communique that
one of its units carried out the attack on the former head of the
armed forces. But police said they had no evidence to confirm the
claim.
   Alvarez, 56, had supervised a counterinsurgency campaign against
suspected Honduran guerrillas.
   Top-level military officials said they fear leftist guerrillas
had begun a clandestine operation aimed at killing top military
officials. Government forces on Thursday closely guarded homes of
high officials, said a military official on condition of anonymity.
   Guards at military bases have been reinforced and dogs trained in
bomb detection have been deployed, the official said.
   Alvarez, who headed the national police in 1981 and supervised
the armed forces from 1982 to 1984, once was considered the most
powerful man in Honduras. He was overthrown by officials led by Gen.
Walter Lopez Reyes, who accused him of corruption and abuse of power.
   The local Human Rights Commission accused Alvarez of ordering the
political killings of hundreds of people, but the armed forces deny
the accusations.
   Alvarez also presided over the beginning of joint U.S.-Honduran
military exercises in Honduras that were designed to intimidate the
rulers of neighboring Nicaragua.
   He played a key role in supporting Contra rebels by telling late
CIA director William Casey that they could operate from Honduran
territory. They used their Honduran bases to attack Nicaragua's
leftist government.
   On Jan. 7, Nicaraguan rebel military commander Manuel Adan Rugama
Acevedo was fatally shot just outside the capital.
   On Monday, two gunmen killed Carlos Diaz Lorenzana, a lawyer for
reputed drug baron Juan Ramon Matta. His extradition to the United
States last year led to riots and a state of emergency.

   Three students and one adult were shot outside
a District of Columbia high school Thursday in an affluent
neighborhood, according to a school spokeswoman.
   The shootings at Wilson High School in Northwest Washington came
a week after a shooting incident outside a school in Stockton,
Calif., in which five children were killed.
   Thursday's incident occurred moments after the high school
students were dismissed for the day. None of the injuries was
thought to be life-threatening, according to WUSA-TV.
   No arrests were made immediately.
   One victim reportedly was shot in the face, one in the stomach
and two in the leg.
   Doug Hill, a local weatherman, said he was driving in front of
the high school when he heard automatic gunfire and screams. Hill
said about 200 to 250 students were outside of the building when he
heard eight or nine shots from an automatic weapon.
   A student identified as Miriam Kenyon said she saw an armed black
man wearing dark clothing flee the scene.
   In the California shootings, a young drifter wearing combat
fatigues opened fire Jan. 17 with an assault rifle at children in an
elementary school yard. Five children were killed and 30 people were
wounded before the gunman shot himself to death.
   The gunman, identified at Patrick Edward Purdy, 26, had an
``extensive criminal record,'' but police had ``no idea'' of a
motive, officials said.

<HEAD>Cardinal Says Soviet Union Still Opposes Papal Visit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist authorities in the Soviet republic of
Lithuania would welcome a visit to the Roman Catholic stronghold by
Pope John Paul II but Moscow continues to oppose the idea,
Lithuania's cardinal said Thursday.
   Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevicius, in Rome for talks with the pope,
said he raised the issue of a papal visit in a meeting this week in
Moscow with an official in the government's council for religious
affairs.
   ``At this time, the government of Moscow is very much against a
visit of the pope,'' the 68-year-old cardinal said in an interview
with The Associated Press.
   He said Sergei Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet department on
Catholic affairs, ``answered with an objection, saying, `Why isn't
the Vatican taking steps to meet the East's desires? Why isn't the
pope taking steps to improve relations?'''
   Sladkevicius said the Kremlin position differed from that of
Lithuania's Communist Party chief, Algirdas Brazauskas, who
indicated at a recent meeting in Kaisiadorys that the local
government was very much in favor of a papal visit.
   The cardinal said the Lithuanian government is ``still very
dependent on Moscow'' and could not clear the way for a papal visit
on its own.
   The Polish-born pontiff frequently has expressed the desire to
travel to the Soviet Union but insisted he would go only if
permitted to visit his flock throughout the country.
   He has said that at least on two occasions he has been refused
permission to visit Lithuania.
   Lithuania, an independent country before World War II, was
occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940 and has been viewed as a
stronghold of nationalism. Sladkevicius said about 80 percent of
Lithuania's 3.5 million people are Roman Catholics.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is scheduled to make an
official visit to Rome in November, and the Vatican has said the
pope is open to a meeting with him. Such a meeting has been
portrayed as a possible prelude to the first ever visit by a pope to
the Soviet Union.
   Sladkevicius, who was confined to virtual house arrest from 1959
until 1982, was elevated to cardinal in June by the pope. He said
the situation of the Catholic church in Lithuania had improved under
Gorbachev but that Catholics ``are still second-class citizens.''
   ``If the natural desire for independence becomes realized, then
... religious problems will resolve themselves,'' he said, speaking
slowly in English in the interview in a tiny hotel room.
   On the positive side, he said the Soviet government recently
decided to allow Bishop Juliajonas Steponavicius to resume his
official duties as apostolic administrator of Vilnius after nearly
28 years of internal exile.
   Sladkevicius said the government on Feb. 5 will return the
Vilnius Cathedral, which was converted into a state art gallery in
1950, to the church. On the same day, a Catholic magazine,
Believers' World, will start up in Vilnius.
   St. Casimir's Church, which has been a museum since 1962, will be
returned to the church in March, he said.
   ``We are evaluating the changes. They are very good but we are
not certain about the future,'' said Sladkevicius.
   ``The nation was faithful to its Catholic faith but only part of
the nation could practice openly. Now the obstacles have been
removed,'' he said.
   Sladkevicius is one of two cardinals in the Soviet Union.
Julijans Vaivods of Latvia was elevated by John Paul in 1983.

<HEAD>Study: Shooting Cocaine More Likely to Transmit AIDS than Shooting
Heroin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Drug abusers who inject cocaine are more likely to
catch AIDS infections from the practice than those who shoot heroin,
researchers found in a study of 633 addicts in San Francisco.
   Injection of cocaine promotes more sharing of hypodermic needles
than heroin injection because cocaine's briefer euphoria requires
more doses _ up to 10 a day, the researchers said.
   ``The cocaine association is news. This is the first time it's
ever been reported,'' said Dr. Richard E. Chaisson, formerly of the
University of California at San Francisco and now of Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine in Baltimore.
   Chaisson and fellow researchers studied 633 heroin addicts
enrolled in drug treatment programs in San Francisco from May 1986
to July 1987. About 60 percent of the addicts also injected cocaine.
   Seventy-seven of the addicts in the study, or 12 percent, were
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, the researchers
reported in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Among addicts who did not use cocaine at all, 8 percent were
infected, Chaisson said.
   Addicts who injected cocaine once a month had a 15 percent HIV
infection rate, those who injected it weekly had a 21 percent
infection rate, and those who injected it daily had a 28 percent
infection rate, Chaisson said.
   ``There were striking increases in infection rate with increasing
use of the drug,'' Chaisson said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
``That was not seen with heroin use in a similar pattern.''
   Intravenous drug abusers account for 20 percent of the more than
83,000 adult cases of AIDS reported to the national Centers for
Disease Control since 1979. Experts believe HIV infection is spread
among this group through blood residue on shared needles.
   The study found that if addicts used cocaine regularly, they were
more likely to share needles with many people. Increased usage was
associated with a greater likelihood the addict had injected cocaine
at a ``shooting gallery,'' where people buy drugs and rent needles,
Chaisson said.
   ``If someone goes to a shooting gallery, they pay a dollar and
get a syringe. They have no idea how many people have used that
needle,'' he said.
   Chaisson said the government estimates that 900,000 people in
this country abuse drugs by injecting them. He said he believes
anywhere from 100,000 to 500,000 people inject cocaine, less than 10
percent of all people using the drug.
   ``Heroin is not the only problem or even the major problem,''
Chaisson said. ``Cocaine has emerged as a more serious problem than
heroin, in part because methadone is available to control heroine
abuse, but nothing is available to control cocaine.''
   Chaisson said 95 percent of the subjects were able to reduce
their heroin use with methadone, a drug substitute used in treatment
programs to reduce the craving for heroin.
   A quarter of the addicts in the study who took cocaine began
using it after they had begun treatment with methadone, Chaisson
said.
   Blacks had a disproportionately high number of AIDS virus
infections in the study, Chaisson said. Forty-eight of 188 blacks
were infected, a rate of 26 percent, compared with 20 of 328 whites,
or 6 percent, and nine of 94 Hispanics, or 10 percent, the study
found.
   The reason blacks have a disproportionately high rate of AIDS
virus infections is unknown, the study said. However, it found that
blacks used cocaine in higher proportion than whites. Researchers
said more frequent injections may put blacks and Hispanics at higher
risk than whites.

<TEXT>
   Radio and press reports Thursday said the
release of two British hostages might be imminent, and British
Ambassador Allan Ramsay crossed into Moslem West Beirut.
   After Ramsay's return to the British Embassy, in the Christian
sector of the divided capital, an embassy official said, ``We have
no additional information.''
   Asked whether a hostage release was expected, he said, ``All I
can tell you is that we're not on alert.'' The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Earlier, when asked by telephone if his trip was linked to the
press reports, Ramsay said from the British consular office in the
Moslem sector: ``I often come to west Beirut and there's nothing
significant in my current visit.''
   An embassy spokesman had said the purpose of Ramsay's journey was
to check the reports.
   The British Embassy and Ramsay's residence are in east Beirut.
Most hostages are believed held in west Beirut's Shiite Moslem slums.
   The reports said kidnapped British journalist John McCarthy and
teacher Brian Keenan, who has Irish and British citizenship, could
be freed within days.
   Patrick McCabe, who is Ireland's ambassador to Lebanon but is
based in Iraq, said he would fly to Beirut immediately to
investigate.
   McCarthy and Keenan are among 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon,
who include two more Britons and nine Americans. Held longest is
Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   One of the other Britons is Terry Waite, a Church of England
envoy who disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beirut
hotel to negotiate with people holding American hostages.
   Most of the foreigners are believed to be captives of Shiite
extremists loyal to Iran, but no faction has claimed to hold Waite
or McCarthy and Keenan, who were seized in April 1986.
   Reports of the possible release came from the Voice of Lebanon, a
Christian radio station, and Al-Hayat, an Arabic-language newspaper
published in London. The paper spoke of ``discussions under way
between Iran and countries involved'' about freeing Keenan and
McCarthy.
   Ramsay said in the telephone interview none of the reports or
attendant rumors ``can be verified. ... I'm anxious to avoid
speculation on that subject.''
   Earlier, the embassy spokesman said: ``We have heard a report and
we're making enquiries.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   McCarthy, 31, a producer for London-based Worldwide Television
news, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, as he drove to the airport to
catch a flight home. Keenan, 38, of Belfast, Northern Ireland, an
English language teacher at the American University of Beirut, was
seized six days earlier in west Beirut.
   McCabe, the Irish ambassador, said he was visiting Lebanon ``to
investigate a rumor'' circulated Wednesday in Baghdad that the two
men would be freed within 72 hours, but that he had no specific
information.
   ``Is there something hard behind the rumor?'' he said. ``I don't
know. ... I am always skeptical about the rumor-mill in Beirut.''
   Sources in Belfast said privately the British Foreign Office told
Keenan's family there were hopes for ``good news'' soon. His two
sisters were said to be planning a trip to Beirut.
   Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan of Ireland met with his Iranian
counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati in Paris this month during an
international conference. Declan Connolly, who is Irish ambassador
to Syria from his base in Saudi Arabia, met with the Syrian foreign
minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, on Wednesday in Damascus.
   On Thursday, Connolly said he had heard the hostage reports but
was in Syria on a routine visit.
   Syria has about 40,000 soldiers stationed in Lebanon and is the
country's main power broker. It also supported Iran in the war with
Iraq, in which a cease-fire was reached in August.
   Relations have improved between Britain and Iran, which restored
full diplomatic relations in November after a break of 17 months.
Nicholas Nicola, a 23-year-old Briton held in Iran for two years
after a shooting incident, was freed earlier this month.
   Iran's official news agency quoted Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohatashami on Thursday, however, as saying British businessman
Roger Cooper would be punished according to Islamic law. Cooper has
been in jail since 1986 on espionage charges.

   Senate committees, working Thursday to fill
vacancies at President Bush's Cabinet table, examined one nominee's
relationships to defense contractors, heard another defend Bush's
``flexible freeze'' budget plan and got suggestions from a third on
how he will manage America's open spaces.
   As the process unfolded, former Republican Sen. John Tower of
Texas told the Senate Armed Services Committee the $763,777 he made
as a defense consultant over the past three years will not influence
his actions if he is confirmed as Bush's secretary of defense.
   At other hearings:
   _Michael Boskin, selected to be Bush's chief economic adviser,
told the Senate Banking Committee, he believes spending cuts can be
made in defense and health care spending and that Bush will be ready
with specific ``flexible freeze'' proposals when he addresses a
joint meeting of Congress on Feb 9.
   _Former Republican Rep. Manuel Lujan Jr. told the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources Committee that he views the job of secretary
of the interior as one of ``stewardship'' and will, if confirmed,
try to enlist thousands of volunteers as helpers in the national
park and fish and wildlife systems.
   The energy panel voted to endorse the Lujan nomination and sent
it to the full Senate where a vote is expected next Wednesday.
   Tower, a former Armed Services Committee chairman, told that
panel Congress should slow down the ``revolving door'' through which
some top defense officials pass on the way to high-paying civilian
jobs in the defense industry.
   Pentagon officials should be barred, Tower said, ``from profiting
unfairly, unethically, or illegally or inordinately'' if they move
between Pentagon and industry jobs.
   Tower had little to offer on how, in a period of increasingly
tight budgets, he would act to shape such major procurement programs
as those for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the MX and Midgetman
missiles, special operation forces or the goal of building a
600-ship navy.
   ``Nothing is sacred,'' Tower said, adding that specific decisions
must await the conclusion of a review ordered by Bush.
   Senators opened the session with a detailed review of Tower's
relations with defense contractors since 1985, when he ended a
24-year Senate career that included a 1981-84 stint as Armed
Services chairman. .
   He said he cut all financial ties to the defense industry on Dec.
1, one day after learning he was under serious consideration for the
defense post. He said he did not ``stand to gain from the prosperity
of any former associate.''
   But Tower was told by chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., that his
situation did pose difficulty in that he had been involved with as
many as seven major defense contractors, all of whom play roles in
military procurement.
   Tower promised to ``bend over backwards'' to avoid favoring his
former associates.
   Elsewhere at the Capitol, Boskin faced questions about how
spending programs might be affected by Bush's budget plans. The
Stanford University professor was Bush's principal economic adviser
during last year's presidential campaign and was the author of the
flexible freeze idea.
   That idea _ to keep federal spending level while increasing or
cutting specific programs _ was cited often by candidate Bush when
asked how he planned to augment a variety of domestic programs while
still lowering the budget deficit without raising taxes.
   ``If there are no new taxes, that means there will have to be
some massive cuts in the federal budget,'' said Sen. Larry Pressler,
R-S.D., who repeatedly asked Boskin to specify ``three or four
areas'' where spending reductions should be made.
   Boskin, who emphasized that Bush had not made any final decisions
on the budget, said he would personally favor reducing the size of
growth in the defense budget and in the government's health care
costs.
   ``If I was looking for large savings, they would have to come
from areas where there is large spending,'' Boskin said.
   President Reagan's final $1.15 trillion budget for the fiscal
year which begins next Oct. 1 did propose cuts in Medicare and
Medicaid spending but it sought to boost defense spending authority
by 2 percent above the rate of inflation.
   Bush is expected to seek similar cuts in health care costs and is
likely to trim defense spending to provide funds for areas that he
wants to increase to fulfull his campaign promises.
   Lujan, Bush's choice to be interior secretary, quoted the late
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in saying, ``The country will
not be a good place to live in unless it is a good place for all of
us to live in.''
   ``We want to be known as a team who passed on these national
treasures in better condition than we found them,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the Senate Agriculture Committee postponed a scheduled
hearing on Clayton K. Yeutter's nomination to be secretary of
agriculture. A routine report on the FBI investigation of Yeutter,
who served as U.S. trade representative in the Reagan
administration, had not yet been made available to the panel, a
spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   The United States is a hands-down loser when it
comes to mathematics education and needs major reforms, including
voluntary national standards, to upgrade math achievement, says a
report released Thursday.
   Three out of four U.S. students leave high school without
mastering enough mathematics to cope with either job demands or the
expectations of colleges, said the report by the National Research
Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences and the National
Academy of Engineering.
   The report, ``Everybody Counts,'' says piecemeal local efforts to
correct the nation's math teaching deficiencies are ``totally
inadequate'' and calls for forward-looking national standards to be
adopted by local school systems.
   A recent surge of studies and books has raised concern over the
nation's mathematical skills, with another major study _ an
international survey of math and science performance _ due next week
from the Educational Testing Service.
   Thursday's report reflects the consensus of 70 teachers,
administrators, researchers, executives, parents and government
officials who spent three years studying math education from
kindergarten through graduate school.
   The council concludes that teaching must move away from
pencil-and-paper techniques and memorization toward realistic
problem-solving and early use of computers and calculators, which
the report said have had ``virtually no impact'' on instruction
despite their great potential to enrich it.
   The group said that teachers should be moderators, not lecturers
and that students should take math every year they are in school.
   The authors point to two approaches they say won't work:
   _The ``back to basics'' movement, favored by those who think of
math as an anchor in a sea of change. ``It isn't sufficient to
simply do better on traditional programs,'' Shirley Hill, chairman
of the Mathematical Sciences Education Board, told a news
conference. ``Math changes. The curriculum must keep up. We must be
contemporary.''
   _The ``top-down'' Japanese approach of enforcing a national,
grade-by-grade curriculum. While nations adopting such an approach
``have beaten us hands-down,'' the report said, the technique would
be impractical in the United States.
   The report sasy that ``new math'' was imposed from the top down
and fell flat because teachers and parents were not involved in the
process. The council suggests, instead, what it calls an augmented
grass roots approach _ voluntary, flexible standards with a broad
base of public support.
   A major step toward that goal is expected next month, when the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics publishes ``Curriculum
and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics.'' The research
council called the upcoming study `the first effort ever to
establish national expectations for school mathematics'' and said
draft copies are already influencing textbook publishers and testing
organizations.
   In addition to low math achievement and a stagnant math
curriculum, the authors of ``Everybody Counts'' noted a number of
other problems:
   _The shortage of qualified math teachers is more serious than in
any other area of U.S. education and affects all levels from
elementary to graduate school. The shortage of minority math
teachers is particularly acute.
   _The conventional wisdom is that some people are just bad at
math. But in other industrialized nations, all students are expected
to master a level of math attained only by the best U.S. students.
The result is that U.S. firms are at a competitive disadvantage.
   _U.S. industry spends as much annually on remedial math education
as is spent on math education in schools, colleges and universities
combined.

<HEAD>Study Calls for Tax Increases to Balance Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel headed by former Secretary of State
Edmund Muskie recommended Thursday a broad tax increase as part of a
plan to balance the federal budget, saying ``new taxes will be
unavoidable.''
   The panel also recommended increasing spending on programs
helping children living in poverty, by $2 billion a year for five
years.
   On national defense, it recommended scaling back goals for early
deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative, the Star Wars
nuclear space shield program, and called for a temporary moratorium
on new military procurement.
   The report, called ``America Tomorrow, the Choices We Face,'' was
sent to the White House and other officials of the Bush
administration.
   It was the result of a nearly year-long project sponsored by the
Center for National Policy, a public policy research organization
based in Washington.
   Members of the center's steering committee for the project, all
of whom signed the report, included Paul A. Volcker, former chairman
of the Federal Reserve Board; Adm. Bobby Inman, former No. 2
official at the CIA; Sally Ride, former astronaut; former Sen.
Charles McC. Mathias Jr., of Maryland; Douglas A. Fraser, former
head of the United Auto Workers; Donald M. Stewart, president of the
College Board,; and Isabel V. Sawhill of the Urban Institute.
   The report concludes that massive foreign borrowing and a decline
in domestic saving and investment are serious long-term threats to
American living standards. It recommends a flexible five-year plan
to balance the budget and balance foreign trade figures by fiscal
1994.
   It recommends spending cuts and small revenue increases for the
first year, followed by a move to a two-year budget cycle in fiscal
1991. It would add tax increases amounting to $25 billion over each
of the following four years.
   ``New taxes will be unavoidable, not only to achieve a net
deficit reduction of $100 billion, but also to cover infrastructure
problems,'' the report said.
   It recommends several possibilities, including raising income tax
rates by 1 percent a year for four years; a 25 cent increase in the
gasoline tax; an across-the-board tax on energy; raising tobacco and
alcohol taxes; taxing Social Security benefits as income;
eliminating or limiting the tax deduction for home mortgage
interest, and taxing employer contributions for medical insurance.
   ``There is no question that the nation must confront the issue of
which existing taxes to increase or what new taxes to create,'' the
report said.
   The report said child poverty rates have been rising in recent
years, and seem likely to continue. One quarter of American children
under age 6 now live in poverty, and children now represent the
poorest age group in the nation, it said.
   It recomends adding $2 billion each year to existing and
experimental poverty programs directed at young children as an
investment in the prevention of costly long-term problems.
   On defense, it said the nation should take advantage of a new
relationship with the Soviet Union by proposing to reduce the
conventional arms forces in Europe on both sides ``down to a point
equal to approximately 50 percent of current NATO levels, phased in
over eight years.''
   It calls for continuing strategic arms control talks and
modernizing the land-based missile force by development of a small,
mobile single-warhead intercontinental ballistic missile.
   It calls for scaling back deployment goals for Star Wars, while
continuing research and arms talks.
   The report advocates Pentagon management reforms and would impose
a series of procurement moratoriums while review is under way.

<HEAD>Egypt Reported to Back Away From Declaring Sovereignty in Beach Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli official said Egypt backed away from
a demand to take control Sunday over a disputed beachfront after
Israel warned that such a move would jeopardize talks on the strip.
   The director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, Reuven Merhav,
told Israel Radio that Egypt reconsidered its demand to take control
of the area, known as Taba, this weekend because of pressure from
Israel and the United States. Washington is mediating the talks.
   Israel has insisted that decisions about access for Israeli
tourists and ownership of a luxury hotel and resort village at Taba
be decided with the transfer issue. The resorts are now owned by
Israelis.
   ``The order that was to be published Sunday (by Egypt) will
apparently be changed,'' Merhav said. ``We relayed a message to the
Egyptians that a step like this would disrupt the negotiations.''
   Taba, a 250-acre beach area on the Red Sea, has been a subject of
dispute since Israel refused to hand it back to Egypt in 1982. At
that time, Israel withdrew from the rest of the Sinai Peninsula
under terms of the Israel-Egyptian peace treaty.
   Last November, an international arbitration panel delineated the
border, putting Taba in Egyptian territory. But the panel was not
empowered to decide the final boundary line, which Egypt and Israel
were to work out in their own talks.
   Nabil Araby, Egypt's chief negotiator on Taba, on Wednesday said
the land should be returned to Egypt on Sunday, since Israel and
Egypt agreed to adhere to the arbitration ruling 60 days after it
was handed down.
   But Israel Radio said Egypt had backed away from its demand
because of Israeli concern the move would give the Egyptian Tourism
Ministry broad ownership rights over the hotel before the question
of ownership was settled.
   Instead, Israel Radio said, Egypt plans to issue an order
authorizing the Tourism Ministry to negotiate for the hotel's
purchase.

<HEAD>Guards Shut out Local Mayor From U.S. Military Housing Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guards on Thursday kept an inspection team from
entering the construction site of a controversial U.S. military
housing project that local officials have been fighting, a city
official said.
   Mayor Kiichiro Tomino of Zushi and 10 other people went to the
wooded area about 30 miles southwest of Tokyo to check construction
of more than 850 apartment units for U.S. Navy personnel and their
families, said Soichi Takagi, a Zushi official.
   City officials have tried to stop the project, saying it would
jeopardize one of the few remaining wilderness tracts in the Tokyo
area.
   ``Japanese guards employed by U.S. military authorities locked
the gates and refused entry to the city officials, saying the city
should have obtained a permission from proper authorities,'' Takagi
said.
   Tomino argued unsuccessfully that Zushi city has legal authority
to conduct inspections of the 717-acre project and surveys of the
nearby hills, Takagi said. The city of 58,000 people borders on the
naval port city of Yokosuka.
   The Ikego Hills have escaped ravages of development around the
metropolis because they have been off-limits to civilians for the
past 52 years.
   Under the U.S.-Japan security treaty, Japan provides land and
some facilities together with part of the costs for stationing U.S.
servicemen in Japan. About 64,000 U.S. servicemen are based in Japan.

<HEAD>Inventories Down 4 Percent from Year Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle feedlot inventories in the nation's 13
leading beef states totaled 9.41 million head as of Jan. 1, down 4
percent from a year ago but 2 percent more than two years ago, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Only California, Idaho and Kansas showed increases from a year
ago, while decreases were reported in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois,
Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Washington.
Minnesota was unchanged.
   Marketings of fed cattle for slaughter during October, November
and December totaled 5.49 million head, a 2 percent decrease from
the same period of 1987 but 2 percent more than in 1986, the report
said.
   The placement of new cattle and calves on feed during the final
quarter of the year totaled 6.65 million head, down 1 percent from
the previous year and 2 percent fewer than in the same period of
1986.
   Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 5.73 million head
during January, February and March, down 2 percent from last year's
first quarter and off fractionally from 1987, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13
states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef. The
first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Jan. 1,
and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

<HEAD>Colorado Governor Threatens To Close Plant In May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colorado will shut down the federal
government's Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in May unless a new
site is found for its hazardous wastes, Gov. Roy Romer said Thursday.
   The plant, about 16 miles from Denver, is considered a critical
part of the nation's network of nuclear weapons factories. It is the
only plant capable of processing plutonium for nuclear weapons and
is the only fabricator of triggers for nuclear warheads.
   Radioactive waste from Rocky Flats used to be shipped north for
storage at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory. In October,
however, Idaho sealed its borders against the shipments, forcing a
buildup of waste at the Rocky Flats complex.
   ``Our regulations allow only a limited quantity of wastes _ 1,600
cubic yards _ to be stored temporarily on site,'' Romer told the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. ``At the present rate of
waste generation, the plant will exceed this limit sometime in May
1989.''
   ``We must find a solution by May or we aren't going to have
production at Rocky Flats,'' Romer said, adding that he doesn't want
to close the plant but that ``it is an action I will take if I have
to.''
   Romer said another temporary waste storage site, far away from
population centers, must be found quickly.
   A forced shutdown of Rocky Flats would aggravate a growing
problem for the federal government, which last spring lost its only
nuclear reactor capable of making tritium, a perishable gas vital to
making nuclear weapons. That reactor, at the Savannah River Plant
near Aiken, S.C., was closed for safety and technical reasons and is
not expected to be restarted before late 1989.
   Rocky Flats borders a metropolitan area with 1.5 million people.
The plant has just begun the job of gradually reopening the building
that reprocesses plutonium. It was closed last October after some
workers were contaminated.
   Romer said he supports storing the wastes at the unopened Waste
Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, N.M.
   ``I think that ultimately is a safe facility,'' he said.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus complained to the committee about delays
in opening the New Mexico facility.
   Andrus said the Energy Department promised in 1973 it would
remove by 1980 waste temporarily stored in Idaho. That timetable was
pushed back several times until the state finally was told the waste
would be moved out in 1988. When it wasn't, the state drew the line
at 2.4 million cubic feet of material.
   ``We have been lied to for the last time,'' Andrus said. ``Idaho
has kept its part of a difficult bargain but the federal government
and the Department of Energy has not kept its word to us.''
   Andrus, Romer and Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste all urged the Senate
panel to make sure the government didn't turn the nuclear bomb
plants in their states into ``dumps of last resort'' or ``national
sacrifice zones.''
   In response to questioning by the committee chairman, Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, an Environmental Protection Agency official said
``there may be'' some contamination at nuclear plants that is so
severe removing it would be more dangerous than fencing it in as a
sort of isolation area.

<HEAD>Feds Say No Deal to Texas' Hormone-Free Beef</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower
won't be allowed to make an end run around an intercontinental trade
dispute and sell hormone-free beef from Texas to the European
Economic Community, a federal official said Thursday.
   ``It's not going to happen,'' said Roger Bolton, a spokesman for
the U.S. trade representative's office, even as officials of the
Texas Agriculture Department and the EEC continued working on ways
to open trade between Texas beef producers and European importers.
   ``We see no legal ability for them to stop it unless they impose
a formal embargo,'' Hightower said. ``We're taking a states' rights
position. If Ollie North can go run a private war with the applause
of the administration, why are they getting in the way of a few
cattlemen who want to make a sale to our very best customers?''
   Ella Krucoff, spokeswoman for Sir Roy Denman, head of EEC
delegation in Washington, said the EEC was in ``active contact with
the state of Texas. We are interested in maintaining the trade; we
want that trade to be in hormone-free meat.''
   The European Economic Community has banned imports of U.S. beef
and beef products because the meat, worth about $100 million in
sales, contains growth hormones that the EEC contends are a health
threat. The United States disputes those claims and retaliated by
setting about $100 million worth of higher tariffs on various Common
Market products.
   Ms. Krucoff said the EEC would be willing to accept certification
of the meat's purity from Texas authorities if the federal
government is not willing to certify the meat as hormone-free.
   Hightower said the Texas agency has asked acting Agriculture
Secretary Peter Myers to accept a provision with the EEC to certify
beef from Texas and other states for export, but ``we've had no
communication back.''
   The U.S. trade representative's office contends there is no way
Texas can verify the meat as hormone-free, thus effectively
prohibiting its export.

   The troubled Peach Bottom nuclear plant will
use everything from less comfortable chairs to a new shift rotation
to prevent a recurrence of control room operators sleeping on duty,
officials said Thursday.
   About 60 reporters were handed hardhats, goggles and tiny
radiation monitors as Philadelphia Electric Co., operator of the
dormant plant on the Susquehanna River, conducted its first media
tour of the facility.
   The utility is trying to convince the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission that things have changed since the NRC ordered the two
Peach Bottom reactors shut down in March 1987 because of widespread
sleeping and horseplay on the job by control room workers.
   The problems resulted in a $1.25 million fine, largest in NRC
history. Operator negligence was so pervasive that the commission
also levied fines ranging from $500 to $1,000 against 33 current and
former workers for ``sleeping and-or inattention to duty.''
   To combat the catnaps, plant officials said they have replaced
comfortable, high-backed chairs with low-backed models.
   Shift rotations have been changed so that operators work a week
of days, followed by a week of an afternoon-evening shift, and then
work the overnight. The rotation, which includes days off, used to
go in the reverse order.
   The moves are part of a plant shakeup that also includes new top
managers and revamped training courses for control room personnel.
   Peach Bottom officials said they hope to get NRC permission to
restart the plant in late March or April.
   Dave Woodrow, a control room shift supervisor, said the shutdown
has been ``a burden on myself and my family,'' and that operators
were eager to start again. ``We would like to prove to the public
that we are good operators,'' he said.
   Woodrow said sloppiness in the control room may have arisen
partly because Philadelphia Electric was devoting so much attention
to construction of the Limerick II nuclear plant in suburban
Philadelphia.
   ``It was a feeling we were being forgotten,'' he said.
   Efforts to improve worker morale were reflected in improvements
in plant equipment, and even in the distribution of gold-lettered
pens that proclaimed, ``I work at Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station
and I'm proud of it.''
   On-the-job napping was not the only problem at the plant. Since
the shutdown, the NRC also cited deficiencies in Peach Bottom's
security force _ which has recently been replaced _ and said the
plant needed to do a better job cleaning up surface contamination.
   Philadelphia Electric has had to pay about $150 million for
replacement power because of the outage, and Chairman Joseph
Paquette said Thursday, ``Our credibility certainly has been
damaged.''
   But Paquette added: ``We're obviously approaching the finish
line. We did not want the public to come in until we were sure we
had something you'd be impressed with.''
   After submitting background information to plant officials, the
group of reporters touring the plant was shown the control, turbine
and fuel storage rooms, stopping several times to step into phone
booth-sized radiation detectors.
   Peach Bottom is concentrating on getting its 14-year-old Unit 2
into operation first. A second unit would be restarted sometime
afterward.

   Michael Boskin, author of President Bush's
``flexible freeze'' approach to balancing the budget without
increasing taxes, defended the proposal Thursday and said defense
and health care are two areas where he believes spending cuts can be
made.
   Boskin, nominated to be Bush's chief economic adviser, said the
president would provide specific details on how the flexible freeze
will work when he unveils his budget recommendations during an
address to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 9.
   During the presidential campaign, the flexible freeze became
Bush's all-purpose answer to queries on how he planned to increase
spending for a variety of domestic programs while still lowering the
budget deficit without an increase in taxes.
   The flexible freeze would limit the growth in overall federal
spending to the rate of inflation. Any programs allowed to grow at a
faster pace would require offsetting cuts in other areas.
   While Bush mentioned several areas where he would increase
spending, he never specified where the cuts would be made.
   Boskin, who was Bush's principal economic adviser during the
campaign, was pressed during his confirmation hearing Thursday
before the Senate Banking Committee to point out areas where Bush
would recommend cuts.
   ``If there are no new taxes, that means there will have to be
some massive cuts in the federal budget,'' said Sen. Larry Pressler,
R-S.D., who repeatedly asked Boskin to specify ``three or four
areas'' where spending reductions should be made.
   Boskin emphasized that Bush had not made any final decisions on
the budget, but he said he would personally favor reducing the rate
of growth in the defense budget and in the government's health care
costs.
   ``If I was looking for large savings, they would have to come
from areas where there is large spending,'' Boskin said.
   President Reagan's final $1.15 trillion budget for the fiscal
year which begins next Oct. 1 did propose $5 billion in cuts in
Medicare and Medicaid. However, it protected Reagan's defense
buildup, recommending that defense spending authority rise 2 percent
above the rate of inflation.
   Boskin's comments appeared to support the widely held expectation
that Bush will seek cuts in defense to pay for increased spending in
domestic programs to fulfill his campaign promises.
   Boskin, 43, received widespread praise during his confirmation
hearings from senators who said Bush had made an excellent choice in
picking the highly regarded Stanford University economist to lead
the three-member Council of Economic Advisers.
   On other subjects, Boskin said:
   _ Social Security benefits will not be touched in the Bush
budget. Boskin has been a long-time proponent of changes in Social
Security and other middle-class benefit programs, calling them
``welfare for the wealthy.'' But in answering questions from
senators, Boskin said, ``President Bush has made it clear that
Social Security cuts are off the table and I don't advocate any
cuts.''
   _ The Bush budget will accept the basic economic growth
projections on which the Reagan budget was based. Critics have
charged that the administration's growth, interest rate and
inflation forecasts are too optimistic and the economy's actual
performance will make it impossible to meet the deficit goals. The
budget budget projects a 1990 budget deficit of $92.5 billion, below
the $100 billion target established by the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law.
   _ The president remains committed to his pledge not to increase
taxes. Boskin said the proposal being considered to raise revenues
to deal with the savings and loan crisis by imposing a fee on
depositors at S&amp;Ls and other financial institutions could be
considered a user fee imposed on depositors for the protection they
recieve from having the federal government insure their savings.
   The Council of Economic Advisers, created in 1946 to advise the
president, fell on hard times during the Reagan administration. At
one point, the president considered abolishing the panel after his
advisers grew disenchanted with former Chairman Martin Feldstein's
suggestions that tax increases should be considered because of the
huge budget deficits.
   Boskin said he had been assured he would play a major role in
helping to formulate policy in the new administration and intended
to make suggestions to fill the other two spots on the panel as
quickly as possible.

<TEXT>
   President Bush called government ``an
opportunity for public service, not private gain'' Thursday as he
urged senior federal executives to uphold high ethical standards.
   ``Our principles are clear _ that government service is a noble
calling and a public trust,'' Bush told 3,700 members of the Senior
Executive Service. ``This administration is dedicated to ethics in
government and the need for honorable men and women to serve in
positions of trust.''
   Bush chose his first speech outside the White House as president
to re-emphasize a theme he has been sounding all week.
   The president, speaking at Constitution Hall, an auditorium owned
by the Daughters of the American Revolution, also pledged to make
federal jobs ``more challenging, more satisfying and more
fulfilling.''
   Although most of Bush's Cabinet was present, as were many other
top-level political appointees, the bulk of the audience was
comprised of career civil servants.
   Bush said, ``We're all wise in the ways of Washington, especially
you who have served this country with such distinction.''
   ``We know there are ups and downs,'' he said. But he added, ``I
must say, there is a nice feeling around today in the country. I
think people, when a new president comes in, do root for him
regardless of partisan politics.''
   Bush's voice was noticeably raspy as he spoke. Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said the president had a head cold.
   As he has before, Bush offered straightforward advice for
avoiding conflicts of interest: ``simply to know right from wrong.''
   ``Our duty is to serve, and my strong conviction is that we must
do it only for the right reasons. ... Government should be an
opportunity for public service, not private gain.''
   Bush gave similar talks earlier this week in separate meetings
with his Cabinet and with his White House staff. And, on Wednesday,
he appointed an eight-member commission to recommend by March 9 a
new code of ethics for government officials.

   The Commerce Department on Thursday ruled that
Japanese all-terrain vehicles are being sold in the United States at
less than fair value and proposed anti-dumping duties to erase the
price advantage.
   The duties would affect Japanese exports of certain three- and
four-wheel vehicles designed for off-the-road use by one person, the
department said.
   The money is to be held as a cash deposit or bond while the U.S.
International Trade Commission determines if the imports injure or
threaten to injure U.S. manufacturers. The panel has 45 days to make
a decision.
   If the ITC rules there is injury, the Commerce Department would
issue a final order instructing the Customs Service to collect the
anti-dumping duties.
   The proposed anti-dumping duties vary, based on the gap between
what it cost Japanese companies to make the vehicles and the lower
prices they charged in the United States.
   The proposed duties are: Honda, 32.89 percent; Yamaha, 8.47
percent; Suzuki, 14.12 percent; Kawasaki, 35.43 percent; and all
others, 24.59 percent.
   Imports of all-terrain vehicles from Japan in 1987 were valued at
$534.4 million.

<TEXT>
   The Navy destroyer USS Spruance ran aground
during anti-submarine warfare exercises near Andros Island in the
Bahamas, the Navy said Thursday.
   No one was injured in the Wednesday night incident, but the
563-foot ship had minor damage, said Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd, a
spokesman at Atlantic Fleet surface force headquarters in Norfolk,
Va.
   Lloyd said the ship, based in Mayport, is in no danger of
sinking. The guided missile frigate USS Boone and Navy tugs were
working to refloat the Spruance, and divers were conducting an
inspection, officials said.
   The Navy was investigating the cause of the mishap. Lloyd said
winds were blowing about 30 mph when the ship ran aground and
continued strong with gusts up to 35 mph Thursday.
   The ship, more than twice the size of World War II destroyers,
left Mayport on Tuesday and had been scheduled to return Friday. The
vessel was commissioned on September 1975 and carries a crew of 20
officers and 267 enlisted men.
   The underwater warfare training takes place in a deep-water
trough east of Andros. The are, where water is as deep as 8,000 feet
or more, is fringed by reef-filled shallows.
   Andros, the largest of the Bahamian islands, is about 180 miles
east of Key West, Fla. The grounding occurred three miles from of a
Navy pier on the island, which is home to the Navy's Atlantic
Undersea Test and Evaluation Center.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev probably will
be ousted because he has failed to seek popular support in direct
elections, Andrei D. Sakharov and his wife were quoted as saying in
an interview published Thursday.
   ``The conservatives will overthow Gorbachev or at least impose
their views on him,'' the conservative French daily Le Figaro quoted
Sakharov, the dean of the Soviet human rights movement, as saying.
   Le Figaro said the six-hour interview with Sakharov and his wife,
Yelena Bonner, also a prominent rights activist, was conducted over
three consecutive evenings at their Moscow home.
   The newspaper quoted Bonner as saying: ``The only real defense
for a chief of state is direct election. Why is Gorbachev afraid? We
would elect him. Our country has no other leader.
   ``I think he will be overthrown soon,'' she was quoted as saying.
``I would not bet 10 rubles on Gorbachev.''
   Bonner said that if Gorbachev is ousted, ``so will (be) all those
who believed in perestroika,'' his program to restructure Soviet
society and its economy, the paper reported.
   Sakharov, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, said the West
must continue to pressure the Soviet Union on rights issues, at
least until an international human rights conference that is
scheduled in Moscow in 1991.
   He said the meeting, which initially was opposed by Britain and
the United States, ``should only take place if the (human rights)
situation in the Soviet Union is truly satisfactory.''
   Le Figaro quoted Sakharov as saying that perestroika was
``absolutely necessary. There is no other solution. This doesn't
mean that you have to support Gorbachev without reservation. To
associate perestroika 100 percent with his name would not be fair.
   ``Gorbachev could come under pressure. He could have other
ideas,'' Sakharov was quoted as saying. ``The restructuring has to
be supported in general without worrying whether some people are
going to be upset. For the Soviet individual today, the question of
collective rights is more immediate than individual rights.''
   He was quoted as saying he did not like the new electoral law,
which only allows officially sanctioned organizations to nominate
candidates for the new people's congress.
   He said he also disliked another new law designed to allow
authorities to break up meetings and demonstrations and to arrest
Armenian nationalist leaders, Le Figaro reported.
   Sakharov described his visit last month to the adjacent southern
Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, which are embroiled in
an ethnic dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely Armenian enclave
in Azerbaijan.
   ``It was terrifying,'' he was quoted as saying. ``A pregnant
woman was raped, burned alive, stabbed and her fetus thrown on the
sidewalk during the three-day siege of an Armenian family, then she
was killed.''
   Most Armenians are Christians, and most Azerbaijanis are Moslems.
Historical enmity between the two ethnic groups has broken out
periodically.
   Sakharov also was quoted as saying the number of Soviet Jews
denied exit visas ``has been considerably reduced, but the
legislation has not yet been changed.''

   The nation's soybean farmers are still being
affected by crop prospects in Brazil and Argentina, an Agriculture
Department report said Thursday.
   Combined production of the two countries is forecast at 31
million metric tons, up 3.3 million tons from last year, the
department's Economic Research Service said.
   ``However, prospects are more uncertain this year because of
delayed plantings in both countries and dry weather, especially in
Argentina,'' the report said. ``The size of the South American crop
will influence soybean prices and U.S. plantings in 1989.''
   U.S. soybean production last year, the lowest since 1976, dropped
to about 1.54 billion bushels, or 41.9 million tons. A metric ton is
about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of soybeans.

   Manuel Lujan, President Bush's choice for
interior secretary, told senators Thursday he is ``committed to
protecting and enhancing'' the nation's natural resources, but said
that doesn't preclude some development.
   ``We can do both. We do not have to choose between them,''
declared Lujan, whose Senate confirmation is expected without major
controversy.
   Lujan, who spent 20 years representing New Mexico as a
congressman, received a warm reception from both Democrats and
Republicans on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
which is expected to send his name to Senate floor for a vote,
probably next week.
   One of two Hispanics selected by Bush for his Cabinet, Lujan
reminded the committee he is a westerner who grew up ``where
reverence for the beauty and the sanctity of our land was instilled
in me from the earliest days of my youth.''
   Lujan's childhood was spent on land that is now an Indian
reservation, said the 60-year-old former congressman. As interior
secretary he would oversee the Bureau of Indian Affairs and, in
response to a question, said he would become personally involved if
he heard of any native Americans being treated insensitively.
   But Lujan's nomination has received only lukewarm endorsement
from most environmental and conservation groups, who complain that
in 20 years in Congress he voted against environmental interests on
a number of occasions.
   Some of those votes have raised ``signals ... that you are not
sympathetic to environmental legislation,'' said Sen. Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore., citing specifically Lujan's vote against legislation,
sponsored by Hatfield, which expanded wilderness areas.
   Lujan defended his record on environmental and conservation
matters and said he and Bush ``are committed to protecting and
enhancing the nation's natural resources, as well as proceeding with
their environmentally sound development.''
   Noting that some of these issues are highly controversial, Lujan
said, ``we all need to lower our voices so that we can hear each
other.''
   ``Development of our most promising domestic resources is called
for because continued development is essential to the national
security and economic well being of the United States,'' he said.
   ``At the same time, we will oppose development in those
environmentally sensitive areas where the risk of damage is great,''
he continued.
   Environmental groups have raised concern about the possibility of
oil and drilling on the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in
northeastern Alaska and have noted that Lujan sponsored legislation
in the last Congress that would have allowed such drilling.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., noted that ``the lines are already
being drawn'' on the question of whether oil companies should be
allowed onto the Alaska refuge.
   Lujan said he was ``not happy'' that ``we're starting off in a
confrontational way'' as far as the wildlife drilling question is
concerned, suggesting that some of the difference might be worked
out through discussions and compromise.
   Oil and gas development in the refuge would require congressional
approval. Lujan said while he favored such development, he is
opposed to a land swap deal suggested by the Reagan administration.

   A leftist coalition on Thursday
accused the government of hiding behind the constitution to prevent
the Marxist-led guerrilla movement from taking part in the March
presidential election.
   ``This is the moment for the political parties to demonstrate
whether they want peace or bones,'' Guillermo Ungo, presidential
candidate of the leftist Democratic Convergence, told a news
conference.
   The guerrillas, who have been fighting the U.S.-backed government
for nine years, offered Tuesday to take part in elections if certain
conditions were met. The rebels previously have boycotted all five
elections held this decade.
   The insurgents' proposal dropped their longstanding insistence on
sharing power in a transitional government, the major stumbling
block in three rounds of unsuccessful peace talks between 1984 and
1987.
   The guerrillas' main condition for participation was postponement
of presidential elections from March 19 to September.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte, a Christian Democrat, and the
rightist opposition Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena,
rejected the rebel proposal as unconstitutional.
   The constitution says presidential elections must be held no
later than two months before the end of the five-year presidential
term. Duarte's term ends June 1.
   ``The constitutional problem invoked by some seems to us no more
than a pretext to prolong the war and impede the advent of peace,''
the Democratic Convergence said in a communique.
   Ungo and Ruben Zamora, another Democratic Convergence leader,
presented a constitutional solution to the election date quandary.
   ``The problem is not constitutional, it is one of lack of
political will,'' said Zamora.
   Convergence members said parties contesting the elections could
force a postponement by withdrawing from the March balloting.
   ``The absence of candidates would prevent the holding of
elections,'' said Ungo. He cited the constitutional provision for
election by the legislature of an interim president who would serve
until elections are held.
   ``The constitution exists to serve the people, as an instrument
providing for peace and coexistence _ not to impede peace and
coexistence,'' said Ungo.
   Zamora said the Christian Democrats and rightists ``are using the
constitution as a skirt to hide behind.''
   Arena candidate Alfredo Cristiani led Christian Democratic
candidate Fidel Chavez Mena in recent polls. Ungo is running a
distant third, according to the polls.
   The guerrillas said they would throw their support behind the
Democratic Convergence candidates if their conditions of
participation were met.
   The coalition, in its press conference, cited examples of
repeated violation of the country's charter under the current
government.
   For example, the constitution requires security forces to obtain
a search warrant before entering a citizen's home. But army troops
and police regularly sweep through entire working class
neighborhoods, entering homes and going through drawers and personal
belongings without warrants.

   Yasser Arafat will not request a U.S. visa in
order to address an Arab-American group and will visit the United
States only if he gets an official invitation, an aide said Thursday.
   The PLO chairman arrived in Spain from Iraq on Thursday to meet
with the foreign ministers of Spain, France and Greece in his
campaign for international peace conference on the Middle East.
   Those countries have been assigned by the 12-member European
Economic Community to gather support for a U.N.-sponsored
conference. The Israeli government opposes such a forum and wants
direct negotiations with Arab countries, but refuses to deal with
the PLO.
   Abdeen Jabara, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee, said this month the group had invited Arafat to speak at
its April meeting and he had accepted.
   In his comments in Cairo on Thursday, Nabil Shaath did not
explain why Arafat changed his mind beyond saying the Palestine
Liberation Organization chief ``said he will not go on an invitation
from an unofficial group.''
   Shaath, a top political adviser, said Arafat would accept only an
official invitation from Washington.
   The United States refused Arafat's request for a visa to address
the U.N. General Assembly in December, saying he condoned terrorism,
and the assembly moved its session from New York to Geneva.
   After a Geneva news conference in which Arafat renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist, the United States
began talks with PLO officials in Tunisia.
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization and has
bitterly criticized the decision by its principal ally.
   A diplomat in Madrid said privately Thursday: ``It's no secret
the United States is the only party that has any influence over
Israel. What the EEC is trying to do is send a message to
Washington.''
   Another said it ``would not be surprising'' if Arafat requested
EEC recognition of a Palestinian state during his meeting Friday
with Foreign Ministers Francisco Fernandez Ordonez of Spain, Roland
Dumas of France and Carolos Papoulias of Greece.
   The Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO
legislature, proclaimed an independent Palestinian state Nov. 15 at
a session in Tunis. The EEC reacted favorably but did not extend
official recognition.
   Spain holds the rotating presidency of the trading bloc for the
first six months of 1989.

<HEAD>NRC Staff Recommends Action To Improve Reactor Safety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The protective containment shells on nearly
one-quarter of the nation's commercial nuclear reactors should be
modified to reduce the risk of rupture during a major accident, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff said Thursday.
   But the staff, making the recommendation to the commission, said
the containment vessels, known as Mark I and built by General
Electric Co., posed no immediate danger to public health or safety.
   The commission took no action and said it would meet soon with an
NRC advisory panel that earlier this week said the proposed
modifications were unjustified.
   The plant owners have generally opposed past suggestions of
modifying the containment shells, although the Pilgrim nuclear
reactor at Plymouth, Mass., over the last year has voluntarily
performed all the actions now being urged by the NRC staff.
   Victor Stello, the NRC's executive director of operations, told
the commissioners that the modifications would cost no more than
$150 million for all 24 plants involved, and that the financial
burden was more than offset by safety gains.
   He added, however, ``We do not believe there is any particular
problem that requires precipitous action.''
   The Mark I containments have been singled out for attention by
the NRC because studies have shown them to be more vulnerable to
failure during a reactor accident than other containment systems. A
containment failure could lead to the release of dangerous amounts
of radioactivity into the atmosphere around the reactor.
   The probability of a reactor core meltdown in a Mark I
containment in any given years is estimated at between one-in-10,000
and one-in-100,000 _ not appreciably different than the risk for the
industry as a whole, said Bill Beckner, the NRC's chief of severe
accident issues.
   As recently as 1986, NRC officials said the Mark I containment
system was likely to fail in nine out of 10 severe accidents, such
as a core meltdown. Commission experts said Thursday, however, that
the chances of failure were now believed to be much lower, although
they said there was wide disagreement on exact odds.
   Lando W. Zech, the NRC chairman, said, ``We should take our
time'' in deciding whether to require the changes to 24 of the
nation's 110 operating reactors. He suggested that pressure to act
quickly could lead to new safety problems.
   ``We want to improve safety, not detract from it,'' he said.
   Anti-nuclear groups have called for quick action to improve
safety at the Mark I facilities.
   ``The way it looks now, I don't see them (the NRC) doing
anything,'' Kenneth Boley, a nuclear safety analyst at the
anti-nuclear group Public Citizen, said in an interview after the
commission meeting.
   Among the modifications recommended by the NRC staff is the
installation of hard pipe vents that would relieve severe pressure
resulting from damage to a reactor core.
   Stello said four or five of the 24 Mark I facilities already have
the improved their venting systems. He did not say which plants were
involved.
   The commission staff also called for the provision of an
alternate water supply with pumping capability independent of the
normal and existing emergency power system. It also said emergency
procedures and training should be improved.
   Here are the 24 reactors with Mark I containments:
   _Browns Ferry (three reactors), Decatur, Ala., owned by Tennessee
Valley Authority.
   _Brunswick (two reactors), Southport, N.C., Carolina Power &amp;
Light Co.
   _Cooper, Brownsville, Neb., Nebraska Public Power District.

   There is no way to prevent another leak of
chemicals stored at the abandoned Artel Chemical Co. plant, said a
federal Environmental Protection Agency official investigating two
leaks in the last week.
   ``I believe we will be experiencing these things over and over
until the warm weather is over,'' said Jerry Saseen, the EPA's
coordinator of the Artel Chemical cleanup.
   Saseen and Nitro Mayor Don Karnes both blame unseasonably warm
weather for a leak Wednesday night and a leak Jan. 19. Temperatures
have been fluctuating from the 20s and 30s to the 50s and 60s during
a January warm spell.
   In each case, moisture built up in a sealed 55-gallon drum, and
the water reacted with the substance inside to create a cloud of
chemical vapor.
   No injuries were reported in either accident, but both times
nearby traffic was blocked and residents were asked to stay in their
homes.
   ``I guess this could happen two or three times a day,'' Karnes
said. ``I hope it doesn't. There are a lot of chemicals over there.''
   The EPA on Thursday still was trying to determine exactly what
was in the drum of waste acid that leaked Wednesday.
   There was a danger the substance could cause problems with
thousands of other drums of chemicals at the EPA Superfund site,
Saseen said.
   ``The lid blew off, and since it was acid, we wanted to stop any
corrosion of the other drums, so we dusted it with soda ash,''
Karnes said.
   Cleanup crews could begin moving more than 5,000 drums of toxic
and hazardous chemicals from the abandoned plant as early as
mid-February, said EPA official Doug Fox. The plant was closed and
turned over to the EPA in June after the federal government declared
it a public health hazard.
   EPA crews were still sampling the drums to find out exactly what
was stored at the site, Saseen said.
   The leak last week involved thionyl chloride, which reacted with
water and released hydrochloric acid and sulfur dioxide, which can
be deadly in high amounts, the EPA said.

   Random drug testing for key personnel,
including astronauts, will start in March at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the chief of the agency
announced Thursday.
   NASA administrator James C. Fletcher said a system of random drug
testing will be applied to all employees in sensitive positions,
including senior level management, astronauts, flight controllers,
researchers and engineers.
   Additionally, Fletcher said in a NASA announcement, ``drug
testing may be required if there is a reasonable suspicion of
illegal drug use or an accident or unsafe practice.''
   Fletcher said because of the ``limited scope of drug abuse in the
agency,'' the NASA drug program will emphasize education, training
and assistance through the NASA Employee Assistance Program for
employees ``who may be experiencing a problem related to such drug
use.''
   ``NASA recognizes that drug abuse is debilitating and that
prolonged illegal drug use makes it progressively more difficult for
the individual to refrain from such drug use,'' Fletcher said.
   Dwayne Brown, a NASA spokesman, said the drug program is
scheduled to start March 27, which is 60 days from the date of
Fletcher's announcement.
   Fletcher said the new drug program is in support of an executive
order from the Reagan administration that calls for a drug-free
federal workplace.

   Soviet spies are flourishing as
relations between the two superpowers improve, said a former
high-ranking Soviet KGB officer who defected to the United States.
   ``The nicer the relationship between the United States and the
Soviet Union, the more aggressive Soviet intelligence is,''
Stanislav Levchenko told the Palm Beach Round Table on Wednesday.
   ``Soviets know Americans very well,'' said Levchenko, who
defected to U.S. authorities 10 years ago in Tokyo, where he spent
four years as a major in the KGB. ``The better the relationship, the
kinder, more open-hearted Americans become. Americans are very
trustworthy people.''
   The 47-year-old former spy said one of the first things he
learned upon joining the KGB was that his colleagues were nothing
like those in the movies.
   In films, ``basically, you understand within five minutes who the
good guys are because they look good and bad guys look bad,'' he
said. ``What I learned unfortunately was that bad guys looked like
good guys and sometimes much better.''
   MICE is the international acronym in the espionage world for the
four means of recruiting agents and informants, Levchenko said. The
letters stand for money, ideology, compromise and ego.
   ``It's a very real thing that is going on,'' he said. ``The
Soviet intelligence against this country is dramatically growing and
expanding.''

<TEXT>
   A senior Vietnamese diplomat held discussions
with Bush administration officials Thursday as part of what is
believed to be the first visit ever by a Hanoi representative to
Washington.
   The occasion for the visit by Trinh Xuan Lang, Vietnam's
ambassador to the United Nations, was a reception Thursday night
sponsored by a non-profit group, Sightsavers International, which
seeks to train foreign doctors in eye surgery techniques.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the administration
waived rules limiting the envoy's travels to the New York City area
so he could attend the reception.
   But the administration took advantage of Lang's presence to raise
with him U.S. concerns about American servicemen still missing from
the Vietnam war.
   The Thursday afternoon meeting included officials from the
National Security Council, the State Department and the Pentagon.
There also was a representative of the National League of Families,
which is comprised of relatives of the missing servicemen.
   Redman noted there has been increased cooperation between the
United States and Vietnam in obtaining an accounting for the more
than 1,700 Americans still missing in Vietnam.
   ``We want to make sure that the Vietnamese continue to understand
our concerns,'' Redman said.
   A State Department official, asking not to be identified, said
that as far as he knew, no Hanoi representative has ever visited
Washington since the northern half of what is now Vietnam became
independent from France in 1954.
   The two Vietnams became united after the pro-U.S. Saigon
government was defeated by the north in 1975.
   Vietnam is one of a handful of countries with which the United
States does not have diplomatic relations. When the State Department
official was told that Lang's visit to Washington could be seen as a
conciliatory gesture to Hanoi by the new administration, the
official said that ``appearances are deceiving.''
   He reaffirmed an earlier assertion by Redman that the Bush
administration is applying the same criteria as the previous
administration for normalizing relations with Vietnam.
   According to that policy, there will be no obstacle to
normalization of relations once the Vietnamese complete their troop
withdrawal from Cambodia.
   At the same time, the administration also attaches significance
to continuing cooperation by Hanoi in obtaining an accounting for
the missing American servicemen.

<TEXT>
   Experts from six OPEC nations and seven independent
oil producers agreed Thursday to recommend further steps for
bolstering world oil prices, but stopped short of making specific
plans for cooperation.
   Oil ministers from both sides will meet at a yet-undecided date
for further discussion on the issue, OPEC General Secretary Subroto
told reporters after the daylong closed meeting.
   The non-OPEC countries also stated in a communique that they
supported OPEC's goal of achieving a target price of $18 a barrel
``as soon as possible.''
   ``They agreed on the need to take further steps to enhance
improvements already achieved and to further strengthen the oil
market, especially in the second quarter of 1989,'' the communique
read.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been trying
to enlist the support of non-OPEC producers since the cartel agreed
at its November ministerial meeting to curtail its own production in
order to boost prices.
   Since the OPEC agreement prices have moved higher, and the chief
U.S. crude _ West Texas Intermediate _ sporadically has topped $18 a
barrel in recent futures trading.
   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, fell to $16.25 a barrel Thursday night,
down 43 cents from late Wednesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate plunged 40 cents to settle at $17.72 a barrel,
the lowest level of Thursday's session. The contract had jumped 58
cents on Wednesday.
   The communique did not specify possible steps for supporting
prices, although Subroto said a 5 percent production cut ``is an
option.''
   Non-OPEC sources had speculated some of the independent producers
might offer to cut their collective production by 5 percent without
requesting reciprocal cuts from OPEC.
   The two sides said they also agreed ``this initial effort should
be continued in the second half of the year and consolidated
thereafter to establish a more permanent, long-term cooperation for
achieving durable oil market stability...''
   Analysts said the futures markets may have been disappointed by
the lack of concrete plans.
   ``They didn't recommend any specific action,'' said Nauman
Barakat, vice president of energy investments at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York. ``Their statement was so vague that it
didn't really mean anything.''
   The attending OPEC nations were Kuwait, Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
Indonesia, Venezuela and Nigeria. The other OPEC members are
Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates.
   The communique from the independents said the non-OPEC group
consisted of representatives of Angola, China, Colombia, Egypt,
Malaysia, Mexico, and Oman and observers from the Soviet Union,
Norway, the Yemen Arab Republic, the Canadian province of Alberta
and the U.S. states of Alaska and Texas.
   OPEC members agreed in November to limit their production to 18.5
million barrels a day, effective Jan. 1.
   OPEC members are producing an estimated 19.5 million barrels a
day, down as much as 3.5 million barrels a day from the fourth
quarter. That has helped oil prices recover from around $12 a barrel
in December.

   A synagogue dropped plans to be host for a
rally against former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke's state House
campaign, the congregation's rabbi said Thursday.
   ``Very strong feelings against the meeting from the members of
the congregation and the community in general has forced
reconsideration,'' said Rabbi Gavriel Newman of Congregation Beth
Israel. ``It is our judgment that any efforts to clarify to the
community to how dangerous David Duke is to Louisiana would forge
support for him from those who agree with his viewpoints.''
   Mordechai Levy, head of the New York-based Jewish Defense
Organization, earlier Thursday had announced plans for the Feb. 14
rally. Levy said the rally would be a ``peaceful and legal mass
meeting to derail and hopefully ruin the Duke campaign.''
   Newman said Levy's earlier statements that his group would not
rule out violence in its efforts against Duke were a factor in the
decision to cancel the rally.
   ``We still feel that it is essential that people understand that
David Duke, having a history of racism and bigotry, is an extremely
dangerous man.''
   Duke, 38, former imperial wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, led a field of seven candidates in the Jan. 21 primary
election for the House seat in the mostly white suburban New Orleans
area. He faces John Treen, 62, in a Feb. 18 runoff.
   Levy said after learning of Newman's decision that he was trying
to find another synagogue for the rally.
   Levy said earlier this week that the JDO would take any means
necessary, including violence, to disrupt Duke's campaign.

   Rival Shiite Moslem militias fought a
30-minute gunbattle in the south Beirut slums Thursday before Syrian
patrols moved in to stop it, police reported.
   A police spokesman said there was no casualty report. Each side
blamed the other for the fight between the Syrian-backed Amal
militia and the pro-Iranian fundamentalists of Hezbollah, or Party
of God.
   Officials of Syria and Iran, which are allies but have
conflicting interests in Lebanon, have been meeting in Damascas in
an effort to end a power struggle between the militias. A
``preliminary'' cease-fire was proclaimed Wednesday but collapsed
within hours.
   Syria has 40,000 soldiers stationed in Lebanon and is the
war-ravaged nation's main power broker.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting in Beirut and south Lebanon
since last April for supremacy among the 1 million Shiites, the
country's largest sect. Nearly 700 people have been reported killed
and more than 1,800 wounded.
   Two Moslem leaders left for Tunis on Thursday for talks with an
Arab League committee on how to end a political crisis that could
cement the sectarian division resulting from nearly 13 years of
civil war.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads a
Moslem cabinet vying for power with a rival Christian government,
and Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite, are to meet with
the committee Monday.
   In south Lebanon, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir paid a
three-hour visit to Israel's ``security zone'' just north of its
frontier, which is patrolled by soldiers and a predominantly
Christian surrogate militia.
   He told Israeli soldiers at a post on the zone's northern edge:
``The small units of soldiers here who are guarding the border .. .
are fully carrying out their duties. There is security in the
country, on the northern borders and the settlements.''
   Israel established the zone, which ranges in depth from six to 10
miles, after withdrawing in June 1985 from a three-year invasion and
occupation of Lebanon.

<HEAD>Don't Cut Corporate Buyout Deductions: Greenspan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged
Congress Thursday not to reduce tax deductions for interest paid on
bonds and loans used to finance corporate takeovers.
   Greenspan told the Senate Finance Committee that restricting
deductions for interest paid on high-yield bonds and other debt to
finance leveraged buyouts, takeover defenses and corporate
restructuring ``would create adverse secondary consequences.''
   In response to questions, however, Greenspan said it is not
possible to ``figure out in advance'' what the consequences of
tax-law changes would be and acknowledged, ``If it were done over a
long period of time, I suspect the market implications would not be
large.''
   Greenspan's comments conflicted with comments by Bush and Reagan
administration officials who have put part of the blame for the
October 1987 stock market crash on an aborted attempt then by the
Ways and Means Committee to modestly restrict interest deductions on
debts incurred in corporate restructurings.
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman David Ruder warned
the Finance Committee on Wednesday that tampering with the tax code
could create another panic in a ``skittish and nervous'' stock
market.
   Both the Finance and Ways and Means committees are re-examining
leveraged buyouts in the wake of the pending $25 billion purchase of
RJR Nabisco Co. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and the $13 billion
buyout of Kraft Inc. by Phillip Morris Co. last year.
   Those were the biggest two of more than 300 leveraged buyouts
totaling nearly $100 billion in 1988.
   Two weeks before he took office, President Bush, in discussing
buyouts, left open the possibility of changing the way the tax laws
treat dividends and deductions for interest payments on junk bonds.
   A leveraged buyout is similar to a person buying an automobile on
credit with a very small down payment. In the case of the auto
purchase, a three- to five-year loan is secured by the value of the
car being bought.
   With a leveraged buyout or restructuring of a corporation,
high-interest junk bonds secured by the company's assets are issued
to buy stock from shareholders at premiums 45 percent or more above
its market price beforehand.
   To cover the interest payments, the new owners often have to cut
back on research, sell off some assets or divisions, close stores or
plants, lay off workers or cut their pay and and reduce pension
contributions.
   Congress in 1986 voted to gradually end the tax deductions for
interest paid on car loans and other consumer credit purchases, but
left in place deductions for home mortgages and virtually all
corporate debt.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland told the committee that Congress
should make ``similar discriminations with regard to the
deductibility of interest on the various types of corporate debt.''
   Kirkland estimated that mergers, takeovers and leveraged buyouts
this decade have directly cost 90,000 union workers their jobs and
forced thousands of others to suffer cuts in their wages and
benefits.
   ``While the rest of the industrialized world soberly invests in
the future, our financial elite _ with the complicity of major
banks, brokerage firms, investment house and prestigious law firms _
is engaged in drunken short-term speculative revels,'' Kirkland said.
   ``The government should not be subsidizng these questionable
deals by providing tax subsidies, but this is precisely what the tax
code does,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Hijackings Foiled in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One man brandished a torch and demanded to be flown
abroad and another threatened to blow up a passenger plane in two
unsuccessful attempts to hijack Soviet planes, news reports said
Thursday.
   The latest in a series of attempted skyjackings occurred Saturday
at the airport in the Ukrainian city of Ivano-Frankovsk, the
government daily Izvestia reported.
   As an Antonov-24 began taxiing onto the runway for a flight to
Kiev, a passenger ignited a homemade torch and demanded a flight
abroad, the paper said.
   The aircraft stopped and a stewardess, passengers and a pilot
subdued the would-be hijacker, according to Izvestia. A fire that
had started in the cabin was quickly extinguished, and two
passengers and the pilot were slightly burned, Izvestia said. A
34-year-old man, S. Zemskov, was arrested.
   The hijacking attempt came one day after a similiar incident
aboard a Tupolev-134 flying from the Russian city of Archangel to
the Ukrainian cities of Kiev and Odessa.
   As the plane began its descent Friday over the Black Sea to
Odessa, a man threatened to blow up the aircraft unless it was
diverted to either Bucharest, Romania, or Israel, the newspaper
reported.
   The pilot promised to meet the demand after refueling in Odessa.
Izvestia said a policeman boarded the plane in Odessa and traded
himself for the rest of the passengers.
   Two hours later, 36-year-old N. Kotsyuban, a mental hospital
patient, was arrested, the newspaper reported.
   The report did not describe how the man was arrested or say how
many passengers were aboard either aircraft. It also did not explain
the delay in reporting the hijacking attempts.
   Hijackings have been rare in the Soviet Union, but recently there
have been several.
   Last month, four air pirates commandeered a school bus, boarded
an Ilyushin 76-T transport plane and flew to Israel. They were
arrested in Israel and returned to the Soviet Union.
   In March of last year, a family jazz band hijacked a plane flying
from the Siberian city of Irkutsk, and soldiers stormed the aircraft
after it landed near Leningrad. Five of the hijackers, three other
passengers and a stewardess died in the assault.

<HEAD>Elite Scientific Panel Briefed on Accelerator Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elite panel of scientists, whose advice to
the Department of Defense is often cloaked in secrecy, has received
a briefing from researchers who believe a linear accelerator may be
a cheaper, safer and quicker way to produce tritium than building
new reactors.
   The Defense Department has consulted the panel, known as the
``JASON Group,'' on military projects involving complex technologies
since 1959.
   The briefing, late last week in La Jolla, Calif., was made by
researchers from the Los Alamos and Brookhaven national laboratories
and the Westinghouse-Hanford Co. who for more than a year have been
exploring the possibility of using an accelerator to produce tritium
_ a key ingredient in nuclear weapons.
   ``They seemed to be very enthusiastic and highly supportive of
the idea,'' said William Kato, chairman of the Department of Nuclear
Energy at Brookhaven.
   Kato said that the normal practice of the group would be to write
a report that ``I assume would go to the Department of Defense and
Department of Energy.''
   Others who attended the briefing, but asked not to be identified,
said the presentation marked the first time the accelerator concept
had been presented to an independent, technical review team.
   Kato said the presentation was similar to one made to Department
of Energy officials in Washington last August.
   The Energy Department, which builds nuclear weapons for the
military, is proceeding with plans to construct two new tritium
producing reactors.
   A top official of the Energy Department told a Senate committee
on Wednesday that the department felt technology was not ``mature''
enough to use a linear accelerator rather than a nuclear reactor to
produce tritium.
   An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target,
in this case lithium clad in aluminum. The resulting collision
produces tritium, a radioactive gas used in nuclear weapons.
   The nation's existing tritium producing reactors, located at the
Savannah River complex in South Carolina, have been beset with
safety problems and are currently shut down.
   Chris Sankey, a department spokeswoman, said Thursday that as a
``long-range option to augment, not replace our plans for two new
production reactors, we may undertake additional evaluation of the
accelerator concept. That would take place when a concrete proposal
is presented to the department.''
   The JASON Group is composed of about 55 scientists who do
``sophisticated scientific research and analysis in support of the
national security community,'' said Jan Bodanyi, a spokeswoman for
the Defense Department.
   Ms. Bodanyi said most members are physicists and include Nobel
laureates and other highly respected scientists.
   he group has studied such other problems as designing the
Strategic Defense Initiative and detecting plastic guns, said Ms.
Bodanyi.

   The Defense Department on Thursday lifted its
contracting suspension of the Sundstrand Corp. after the company
agreed to repay $62.3 million to the Pentagon and to make other
cost-saving concessions on future contracts.
   The payments and concessions, which involve accounting
procedures, would be in addition to the $115 million the company
agreed to pay the government last October in settling a federal
fraud investigation.
   The $115 million agreement already had been described as the
largest single fraud settlement in history.
   ``The Defense Logistics Agency has lifted the suspension of
Sundstrand Corp. from bidding on government contracts following a
settlement of administrative issues,'' the Pentagon said.
   ``Sundstrand Corp. has agreed to repay the government $62.3
million in cash and make accounting changes that will result in
additional savings in the future.''
   Larry Wilson, a spokesman for the Defense Logistics Agency, said
the new agreement called for Sundstrand to make an immediate cash
payment of $40 million; a separate payment of $9.9 million ``on or
before Sept. 1,'' and payments totaling $12.4 million ``to be made
in equal annual installments of $2.48 million over the next five
years.''
   Wilson said the accounting changes would provide the Pentagon, in
effect, with some price guarantees on future contracts because it
would force the company to modify the way it allocates charges
between its commercial and military work.
   Those savings could eventually total another $34 million, Wilson
said.
   The Pentagon suspended Sundstrand from doing any new business
with the federal government on Oct. 19, saying it wasn't satisfied
with the company's response to being caught up in a fraud
investigation overseen by the U.S. attorney in Chicago.
   While the suspension did not affect existing contracts, it
prevented the corporation and six subsidiaries _ Sundstrand Data
Control Inc.; Falk Corp.; Sundstrand Heat Transfer Inc.; Sundstrand
Service Corp.; Sullair Corp., and Signatron Inc. _ from bidding on
or receiving any new contracts.
   The Rockford, Ill.-based company, a manufacturer of electronic,
mechanical and hydraulic systems for aircraft, on Oct. 12 agreed to
pay $115 million to the government and to plead guilty to four
counts of defrauding the Defense Department by overbilling on
aircraft parts.
   At the same time, its Sundstrand Data Control subsidiary settled
a separate case by agreeing to pay $13 million. That case involved
charges the company had used unallowable costs to inflate its
overhead rates.
   The U.S. attorney in Chicago, Anton Valukas, said a federal
investigation had determined that besides overbilling for aircraft
parts, the company had been submitting claims for such things as
babysitting expenses, country clubs and servants for its executives.
   The company also was attempting ``to improve (its) ability to
market hardware to the Defense Department by giving gratuities to
Defense Department personnel and their spouses while concealing
(their) identity,'' the government said.
   The Defense Department accounts for 42 percent of Sundstrand's
$1.4 billion in annual sales.
   Wilson said Thursday the Pentagon was now willing to lift the
suspension because the company ``has implemented a comprehensive
employee ethics program, taken meaningful disciplinary action
against the employees involved and made full restitution.''

<TEXT>
   The new secretary of state, James A. Baker III,
spent his first day at work Thursday settling into his 7th floor
suite _ and deciding to close the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan.
   Baker, one of President Bush's closest friends and the man who
managed the final months of Bush's campaign for the White House,
kept a low profile during his first working day and issued no
schedule.
   Within hours of being sworn in Wednesday night, however, the
rising turmoil in the Afghan capital required his attention.
   A U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Baker had
decided that the U.S. contingent, reduced to less than 10 officers
and security guards in recent weeks, would be pulled out over the
next several days.
   The move came as the Soviets continued to pull out troops that
have been in the country since 1979 and as fighting increased
between the pro-Moscow government and U.S.-backed rebels battling
for control of the country.
   The official added that the decision had been put off by Reagan
administration officials and left for Baker to deal with after he
was sworn in, which took place shortly after the Senate confirmed
his nomination.
   Asked about Baker's day, department spokesman Charles Redman
would say only that his new boss was ``getting established, that's
his first priority'' and that Baker had ``met with his top people.''
   Asked by a reporter to identify those individuals _ so that clues
might be drawn about who might in line for the top slots in the
department during the new administration's overhaul of personnel _
Redman smiled and declined to reveal Baker's appointments, evoking a
round of laughter from journalists.
   Redman also said he had no information about any foreign contacts
that Baker planned to have and said the new secretary looked toward
Monday as being his day to ``get ... into operation.''
   True to the former treasury secretary's crisp and formal style,
Baker held early-morning meetings with top aides in his formal
office workspace _ attired in suit and tie, said one senior official
who met with him.
   Baker's predecessor, George Shultz, had been known to strike an
informal note, meeting with aides in his more cozy sitting room,
doffing his suit coat for a sweater and poking intermittedly at the
embers in his fireplace.
   Baker was sworn in in a private ceremony at the street-floor
transition office he'd been using since his nomination. A more
formal oath-taking ceremony was set Friday afternoon in the elegant
East Room of the White House.

<HEAD>Court Rules Head Of Banco Ambrosiano Was Murdered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A civil court has ruled that Roberto Calvi, the
central figure in a banking scandal that reached into the Vatican,
was murdered in 1982 and did not commit suicide, news reports said
Thursday.
   Calvi's body was found hanging from a London bridge days after he
disappeared from Italy, where he was under investigation for his
inability to account for $1.4 billion in loans and interest on the
books of the bank he headed, Banco Ambrosiano.
   A coroner's jury in London in June 1983 left open the question of
whether Calvi hanged himself, or whether he was murdered to stop him
from revealing details about the financial scandal.
   Calvi was called ``God's banker'' for his close relations with
the Vatican.
   The Milan civil court suit was filed by Calvi's widow, Clara, who
wanted to collect on the banker's $3 million life insurance policy
issued by Assicurazioni Generali, Italy's largest insurance company.
   ``I am very satisfied by the sentence of the Milan civil court
which has recognized the death of my husband as an assassination and
not a suicide,'' Mrs. Calvi was quoted as saying by the Italian news
agency ANSA.
   A spokesman for Assicurazioni Generali, Armando Zimolo, confirmed
that the policy prohibited payment in the case of suicide. He said
the company had held off paying until the cause of death was
established.
   Wednesday's verdict did not mean the Calvi family would collect
on the policy. The Calvi case has yet to go before a criminal court,
and the Milan tribunal's decision could be overturned on appeal to a
higher civil court.
   The Turin-based newspaper La Stampa said the Milan court ruled on
the basis of the autopsy and a reconstruction of what the court
believed happened on the night of June 17, 1982, at Blackfriers
Bridge in London.
   Calvi was found dangling from scaffolding under the bridge, with
11 pounds of bricks stuffed into his pockets and another brick
jammed down the front of his pants.
   Banco Ambrosiano collapsed following its failure to collect $1.4
billion in loans made to 10 dummy companies in Latin America
controlled by the Vatican bank.

   Afghanistan has invited Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar to visit Kabul and explore ways of avoiding
a bloodbath after all Soviet soldiers have left the country, U.N.
sources said Thursday.
   Under a U.N.-mediated agreement, the Red Army is to be gone by
Feb. 15, leaving Afghanistan's conscript army to continue the
11-year-old war with Moslem guerrillas.
   The official sources said privately that President Najib extended
the invitation recently and it was under consideration.
   No details were available, but the sources said Perez de Cuellar
might witness the final Soviet withdrawal Feb. 15.
   Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979, and the
last of an estimated 115,000 are to be out by Feb. 15.
   About 70 U.N. monitors are observing the withdrawal, which began
May 15 of last year. No plans have been made for a peacekeeping
force to prevent violence afterward.
   Official spokesman Francois Giuliani said Diego Cordovez, the
secretary-general's special representative for Afghanistan, was
expected to visit Kabul before the deadline.
   Cordovez has been urging Afghan factions to reach a political
settlement. The guerrillas have rejected proposals by the Soviets
and Najib's government.
   Increased attacks by the insurgents, who are supported by the
United States and Pakistan, have made it difficult for supply
convoys to reach Kabul, creating a severe food and fuel shortage.
   A Soviet airlift has carried hundreds of tons of flour and fuel
to the capital since lass Saturday.
   Many observers have predicted a bloodbath after the Soviet
departure. The guerrillas, who control the countryside, claim
Najib's regime will fall quickly.
   The United States said Thursday its Kabul embassy would be closed
over the next several days. The American staff already had been
reduced to fewer than 10 officers and security guards.
   U.N. aid officials in Kabul have said more food and fuel is
needed if disaster is to be averted.
   Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, U.N. coordinator for relief and
rehabilitation, met in Geneva on Wednesday with representatives of
the World Health Organization, U.N. Development Program and UNICEF,
the U.N. Children's Fund.
   ``All came to the conclusion that the United Nations must be
present in the whole of the country, including Kabul,'' particularly
to help women and children, Giuliani told reporters at his daily
briefing.
   Negotiations with guerrillas also have been reported in an
attempt to arrange for movement of relief convoys.

<TEXT>
   A Scottish immigrant who became a
decorated Vietnam soldier and then a troubled veteran with a string
of arrests told a deportation judge Thursday that he can't explain
``the crazy stuff'' he's done.
   Hearings ended Thursday on whether Fred S. Jackson, 40, a
resident alien in this country for more than 20 years, should be
deported. Immigration Judge Billino W. D'Ambrosio said he would rule
on the case within 60 days.
   Jackson, facing deportation because of 26 felony convictions
since he got out of the Army in 1970, is arguing that he should be
allowed to stay in the United States because of his military record.
   Resident aliens who have been convicted of at least two crimes
involving ``moral turpitude'' are subject to deportation.
   He blames his crimes on the post-traumatic stress syndrome, a
condition found in some Vietnam veterans and victims of violent
crimes.
   Jackson says flashbacks of terrifying ambushes and firefights led
him to abuse drugs and alcohol.
   During the hearing Thursday, Sean Keenan, a U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service attorney, questioned Jackson about his
criminal record, especially the six convictions since deportation
proceedings began in 1978. Jackson conceded that those offenses
might strengthen the case against him.
   ``I can't explain any of the crazy stuff I've done,'' said
Jackson, who was seriously wounded twice in Vietnam and awarded two
Purple Hearts and the Bronze star.
   ``If I knew what I was doing, I wouldn't have done it,'' he said.
   Immigration officials have continually refused to discuss the
case in detail or their reasoning for seeking deportation, saying
laws prevent them from doing so.
   Jackson was treated at the post-traumatic stress unit at the
Veterans Administration Medical Center in Northampton, Mass., last
summer. He said he hasn't used drugs or alcohol in more than six
months.
   The immigration service began deportation proceedings against
Jackson in 1978 after a string of convictions for burglary, larceny
and drug possession.
   In 1980, Jackson was convicted of armed robbery charges in
Florida. The government renewed efforts to deport Jackson after his
release from prison in 1985.
   Jackson's legal representative, Robert D. Money of the
International Institute, said his recent problems, including an
arrest for drunken driving in April 1988, don't necessarily ruin his
chances to remain in the United States.
   ``It isn't a serious blow, because in Fred's case, he has an
illness,'' Money said. ``He's going all-out to cooperate with the
doctors.''
   Jackson, who retains a slight Scottish brogue, enlisted in 1967
at age 18, two years after his family emigrated to Norwich, an
industrial city about 30 miles southwest of Hartford. He went to
Vietnam in January 1968 as an infantryman with the 1st Air Cavalry
Division.
   He now lives in public housing in Norwich with his wife,
Charlene, her 6-year-old son and their infant daughter. The family
lives on disability payments from the Army, and from Social
Security, which has declared him 100 percent disabled.

   The army displayed its ``volunteers''
Thursday _ solemn teen-agers and men in their late 30s _ in answer
to charges of dragging young men from their homes to fight
guerrillas as Soviet soldiers withdraw.
   ``They are all volunteers. We've had 266 coming here in the past
three days,'' said Col. Abdul Ghani, who commands one of nine
training centers on the capital's outskirts.
   ``There may be some places where there are people who had to
join, but here they all came because they want to defend the
country,'' he told Western reporters visiting the center.
   Afghanistan's conscript army desperately needs recruits now that
the Kremlin is giving up on a military commitment that lasted almost
a decade.
   Two years of army service is compulsory, but thousands of Afghans
have deserted during 11 years of war with Moslem guerrillas. Many
more young men have fled the country either to avoid conscription or
to join the insurgents.
   Western diplomats estimate most Afghan battalions are one-third
under strength, and say they have reports of young men being taken
away by force.
   One said scores were taken last week during house-to-house
searches in Kabul's Shash Darak district, flown to Kandahar in the
south and given uniforms. The city is ringed by guerrillas, who
control the Afghan countryside.
   Diplomats report similar raids in the other parts of the city.
   Guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978.
Soviet soldiers arrived in December 1979 and reached an estimated
strength of 115,000 by the time a U.N.-mediated withdrawan agreement
was signed last April.
   They began pulling out May 15. Half had left by Aug. 15 and the
rest are to be gone by Feb. 15, leaving the Afghan army with a
last-ditch battle to save the Soviet-sponsored government.
   The insurgents were not parties to the withdrawal agreement and
have rejected Soviet and Afghan government proposals for a political
solution.
   Western diplomats in Pakistan reported Thursday that Soviet
troops and Afghan government forces killed hundreds of people and
wiped out villages during an attack Monday on the Salang Highway
about 60 miles north of Kabul.
   Also Thursday, Secretary of State James A. Baker ordered the
closing of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, a U.S. official in Washington
said.
   Many Afghans acknowledge privately that their sons support the
guerrillas or have left the country to avoid military service.
   String-pulling appears to be more difficult as the final Soviet
departure nears. An Afghan secretary at a U.N. agency, a diplomat's
daughter, said the military had ``taken'' her 17-year-old brother,
and her father was not allowed to take his family along to a foreign
post.
   The government of President Najib says it has 500,000 men under
arms or in paramilitary units. According to Western estimates,
however, the army totals 35,000-40,000 men, the Khad secret police
35,000 and the Tsarandoy force of the Interior Ministry 35,000.
   At the training center display of ``volunteers,'' Mohammad
Shawali, a 39-year-old former teacher with his hair cut short, sat
beside a semi-literate 18-year-old, Mohammad Akhram, in a class on
basic arms instruction.
   Speaking through a government interpeter before the colonel and
the rest of the class, Shawali said had been exempt from military
service as a teacher but decided to join up ``becaue ... we must
defend our country. Perhaps at my age it will encourage others to
join.''
   Akhram said: ``Until I no longer have blood, I will fight for the
protection of my country.''
   Ghani said the 1,000 recruits at his center will get three to six
months of training before going out to fight guerrillas.
   He acknowledged the volunteers would not be permitted to change
their minds, and said: ``Well, why should they after coming here?''
   Recruits armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles and wearing bulky
overcoats went through their places at a firing range, flinging
themselves down in the mud and snow.
   The colonel said mine-detection training is conducted with
U.S.-made mines captured from the guerrillas, who get most of their
arms from the United States and neighboring Pakistan.
   Soviet influence was everywhere in the camp, from the concrete
three-story military barracks to Red Army maps.
   In the middle of the camp, an obelisk supported a caricature of
Uncle Sam atop a globe with an American bald eagle perched on his
head. The slogan read: ``Imperialism of the United States is the
enemy of liberty, of democracy, of the people.''

<HEAD>US, North Koreans Diplomats Meet in Beijing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American and North Korean diplomats have held two
meetings in Beijing, apparently the first in at least a year,
according to reports Thursday in China and in Washington.
   Sin In Ha, the North Korean ambassador, told a news conference in
the Chinese capital the talks ``were not anything to shout about.''
   ``It was very simple,'' he said. ``Living together on the same
planet it is impossible not to have contact. ... We always keep the
door open for talks but the United States closes the door.''
   Neither he nor the U.S. State Department would reveal details.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman gave the
meeting dates as Dec. 6 and last Tuesday.
   ``We believe that these contacts have been useful,'' he said.
``Both sides stated their positions on Korean peninsula political
and security issues.''
   Redman said the meetings between the political counselors of the
two embassies were arranged through the ``good offices'' of China,
an ally of communist North Korea.
   He said North Korea delivered a letter from Foreign Minister Kim
Yon-Nam to George P. Shultz, then secretary of state, at the
December meeting and the United States responded at this week's
session.
   The meetings were believed to be the first since Washington
relaxed rules last fall on contacts between the two countries, which
do not have diplomatic relations.
   In January 1988, the State Department declared North Korea a
terrorist nation and barred ``substantive discussions'' with North
Korean envoys in third countries. The action responded to the
bombing of a South Korean jetliner in November 1987 by a woman who
said she was a North Korean agent.
   When the 1988 Seoul Olympics concluded in October without
disruption by North Korea, the United States again authorized such
contacts.

   A new tremor shook the Central Asian
republic of Tadzhikistan on Thursday near villages where a
quake-triggered mudslide killed hundreds this week. No casualties or
damage were reported.
   The official Tass news agency said the tremor struck without
incident at 2 a.m. about 15 miles southwest of the republic's
capital, Dushanbe.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., Russ
Needham, said the quake _ ``quite probably an aftershock'' _ was not
large enough to register on American monitoring equipment.
   The epicenter of Thursday's tremor was 18 miles southwest of
Sharora, which was smothered by a mudslide after the quake early
Monday that measured 5.4 on the Richter scale.
   The slide buried one-story mud-brick and prefabricated concrete
homes in three remote mountain villages and killed 274 people,
officials said.

<HEAD>Leaders Of Jewish Group Repressed Under Stalin Rehabilitated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party on Thursday announced the
rehabilitation of 10 leaders of a Jewish group that spread Soviet
propaganda abroad during World War II but was later broken up in
Josef V. Stalin's reign of terror.
   A commission of the party's ruling Politburo, which has been
announcing rehabilitations of the Soviet dictator's victims since
last year, made the announcement about the Jewish Anti-Fascist
Committee, the official Tass news agency said.
   The panel said the Supreme Court threw out the sentences of the
committee's leaders in 1955, three years after they were imprisoned
or executed. But it said the exoneration of the leaders was not
publicized at the time.
   Stalin's successor as Soviet leader, Nikita S. Khrushchev, began
rehabilitating victims in the 1950s, but the process was cut short
with his ouster in 1964. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev resumed the
process in his campaign for reforms.
   During the war, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee worked to rally
Soviet and world public opinion against fascist atrocities.
   After the war, its leader, the famed Soviet Jewish actor Solomon
Mikhoels, traveled to the United States to raise money for the
devastated Jewish community in the Soviet Union. Stalin considered
these acts treason and espionage.
   In 1948, the committee was dissolved and its leaders arrested on
espionage and other charges that Tass said Thursday were
``groundless.''
   Mikhoels was killed in 1948 in what Soviet authorities described
at the time as a traffic accident, but it is believed to have been
an officially sponsored assassination.
   Four years later, he was accused of being a key figure in the
Doctors' Plot, an alleged scheme in which Kremlin doctors _ mostly
Jews _ were accused of trying to kill Soviet leaders. After Stalin's
death, the doctors and Mikhoels were rehabilitated.
   The Politburo commission said Solomon Lozovsky, a former
assistant foreign minister of Jewish origin, was among eight
committee leaders legally and politically cleared in an unpublicized
action in 1955.
   Two other committee members, B.A. Shimeliovich and D.N.
Gofshtein, have just been restored to the Communist Party, Tass said.

   Authorities on Thursday identified two
more West German companies that may have helped build an alleged
chemical weapons plant in Libya.
   Hubertus Voegele, a spokesman for the Offenburg prosecutor's
office, said the companies are the Pen-Tsao shipping company of
Hamburg and an Imhausen-Chemie subsidiary, the GFA company in Bochum.
   The two were among the companies whose records were seized in a
widening probe of West German involvement in the construction of the
plant. Investigators said they began evaluating the documents last
week.
   ``The process will take a long time,'' said Voegele.
   Customs authorities on Wednesday searched the offices of the two
companies, a third company and the homes of 12 individuals on
suspicion that export laws had been violated.
   The third company searched was Imhausen-Chemie, which is
suspected of playing a major role in building the plant in Rabta, 60
miles south of the Libyan capital of Tripoli.
   U.S. officials claim the plant in Rabta is intended to produce
poison gas. Libya says it is a pharmaceutical factory.
   West Germany's Chemical Industry Association suspended
Imhausen-Chemie's membership pending the outcome of the
investigation. Association President Helmut Sihler said the
company's membership had been suspended ``until the company had been
cleared of allegations'' in the Libyan case. He said it was the
first time the association had taken such action against a member
company.
   The current investigations are focusing on a West German law that
requires an export license to ships arms, hazardous substances or
components that can be used to produce them.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Cancels Meetings In Indonesia, Paris and Bangkok</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, once Cambodia's ruler and
now a rebel leader, said Thursday he will not attend peace talks
next month because the Vietnamese-sponsored government of his
homeland rejected his proposals.
   Sihanouk, who heads a coalition fighting Vietnam's decade-long
occupation of Cambodia, said in a statement that ``it is absolutely
useless for me to be in Jakarta,'' capital of Indonesia, for the
negotiations.
   He also said he would not go to Paris in the spring for a meeting
of the three rebel factions and the Cambodian government, and had
called off a meeting in Bangkok with Siddhi Savetsila, foreign
minister of Thailand, scheduled for the end of February.
   Representatives of Vietnam, Laos, the warring parties of Cambodia
and the non-communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations are to
meet Feb. 19-22 in Jakarta for a second session of peace talks. The
first was held last July.
   Members of ASEAN are Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia,
the Philippines and Brunei.
   Sihanouk arrived in Beijing on Tuesday and had said the next day
he would go to Jakarta but not participate in the meetings.
   His five-point plan proposes that international peacekeeping
force supervise Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia, which it invaded
in December 1978 and has occupied since.
   Hun Sen, premier of the government Vietnam installed in Phnom
Penh, claims the plan would facilitate the return to power in
Cambodia of the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three resistance
groups.
   The Khmer Rouge led Cambodia from the end of the Indochina war in
1975 until the Vietnamese invasion and was responsible for at least
1 million deaths.
   China's army attacked Vietnam in 1979 to ``punish'' it for
invading Cambodia invasion, but last week the two countries held
their first high-level meeting in a decade.
   Vietnam agreed in principle to withdraw from Cambodia by
September if a political settlement is reached. It also agreed to
supervision by an international group, whose makeup has not been
determined.
   China said it would slow aid to the rebel coalition in tandem
with the Vietnamese departure.
   The agreement in principle does not represent a change in
position by either country.
   Sihanouk said Tuesday he opposed linking ``an end to material aid
to the resistance and the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops'' and was
pessimistic about easy solutions.
   Progress had been made on solving the international aspects of
the conflict, he said, but a ``deadlock'' remained on the
composition of a future Cambodian government.
   In Bangkok, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan urged all
factions to attend the Jakarta negotiations.
   ``The Cambodian parties must face one another,'' he told
reporters after two days of talks with Hun Sen. ``It's pointless for
them to fight and kill one another.''

   An Arizona fugitive and his companion
were charged Thursday in the abduction-slaying of a man shot to
death after the his wife paid a $25,000 ransom.
   John Martini, 58, and Therese Afdahl, 30, were arrested after
being spotted by police at a Fort Lee motel Wednesday and were
charged in the slaying of 58-year-old Irving Flax.
   Flax's body was found Tuesday morning with three gunshot wounds
to the head in a shopping mall parking lot in Paramus. An autopsy
showed he apparently had been shot about four hours after his wife
dropped off the ransom Monday night.
   FBI agents trailing the kidnapper who picked up the ransom in
Flax's car lost track of the auto about 45 minutes later in New York
City.
   ``There was a lot of evasive driving before we lost him,'' said
John C. McGinley, the FBI agent in charge of the bureau's Newark
office. ``It looked as though he was looking for any signs of our
surveillance.''
   Acting Bergen County Prosecutor John Holl said the investigation
continued.
   ``It's possible there may be more arrests,'' he said.
   Superior Court Judge Charles R. DiGisi ordered Martini held
without bail because he is also wanted on a Glendale, Ariz., murder
warrant in which two people were found dead in a mall parking lot,
authorities said.
   Ms. Afdahl was ordered held on $500,000 cash bail.
   Both face murder and weapon possession charges in New Jersey. The
court entered innocent pleas for the two until they can consult with
attorneys.
   In Arizona, Glendale police said a warrant issued Nov. 29
accusing Martini of shooting to death Teresa Marie Dempster, 27, and
David Richard Uhl, 42, whose bodies were found Nov. 8 in a car
parked at a small shopping center.
   Holl said Martini knew Flax when the two worked as drivers for
the Miller Trucking Co. two decades ago. Martini turned up on Flax's
doorstep Monday morning and invited him to go for coffee, the
prosecutor said.
   Holl said Flax was taken at gunpoint to an apartment in Fairview
that Martini and Ms. Afdahl had rented. Calls were then made to
Flax's wife, telling her to bring the $25,000 to a diner that
evening.
   At the diner Martini motioned for her drop the brown bag
containing the ransom, picked it up and fled in Flax's car, Holl
said. After losing the FBI agents, he returned to the Fairview
apartment and took Flax to the shopping mall where he was shot about
11:30 p.m., Holl said.
   The prosecutor said the couple were caught Wednesday night after
an anonymous tipster alerted Bergen County authorities that Martini
was in New Jersey.
   When arrested the two were carrying a duffel bag containing
$29,000 and a .32 caliber handgun. The serial numbers on $25,000 of
the cash matched the numbers of the bills used in the ransom,
authorities said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, on his
first day on the job, decided Thursday to close the U.S. Embassy in
Kabul amid rising turmoil during a Soviet troop withdrawal, a U.S.
official said.
   The U.S. diplomatic contingent in Kabul had already been reduced
to less than 10 officers and security guards. Their situation is
considered precarious in light of a bitter civil war between the
pro-Moscow government and U.S.-armed rebels.
   The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
pullout would be carried out over several days.
   All 50,000 Soviet troops in the war-torn country are supposed to
leave by Feb. 15 under the Geneva accords signed last April.
   Their departure is expected to remove a stabilizing influence on
the Kabul government. The guerrillas, meanwhile, are likely to
redouble their offensive against government forces no longer backed
by the Red Army.
   Apart from the small diplomatic contingent, there are fewer than
20 private U.S. citizens in Afghanistan. They have been encouraged
to leave, and the State Department has urged Americans not to travel
to the country.
   On Wednesday, the mayor of Kabul said the capital had a
three-month supply of food and fuel in case of a guerrilla siege.
Soviet soldiers handed out emergency rations. Soviet cargo planes
began flying loads of flour and fuel to Kabul on Saturday.
   The Reagan administration, in its final days, pondered whether to
abandon the embassy or to leave the decision to its successors. The
U.S. official, said it was left up to Baker and he decided to close
the embassy on his first day of the job.
   Earlier, Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said
there were reports from Kabul that Soviet and Afghan forces had
obliterated with artillery attacks all of the dwellings in a number
of villages south of the Salang Tunnel, through which Soviet troops
are departing the country.
   ``There are eyewitnesses who say no dwellings remain and hundreds
of civilians were killed,'' Redman said.
   He said no U.S. Embassy personnel were in the devastated area.
   Baker's order came almost 10 years after a U.S. ambassador to
Afghanistan, Adolph Dubs, was shot and killed after he was kidnapped
by Moslem extremists.
   Dubs was seized Feb. 14, 1979, as he was being driven to the
embassy. His kidnappers demanded the release of Moslem religious
figures and Dubs was killed in an exchange of gunfire which occurred
when Afghan government security stormed the hotel where he was being
held.
   Other than those in embassies, most Westerners are with the
International Aid Mission, a charitable organization that has
operated in Afghanistan for many years. Among other things, it runs
an eye hospital in Kabul.
   Britain's embassy in Kabul issued warnings last week to to its
nationals and citizens of other countries for which it has
diplomatic responsibility, including Canada, Australia and Ireland.
   Other than the missionaries, foreigners still in Afghanistan
include a few hundred diplomats, a dwindling number of Soviet
civilian advisers, employees of the International Red Cross and
officials of U.N. aid agencies and the U.N. body monitoring the
withdrawal agreement.
   On Saturday, the West German Embassy became the first to close.
Spokesmen for others say they confer regularly about when or whether
to do the same.

   Maoist rebels forced a judge and seven
village leaders to lie down in the town square, shot them to death
and ordered their bodies left untouched, police said Thursday.
   Justice of the Peace Honorato Salazar and the village leaders
were slain Sunday in Vilca, a tiny Andean hamlet 40 miles west of
Huancayo, police said.
   Ten Shining Path rebels disguised in army uniforms and
brandishing machine guns and rifles disrupted a celebration in the
square and ordered the eight to lie on the ground.
   The insurgents accused the men of supporting Peru's elected
government, and shot them to death, police said.
   They said rebels remained in Vilca for two days, threatening
violence for anyone touching the bodies. They said the rebels
ordered the bodies left untouched as ``food for the dogs.''
   Police said villagers late Wednesday carried the bodies to
Huancayo, 125 miles east of Lima, and informed officials of the
attack.
   The Shining Path stepped up its attacks across rural Peru late
last year, killing hundreds of peasants, police, soldiers and other
officials.
   The government says violence surrounding the rebels' nine-year
insurgency has claimed more than 12,000 lives.

<HEAD>Company President Acknowledges Infiltrating Animal Rights Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surgical supply company president who was
the target of a bombing attempt by an animal-rights activist
acknowledged Thursday that his company has used paid informants to
infiltrate animal-rights groups.
   ``If we didn't have somebody in the animal rights group that
believed in right and wrong, you and I would not be having this
conversation _ I'd be dead,'' said Leon C. Hirsch, president and
founder of U.S. Surgical Corp.
   Fran Trutt was arrested Nov. 11 in Norwalk after police said she
placed a radio-controlled pipe bomb packed with roofing nails on the
grounds of U.S. Surgical. They said she apparently opposed the
company's use of live, anesthetized dogs in surgical equipment
demonstrations.
   Meanwhile, CBS News obtained a tape-recorded conversation of a
woman it identified as Trutt telling an informant that she ``knew
what had to be done'' and planned to ``go for Leon,'' an apparent
reference to Hirsch.
   Hirsch, in a telephone interview Thursday with The Associated
Press, asserted that ``terrorists'' within the animal-rights
movement have left U.S. Surgical and other medical companies little
choice but to wage a sort of counter-offensive to protect themselves.
   ``Many of them are very dangerous organizations,'' he said.
``They don't believe in right and wrong as most people in society
do. They believe that human beings are on the same par as rats and
dogs and they are prepared to take violent actions to enforce their
beliefs.
   Hirsch dismissed suggestions that Trutt, 33, of New York City had
been entrapped, saying that neither his company, the Norwalk police
nor his security consultant, Perceptions International Inc. of
Stratford, had aided or coerced Trutt into planting the bomb.
   ``There was absolutely not a shimmer of entrapment involved
here,'' he said. ``That woman attempted to kill me. It was her idea
... it was her orchestration.''
   The Westport News reported earlier this month that U.S. Surgical,
through Perceptions International, had recruited Marc Mead of
Westport to strike up a friendship with Trutt and to inform U.S.
Surgical of her activities.
   The authorities have said Mead, 30, helped transport the bomb to
U.S. Surgical's parking lot and was with Trutt when she was arrested
that same day. Mead has not been charged in the case.
   Mead's attorney, Kenneth D'Amato, said he wouldn't discuss the
case.
   Trutt is being held under $500,000 bond and is scheduled to
appear in Stamford Superior Court for a pretrial hearing Feb. 2.
   On the tape-recording obtained by CBS, the woman the network
identified as Trutt said: ``Then I'm going to do what has to be done
... I'm going to go for Leon. I'm going to learn to make a bomb if I
have to make it myself.''
   In an on-camera interview with CBS, Trutt reiterated previous
statements that she only meant to frighten Hirsch.
   Trutt said an informant gave her the money for the bomb, but said
she wasn't coerced into planting it.

   Defense Secretary-designate John Tower told a
Senate confirmation hearing Thursday that the more than $1 million
he made as a consultant for major defense contractors would not
influence his decisions at the Pentagon.
   Tower, on the second day of hearings before the Armed Services
Committee, said Congress should tighten ``revolving-door'' laws to
prevent officials ``from profiting unfairly, unethically or
illegally or inordinately'' if they move between Pentagon and
industry jobs.
   But he cautioned Congress that it should write such laws
``carefully enough so that honest, hardworking people who might want
to engage in public service are not summarily proscribed'' from
working at the Pentagon.
   In addition to personal and ethics questions, Tower was asked
about specific weapons programs such as Star Wars, the MX and
Midgetman missiles, the 600-ship Navy and Special Operations Forces.
   Tower voiced skepticism about the prospects for the Strategic
Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. Former President
Reagan launched the program five years ago and said it should be
aimed at building a ballistic missile defense (BMD) that would
protect Americans from Soviet nuclear attack.
   ``To begin with, I don't believe that we can devise a BMD
umbrella that can protect the entire American population from
nuclear incineration. I think that's unrealistic,'' Tower said in
answer to questions from Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn.
   Tower cautioned that ``I don't want to get out in front'' of
President Bush's SDI statements. Bush said during last fall's
campaign that he favored deployment of a limited SDI system as soon
as possible.
   Tower explained that SDI was part of an effort to move nuclear
strategy from an offensive to a defensive focus. But he cautioned
``it remains to be seen whether that is a realistic objective.''
   Gore noted Tower's pessimism about SDI prospects ``represents a
view markedly different from the public's perception of President
Reagan's advocacy of a perfect defensive umbrella.
   ``Nothing is sacred'' as the Bush administration struggles to cut
the federal budget deficit, Tower said, but he declined to say what
recommendations he would make and said decisions on specific issues
must await a strategic review ordered by the president.
   Asked when decisions would be made, he said, ``It's got to be
soon.''
   President Bush has said he would send Congress a revised version
of the Pentagon budget that President Reagan submitted. Reagan
proposed a 2 percent growth in defense spending after inflation.
Bush aides and senior members of Congress have said holding the
increase to the inflation rate expected by the administration _ a
bit under 4 percent _ was more realistic.
   During the afternoon session devoted to defense policy, Tower
acknowledged the Soviet Union's military superiority, saying, ``At
this moment, they have the capability to prevail in an invasion of
western Europe.''
   Tower was also pressed on the defense budget as Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., asked if the need for a strong defense would require an
increase in taxes.
   ``I read the president's lips,'' Tower said referring to Bush's
campaign claim. ``I disagree with them at my peril.''
   The session Thursday opened with a lengthy review of Tower's
dealings with defense contractors after 1985, when he ended a
24-year Senate career that included a stint from 1981-84 as chairman
of the Armed Services Committee.
   According to Tower's earlier testimony, he received $763,777 in
fees from the defense contractors over a three-year period. He later
adjusted that total to $1,028,777 to include the $265,000 paid by
British Aerospace.
   Tower testified that he terminated all financial ties and
contracts with defense companies on Dec. 1 last year, one day after
learning from Bush's transition staff that he was under serious
consideration for the defense post. He said he did not ``stand to
gain from the prosperity of any former associate.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
said he was concerned about Tower's former ties with those defense
contractors.
   ``Frankly, the difficulty here is not that you have worked for a
contractor as a consultant, but a number of them, five or six or
seven of the major corporations,'' Nunn said. ``If you were to
recuse (not involve) yourself on all of them, you couldn't be
secretary of defense.''
   Tower said, ``The likelihood is I will bend over backwards'' to
avoid favoring his former associates.
   ``Your former clients might worry,'' Nunn said.
   ``That may be true,'' Tower responded.
   Nunn told Tower that ``I know you and I know you are an honest
person.''
   Tower told committee members he had never engaged in the types of
activities described in the ``Ill Wind'' investigations of
consultants who are accused of selling contractors inside
information on Pentagon procurement deals.
   Under persistent questioning from Levin, Tower said he would
recuse himself from making decisions on the CFIN system, the combat
flight inspection system which allows airborne aircraft to check on
whether landing transmitters are working correctly, because of the
extensive lobbying he did for the program on behalf of the LTV Corp.
   But he refused to specify other systems he would recuse himself
from, saying he would handle those on an ``ad hoc'' basis.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., asked Tower whether tougher ethics laws
were needed for people who transfer between jobs at the Pentagon and
industry.
   Tower said that ``in light of what has happened'' in the
procurement cases legislation was needed to ``reduce the likelihood
if not foreclose anyone who had been in the Defense Department from
profiting unfairly, unethically, or illegally or inordinately'' in
an industry job.
   Still, Tower noted that Donald J. Atwood, whom he has chosen as
deputy defense secretary, has been vice chairman of the General
Motors Corp., a major Pentagon contractor. He said other top aides
would be drawn from the defense industry as well.

<HEAD>Examiner's Verdict In Trash Can Death: Man Died of Heart Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 73-year-old man, apparently stuck in a
trash can on his front porch since Monday, waved to visitors who
``let it pass'' and eventually died of a heart attack, authorities
said Thursday.
   Robert Hamm was wedged up to his armpits, his lower legs sticking
out of the standard, galvanized trash can when he was found
Wednesday by the mother of a newspaper carrier, who first saw the
old man sitting in the can Monday.
   ``It was a natural death, something that could have happened any
time,'' said a Monroe County medical examiner's spokesman, who said
it was policy not to identify himself. ``It could have happened
while he was sleeping in bed.''
   Hamm, who lived alone, waved to the newspaper carrier and to a
mail carrier while in the can earlier this week, but may have been
too weak to alert them that he was stuck, police said. They refused
to identify the carriers.
   ``I would imagine he was probably trying to signal something, but
his expression or whatever wasn't enough to get them to do anything
about it,'' said Sgt. R.J. Liepins. ``They all feel very bad.''
   Liepins said it appeared that Hamm, described as being of medium
height and build, had fallen backward into the can on his enclosed
front porch and couldn't get out.
   Police said Thursday they did not suspect foul play in the death
and had no way of verifying whether he actually was stuck on the
porch three days. Hamm's house was apparently intact and its
contents undisturbed, officers said.
   The 11-year-old newspaper carrier told police she waved at Hamm
and said hello from outside the porch while delivering the newspaper
about 4 p.m. Monday. She said he waved back and mumbled something,
police said.
   On Tuesday, the mail carrier, whose name was unavailable, also
saw him in the can from outside the porch and saw his hand move,
Liepins said. ``He thought something was funny ... but he just let
it pass,'' Liepins said.
   The newspaper carrier told her mother on Monday and again on
Tuesday, but the woman didn't go to Hamm's house until Wednesday
because she didn't think anything was seriously wrong.
   ``He was kind of eccentric and we didn't think anything about
it,'' police quoted her as saying.

   Europe's Ariane 2 rocket lifted off
Thursday night and put the international communications satellite
Intelsat V-F15 into orbit.
   The rocket left the European Space Agency launch pad on the
Atlantic coast of South America 10:21 p.m. after a 53-minute delay
caused by an indicator light mistakenly suggesting a malfunctioning
valve on a hydrogen reservoir, Arianespace officials said.
   The faulty indicator automatically halted the countdown 18
seconds before the scheduled liftoff. But technicians were able to
determine quickly that the valve was working properly, allowing the
launch to proceed.
   About 35 minutes after the launch, Arianespace officials
announced that the satellite was in orbit and declared the mission a
success. In the coming days, the orbit will be adjusted to station
the Intersat V-F15 over the Indian Ocean.
   The 4,400-pound satellite, with 36 transponders to carry
television and telephone communications, is to join 13 others
operated by Intelsat. The International Telecommunications Satellite
Organization is a non-profit cooperative of 115 countries.
   The Intelsat network carries more than half of all international
telephone calls and nearly all transoceanic television transmissions.
   The launch is the first of the year for Arianespace, a consortium
of 50 European companies responsible for the commercial exploitation
of the Ariane series of rockets developed by the European Space
Agency.
   In seven launches last year, all successful, Arianespace put 13
satellites in orbit last year for various clients.

<HEAD>Gadhafi Calls Bush Practical And Says He Wants Dialogue With U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, calling President
Bush a factual and practical man, says he wants to establish a
direct dialogue with the Bush administration, ABC News reports.
   In an interview that will be aired on the network's ``20-20''
news program Friday night, Gadhafi also said Libya's ``official
position is that we are against terrorism.''
   The United States has said that in order for the two countries to
establish a dialogue, Libya must renounce international terrorism.
   The Libyan leader was interviewed on Monday by correspondent
Barbara Walters in his tent in his Tripoli compound.
   Gadhafi, asked his opinion of President Bush, said, ``I know he's
a man who's completely different from (former President) Reagan.
He's a politician, a factual man, a practical...''
   ``Reagan used to treat the presidency as a theater where he
performs his acts,'' he said through an interpreter.
   Gadhafi compared Abu Nidal, head of the Fatah-Revolutionary
Counsel, a hardline offshoot of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, with George Washington.
   ``Abu Nidal has a fair case. He's defending his people to
liberate his country from the occupation,'' he said.
   Asked if he supports Abu Nidal, Gadhafi said, ``No, this is not
the case.'' ``I am against Abu Nidal if he carries out his
operations against innocent civilians,'' he said.
   Asked about PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's position that an
independent Palestinian state could live peacefully next to Israel
and that Israel has a right to exist, Gadhafi said, ``We better wait
and see the consequences.''
   But then he said, ``It is impossible to establish two states
between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea.''
   Asked about his country's chemical plant at Rabta which the U.S.
government says was built to make poison gas, Ghadafi said, ``This
is a medicine plant.''
   He said the ``diplomatic corps, journalists'' would be invited to
the plant for its inauguration but he said neutral observers could
not make repeated visits to it after the opening.
   ``If this is going to be the case we ought to nominate an
international observing commission to inspect all factories and
plants in the world continuously periodically,'' he said.
   Asked about the U.S. air attack on Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986,
Ghadafi said, ``I was at home with my family. I tried to save them
quickly from the place. The other children were in bedrooms. The
little girl was killed.''
   He said the child was ``a little girl we adopted from the
orphanage house.''
   ``When she was killed she was about 15 months old. We have one
girl, so we decided to adopt this little girl because (our) other
children are boys,'' he said.

   A 125-acre plot of farmland once owned by
Abraham Lincoln and his father was sold at auction Thursday to a
farmer for $98,500.
   Ron Best, a Coles County farmer, beat two other bidders at a
foreclosure sale held in Mattoon. Best's purchase will be used to
retire a mortgage signed by Raymond W. Phipps of Springfield in
August 1975.
   The land is eight miles south of Charleston and will be used
``for farming and farming only,'' Best said.
   The land is near the Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site, and
several volunteers who work at the restored Lincoln Log Cabin showed
up in period costumes.
   Though the character of Thomas Lincoln, who actually farmed the
land, was represented, Abe Lincoln was not.

<HEAD>Six Dissidents Freed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six activists arrested during a wave of
unrest in Prague have been released, but they and other dissidents
still could face charges, sources and a government offical said
Thursday.
   Palach Press, an emigre publishing house in London, told The
Associated Press by phone that six activists were released Wednesday
evening but could face charges of disturbing public order and
hooliganism.
   Those charges carry a maximum sentence of one year and two years
in jail respectively.
   Three other activists remain jailed, including banned playwright
Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's most prominent dissident, government
spokesman Miroslav Pavel said Thursday.
   Asked at a news conference what charges Havel will face, Pavel
replied, ``Apparently also hooliganism.''
   The 52-year-old playwright, who was sentenced to four and a half
years in jail in 1979 at a subversion trial that provoked outrage in
the West, has been in custody since Jan. 16.
   Havel and 15 other activists were arrested after eight of them
tried to lay flowers on Prague's Wenceslas square in memory of
student Jan Palach, who set himself on fire.
   Palach's act on Jan. 16, 1969, was to protest the presence of
Soviet troops in his country, stationed there since the 1968
Soviet-led invasion that crushed the communist party reforms.
   Pavel told a news conference Thursday that 519 people were
arrested during the Prague unrest that began on Jan. 16 and lasted a
week. He said 130 were charged with misdemeanors and 79 with
hooliganism.
   Pavel confirmed that two activists _ Jana Petrova and Otakar
Veverka _ remained with Havel in custody Thursday and face charges
of hooliganism.
   In another development, Pentecostalists in the Czech republic
have been granted the right to legally practice their religion as of
Feb. 1, the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said Thursday.
   Frantisek Jelinek, a vice minister in charge of religious affairs
for the republic, was quoted as saying that the approval of the
Apostolic Church, based on the Pentecostalist movement, is a way to
express ``equality of all denominations and religous tolerance,'' in
Czechoslovakia.
   ``In the Czech Socialist republic, this will be a relatively
small church, with approximately 2,OOO believers,'' Jelinek said.
   Religious activism in this predominantly Roman Catholic country
has been growing in recent years.
   Western analysts said the legalization of the small Apostolic
Church in the Czech lands, several years after it was formally
recognized in the country's other republic, Slovakia, was intended
to mollify criticism abroad about an alleged lack of religious
rights in Czechoslovakia.
   The New Apostolic Church, which draws most of its supporters from
among younger people, will raise the number of officially-recognized
Churches and religious societies in Czechoslovakia to 19, Rude Pravo
said.

   President Jose Napoleon Duarte
on Wednesday accused leftist guerrillas of threatening to disrupt
next month's elections and rejected their proposal that the
balloting be postponed.
   ``This is not a proposal for peace. It is a proposal for war,''
Duarte told journalists during a visit to the Supreme Court.
   The proposal, announced Tuesday by guerrilla leaders in Mexico
City, was virtually rejected that afternoon by Fidel Chavez Mena,
the presidential candidate of Duarte's Christian Democratic Party.
   The Marxist-led insurgents have been battling the U.S.-backed
government for nine years. They offered to participate in the
presidential election if it were postponed from March 19 to
September and other conditions were met.
   The rebels have rejected as ``farce'' all five elections held
this decade, claiming they formed part of what the insurgents call a
``U.S.-imposed counterinsurgency project.''
   ``The proposal is plagued with unconstitutionalities,'' Duarte
said of the guerrilla offer.
   The Constitution says presidential elections must be held no
later than two months before the end of the the 5-year presidential
term. Duarte's term ends June 1, making March 31 the latest
constitutional election date.
   The guerrillas said in their document they would accept the
extension of Duarte's administration until the new election date.
   Duarte, who is dying of liver cancer, said: ``I don't accept the
idea of remaining in the presidency even one minute after the end of
my term.''
   The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, also
rejected the guerrilla proposal as unconstitutional. Arena candidate
Alfredo Cristiani is leading Chavez Mena in recent polls.
   Duarte said the positive element of the guerrilla proposal was
that ``for the first time they recognize there is a solution apart
from the solution of violence.''
   Still, Duarte said the proposal was one of war.
   He cited the paragraph of the guerrilla document that reads:
``The conditions of the current electoral scheme makes it
illegitimate. For that reason the FMLN has rejected the elections,
and as long as they are not modified, the FMLN will maintain its
position of accompanying the people in rejecting the current
elections. This electoral process aggravates the war. Our proposal
contributes to peace.''
   Duarte said: ``There are the threats. They're talking about
attacks, escalating the war.''
   Guerrilla sources have indicated that if the proposal were
rejected, they would step up attacks.
   The war has killed an estimated 65,000 people, mostly civilians.
Three rounds of talks between 1984 and 1987 ended in stalemate.
   Duarte said he was not closing the door on the guerrillas.
   ``I have said I would talks with any and all who declare publicly
without conditions that violence is not the way to resolve the
country's problems and that they are ready to incorporate themselves
into the democratic process,'' he said.
   The left-leaning National Union of Salvadoran Workers supported
the guerrilla proposal on Wednesday.
   ``It is a demonstration of good will by the insurgents, who want
to find a political solution to the conflict,'' the group said in a
communique.
   The leftist Democratic Convergence also supports the guerrilla
proposal. Guillermo Ungo, the party's presidential candidate, called
it ``an important contribution to the peace process that could
convert elections from a means of prolonging the war to a means of
peace.''

   A man who ate two cans of sardines in a
store and tried to steal money to pay for them deserves his
conviction, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday, but his crime
does not merit life in prison.
   The high court upheld the burglary conviction of Clyde Ashley Jr.
and ordered a new sentencing hearing.
   In essence, the state high court said the trial judge erred in
levying the life sentence without parole even though Ashley had many
previous convictions. According to the court records, Ashley, 44,
was paroled on Dec. 13, 1985 after spending 23 years of his life in
prison for a series of burglaries and an attempted robbery, each
committed while under the influence of alcohol.
   ``Once more while drinking Ashley rather pathetically and
pitifully again ran afoul of the law,'' said Justice James
Robertson, writing for the court.
   The court said on Jan. 15, 1986, Ashley, after being rebuffed in
attempts to get money from 85-year-old Eva Washington, entered a
small grocery store in Osyka in Pike County and was seen opening and
eating two cans of sardines.
   The owner of the store cornered Ashley and demanded payment.
Ashley told him he would go to his aunt's house to get some money.
   The owner went with Ashley, who took him to Washington's house.
The store owner waited, called police when Ashley did not return,
and Ashley was found hiding in a closet in Washington's home.
   On March 18, 1986, Ashley was convicted of burglary. In a
separate sentencing hearing, the trial judge ruled Ashley was a
habitual offender and sentenced him to life without parole.
   Robertson wrote that the ``seemingly undue harshness'' of the
sentence ``for Ashley's great sardine caper is evidenced'' by
comments from prosecutors that they would not oppose a lighter
sentence.
   Robertson said while the trial judge could have reduced the
sentence, he did not. ``Our law is susceptible of mechincal
operation, nor are our courts robots,'' the justice wrote.

   Congress wasted little time sticking a pin into
President Bush's trial balloon suggesting that depositors pay for
rescuing the savings and loan industry.
   Bush's Treasury secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, said Wednesday his
staff is looking into a variety of revenue-raising options,
including a proposal to charge depositors in banks, S&amp;Ls and credit
unions a 25-cent fee for every $100 in their accounts.
   Bush, in an interview, stressed that he hasn't made any
decisions, but he said, ``That is one option.''
   The trial balloon stirred a furor on Capitol Hill where Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., predicted, ``It's going to be blown out of
the water.'' Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, said through an aide, ``There
is not a member of the (banking) committee who would vote for it.''

   All over America, bankers and their depositors are taking
potshots at what looks to them like a Bush administration tax that
fails the administration's own ``duck test.'' To them, it looks like
a duck, it quacks like a duck, and it's a tax in duck's feathers.
   In question is a proposal, offered by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and defended as ``one option'' by President Bush, to impose a
fee of 25 cents on every $100 deposited into a federally insured
savings and loan institution, bank or credit union.
   The revenue raised would help bail out the government's S&amp;L
insurance fund.
   ``I think it is a terrible idea,'' Gerald Martel, president of
First Federal Savings and Loan of Lewiston, Maine, said Wednesday
when the idea first flew.

   A veteran Cuban diplomat who defected to the
United States says he was a regular participant in a
Palestinian-backed gun-running operation on behalf of rebel groups
in three Latin American countries.
   Hector Aguililla Saladrigas, who spent most of his 14-year
diplomatic career involved in Middle East affairs, said he defected
last fall after becoming disillusioned with Cuba's subversive
activities and widespread official corruption.
   Aguililla's defection was not publicly disclosed until the State
Department made him available for an interview Tuesday with the
Associated Press.
   He had been assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Madagascar but last
October 10, during a transit stop while en route to take up his
duties there, he asked U.S. officials for political asylum for
himself, his wife and two children, aged 13 and 10. He declined to
say where the request was made.

   Sen. George Mitchell used his inaugural address
as Senate majority leader to offer President Bush ``true
bipartisanship'' on foreign policy while pushing a distinctly
Democratic agenda on domestic issues.
   The Maine Democrat's proposals include boosting the minimum wage,
improving the lot of the homeless, assuring day care for the
children of workers and investing in education, housing and
improving the environment.
   Mitchell said that while Bush recognized many of these needs in
his presidential inaugural address last Friday, ``he has yet to tell
us how he proposes to meet them.''
   On the Senate's first working day of the 101st Congress,
Mitchell, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas and other

retreads from the past, some representing new initiatives.

   Ronald H. Brown, the establishment lawyer who

   Brown's ascension to the Democratic Party chairmanship became all
but certain Wednesday when he was endorsed by his chief rival for
the post.
   It was a remarkably swift triumph for the 47-year-old political
veteran who grew up in Harlem but attended predominantly white
schools on New York's Upper East Side.
   His parents were graduates of Howard University, one of the
nation's premier black colleges, but they sent their only child to
Middlebury College in Vermont, where he was one of the few blacks.
He now serves on the college's board of trustees and is chairman of
the board of the Kennedy Institute for Politics at Harvard.

   Serial killer Ted Bundy, executed this week, may
have killed more than 100 girls and young women in murderous sex
rages from coast to coast, says an investigator who tracked him for
15 years.
   ``My feeling is he has killed way over 100,'' said Bob Keppel,
who as a King County detective investigated the eight ``Ted''
killings that occurred in western Washington in 1974, the first that
were connected to Bundy.
   In a frenzy of last-minute confessions that brought Keppel and a
parade of investigators from other states to Florida State Prison,
Bundy confessed to all eight and 15 more nationwide, and provided
information on dozens of others.
   Keppel, now a Washington state attorney general's investigator,
acknowledged that exact numbers may never be known and offered no
details to support his estimate at a news conference Wednesday.

   Embattled junk bond wizard Michael R. Milken is
being fired from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. without last year's
reported nine-digit pay, according to a plea bargain to settle the
nation's largest securities fraud case.
   The bad news for Milken, considered the driving force behind
Drexel's leap from obscurity to become the fifth largest U.S.
securities firm, came in a 12-page plea agreement signed by Drexel
officials Tuesday and made public Wednesday.
   Under the agreement, Drexel will not be prosecuted for any
activities in the last decade involving its bond traders or its
dealings with now-imprisoned stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky. In
exchange, the firm agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and
pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution.
   Drexel also agreed it would not pay Milken's brother, senior
company aide Lowell J. Milken, half of what is due him for 1988.

   You can play in Peoria, but if you're in a

   As of Wednesday, the police and fire departments stopped rescuing
kittens from trees, pumping flooded basements or handling any number
of extra duties that once were considered routine. The new policy
has prompted some to wonder if this quintessential Midwest town is
losing its heartland values.
   ``Peoria's definitely losing its small-town flavor but we think
it's more important to be prepared to respond to emergencies rather
than spending time and money on extracurricular activities like
these,'' says Fire Marshal G. John Parker.
   Parker explained that financial concerns prompted officials to
stop helping residents who are locked out of their homes, or
motorists who have locked their keys inside their cars _ unless it's
an emergency.

   Dennis wears an electronic band around his
ankle, a constant reminder of his criminal record. For the privilege
of wearing it and being at home instead of in prison, he surrenders
half his paycheck.
   When he leaves the house and feels a fresh breeze, and watches it
rustle the leaves on trees, Dennis figures he's got a pretty good
deal.
   ``It's better than being in prison. I pay and I leave for home
and then I can see the trees and it's worth it. It's just part of me
now.''
   If trends continue, there will be twice as many offenders in the
United States being monitored with electronic tethers this year as
the 2,300 a day in a February 1988 National Institute of Justice
survey, said David Dillingham of the National Institute of
Corrections, part of the Justice Department.
   A December survey of manufacturers revealed that since the first
test of the tethers in 1983 in Albuquerque, N.M., some 11,000 have
been shipped, said Marc Renzema, a Kutztown (Pa.) University
criminal justice professor who publishes the newsletter ``Offender
Monitoring.''
   Michigan has 1,100 people in its program, more than any other
state, said Richard Brummer, a vice president of B.I. Inc. of
Boulder, Colo., the largest of 11 producers of house arrest devices.
Florida, with 650, is No. 2.
   The tethers _ smaller than a cigarette pack and less than 5
ounces _ have replaced Michigan's extended furlough program, in
which convicts were released and told they had to stay home when not
at work or school. That hasn't changed; what has changed is that
those rules now can be enforced.
   ``There wasn't the staff and manpower to call somebody repeatedly
seven days a week. Now we know to the minute when somebody's coming
and going,'' said Laura Young, supervisor for one of the state's
three monitoring centers.
   ``If someone's curfew is 8 p.m., we're taking steps by 8:10 p.m.
if they're not home yet. Before it just wasn't done. A person could
be gone for seven days. Now, for inmates, at four hours, if we can't
locate them they go in the Law Enforcement Information Network
computer system as an escapee.''
   The typical participant was convicted of a property crime,
behaved well in prison and has 15 to 18 months before eligibility
for parole. Sex offenders, violent criminals, major drug dealers and
career criminals are barred.
   The tether is attached to an ankle by a plastic strap. The
watertight unit is coded to a device attached to a phone in the
inmate's home. If the signal is interrupted when the prisoner is
supposed to be home, or if either device is tampered with, the
transmitter sends a message to the monitoring center.
   About 3 percent of the tethered inmates in Michigan have escaped
and fewer than 2 percent have become repeat felons.
   ``It will never be as secure as a jail cell. We don't nail the
front door shut,'' said Brummer, whose company services 60
jurisdictions in 30 states.
   In Florida, the anklets _ or less restrictive wristlets and
pagers _ are used as a punishment somewhere between prison and
probation, said corrections department spokesman Bob Macmaster.
   In Michigan, about $4.9 million has been budgeted for the program
this year, but the corrections department expects to collect $1.8
million in fees from prisoners. The daily cost of phones and
equipment averages $6 per inmate. Working participants must turn
over half their salaries, not to exceed the cost to the state. The
average daily reimbursement per inmate in 1988 was $3.20.
   The state estimates that's about half the cost of a day in jail
or prison.
   In addition to easing prison crowding, the tether program gives
convicts a chance at a head start on an education or training
program, as well as allowing them to earn money and live with family.
   Dennis, who asked that his last name not be published, served
time for breaking and entering. He lives with his parents while
studying electronics and working as a security guard, and must wear
the tether until he is eligible for parole in May 1990.
   ``It doesn't discourage me. Time is not standing still, it's
going forward,'' he said. ``This kind of keeps me in line, it helps
me remember. This is my friend.''

   The 8-year-old girl offers up a piece of paper
and a pen and pleads, ``Could you just write one more?''
   ``You just want to be a big cheese in school, don't ya?'' says
Ringo Starr, cigarette dangling from his mouth, as he cheerfully
signs another autograph.
   The girl, Nicole Leach, is no pint-size autograph hound, but one
of Starr's co-stars on ``Shining Time Station,'' a new PBS
children's series that premieres Saturday.
   Starr, the rest of the cast and the producers had just completed
a cross-country promotional tour for ``Shining Time Station,'' which
has gotten more than the usual dollop of publicity due even the most
charming of children's programs _ which ``Shining Time Station'' is
_ thanks to the presence of the former Beatle in the cast.
   ``We all know it's the truth. It's a lot of easier if I'm on the
tour, too, because people want to come and ask what you've been
doin' for the last 100 years. But somewhere in there they mention
the show,'' said Starr, chatting in a suite overlooking Central Park.
   Starr is already a children's star in England where he is heard
but not seen as the narrator on the popular tot-appeal ``Thomas the
Tank Engine and Friends,'' a storybook segment included in ``Shining
Time Station.''
   ``I'm savaged by 5-year-olds,'' he says, laughing.
   In the American show, Starr plays Mr. Conductor, a tiny
special-effects figure who lives in the walls of the train station,
popping up occasionally to entertain the children and help teach the
simple lessons aimed at the program's target audience, 4- to
7-year-olds.
   ``I've always enjoyed children,'' Starr said. His own three
children are grown and he has a 3-year-old granddaughter, Tatia.
   ``The songs in the old days, I sort of went to the kiddie crowd,
so it was sort of a natural thing, you know,'' he said. ``But to be
magic and little, it was fabulous.''
   Britt Allcroft, co-creator and producer of the show with Rick
Siggelkow, said she talked Starr into narrating ``Thomas the Tank
Engine and Friends'' in England after hearing him on the television
in another room.
   ``I heard this voice being interviewed, and I thought, that's the
voice of Thomas' storyteller,'' she said.
   She calls the show ``storybook television _ television
programming that has sort of qualities more akin to those you'd find
in children's literature.''
   Starr said he ``can't wait'' to be as big a kiddie star in this
country as he is in England. After all, his career has not exactly
been booming.
   ``The first half of the last 100 years, I was really busy doing
albums and records and films and everything, and then it all started
sort of slowing down and slowing down, and lately I haven't been
doin' much at all.
   ``So I'm just pleased of this opportunity,'' he says with mock
pitifulness.
   He said part of the reason for the career slide was his recently
admitted alcohol problem. He and wife Barbara Bach checked into an
unidentified substance-abuse clinic in the United States last year.
   ``Yeah, I had an alcohol problem,'' Starr, 48, said. ``I still
have the problem, of course, but I don't drink anymore. I've had the
problem for a long time. It's been three months to yesterday that I
haven't had a drink _ 90 days. I had to get help, and I got help,
and I'm feeling better. It was just getting on top of me.''
   A deal to star in an American television sitcom never
materialized last season, but Starr hasn't been totally idle. He
sang ``When You Wish Upon a Star'' for ``Stay Awake,'' an album
compiled of Walt Disney tunes sung by various rock stars. And he has
his own compilation coming out Feb. 28 on Rhino Records called
``Starr Struck.''
   ``I'm pulling myself together. I'm sort of starting the year off
now, and we'll do what we're going to do. There's really nothing
laying around _ `Oh, I've got this in the pipeline, and I'm reading
these scripts.' There's nothing like that at all. We're startin' the
year clean. So, be interesting if you come and see me in December,
and you'll see what happened _ `Oh, didn't do a thing, eh?'''

<HEAD>God Seen Expressed Through Madonna And Other ``Pop'' Entertainment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may seem odd to say that God speaks through
the work of such entertainers as rock musician Bruce Springsteen,
filmmaker Woody Allen and the singer-actress Madonna.
   But that it happens is the studied conclusion of a exploratory
and versatile Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Andrew Greeley of
Chicago.
   He maintains that they and a procession of other purveyors of
``pop'' art, including romance novels, westerns, mysteries and comic
strips, are frequent channels of divine grace.
   ``God may indeed be encountered in works of the lively arts which
ordinary people enjoy,'' Greeley says, but ``high-culture'' critics
and church officials generally look down on such output.
   Just because it's enjoyable and thus immensely popular, he says,
doesn't mean it's not good, and it also needn't be overtly religious
to convey notes of the sacred.
   After all, he adds, many of the parables of Jesus were utterly
secular, without specified religious content, yet were loaded with
sanctifying import and meaning.
   ``Grace is everywhere,'' Greeley says, and ``is especially to be
sought in popular culture'' because of its demonstrated huge appeal
and influence.
   Greeley, scholarly sociologist and also best-selling novelist
with 110 books to his credit in both fields, advances his thesis in
a new book, ``God in Popular Culture,'' published by Thomas Moore
Press of Chicago.
   ``I suppose the elitists will ridicule the idea of finding God in
science fiction, mystery stories, pop singers and comic strips,'' he
said in a telephone interview from his spring semester teaching post
at the University of Arizona.
   ``That's their problem, not mine. But God lurks everywhere.
   ``What I'm doing is nothing more than the song in the book of
Job. God speaks through the stars in the sky and also through the
storytellers and singers today. He reveals himself through them.''
   Greeley, 60, details a case for this in a variety of ``pop''
output and performers _ western film actor Clint Eastwood, singer
Linda Ronstadt, horror novelist Stephen King, TV's domestic-life
comic Bill Cosby and others.
   Describing Cosby as ``an evangelist,'' Greeley says he is ``the
most influential religion teacher in America'' through the
``paradigms of love'' on his TV series about a black family.
   ``A modern version of the medieval morality play has slipped into
prime-time television almost without anyone noticing,'' Greeley
writes.
   He calls actor-filmmaker Allen a ``God-haunted person,'' his work
always preoccupied with the ``God question,'' even if dubious about
his existence.
   ``It is humor that has provided the opening for him to become the
most explicitly theological filmmaker in America today,'' Greeley
says.
   Of the singer-actress Madonna with her flamboyant attire and
streetwise candor, Greeley says ``she demands for young women the
right to be what their bodies demand of them _ simultaneously virgin
and siren.''
   Citing her song, ``Like a Virgin,'' about a lover who treated her
like a virgin, shiny and new, instead of like a used-up discarded
thing, Greeley describes it as ``the timeless cry of the human heart
for renewal.''
   He says the song's ``most gentle and tender of human lovers is a
hint of what God is like.''
   Greeley says much of Springsteen's rock music is ``deeply
religious'' and asks ``serious questions about what life means. .. .
He is a major religious prophet.'' His ``Tunnel of Love'' album may
be ``more important'' than a papal visit.
   He ``sings of religious realities _ sin, temptation, forgiveness,
life, death, hope _ in images that appeal to the whole person, not
just the head, and which will be absorbed by far more Americans than
listened to the pope,'' Greeley writes.
   ``Troubadours always have been more important than theologians or
bishops.''
   About the laconic film hero Eastwood, Greeley examines
particularly his film, ``Pale Rider,'' terming its leading character
who appears in response to a prayer a ``proto-Christ figure.''
   Eastwood's films ``reveal, ever more starkly, our hunger for a
saving paladin,'' Greeley says.
   He says big-selling romances, spurned or lampooned by critics,
deal ``explicitly with the question of whether human aspirations can
possibly be fulfilled. Can we overcome? Can we love?''
   The romances' answer ``is that we can if we work at it and up to
a point,'' he says. ``It is a modest enough answer'' and however
flat the plot and characters, it is ``more reassuring and hopeful''
than the negativism usually demanded by academics and critics.
   Of comic strips, Greeley says some ``are terrible'' but some
offer ``some of the best wit, social commentary and moral philosophy
to be found anywhere in contemporary America.''
   There are ``few better sources of irony in the world than the
comic pages,'' he says, and ``irony is, finally, an essential
ingredient of any valid theology. For irony sees the folly of human
pretensions.
   ``It is the counterweight to all idolatries.''

<HEAD>Some Ideas For Increasing Savings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frustration and lamentation long have been
associated with the low personal savings rate in America, and the
latest to join the crowd is Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board.
   Speaking before the House Banking Committee, the erudite analyst
of all things economic, confessed that in at least one area he was
baffled. He too, he said, had little idea of how to get people to
save more.
   But there are plenty of savings ideas floating around, and some
of them might work. But just as importantly, there are many ideas
about the savings rate that say it isn't nearly as low as a lot of
folks think it is.
   Statistically speaking, the U.S. rate is low. During the period
from 1947 to 1981 it averaged 4.8 percent of gross national product.
From 1982 to 1987 it averaged 3.7 percent. But the trend may have
reversed.
   More recent figures indicate that in the first half of 1988 the
rate averaged 4.1 percent, up from 3.2 percent in 1987. In that time
it reached a low of 1.8 percent in August 1987 and a high of 4.3
percent in June 1988.
   How do these numbers compare with other nations? Terribly.
Japan's personal savings rate, for example, is sometimes higher than
20 percent. Several other nations are near or close to double
digits. The United States is near bottom.
   But hold on! Do these statistics really say that Americans are
unable or unwilling to save? Maybe not.
   Among the more effective critics of the low-savings theory is
Edward Yardeni, an individualist among a fraternity of like
thinkers. Let us not forget the baby boomers, says Yardeni,
Prudential-Bache director of economics.
   Yardeni maintains that much of the lowered savings rate is a
result of the bulge of young people working its way through the
economy. He observes that the baby boomers _ born after World War II
_ have been in the expensive period of life, financing housing,
furniture, babies, education, cars and the like.
   Baby boomers, he points out, now are becoming couch potatoes.
They are retiring from the spending mode and entering a slacker,
more reflective time of life. Figuratively, they are sitting on the
couch watching television.
   As a result, Yardeni bravely forecasts a sharp rise in the
savings rate from 4 percent or so to 10 percent over the next five
years.
   Paul Craig Roberts, the assistant secretary of the Treasury for
economic policy under President Reagan who now is chairman of the
Institute for Policy Economy, not only cites Yardeni's thesis but
adds other evidence.
   A methodological quirk, for example, is involved in the low
savings rate. Says Roberts: ``In computing GNP, rental values are
imputed to housing and counted as consumption whether the housing is
owned or rented by occupant,''
   Any time, therefore, that there is a demographic bulge of
household-forming young adults, the ``consumption'' of housing will
rise relative to disposable income. But, in a practical sense,
buying a house helps more people put more money away for future use
than any other tool conceived by mankind.
   But are there ways to raise the savings rate as measured
traditionally? Of course _ through incentives. An important
incentive, the Individual Retirement Account, already exists,
although badly watered down.
   A possible incentive could be engineered through a change in the
tax laws that would reduce the amount of taxes on interest earned.
All interest on savings is now subject to taxes. There is a
disincentive to save.
   Various proposals have been made to allow freedom from taxes for
the first few thousand dollars in savings accounts. Other proposals
would include an expansion of IRAs, on which taxes are deferred
until retirement age, to include money saved for meeting education
expenses or the down payment on a house.
   Why not? Isn't education an investment for the national good?
Isn't a fully-owned house one of the best retirement insurance
programs in existence?
   While he expressed concern over his inability to conceive ways to
raise savings rates, Greenspan already is doing something about it.
In seeking to keep inflation restrained, he is restoring faith in
the importance of saving.
   That faith was shattered in the 1970s, and many people will never
forget it. While savers lent their money to banks for as little as
5.25 percent interest in passbook accounts, raging inflation cut the
buying power of those savings to a fraction.
   Those who borrowed prospered because they repaid in cheaper
dollars. Those who saved financed the new wealth of borrowers while
going broke themselves. It takes time to forget.

<HEAD>Dust, Duvall and `Lonesome Dove' Turning Point for Urich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Urich is sipping juice in a coffee shop on
Central Park South. Across the street the carriage horses, blanketed
against the cold, shift from one foot to the other and wait for a
fare.
   Urich is talking horses. Hundreds of horses. Stampeding horses.
And the heat and dust of filming ``Lonesome Dove'' in south Texas
last year.
   The four-part CBS miniseries, based on Larry McMurtry's epic
Western novel, airs Feb. 5-8.
   Urich, best-known as a TV private eye in ``Vegas'' and ``Spenser:
For Hire,'' had gone to a riding stable to brush up on his
horsemanship before the the filming.
   ``It's one thing riding in a ring with an instructor telling me
to do this and do that,'' he said, ``than to be out on some
God-forsaken prairieland where everything that grows has thorns and
to have Robert Duvall turn to you and say, `OK, boys, let's jump
some gullies!'
   ``There were scenes where we were supposed to be driving 150 head
of wild horses. ... Tommy Lee (Jones), who's a terrific horseman,
... he was telling me, `Bobby, whatever you do don't get
perpendicular to these horses, because one punches you sideways, all
the rest of 'em are gonna run over you. ... I was scared to death!''
   Duvall and Jones play Augustus McCrae and Woodrow Call,
respectively; they're two aging, former Texas Rangers who aim to
push a huge herd of cattle to Montana and start a ranch. Urich plays
against type as womanizing card sharp Jake Spoon, their
irresponsible friend.
   ``You hear actors talk about finally lining up with a character
and a place and time where everything just seems not only a creative
experience, but a personal experience, and that's what this was for
me,'' Urich said. ``I felt like I grew as a human being. I really
connected up with this thing.''
   Ironically, he turned the role down twice, not having read the
book that inspires adoration from its readers, and not knowing other
actors were climbing all over each other trying to get a part in the
miniseries.
   Simon Wincer (``Man From Snowy River'') directed. Bill Witliff
(``Raggedy Man,'' ``Country'') is executive producer and wrote the
screenplay.
   Urich said that despite his exhaustion after three years of ABC's
``Spenser,'' which was not picked up for the 1988-89 season, he
decided he had to do ``Lonesome Dove.'' On the same screen with
Duvall, Jones and the rest of the cast, which includes Anjelica
Huston and Diane Lane, he figured he would finally be measured as a
serious actor.
   Urich will do more to change his image next fall when he stars in
a new series for NBC, tentatively titled ``American Dreamer,''
produced by Gary David Goldberg, creator of ``Family Ties.'' Urich
will play what he describes as a Charles Kuralt-type character whose
travels and recollections make for something of an ``Our Town'' for
television.
   ``We want to try to do timely things. Gary said that's the nice
thing about doing this kind of show. Something that's on your mind
on Monday can be on the air on Friday. That really appealed to me,
and not doing another drug-related, embezzlement show,'' Urich said.
   Meanwhile, he and his wife and two young children are moving back
to Los Angeles from Boston, where they lived for the three years
``Spenser'' was filmed there. He said he always felt something like
a fish out of water.
   ``As friendly as (New Englanders) are, I'm this guy from
Hollywood who ought to be driving around in a fancy car and not
taking out my own garbage and raking leaves out front or working
with a chainsaw,'' he said.
   ``I had three extension ladders disappear. ... I couldn't figure
it out. The last one I've got now, I bothered to put my name on it.
It has to be they have to assume, why would a guy from Hollywood
have a ladder? And if he did, he wouldn't know what to do with it
anyway.
   ``But I liked getting in the car and driving to the ski club
which is 10 minutes away, and I liked being close to Maine. But I
don't belong there, which is the final thought, shouldn't really be
there. And coming back to L.A., which I couldn't wait to get out of,
I'm starting to come to terms with, some smog and some traffic,
because I just felt more relaxed.''

figure out what it is yet. ...

<HEAD>So Much For Self-Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the less obvious victims of the wholesale
shenanigans in the securities and commodities marketplaces is the
treasured and fragile concept of self-regulation.
   Millions of Americans are asking themselves these days if it
works _ ``it'' being the belief that buyers, sellers and their
agents, and the general public too, are served best if those who run
the markets also police them.
   Hoping to retain freedom from outside interference, all major
securities and commodity exchanges study trading patterns and other
activities for violations of standards, such as price-rigging,
collusion and misinformation.
   Offenders are fined, suspended from exchanges, banned from
trading and, if required, reported to law officers for possible
prosecution. Most of those caught are relatively little fish; their
ill-fortune hardly roils the waters.
   In recent months, however, some of the biggest fish since the
1930s have been turning up in the nets, not of the self-regulators
but of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And the violations seem
more pervasive than isolated.
   The government's investigation of futures trading and the
possible routine cheating of customers at the Chicago Board of Trade
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, suggests how ineffective
self-policing might have become.
   So well-known were certain questionable futures trading
practices, and so often were they criticized publicly within and
outside the exchanges, that the FBI found reasons to act where the
self-policers had been, if not idle, then ineffective.
   The actions of the Mercantile Exchange following the issuance of
subpoenas, illustrates how unaggressive and impotent self-policing
appears to have become.
   After acknowledging that the exchange itself had studied
activities in the so-called ``yen pit,'' where trades involving the
Japanese yen were conducted, Leo Melamed, chairman of the exchange's
executive committee, stated:
   ``I don't think we could have done any better. The practices and
the way we conduct business gives the opportunity for a violation.
No one watching, just standing there, could have done anything.''
   The Feds did do something. They infiltrated trading pits,
recorded deals being made, observed what they believed to have been
fraud, gathered names, established a grand jury to hear evidence and
arranged for subpoenas.
   The Mercantile Exchange then acted, appointing a 10-member panel
to review trading procedures, a move similar to that made following
accusations that futures trading practices helped worsen the stock
market crash of 1987.
   There would be no sacred cows in its own investigation, said
Melamed. ``We've got to change the rules so even (the) few can't do
anything dishonest with a public order,'' he declared.
   What matters, he said, ``is that we use this opportunity to act
responsibly and make improvements where they are necessary.''
   The exchange-appointed panel that studied the impact of futures
trading in the stock market crash of October 1987 tended to
exonerate the exchange, suggesting instead that it was a bulwark
against even further damage.
   There seems little likelihood that the current panel cannot
suggest changes in trading practices that would allow better
surveillance, improve recording of transactions and eliminate the
confusing, fish market-like pit procedures.
   But whatever corrections emerge from what appears to be another
public trading debacle _ others involve misuse of inside stock
information, trading conspiracies, collusion and the like _ public
confidence has been shaken.
   The entire concept of self-regulation has been put on trial, as
it was in the 1930s, when it was demonstrated that the policemen not
only had reneged on their responsibilities but had used their
authority to mask their misdeeds.
   Those earlier shenanigans resulted in more government regulation.
It took years for the industry to recapture a degree of self-control
and public trust, which it requires if its practitioners are to make
the good living it affords.
   Now the fear exists that they might have tossed it away again,
and with it the entire notion that free markets operate most
efficiently when governmental interference is held to a minimum.

<HEAD>Crusty Texan Takes Over Judiciary Committee</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Army Corps of Engineers general told
Jack Brooks that the federal government would never build the
proposed Sam Rayburn dam, a sneer crossed the face of the crusty
Texas congressman.
   ``General,'' said Brooks as a hush fell over the committee room,
``long after you're gone, I'm still going to be here and so is that
dam.''
   He is. And it is.
   Today, Rayburn Dam stands astride the Angelina River, 10 miles
north of Jasper in East Texas.
   And Brooks, a tough, prickly Texas Democrat, stands astride the
House Judiciary Committee, new chairman of the panel whose authority
ranges over narcotics, gun control, civil rights and a host of other
explosive issues.
   Brooks, a gritty, 66-year-old ex-Marine, is renowned for the
defiant jut of his cigar and putting House committee witnesses on
the griddle.
   Federal bureaucrats who sought to outfox Brooks, until now
chairman of the House Government Operations, have emerged from the
committee room pale and wobbly on their feet after getting a dose of
his treatment.
   In recent years, he pilloried the Air Force for excessive
computer purchases costing an estimated $800 million and savaged the
State Department for a costly attempt to replace the silverware in
U.S. embassies around the globe.
   With a flash of earthy humor, Brooks locked horns with the Reagan
administration over a plan to expand lie-detector tests for federal
employees.
   ``If the polygraph were worth a cotton-picking thing,'' he
snorted, ``every wife in this place would buy one.''
   Brooks was born Dec. 18, 1922, in Crowley, La. His father died
when he was 12 and he was forced to go to work.
   He worked his way through the University of Texas, was a reporter
on his hometown Beaumont Enterprise, served in World War II and
earned a law degree while sitting in the Texas legislature. He won a
House seat in 1952.
   Since then, he has come to dominate the district, and a decade
ago the federal building there was named for him.
   From the start, though, Brooks carved out a political style that
at times verged on the downright ornery.
   In one early campaign, his opponent called Brooks a communist.
His response was pure Brooks.
   He threatened to get a gun and shoot his opponent or anyone else
who repeated the charge. Some old-timers claim he underscored the
point at one stop by taking out a gun and placing it on the dais.
   So proud of his fierce image is Brooks that once, when The
Washington Post published a picture of him wearing an unusually mean
expression, he went from one fellow lawmaker to another jubilantly
showing it off.
   Almost everyone agrees that a key influence was the late Speaker
Sam Rayburn, D-Texas, the most powerful man in Congress when Brooks
arrived.
   ``Mr. Sam'' liked to mete out excruciating political punishments
to those who crossed him and Brooks learned from the old master,
saving his choicest acid-tinged remarks for committee witnesses
caught diverting from the truth.
   ``He has a real penchant for zeroing in on something like that,''
says administrative assistant Sharon Matts. ``He just sort of smells
it.''
   Understandably, Europeans grumbled several years ago when Brooks
became president of the North Atlantic Assembly, a group of
parliamentarians from NATO nations. Their style and his were never
quite in sync.
   Indeed, Brooks once led a junket on which the Americans were
dined royally at a palatial country estate owned by an English
nobleman. Afterward, Brooks toasted the host and, his eye resting
momentarily on an oil portrait over the hearth, added thanks ``to
your daddy, the Duke, who made all this possible.''
   Today, Brooks is a far cry from the awestruck poor boy who came
here three decades ago. A Dallas Times-Herald story in 1978 told how
Brooks engaged in sophisticated real estate and bank investments
that led to some hefty insurance commissions.
   It was all perfectly legal, but the stories showed that behind
the just-folks manner lay a complex mind capable of deft financial
footwork. For a time, Brooks grew testy about it and toward the
author, Paul West.
   One old-time Texas journalist tells how he sat down next to
Brooks at a Texas delegation meeting and was asked by the
congressman if he happened to know West. The answer was yes.
   Brooks fell silent a moment, blew an immense cloud of cigar smoke
into the air and said finally, ``I'd like to take that boy
a-huntin'.''

   It's beginning to look like Broadway in Britain as
New York shows hit London in a reversal of the usual westward flow.
   No fewer than 10 recent New York productions are now running in
London or will open shortly, including some that failed financially
in the United States, and others that might seem unlikely candidates
for British transfers.
   American plays and musicals have always been featured on the
London stage, from Arthur Miller plays, some of which are now
running, to musical revivals such as the current ``Brigadoon'' and
the recently closed ``South Pacific'' and ``Can-Can.''
   But what's surprising about the rest of the American lineup is
its specific resemblance to that of New York's current fare. Among
American shows already running are the off-Broadway musical ``Three
Guys Naked From the Waist Down'' at the Donmar Warehouse; David
Mamet's Broadway hit ``Speed-the-Plow'' at the government-subsidized
National; and the two-character ``A Walk in the Woods,'' at the
Comedy, which ended its commercially unsuccessful Broadway run last
June.
   Soon to arrive are stand-up comic Jackie Mason's solo show, ``The
World According to Me,'' which starts its six-week run Feb. 15 at
the Playhouse; the satiric revue ``Forbidden Broadway,'' opening
March 2 at the Fortune and subtitled ``The West End Edition''; and
Robert Harling's ``Steel Magnolias,'' due March 7 at the Lyric.
   Add the spring premieres of ``M. Butterfly,'' ``Frankie and
Johnny in the Clair de Lune'' and Jerry Zaks' spirited revival of
``Anything Goes,'' and clearly what plays in New York is
increasingly deemed a safe bet to play in London.
   Mason appeared to prove the point in November when his brief
appearance on the annual Royal Variety Show won universal critical
acclaim. Until then New York Jewish shtick invariably bombed in
Britain.
   Part of the sudden interest in American productions is that they
fill the gap left by those British playwrights who are either
writing less frequently or have switched to other media.
   In shopping for products, creators and producers emphasize that
their work transcends parochial, national boundaries.
   ``I'm doing `Steel Magnolias' because I think this is a
particular play that's universal,'' said David Pugh, who is
producing the British debut of the long-running off-Broadway hit set
in a Louisiana beauty parlor.
   Directed by actress Julia McKenzie, the comedy will star
British-born Rosemary Harris, a Broadway regular, and Joely
Richardson, the younger of Vanessa Redgrave's two thespian daughters.
   ``It happens to be as relevant in Stoke-on-Trent as it is in
Louisiana,'' said Pugh, who in 1987 co-produced Lyle Kessler's
``Orphans,'' an earlier London production of an American play and
one which closed at a deficit.
   In the case of ``Speed-the-Plow,'' David Mamet is seen as an
international writer who merits inclusion in the repertory of any
major theater.
   ``He has very much been a writer for the National,'' said David
Aukin, executive director of the theater where the author's Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' had its world premiere in 1983.
   ``Speed-the-Plow,'' which starred Ron Silver, Joe Mantegna and
rock singer Madonna who was roasted by critics, opens Jan. 25 with a
mixed Canadian and British cast.
   American writers, in turn, enjoy the prestige of a London run.
Terrence McNally, whose ``Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune''
is in its second year off-Broadway, said he was as excited about
that play's London opening in May as he would be if it were the New
York debut.
   The London production's two-character cast consists of Britons
Brian Cox and Julie Walters, who was Rita in ``Educating Rita.''
   ``London is very special to me; it's not just another
engagement,'' McNally, 49, said by telephone from New York,
dismissing worries that a romance set in Hell's Kitchen might be too
American to travel.
   ``I can't worry about that when I write,'' he said. Shows work
when you're very specific. It's when you try to appeal to everybody
that you get into trouble.
   McNally's musical ``The Rink'' flopped in London last year as it
had earlier on Broadway.
   The fate of ``The Rink'' and ``Orphans'' indicates that London
productions aren't always the money-makers dreamed of by scarred
veterans of New York's hit-flop mentality.
   Neither ``Follies,'' the 1971 Stephen Sondheim musical which ends
its debut London engagement Feb. 4, nor ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' the
Alfred Uhry comedy which finished six months on the West End last
November, fully recouped its investment. But the West End's lower
costs are appealing. Both ``Steel Magnolias'' and ``Forbidden
Broadway: The West End Edition'' cost 200,000 pounds ($375,000
dollars), equal to or less than the price of today's average
off-Broadway show.
   The theatrical traffic is not, of course, entirely one way.
   ``Shirley Valentine,'' the one-woman play by Liverpudlian Willy
Russell, opens at Broadway's Booth Theater on Feb. 16.
   Such London hits as ``Lend Me a Tenor'' (written by an American)
and ``Run For Your Wife'' open in March on Broadway, and Peter
Shaffer's much-awaited ``Lettice and Lovage'' has been postponed for
Broadway until next season because its star, Maggie Smith, has
broken a shoulder.

<TEXT>
   It was just like old times when John Melcher
got together with agribusiness consultant Martin Sorkin for lunch at
the Watergate the other day.
   With one glaring exception.
   ``I told him that this time I would pay, and I did, indeed,
pay,'' confesses the 64-year-old Democrat, who last November lost
his bid for a third Senate term from Montana.
   Gone are the days when Melcher, an affable, white-haired
veterinarian known as ``Doc,'' could assume that the lunch tab would
be picked up by someone else.
   ``They used to call me,'' says the Democratic veteran of 12 years
in the House and seven in the Senate. ``Now I call them.''
   It was a close election. A turnaround of 7,000 votes would have
given Melcher a new, six-year lease on his Senate office.
   But Melcher ran into a GOP challenger, Conrad Burns, who was a
popular farm broadcaster at a time when his own base in the Grain
Belt was getting shaky after four years of drought and unpopular
policies blamed on Washington.
   Television ads featuring talking cows that boosted Melcher in
1982 proved a bust this time in a state anxious to shed its bucolic
image and spotlight an above-average education level as a means to
lure new, high-tech industries.
   Melcher also declares ruefully that he played into Republican
hands in dealing with a sensitive bill to preserve Montana
wilderness areas. He ended up losing support among both
conservations and the lumber industry.
   When the election was over, so was Melcher's congressional
career. His colleagues gave him a loyal sendoff.
   ``He has protected the rights of farmers in Montana and fought
for fairness in public power systems,'' declared Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., in a farewell to Melcher from the Senate floor.
   Fast Eddie and Abigail, a pair of cats that had romped through
his office at will in happier times, also had to go. An aide took
one and the senator himself bundled the other into his car and took
it to live in his suburban Maryland home.
   Then Melcher sat down to write letters and make phone calls on
behalf of aides already looking for new jobs. About half are now
employed while others are still hunting or have decided the time has
come to retire.
   Melcher himself is not planning to retire and there are two
reasons why.
   ``I have to earn some money,'' he says. ``I can live off my
retirement in Montana but if I want to stay here I've got to do
something.''
   Moving back to Montana, he says, would provide him with a more
pleasant place to live. But that would mean saying goodbye to the
issues that he has been campaigning for over almost two decades.
That is the second reason why he refuses to retire.
   Working off a borrowed desk in a downtown law firm, Melcher is
offering his services as a consultant on those issues. That is, as a
lobbyist.
   ``Well, call it what you may,'' he says, ``I think we have a
tendency to say consult but it's lobbying.''
   In that, Melcher is like scores of former lawmakers who stay on
in Washington after they retire or lose elections _ they move into
downtown suites and earn their living as hired guns in the
never-ending battle of Gucci Gulch.
   Senate rules designed to head off conflicts of interest bar
Melcher from contacting his former Senate colleagues about bills for
one year. But he is free to testify when their committees hold
hearings on bills. And he is free to ply the corridors of the
Agriculture Department on behalf of clients.
   Melcher already has one client, the Society for Animal Protection
Legislation.
   ``I have a profound interest in the well-being of primates that
are used in medical experiments,'' says Melcher. He says they
deserve decent surroundings and the company of their fellow
creatures.
   A broader plan Melcher is working on would establish a coalition
to fight potential cuts in the Food for Peace program, an
Agriculture Department export subsidy designed to give grain
companies an incentive to provide food for the hungry people of the
world.
   ``Those are the two items I'm working on now,'' says Melcher, who
pauses to reflect for a moment, then adds, ``I'm open to others.''

   Joyce Cowfer was in tears when she called Pat
Hennin with the news that she'd miscalcuated the size of her
foundation and realized it would cost nearly $1,000 more to build
her Maryland home.
   Not to worry, said Hennin, co-owner of the Shelter Institute and
Cowfer's former instructor. He consoled her, patiently explained how
to correct her blunder and even drew diagrams and mailed them to her.
   Within a few months she was done: three bedrooms, two baths,
passive solar heat and a Jacuzzi, and all for $55,000 _ about
one-third market value.
   ``They not only give you the information, they give you the
confidence,'' Cowfer said. ``You don't need building experience.''
   For 15 years, Hennin, his wife Patsy and several other
instructors have taught students how to tackle the forbidding task
of building a home _ at less than half the cost of buying the
finished home or hiring someone to build it.
   People who build their own homes are more satisfied, Hennin said.
Less hurried than a contractor, the do-it-yourselfer will examine
every aspect of the building process and make carefully considered
decisions.
   ``Contractors don't shop around'' and generally do not match
solutions to specific problems, he said. The contractor ``simply
does it this way because that's the way they've always done it.''
   More than 14,000 students from around the world, including
novices who barely knew which end of the hammer to hold, have
attended the school located in a 120-year-old brick building in this
coastal town north of Portland. The students range in age from 18 to
70 and have included lumberjacks, doctors, Madison Avenue
executives, carpenters, engineers and architects.
   Students can choose the 15-week, one-day-a-week session for $450
per person or $725 per couple, or opt for compressed sessions of two
or three weeks for slightly more money. Classes are limited to 40
students.
   All students learn how to survey a lot, pour a foundation, design
and build every inch of a house. They also receive instruction in
the concept of heat, the physics of materials, engineering, framing
and financing.
   The information ``was presented in such a way that it was
non-intimidating,'' said Gary Miers, 34, who is spending $50,000 to
build a house valued at $140,000 in Raymond. ``It was presented in a
relaxed fashion.''
   Mistakes aren't ruinous, Hennin said, because ``there isn't
anything in a house that isn't forgiving.''
   That's comforting for students who also quickly learn that the
mistakes they make are much less costly than if a contractor were
building the house.
   ``When a contractor walks into a store, he doesn't ask what the
price is. He just assumes he's getting the wholesale cost,'' but the
price may be lower elsewhere, Hennin said. ``Contractors don't shop
around.''
   For example, a shelter institute student can make insulated glass
windows for about $3 per square foot, whereas a contractor is likely
to pay $10, Hennin said. All the lumber to build a house rarely
would be over $4,000, he added.
   The Hennins, both 45, began their business in 1974. Hennin, who
had just finished law school and had some prior building experience,
was hired to help build a house for a friend. Soon he had other
offers to build, and his wife's interest in home construction
surfaced.
   ``We had a choice of building houses for the rest of our lives or
getting involved in another way _ teaching people,'' Mrs. Hennin
said.
   Housing styles have changed over the last 15 years. After the
simple, box-style homes that marked the days of energy conservation
and the back-to-the-earth movement of the early and mid-1970s,
underground homes became popular. Those now have been replaced by
elaborate designs more reflective of the 1980s: prosperity,
sophistication and self-indulgence, Mrs. Hennin said.
   Jim and Roxie Westbrook of Santa Cruz, Calif., are building a
passive-solar country house on the outskirts of the nearby Henry
Cowell Redwoods State Park, complete with a hot tub and more gadgets
and fixtures than they had in the older homes they owned.
   ``There's nothing cheap in it,'' Mrs. Westbrook said in a
telephone interview. ``When it's a choice between quality and going
for quality, we go for quality.''
   Others prefer a home that is unadorned. Miers and his wife left
Pennsylvania with the romantic notion of building a home that
embraced their 1960s values _ the desire to be independent,
energy-efficient and frugal.
   But despite changing tastes, Mrs. Hennin says most people are
joined by a creative urge and a determination to take control of
their lives.
   ``It's a grabbing of life, rather than letting life roll you
over,'' she said. ``If houses cost so much, it's your responsibility
to figure out a way for them not to cost so much.''

<HEAD>Meshach Taylor Left Political Reporting for Acting</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meshach Taylor might never have become an
actor, or found his way onto CBS's ``Designing Women,'' if he hadn't
gotten bored as a political reporter.
   Taylor co-stars on the hit comedy show as Anthony Bouvier, the
only regular man among the four beautiful women.
   He started acting in community shows in New Orleans, where his
father was dean of students at Dillard University. He continued
doing roles in Indianapolis after his father moved to Indiana
University as dean of the college of arts and sciences.
   An early marriage while attending Florida A&amp;M University forced
Taylor to look for work. Later, when his first daughter was born, he
moved back to Indianapolis.
   ``I got a flunky job on an FM station,'' he said. ``They had no
news at night, so I figured I could do a three-minute news report. I
was the only black person at the station so they let me do it. I
became a `rip and reader.' It expanded to five minutes.
   ``Pretty soon I was working days. I was on the political beat
with experienced reporters. Then I became the State House reporter.
It was interesting for a while. But once you get involved in Indiana
politics you see what a yawn it is.''
   After that, he set up a black arts theater to keep kids off the
street, then joined the national touring company of ``Hair.'' His
acting career was launched. After ``Hair'' he became a part of the
burgeoning theater world in Chicago and stayed for eight years,
until 1979.
   Taylor played the assistant director in ``Buffalo Bill,'' the
short-lived NBC show in 1983-84 about an unbelievably arrogant and
self-centered talk show host played by Dabney Coleman.
   He did guest star roles on such shows as ``Lou Grant,'' ``The
White Shadow'' and ``M-A-S-H.'' It seemed that his role on
``Designing Women'' would also be a one-shot for producer Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason.
   ``It was for the Thanksgiving show, about half-way through the
first season,'' Taylor said. ``Linda said if the character goes I'd
be back. I was off the next week, then I went back the next week and
I've been there ever since. My first show I was just an ex-con on a
work-release program.''
   Sometimes real life works its way into the shows.
   ``We were doing some promotional work in Lubbock, Texas, and
somehow Delta Burke and I got booked into the same hotel suite,'' he
said. ``I said I was a married man. So, I called my wife and she
called her boyfriend, Gerald McRaney. When we got back I told Linda
and she put it into a show. We got stranded at a motel during a
blizzard and ended up in the same bed. Another time, I had to help
Delta get dressed.''
   Taylor's role on ``Designing Women'' has grown, as Anthony has
grown into a more responsible person. He's now studying and will
soon have his college degree.
   ``The role's gotten more substantial, both in the amount of work
and in the depth of what Anthony says,'' said Taylor. ``He's not
just the wisecracker.''
   Taylor said he was much too young when he got married in college.
``I never considered I'd have to get a job,'' he said. ``What kind
of a job can a black man without a college education get in
Tallahassee? I got a job in a crate factory on the night shift,
making $1.35 an hour. There were no safety precautions.
   ``It was a nightmare. The people who ran the place couldn't
handle that I was working and going to college. That was too much
ambition for a black man. My next job was a bellman at a hotel.
Everyone else was a bellboy, but since I was in college I was a
bellman. That was a good job.''
   Taylor also has been in such movies as ``A Wedding,'' ``Stoney
Island,'' ``Damien: Omen Two,'' ``Another Saturday Night,'' ``House
of Games'' and ``Mannequin.''
   A sequel to ``Mannequin,'' a comedy remake of ``One Touch of
Venus,'' is in the works. Playwright David Mamet, a friend from his
Chicago theater days, wrote ``House of Games'' and has a new movie
script called ``Cops and Robbers.''
   Taylor lives in Los Angeles with his second wife and three
daughters, one from his first marriage.

<HEAD>Former KKK Chief Makes Strong Showing In Legislative Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AUSTIN WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>METAIRIE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stately mansions of Northline Drive and
the refurbished fishing camps of Bucktown have things in common: a
fear of crime, a loathing for property taxes _ and David Duke
campaign signs on the lawns.
   Duke, 38, formerly Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and now
head of the National Association for the Advancement of White
People, led a seven-candidate field on Jan. 21 in the first primary
election for a state Legislature seat.
   The district made up of ``Old Metairie'' is flanked on one side
by an exclusive country club and the million-dollar mansions of
Northline Drive and on the other by what was a fishing village
before urban sprawl. In between are neighborhoods of
turn-of-the-century wood frame homes and 1960s ranch-style dwellings.
   The electorate is a mix of affluence, blue-collar workers and
young professionals moving to the quiet suburb in search of better
schools and a safer environment, and 99.6 percent of them are white.
   Duke polled 33 percent of the vote. Runner-up John Treen had 19
percent. Treen, 62, is the brother of Dave Treen, who served from
1980-1984 as the state's only Republican governor since
Reconstruction.
   The first-primary victory ``sends notice that the political wind
is changing in this country and that the great American middle class
is going to speak up for its interest,'' Duke said.
   The runoff is set for Feb. 18, and his showing has Louisiana
residents abuzz. Gov. Buddy Roemer said it would be a blot on the
state's image if Duke managed to win the election. The New
York-based Jewish Defense Organization says a team of disrupters is
headed to Louisiana to prevent that.
   Duke left the Klan eight years ago after being accused of selling
secret Klan membership rolls. The alleged transaction was revealed
by Bill Wilkerson, Imperial Wizard of another, fiercely jealous,
Klan faction.
   Duke today disavows violence and denies he's a racist. His
platform includes three major planks: no alteration of the state's
homestead exemption, which exempts from property taxes any home
worth $75,000 or less; abolition of minority set-asides; and welfare
reform to discourage illegitimate births.
   Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee said there might be racial
overtones to a platform that should not be described as overtly
racist. ``I do not want the message to go out that the vote in my
parish was for a racist. The fact is that there are some social and
economic issues that may have created a backlash.
   ``He's talking economic issues and social issues that 80 percent
of the voters in this parish respond to.''
   Lee said he was similarly misinterpreted three years ago when he
instructed a roving task force of deputies to stop and question
blacks found cruising the all-white neighborhoods at night. He
rescinded the order, but said that ``for the next several weeks, 96
percent of the mail I received was favorable.''
   More recently, the Jefferson Parish Council erected a barricade
across a street linking a predominantly black New Orleans
neighborhood to a predominantly white neighborhood in Jefferson
Parish.
   New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy ordered the barricade torn
down, and Jefferson Parish officials let it stay down.
   There were 25 murders in the first 23 days of this year in New
Orleans. A band of young blacks chanting ``No Whites on Canal
Street'' assaulted whites on the street after a Martin Luther King
Day parade just days before the election.
   Duke insists his campaign is free of racism. ``I believe in equal
rights for all people. I truly believe in it. I refer to myself as a
civil rights activist dedicated to everyone's civil rights.''
   During his Klan years, which began when he was a student at John
F. Kennedy High School here, Duke was interviewed by Tom Snyder and
Barbara Walters among hundreds of other reporters. Almost
unanimously, interviewers came away with the uneasy feeling Duke
was, at least, unsettling. One background check disclosed a score of
173 on an IQ test, putting him in the genius category.
   Duke appeared on more than 200 talk shows in at least nine
countries during the late 1970s and spoke at more than a hundred
colleges for up to $1,200. The appearances were marked by his calm,
detached rational delivery of extreme beliefs.
   He honed his declamatory skills at Free Speech Alley, a student
forum at Louisiana State University, and peppers his conversations
with quotations from William Shakespeare, Benjamin Franklin, Martin
Luther and others.
   Duke has been arrested at least twice, once in Jefferson Parish
on charges of inciting a riot in 1978 and once two years ago for
blocking a highway and reckless conduct during a demonstration in
Forsyth County, Ga. He was sentenced to six months on the Jefferson
Parish charge and fined $55 in Georgia, with a 12-month sentence
suspended on a promise to stay out of the state for a year.
   Earlier, he led Scotland Yard on a chase across England while
appearing on television shows, scheduling interviews and holding
cross burnings. The police wanted to oust him as an undesirable, but
they couldn't catch him.
   He vowed to run for president in 1979, but didn't. He ran last
year and got on the ballot in several states even though he was
denied official recognition by the national Democratic Party. He
polled 18,612 votes in his home state, compared to 1.5 million for
George Bush and Michael Dukakis.
   Before last week's primary, his best race was in 1976 for a
vacant seat in the Louisiana Senate. He polled 11,000 votes, a third
of those cast. He had 3,995 votes last week. Treen, who ran with the
endorsement of the parish Republican organization, polled 2,277
votes.
   ``The Klan is far behind me,'' Duke said, ``but the effort for
equal rights for everybody is ahead of me.''

<HEAD>Questions and Answers About Court's Affirmative Action Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advocates and opponents of racial quotas to
remedy bias agree that a new Supreme Court decision in a Richmond,
Va., case will affect significantly the future of affirmative action.
   Here, in question-and-answer form, is a look at the court's
decision and likely impact.
   Q: What did the court do?
   A: The justices, by a 6-3 vote, struck down a five-year program
adopted by the Richmond, Va., City Council that required white-owned
companies bidding on any city contract to set aside 30 percent of
the contract's value for minority-owned subcontractors.
   Q: Why was the program invalidated?
   A: Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said
Richmond's plan was based on a general claim of racial bias in the
construction industry. She said there was no proof _ statistical or
otherwise _ to back up that assertion.
   The decision said rigid racial quotas must be supported by
evidence, for example, that black-owned enterprises tried to obtain
construction contracts but were denied them.
   Without such evidence, the use of racial quotas violate the
equal-protection rights of whites.
   Q: Why was the opinion so bitterly denounced by the court's three
most liberal members, led by its only black, Justice Thurgood
Marshall?
   A: Marshall said the court adopted a sweeping standard that could
doom a whole range of affirmative action programs. He called the
ruling ``a giant step backward'' for the court's long-standing
commitment to racial equality.
   Q: What standard did the court adopt?
   A: For the first time in more than a decade of deciding
affirmative action disputes, the court said racial preferences
adopted by governmental agencies must be given ``strict scrutiny.''
   That standard _ previously applied only to minorities' claims
that they are victims of discrimination _ means that plans to
benefit blacks, Hispanics and other such groups automatically will
be suspect.
   A state or local government program giving preferences to
minorities will be struck down unless there is a ``compelling
governmental interest'' to justify it and the program is ``narrowly
tailored'' to remedy the identified abuse. In practice, strict
scrutiny generally dooms a government's initiative.
   Q: How common are so-called set-asides like the one Richmond
adopted?
   A: Thirty-six states and 190 cities earmark public funds in this
fashion for minorities.
   Q: Are federal programs affected?
   A: The court specifically exempted set-asides approved by federal
law. The court said Congress has unique power under the Constitution
to enact such programs.
   In 1980, the justices upheld a law that earmarked 10 percent of
federally funded public works contracts to minority groups.
   Q: Does the decision affect affirmative action programs beyond
set-asides?
   A: The ruling did not deal with affirmative action quotas for
hiring and promotions. But civil rights groups expressed concern the
ruling will discourage states and cities from beginning or expanding
all plans to help minorities.
   Q: Does the ruling affect private businesses?
   A: It only applies directly to actions by state and local
government. The ruling was based on equal-protection guarantees in
the Constitution aimed at protecting against government abuses, not
those by private citizens.
   Q: Does the ruling mean the court is becoming more conservative
on affirmative action?
   A: Former President Reagan's three appointees to the court plus
William H. Rehnquist _ promoted to chief justice by Reagan _ joined
non-Reagan appointees Justices Byron R. White and John Paul Stevens
in striking down the Richmond plan.
   Stevens is always unpredictable, but the other five appear to be
forging a more reliable conservative consensus.
   Of particular note is the presence of the court's newest member,
Anthony M. Kennedy, in the majority. Kennedy replaced retired
Justice Lewis F. Powell, a moderate conservative whose vote often
was decisive on affirmative action.
   Q: What has the court said in the past about affirmative action?
   A: With many twists and turns and splintered voting, the court
generally has upheld the principle of affirmative action.
   Its decisions date back to 1978 when it said educational programs
may give preferential treatment to racial minorities and women to
make up for past discrimination. At the same time, the court struck
down a rigid racial quota that denied Allan Bakke, a white man,
admission to a California medical school.
   More recent decisions have: forced a union to double its
non-white membership; upheld a federal court consent decree
reserving half the promotions in a city fire department for
qualified minority candidates; and upheld a court-ordered plan
requiring promotion of equal numbers of black and white state police
troopers.
   The court also has said a public employer may give preference to
a woman marginally less qualified than a man applying for the same
job.
   Q: Could there be a silver lining for minorities in the Richmond
case?
   A: Some civil rights activists say the ruling gives state and
local officials _ with the political will to act _ a road map for
adopting a constitutional affirmative action plan. This ``new-found
clarity'' means that carefully drawn plans will be acceptable, they
say.
   They also applauded the court's rejection of a more restrictive
approach _ one that would have limited preferential treatment to
only those individuals who could prove they were victims of past
discrimination.

   A new age of harmony in foreign policy is going
to be elusive and fragile, even with the Republican White House and
the Senate's top Democrat working to create it.
   It will take more than bipartisanship because the most divisive
and intractable policy disputes of the era were not partisan in the
first place. They hinged instead on the powers of Congress and the
Executive Branch to make or risk war in a time of limited conflicts,
surgical strikes, terrorism and, most recently, naval escort
missions for reflagged Kuwaiti ships in the Persian Gulf.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said defense is a
responsibility shared by the president and Congress ``but in recent
years it sometimes seemed as if we were opposing each other rather
than exercising shared powers. That need not be.''
   His words meshed with President's Bush's inaugural call for a new
era of cooperation and unity.
   The challenge is to define the shared powers so as to satisfy
Congress without intruding on authority presidents always have
reserved as their own.
   Mitchell said bipartisanship ``cannot be made real by words
alone, or by good intentions.
   ``It requires deeds to match words, action to carry out intention
... shared responsibility.''
   The new majority leader asked Bush to make Congress ``a partner
in policy formulation,'' acknowledging that even that won't prevent
differences between the two branches of government. ``But in the
great eras of American leadership, the differences have been less
important than the agreements,'' Mitchell said.
   A generation ago, a Democratic administration and an
overwhelmingly Democratic Congress clashed in the dispute that gave
rise to the rest _ the undeclared war in Vietnam.
   ``That war cleaves us still,'' Bush said in his inaugural
address. ``But friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a
century ago and surely the statute of limitations has been
reached...''
   Five years after that divisive war drove President Lyndon B.
Johnson into retirement, Congress sought to assert its authority
with the war powers resolution, sponsored by a liberal Republican
senator, vetoed by a Republican president, overridden by a
Democratic Congress. It says that presidents can't sent U.S. forces
into potential war zones for more than 90 days unless Congress
approves.
   That remains on the books, never fully invoked but often debated.
The issue is power, not partisanship. Presidents inevitably guard
what they deem to be the prerogatives of a commander in chief.
   Since the war powers resolution was adopted in 1973 over the veto
of Richard M. Nixon, two more Republican presidents and one Democrat
have argued as he did that it is unconstitutional and can undermine
U.S. action in time of crisis.
   The war powers resolution requires that the president notify
Congress within 48 hours whenever he sends combat-ready troops
overseas. When they are sent into conflict or ``situations where
imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated,'' they
must be withdrawn within 60 days unless Congress votes to keep them
there, 90 days if the president certifies in writing that the extra
time is vital to safe withdrawal.
   That law never has been fully invoked, although often debated.
Critics of President Reagan's escort policy in the Persian Gulf
tried seven times to get congressional action that would have
compelled the administration to invoke the act. Then they went to
court and lost there, too. The administration insisted war powers
didn't apply, even after 37 sailors were killed when an Iraqi
missile hit the U.S.S. Stark.
   Only Congress has the power to declare war. But that hasn't
happened since the United States entered World War II the day after
Pearl Harbor. Korea and Vietnam were undeclared wars. Situations
like those in Lebanon, Grenada, the attack on Libya defy even that
description.
   ``...We find that we are drawn into smaller conflicts where the
lines between active hostilities and uneasy truce are unclear,''
Mitchell said. ``That was the case in the Persian Gulf last year. It
will be the case in other places in the future.
   ``Our system should ensure that when force is necessary, it is
used surely and for goals clear to all of us,'' he said.
   Mitchell said that was the idea behind the war powers resolution,
but that it has become a point of contention and stalemate. Leaders
of both parties want it revised, probably eliminating the withdrawal
deadlines in favor of regular White House consultation with a
designated panel of Congressional leaders on national security
policy.

   President Bush says he hopes the Federal
Reserve Board's concern about inflation won't lead the central bank
to stifle economic growth by driving up interest rates.
   Bush said Wednesday he believes the economy is ``reasonably
stable,'' adding, ``There's no signals out there in the markets that
this economy is in real trouble.''
   The president's comments came one day after Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan told a House committee that the central bank

<HEAD>Milken Out at Drexel as Part of Plea Bargain; Won't Get Most of 1988
Pay</HEAD>

   Michael R. Milken, the embattled junk bond chief
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is being cut off from the firm _
without most of his pay _ according to the plea bargain Drexel
struck to settle the nation's largest securities fraud case.
   The bad news for Milken, considered the driving force behind
Drexel's leap from Wall Street obscurity, came in a 12-page plea
agreement signed by Drexel officials Tuesday and made public
Wednesday.
   Milken's attorney condemned the deal as ``punishment without
trial, sentence before verdict.''
   Drexel also agreed it would not pay Milken's brother, senior
company aide Lowell J. Milken, half of what is due him in 1988.
   Both Milkens were named along with Drexel in a Securities and
Exchange Commission insider trading civil lawsuit in September.
   Neither brother has been charged with any criminal activity and
both have denied wrongdoing. But Michael Milken is considered one of
the biggest remaining targets of the investigation and is expected
to be indicted soon on racketeering and fraud charges.
   Milken heads Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.-based high yield
``junk'' bond department and is one of the most dynamic financiers
of the decade. Said to be one of the country's wealthiest people,
Milken reportedly makes $200 million a year, mostly in a yearly
bonus paid in the following year.
   Denying him most of his 1988 money not only would seriously crimp
Milken's legal-defense war chest but would go a long way toward
defraying the cost of Drexel's own settlement of criminal charges.
   The agreement also required Drexel to pay $500 million of the
$650 million penalty on the day it enters a guilty plea, a date
which U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said will not be set until
after the SEC approves the settlement.
   A Drexel lawyer said that approval may be worked out by early
next week, according to a court transcript unsealed Wednesday.
   ``We are meeting with them almost on daily basis eight or nine
hours a day,'' Drexel lawyer Thomas F. Curnin told U.S. District
Judge Kimba Wood Tuesday.
   ``And we may well have an agreement with the SEC, particularly if
we work through the weekend, by next Monday or Tuesday,'' he added,
according to the transcript.
   Drexel also must pay 8.5 percent interest on the initial $500
million up until the day it enters a guilty plea.
   ``There is no change in Mr. Milken's position, and his attorneys
are continuing to prepare to defend him against any charges that may
be brought,'' said defense lawyer Martin Flumenbaum, adding that the
agreement's provisions requiring Drexel to fire Milken ``and to
refuse to pay him the compensation for his service due in 1988 is a
violation of due process and an infringement of Mr. Milken's
constitutional rights.''
   ``Drexel chief executive Fred Joseph has consistently maintained
he has no indication Lowell Milken did anything wrong,'' said
defense lawyer, Michael Armstrong.
   He added: ``Drexel has been forced to punish some one it has
characterized as blameless in order to avoid being put out of
business by a ruinous (racketeering) indictment.''
   Drexel, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, agreed to
plead guilty to six felony charges and pay a record $650 million in
fines and restitution. The specific counts, revealed by federal
prosecutors Tuesday, included allegations of illegal dealings with
disgraced stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and the defunct securities
firm, Princeton-Newport Partners.
   The plea bargain agreement ``does not provide any protection
whatsoever from criminal prosecution or civil liability to any
individual or to entity other than Drexel,'' it said in part.
   The agreement called for Drexel to pay $300 million in criminal
fines and civil penalties. The remaining $350 million will be placed
in an escrow account that ``will be used to compensate civil
claimants'' who may sue over losses sustained by Drexel's actions.
   Under the plea bargain, Drexel also agreed to put any indicted
employee on a leave of absence and fire them if they are convicted.
So far, no current Drexel employee has been indicted in the two-year
probe.
   Drexel is one of the most profitable investment concerns in the
country. It is a leader in the $175 billion market for ``junk bond''
securities, often used to finance takeovers and the growth of small-
to medium-sized companies.

   Michael Milken was the engine that
propelled Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. up through the ranks of the
securities business, but the junk bond trader may have become excess
baggage.
   Drexel revealed Wednesday it will fire Milken as part of a record
$650 million plea bargain with federal prosecutors who charged the
Wall Street firm with securities fraud.
   The junk bond market Milken nurtured through a decade is crucial
to Drexel's profitability, but it was unclear how Milken's departure
would affect the firm's role in the market.
   And in one very real sense, jettisoning the chief of the Beverly
Hills-based division Drexel refers to as the high-yield bond unit
helps the firm out of its present straits: The plea agreement calls
for the firm to withhold Milken's 1988 salary and bonuses, which, at
an estimated $200 million, is enough to pay a sizeable chunk of the
fine.
   The Los Angeles-born trader is widely credited with
single-handedly persuading investors that there was gold in
high-yield, high-risk bonds issued by companies too small or too
weak to earn the endorsement of bond-rating firms. He preached the
idea that a junk bond investor could earn high interest and protect
himself from potential default of one company by holding a portfolio
of bonds in a number of companies.
   Drexel made millions as the dominant firm in the junk bond
market, which has funded corporate raiders and struggling
entrepreneurs alike.
   Milken, who got the firm to allow him to set up shop in
California, was said to control a network of investors. Often, a
businessman who had financed his dreams by selling junk bonds became
a ready buyer for another company's bonds when pitched by Milken.
   But there are indications his role as the indispensable engine of
the junk bond market _ and so his value to Drexel _ has diminished.
   By some accounts, Milken has spent little time in his Beverly
Hills office during the two years it was publicly known Drexel was a
target of federal fraud investigations.
   Yet despite inroads made by other firms, Drexel has remained the
acknowledged leader in the junk bond market.

<HEAD>Boeing's Schedule For New 747 May Have Been Too Ambitious, Exec Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENTON, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. may have been too ambitious
in its schedule for introducing its new 747-400 jumbo jet, a top
Boeing Commercial Airplanes executive says.
   ``The expression that `hindsight is perfect' applies. You can
always look back and see things you could do better,'' Phil Condit,
the Boeing division's executive vice president for engineering and
production, said Wednesday in an interview.
   Boeing had hoped to get the first of the new planes to customers
by late last year. But a series of glitches has delayed the delivery
schedule three times, and increasingly impatient customers still
haven't got the initial planes.
   In bringing out the 747-400, the world's largest commercial
jetliner, Boeing, in effect, was introducing four aircraft models
simultaneously, Condit said. Some 21 operators have ordered 166 of
the new planes, which will be capable of carrying 412 passengers
more than 8,000 miles nonstop.
   The plane can be ordered with one of three different types of
engines, and in a combination freight-passenger configuration. Each
variation had to be certified with the Federal Avation
Administration. In addition, Condit said, each of the customers
signed up for the planes wants the jets customized.
   ``That's a big, complex task,'' Condit said. ``If I had it to do
over again, I would have spread some of that out.''
   Condit is meeting with groups of reporters this week to answer
questions about Boeing production delays and recent troubles that
have plagued Boeing aircraft.
   Among incidents in recent weeks, an older Eastern 737 made an
unscheduled landing after losing cabin pressure from a fuselage
hole; a new British Midlands 737-400 crashed in Great Britain after
one engine failed and another was shut off; an engine fell off a
Piedmont 737-200, which landed safely in Chicago; and a wing panel
came off an Eastern 757.
   In addition, the FAA ordered checks for possible cross-wiring in
cargo hold fire extinguishers on 757s and 767s. Eight instances of
cross-wiring were found on 757s, the latest last week on a plane
owned by the Mexican government, but none have been found so far on
the 767 widebodies.
   Boeing said Tuesday that inspections had been completed on 98
percent of the world's fleet of 479 737-300s and 16 737-400s, and no
wiring problems had been found. The checks were ordered as a
precaution after it was speculated that cross-wired engines might
have contributed to the British Midlands crash.
   ``What we have had is a set of very unrelated incidents. They
flat aren't connected at all, except by one thing and that's time,''
Condit said.
   In October, Boeing told its 747-400 customers that wiring
problems would delay deliveries of the first 20 or so jets, but the
schedule would be back on track early in 1989. A second delay
occurred in December, when it took longer than expected for the FAA
to certify the planes. Last week, Boeing again said it was
re-examining its delivery schedule, and would tell customers by the
end of January when to expect their planes.
   Condit refused to say what the revised schedule would be, or
whether some deliveries would be bumped from 1989 to 1990, saying
Boeing would be contacting its customers this week so they could
know first. Boeing's annual earnings report will be out Monday, and
it will contain an estimate of 1989 aircraft delivery levels, he
said.
   Boeing last week also completed a five-day ``readjustment'' of
Boeing's 747-400 line, to catch up work and get it back in sequence.
Condit said a similar three-day readjustment took place in October,
and in December, some employees worked on the plane through their
Christmas break.
   ``We've started out on a new, very large, complex program,''
Condit said. ``While you'd like every program to go perfectly, when
you do big programs they don't all go perfectly. We've had some part
shortages, we have some work that got out of sequence.''
   Asked whether Boeing's credibility was hurt by its troubles,
Condit said no.
   ``The airlines themselves understand the process. The
fundamentals of this business is, one, it's very visible, and two,
whatever happens, you set out to go fix it. I think that's Boeing's
record ... When you have a problem, go fix it.''

   Darby Williams can play violin, piano,
marimba, cello _ you name it. Composes a pretty good song, too. Not
bad for someone who can barely put one note in front of the other.
   Williams is president of Breakaway Music Systems of San Mateo,
Calif., manufacturer of a new product dubbed the Vocalizer 1000, a
real break for the tone deaf.
   If you can hum, you play the Vocalizer. You don't even have to
hum very well.
   ``I had a terrible time trying to play the clarinet when I was
young,'' said Williams, 35. ``I wasn't much better at the guitar.''
   The Vocalizer, which sells for $300, is capable of producing
music from 28 preset lead instruments, plus five drum sounds. All
the owner needs to do is plug it into a stereo and add the voice.
   It may sound like a high-tech kazoo, but the Vocalizer is far
more sophisticated than that, Williams said.
   ``It was initially designed for the amateur musician but now the
professionals are buying it,'' he said after a recent demonstration
to a potential buyer who couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. ``It's a
home studio to them because it has a mid-in and out that lets them
hook up their synthesizers.''
   The unit also operates on batteries so there's no getting away
from the moment of inspiration.
   The would-be customer picked up the microphone and hummed some
Cole Porter and Chopin. ``The Grand Polonaise'' sounded a bit
different played on a steel drum instead of a piano. ``Night and
Day'' didn't sound as good, but it was evident a little practice
would help.
   ``The better you get, the more you can do,'' said Williams.
   The technology was developed by Marcian Hoff, inventor of the
microprocessor. Williams met him when the two worked at the video
game concern Atari Corp. in 1984.
   Last year the two obtained a patent for Voice Guide, the process
that lets the voice trigger notes that will be in tune with the
background instruments.
   The black-colored unit was designed by Frogdesign Harmut
Esslinger Inc. of Campbell, Calif., which designed Apple's Macintosh
computer.
   Breakaway started selling the Vocalizer in the upscale Sharper
Image catalog in November and since then has ``sold thousands on
thousands of them,'' said Williams, who added he couldn't be more
specific because of company policy.
   Williams has hired six other people and expects revenues to be in
the ``tens of millions'' by Christmas, he said.

   The dollar was little changed in light European

short a modest rally, had temporarily confused the market.
   ``Even though there's still commercial demand for dollars, taking
on the central banks doesn't seem like a very good idea right now,''
said a trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.13 Japanese yen to a closing 127.52 yen. Later, in
London, it rose back up to 128.00 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.8435 West German marks, unchanged; 1.5680 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5670; 6.2755 French francs, up from 6.2715; 2.0820
Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,348.75 Italian lire, down from
1,350.50; 1.1834 Canadian, down from 1.1840.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7730 from $1.7710 late
Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $406.25 a troy ounce, up
from $404.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $406.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $406.10, up from $404.25 bid
late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.13 to close at a bid $407.70.
Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $6.20 a troy ounce,
up from $6.12 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Dollar Off Slightly, Tokyo Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar declined slightly today against the
Japanese yen, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index fell back
from its record high of the previous day.
   Dealers said the foreign exchange and stock markets both were
affected by Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita's comment
Wednesday that the central bank might take early action, if
necessary, to curb inflation in Japan. This was taken as a hint of
higher interest rates.
   The dollar closed at 127.52 yen, down 0.13 yen from Wednesday's
close of 127.65 yen. After opening at 127.37, it stayed in a narrow
range between 127.30 yen and 127.60 yen in relatively quiet trading.
   ``Gov. Sumita's comment and (the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's)
intervention (to check the dollar's rise) discouraged players from
actively buying the dollar,'' said a dealer at a major bank in
Tokyo. ``Players were also worried about intervention by the Bank of
Japan.''
   Higher interest rates in Japan would make the yen more attractive
to investors.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues lost 55.98 points, or 0.18 percent, closing at 31,511.81,
following a record high close of 31,567.79 on Wednesday.
   Securities dealers said a bearish mood persisted in the stock
market throughout the day because of investors' fears of an interest
rate hike.
   ``Trading was slow and not many shares were moving actively on
the trading board today except automobile shares,'' said a dealer at
Nikko Securities Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Profit-taking activities were also notable today. That probably
pushed most shares down.''
   He added, ``The market only took a brief relief today, but I
think the market environment is still favorable for most stocks.''

<HEAD>Artificial Relief for Budget Deficit in December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A temporary shift in the payment of Social
Security benefits held last month's budget deficit to less than half
the level of a year earlier but economists still expect the
shortfall for fiscal 1989 to exceed last year's level.
   December's deficit was $11.6 billion, down from $24.4 billion in
the same month a year earlier, the Treasury Department reported
Wednesday. For the first three months of fiscal 1989, which began
Oct. 1, the budget gap was $67.7 billion, down 17.8 percent from the
same period a year earlier.
   Michael K. Evans, an economic consultant in Washington,
attributed the improvement to an ``end of the year fluke'' in which
Social Security checks that normally would have been mailed out in
January 1988 went out at the end of the previous month, artificially
inflating the deficit for December 1987.
   The fiscal 1989 deficit actually is running about as expected,
and should exceed last year's $155 billion shortfall by about $10
billion, Evans said.
   While the deficit is expected to continue to grow in fiscal 1989,
with President Bush unlikely to tame it, the shortfall shouldn't
hinder economic growth, Evans said.
   ``It's just not going to affect the economy,'' he said. ``I don't
see this as a disaster.''
   The Reagan administration, in its final budget proposal this
month, projected a $161.5 billion deficit for fiscal 1989. The
Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, forecasts a $141 billion
shortfall.
   Bush plans to detail his administration's priorities in an
address to Congress on Feb. 9 and to unveil his budget proposals
shortly thereafter.
   Economists are forecasting slower growth in the second half of
1989, and rising interest rates early in the year, both of which
hinder efforts to reduce the deficit. Weak growth slows tax
collections, while higher interest rates force the government to
spend more to finance the $2.7 trillion national debt.
   As usual, the largest spending categories in December were the
military, Social Security, other programs in the Department of
Health and Human Services, interest on the national debt and farm
subsidies.
   Military spending totaled $28.2 billion last month and $77.3
billion for the past three months, up 4 percent from the same period
a year earlier.
   Interest on the national debt totaled $35 billion in December and
$68.3 billion for the first three months of the fiscal year, up 11.7
percent from a year earlier.
   Spending for Social Security was $18.8 billion during December
and $54.6 billion for the first three months of fiscal 1989, down
20.9 percent from a year earlier because of the shift in payment
dates.
   Other HHS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, cost $14.7
billion in December and $40 billion so far in the fiscal year, up 6
percent from the same period in fiscal 1988.
   Spending by the Agriculture Department totaled $4.9 billion in
December and $16 billion for the first three months of fiscal 1989,
down 3.9 percent from the previous year.

<HEAD>Skinner Headed for Confirmation as Transportation Secretary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Samuel K. Skinner, one of the few Washington
outsiders named to President Bush's Cabinet, is headed toward
confirmation as transportation secretary after squelching a lone
objection to his nomination.
   The former U.S. attorney, who is an active pilot and administers
the nation's second-largest mass transit system, testified for 2{
hours Wednesday before the Senate Commerce Committee. The Chicago
resident pledged support for mandatory drug testing, a battle
against air terrorists and promotion of competition in the nation's
air, sea and land transportation.
   Committee chairman Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said he was
keeping the hearing record open until noon today for further comment
but said he expected approval when the committee meets to vote on
the nomination next Tuesday. A full Senate vote would follow.
   ``I don't think you'll have any trouble next Tuesday morning,''
Hollings told Skinner, 50, at the end of the hearing. ``You've done
a superb job. You're a breath of fresh air.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, had tried to delay the
confirmation hearing over questions about Skinner's actions as a
U.S. attorney in Chicago in 1977, but withdrew his objection after
speaking with Skinner.
   In his testimony, Skinner said he would fight for fairness for
U.S. airlines abroad even if it put him at odds with the State
Department.
   ``I think we've got a right to compete in the world on an equal
basis,'' he said, when asked about the difficulty encountered by
U.S. airlines seeking access to some airports abroad, including
Tokyo, even after diplomatic agreements are concluded.
   ``I'm not going to take a back seat,'' Skinner said.
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., applauded Skinner's intention not to
take orders from the State Department, saying, ``Don't let them
shove you around.''
   ``It may be a little naive, but that's the position we're going
to take,'' said Skinner, although he also called himself ``a team
player'' and said he would work with Secretary of State-designate
James Baker.
   Skinner said he supports random drug tests for transportation
workers, pledged to battle drunken driving, promised to help build
up the Coast Guard and the maritime industry, and announced he would
draw up a long-range national transportation policy.
   Several committee members urged that the government continue to
subsidize air service to small airports that deregulated carriers
otherwise might abandon. Skinner pledged to work with Congress and
said it would be foolish for the Transportation Department to end
the service and then be forced to restore it.
   No committee member raised an objection to the nomination or
strongly questioned any of Skinner's statements.
   Metzenbaum had questioned Skinner's failure as a prosecutor in
1977 to prosecute G.D. Searle Co. on allegations that it falsified
test results on its Nutrasweet artificial sweetener.
   Skinner told the senators the decision not to prosecute was made
by his successor. He acknowledged some minor mistakes as he left
office and joined the law firm that represented Searle, but said he
had nothing to do with the Searle case as a private lawyer.
   Metzenbaum said he was satisfied with the explanation and that he
would vote for Skinner's confirmation.

<HEAD>Soviets May Buy Record Grain This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has given the go-ahead to the
Soviet Union for buying more U.S. grain this year, including
subsidized wheat, raising the possibility that total sales might
exceed the record level of four years ago.
   Agriculture Department officials said Wednesday the Soviets have
been cleared to buy up to 20 million metric tons of grain in
1988-89, up from the 16 million tons specified earlier. Purchases
already total more than 12 million tons.
   The department also said the Soviets have bought an additional
150,000 tons of soybean meal, which has a potential current market
value of about $36 million.
   Under a long-term grain agreement, the Soviet Union was
originally limited to 12 million tons of U.S. grain a year without
further consultations with Washington, but that was increased to 16
million tons on Dec. 23. The agreement had expired last Sept. 30 but
was later extended.
   Officials said the increase for 1988-89 ``takes into account
recent public confirmation by Soviet authorities'' that the Soviet
Union's grain harvest last year was below expectations.
   In a related development, Acting Undersecretary Richard W.
Goldberg announced that Moscow has been authorized an additional 2
million tons of wheat that it can buy under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Earlier this week, for example, the department announced an EEP
wheat sale to the Soviet Union of 635,000 tons, or about 23.3
million bushels. The subsidies shaved $23.05 per ton off the regular
market price, or about 63 cents per bushel.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Only wheat is approved for sale to the Soviet Union under the EEP
subsidy arrangement.
   Sales of wheat and corn now total more than 11.6 million tons for
delivery in the long-term agreement's sixth year, which began last
Oct. 1.
   That comprises about 10.2 million tons of corn and 1.4 million
tons of wheat. In addition, the Soviets have bought 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.28 million tons of soybean meal, and 500,000 tons of
grain sorghums.
   Under the agreement, each ton of soybeans or meal counts for two
tons of grain.
   If Moscow buys the full 20 million tons of U.S. grain now
authorized, it would exceed the record level of 18.6 million tons of
1984-85, most of which was corn.
   The current agreement was a 5-year pact that began on Oct. 1,
1983, and then extended last fall through 1990.
   Under the pact, the Soviet Union is committed to buy at least 9
million tons of grain each year, including a minimum of 4 million
tons each of wheat and corn. The remaining 1 million tons can be
wheat, corn, soybeans or soybean meal, or a combination of those
commodities.

   As part of their record $650 million plea bargain with federal
prosecutors, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. will fire ``junk'' bond
chief Michael R. Milken, court papers revealed. The agreement also
specifies that Drexel will not pay Milken any of his expected
multimillion-dollar compensation for 1988.
   Milken is considered one of the biggest remaining targets of the
investigation and is expected to be indicted soon on racketeering
and fraud charges.
   Drexel is one of the most profitable investment concerns in the
country. It is a leader in the $175 billion market for junk bonds,

   A federal grand jury reportedly convened in Chicago to probe
allegations of fraud in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the
Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchanges.
Defense attorneys who advised clients to pass up government deals in
exchange for cooperation complained of high-pressure tactics by the
government.
   The complaints came a day after 200 subpoenas were served on
prominent brokers, traders and firms in a sweeping escalation of
Operation Sourmash, the code name for the undercover investigation
conducted by FBI agents who posed as traders. The probe reportedly
centers on allegations that up to 100 brokers and traders cheated
customers out of millions of dollars via shady dealings on the
exchange floors.

<NOTE>JAPAN STOCK SCANDAL</NOTE>

   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said he would not be driven from
office by the stock-trading scandal that has forced three Cabinet
ministers to resign.
   Opposition leaders demanded Takeshita's removal after Ken Harada,
the Economic Planning Agency director, resigned Tuesday because of
links to the Recruit Co. conglomerate, the company at the heart of
the scandal.
   Earlier this month, Takeshita declared his new Cabinet free of
taint from the scandal, in which politicians and others were offered
advance shares in a Recruit subsidiary and made huge profits when
the stock went public.
   Although the transactions were not illegal, the deal aroused
suspicions of bribery and influence-peddling and led to a public
outcry over fund-raising practices and the traditional coziness
between Japanese businessmen and politicians.

<HEAD>Discovery Aids Search for Superconductivity Explanation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Superconducting materials can carry current by
two mechanisms, rather than one as some theories hold, says a study
published today.
   The findings should help scientists figure out how
superconductivity works, researchers said.
   Superconductivity is the ability to carry electrical current
without resistance. Scientists are trying to develop new
superconductors that could be used in such applications as smaller
and faster computers and floating high-speed trains.
   But they still do not know just how superconductivity arises in
so-called ``high-temperature'' superconductors, which require less
chilling than previous materials before they lose resistance.
   University of Tokyo researchers report in today's issue of the
British journal Nature that they developed a new family of compounds
in which the current is carried by electrons, which are tiny charged
particles.
   In previously known high-temperature superconductors, the charge
was carried instead by roving areas called ``holes'' that lack
electrons, they said.
   Electricity is a flow of electrons. The idea of current being
carried by ``holes'' can be visualized if one imagines a row of cars
parked along a curb, with an empty parking space at the head.
   If the lead car moves up to fill that space, then the second car
moves up to take the first car's spot, and so on until all the cars
have moved, one could say all the cars moved ahead because an empty
parking space, or a hole, moved in the opposite direction.
   Proposed explanations of superconductivity have disagreed over
whether holes were the only possible carriers of current, said
Princeton University theorist Philip Anderson.
   The Japanese research casts doubt on widely accepted theories
that only holes can carry current, Anderson said in a telephone
interview.
   That will help physicists sort out the competing explanations for
superconductivity, said Northwestern University physicist Arthur
Freeman.
   Among the other theories are those that focus on a ``sea of
electrons'' within a material when it is not superconducting, with
the idea that those electrons are easily excited by an electric
field to carry a current, he said.
   The Japanese work will also permit new ways to test theories
about what causes superconductivity, physicist Victor Emery of the
Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., wrote in a Nature
editorial.
   The Japanese materials contain copper, oxygen and an element
called cerium, along with one of three other elements: praseodymium,
neodymium or samarium.

<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for ``big ticket'' durable
goods shot up 6.4 percent in December, the biggest increase in six
months, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted
$130.85 billion in December.
   The 6.4 percent jump was the biggest since an 8.7 percent
increase recorded last June. It reflected widespread demand in both
civilian and military categories.
   The December orders figure closed out the year on a strong note,
with orders for the last 12 months totaling $1.43 trillion, a 10.8
percent increase from 1987.
   It was the best showing since a 12.3 percent increase in 1984.
Orders had edged up a slight 1.2 percent in 1985 and 0.4 percent in
1986, two years in which American busineses were losing domestic and
overseas sales to foreign manufacturers.
   American manufacturing enjoyed a rebound in 1987 and 1988 as a
decline in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies made
U.S. products competitive once again on overseas markets.
   Orders in the volatile military category, influenced by when big
government contracts are signed, jumped 21.1 percent in December to
a seasonally adjusted $10.16 billion following a 21.5 percent
decrease in November.
   But even excluding defense, orders for durable goods were up 5.4
percent during the month.
   Orders for non-defense capital goods shot up as well, rising 7.8
percent to $38.6 billion last month. The category is closely watched
for signals of business intentions to expand and modernize.
   December's increase in demand for non-defense capital goods was
the biggest since a 12.5 percent jump in June.
   In another volatile category, transportation orders increased 20
percent in December to $38.9 billion after a 7.2 percent decrease a
month earlier.
   The strength in transportation included large gains in the auto,
aircraft and shipbuilding industries.
   Excluding transportation, the December increase in orders for
durable goods was 1.6 percent.
   In other industries, orders for primary metals rose 5.3 percent
to $13.3 billion, demand for electrical machinery was up 1.1 percent
to $20.3 billion, while orders for non-electrical machinery dropped
3.2 percent to $20.7 billion. Most of the decline in the
non-electrical category was in engines and turbines.
   Shipments of durable goods increased 3.8 percent to $124.46
billion in December, following a 1.2 percent increase in November.
   Shipments for the year totaled $1.39 trillion, up 9.9 percent
from 1987.

   Factory orders for ``big ticket'' durable goods jumped 6.4
percent in December, the biggest increase in six months, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted
$130.85 billion last month.
   The 6.4 percent rise was the largest since an 8.7 percent
increase recorded last June. It reflected widespread demand in both
civilian and military categories.
   The December figure closed out 1988 on a strong note, with orders
for the 12 months totaling $1.43 trillion, a 10.8 percent increase
from 1987 and the best showing since a 12.3 percent rise in 1984.
   President Bush, meanwhile, said Wednesday he thinks the economy
is ``reasonably stable'' and added, ``There's no signals out there
in the markets that this economy is in real trouble.''
   The president said he was concerned, however, that higher
interest rates could stifle economic growth.
   His remarks came a day after the Federal Reserve Board chairman,
Alan Greenspan, told a congressional panel the central bank is
likely to keep a tight grip on the money supply to control inflation.
   ``I haven't talked to Alan lately, but I don't want to see us
move so strongly against the fear of inflation that we impede
growth,'' Bush said.
   Reporting on the federal budget, the Treasury Department said
Wednesday that the deficit shrank to $11.6 billion for December,
less than half the level of a year earlier thanks to a shift in the
payment date for Social Security checks.
   The Treasury reported receiving $93.8 billion in revenues last
month, up 9.7 percent from the same period a year earlier. Spending,
meanwhile, was down 4.1 percent from December 1987 to $105.4 billion.
   The December 1987 deficit had been $24.4 billion.
   Also Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks reported
stronger economic activity in December and early January, fueled by
strength in retail sales and manufacturing.
   The report, based on surveys conducted by the banks, found little
change in other sectors of the economy. Demand for bank loans was
generally flat; construction work was subdued in most parts of the
country, and continuing dry weather threatened the winter wheat crop
in some areas.
   ``It would appear, on the basis of these reports, that the
national economy gained momentum in recent weeks as consumer
spending strengthened, manufacturing activity continued to rise and
producers scheduled more investment in plant and equipment,'' said
the report.
   And a real estate trade group said sales of existing
single-family homes last year hit their highest level since 1979 as
buyers shopped in lower price ranges rather than leave the market
when costs rose.
   The National Association of Realtors said 3.63 million homes were
sold in 1988, up 2.9 percent from 1987 when 3.53 million homes had
been sold. It was the highest sales volume since 3.83 million homes
were sold in 1979.

<HEAD>Hitachi Files Lawsuit in Patent Infringement Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle of the microprocessors is continuing,
this time with a federal patent infringement lawsuit filed by
Hitachi Ltd. against Motorola Inc. of Schaumburg.
   The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District court came a week
after a similar lawsuit filed by Motorola against Hitachi.
   The dispute centers on Motorola's 68HC11 and Hitachi's H-8
microprocessors, the digital electronic devices that perform the
control and arithmetic functions of televisions, watches,
videorecorders and other products.
   ``We want unspecified monetary damages and an injunction to stop
the sale and use of their unit,'' said attorney Jon Nelson, who
filed the lawsuit on behalf of Hitachi, a Japanese company whose
U.S. subsidiary is based in Tarrytown, N.Y.
   ``I wouldn't characterize it as as a countersuit,'' Nelson said.
   Motorola, however, called the action an ``expected countermove.''
   ``Motorola expects that the suit will either be withdrawn or
disposed of summarily,'' the company said.
   Motorola's lawsuit, filed Jan. 18, says the Hitachi H-8 series
infringes on at least four Motorola patents. The company is seeking
monetary damages and an injunction.
   Company spokesman Tim Kellogg said Motorola had granted patent
licenses concerning use of microprocessing technology over a 10-year
period without previous problems.
   Both sides opened negotiations in October, but there was no
resolution and Motorola started legal action last week.

   Officials of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have
promised that there will be ``no sacred cows'' when they review
their rules in response to a federal investigation of suspected
fraud in the financial futures market.
   ``We've got to change the rules so even (the) few can't do
anything dishonest with a public order,'' said Leo Melamed, chief
counsel at the Merc and one of its most powerful figures.
   The exchange announced Wednesday it was forming a 10-member panel
to review trading procedures in the wake of the FBI undercover
investigation, known as Operation Sourmash.
   The announcement came as a grand jury convened to hear
prosecutors present evidence in the case, which involves floor
dealings at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Merc _ the world's
largest-volume futures exchanges.
   Although trading activity reflected a business-as-usual
atmosphere at both exchanges, traders admitted to some nervousness.
   ``People say, `Buy the rumor, sell the news,''' said a currency
trader at the Merc who declined to be identified. ``Nobody feels
like they can differentiate between the two any more.''
   The Chicago Tribune, citing unidentified sources, reported today
that the FBI has kept two undercover agents on the trading floors of
the exchanges in a highly unusual move to record traders reacting to
waves of subpoenas.
   The agents have been posing as clerks or messengers to document
statements as traders swap tales of earlier encounters with the FBI
or discuss how to respond to hundreds of subpoenas issused since the
scandal broke last week, the Tribune said.
   Sources told the newspaper that prosecutors are interested in
getting evidence of obstruction of justice.
   The Chicago Sun-Times reported today that part of the
investigation has focused on money laundering through the exchanges.
   Citing federal sources it did not name, the newspaper said an FBI
agent posing as a trader told a real trader he had a ``very
sizeable'' amount of cash he could not report to the goverment and
asked for records showing the money came from trading profits. The
trader agreed, the newspaper said.
   During the investigation, which became public a week ago today,
FBI undercover agents posed as traders, and published reports said
other traders agreed to wear recording devices after confronted by
authorities with evidence of wrongdoing.
   The Tribune today said Operation Sourmash was planned as early as
1984.
   Although federal marshals sealed off the 16th floor of the
downtown Everett Dirksen Federal Building, which in the past has
been used for grand jury testimony, U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas, in
keeping with office policy, declined even to confirm that an
investigation was under way.
   But the Merc's announcement of the creation of the special panel
said improvements in practices and procedures may be necessary ``in
the wake of revelations of a federal investigation.''
   ``It matters not whether this (federal) investigation involves
one member, or many members, of the exchanges,'' said Melamed.
   ``What matters is that we use this opportunity to act responsibly
and make improvements where they are necessary,'' he added. ``There
will be no sacred cows.''
   The panel is made up of five industry officials and five former
or current public officials, among them former Sen. Thomas Eagleton,
D-Missouri.
   ``The Justice Department has no quarrel with me,'' Melamed said.
``While we don't know what they were doing, that doesn't mean we are
on the opposite side of the intent. We're going to use this
opportunity. Here is an environment in which we can make this a
model exchange.''

   Stock prices turned downward today as traders
cashed in on the market's recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.39 to 2,262.50
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 310 up, 565 down and 549
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.92 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Selling was encouraged by rising interest rates in the credit
markets. Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, fell by nearly $5,000 for
each $1,000 in face value.
   Analysts said stock and bond traders were unsettled a bit by word
of a 6.4 percent rise in new factory orders for durable goods last
month.
   That figure, which came in well above advance estimates, was
interpreted as a sign of persistent strength in the economy.
   Traders apparently concluded that it would serve as one more
incentive for the Federal Reserve to maintain a relatively
restrictive credit policy.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Motors, down ] at
89{; Sears Roebuck, down [ at 41{; DuPont, down { at 98, and Eastman
Kodak, down \ at 46~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.34 to 161.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .24 at 319.26.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.46 to
2,265.89.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 803 up, 627 down and 539 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 183.61 million shares, against 189.62
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   Michael Boskin, chosen by President Bush to be
his chief economic adviser, said today the administration intends to
pursue policies that would keep the economy expanding, but cautioned
against looking for a single magic cure that would make continued
growth possible.
   Boskin, testifying at his confirmation hearing before the Senate
Banking Committee, said he planned to advise Bush on such topics as
the budget deficit, inflation, employment and income growth.
   ``It will be our task to provide the soundest possible advice to
President Bush and other administration officials,'' said Boskin,
43, a highly regarded economics professor from Stanford University.
   ``One of the greatest challenges facing us today is the
continuation of what has been the longtime peacetime expansion in
postwar history,'' Boskin said in opening remarks to the committee.
``Though no single policy can guarantee the continued growth and
stability of our economy, the administration is committed to a set
of basic principles aimed at achieving this goal.''
   Boskin, a top campaign adviser to Bush on economic issues, was
expected to have little trouble winning Senate confirmation.
   During the campaign, Boskin developed the ``flexible freeze,''
which became Bush's all-purpose answer to queries on how he planned
to increase spending for a variety of domestic programs while still
lowering the budget deficit without an increase in taxes.
   Under the flexible freeze, the overall growth in federal spending
would be restrained to the level of inflation. Any programs allowed
to grow at a faster pace than inflation would require cuts in
spending in other areas.
   While Bush listed a variety of programs in which he intended to
boost spending, he never specified exactly which programs would face
cuts.
   As head of the three-member Council of Economic Advisers, Boskin
is expected to play a key role along with Darman, chosen as Bush's
budget director, in formulating tax and spending policies for the
new administration.
   Boskin is generally viewed as a mainstream conservative economist
who at times was critical of Reagan administration policies.
   In a book published before he joined the Bush campaign, Boskin
gave a mixed review to Reagan administration policies.
   While praising Reagan's efforts to reduce regulation, cut taxes
and hold down inflation, he said Reagan was ``partly to blame for
the large deficits, due to the defense buildup and his original tax
cut.''
   Boskin has been a longtime proponent of far-reaching changes in
Social Security and other middle-class benefit programs, calling
them ``welfare for the wealthy.''
   In his book, ``Reagan and the Economy,'' Boskin said Reagan's
successor could control government spending ``only by a major attack
on middle-class entitlements.''
   He said Social Security, the Medicare program that pays the
medical bills of the elderly and farm subsidies were all prime
targets for cuts.
   ``The case for reduced spending remains strong in a program such
as Social Security, which pays well-off elderly people many billions
of dollars more than what they and their employers paid in, plus
interest,'' he wrote.
   However, Bush's flexible freeze specifically exempted Social
Security from any limits on its growth each year, and Bush took no
position on cutting middle-class benefit programs during his
campaign.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Reports First Annual Loss In 104-Year History</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. today reported the first
annual loss in its 104-year history, reflecting a previously
announced charge for modernization that reduced net income by $3.96
billion.
   The results, which AT&amp;T had projected last month, resulted from a
$6.72 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter that covers the
cost of scrapping outdated equipment and moving, retiring or laying
off 16,000 employees.
   AT&amp;T's stock was rock solid after the announcement, unchanged at
$30.87{ at midmorning in consolidated New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   ``You say, `My gosh, what a huge charge.' But when it's AT&amp;T and
it's such a large company, people just brush it off and look ahead
to the next quarter. Most companies, it would just wipe them right
out,'' said Audrey Stevoff, an analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in
Chicago.
   AT&amp;T has previously said the charge would have no effect on its
cash flow, its ability to pay dividends or the money available for
investment. Revenue in the fourth quarter and the full year set
records for the period since the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.
   AT&amp;T said it had a net loss of $3.34 billion for the three months
ended Dec. 31, compared with profits of $498 million, or 46 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $9.21 billion from $8.65
billion a year earlier.
   For all of 1988, AT&amp;T said it lost $1.67 billion compared to a
profit of $2.04 billion, or $1.88 a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose to $35.2 billion from $33.8 billion.
   Nynex Corp., one of the companies spun off from AT&amp;T in the 1984
breakup, separately reported a 6.1 percent rise in its
fourth-quarter profit.
   The charge that resulted in AT&amp;T's historic annual loss came from
speeding up its program of getting rid of old phone equipment and
putting in new digital switches and other equipment that uses the
language of computers.
   AT&amp;T said the changes would put the company in a better position
to lower long-distance prices and meet the competition. AT&amp;T is in a
fierce battle for customers, especially big businesses, with MCI
Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co.
   ``The charge for network modernization, despite its effect on
short-term results, was driven by our determination to continue
winning customers in the marketplace,'' said Robert E. Allen, AT&amp;T
chairman. ``Underlying this action are clear indications that 1988
was a year of steady improvement in our operations.''
   New York-based Nynex said its earnings in the quarter ended Dec.
31 rose to $342.2 million, or $1.74 a share, from $322.5 million, or
$1.59 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $3.24 billion from
$3.10 billion.
   For all of 1988, Nynex said its earnings rose to $1.32 billion,
or $6.63 a share, from $1.28 billion, or $6.26 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $12.7 billion from $12.1 billion in 1987.

<HEAD>U.S. Trade Group Interested in Buying ``Bugged'' U.S. Embassy in
Moscow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American trade group has proposed buying the
uncompleted U.S. embassy building in Moscow on which construction
stopped after bugging devices were found in the structure, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
   The Journal of Commerce said Dwayne Andreas, chairman of the
major commodities company Archer Daniels Midland Co., has proposed
buying the building to use as headquarters for a U.S. trade group of
seven companies.
   The proposal has been discussed by U.S. and Soviet officials, but
no decision has been made, the newspaper said, quoting a U.S. State
Department official in Washington.
   ``If the decision was made today to go ahead and make (the new
embassy building) available to the business community, it would take
two years and run roughly $55 million,'' said the official, Joseph
Hulings, special coordinator for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   The embassy originally was set for completion in 1983. Work was
halted in 1985 after the building was found to be riddled with
sophisticated listening devices.
   Sale of the embassy is expected to be one option the Bush
administration will consider when it decides the fate of the
eight-story building on Devyatinsky Street in downtown Moscow,
Hulings said.
   Selling it to American businesses could help raise funds for
building a new embassy and ``remove this as a sticking point in
dealing with Congress and the Soviets and tend to bring the business
community closer to the embassy community in Moscow,'' according to
Hulings.
   Former President Reagan in October said the building should be
torn down and rebuilt.
   In early December, ADM's Andreas spoke with former Deputy
Secretary of State John C. Whitehead to discuss interest among the
members of the American Trade Consortium, Hulings said.
   ``It's been raised with the Soviets with a look at this as a
possible option,'' the newspaper quoted Hulings as saying.
   If the United States decided to sell the building, they would
need permission from the Soviet Union to locate the embassy
elsewhere.
   No one was available at ADM's Decatur, Ill. headquarters to
comment on the article, a secretary in the corporate spokesman's
office said.
   Besides ADM, the trade group includes: Chevron Corp., Eastman
Kodak Co., Ford Motor Co., Johnson &amp; Johnson, RJR Nabisco and
Mercator Corp.

   Gene King used to set lines in the Ouachita
River or the Bouef for catfish. Now he uses a tractor to haul the
slimy whiskered bottom-feeders from 42 acres of ponds that have
replaced his bean fields and pasture.
   ``My father was a farmer. I grew up helping him grow cotton and
cattle, and cattle are still my first love. But as far as
profitability on the land goes, it's catfish that makes sense,'' he
said.
   King, 43, is one of a growing number of Louisiana farmers who are
turning to catfish growing to keep their heads above water
financially.
   No longer considered a poor man's food, catfish are getting a
reputation nationwide as swank cuisine in urban food stores and chic
restaurants that have seized on the exotic Cajun fare of Louisiana.
   Gary Jensen, an associate aquaculture specialist at Louisiana
State University, found a responsive audience in New Orleans at a
recent seminar on catfish farming.
   ``There's no doubt that the traditional row crops are suffering
because of low prices. Farmers are looking for other cash crops and
catfish has been very profitable,'' Jensen said.
   Louisiana, which ranks fourth in catfish production nationally,
behind Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas, had about 1,000 acres of
catfish ponds in 1984, Jensen said. In 1988, 9,000 acres of ponds
were under cultivation.
   ``Catfish farming has sure boomed around here,'' said Albert
Cobb, the manager of Louisiana Catfish Inc. The Wisner, La.,
processing plant has been in operation for 13 months.
   ``We like to think of ourselves as the catfish capital of the
world. We still have a way to go, but we're working on it,'' he said.
   Catfish growers built the plant because of the need for
additional processing facilities, Cobb said. In its first full year
of operation, he said, it processed 5 million pounds of fish.
   ``Catfish is big business around here. Wisner has a population of
2,500 people and we employ 84 of them. What's more, we have plans in
the near future to add another 50, so you can see the kind of impact
we're talking about,'' Cobb said.
   Switching to catfish can be expensive. King puts the costs at
between $2,000 and $2,500 an acre just to build the ponds, construct
the pumping and water systems, and fill the ponds. The fish are
additional.
   ``It's a big initial investment because to raise catfish you have
to have good equipment. The whole name of the game is to raise live
fish, so you need good aeration and good feeding equipment,'' King
said.
   Once the operation is producing fish, however, King said farmers
find they have more money per acre, come harvest.
   ``Overall I'd say your gross yield per acre with catfish is about
$2,600, compared to $600 for soybeans and $300 in cattle. The net
yield would be between $600 and $800 an acre for catfish. It would
be about $250 on soybeans and $200 on cattle,'' he said.
   King said the market for catfish is growing rapidly as well,
ensuring years of demand ahead.
   ``It's not a blue collar fish anymore. The chefs have really
helped the catfish image. They've taken it out of the country and
put it in the cities and that's where the markets are. Us country
folks have always known how good catfish are; city folks are just
learning it,'' he said.
   One thing hasn't changed, King said. He still likes his catfish
cooked the same way he did when his mother used to prepare those he
hauled in on trotline.
   ``Little salt, a little pepper, dip them in cornmeal and fry them
in hot grease. Boy, there ain't nothing better than that,'' he said.

   Futures prices for corn, wheat and soybeans
advanced in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans bounced back from Wednesday's losses of up to 18\ cents
for the spot March contract.
   Traders said bean prices were supported by a report that
overnight showers in South America growing areas were too light and
scattered to help the crop there. Also, confirmation of U.S. soymeal
sales to the Soviet Union supported soybean futures, said analysts.
   Corn and wheat prices advanced on talk of possibly more U.S.
sales of those two commodities to the Soviet Union, they said.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 2{ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.42\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
to 2 cents higher, with March at $2.72\ a bushel; oats were
unchanged to } cent lower, with March at $2.24 a bushel; and
soybeans were 1 cent to 5 cents higher, with March at $7.54 a bushel.
   Cattle futures prices were mixed and pork prices mostly lower in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   In early trading, cattle were .07 cent lower to .05 cent higher,
with the contract for delivery in February at 72.95 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .23 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with January
at 83.42 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .10 cent lower,
with February at 43.30 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were
.10 cent toi 35 cent lower, with February at 39.35 cents a pound.
   On Wednesday, livestock and meat prices traded mostly higher.

   All over America, bankers and their depositors are taking
potshots at what looks to them like a Bush administration tax that
fails the administration's own ``duck test.'' To them, it looks like
a duck, it quacks like a duck, and it's a tax in duck's feathers.
   In question is a proposal, offered by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and defended as ``one option'' by President Bush, to impose a
fee of 25 cents on every $100 deposited into a federally-insured
savings and loan institution, bank or credit union.
   The revenue raised would help bail out the government's S&amp;L
insurance fund.
   ``I think it is a terrible idea,'' Gerald Martel, president of
First Federal Savings and Loan of Lewiston, Maine, said Wednesday
when the idea first flew.
   ``I don't have a clear answer on how you solve this problem in an
equitable manner,'' Martel said, ``but I don't think applying a tax
is an answer.''
   Not a tax, said Bush, gamely. ``I will answer the question with a
question. Is (it) a tax when the person pays the fee to go to
Yosemite Park, using the park?''
   John Sununu, his chief of staff, tried calling it ``an adjustment
upward of the current premium structure.''
   Sununu added that it ``does not pass the duck test and therefore
is not a tax.''
   The duck analogy arose _ on every lip in Washington _ because
only a week ago Richard Darman, Bush's nominee to be budget
director, told senators the president remains opposed to any new
taxes and won't try to fool people by playing on words. ``I think
the burden of that is the duck test _ if it looks like a duck, it's
a duck,'' Darman said.
   Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press spokesmen, contending the proposal
was not a tax, challenged reporters to ask the first 10 people who
walked by a downtown Washington corner if they thought the proposal
is a tax. ``They'll probably say no,'' he said.
   The Washington Post took him up on it and reported today that
seven of the first 10 people on the corner said it was a tax, one
said it wasn't, and two were unsure.
   Fitzwater insisted the idea was not a duck; ``what you're looking
at today is a trial balloon,'' he said.
   A little later, Fitzwater took that back, circulating through the
White House press room, saying, ``It was not an intentional trial
balloon.''
   Whatever. Out in America, it laid an egg.
   ``What I see is a constituency of 240 million people calling
their congressmen about it,'' said William A. Ferguson, chief
operating officer at French Market Homestead Federal Savings
Association in New Orleans.
   ``I don't think it would be popular,'' Ferguson said. ``Whether
it's right or wrong, whether it's the best alternative or not, I
don't think this will gather the popular support to be implemented.''
   ``I would mind a lot,'' said Amy Davis of Little Rock, Ark. ``I'm
the kind of person who has a little bit set back in savings, nothing
to brag about. And I don't think it's right I should pay for their
problems.''
   ``I can't believe they really think this is a solution to the
problem,'' said Norman M. Coulson, president of GlenFed Inc., in
Glendale, Calif., parent of one of the nation's top five S&amp;Ls. ``One
of the problems in our country is our savings rates are not as high
as they should be and this is just another impediment.''
   He made a point familiar to Washington, where the public's low
rate of savings is often deplored. Americans saved only 3.2 cents of
every disposable dollar in 1987, the lowest rate in 40 years.
   ``What's the difference between charging them on their income tax
and doing this?'' Coulson asked, referring to opposition in some
quarters to using taxpayers' money to bail out insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   ``The depositors ... look at how much interest they are going to
earn on their dollars, and if you have an additional assessment to
them they're just going to withdraw it and the cost will be borne by
the institution,'' Coulson said. ``The consumer would have the
opportunity to go to a non-insured institution.''
   ``I don't think it should always come from the little man per
se,'' said depositor Terryann Rutherford at French Market Homestead.
It's hard to always say the government (ought to pay), it's hard to
say the little man (ought to pay),'' Rutherford said.
   ``But it just seems like someone is always coming by the little
man and saying, `Thank you.'''

   House opponents of a 50 percent congressional
pay raise said today they can't stop the increase, despite growing
Senate opposition to the higher salary.
   Rep. Thomas J. Tauke, R-Iowa, a leading opponent of the raise,
said he's now focusing on a long-range strategy that would roll back
the increase, and change the system that permits it to become law
without a vote.
   And Rep. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., who has organized a House
letter-writing drive to Speaker Jim Wright demanding a vote, said,
``We cannot budge the speaker.''
   In the Senate, opposition continued to grow Wednesday after
legislation was filed to block the increase.
   Opposition was turned up a notch outside Congress, too, as three
part-time musicians from the Detroit area released an anti-raise
protest song, ``Tea Bag Revolution.'' The title, with its reference
to the Boston Tea Party, comes from efforts of 30 radio talk show
hosts, who are behind a national drive to send tea bags to lawmakers
with the message: ``Read my tea bag. No fifty percent raise for
Congress.''
   Legislation that would reject the pay raise, and roll it back
should it take effect, was introduced Wednesday in the Senate. The
legislation had a dozen sponsors in the morning, and 23 by day's end
_ nearly a quarter of the 100-member Senate.
   The proposed pay raise for members of Congress, judges and top
executive branch officials would become law automatically Feb. 8
unless each chamber rejects it. Rank-and-file lawmakers would see
their pay go from $89,500 to $135,000.
   Opponents of the raise were grasping at anything that could give
them momentum Wednesday.
   When House Minority Whip Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., sent out a letter
that no votes were scheduled through Feb. 8, House pay-raise
opponents scheduled a news conference for today to urge a vote.
   Pete Williams, a spokesman for Cheney, said the schedule was for
planning purposes and ``never intended to have any significance for
the pay raise.''
   Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, a co-sponsor of the legislation
to roll back the pay raise, remembered that President Bush said he
would ``have something to say'' about the raise after he was
inaugurated.
   Grassley wrote Bush on Wednesday, ``You must choose between
aligning yourself with Speaker (Jim) Wright and a dozen in the House
leadership who favor the raise...and the 85 percent of the American
people who oppose the issue.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters, ``we are
watching congressional action at the moment.''
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said Tuesday the House
Democratic leadership does not plan to schedule a vote before the
deadline.
   Mark Johnson, a spokesman for Wright, D-Texas, said the speaker
has not given indications a vote would be scheduled to stop the
raise.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, has promised
a Senate vote on rejecting the raise before the deadline.
   But he told reporters Wednesday, ``I favor a comprehensive
approach that includes enactment of the ethics bill the president
vetoed, campaign finance reform, a ban on honoraria and enactment of
compensation to offset the loss in honoraria.''
   He said the package could not be pulled together before the
automatic trigger for the raise.
   The ethics bill, vetoed by Reagan and introduced again Wednesday
by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., would restrict lobbying by former
members of Congress, their staffs and top executive branch
officials. Campaign finance reform would impose limits on campaign
spending.
   The National Taxpayers Union, a non-profit group organizing
opposition to the pay raise, played the new protest song for
reporters. It was recorded by Keith Wood, Rich Boehms and Mike Grass.
   The chorus goes:
   ``There's no more money, we're angry as can be.
   ``So we've joined the Tea Bag Revolution.
   ``Repeating history.''
   And one of the verses says:
   ``We've come to be that money tree.
   ``They pick from more and more.
   ``Now I think it's time, the people remind them, who they're
working for.''

   Stock prices forged ahead again today, overcoming
some early selling by traders cashing in on recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 6 points
in early trading, was up 6.61 at 2,272.50 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 645 up, 564 down and
601 unchanged.
   The early selling was encouraged by rising interest rates in the
credit markets.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell by nearly $5 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   Analysts said stock and bond traders were unsettled a bit by word
of a 6.4 percent rise in new factory orders for durable goods last
month. That figure, which came in well above advance estimates, was
interpreted as a sign of persistent strength in the economy.
   Traders apparently concluded that it would serve as one more
incentive for the Federal Reserve to maintain a relatively
restrictive credit policy.
   However, brokers said, the early pullback quickly attracted
buyers who apparently had been waiting for such a moment to get in
on the market's recent rally.
   RJR Nabisco rose ] to 95] in active trading. Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. was reported to be close to completing financing
arrangements for the buyout of the company by Kohlberg Kravis

<TEXT>
   Sara Lee Corp. said Thursday its second-quarter
profit rose 39 percent, due mainly to strong sales and high demand
for its products, including its frozen baked goods.
   Net income for the three months ending Dec. 31 totaled $137.3
million, or $1.19 a share, up from $99.1 million, or 88 cents a
share in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose 16 percent to $3.1
billion, from $2.6 billion in the same period last year.
   Sara Lee spokeswoman Ann M. McCarthy said quarterly sales and
earnings reached historical highs.
   For the first six months of the fiscal year, Sara Lee said net
income rose 32 percent to $212.8 million, or $1.84 a share, up from
$161 million, or $1.42 a share in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue
rose 16 percent to $$5.8 billion from $5 billion in the previous
year.
   ``Our strong earnings gain reflects our ability to satisfy the
consistently strong demand for our high-quality products,'' said
John H. Bryan Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of the
Chicago-based company.
   Sales and operating income for Sara Lee Personal Products
increased sharply in the second quarter, reflecting a strong showing
from the company's hosiery and knit products businesses as well as
the acquisitions of Stedman Corp., Adams-Millis and 61 percent
ownership of Dim, S.A.
   Sara Lee, an international package food and consumer products
company with annual sales of more than $10 billion, said its bakery
posted a 5 percent volume increase while packaged meats volume rose
7 percent in the quarter, particularly Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm
and Kahn's brands.

<HEAD>Dow Jones Reports 14.5 Percent Earnings Drop; Time Inc. Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. on Thursday reported a 12 percent earnings increase in
the fourth quarter of 1988, but Dow Jones &amp; Co. said a yearlong
financial advertising slump was to blame for a 14.5 percent drop in
profits in the period.
   A.H. Belo Corp., owner of The Dallas Morning News and broadcast
properties, said earnings fell about 51 percent in the quarter,
partly because of an asset write-down.
   Time, based in New York, reported earnings of $58 million, or
$1.01 a share, on revenue of $1.21 billion. That was up from $52
million, or 88 cents a share, on revenue of $1.13 billion in the
corresponding 1987 quarter.
   Time said the increase came despite a $35 million pre-tax charge
to reduce the value on its books of a satellite 50 percent owned by
Home Box Office Inc., a Time subsidiary.
   Operating profits from Time's magazines were $87 million, up from
$81 million a year earlier, while cable television profits increased
to $57 million from $40 million in the 1987 period.
   For the full year, earnings were up 16 percent to $289 million,
or $5.01 a share, on revenue of $4.51 billion. In 1987, they were
$250 million, or $4.18 a share, on revenue of $4.19 billion.
   New York-based Dow Jones reported earnings of $43.1 million, or
43 cents a share, on revenue of $413 million in the fourth quarter.
That was down from $50.3 million, or 52 cents a share, on revenue of
$417 million in the corresponding 1987 quarter.
   For the full year, Dow Jones earnings increased 12.4 percent to
$228 million, or $2.35 a share, on revenue of $1.6 billion, compared
to profits of $203 million, or $2.10 a share, on revenue of $1.31
billion in 1987.
   But without $29.4 million in income from sale of its Richard D.
Irwin Inc. book-publishing subsidiary in early 1987, Dow Jones would
have posted an earnings decline for 1988.
   It said Wall Street Journal advertising linage declined 11.6
percent overall and Barron's advertising fell 16.3 percent last year.
   In the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash, circulation
of both influential financial publications also fell, with the
Monday-to-Friday Journal dropping 4.8 percent to 1.95 million and
the weekly Barron's slipping 13.4 percent to 246,500.
   A.H. Belo said earnings for the fourth quarter were $2.5 million,
or 12 cents per share, compared with $5.1 million, or 25 cents per
share, for the same quarter in the previous year.
   The company blamed the drop partly on a write-down of syndicated
programming and higher newsprint cost.
   Net income for all of 1988 were $10.1 million, or 51 cents per
share, compared with $22.3 million, or $1.04 per share, in 1987.
   In addition to the Morning News, A.H. Belo owns WFAA-TV of
Dallas, KHOU-TV of Houston, a Dallas-Fort Worth suburban newspaper
chain, KXTV in Sacramento, Calif., WVEC-TV in Hampton-Norfolk, Va.,
and KOTV in Tulsa, Okla.

   About 15.7 million shares of West Point-Pepperell common stock
had been tendered by shareholders as of the close of business

   Chicago-based Farley, maker of Fruit of the Loom underwear and
Acme boots, first made its $48-per-share cash offer Oct. 25 to
acquire Pepperell, the nation's largest publicly held textile
company.
   Pepperell, based in West Point, Ga., has been battling the
takeover in court.
   Farley also said a special Pepperell shareholders meeting is
scheduled Feb. 25, when Farley will seek to oust current Pepperell
directors.

   Share prices rose sharply Thursday on the London
Stock Exchange as continued institutional buying combined with a
lack of sellers in certain issues to produce sudden rises among the
leading shares.
   Dealers said the market continued to benefit from growing
optimism about interest rates, which has sparked renewed buying
interest among major institutions. Recent signs of a slowdown in
consumer spending have helped convince many participants that base
lending rates have peaked at their current 13 percent level.
   But the market still faced a test Friday with the scheduled
release of British current account data for December. The market
expects the December current account gap to narrow slightly.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 20.8
points, or 1.07 percent, at 1959.8.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index closed 20.5 points
higher at 1601.3. Volume was 624.5 million shares, down from 924.7
million shares a day earlier, but still well above the prevailing
level toward the end of last year.
   The Financial Times 500-share index was 1,104.02, up 11.38.

   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said Thursday it has
reclassified four companies in its index of 500 stocks under
different industry groups to reflect the changing focus of the
companies.
   Owens Corning Fiberglass Corp., Whitman Corp., N.L. Industries
and Primerica were approved for transfer by the S&amp;P 500 Index
committee.
   Owens Corning was moved to the building materials group from a
miscellaneous heading because of its recent restructuring. Owens
Corning, which divested its aerospace and strategic materials
divisions in 1987, now gets most of its revenue from construction
products, mainly fiberglass products. It will represent 14.8 percent
of the market value of the S&amp;P Building Materials Group.
   Whitman has been transferred to foods from conglomerates after
selling several of its businesses, including Illinois Central
railroad. Its current operations include Pet Inc. and Pepsi Cola
Bottling. Whitman, formerly I.C. Industries, will represent 6.5
percent of the S&amp;P Foods group.
   N.L. Industries is now under the chemicals heading, transferred
from oil well equipment &amp; services after spinning off its petroleum
services business.
   Primerica will be recategorized under financial miscellaneous
from personal loans. Primerica is the new name for the former
commercial credit group which recently acquired Primerica Corp.
   N.L. will represent 2 percent of the chemicals group and
Primerica will represent 8.1 percent of the financial miscellaneous
group.
   The S&amp;P 500 is made up of 500 stock prices including 400
industrials, 40 utilities, 20 transportation and 40 financial
issues. The index is further broken down into 89 industry groups.
   The index is designed to provide investors with a representative
measure of overall stock market performance.

   The U.S. dollar fell against major currencies
except the West German mark and Swiss franc in European trading
Thursday. Gold prices rose.
   There was a short-lived rally early in the day after news that
U.S. durable goods buying surged 6.4 percent in December, when the
expectation had been for a rise of 0.3 percent.
   But the dollar slipped again when details showed some of the
gains were from large defense and transportation orders.
   No interventions by central banks selling dollars were reported
but the threat of dollar sales was enough to restrain the market,
dealers said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 127.52 Japanese yen from 127.65 late
Wednesday. In London late Thursday the dollar traded lower at 128.15
yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7730 from $1.7710 late
Tuesday.
   Other late rates for the dollar Thursday compared with
Wednesday's late rates: 1.8440 West German marks, up from 1.8435;
1.5671 Swiss francs, up from 1.5670; 6.2705 French francs, down from

   Gold bullion prices rose by about $1.50 a troy ounce in Europe.
   The closing price in London and Zurich was a bid $405.75 a troy
ounce, up from $404.25 in both cities Wednesday. Earlier in Hong

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. will soon announce plans for a
$1.2 billion European car plant to position itself for the
unification of the Common Market in 1992, according to sources and a
published report Thursday.
   Sources said the move is pending a response from a partner,
believed to be a car manufacturer in a European country.
   Toyota officials confirmed that the Japanese company has narrowed
the list of possible sites and partners for European passenger car
production.
   The plans under study reportedly include establishment of either
an independent manufacturing operation or a joint venture in
Britain, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, West Germany or France.
   The plan is believed to involve a $1.2 billion investment that
eventually could create more than 1,000 jobs, the Financial Times of
London reported Thursday. The newspaper said an announcement on the
project is expected by mid-February.
   Toyota, Japan's biggest automaker, is aiming to have an assembly
base in Western Europe before the creation of the EEC's single
community market in 1992, the newspaper said.
   The single market is intended to establish a free flow of goods
in the 12-nation trade bloc through harmonization of tax laws and
other measures. Many imports from Japan and other countries are
expected to be subject to restrictions.
   In addition, the move would allow Toyota to dodge Japanese
government restrictions on auto exports to the EEC. Toyota has
lagged far begind Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. in Europe.
   Toyota Executive Vice President Tsutomu Ohshima said recently,
``With continuing Japanese government restrictions necessitated to
ease trade tension with the EC, we are not in a situation where we
can keep scaling up our exports.
   ``We have no choice but to go to Europe to supply cars as an EC
insider,'' he said, adding that Toyota wants to produce cars with a
European partner to smooth entry into the highly protectionist
market.
   Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has limited
increases in Japanese car and commercial vehicle exports to Europe
since mid-1986.
   Last year, Toyota shipped 291,084 cars and commercial vehicles to
the EEC, up 3.5 percent from 1987. Nissan's Europe-bound exports
edged up 0.6 percent to 322,633 vehicles in the same year.
   Passenger car production would follow Toyota's joint project in
West Germany with Volkswagen AG, which began manufacturing
Toyota-designed Taro pickup trucks at Volkswagen's Hanover plant at
the beginning of the year.

<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. was deceptive in advertising
its soups as good for the heart without disclosing their high sodium
content, the Federal Trade Commission charged today.
   The company said it stands behind the ads in question, which are
no longer running, and will contest the commission's charge.
   The FTC complaint said Campbell did not have substantiation for
its claim that most of its soups ``make a positive contribution to a
diet that reduces the risk of heart disease.''
   The commission is seeking an order from an administrative law
judge that would forbid Campbell from asserting that soups
containing more than 500 milligrams of sodium per eight-ounce
serving are good for the heart without also stating the sodium
content of the soup.
   Campbell makes 70 different kinds of condensed soup, plus two
different low-sodium lines. The commission staff declined to discuss
what it knows about the sodium content of all the regular varieties,
but an inspection of six at a supermarket showed sodium levels
ranging from 710 milligrams for turkey vegetable to 910 milligrams
for chicken noodle.
   Sodium is part of sodium chloride, ordinary table salt, which
manufacturers add to food to enhance taste. A teaspoon of salt
contains about 2,000 milligrams or two grams of sodium.
   A committee of the National Academy of Sciences has recommended
that most Americans limit their sodium intake to 1,100 to 3,300
milligrams per day. Though 200 milligrams is considered adequate,
most Americans get 4,000 to 6,000 milligrams a day.
   The commission objected to a magazine ad which said the company's
soups were high in fiber, low in fat and cholesterol and high in
calcium when made with milk.
   Chicken noodle, it said, ``is low in fat and has just 15
milligrams of cholesterol. And that's especially good to know
because research tells us that a diet low in fat and cholesterol may
help reduce the risk of some forms of heart disease.''
   ``We are always supportive'' of health information in ads, said
William MacLeod, director of the commission's Bureau of Consumer
Protection.
   But health claims, if made, must not be directly undermined by
undisclosed facts, he said.
   ``If they don't advertise the heart-healthiness of the soup, this
(proposed) order wouldn't come into play,'' he said.
   Many experts contend that excess sodium leads to high blood
pressure, which is known to increase the risk of heart disease and
heart attack. But some dissenters argue that studies show some
people tolerate a wide range of sodium in the diet without change in
blood pressure while, for unknown reasons, other people are ``salt
sensitive,'' with pressure rising sharply once a threshold of sodium
concentration is passed.
   MacLeod acknowledged the scientific dispute, and said the
commission would rely heavily on last year's ``Report on Nutrition
and Health'' issued by the surgeon general, which said diets high in
sodium ``clearly contribute'' to high blood pressure.
   In Camden, N.J., Campbell spokesman David Hackney said, ``We
stand behind our advertising and we don't think it's misleading''
since the sodium content is disclosed on every can.
   The two-page magazine ad in question has not run since March
1988. Hackney said the company's decision to drop it had nothing to
do with the commission's investigation.

   Futures prices for wheat and soybeans advanced but
corn was mixed at the close Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans bounced back in early trading from Wednesday's losses of
up to 18\ cents, then they lost ground but finally rallied before
the final bell to finish up 15 cents for March spot contract.
   ``After the market failed yesterday, traders were very jittery,''
said Mickey Luth, soybeans analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Confirmation of U.S. soymeal sales to the Soviet Union supported
soybean futures, but weighing on prices were continued expectations
of a good crop from South America, said Luth.
   Wheat and corn prices were boosted by the Agriculture Department
strengthening the possibility of more sales of those two commodities
to the Soviet Union, said Jerry Gidel of G.H. Miller.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 4{ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.44\ a bushel; corn was 1} cents
lower to 2} cents higher, with March at $2.72} a bushel; oats were
2{ cents to 3{ cent lower, with March at $2.24 a bushel; and
soybeans were 11 cents to 16\ cents higher, with March at $7.54 a
bushel.

   The stock market kept its early-1989 rally in
high gear today, overcoming some early selling by traders cashing in
on recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 6 points
in early trading, was up 21.43 at 2,287.32 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 888 up, 526 down and
532 unchanged.
   The early selling was encouraged by rising interest rates in the
credit markets.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell by nearly $5 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   Analysts said stock and bond traders were unsettled a bit by word
of a 6.4 percent rise in new factory orders for durable goods last
month. That figure, which came in well above advance estimates, was
interpreted as a sign of persistent strength in the economy.
   Traders apparently concluded that it would serve as one more
incentive for the Federal Reserve to maintain a relatively
restrictive credit policy.
   However, brokers said, the early pullback quickly attracted
buyers who apparently had been waiting for such a moment to get in
on the market's recent rally.
   RJR Nabisco rose { to 95{ in active trading. Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. was reported to be close to completing financing
arrangements for the buyout of the company by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co.
   Big-name computer and technology issues also were strong. Digital
Equipment climbed 3\ to 114~; International Business Machines 3 to
126\, and Hewlett-Packard 1| to 57].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.10 to 163.43. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.56 at 321.06.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 168.29 million shares with an

   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., a leading marketer of
business information, including the well-known Nielsen television
rating system, on Thursday reported higher profits for the fourth
quarter and all of 1988.
   The company netted $123.06 million, or 66 cents per share, for
the period ended Dec. 31, up 18 percent from earnings of $104.47
million, or 56 cents, in 1987. Revenue rose 11 percent to $1.13
billion from $1.02 billion.
   For the year it earned $498.96 million, or $2.67 a share, on
revenue of $4.26 billion. That was 14 percent higher than 1987
earnings of $439.05 million, or $2.36, and revenue of $3.78 billion.
   Last year was marked by the announcement of a major restructuring
in which the company said it would discontinue some businesses and
product lines. In December it sold the the Official Airline Guides,
which includes travel guides and magazines, to British publisher
Robert Maxwell for $750 million.
   The restructuring also included employee reductions,
consolidation and streamlining of computer and production facilities
and the phaseing out of the manual collection of household panel
information by Nielsen Marketing Research. ``Our 1988 results met
our expectations, and we believe the actions we have taken will
enhance D&amp;B's ability to sustain its strong operating performance in
1989 and beyond.'' Chairman Charles W. Moritz said in a statement.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet said the pre-tax costs associated with the
restructuring exceeded by $32.05 million the pre-tax gain from the
sale of Official Airline Guides.
   The fourth-quarter results also included the $140 million cash
acquisition of American Credit Indemnity Co., the nation's leading
business credit-insurance company, from Commercial Credit Co. In
addition, Dun &amp; Bradstreet announced it acquired Logistics Data
Systems Inc., a worldwide supplier of software and systems for
retailers.

<HEAD>Girding For Phone Wars, AT&amp;T Reports First Annual Loss In Its 104
Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. on Thursday
reported the first annual loss in its 104-year history, the result
of a huge write-off to streamline for long-distance phone wars.
   The historic loss was no surprise to shareholders _ AT&amp;T forecast
it last month _ but it nevertheless signaled the growing urgency of
competition in the long-distance phone business.
   AT&amp;T took a $6.72 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of
1988 to cover costs of accelerating its transition to digital
technology, which uses the language of computers to send voices and
data over fiber-optic lines.
   The company is scrapping outdated analog phone equipment and
moving, retiring or laying off 16,000 employees.
   AT&amp;T's stock was unchanged at $30.87{ in late afternoon trading
on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, reflecting investors'
unconcern. The write-off has no effect on AT&amp;T's cash flow, ability
to pay dividends or money available for investment.
   AT&amp;T lost $3.34 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31 and $1.67
billion in all of 1988.
   ``You say, `My gosh, what a huge charge.' But when it's AT&amp;T and
it's such a large company, people just brush it off and look ahead
to the next quarter,'' said Audrey Stevoff, an analyst at Duff &amp;
Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   AT&amp;T was forced to speed up its introduction of digital services
to meet the competition from MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint
Communications Co., which have been steadily taking away its
customers.
   The fight is most ferocious for Fortune 100 accounts, the giants
such as General Electric Co., Ford Motor Co. and Du Pont Co. that
have phone bills of millions of dollars a month.
   AT&amp;T, the only long-distance company with regulated rates,
complains that federal regulation is preventing it from responding
flexibly to special offers by unregulated MCI and US Sprint.
   ``I'm getting my clock cleaned,'' Joseph P. Nacchio, an AT&amp;T vice
president who appears in commercials, complained to reporters this
month in Washington, according to a trade publication, Report on
AT&amp;T. ``I'm losing (customers) faster than I can count them right
now.''
   Responding to the threat, AT&amp;T is pushing hard for regulatory
reform in Washington and has redeployed thousands of people into
sales jobs. Meanwhile, its money-losing computer business got a big
boost from a $1 billion Air Force contract last year.
   Executives of GE, Ford and Du Pont, all major customers of AT&amp;T,
said in interviews Thursday that they consider themselves big
winners from the cutthroat battle for their business.
   With new services, higher quality and lower prices, ``corporate
America has really benefited by what really is almost entirely due
to competition,'' said Stan Welland, GE's manager of corporate
telecommunications.
   Du Pont uses high-volume data ``pipes'' to carry traffic between
a research center in Victoria, Texas, and a supercomputer at its
Wilmington, Del., headquarters.
   Ford keeps in touch with dealerships via phone links to computer
terminals in the dealers' finance and service areas.
   ``Telecommunications is an area that 10 years ago was somewhat of
a backwater. AT&amp;T took care of that for you. Today's it's an
essential part of the technical infrastructure,'' said S.I. Gilman,
Ford's executive director of information systems.
   Most residential customers and small businesses also are
benefiting from the competition, but not as much. They don't use new
services such as video conferencing. Also, higher local charges
offset the drop in long-distance rates for people who don't make
many long-distance calls.
   AT&amp;T pointed out that in spite of its loss from the one-time
charge, its revenue in the fourth quarter and full year were the
highest since the Bell System breakup five years ago.
   Without the charge, earnings would have risen 19 percent in the
quarter and 11 percent for the full year.
   ``The charge for network modernization, despite its effect on
short-term results, was driven by our determination to continue
winning customers in the marketplace,'' AT&amp;T Chairman Robert E.
Allen said in a statement. ``Underlying this action are clear
indications that 1988 was a year of steady improvement in our
operations.''
   AT&amp;T's $3.34 billion fourth-quarter net loss compared with
profits of $498 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose to $9.21 billion from $8.65 billion a year earlier.
   For the full year, the $1.67 billion loss compared to a profit of
$2.04 billion, or $1.88 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to
$35.2 billion from $33.8 billion.
   AT&amp;T faces talks in April with the Communication Workers of
America, which represents 135,000 employees. Union spokeswoman Gaye
Williams Mack said Thursday the company is cutting hourly workers,
``but they're not cutting the fat out of management.''
   MCI and US Sprint are not organized by the union.

   The stock market swept ahead today, extending its
early-1989 rally to new post-crash highs after overcoming an early
round of selling.
   Analysts said the market drew some support from talk in
Washington of a possible move toward restoring a capital gains tax
break.
   ``I think the capital gains tax is too high,'' Chairman Alan
Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board told the Senate Finance
Committee.
   Brokers also said the market benefited from catch-up buying by
professionals and money managers unhappy about missing out on the
market's gains since late last fall.
   A brief early decline was prompted by an upswing in credit-market
interest rates. However, brokers said, the pullback attracted buyers
who apparently had been waiting for an opportune moment to buy.

   Appliance maker Maytag Corp. and Chicago
Pacific Co., the manufacturer of Hoover vacuum cleaners, announced
Thursday the completion of their $1 billion merger.
   The combination was approved by stockholders of both companies
and became effective with the filing of legal documents in Delaware,
where Maytag is incorporated.
   Maytag's acquisition of Chicago Pacific began Oct. 28 with a cash
tender offer, under which Maytag bought 6.4 million shares, or about
49 percent, of Chicago Pacific stock for $60 a share, or a total of
$384 million.
   The remainder of Chicago Pacific's shares were exchanged for
Maytag stock. The total cost of the transaction was put at nearly $1
billion.
   The merger creates a $3 billion a year corporation by bringing
Chicago Pacific's Hoover division and five furniture companies under
Maytag.
   Maytag, headquartered in Newton, had 1987 sales of $1.8 billion.
   Chicago-based Chicago Pacific Corp. was formed in 1984 in the
reorganization of the former Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific
Railroad. Its 1987 sales totaled $1.4 billion.

<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union, born in protest, is
facing its most serious internal conflict in 40 years.
   A band of dissidents, led by UAW Region 5 Director Jerry Tucker
of St. Louis, is mounting a challenge to the policies of union
President Owen Bieber and his followers, allied in the
Administration Caucus.
   The caucus meets Friday and Saturday in Dearborn, Mich., to talk
about strategies, including how to handle Tucker and his troops in
advance of the union's triennial constitutional convention in June
in Anaheim, Calif.
   The opposition is the noisiest since the first decade of the UAW,
which grew out of a 1937 sit-down strike in Flint, Mich.
   Despite that, union insiders and labor analysts don't see a
threat to Bieber's presidency. Tucker himself is not seen as a
challenger to Bieber, but his dissident stance is nonetheless
unsettling to the union's leadership.
   ``I think (the administration's) concern is that it is unknown,
that it represents something that can tap into concerns on down the
road,'' said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of
California at San Diego who follows labor relations between the
union and the Big Three automakers.
   Since Bieber became the union's commander-in-chief in 1983, the
UAW has signed agreements calling for more worker participation in
management and increased job security in return for a blurring of
the traditional job classification lines.
   That has been the source of Tucker's discontent.
   ``Something's wrong'' when General Motors Corp. ``can speed up
the line in violation of contracts and union representatives say,
`We just have to let that happen,''' Tucker said in September.
   Parts of the ``New Directions'' message of Tucker and his
supporters isn't new to the UAW. Tucker said the union needs to turn
to its roots and take a more militant stand against the automakers.
   ``It is certainly more militant in a traditional sense than what
the union has done,'' Shaiken said. ``It also seeks a different way
to address the core issues that the union faces: job security and
the role of the union in a global auto market.
   ``It's not simply the '30s or the '40s recycled for the '80s,''
Shaiken added. ``I think there is more substance to it.''
   But a UAW source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
challenge to the administration this year is similar to past union
election years.
   ``The part of Chicken Little will be played by the challengers,''
the source said. ``They have no choice but to say the sky is
falling. In that sense, the evidence doesn't support that there is a
crisis.''
   In 1984, Bieber appointed Tucker as assistant director of Region
5, the largest in the UAW with about 80,000 members in eight states
stretching between Colorado and Louisiana.
   Two years later, Tucker fell out of Bieber's graces when he ran
against Region 5 Director Ken Worley for a seat on the UAW's
22-member international executive board, which executes union
policies set by conventions.
   Bieber fired Tucker four days after he declared his candidacy,
saying he violated a union election rule. Tucker sued Bieber and the
union, claiming his rights were violated. He lost that challenge in
a Detroit federal court earlier this month.
   In the 1986 Region 5 election, Worley won by one of the narrowest
margins in union history. Tucker contested the election, claiming
union money was used in Worley's campaign, and a federally
supervised election was ordered by the National Labor Relations
Board.
   In that vote last September, Tucker defeated Worley and was
elected to the executive board. It was a major setback for Bieber.
   ``I have no problem with dissent, but with one exception. You
have to operate by the rules. You don't operate by tearing down the
union,'' Bieber said then.
   Tucker since has made dozens of appearances around the country,
and some union members have been hooking onto his New Directions
train. But it's tough to gauge Tucker's support, or a lack of
support, for Bieber.
   The dissident slate of candidates for UAW offices is unclear. It
is presumed Bieber will seek his third three-year term.
   ``The key question is, `Will Jerry Tucker basically hit a
responsive chord among large number of union members or leaders?'''
Shaiken asked. ``That is an open question and that's what makes the
Administration Caucus quite nervous.''

   Madison Square Garden will shut down for the next
two summers for a $100-million makeover to expand amenities and
triple the number of exclusive box seats, Gulf &amp; Western Inc., the
arena's owner, said Thursday.
   The announcement effectively confirmed reports that Gulf &amp;
Western had decided against building a new Garden for $300 million
at another site and erecting a $1-billion office complex on the
Garden's current site.
   Garden President Richard H. Evans denied that a softening market
for office space had played a role in the decision.
   ``It may have had something to do with what went up on this site
if we moved,'' he said. ``It did not have anything to do with the
decision about whether or not we should move.''
   Fans attending sports and entertainment events will notice 40
percent more rest rooms, bigger concession areas with more varied
menus and the disappearance of about 10 percent of the cheapest
seats.
   There also will be better lighting and sound and an up-to-date
video display scoreboard, Evans told a news conference. The arena's
capacity will remain the same, about 20,000 depending on the event.
   The most extensive renovation will occur in the Garden's
adjoining theater, the Felt Forum, which will be turned around 180
degrees, given a new, modern stage and 1,500 more seats, bringing
capacity to 6,000, Evans said.
   The Garden will be closed June-August for two years to
accommodate the construction. The Felt Forum will close in September
for two years, reopening in September 1991 as the Forum Theater, he
said.
   The renovation will not interfere with the Garden's professional
basketball and hockey teams, the Knicks and Rangers, both of which
also are owned by Gulf &amp; Western. Evans said an alternate facility
was being sought for the Garden's boxing promotions while the Felt
Forum is closed.

<HEAD>Friends Say Milken Likely To Fight Expected Indictment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s senior
junk-bond trader Michael Milken, about to be jettisoned by the firm
he parlayed into a financial superpower, appears ready to fight a
criminal prosecution that menaces his carefully built reputation as
business genius and philanthropist.
   Milken's associates said Thursday it was unlikely he would strike
a plea bargain with the federal prosecutors in New York who
extracted a record $650 million settlement from Drexel in the
biggest securities fraud case in history.
   Court papers revealed Wednesday that terms of the settlement
require it to fire Milken and withhold the 1988 compensation due
him, estimated at $200 million. His lawyers said the terms amount to
an outrageous, disgraceful and illegal punishment, which they
indicated would be challenged in court.
   For the 42-year-old capitalism evangelist, racketeering and fraud
charges expected to be filed within days represent far more than
loss of a job. Indeed, with a personal wealth estimated by Forbes
magazine at $800 million and an undisputed knack for making money,
he can survive the loss financially.
   But the criminal and related civil cases against him and Drexel
have for two years cast a highly publicized cloud over a remarkable
career that revolves around his virtually single-handed creation of
the market in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.
   They also have brought attention and sympathy from the many who
know Milken as a devoted family man, attentive friend and donor of
millions of dollars to charity.
   Their portrayal stands in sharp contrast to the portrayal of
Milken by government investigators as a scheming, manipulative,
arrogant and greedy trader who colluded with now-imprisoned inside
trader Ivan Boesky to violate a range of securities laws.
   Milken hasn't talked publicly about whether he'll fight the feds
but he has consistently denied any wrongdoing. His lawyers, friends
and associates expect he won't change his mind, despite what they
call unprecedented pressure on him by U.S. prosecutors.
   ``My sense of things is this is a man who thinks he has done
nothing to blacken his family's name _ and that's important to him.
He's very resolute,'' said Jesse Kornbluth, a Vanity Fair writer who
spent many hours with Milken over the summer while preparing an
article and still chats with him frequently on the telephone.
   ``I expect him to fight it,'' echoed Clark Johnson, president and
chief executive officer of Pier 1 Imports, which has financed
expansion with the help of Milken and Drexel.
   Drexel is expected to survive the loss of Milken, though it was
he and his junk bond traders who transformed the firm from an
insignificant brokerage house to a powerful force on Wall Street.
Milken, once the prime mover in the junk bond market, is no longer
indispensable, analysts said.
   ``If this had occurred a couple of years ago, it might have been
a real big problem with (Drexel), but the junk bond market is pretty
well established and they are pretty well established in the
market,'' said Larry Eckenfelder, who follows the securities
business for Prudential Bache Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   Milken is widely credited with single-handedly persuading
investors that there was gold in junk _ the high-yield, high-risk
bonds issued by companies too small or too weak to earn the
endorsement of bond-rating firms.
   He preached the idea that a junk bond investor could earn high
interest and protect himself from the potential default of one
company by holding a portfolio of bonds in a number of companies.
   With success has come incredible largess: Milken and his brother
and business associate Lowell, through three family trusts, have
given more than $17 million to 200 charities in the last six years.
   Some of the recipients say Milken gives of himself as generously
as he does of his money.
   Barbara Firestone, who runs a Los Angeles-area organization for
children who are retarded or have emotional problems, said Milken
often visits the children. The trader, who has given more than
$850,000 to the group called H.E.L.P, knows many of the children by
name, and exhorts them to fulfill their potential.
   As recently as two weeks ago, he called from New York, where he
apparently was working on his legal defense, to get advice on the
proper present for a teen-age girl who had invited him to a ceremony
marking her graduation from one of H.E.L.P.'s programs.
   Asked if the Milken she knows could be capable of fraud, Ms.
Firestone said:
   ``I don't know. All I know is that I see a man who's gentle,
unassuming, unpretentious, very caring, very committed. It's not the
man you see in the newspaper.''

   Foreign exchange traders pushed the dollar
slightly higher Thursday, again testing central banks' commitment to
holding the U.S. currency in check.
   Dealers said there was no firm reason for the dollar's climb,
although there was a brief rally after a report that U.S. durable
goods orders surged 6.4 percent in December. Many had expected a 0.3
percent rise.
   The dollar retreated somewhat when details showed some of the
gains were from large defense and transportation orders.
   The Federal Reserve sold some dollars for West German marks late
in New York's trading session, dealers said.
   The underlying demand for dollars comes from investors who want
to take advantage of relatively high U.S. interest rates, said
Phillip Eriksen, a senior vice president at Wells Fargo Bank in San
Francisco.
   High yields also have attracted investors to the Canadian and
Australian dollars and the British pound, Eriksen said. The Canadian
dollar touched a seven-year high against the U.S. dollar in
Thursday's session but ended slightly below Wednesday's level.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 127.52 Japanese yen from 127.65 late
Wednesday. In London late Thursday the dollar traded at 128.15 yen,
and later in New York the dollar rose to 128.32 yen from 127.43 late
Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7730 from $1.7710 late
Tuesday. In New York, sterling fell to $1.7673 from $1.7708 late
Wednesday.
   Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8475 West German marks, up from
1.8405; 1.5705 Swiss francs, up from 1.5630; 1.1850 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1841; 6.2833 French francs, up from 6.2553; and
1,351.6 Italian lire, up from 1,345.5.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Wednesday's late rates, included: 1.8440 West German marks, up from
1.8435; 1.5671 Swiss francs, up from 1.5670; 6.2705 French francs,
down from 6.2715; 2.0815 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0820; 1,350.25
Italian lire, down from 1,350.50; and 1.1816 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1840.
   Gold bullion rose by about $1.50 a troy ounce in Europe but fell
later in New York.
   The closing price in London and Zurich was a bid of $405.75 a
troy ounce, up from $404.25 in both cities Wednesday. Earlier in
Hong Kong, gold closed at $407.70 a troy ounce, up from $406.57.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $403 an ounce from $406 on Wednesday. Later,
Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold bullion at $402 an
ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $405.25 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $6.19 a troy
ounce, up from $6.12. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $6.104 an ounce from $6.17 Wednesday.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS third graf pvs, ``The Investment...$120.43 billion'' to
CORRECT $2.4 million to $240.8 million. Interest rate figures reported
by Donoghue's Money Fund Report are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures
are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>

   Assets of the nation's 454 money market mutual
funds rose $737.2 million in the latest week, reaching a record
level for the third straight week, the Investment Company Institute
said Thursday.
   The rise, to $285.34 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a much bigger rise of $2.2 billion in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group. It was the third consecutive week in which the
assets have expanded to a new high.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 137 institutional funds rose $1.05 billion to $74.99
billion. Assets of 226 general purpose funds fell $240.8 million to
$89.92 billion and holdings in 91 broker-dealer funds dropped $73.7
million to $120.43 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.38 percent from 8.35 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.34 percent from 8.30 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 32
days, compared to 30 days the week before, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
6.28 percent as of Wednesday from 6.26 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, remained at 5.13 percent, unchanged from the week before.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.33
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.30 the
previous week. Yields were 8.58 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.54
percent; 8.67 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.65 percent; and 8.79
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.77 percent.

<HEAD>Limited Partnership Sales Off 23 Percent in 1988</HEAD>

   Federal tax law changes helped cause a 23 percent
drop in sales of public partnerships last year, an industry group
reported Thursday.
   Investors poured $10.5 billion into tax-saving limited
partnerships last year, compared with a record $13.5 billion in
1987, the Investment Partnership Association said.
   In a limited partnership, the liability of the limited partners
in the business is limited to their capital contribution.
Furthermore, partners share all earnings before taxes, whereas the
owners of public corporations _ shareholders _ receive only a
percentage of after-tax earnings as dividends.
   The most dramatic decline in sales last year _ 73.1 percent _
came in of master limited partnerships, which are traded publicly.
Sales of MLPs plunged to $771 million from $2.87 billion the
previous year.
   Fuhrman Nettles, vice president of Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co., a
leading investment partnership research firm, attributed the slump
in MLP sales to federal tax law changes that took effect at the end
of 1987.
   Under the revisions, new master limited partnerships are taxed as
corporations unless they are engaged in energy, natural resources or
real estate. Before the change, only 25 percent of all MLPs met the
exemptions.
   ``MLPs are way down because of the tax law changes,'' Nettles
said. ``Generally, it's made them moderately unattractive.''
   The Investment Partnership Association said sales of real estate
partnerships were off 23.6 percent in 1987, equipment leasing was up
1.1 percent, cable television was down 35 percent and oil and gas
down 55.8 percent.
   Overall sales in limited partnerships for 1989 are projected to
decline slightly, to $10.2 billion, Nettles said.
   He projected that sales in oil and gas partnerships would
increase to $125 million from $89 million but that income from them
would be halved to $250 million.
   Equipment leasing and cable television partnerships would
increase slightly, he said, while commodities partnerships were
unsure because of investigations into alleged corrupt trading in two
Chicago exchanges.
   Despite the 1988 decline, Nettles defended investments in limited
partnerships as currently less risky than the stock market. He also
said limited partnerships remain a good way for companies to raise
equity in an economy heavily financed through debt.
   ``It's been relatively stable compared with new issues of stocks,
which have been up and down,'' Nettles said.

   The stock market swept ahead Thursday in an
advance that carried the Dow Jones average near 2,300 for the first
time since the crash of 1987.
   Trading volume set its fastest pace of the year as buying by
professional money managers overwhelmed a round of selling early in
the session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.18 to
2,291.07, bringing its gain over the past three sessions to 72.68
points. The last time the average closed higher was Oct. 15, 1987,
when it stood at 2,355.09.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
962 up, 510 down and 520 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 212.25 million
shares, up from 183.61 million Wednesday and the heaviest total
since a 216.39 million-share day on Oct. 7, 1988.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 247.76 million shares.
   Analysts said the market drew some support from talk in
Washington of a possible move toward restoring a capital gains tax
break. ``I think the capital gains tax is too high,'' Chairman Alan
Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board told the Senate Finance
Committee.
   Brokers also said the market benefited from catch-up buying by
professionals and money managers unhappy about missing out on the
market's gains since late last fall.
   A brief early decline was prompted by an upswing in credit-market
interest rates. However, brokers said, the pullback attracted buyers
who apparently had been waiting for an opportune moment to buy.
   Big-name computer and technology issues were especially strong.
Digital Equipment, for example, climbed 3[ to 114}. The stock traded
as low as 91} in December before the company's latest quarterly
earnings announcement, which came in above expectations.
   International Business Machines rose 2} to 126; Hewlett-Packard
1\ to 57; Compaq Computer 2 to 69|, and Intel 1 to 25} in the
over-the-counter market.
   DuPont, which announced plans Wednesday to buy back as many as 20
million of its shares, gained 1{ to 100.
   RJR Nabisco led the active list, up { at 95{. Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. was reported to be close to completing financing
arrangements for the buyout of the company by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $22.20 billion, or 0.78
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.27 to 163.60.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.25 to 337.24, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 2.55 at 291.69.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market picked
up 3.06 to 397.09. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 321.42, up 1.92.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Jan. 16, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,070 billion from $3,064.1 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,913.9 billion from $3,904.6 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $783.8 billion from $786.3 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures
   The Fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual
growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is
slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
The Fed has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $127 million,
compared with a decline of $387 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $453 million, down
from $544 million.

   Soybean futures prices took a roller coaster ride Thursday while
wheat advanced and corn was mostly higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Soybeans bounced back in early trading from Wednesday's losses of
up to 18\ cents, then lost ground before the final bell and settled
up 12 cents for March spot contract.
   ``After the market failed yesterday, traders were very jittery,''
said Mickey Luth, soybeans analyst in Chicago for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Confirmation of U.S. soymeal sales to the Soviet Union supported
soybean futures, but hurting prices were expectations of a good crop
from South America, said Luth.
   Wheat and corn prices were boosted by Agriculture Department
moves strengthening the possibility of more sales of those two
commodities to the Soviet Union, said G.H. Miller analyst Jerry
Gidel in Chicago.
   Wheat settled 3 cents to 4\ cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in March at $4.44 a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 1{
cents higher, with March at $2.71} a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 5\
cent lower, with March at $2.20 a bushel; and soybeans were 8} cents
to 13 cents higher, with March at $7.54 a bushel.
   Futures prices for pork were off sharply and cattle traded mostly
lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The markets suffered from concerns about oversupply and mix
demand, said Paul Hare of Linnco Futures Inc.
   But traders said figures from U.S. Agriculture Department
cattle-on-feed reports released after the day's trading sesssion
were near expectations.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .48 cent lower, with the contract
for delivery in February at 72.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.45 cent lower to .07 cent higher, with January at 83.20 cents a
pound; live hogs were .07 cent to .70 cent lower, with February at
42.70 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .82 cent to 1.08
cents lower, with February at 38.82 cents a pound.
   Precious metals prices declined on the Commodity Exchange in New
York.
   The continuing strength of the U.S. dollar, crude oil prices
backing off and no definitive statement from Thursday's OPEC meeting
all weighed on gold and silver prices, said William O'Neill,
director of research in New York for Elders Futures Inc.
   Gold settled $2.60 to $3.60 lower, with the contract for delivery
in January at $403 a troy ounce; and silver was 6.6 cents to 7.2
cents lower, with January at $6.104 a troy ounce.
   Coffee prices moved higher on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange in New York.
   ``We were a little stronger today _ mainly over fears of a
general strike in Brazil over the new economic program would halt
shipments of coffee,'' said New York analyst Kim Badenhop of Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets Inc. ``The market has been very volatile and
it remains very volatile,''
   Coffee settled 1.68 cents to 3.48 cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in March at $1.37.72 a pound.
   Energy futures prices tumbled on the New York Mercantile Exchange
as traders were disappointed over the outcome of a meeting between
OPEC and independent oil-producing nations.
   Crude oil settled 36 cents to 45 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in March at $17.72 a barrel; and hearing oil was 1.34
cents to 1.66 cents lower, with February at 50.87 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
   Dean Witter Financial Services Group said
Thursday it was restructuring its businesses to create separate
divisions for its sales and product development operations.
   The new divisions are Dean Witter Financial, which encompasses
the company's sales and marketing staff and includes branch offices
and trading operations; Dean Witter Capital, which will include
investment banking, asset management and Dean Witter's realty
business; and Discover Card, the firm's credit card operation.
   James Flynn, a Dean Witter spokesman, said the reshuffling was
unrelated to the restructuring announced recently by the company's
parent, Sears, Roebuck and Co. Sears said it would overhaul its
retail business and focus on the consumer side of its financial
service segment.
   The spokesman said there would not be any charges against Sears'
earnings related to the Dean Witter restructuring, nor would there
be any layoffs.
   ``Longer-term it will save us some money,'' Flynn said. ``It
hopefully will make us more profitable.''
   Flynn said the company expected other big investment firms to
similarly restructure their operations.

<HEAD>Du Pont Earnings Up 14 Percent In 1988 Fouth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. on Thursday said
fourth-quarter earnings were up 14 percent over the same quarter the
previous year, while earnings for the year were up 23 percent.
   Net income for the fourth quarter was $500 million, or $2.08 a
share, compared with $439 million, or $1.82 a share, in the same
1987 quarter. Sales for the quarter were up 6 percent at $8.4
billion from $7.9 billion in the 1987 fourth quarter.
   For the full year, Du Pont reported $2.2 billion in earnings, or
$9.11 a share, up 23 percent from $1.8 billion, or $7.39 a share.
Sales for 1988 were $32.9 billion, up 8 percent from $30.5 billion
in 1987.
   ``We are pleased to report a third consecutive year of earnings
growth, reflecting generally strong worldwide demand,'' Du Pont
Chairman Richard E. Heckert said.
   Heckert attributed the earnings rise to strong performances in
petroleum refining, agricultural and industrial chemicals, polymer
products, coal and fibers segments.

<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mead Corp. on Thursday reported its fourth
quarter income rose 31 percent, partly due to the sale of its
Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Company.
   Mead, a paper products and electronic publishing company, also
attributed its financial performance last year to strong demand for
its products in the United States and abroad, high production and
improved margins.
   The company said fourth quarter earnings were $43.4 million or 68
cents a share, compared to $33.2 million or 53 cents a share, during
the corresponding 1987 period.
   For all of last year, earnings were up about 63 percent to $352.7
million, or $5.37 a share, from $216.7 million, or $3.45 a share, in
1987.
   Excluding one-time gains from the sale of assets in both 1988 and
1987, earnings came to $240.8 million or $3.70 per share, compared
with $175.5 million or $2.79 per share for 1987.
   During the fourth quarter, the company made $11.2 million after
completing final arrangements for the sale of Brunswick to
Georgia-Pacific Corp.
   Sales for 1988 climbed 6 percent to $4.5 billion, compared to
$4.2 billion in 1987. Fourth quarter sales, however, were down 2
percent to $1 billion from $1.1 billion a year ago.
   ``Paper and paperboard markets were strong all year,'' said Mead
Chairman Burnell Roberts. ``We operated at near-capacity levels,
backlogs were sizeable and net selling prices improved across our
grade lines.''
   On Dec. 30, Mead acquired the Michie Company, a legal publishing
company with sales of $34 million. The acquisition is expected to
decrease 1989 earnings per share by approximately 25 cents.

<HEAD>PaineWebber Group Profit Drops Sharply</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investment giant PaineWebber Group Inc. said
Thursday its profit plunged 93 percent in the fourth quarter and
fell 41 percent for all of 1988, reflecting a slowdown in the
financial market and onetime costs.
   Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief executive, said sharp
declines in retail and institutional volume in the wake of the
October 1987 crash more than offset improvement in merchant banking
and asset mangement activities.
   He said the firm took steps to improve productivity by cutting
support staff, consolidating offices and shrinking marginal
businesses, and said it would ``continue to rigorously pursue'' that
program.
   PaineWebber said its profit fell to $512,000 in the three months
ended Dec. 31 compared with $7.0 million, or 16 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Payment of preferred stock dividends left the company with a loss
of 20 cents per share in the latest quarter.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 28.7 percent to $696 million from
$541 million a year earlier.
   The latest results included non-recurring expenses of $13
million, including $8 million from a previously-disclosed legal
settlement involving Washington Public Power Supply System
securities and $5 million related to the relocation of the firm's
systems and operations functions to New Jersey.
   For the year, PaineWebber earned $42.4 million, or 58 cents per
share, compared with $72 million, or $2.17 per share, in 1987.
   Revenue for the year edged up to $2.51 billion from $2.44 billion
in 1987.
   The full-year results reflected $20 million in costs due to the
back-office relocation and $20 million due to the WPPSS settlement.

   Congress should consider rolling back increases
in the Social Security tax because the money is being used to hide
the true extent of the federal budget deficit, the General
Accounting Office said Thursday.
   ``A surplus in the Social Security trust fund can lead to
increased national savings,'' and help the economy deal with huge
increases in retired persons after the turn of the century, ``but it
can only do so if the rest of the budget is more or less in
balance,'' said Lawrence H. Thompson, assistant comptroller general,
at a press conference.
   Social Security taxes have been sharply increased under 1983
legislation aimed at making the system financially sound when the
baby boom generation retires early in the next century. The plan
called for building up large trust fund surpluses that could be
tapped later.
   However, the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law counts the Social
Security fund surpluses in its balance sheet, allowing officials to
claim the budget deficit is being reduced even though Social
Security is technically ``off-budget.''
   ``In our judgment, the changes to Social Security enacted in 1983
are not producing the result of lessening the burden of paying for
the retirement benefits of the baby boom generation,'' said the
report by the General Accounting Office, the auditing and
investigating arm of Congress. ``The budgetary reality is that the
payroll taxes are being used to finance the current operations of
government and are masking the size of the on-budget deficit,'' it
said.
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., who requested the report, told
reporters he had already introduced a bill in the new Congress to
take Social Security out of the deficit calculations. If that were
not done, he would support cutting back the tax, as the GAO
suggested, he said.
   ``It was never meant to finance government,'' Moynihan said.
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., in a separate news conference,
called for excluding Social Security trust funds from the deficit
calculations and renewed his call for a national value-added tax
dedicated to reduce red ink.
   Hollings conceded his proposal, similar to a 5 percent national
sales tax, was a radical step and would not stand much chance
without President Bush behind it. But he said there was little
evidence so far that Bush was ready to propose any serious
deficit-reduction measures.
   ``It's total folly to think you can do this without taxes,'' he
said.
   Bush has promised to send his budget proposals to Congress in
mid-February. He plans a speech to Congress on Feb. 9.

<TEXT>
   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Thursday its
profit rose 25 percent in its second fiscal quarter, as higher
selling prices and greater sales volume contributed to a 9 percent
revenue increase.
   The consumer products giant said it earned $325 million, or $1.92
a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31 compared with $261
million, or $1.52 a share, a year earlier.
   Worldwide net sales rose to $5.26 billion in the latest quarter
from $4.83 billion in the second quarter a year earlier.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Procter &amp; Gamble
said its profit rose 18 percent to $725 million, or $4.28 a share,
from $617 million, or $3.61 a share, a year earlier.
   Six-month sales increased by 11 percent to $10.5 billion from
$9.5 billion in the same period a year earlier.
   The company's businesses include laundry and cleaning materials,
pharmaceuticals, and food and beverage products.

   The world may be heading toward a catastrophic
computer failure unless more effective measures are taken to combat
computer viruses, a leading U.S. computer security specialist said
Thursday.
   Professor Lance J. Hoffman of George Washington University said
the virus which affected the Pentagon's ARPANET computer network
last November ``could have had very disastrous consequences for our
society.''
   ``It wasn't Chernobyl yet, it was the Three Mile Island _ it woke
a lot of people up,'' Hoffman told a delegation of Japanese computer
specialists touring this country to assess the virus problem.
   He was alluding to the catastrophic explosion and fire that
wracked a nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine in April 1986,
along with the much less severe partial meltdown which occurred at
the TMI atomic power station near Harrisburg, Pa., in March 1979.
   Hoffman added: ``Unfortunately, I think the Chernobyl may well
happen. We are not out of the woods.''
   Viruses are generally small strings of computer codes that can be
stealthily inserted into software programs, causing a variety of
problems including destruction of computer data and sudden clogging
of a computer's memory with thousands of copies of the virus.
   At the same George Washington University meeting, a staff member
from the Library of Congress disclosed that a virus had been found
last fall within the massive institution's main catalog computer
system.
   ``It didn't cause any damage. It was identified before it could
spread or permanently erase any data,'' said Glenn McLoughlin, a
computer science specialist with the Science Policy Research
Division of the library's Congressional Research Service.
   He said the virus was found after personnel logging onto
computers at the library noticed they had substantially less
computer memory space to work with than they had expected.
   The virus apparently got into the Library of Congress system,
McLoughlin said, through a piece of software obtained from the
University of Maryland.
   ``We don't know whether it was a student at Maryland, or whether
Maryland had gotten it from somebody else. That was simply the
latest point of departure for the software,'' he said.
   The six-man Japanese delegation attending Thursday's briefing was
winding up a 10-day tour of the United States. Their itinerary also
included visits to the San Francisco area, Los Angeles, New York
City, International Business Machines Corp. offices in Purchase,
N.Y., and Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa.
   The group's head, Tomihisa Naito, president of S.G. Engineering
Company Ltd., a Tokyo-based firm dealing with factory automation,
commented that many people in both the United States and Japan still
``do not recognize the importance of protecting computer systems.''
   ``Information in computers has a lot of power nowadays, so people
should be aware of the possibility that that information can be
contaminated,'' he said.
   Edwin B. Heinlein, a computer security consultant from San
Rafael, Calif., who helped arrange the Japanese visit, said he
agreed with Hoffman's assessment that the chances are ``very good''
for a disastrous computer virus incident.
   ``You can make all the laws you want, but only ethical behavior
will keep people from doing bad things,'' Heinlein said. Despite
safeguards now being introduced in many computer systems, he said,
``there's always going to be a loophole, or somebody being able to
take advantage of things.''

<HEAD>UAL's Profit Drops in Fourth Quarter; Delta's Down Slightly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent of United Airlines reported Thursday that its net
income dropped sharply in the fourth quarter from a year earlier,
mainly as a result of accounting changes. Delta Air Lines blamed
rising operating expenses for a 4 percent decline in its profit for
its latest quarter.
   Chicago-based UAL Corp. said its net income for the three months
ended Dec. 31 fell to $20.87 million, or 97 cents a share, from
$209.9 million, or $3.68 a share, a year earlier.
   The company said the per-share comparison isn't meaningful
because of a substantial reduction in the number of shares
outstanding due to a self-tender offer in the first quarter of 1988.
The average number of shares used to compute per-share earnings
dropped to 21,570 in the fourth quarter from 57,100 a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose to $2.22 billion from $2.10 billion
in the year-earlier quarter.
   UAL said the drop in net income for the quarter was mainly due to
a downward adjustment to a previously reported gain on the sale of
the company's non-airline subsidiaries.
   UAL, formerly named Allegis Corp., decided in 1987 to reverse its
travel conglomerate strategy and focus on its core airline business.
The subsidiaries _Hilton International Co., Hertz Corp. and Westin
Hotel Co. _ were sold to fulfill that goal. United Airlines is the
nation's largest carrier.
   The company said additional costs related to the sales of the
units led to a reduction of $24.5 million in the previously reported
gain of $548.5 million.
   For 1988 as a whole, UAL's net income tripled to $1.12 billion,
or $37.87 a share, from $335.1 million, or $6.02 a share, in 1987.
   Again, the per-share comparison isn't considered meaningful.
   Revenue for the year increased 8.2 percent to $8.98 billion from
$8.30 billion the previous year.
   ``Our goal is to position United as qualitatively best, which
will enable us to produce the earnings necessary to fund a prudent
capital spending plan and to provide the security and work
environment our employees so justly deserve,'' said Stephen M. Wolf,
UAL's chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   Atlanta-based Delta said its net income for the second quarter of
its fiscal year slipped to $85.1 million, or $1.73 a share, from
$88.3 million, or $1.82 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   Delta, the nation's third-largest carrier, blamed the decline on
a 12 percent rise in operating expenses in the quarter ended Dec. 31.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 9 percent, to $1.86 billion from
$1.70 billion a year earlier.
   ``While revenues continued to show good growth at over 9 percent
for the quarter, operating expenses rose 12 percent, resulting in
the lower earnings,'' said Thomas J. Roeck, Delta's senior vice
president of finance and chief financial officer.
   ``Increases in salaries and related costs, maintenance expenses
and commissions were the primary factors in this increase in
expenses,'' Roeck said.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Delta's net income
increased 26 percent to $185.1 million, or $3.76 a share, from
$147.4 million, or $3.03 a share, in the same 1987 period.
   Six-month revenue was up 12 percent, to $3.74 billion from $3.29
billion.

   Pop star George Michael will appear in a
television commercial for Diet Coke, featuring original music in a
spot the recording artist had a hand in creating, producing and
directing, Coca-Cola USA said Thursday.
   The announcement came as competition between Coke and its main
compeititor, Pepsi Cola, to sign top entertainers for advertising
heated up.
   On Wednesday, Pepsi announced it had signed the singer Madonna to
star in commercials for its products.
   The 90-second Diet Coke ad with Michael will debut Jan. 30 during
ABC's broadcast of the American Music Awards, the company announced.
Thirty-second previews of the spot were scheduled for broadcast on
cable and broadcast networks beginning Thursday.
   ``Don't expect a typical musical celebrity spot,'' said Michael
A. Beindorff, Coca-Cola USA's vice president for advertising. ``This
commercial represents a new dimension in soft drink advertising.''
   The commercial was directed by British filmmaker Stephen Frears,
and shot on location in New York and Spain. In addition to Michael's
original score, the ad includes excerpts from his song ``Hard Day''
and music performed by the group Gipsy Kings.

   Northwest Airlines will cut back on its
flights from Memphis on May 1 and lay off or transfer as many as 400
workers, an airline spokesman said Thursday.
   ``We are going to make Memphis a more marketable hub and a much
more efficient hub,'' said Northwest spokesman Alan Muncaster.
   The number of Northwest's round-trip flights from Memphis will be
reduced from 165 to about 150, the airline said.
   Muncaster said the carrier will have exact figures on flights and
job cuts by mid-February. Some 2,600 workers are employed in Memphis
by Northwest, which is based in Eagan, Minn.
   Most of the laid-off employees will be ground service workers and
mechanics. Some employees will be allowed to transfer to other
cities, Muncaster said.

<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp., which operates the
nation's largest fast-food restaurant chain, said Thursday its
profit climbed 17 percent in the fourth quarter and was up 18
percent for all of 1988.
   ``McDonald's performance in 1988 reflects several milestones,''
Chairman Fred L. Turner said. ``Systemwide sales exceeded $16
billion, pretax income surpassed $1 billion and we sold our 70
billionth hamburger.''
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, McDonald's said it earned
$151.5 million, or 81 cents per share, compared with $129.6 million,
or 68 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 15 percent in the quarter to $1.45 billion from
$1.27 billion a year earlier. Systemwide sales, which include sales
at franchised restaurants as well as those that McDonald's owns and
operates itself, were up 13 percent in the quarter to $4.14 billon
from $3.68 billion a year earlier.
   Net income for the year rose to $645.9 million, or $3.43 a share,
from $549 million, or $2.89 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 14 percent for the year to $5.57 billion from $4.89
billion in 1987. Systemwide sales increased 12 percent for the year
to $16.06 bllion from $14.33 bllion in 1987.
   For the year, average sales for McDonald's restuarants open at
least one year, a key measurement of fast-food industry performance,
rose to $1.596 million from $1.502 million in 1987.
   U.S. sales benefitted from the introduction of salads in 1987,
growth in breakfast sales and the successful marketing of such
promotions as Monopoly II and games tied to the Olympics, the
company said.

<HEAD>Company Files Revised Plan Of Reorganization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. on Thursday filed
a revised reorganization plan, saying it may sell its flagship Oster
and Sunbeam home appliance divisions to help bring the company out
of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
   The consumer products concern said it has signed a letter of
intent to sell the Milwaukee-based appliance unit, as previously
disclosed, for $260 million to Black &amp; Decker Corp., a maker of
household appliances based in Towson, Md.
   But Allegheny International did not say how the rest of its
estimated $700 million debt would be paid.
   The plan would leave the company in the possession of its own
stockholders. But preferred and preference shareholders would own 82
percent of the stock in the reorganized company, while current
owners of common stock would emerge owning only 18 percent.
   Allegheny International said all creditors will be paid all they
were owed on the day the company filed for protection under federal
bankruptcy laws 11 months ago. Many of those creditors have been
demanding interest and attorney fees.
   A consortium of banks, whose $200 million in Allegheny
International loans are secured by the company's assets, would get
their money back plus $17 million, the company said. But they would
lose much interest that has accumulated since the company declared
bankrupcty.
   In exchange, shareholders would drop a suit charging unfair
pressure from the banks helped speed Allegheny International into
bankruptcy, the company said.
   Under a bankruptcy court ruling, Allegheny International has
until March 31 to convince shareholders and creditors to support the
plan.
