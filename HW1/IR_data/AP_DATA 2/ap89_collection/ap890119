   Honesty is not only the best policy, but
organizers of a new citywide ethics campaign hope their efforts make
it the only policy.
   The Columbus Commission on Ethics and Values, headed by the Rev.
Jeb Stuart Magruder, a former Watergate co-conspirator, on Wednesday
launched its ``Take an Honest Look'' campaign, which is aimed at
prompting discussion and thought on the value of honesty.
   ``How do you do it? We decided we would take one issue at a
time,'' Magruder said. ``Ethics is a minefield in our society. Yet
everybody is getting into it ... saying we need to do something.''
   The privately funded, $75,000 campaign is aimed at residents,
government officials, business people, schoolchildren, and religious
and civic groups. Plans include public forums, school projects,
promotional billboards and television spots, and an honesty test to
be distributed to all askers.
   Magruder, now a Presbyterian minister, was deputy director of
communications in Richard Nixon's administration and deputy director
of Nixon's Committee to Re-elect the President in 1972. He spent
seven months in prison after he admitted destroying records and
committing perjury in the Watergate scandal. He now serves at First
Community Church in suburban Marble Cliff.
   He said his past was the perfect recommendation for his role with
the commission, which was formed in early 1988. And he says he sees
nothing funny in jokes circulating about his participation in the
ethics campaign.
   ``I've dismissed it. There are cynics always,'' he said. ``In a
sense, I'm uniquely qualified to deal with the issues we've talked
about.''
   Magruder was appointed to the commission by Mayor Dana Rinehart,
who has been embroiled in an investigation into allegations that he
sexually assaulted a baby sitter while he was Franklin County
treasurer in 1978.
   Rinehart's case went to a grand jury, but he was never charged.
However, the investigation was renewed last year when news reports
questioned how the initial investigation was handled.
   The mayor, who attended the news conference, said he has heard
cynical comments from some members of the news media and politicians
about his involvement with the panel.
   ``I don't care what people say. Take my personal situation. I
take the attitude of my 15-year-old daughter. They have a problem, I
don't have a problem,'' Rinehart said.
   The honesty campaign's chairman, William Bennett, president of
Bank One, said it won't ``draw conclusions, point fingers or make
judgments,'' but was intended to raise consciousness about honesty.
   The ethics commission was spawned months after the rear door of
an armored car flew open, spilling bags of cash onto a freeway. Many
motorists who stopped to scoop up the flying cash never returned it,
although one man became a local celebrity when he returned $57,000.
   Since then, other stories touting honesty have surfaced. Two
hotel maids, Cathy Dean and Paula Vaughan, received plaques of
appreciation from Magruder and Rinehart on Wednesday for returning
$65,000 they found in a shoebox while cleaning a local motel suite.
   The campaign to raise consciousness about honesty does not target
prison inmates.
   Asked why, Magruder laughed and looked suprised.
   ``I hadn't even thought of it, to be honest with you. That's a
good idea, though,'' he said.

   Federal programs to curb illegally high amounts
of pesticides and other chemicals in the nation's meat supply have
been slipshod and sometimes allowed adulterated food to reach store
shelves, according to an internal audit.
   The report by the Agriculture Department's inspector general's
office said the department's inspection agency _ the Food Safety and
Inspection Service, or FSIS _ has little authority to prevent
pesticide residues from showing up in meat and poultry.
   Accordingly, FSIS has turned to the food industry itself for
cooperation in monitoring levels of chemicals and ferreting out
violations.
   But Agriculture Department investigators found that in some cases
meat and poultry containing too much of these chemical residues were
allowed into the consumer pipeline.
   ``Even when animals were presented to inspectors, (agency)
administrative controls and current policies did not ensure timely
and effective response when pesticide residue was suspected or found
in meat and poultry products,'' the report said. ``As a result, some
adulterated products were allowed to enter commerce.''
   The chief responsibility of FSIS is to ensure that USDA-inspected
meat and poultry products are safe, wholesome and free of
adulterating chemicals. As part of its responsibility, the agency
samples and analyzes edible tissues to see if they meet the federal
standards.
   But the system is far from foolproof, and the agency also
includes efforts to enlighten farmers and processors about the
federal standards and how to comply with them.
   The report, which was completed last November but not given wide
distribution by the department, said FSIS was ``unable to
successfully investigate pesticide violations in 79 percent of the
cases'' reviewed by the auditors. A violation was defined as an
illegal level of chemical residue found in a sample of meat or
poultry.
   Some of the reasons for the lack of success in investigating
violations included:
   _Tracing the illegal residue to the original producer was not
always successful.
   _Follow-up samples from suspected meat were seldom taken, or else
the suspected animals or carcasses were not always retained for
further checking.
   _Documentation of regulatory actions was insufficient.
   Starting in June 1986, when a company signed a memorandum of
understanding with FSIS, it agreed to upgrade its own quality
control procedures, was exempted from routine monitoring by the
agency and placed under a less-intensive monitoring program.
   ``In addition, these companies became eligible to make certain
claims on their product labels concerning (chemical) residue levels
or superior quality control procedures,'' the report said.
   By 1988, this ``verified production control'' program included 11
companies and 34 slaughter plants out of a U.S. total of 1,800
plants. The participating plants had an annual slaughter of about 5
billion pounds, or about 8 percent of all animals slaughtered last
year.
   In all, the agency is responsible for inspection in more than
7,000 meat and poultry slaughter and processing plants.
   The USDA investigators visited 96 federally inspected meat and
poultry plants and conducted research at the agency's national
office, three regional offices, three field laboratories and five
USDA-accredited laboratories.
   One of the major problems uncovered was in identification of the
original farmer, feedlot operator or other livestock producer that
have been found to be in violation of the federal residue levels.
   Investigators found that FSIS was unable to locate producers in
12 of 28 pesticide violation cases reviewed.
   In one case, regional office personnel did not act on all the
information that was available, not even when tags on a 6-year-old
cow provided information on the name of the livestock auction market
where the cow was sold.
   The agency contacted the auction market and was told cow's
previous owner was unknown, so the case was closed, the report said.
Federal regulations, administered by another USDA agency, the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, require such cows to be
identified and records maintained.
   But FSIS ``made no attempt to contact'' the other agency, and the
regional official in charge of residues said that staff people
didn't take time to check further.
   The report recommended that the agency seek legislation for
mandatory identification of the source of all animal species
slaughtered for domestic food consumption. However, FSIS responded
that such a move should be directed to policy-makers, not the
regulatory agency itself.
   Lester M. Crawford, FSIS administrator, said that historically
the agency has pursued animal identification as a related part of
the residue testing program.
   ``We recently were successful in obtaining a swine identification
program outside of the legislative route, and would strongly support
similar identification for the other species which come under our
jurisdiction,'' Crawford said in a response to the report.

   Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the only black in Bush's Cabinet, brings
to HHS a long-time desire to improve health care for the poor.
Sullivan has focused his efforts as president of the Morehouse
School of Medicine in Atlanta on training doctors, especially
minorities, who are willing to establish family practices in rural
and inner-city areas.
   The 55-year-old doctor is a personal friend of Bush and his wife,
Barbara, who was named to the medical school's board of trustees in
1983.
   Sullivan's selection was nearly derailed after he was quoted in
an Atlanta newspaper as saying he supported a woman's right to seek
an abortion, though he opposed federal funding for the procedure.
   His statement inflamed anti-abortion groups and he later said he
opposed abortion in all cases except in cases of rape, incest and
when the mother's life is in danger, mirroring Bush's view.
   Since the abortion flap, Sullivan has said little about his
priorities for HHS, the largest of all the federal departments. HHS
includes Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security as well as the
Public Health Service and the Food and Drug Administration.
   Sullivan graduated with honors both from Morehouse College in
1954 and Boston University Medical School in 1958. He has taught
medicine at Harvard, Morehouse, the New Jersey College of Medicine
and Boston University.
   In the 1970s, Sullivan worked to establish the Morehouse medical
school and when it separated from Morehouse College in 1981, he
became president. It is one of the three predominantly black medical
schools in the country.

   The top issue on James D. Watkins' agenda as energy
secretary-designate _ repairing and cleaning up the nation's nuclear
defense plants _ is one for which his military background gives him
special preparation.
   Watkins, 61, studied nuclear reactor engineering in 1958 at the
Oak Ridge, Tenn., National Laboratory. He taught at naval nuclear
training centers in 1960, and four years later took command of the
nuclear-power attack submarine Snook.
   The Oak Ridge lab is one link in the Energy Department's
nationwide network of nuclear weapons plants. The system has been
crippled recently by safety and technical problems that forced the
shutdown of the only reactors that make tritium, a radioactive gas
vital to the production of nuclear warheads.
   Watkins capped a 41-year Navy career with a four-year stint as
chief of naval operations, the service's top job. He retired in 1986.
   In October 1987, Watkins took over as chairman of the
presidential commission on AIDS that recommended legislation to
prohibit discrimination against victims of the deadly disease.
   Watkins graduated from the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., in
1949, earned a master's degree at the Naval postgraduate school and
then decided to specialize in nuclear submarines.
   Watkins was a protege of the late Adm. Hyman Rickover, the father
of the modern nuclear Navy. He became commander of the Pacific
Fleet, based in Honolulu, and in March 1982 was named chief of naval
operations by President Reagan.

   Early in William J. Bennett's tenure as secretary of education,
the National Education Association asked him what he would do if he
had a magic wand to wave over American schools.
   ``No drugs _ none, zero, out, gone, disappear,'' replied the
blunt-spoken educator.
   As Bush's choice to be the nation's first drug czar, it will fall
to Bennett to find a way to win the war on drugs.
   Bennett, 45, was a headline-grabbing education secretary who
railed against rising college costs and slipshod standards. He also
spoke out on topics from defense of Western civilization courses to
AIDS.
   He left Reagan's Cabinet in September to write, open a small
policy shop called the Madison Center, and deliver lectures at
reported fees of up to $15,000-per-appearance.
   Bennett obtained a Ph.D in philosophy from the University of
Texas at Austin and a law degree from Harvard. He taught at several
campuses and eventually ran the National Humanities Center in

   Carla Hills won swift praise when she was named as the nation's
top trade negotiator. But there also was grumbling.
   ``I had hoped that we'd have someone from the business world who
had extensive international experience,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, said after the 54-year-old Washington lawyer was named U.S.
trade representative.
   But Hills' fans say she is fully up to whatever comes her way.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., calls her ``a tough negotiator'' and
Clayton Yeutter, the outgoing trade representative, praised her
``strong international background.''
   Hills has been underestimated before.
   Her 1975 nomination by President Ford as secretary of housing and
urban development quickly came under fire.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., groused that experience is too
seldom valued in the nation's capital, chortling that the Washington
Redskins had once lost 16 yards on a play devised by Richard M.
Nixon.
   ``I can promise you that I won't be sending in any football
plays,'' Hills shot back. She went on to win wide plaudits in the
post.
   She graduated with honors from Stanford, where she captained the
tennis team, and was 20th in her class of 167 at Yale Law School.
She served as an assistant attorney general for a year in the Ford
administration and has practiced law in Los Angeles, where she
co-founded her own law firm.

   Texas oilman Robert A. Mosbacher Sr. takes over the Commerce
Department without any government experience but pledging to keep
communication between Washington and the business community ``open
and continuing and even building.''
   Bush turned to a longtime friend and stalwart GOP fund-raiser in
selecting Mosbacher to round out his economic team, saying the
61-year-old businessman would ``bring his tremendous energies to the
task of promoting U.S. exports abroad.''
   Mosbacher has raised money for the president-elect in every
campaign since Bush ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1970.
   Mosbacher, whose fortune in oil, real estate and ranching is
estimated at more than $200 million, founded Mosbacher Energy Co.
and is an avid sailor in his off-hours.
   He amassed his fortune after leaving his home in White Plains,
N.Y., in 1948 at age 21 to make his way in Texas. He first met Bush,
who also ventured out from New England to Texas as a young man, in
the late 1950s.
   Mosbacher's primary responsibilities at Commerce will include
work on opening foreign markets to U.S. goods, administering the new
U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and presiding over the 1990
national census.
   Mosbacher received a bachelor's degree in economics from
Washington and Lee University in 1947.

   As conciliatory as his predecessor was pugnacious, Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos appears to represent the ``kinder, gentler
nation'' promised by Bush.
   The 62-year-old son of a Texas cattle foreman, a holdover from
the last months of the Reagan administration, has been busily
mending many of the fences bashed by former Education Secretary
William Bennett.
   ``We're all on the side of the angels,'' Cavazos said last Sept.
21, his first day on the job. ``So we have no problems.''
   The first Hispanic to serve in the Cabinet is a Democrat who in
the past criticized proposed Reagan education cuts. He was president
of Texas Tech University and its medical school when President
Reagan tapped him as education secretary.
   A soft-spoken political novice, he has generally kept a low
profile. He is respected by the education community and won Senate
confirmation 94-0.
   Cavazos has vowed to fight for ``the best funding possible'' and
has pledged to focus federal services on high-risk children. His
other priorities include cutting the dropout rate, improving
teaching and boosting spending on the Pell Grant program for
disadvantaged college and vocational students.
   Cavazos, who has a doctorate in physiology, was dean of the Tufts
University medical school before moving on to Texas Tech.

   The biggest change Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has noticed
at the Justice Department since he ran the criminal division 11
years ago is the agency's increased international focus.
   The attorney general says one of his top priorities is to
streamline and centralize international operations that focus on the
rise of international drug trafficking, money laundering and
terrorism.
   Thornburgh's successful prosecutions of organized crime, public
corruption and drug trafficking while U.S. attorney for western
Pennsylvania led to his 1975 appointment by President Ford as
assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division.
   In 1978, Thornburgh was elected to the first of two four-year
terms as Pennsylvania governor. His calm handling of the Three Mile
Island nuclear power plant crisis just weeks after he took office in
1979 won him widespread acclaim.
   The 56-year-old attorney general was a member of his party's
liberal wing early in his political career, opposing the Vietnam War
and supporting New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller for president in
1968.
   But like fellow Yale graduate George Bush, Thornburgh has moved
slowly to the right of the political center.
   Thornburgh was appointed by President Reagan last summer to
restore the Justice Department's image and moral after the lengthy
special prosecutor's probe of his predecessor, Edwin Meese III.

   John Goodwin Tower is a former U.S. senator and political insider
who for years has coveted the job he's about to take on for George
Bush _ secretary of defense.
   The 63-year-old Tower, a diminutive man in stature but described
by friends as ``willing to play hardball anytime,'' is a Texas
native who fought as an enlisted sailor during World War II and then
went on to become a defense expert in the U.S. Senate.
   At the time he retired in 1985 after 24 years on Capitol Hill, he
was the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and had
helped Ronald Reagan push his military buildup through Congress. He
earlier had made a name for himself as an expert on the details of
weapon systems and defense policy and as a conservative critic of
the Soviet Union.
   Tower wanted to head the Pentagon under Reagan, but lost out
first to Caspar W. Weinberger and then in 1987, to Frank C. Carlucci.
   After retiring from the Senate, Tower became a high-priced
Washington consultant _ with major defense contractors on his client
list _ but interrupted that life to serve as an arms control
negotiator for Reagan and then as the head of the presidential panel
that investigated the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Known as a pragmatist who prefers backroom negotiating to public
posturing, Tower has been unable to avoid the glare of publicity in
his private life. Twice divorced, he has been the subject of rumors
about womanizing raised by his second wife during divorce
proceedings and about excessive drinking.
   Tower has dismissed such assertions as ``rumors and innuendos.''
   Set to become the nation's 17th secretary of defense, Tower has
said he is convinced defense spending can be reined in and a strong
military still maintained. He has denied his previous work in the
Senate and with defense contractors will prevent him from canceling
weapon programs.

   Samuel Knox Skinner has two roles related to his new position as

   Skinner, 50, has also been U.S. attorney in Illinois and has long

is credited with helping Bush win the key state last November.
   Skinner, one of a handful of Bush Cabinet members who have not
held high-profile Washington posts, directed the Bush campaign in
Illinois in both 1980 and last year.
   He built a reputation for toughness as top deputy to Thompson
when the governor was U.S. attorney and created the office's Special
Investigation Division, leading the prosecution of former Democratic
Gov. Otto Kerner, who was convicted in 1973.
   Since 1984, Skinner has been chairman of the Regional

   Elizabeth Hanford ``Liddy'' Dole, President-elect Bush's choice
to head the Labor Department, is half of one of Washington's most
powerful couples _ a Harvard-trained lawyer whose charm has won her
bipartisan popularity in the nation's capital.
   Mrs. Dole, 52, was a Democrat when she came to Washington two
decades ago, but switched to an independent and then Republican as
she climbed the ladder of success, holding several jobs in the Nixon
and Ford administrations and becoming an active campaigner in the
presidential campaigns of her husband, Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole of Kansas.
   President Reagan chose her as transportation secretary in 1983.
She served for four years and left with her popularity intact
despite criticism that during her tenure air and highway safety
suffered.
   Organized labor had a few disputes with Mrs. Dole while she was
at transportation, but labor leaders have voiced approval of her
selection, if only for the fact that they believe her political
ambitions will lead her to seek a higher profile than those who were
passed over for the job.
   At the Labor Department, she will be involved in Bush's promised
plan to expand day care availability and likely will serve as the
administration's chief spokeswoman when Congress debates raising the
minumum wage and in a legal fight over the government's plan to drop
a ban on home work in the apparel industry.

   During his 11 years in Washington, William H. Webster has been
called upon to cleanse the reputations of two tarnished but vital
federal agencies, first the FBI and since 1987, the CIA.
   After Bush won the election last November, critics of Webster
pressed for his ouster as director of Central Intelligence.
   But Bush, who was cast out as CIA director by newly elected
President Carter in 1977, announced on Dec. 7 that he had ``total
confidence in Webster'' and that his tenure at the spy agency was
``open-ended.''
   Webster, 64, was appointed CIA director in the wake of
revelations that the late William Casey had subverted agency
operations to run his own ``off-the-shelf'' intelligence network,
consisting in large part of CIA operatives but working outside the
oversight of Congress.
   Webster, who was born in St. Louis and trained as an attorney,
still prefers the title ``judge,'' which he earned on the Eight
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   He was summoned to Washington in 1978 by President Carter to take
over the FBI. At the time, the FBI was still tainted from the
48-year directorship of J. Edgar Hoover, who threatened politicians
with secret files and ordered domestic spying against those with
whom he disagreed.
   When Webster left the agency nine years later, he had largely
restored the image of the bureau and moved it into new areas of
investigation, such as white collar crime and drug trafficking.

   Brent Scowcroft, the new national security adviser, is a seasoned
White House hand who has differed sharply with President Reagan on
such key strategic issues as ``Star Wars.''
   George Bush has asked for a review of strategic policy. Although
neither he nor Scowcroft have spelled out the new U.S. strategy, it
could differ from Reagan's in important respects.
   Scowcroft, appointed by Reagan to head a blue-ribbon panel that
studied plans for a mobile intercontinental ballistic missile,
recommended development of the single-warhead Midgetman missile,
which would be based on trucks on military reservations in the
Southwest.
   However, the Pentagon budget that Reagan sent to Congress on Jan.
9 dropped all money for the Midgetman in favor of the 10-warhead MX
missile, which would be based on rail cars.
   Scowcroft also has urged that Reagan's ``Star Wars'' program to
develop an anti-ballistic missile system be traded away in arms
talks with Moscow.
   And he criticized the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force treaty
that Reagan signed with the Soviets in December 1987. Scowcroft said
the pact helped denuclearize Europe, a step considered beneficial to
the Kremlin because of its advantage in non-nuclear forces.
   Scowcroft, 63, was born to a Mormon family in Ogden, Utah,
graduated from West Point in 1947, and rose in the Air Force to the
rank of lieutenant general.
   Scowcroft began a five-year stint at the White House as military
aide to President Nixon in 1972-73, and was deputy to national
security adviser Henry A. Kissinger in 1973-75. Scowcroft served as
national security adviser in 1975-77 after Nixon resigned in 1974,
Gerald Ford was president and Kissinger became secretary of state.
   He was one of three members of a commission that investigated the
Iran-Contra affair in 1987.

his career in the bureaurcratic trenches. From 1970 until 1977, he
served in the Nixon and Ford administrations in policy positions in
the departments of defense, justice, commerce, state and health,
education and welfare.
   Darman, 45, entered the Reagan administration in 1981 as a top
aide to James A. Baker III, who was then the White House chief of
staff and is now Bush's choice for secretary of state. He followed
Baker to the Treasury Department when Baker moved there in 1985.
   At treasury, Darman was a key figure in developing a plan to
drive the value of the dollar lower as a way of reining in the huge
budget deficits.
   Known for his keen intellect and his political skills, Darman
resigned the No. 2 job at treasury in 1987 to take a position with
Shearson, Lehman Bros. investment banking division.
   Last summer, he joined the Bush campaign, serving as a stand-in
for Michael Dukakis during Bush's practice debates.

   This year's five inductees into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame _ Dion, Otis Redding, the Rolling Stones, the
Temptations and Stevie Wonder _ are a gathering of the soulful side
of the '60s.
   ``Tonight we're all on our best behavior,'' said the Stones' lead
singer, Mick Jagger. ``And we're being rewarded for 25 years of bad
behavior.''
   Jagger was among four present and former Stones who attended
formal induction ceremonies Wednesday night at the Waldorf-Astoria,
where the three previous induction banquets have been held.
   ``I got in! I got in!'' an exuberant Dion exclaimed. ``This is a
major moment for me. I'm conscious and breathing and right here with
you and enjoying every minute.''
   Dion said music to him was a way to ``share my feelings, love,
hates, thoughts, perceptions. It is a way of connecting.''
   Pete Townsend, who presented the award to the Rolling Stones,
said the Stones had influenced his own British band, The Who.
   ``The Stones were a rock band to begin with. The Who became a
rock band partly because of the Stones,'' Townsend said.
   He dismissed suggestions that the Stones are outdated.
   ``I think the debate between Mick and Keith (Richards) is the
same debate we're (The Who) having _ are we capable of doing
anything new of consequence? Whether the Stones do anything new
doesn't matter to me. They have a fantastic collection of stuff.''
   Jagger and Richards, who have fallen out in recent times,
attended the ceremonies along with ex-Stone Mick Taylor and his
replacement, Ron Wood.
   In accepting the award, Jagger hinted that there may be more
Rolling Stones music to come.
   ``Jean Cocteau said Americans are a funny people,'' Jagger said.
``First you shock them, then they put you in a museum. We're not
quite ready to hang up the number yet.''
   Right now, the 20 artists or groups named to the Hall of Fame
since 1986 are honorees without a home _ ground has not yet been
broken for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame archives and museum in
Cleveland, scheduled to open in 1992.
   ``I hope they can get down to building the phantom temple of
rock,'' Jagger said.
   David Ruffin, former lead singer with the Temptations, said he
will always consider himself a part of the group.
   ``That's something I'm very proud of _ to have been a part of the
group and I always will be,'' Ruffin said.
   To be inducted, artists must have recorded more than 25 years
ago. All of this year's fourth honored group had records released
before Jan. 1, 1964. They were elected by more than 150 performers,
producers, writers, record executives and broadcasters for their
contributions to, or influence on, the course of rock 'n' roll.
   The Rolling Stones' induction includes the original five members,
Jagger, Richards, the late Brian Jones, Bill Wyman and Charlie
Watts, plus Taylor who replaced Jones, Wood who replaced Taylor and
the late pianist-arranger Ian Stewart, who made an important
contribution to the group's sound. At the beginning, the Stones were
immersed in ``raunchy'' American blues and rhythm 'n' blues.
   The group went on to record songs by Jagger and Richards and had
major hits including ``Satisfaction,'' ``Jumpin' Jack Flash,''
``Street Fighting Man'' and ``Honky Tonk Women.'' They have been
hailed as the world's greatest rock 'n' roll band.
   The soul group the Temptations have original members Otis
Williams, Melvin Franklin, Eddie Kendricks, the late Paul Williams
and David Ruffin inducted, plus Dennis Edwards, who replaced Ruffin
in 1968. Later replacements are not included. The Temps' major
breakthrough was in 1965 with ``My Girl.'' Later hits include
``Cloud 9'' and ``Papa Was a Rolling Stone.''
   Stevie Wonder was born Steveland Morris Hardaway on May 13, 1950,
in Detroit. His first record, ``Fingertips, Part 2,'' became a hit
when he was just 13. Wonder, who was born blind, has written one
imaginative piece of music after another in his soulful, pop and
experimental concept albums. He opened for the Stones on their 1972
tour. His hits include ``My Cherie Amour'' and ``You Are the
Sunshine of My Life.''
   Soul singer Otis Redding was born Sept. 9, 1941, in Macon, Ga.,
and died in a plane crash on Dec. 10, 1967. He was traveling with
the group the Bar-Kays to save travel expenses, and the plane
crashed en route to Cleveland, killing everyone aboard. Redding had
interrupted his tour to cut a record which was in the mail to stores
when he died. It was ``(Sittin' on) the Dock of the Bay,'' his
biggest hit.
   Dion was born Don DiMucci on July 18, 1939, in New York City. He
and three friends formed a group in high school in 1958, taking the
name the Belmonts from a Bronx street. After recording such hits as
``A Teenager in Love,'' ``Where or When'' and ``In the Still of the
Night,'' Dion went solo. His biggest hit was ``Runaround Sue'' in
1961.
   The Hall of Fame also honored three early influences on rock 'n'
roll, the late blues singer Bessie Smith, the soft rhythm 'n' blues
vocal quartet the Ink Spots and the gospel singers the Soul Stirrers.
   Sam Cooke didn't change his style, just the type of lyrics, when
he went into secular singing in 1956 after six years singing lead
with the Soul Stirrers. He was replaced by Johnnie Taylor, who also
went on to soul stardom.
   Producer Phil Spector, famous for his ``wall of sound,'' is being
inducted in a non-performing category.

   Something there is about an actor who loves
the act of giving, so it was nice to find a bunch of ``Santa
Clauses'' running around the set of the new James Bond movie,
``License Revoked.''
   Timothy Dalton ``has been very giving as an actor,'' said Robert
Davi, forgetting for the moment that his villainous character spends
the last part of the movie trying to grind Dalton-Bond into cocaine
dust.
   ``I don't think you can create anything if you don't give,''
returned Dalton, who manages to give Davi's character a hole in the
head.
   ``He's very professional, very focused,'' said Carey Lowell of
Dalton, shortly after saving Bond from a fate worse than coke.
``It's better than working with somebody who doesn't give a damn.''
   Seriously, now.
   ``I would loathe a concept of work in which people are competing
with each other,'' said Dalton. ``I think it is a two-way process.
It is a game where you throw something at somebody and they throw it
back at you.''
   In other words, these actors say, this is how they work. They
have nothing to give but themselves, and that can be scary. But if
an actor holds back, if nothing is given, nothing can be thrown back.
   ``It's probably true that some actors see it as a competition,
but it seems very ungenerous to attempt to deny to another actor the
tools with which to work,'' Dalton said. ``I think if you look at
any really good actors, you'll find them all very giving.''
   Lowell, whose face has decorated the covers of Vogue and
Mademoiselle, understands that concept as one of the differences
between modeling and acting.
   ``It's different from modeling because you don't have to give to
the camera. You give to the actors instead,'' she said. And if you
give only to the camera? ``In a film, if you're static it shows
immediately. It's difficult.''
   To hear these people talk, you'd think making moving pictures was
fun, not long hours of work, intense concentration, weird
situations. Just what does an actor think about while hogtied on a
conveyor belt, waiting to be ground (almost) to magnesium dust
(that's what they use as a stand-in for cocaine).
   ``When you're in the thick of it you have to think of what to do
in the scene. You've got to be on form and on key and
concentrated,'' said Dalton.
   The effort to maintain concentration is why he has a reputation
for being difficult for outsiders to talk to on the set.
   ``If you can't get it right you don't get a moment to do it
again,'' he said. ``You just don't get a moment to do it again.''
   Now let's back up. The film is ``License Revoked,'' and it is due
for release in the summer. James Bond loses his license to kill and
goes off the reservation to avenge his friend, CIA agent Felix
Leiter, who gave his leg to some sharks with the help of ...
   Franz Sanchez (Davi), an evil drug lord modeled a little bit on
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, de facto ruler of Panama who has been
indicted on drug trafficking charges in the United States. He is
foiled with the help of ...
   Pam Bouvier (Lowell), a former pilot for the CIA who worked with
Leiter and who saves Bond and helps gift-wrap Sanchez at Mexico
City's Churusbusco Studios under the direction of John Glen.
   Dalton, 42, is a classically trained actor who has established
his ability to play all kinds of roles _ everything from
Shakespeare's ``Richard II'' to the male lead opposite Mae West in
``Sextette.''
   That range is the envy of Lowell and Davi, who would like to have
the opportunity to show that they, too, can change their spots.
   ``Unfortunately, I always have to play a beautiful girl. Now I
want to do something less stylish,'' the 27-year-old Lowell said.
   Davi, 35, would like to go up the style scale, not down, and to
that end he's trying to push the envelope on the Bond villain bit.
   ``This guy could be a friend who you think it'd be nice to have a
drink with, but after the last sip he stabs you. It kind of makes
him fun to play,'' said Davi.
   ``I want to make my mark in film,'' he said. ``I want to be an
international star. I want to get the girl without putting a gun to
her head. I'm looking for Mister Good-Guy.''
   Dalton thinks they've both got a chance:
   ``Everyone has to be good, because you want a good movie. It
would be stupid and destructive not to be a creative, giving actor.
It's how we work together.''

   If Robert Davi ever gets tired of being a
villain on film, he can always try opera. That's how he got his
start in show biz, and when he talks about a character it can sound
a bit _ well, operatic.
   ``I was a high baritone, loved Verdi,'' said Davi, who plays drug
lord Franz Sanchez in ``License Revoked,'' the latest James Bond
movie due out in the summer. ``I sang for the Lyric Opera of Long
Island.''
   Davi, 35, did that when he was 19. He even studied with Tito
Gobbi, one of the great voices of Italy.
   ``If I was still singing I wouldn't be doing any of this now,''
he said, waving at a Bond set gloomy with smoke from the fire that
destroys the villain's laboratory.
   ``I wouldn't be smoking cigars or drinking. And I'd get out of
this air (Mexico City's world-record pollution). I wouldn't even be
talking. I would be totally crazy.
   ``After I'm established as an actor I'd like to spend six months
and work on the voice. Now the voice is getting the black mark.''
   Timothy Dalton, who plays Bond, had proposed that Davi play
Sanchez as an opera buff: ``I suggested to him that he had to find a
moment where he sang a bar or two. Probably at an odd moment right
after or just before he killed somebody, whistle or sing a couple of
bars.''
   ``We thought about it when we first met,'' Davi said. ``Timothy
wanted me to try something, but I decided I better not. I did the
same thing in `Goonies,' sort of played a frustrated opera singer. I
didn't want to do the same thing as I did in the Spielberg film,
which was full of pirate ships and fantasies. I want to be
remembered for something else in this film.''
   But Dalton said he didn't see why Davi should worry about that,
``if it's a good idea.''
   ``All actors have good ideas. But they're not always germane to
the piece,'' said Davi, more diplomatic than Sparafucile, the hired
killer of Verdi's ``Rigoletto.''
   But Sanchez, ``seductive, charming, and totally immoral,'' as
Davi conceived him, might be able to hold his own with many another
opera bad guy.
   ``The most difficult was when I walked through that house in
Acapulco that was supposed to be the house I owned. A $30 million
house. I don't have $30 million,'' Davi said.
   ``You know, a lot of actors when they play something like that
you see them in the house but you don't really believe that they own
it. I had to go through that house and feel like I owned it.''
   Then he bursts into a snatch of ``Va, Tosca,'' a solo in which
the evil Scarpia boasts that he's infected Tosca's heart with
jealousy by fooling her into thinking her boyfriend is fooling
around.
   Watch out, Puccini.

<HEAD>Kangaroo for Dinner? Australian Conservationists Object</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kangaroos may soon end up on dinner
plates in New South Wales, Australia's most populous state. Animal
welfare groups are hopping mad.
   They contend few Australians will want to feast on their national
symbol but that tourists might.
   Conservationists called the decision ``disastrous'' and
potentially dangerous because kangaroos carry a host of diseases.
   ``Paul Hogan (the comic star of ``Crocodile Dundee'') is luring
American tourists to Sydney, but all they are likely to see is a
bloodbath,'' said Sue Arnold of Australians for Animals, the
country's largest wildlife conservation group.
   ``Kangaroos are shot by helicopter, poisoned, snared and used for
pet food as well as an export industry. Now they're being offered
for domestic human consumption. How can they survive?'' she said in
an interview.
   Hogan, hailed by the tourist industry for his ``throw another
shrimp on the barbie'' commercials that brought a record 2 million
visitors to Australia's bicentennial celebrations in 1988, has a new
series to be screened in the United States in February.
   In the commercial, as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald,
Hogan says that ``God had a sense of humor'' when he desposited in
Australia ``the famous giant hopping mouse'' _ the kangaroo.
   Tourism Minister Graham Richardson said the commercials are
expected to contribute to a 20 percent growth in tourism this year.
Five million tourists are expected by the year 2000, said Bill Gray,
Manager of the government-funded Tourism Australia.
   Officials said a decision Jan. 6 to harvest kangaroos for human
consumption will not endanger wildlife.
   The News South Wales health minister, Peter Collins, said the
program is for farming kangaroos, not depleting wildlife stocks. The
decision reverses a longstanding ban in New South Wales, of which
Sydney is the tourist gateway.
   Kangaroo meat already is consumed in the states of South
Australia and Western Australia. Its is described extremely lean,
full of protein and somewhat gamy, not unlike venison.
   Collins said his department would ensure that kangaroo meat is
safe to eat, but Arnold and others questioned how the state
government planned to farm the creatures and maintain a standard
that makes them fit for consumption.
   Australia's population is 16.5 million. The government's National
Parks &amp; Wildlife Service estimates the kangaroo population at about
15 million. An annual culling quota is about 3 million, with the
meat used for pet food and skins turned into such goods as wallets
and purses for export.
   ``What other country in the world slaughters its national
symbol?'' said Richard Jones, a member of the New South Wales
Parliament who was elected in 1987 on a platform of animal welfare.
   Arnold said kangaroos carry a range of diseases, such as
salmonella, tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis and hydatid cysts, a worm
that can be fatal.
   Farmers regard the kangaroo as a pest. The Greenpeace and Animal
Liberation organizations, both supporters of Australians For
Animals, said the decision represents a victory for the farm lobby.
   The Canberra Times, a newspaper in Australia's capital, said the
kangaroo industry is in chaos.
   It said there is compelling evidence of widespread illegal
shooting and few controls on the transportation of skins and
carcasses inter-state.
   Only licensed professional shooters are supposed to hunt
kangaroos but conservationists and others maintain the government
regulation is loosely enforced.
   ``At the end of the day, the only conclusion to be drawn is that
the government controls on the kangaroo industry are worthless,''
the newspaper said in an editorial.
   Christine Townsend, spokeswoman for Animal Liberation, called the
decision a disaster.
   ``It simply commercializes our wildlife,'' she said.

   A scare in Britain over food poisoning from eggs
has led Agriculture Minister John MacGregor to announce new controls
for the poultry industry that he said will be the world's strictest.
   Inspections of stockfeed plants will be doubled and plants with
contaminated premises will not be allowed to ship their feed, he
said Wednesday in a House of Commons written reply.
   MacGregor promised new laws to give greater control over imported
feed and British hatcheries and breeding flocks. Producers will have
to register and submit their flocks, products and premises to
regular bacteriological checks.
   MacGregor also announced a national campaign to educate the
public in food hygiene in the home ``to reduce the incidence of food
poisoning generally.''
   After reports that eggs had caused food poisoning, with
slaughterhouse waste used in stockfeed a possible suspect, junior
Health Minister Edwina Currie said most egg production was infected
by salmonella bacteria.
   Eggs sales slumped, farmers began killing chickens and Mrs.
Currie quit under fire on Dec. 16.
   The government promised farmers $34 million compensation and
launched a national advertising campaign to restore public
confidence in eating eggs.
   The government's chief medical officer, Sir Donald Acheson, said
last week that salmonella in eggs is still a serious health problem
but ``only a very few eggs are infected.''

   Airplanes can trigger lightning bolts when
lightning is not occurring naturally, suggesting that airplanes have
a greater chance of being struck by lightning than previously
believed, new studies show.
   The studies also show that many lightning rods and protective
devices are inadequate to handle the rapid surge of electrical
current when a lightning bolt strikes, said E. Philip Krider of the
University of Arizona in Tucson.
   ``You need to have a protective system that is much faster than
we thought even 10 years ago,'' Krider said Wednesday at the annual
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Krider and his colleagues have for the first time been able to
trigger, direct and study lightning bolts in electrified clouds.
   Those studies have shown that current in a lightning bolt can
surge 400,000 amps in a millionth of a second, about 20 times faster
than researchers had thought possible, Krider said.
   ``Most distribution arrestors _ the kind you put on power lines _
are probably not fast enough'' to protect the lines from lightning
damage, he said.
   Many lightning rods, likewise, cannot carry current to the ground
quickly enough, so there is a danger that the current will spark
wildly in dfferent directions from the tip of the lightning rod.
   Krider and his colleagues trigger lightning bolts by launching
into electrified clouds a three-foot-long rocket trailing a wire
connected to the ground.
   The rocket disturbs the electrical charges in the cloud, begins
to spark at its tip and then triggers a lightning bolt down the wire
to the ground.
   The researchers have learned that about three-quarters of the
spacecraft that have been hit by lightning have triggered the
lightning bolts themselves by a similar process.
   A large fraction of thick, layered clouds are electrified and
could provide the right environment for commercial aircraft and even
small private planes to trigger lightning bolts, Krider said.
   ``The triggered lightning hazard was previously unsuspected,
because the cloud was not making any lightning,'' he said.
   Researchers do not yet know how to identify clouds that provide
the environment for this triggered lightning, Krider said.
   ``If we understood what kinds of clouds have this potential, we
might be able to say `avoid this situation,''' he said.
   Lightning can pose a serious hazard to aircraft by disturbing
their electrical systems or blowing out their engines, Krider said.
   Krider is part of a team of scientists studying how to reduce the
chances that lightning bolts will strike and damage the space
shuttle.
   They are trying to devise a way to monitor the electrification of
the clouds so launches can be postponed when conditions are ripe for
the shuttle to trigger lightning bolts.
   The researchers also are trying to devise ways to make the
shuttle more resistant to lightning damage if it is struck, he said.
   One of the problems underlying the research, he said, is that
physicists don't understand how electricity builds up in clouds.

   For the first time since World War II,
Albania is playing host to a meeting of senior diplomats from the
six Balkan countries.
   Albania's holding of the three-day meeting of the countries'
deputy foreign ministers is widely seen as another strong indication
that the country is emerging from its long self-imposed isolation.
   The meeting, which opened Wednesday, was attended by
representatives from Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece
and Albania, the official Albanian news agency ATA said in a report
monitored in Vienna.
   The gathering comes a year after six Balkan foreign ministers
pledged in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, to boost economic cooperation and

   Police are going to crack down on pedestrians

``is almost like a birthright'' to many pedestrians.

crosswalk or two.
   ``Our efforts are aimed at education, not enforcement.''
   Cannon said he has ordered officers to issue warnings to
jaywalkers as part of a program to educate pedestrians that the
practice can be dangerous.
   Motorists who block intersections at traffic lights will be
issued written warnings, and the program will include tighter
enforcement of illegal parking violations.
   Violators could face fines of $32.50.

<HEAD>Two Charged with Conspiring to Sell Plane Parts to Iran</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two businessmen were arrested
Wednesday and charged with conspiring to sell spare parts for the
F-14 Tomcat fighter jet to Iran, the U.S. Customs Service said.
   George DeMar, 58, an independent pilot from East Quogue, and Paul
Amara of North Babylon, an aircraft parts broker, were accused of
negotiating with an undercover Customs agent posing as a
representative of Iran interested in buying spare parts for the
fighter, said Gary Hillberry, special agent-in-charge of Customs'
New York office.
   In exchange for $1 million, the men allegedly agreed to provide
the parts, a plane and pilot and pay the cost of shipping the parts.
   Hillberry said the undercover agent suggested shipping the parts
through Shannon, Ireland, to cover their trail.
   The men were arrested after the agent met with them Wednesday
morning at Suffolk County Airport in Westhampton Beach and verified
that the parts were on the plane.
   ``The plan was to take off today after we gave them a certain
amount of good-faith money,'' Hillberry said.
   Hillberry said the agent approached the men after the Customs
Service learned that they wanted to sell the parts, Hillberry said.
   ``They were interested in brokering the parts. We told them we
were Iranian representatives and they picked the ball up from
there,'' Hillberry said.
   The parts were originally purchased as surplus from the
manufacturer by a middleman, who, in turn, sold them to the men
arrested Wednesday, Hillberry said.
   The middleman was not involved in the scheme to sell the parts to
Iran, Hillberry said.
   Export of spare parts for the F-14 to Iran is illegal without a
license from the State Department, according to the Customs Service.
Moreover, Hillberry said, it is not possible to obtain such a
license because ``we're not dealing with Iran.''
   A complete inventory of the parts or the quantity involved was
not immediately available. Hillberry said the parts on the plane
included equipment for loading ammunition in the jet's 20mm canon
and hydraulic assemblies for the jet's landing gear.
   DeMar and Paul Amara were arrested at the airport, U.S. Attorney
Charles Rose said. They were arraigned in federal court in Brooklyn
on charges of conspiracy and violating the Arms Export Control Act.
   If convicted, they face fines of up to $250,000 and a maximum of
15 years in prison.
   Federal Magistrate Carol Amon released DeMar on $1 million
personal recognizance bond; Amara was released on $250,000 bond.
   Customs agents seized the twin-engine turboprop on which the
parts were loaded. Hillberry said the German-made Hansa plane was
capable of making the flight to Europe. He would not identify the
plane's owner, who he said was unaware of the scheme when he leased
the jet.

   Promising mayhem but no bodily injury,
magicians Penn and Teller are bringing their award-winning Broadway
show to Philadelphia, where they performed on the streets during the
late '70s.
   During what Penn Jillette described as ``the world's most
efficient press conference'' Wednesday, he said ``horrific'' things
would occur during the ``Penn and Teller'' show at the Shubert
Theater.
   While he spoke, Teller, his quiet partner of 14 years, was
submerged in a locked tank of water.
   The fast-talking Penn got a little carried away describing the
comedy team's ascent to fame and only took notice of the time when
Teller began banging on the glass tank, splashing reporters,
photographers and his partner.
   ``Time just flies by,'' Penn said as he glanced at his watch. He
assured the reporters, ``It's OK. There's a signal he would give if
he were reallly in trouble.''
   Penn opened the tank after a mere five minutes and 47 seconds had
elapsed.

   Jimmy Carter and Jerry Ford say they don't know
why they got such bad press while in office and President Reagan has
played so well in the media.
   ``Presidents Nixon, Johnson, Ford and I had bad relations with
the press. Reagan had good relations,'' said Carter. ``Why, I don't
know.''
   The two former presidents took part in a discussion at Columbia
University on Wednesday on ``The Press, the Presidency and the First
Hundred Days.''
   Carter said he spent weeks trying to deflect attention from a
story that a ``killer rabbit'' had swum out to his boat as he was
fishing and that he had to beat it back with oars.
   ``How can you control something like that?'' Carter asked. The
rabbit story, he said, ``gave an image of an incompetent president
who could not even protect himself against a rabbit.''
   He said Ford ``was the best athlete ever in the White House'' but
he was dogged by stories about his supposed clumsiness. ``It hurt
him politically,'' Carter said.
   Ford said news people who accompanied him on ski trips to Vail
fell as much on the slopes as he did ``but nobody took pictures of
them.''
   The images are hurtful, he said, but ``it's part of what they
think the public wants.''
   Ford and Carter agreed that when it comes to relations with the
news media, George Bush will find Ronald Reagan a hard act to follow.
   Reagan was treated with kid gloves by the press, Ford said. And
Carter thinks Reagan got away with staying aloof from tough issues _
``a tribute to his acuity.''

   New York investor and takeover artist Saul P.
Steinberg has pledged $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania,
the largest single gift in the Ivy League School's history, Penn
President Sheldon Hackney said.
   ``He has been a champion of the university for many years, and
his latest bold step is pivotal in our campaign to strengthen Penn's
position in the front rank of America's universities,'' Hackney said.
   The Wharton School, the university's business school, will get
$15 million and the school of arts and sciences $10 million.
   Steinberg, who is chairman and chief executive of Reliance Group
Holdings Inc., received a bachelor's degree in economics from
Wharton in 1959.
   He is chairman of the Wharton School's Board of Overseers and has
been instrumental in supporting a strategic plan that will create
five professorships, establish other positions for young professors
and boost funding for the Steinberg Conference Center and for new
academic programs.
   Administrators of the arts school have decided to invest their
share of the gift in Penn's English Department for faculty and

<HEAD>Study Shows Lots of Garlic And Onions Cut Cancer Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Garlic and onions can put a crimp in your
social life, but they also could provide unexpected protection
against cancer, according to a study published by the National
Cancer Institute.
   The study compared foods eaten by stomach cancer victims with the
diet of healthy people in Linqu, China. Researchers found that the
strong-smelling vegetables ``can significantly reduce the risk of
stomach cancer.''
   Published this week in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, the study says researchers used questionnaires to compare
the dietary habits of 685 patients with stomach cancer with those of
1,131 other people, matched by age, gender, occupation and
education, who had no diagnosed cancer.
   People in the control, or cancer-free, group each year consumed
at least 25 andsometimes more than 50 pounds of allium vegetables, a
genus which includes onions, garlic, leeks, chives, ramps and
scallions.
   The cancer patients generally ate less than 25 pounds of the
vegetables.
   The study also found that the risk of stomach cancer declined as
the habitual consumption of such vegetables increased. In other
words, the more onions and garlic you eat over a lifetime, the less
your chances of stomach cancer.
   ``Persons in Linqu tended to be exposed to mild doses of allium
vegetables over long periods, likely beginning in childhood,'' the
study said. ``Our study suggests that all or part of such exposure
has resulted in a reduction in stomach cancer risk starting at an
early age ... and continuing throughout life.''
   The anti-cancer effects of onion-like root vegetables have been
suggested in studies dating back to the 1950s. A 1979 study, for
instance, found a reduced amount of stomach cancer among residents
of a Georgia county famous for growing vidalia onions. A study in
Greece showed that gastric cancer patients usually ate fewer fresh
vegetables, including onions, than those who were cancer-free.
   ``Several experimental studies have suggested that compounds in
allium vegetables can protect against cancer in laboratory
animals,'' the NCI Journal study said. It said a variety of studies
have shown that chemical compounds extracted from onions and garlic
tend to reduce, alter or prevent cancer in laboratory rats, mice and
hamsters.
   But the study said the precise anti-cancer element in allium
vegetables has not been pinpointed.
   The Chinese study found that ``reduced risks were associated not
only with intake of all allium vegetables combined, but also with
individual allium foods, suggesting that these vegetables have a
common chemical component (possibly allyl sulfides) that is
protective in humans.''
   Researchers also suggested that since garlic has been shown to
have antibacterial properties, it could help prevent stomach cancer
by blocking the conversion of nitrates to nitrites, a compound
associated with developing stomach cancer.
   The statistical study was conducted by a National Cancer
Institute team led by W.J. Blot, and by researchers from the
People's Republic of China.
   Interviews for the study were conducted between 1984 and 1986 in
Linqu County, part of the Shantung Province in northeast China. This
area has one of the highest stomach cancer mortality rates in China.

   George Bush received a big boost during the
campaign when the Boston police union voted to endorse the
Republican over hometown favorite Michael Dukakis. This week, Bush
is returning the favor.
   Sixty Boston police officers plus spouses arrived in Washington
on Wednesday along with members of the New York Police Department
and Springfield, Mass., police for inaugural activities, compliments
of the Presidential Inaugural Committee.
   The committee paid for an estimated 315 officers and spouses to
come to Washington via Amtrak and stay for two nights at a local
Holiday Inn, according to Michael Dee, a committee official. He said
no estimate was available no how much the travel and accommodations
would cost.
   ``It's payback time,'' said Robert Guiney, head of the 1,500
member Boston Police Patrolmen's Association. ``I know they
appreciate what we did. They wanted the Boston police down here.''
   Delegations from all three departments will march in the
Inaugural Parade on Friday.
   Every officer attending the inauguration also was given the
opportunity to buy coveted tickets to an inaugural ball, Dee said.
   The Boston union voted 51-0 on Sept. 21 to endorse Bush over the
Massachusetts governor. Bush came to Boston the next day and held a
well-publicized news conference during which he hammered away at his
campaign theme that Dukakis was soft on crime. The following week,
Bush went to Springfield to accept the endorsement of the
Springfield police union.
   The Boston police endorsement, which served to point up the
Republican's attack on the state's much-criticized furlough program,
embarrassed Dukakis in his own back yard.
   ``I've been told by a lot of people in the Republican Party that
it was a turning point in the election,'' Guiney said at Union
Station as officers from all three departments arrived in Washington.
   The Inaugural Committee reserved a special Amtrak train, which
Boston and Springfield police boarded at 6:15 a.m. in Boston. New
York City officers joined the ``Presidential Inaugural Express'' at
11 a.m.
   The officers went from Union Station to the Lincoln Memorial for
the opening inaugural ceremonies.

   Donald Trump's quest to acquire Eastern
Airlines' northeastern shuttle for $365 million cleared a key
regulatory hurdle as the U.S. Department of Transportation gave
tentative approval to his operating plans.
   The Transportation Department on Wednesday said it has concluded
that Trump's proposed plans are financially sound and his key
personnel possess the managerial and technical ability to carry them
out.
   ``Essentially, we've tentatively approved a fitness certification
for Trump to operate the Trump Shuttle,'' said Hal Paris, a
Transportation Department spokesman. ``We are allowing any
interested parties who have objections to file them within the next
15 days. Then there's a seven-day period to respond to any of those
objections.''
   The Federal Aviation Administration still must certify that the
planned shuttle operation is safe before the deal is final.
   Texas Air Corp., Eastern's Houston-based holding company, has
been trying to sell the profitable shuttle, arguing that it needs
cash to survive.
   A federal judge approved the sale last month over objections of
labor leaders who had challenged it as a union-busting tactic. The
carrier's unions argue that the shuttle sale is part of a plan by
Texas Air to dismantle Eastern Airlines, whose 30,000 employees are
represented by three militant unions.
   ``There is no doubt that an ongoing struggle has and will
continue to exist between Eastern and its (unions),'' U.S. District
Judge Barrington D. Parker wrote in his opinion. ``However, the
court feels that equally plausible is the idea that management is
seeking to rebuild the company and place it on a sound financial
footing.''
   The unions said they would appeal the decision.
   The shuttle makes hourly flights among Boston, New York and
Washington. Trump announced an agreement to purchase it on Oct. 12,
1988.
   He plans to rename the service the Trump Shuttle.
   Trump already owns casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., and a
helicopter service that flies between the gambling mecca and New
York City.

   Take it from a man who knows, moving never gets
easier _ even when you're president-elect.
   ``It's a real wasteland out there this morning,'' George Bush
told a group of teachers Wednesday, referring to the chaotic scene
he had left behind at the official vice presidential residence in
northwest Washington.
   Later, addressing a Republican National Committee luncheon, Bush
said he was giving his wife Barbara ``a little elbow room'' as she
was in the throes of moving out of the residence.
   ``She's getting tough around the house,'' Bush joked. ``See a
half-filled crate and she puts me to work and she's mean and tough
and ugly about it. She doesn't show any understanding. And so she's
not here today.''
   ``I don't care if I see her for another 48 hours, because I know
there'll be another crate and she'll say: `Move this one over here.'
Getting tired of that. After all, I got big responsibilities being
put on my shoulders,'' he added, to laughter from the crowd of 550.
   The Bushes, their children and grandchildren are spending two
nights at Blair House, the government guest house, before moving
into the White House on Friday. Mrs. Bush, it should be noted,
packed hundreds of boxes herself.

   A favorite pastime this week is comparing the Bush style to the
Reagan style, and speculating on what it all means for the nation.
   ``It's the difference between old money and new money. What that
means is that the rug is just as expensive, but now the dog is going
to wet on it,'' humor writer P.J. O'Rourke told CBS reporter Bob
Schieffer.
   Letitia Baldrige, a renowned hostess and etiquette writer,
temporarily forgot her manners when Schieffer asked her about the
consequences of Nancy Reagan's departure. ``Maybe there won't be
quite as many anorexics in this country,'' she said.
   Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team, offered
a somewhat gentler view at an Inaugural Salute to Women in Business.
With Barbara Bush in the White House, she told the primarily female
audience of 400, ``we can age gracefully.''
   The changing of the guard has already claimed its first casualty:
Mrs. Reagan's hairdresser. Robyn Wier is trying to drum up business
via the fax machine, urging prospective inauguration week customers

   When presidential candidate Bush referred to ``a thousand points
of light'' in accepting the GOP nomination last August, most
Americans shook their heads and wondered what he meant. But
fireworks designers had a different reaction.
   ``We said to ourselves, `That sounds like a great fireworks
show,''' said Philip Butler of Fireworks by Grucci.
   The Gruccis, veterans of two previous inaugurations, got their
chance to display ``an exclusive designer shell in a barrage to
highlight this theme'' at the inaugural opening Wednesday evening at
the Lincoln Memorial.
   While the crowd on the ground waved thousands of flashlights,
points of light repeatedly exploded in the sky, pearl-like flashes
lasting 30 seconds each against the darkening sky. Said Butler with
satisfaction: ``Most shells last no more than four seconds.''

   The animal-rights activist who allegedly placed a
bomb on the grounds of a surgical company was indicted Wednesday on
federal charges of possessing two additional pipe bombs.
   Fran Stephanie Trutt, 33, had previously been charged in a
federal complaint. Prosecutors with the U.S. attorney's office in
Brooklyn presented the case to a grand jury, which returned the
indictment.
   Miss Trutt's arraignment on the indictment had not yet been
scheduled, said Ann Driscoll, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Andrew
Maloney.
   Miss Trutt was arrested Nov. 11 in Norwalk, Conn., after police
said she placed a radio-controlled pipe bomb packed with roofing
nails on the grounds of U.S. Surgical Corp. They said she apparently
opposed the company's use of live, anesthetized dogs in surgical
equipment demonstrations.
   Miss Trutt, who was charged with attempted murder and possession
of explosives by Connecticut police, is in custody on $500,000 bail.
   After her arrest, authorities searched her apartment and found
two live pipe bombs inside a suitcase in her bathroom, court papers
allege.
   If convicted of the federal charges, she faces up to 10 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.

   A. LeConte Moore's role at the presidential
inauguration won't be apparent unless terrorists attack, the parade
floats collapse, thieves steal the 10,000-gallon cowboy hat or wind
tears the 20- by 40-foot flag off its staff.
   As insurance man for the Presidential Inaugural Committee, Moore
hopes none of these remote possibilities will ruin the event,
protected with special policies arranged by his company, New
York-based brokerage Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos. Inc.
   ``I don't want claims. I don't want people to get hurt,'' Moore
said in an interview. ``I don't want PIC to be sued. I don't want
the insurance companies to have to pay the claims.''
   Although the insurance companies can't blame him if there are
claims, Moore said he wants to stay on their good side.
   ``You can always find another client; you can't always find
another insurance company,'' said Moore, vice president of the
company's Entertainment &amp; Leisure Division.
   Moore is securing policies from approximately 25 other insurers,
including the Gulf United Corp., the Chubb Group and the American
International Group. The complete insurance package is said to be
costing the committee between $300,000 and $400,000.
   Moore declined to specify the price tag but described it as ``an
incredibly cost-effective deal, considering the terrorism right
now.''
   General liability insurance, Moore's biggest concern, would cover
personal injury in the event of a terrorist attack. Liability covers
other contingencies as well, ranging from collapsed spectator
bleachers to food poisoning at a post-inauguration cocktail
reception.
   Moore declined to specify how much coverage is provided, saying
disclosure could invite frivolous lawsuits.
   ``You can get lawyers hovering like wolves around a carcass,'' he
said.
   What happens if Bush is injured? ``I doubt the president would
sue his own committee,'' Moore said.
   If inaugural history is any indication, things can go wrong.
   Longtime Washington residents still recall when Army troops had
to shovel Pennsylvania Avenue after a snowstorm struck on the eve of
John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961.
   Frigid temperatures in 1985 drove President Reagan's inauguration
indoors and canceled the parade down Pennsylvania Avenue.
   That decision may have prevented lawsuits over frostbite. But the
inaugural committee had to offer to return more than $840,000 to
17,500 parade ticketholders. The event was then insured for
liability and property, but not cancellation. Moore has changed that
now.
   ``The PIC wants to be able to say `It's too cold out, we cannot
let the parade go on,''' he said.
   Aside from a few fender-benders from parade-related accidents, no
claims were filed in 1985.
   The inaugural gala is expected to gross about $9 million from
television advertising and ticket sales. The committee will use the
proceeds to help defray inaugural expenses, including the insurance.
   Aside from terrorism and accidents, the committee also is insured
in case the broadcast goes awry, either because of technical
problems or because somebody says something on the air that invites
a lawsuit.
   ``If someone's libeled or slandered during the broadcast or in
the audience, and this is a roast, PIC wants to know how they can
avoid losses,'' Moore said.

the court voted 8-1 Wednesday that the U.S. Sentencing Commission
rules or ``guidelines'' are constitutional.
   Lawmakers and judges joined in praising the decision, which means
many federal criminals will have to be resentenced because trial
judges had refused on constitutional grounds to follow the
guidelines after they took effect in November 1987.
   Sentences will stand for those federal criminals who went before
judges adhering to the guidelines. People sentenced under the
guidelines usually spend more time behind bars.
   ``By eliminating widespread disparity in sentencing practices,
the guidelines make the punishment for crime not only fairer but
also more certain,'' Thornburgh said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the decision ``clears the
way for long-overdue reform of the current chaotic and unfair
federal sentencing procedures.''
   Kennedy, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
added: ``Congress stands ready to cooperate with the commission, the
Justice Department and the courts to make the new guidelines work.
It is time to end the gross disparities in sentencing that permit
too many convicted offenders to avoid any real punishment.''
   Commission Chairman William W. Wilkins Jr., a judge on the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., said Wednesday's
ruling makes the disputed guidelines ``the law of the land, and the
barriers to full implementation have been lifted.''
   The decision has no effect on defendants convicted and sentenced
in state courts.
   Although more than 150 judges struck down the guidelines, a
greater number of judges had chosen to implement them.
   The commission was created in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,
legislation aimed at eliminating what some called unjustified
disparities in sentencing.
   The law enpowers the commission, whose members are appointed by
the president to six-year terms, to tell federal judges what
sentences should be imposed for certain crimes.
   The judges must follow the commmission's guidelines, which
generally stiffened the prison time federal convicts are required to
serve.
   The commission eliminated parole and curtailed credit for good
behavior.
   In other matters Wednesday, the court:
   _Unanimously struck down a West Virginia county's practice of
taxing some property at up to 35 times as much as neighboring
comparable land.
   The justices, however, said their ruling does not affect the
ironically named ``welcome stranger'' property tax systems under
which many states impose dramatically higher taxes for newly
purchased property.
   _Ruled, 8-0, in a California case that labor unions may not fire
elected local union officials for disagreeing with the parent
union's policies.
   _Heard arguments in an important civil rights case from Alaska,
Washington state and Oregon over the role of statistics in proving
that an employer's subjective decisions are illegally discriminatory.

   The Transportation Department is putting a
60-day hold on its plan to cut back subsidies that allow airlines to
operate unprofitable routes in rural areas, saying it took the
action to give Congress time to look for more money.
   Department officials cited a $6.6 million budget shortfall last
month in proposing to sharply curtail the ``Essential Air Service''
program. Under the program, the federal government subsidizes
flights to and from 155 small cities that would probably not
otherwise have air service because the routes are not moneymakers.
   DOT originally said it hoped the cuts could take effect on March
1, following a public comment period. But the plan was swiftly
attacked by lawmakers, and the department said Wednesday it yielded
``in response to requests from members of Congress.''
   ``Because the shortage is only $6.6 million, I thought there was
a very good chance that Congress would restore the money to avoid
the loss of airline service,'' Rep. Bob Davis, R-Mich., said
Wednesday. ``The major problem was the timing.''
   Now that the program has been given a 60-day reprieve, Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said, ``I believe that additional funds can be
found within the budget, and it would be premature for the
Transportation Department to disrupt essential air service without
exploring the opportunities for supplemental funds.''
   Despite the postponement of the cuts, Sen. Jay Rockefeller,
D-W.Va., said he still planned to introduce a resolution asking the
department to keep the subsidies intact until Congress can come up
with the $6.6 million.
   He and Byrd said the subsidies were critical to West Virginia's
economic growth.
   But DOT warned that action must come soon because the longer the
program proceeds at current financing levels, the harder it will be
to achieve savings later.
   ``If the funding issue is not resolved by early June, a notice to
all subsidized Essential Air Service carriers will be necessary
indicating that no funds will be available beyond mid-July,'' the
department said.
   The department had earlier proposed four likely plans for coping
with the cuts. One of them, considered the harshest by some, would
cut 53 cities out of the program. One-third of those cities are more
than 100 miles from the next nearest airport.
   States that would have been hit particularly hard by the cutbacks
included Arizona, Arkansas, California, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan,
Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
South Dakota, Texas and West Virginia.

   The day is going to start earlier and last
longer at the White House after President-elect Bush takes over, the
president-elect's spokesman says.
   Marlin Fitzwater, who is President Reagan's chief spokesman and
will also be Bush's press secretary, broke the news Wednesday.
   ``The vice president is going to start his work schedule at 8
a.m., and he also has breakfasts at 7:15 a.m. and things like
that,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater, who was Bush's press secretary as vice president
before becoming Reagan's spokesman, said he expects the new
president's working day to last until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m.
   Reagan usually has his first appointment of the day at 9 or 10
a.m. and seldom stays past 5 p.m., often leaving the Oval Office in
mid-afternoon.
   Fitzwater said John Sununu, who will be Bush's chief of staff,
had indicated he would meet with his senior staff daily at 7:30 a.m.
and meet with the president shortly after that.
   Reagan's meetings with his chief of staff have been ordinarily
either at 9 a.m., 9:30 a.m. or 10 a.m.
   Fitzwater said he, too, will be coming to work a half-hour
earlier than his present 7:30 a.m.

<HEAD>Kuwait To Cut Back On Reflagged Vessels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait will remove six of its oil tankers from
the U.S. registration that gave them a military umbrella during the
Iran-Iraq war, but five others will still fly the American flag and
have all-American crews by early next year, administration officials
say.
   The decision to cut back reflects a desire by the Kuwaitis to
save on the cost of maintaining all-American crews, as the ships
must have, combined with a wish by the United States and Kuwait to
maintain stability in the region despite eased tensions.
   The Kuwaitis had received a waiver of the crew requirement when
they first decided in 1987 to reflag tankers to obtain American
military protection inside the Persian Gulf. The waiver allows the
Kuwaitis to sail the vessels with only two Americans on board _ the
ship's master and the ship's radio officer.
   ``Those five ships are going to remain under the U.S. flag
indefinitely and will have to be fully manned by U.S. crews,
providing approximately 250 additional jobs for American seamen,''
one defense source said Wednesday.
   The sources said that in order to provide the Kuwaitis a year to
come into compliance with ship-manning laws, the Defense Department
requested _ and the Coast Guard approved on Tuesday _ a special
``National Defense Waiver'' good through Feb. 11, 1990.
   The officials insisted Wednesday the issue of how many Kuwaiti
ships would remain under the U.S. flag had turned solely on the
question of compliance with the manning laws.
   ``We told them we had protected their ships, we weren't leaving
the gulf, we'd like to see the ships stay under our flag, but we
expected them to comply with the manning law,'' said one
administration official.
   ``They countered they were willing to keep the ships under the
U.S. flag but didn't want to put all-American crews on all of them.''
   The sources insisted they knew of no deeper motive for the
Kuwaitis' decision beyond that of paying the higher salaries
expected by American crews.
   ``There's no deep meaning here from a political standpoint,''
said one official. ``It's quite obvious that nothing is happening in
the Persian Gulf now with the Iran-Iraq truce, so they don't need
any U.S. protection.''
   ``But they are sensitive to perceptions on Capitol Hill,'' said
another source. ``They don't want to turn their back on us after all
of our help and then see the truce break down and the tanker war
erupt again.''
   ``And from our standpoint, this promotes stability in the area
and our relationship with Kuwait,'' said another official.
   The Reagan administration agreed to allow Kuwait to re-register
the 11 tankers under the U.S. flag in order to extend them
protection against Iranian attack. Kuwait is a key ally of Iraq and
as a result had seen its tankers increasingly come under Iranian
attack.
   The five ships that will remain under the U.S. flag include four
oil product carriers _ the Surf City, Chesapeake City, Sea Isle City
and Ocean City _ and the supertanker Bridgeton.

<HEAD>Discrimination Alleged in Customs Service</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A class-action lawsuit accusing the U.S.
Customs Service of discriminating against its 1,800 Hispanic
employees is taking some of its cues from a recently successful
action against the FBI.
   The class-action suit Wednesday by the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund alleges that the Customs Service under
Commissioner William von Raab has removed almost all Hispanics from
key management posts and barred others from entering the executive
ranks.
   MALDEF says the customs service ``is employing an informal and
unfairly discriminatory promotion system to circumvent the formal
merit promotion system'' at the expense of the Hispanics employed at
the agency.
   A federal judge in September ruled in favor of Hispanic FBI
agents who alleged that the bureau promoted Hispanic agents too
slowly, assigned them less-desirable jobs and gave them little
recognition for their successes. Damages have yet to be determined
in the FBI case.
   ``We did take our lessons from the FBI suit,'' MALDEF associate
counsel Mario Moreno said in an interview.
   Customs service spokesman David Hoover said Wednesday the agency
would have no comment while the lawsuit is in court.
   The suit names Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, von Raab and 25
other customs service and Treasury Department officials.
   It alleges employment discrimination against Hispanic customs
service employees in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964.
   Hispanic employees represent over 11 percent of the agency's work
force of some 15,600 people, yet there are no Hispanics in the
senior management ranks, said MALDEF's suit.
   It alleges that ``since 1980, the commissioner of customs has
actively sought to reduce the number of Hispanic employees at upper
management levels.''
   Nine years ago, customs employed nine Hispanics in top
supervisory posts, but now the agency employs just three, or 1.5
percent of the people at that level, the suit said. There are no
Hispanics in the senior executive service, which includes regional
commissioners, assistant commissioners and other executive level
posts, the suit said.
   Eighty-three percent of Hispanics at the customs service are
concentrated in three regions, the Southwest, Pacific and Southeast,
and Hispanics in those regions aren't considered for promotion in
areas where there is no large Hispanic population. Non-Hispanic
customs employees are brought in from other areas to fill managerial
slots, restricting promotional opportunities, it added.
   Hispanics with criminal enforcement responsibilities are assigned
regularly to wiretap duty and undercover assignments based on their
Spanish-language skills, which limits their promotional
opportunities, the suit said.
   Assignments to wiretap monitoring are involuntary, involve
unusually long hours and often take an agent away from the home
office, the suit said. But once the Hispanic agents have developed
the case with that long, tedious wiretap work, it is turned over for
conclusion by other, non-Hispanic agents, the suit said.
   Hispanic agents in the FBI suit made similar allegations about
burdensome wiretap duty and desirable cases being taken away from
them.
   In 1988, there were 19.4 million Hispanics in the United States,
representing over 8 percent of the population.

   Six former U.S. Marines are in Vietnam on a
sentimental visit to remember dead comrades and to help get rid of
mines they planted two decades ago. Here is a report on their
journey by George Esper, who spent 10 years covering the Vietnam War
for The Associated Press and is on his second reporting trip there
since.

<DATELINE>KHE SANH, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-one years ago in what is now only
a heap of red dirt, U.S. Marines were crying out, ``Corpsman!
Corpsman! We've got wounded here!'' as hundreds of artillery shells
rained in on them.
   It was here at Khe Sanh that U.S. Marines withstood a 77-day
North Vietnamese siege in the winter and spring of 1968 in a classic
battle of the Vietnam war, suffering more than 200 men killed and
1,600 wounded out of a garrison of 5,500.
   Six of their former comrades, some of whom fought here, returned
Tuesday to walk the same battlefield still strewn with shell casings
and other leavings of war and to honor the men who died.
   Standing in the fog-shrouded valley, in what was once the center
of the base, restricted to a red dirt road because of la man to give his
life for
another man,'' said Frank Noe, 40, of Stoughton, Mass., who served
at Khe Sanh during the start of the siege. He then led the others in
The Lord's Prayer.
   ``God bless all of those who gave their life at Khe Sanh,'' Noe
said after the brief ceremony. ``It's just a shame so many guys lost
their lives not only here but all over the country.
   ``This was a hellhole, a pretty scary place to be. I sort of get
that eerie feeling I had the last time I walked through this place.
It brings back a little of that, especially with all this fog
around.''
   All six were deeply moved as they visited Khe Sanh, one of a
string of bases at which they served just below what was once the
demilitarized zone that divided Vietnam into North and South at the
17th parallel during the war. The country was reunified in 1975 when
with the Vietnamese communists' victory.
   Gen. William C. Westmoreland, the former commander of U.S. forces
in Vietnam, once characterized Khe Sanh as an important cork that
bottled up North Vietnamese troops from moving eastward the south's
populated coastal regions.
   The Americans abandoned Khe Sanh after the siege was lifted and
engineers from the 11th Marines, a battalion in which five of the
men revisiting the site served, bulldozed the base.
   The battalion planted 100,000 land mines, and the six Americans
came to Vietnam to help get rid of those that remain concealed. They
do not carry any equipment, but wanted to point out likely sites
where mines may be concealed.
   ``This is a trip for me and all the other veterans to put this
time in our lives to rest and say the land's at peace, the war's
over, there's reconciliation between Vietnamese and Americans,''
said Mike Wallace, a 41-year-old farmer from Langdon, Kansas.
   ``I think we feel true peace now,'' said Gene Spanos, a
39-year-old police lieutenant from Rosemont, Ill., who organized
Vietnam Revisited.
   ``If we could just say this to every Vietnam veteran who served
in Vietnam that, `Peace is here, peace should be at home amongst us
all.' They should have their own peace. There's no more war here.
It's over with.''
   The Marines were on an unofficial goodwill mission of their own
that they planned for more than a year. In inspecting their former
bases, they found that land mines they planted more than 20 years
ago to protect them from attack still posed a danger to civilians.
   ``This is just a moment in our life we're always going to
treasure, a chance to come back,'' said Spanos.
   ``It unloaded some excess baggage that I didn't really know I was
still carrying around,'' said Nate Genna, a 41-year-old maintenance
man from Boston. ``We did confirm some serious problems do exist
here as a result of our actions and we want as much attention
brought to them as possible.''
   William Johnson, a 41-year-old electric sign maker from
Manchester, Conn., said it was a good feeling for him to return
without any fear of danger.
   ``I feel some reward by this trip,'' said Johnson. ``I feel I
have first-hand information about what's happening here, the chance
of people being injured in certain areas. These are questions I've
had. It's people that had nothing to do with the war that are
suffering. It's 20 years later, there's no war going on and children
who weren't even around during the war are exposed to danger.''
   Some of the men picked up Khe Sanh war remnants as mementos to
take home, including a rusted American helmet.
   As Johnson left the base, he picked up a piece of scrap metal,
the remains of a mess kit, and cradled it in his hands.
   ``Scrap metal,'' he said as he gazed at it, ``but this was
somebody here 20 years ago, a soldier eating.''
   Perhaps one of his fallen comrades.

   The neatly dressed children at Dunbar Elementary
School in riot-torn Overtown were back, walking in straight lines on
the breezeways and playing on the well-trimmed grounds behind barbed
wire-topped fences.
   A certificate on the office wall proclaims Dunbar ``safe and
smiling'' _ a contrast to the experience of many of its pupils
during their day off Tuesday.
   The Spanish-design, pastel-peach building on Miami's NW 20th St.
in the heart of the Overtown neighborhood seems an oasis in the
middle of the housing projects, rundown apartments and overgrown
lots in the heart of the city.
   After the first night of violence sparked by the police shooting
of an unarmed black motorcyclist Monday, six schools were closed. On
Wednesday, Dade County reopened schools, including Dunbar.
   Nine-year-old Tiffany Dukes said Wednesday she sat on her porch
and watched as her neighborhood smoldered with anger during her day
at home.
   ``They was shooting in the air and they had caught some stores on
fire,'' she said. ``They was burning cars in the street.''
   This part of Overtown didn't look like a riot scene Wednesday,
but a few signs gave it away. Broken glass littered the roadway near
the school, a torched grocery store smoldered and two barricades
marked the police perimeter five blocks away. Two policemen sat in
front of the school, talking quietly.
   The damage in Overtown was far worse in the 1982 riot, when
injured people sought refuge in the Dunbar cafeteria, said 4th grade
teacher Walter Allen.
   The school has been untouched this time.
   Tiffany said she was happy to be back at school. When asked what
was causing problems, Tiffany quickly referred to the dead
motorcyclist.
   ``The police shot him for nothing,'' she said.
   Tamika Facey, 11, said the rioting ``was so disgusting. We were
really scared.''
   Sherelle Poole, also 11, said she ``felt bad about what was
happening, about the disturbance. I was sad. I was scared.''
   Attendance was low Wednesday at Dunbar, but teachers said parents
may not have known schools were open again.
   Five hundred children showed up, instead of the usual 1,200.
   ``Five hundred kids,'' Principal Maybelline Truesdell said,
laughing. ``This is heaven! I could love this .... but not under
these circumstances.
   ``On the morning announcements I told them how happy we were to
see them. Then I told them that if they had any questions or
concerns, their teachers would discuss it with them,'' she said.
   But she said none of the children had come forward to talk about
any difficulties.
   ``The parents have done an excellent job of explaining the
situation _ as much as it can be explained,'' she said.
   Fourth-grader Marcine Hill, didn't seem to be greatly affected.
   He said he spent Tuesday playing, ``but when the riot started I
went in the house.''
   Marcine, 10, lives on NW Third Avenue, near the heart of the
disturbance and some of the strongest efforts to quell it.
   ``They threw tear gas,'' he said. ``We put on the fan and put
plastic up in our bedroom windows.''
   After that, he and his family watched the action on television.
   When asked if he understood the unrest, he said ``Nope.''
   Marcine said he'd missed being at Dunbar on Tuesday.
   The principal asked him how he knew the neighborhood was involved
in a riot. ``They said it was a riot,'' he said, noting the police
``had on helmets and bullet-proof vests.''
   Coming back to the beautifully manicured school behind the barbed
wire was a welcome change for Marcine from life in the neighborhood.
   ``I was ready to get away from all that,'' he said.

   Bursts of fireworks, thousands of flickering
white lights and strains of American music heralded the start of
five days of inaugural festivities marking George Bush's succession
to the presidency.
   Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle joined their wives,
children and grandchildren Wednesday on the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial for the opening event in a jam-packed series of inaugural
galas, balls and tributes.
   ``Let this inauguration be a time to celebrate who we are and let
it also be a time to remember who we can be,'' the president-elect
told the thousands who gathered around the memorial. ``Let us
rekindle the flame of confidence and commitment so that together we
can accomplish the great goals we have yet to achieve.''
   As twilight neared on an almost balmy January day, the pageant of
colors began. Four members of the Army Golden Knights, trailed by
yellow and black parachutes, softly landed in a designated area near
the memorial. Bush later lit a torch and then called on the crowd
for their ``thousand points of light.''
   In a tribute to the president-elect's campaign theme, the
inaugural committee distributed hand-size flashlights to those who
surrounded the memorial and spilled over to the park area known as
the mall. Officials at the event estimated the crowd at 40,000 but
Officer Raymond Meks of the U.S. Park Police said the total was
about 250,000.
   The president-elect sought to define the slogan, telling the
crowd that the ``thousand points of light'' are ``individuals doing
their part to make America a better place to live.''
   ``Ladies and gentleman, it is the ambition of my presidency to
make these thousand points of light shine brighter than ever before
and where today there is darkness let us work together to bring
light to shine on all of God's children,'' Bush said.
   As the president-elect, his wife, Barbara, who was garbed in a
bright red coat and a Stars and Stripes scarf, and the Quayles
walked up the memorial steps, flashes of red, white, blue, purple
and orange filled the skies from a dazzling fireworks show across
the mall.
   The celebration provided a military show with a flyover of 21
Navy jet fighters, a range of country and pop music from the Gatlin
Brothers, the Beach Boys, Sandy Patti, Lee Greenwood and Up with
People and a bit of family charm.
   As the Beach Boys belted out their 1960s hits ``Help Me Rhonda,''
and ``Barbara Ann,'' a few of the Bush grandchildren, who had
watched the show on their parents' laps, stood up and danced.
   Among the thousands who had come to the event were members of
police departments from Boston and Springfield, Mass., and New York
City, who had endorsed Bush's candidacy during the campaign.
   ``This is something that happens once in your life,'' said
Officer Anthony Lagoda of Brooklyn, N.Y. ``I'm more proud than
nervous.'' Members of New York's finest were invited to march in
Friday's parade.
   And the flashlights for the ``thousand points of light'' received
high marks from those in attendance.
   Janet Alexander, an artist from Spain who worked for the
campaigns of President John Kennedy and former Democratic candidate
Walter Mondale, said the flashlights were ``very effective,
meaningful.''
   Robert and Rodney Corn of Roswell, N.M., received an invitation
to the festivities from the Republican National Committee after
their county of Chavez voted 82 percent GOP.
   The flashlights indicated that Bush will carry his theme through
the presidency, according to Robert Corn.
   ``He means what he says,'' Corn said.

   Sporadic gunfire, arson and rock throwing broke out
again in two black neighborhoods and spread to a third Wednesday,
but police said the city's riot-torn area appeared calmer than
during the two previous nights.
   ``Things are very calm; it's contained,'' Police Chief Perry
Anderson said on ABC-TV's ``Nightline.''
   City commissioners, meeting in emergency session, appointed a
panel with subpoena power to investigate the fatal police shooting
of a black motorcyclist that sparked the disturbances. And the
sister of the motorcyclist's passenger, who died when the vehicle
crashed, made a televised appeal for an end to the violence.
   Deputy Police Chief Walter Martinez said 50 arrests had been made
by 1 a.m. Thursday, on what he called ``the quietest night so far''
since violence erupted Monday. That brought the total of arrests
over three days to about 400.
   The rioting that followed the killing of the 23-year-old, unarmed
motorcylist by a Hispanic policeman has left one person dead, eight
shot, about 20 buildings burned and numerous others looted in the
black neighborhoods of Overtown and Liberty City.
   The violence came as the city prepared to play host to Sunday's
Super Bowl football game, which has attracted tourists and media
from around the country by the thousands.
   On Wednesday, the city was quiet until late afternoon, when shots
were fired at police in the Overtown section and rock throwing was
reported in Liberty City, said Miami police spokesman David Rivero.
Authorities again cordoned off Overtown.
   ``We had a few shots fired at us, but fortunately no one was
hurt,'' Rivero said. Scores of Miami police squad cars and a state
SWAT team went to the spot in a show of force aimed at heading off
more violence.
   In Liberty City, police said fire caused minor damage to a
Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise after a large crowd gathered
outside throwing rocks and bottles.
   Police spokeswoman Stephanie Gibbs said shots were also fired and
rocks and bottles thrown in black sections of Coconut Grove, a
neighborhood south of downtown that previously had not been
seriously affected by the rioting.
   But by 9:30 p.m. it was so quiet in Coconut Grove that police
called off a planned sweep of the neighborhood and decided not to
arrest a large group of people standing on a streetcorner, said
Coral Gables police Sgt. Wayne Harris. Coral Gables is a city
adjacent to Miami.
   Martinez said 250 policemen were deployed, including field
forces, small groups of officers equipped with riot gear that move
in quickly to quell specific disturbances.
   ``We hope we can normalize and go back to routine patrolling,''
Martinez said. ``We don't like being out here 12 hours and being
shot at.''
   Claudia Lubrin, whose brother, Allen Blanchard, died in a
hospital Tuesday, went on television to ``plead to the Overtown
people that they stop the riots.
   ``Put down your weapons _ I do not want my brother to be
remembered with the riots,'' she said.
   Commissioners unanimously approved the special panel amid
warnings from black leaders that there will be more disturbances if
authorities do not act quickly to ease tensions.
   Black leaders warned Mayor Xavier Suarez before the commission
meeting that their community would no longer accept empty promises
and business as usual.
   ``The word is out that there will be more disturbance,'' said The
Rev. William Washington. ``Now we've got to act and act quick.''
   The panel set up by the commission will investigate the death of
Clement Lloyd, shot in the head Monday night as he and a friend sped
through Overtown.
   After discussions, the commissioners approved a suggestion by
Miller Dawkins, the lone black on the five-member commission, who
wanted a board consisting of five policemen and five Overtown
residents, with the mayor as chairman. The panel will have the power
to subpoena witnesses.
   Dawkins acknowledged the board will not satisfy the young people
throwing rocks and bottles, and he appealed to them for time.
   ``I'd like to tell them to give us a chance to work this out, and
to work on all our other ills, such as poor housing, poor education,
joblessness,'' he said. ``And they have to work with us instead of
creating other problems like they are doing now.''
   Some 700 police officers in riot gear arrested an estimated 325
people Tuesday night, most for looting. Most of those arrested for
alleged looting were released on $250 bail. Charges ranged from
trespassing to armed robbery, and many suspects were unable to make
bond, according to jail officials.
   No looting loss estimates were available.
   The FBI, the State Attorney's Office and the police internal
review board are also investigating the police shooting. William
Lozano, 29, the Colombian-born police officer who shot the
motorcyclist, was relieved of duty with pay pending the
investigation.
   City workers entered the riot-torn neighborhoods Wednesday to
begin cleaning the streets. Most schools that closed Tuesday
reopened, although administrators said they expected to send
teachers and students home early.
   The violence began Monday night in Overtown as crowds throwing
rocks and bottles, firing rifles and setting fires. On Tuesday
violence broke out when a white man in a luxury car fired into a
crowd of blacks in Overtown, wounding one man.
   By nightfall burning and looting had spread to adjacent Liberty
City, site of a 1980 race riot also linked to the death of a black
motorcylist at the hands of white police officers. The 1980 uprising
left 18 people dead.
   ``The automatic gunfire _ I don't think we had that in the early
'80s,'' said Lt. Rick Colpitts. ``With the high-caliber rifles that
are accurate and deadly ... it's the most dangerous situation I've
been in in 22 years as a policeman.''
   On Tuesday night, a teen-ager was shot to death in an argument
over a looted office check-riting machine, police said.
   Others shot included two suspected snipers hit in the legs by
police, a 7-year-old girl hit by a sniper and a policeman whose
bulletproof vest stopped a shotgun pellet, police said.
   At a special bond hearing Wednesday that required opening of a
second courtrooom, most people alleged to be looters were ordered
released on $250 bail.
   The Miami Heat basketball game at the Miami Arena at the edge of
Overtown was postponed Tuesday night. The mayor assured Super Bowl
fans that the rioting would have no effect on the game, which is 15
miles north of Overtown.
   ``We don't think there's any problem in making sure the people
have absolute safety in going to the game if that's what they're
coming to Miami for,'' Suarez said.
   In New York City, a spokesman for the Rev. Al Sharpton, who
figured prominently in the Tawana Brawley case, said Sharpton would
speak at a weekend rally in Miami and attend Blanchard's funeral.
   Miss Brawley, a black New York teen-ager, claimed she was
abducted and sexually abused by several white men, but authorities
said they could not substantiate her story. Sharpton maintained the
investigation was conducted in a racist manner.

   As thousands of Republicans jam the city to
celebrate George Bush's presidential inauguration with balls and
banquets, protesters are staging events on the streets to mark their
anger at GOP policies.
   The Counter-Inaugural Coalition for a People's Agenda _ a
gathering of 80 groups ranging from the Gray Panthers to the
Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador _ launched
its activities Wednesday evening with a soup kitchen, dubbed a
``banquet,'' on the plaza in front of Union Station.
   The intended audience was the 2,500 Republican faithful who were
climbing out of limousines and taxis at the Union Station entrance
for a lavish, $1,500 per ticket feast of Maryland crab and roast
veal.
   About an hour before the official Union Station dinner was to
begin, several hundred of those who had enjoyed their free meal of
hot chili and rice, tortilla chips, salad and apple cider started
shouting at the gala guests some 100 yards _ and two police lines _
away.
   ``The extravagance of George Bush's inauguration _ by far the
most expensive in U.S. history _ demonstrates how far removed the
Bush-Quayle administration is from the concerns and worries of most
American people,'' said Lisa Fithian, a spokeswoman for the
protesters.
   The protesters' signs reflected their varied interests. One
banner read, ``House the Homeless, Aid the Poor, U.S. Out of El
Salvador.''
   ``What about the homeless?'' they screamed in unison.
``Fifty-thousand dead from AIDS. Where was George?''
   Park Police officers allowed them to encroach closer to the train
depot than their permit called for. But the officers got
reinforcements _ as well as barricades _ after the shouting started.
   But the coalition's 80 groups had agreed in advance not to
conduct any civil disobedience because, ``We could only do so much
if we wanted to do it well,'' Fithian said. ``We want to ensure that
we maintain a positive attitude.'' They kept their word Wednesday
night.
   The screams were barely audible from the Union Station entrance,
and the black-tie guests inside expressed little concern about the
protests.
   ``I feel it's ridiculous,'' said Seattle business executive
Thomas J. Stewart. ``They hold these staged events every time
Republicans get together and it's in very poor taste.''
   Among the events planned by various protest groups are a ``No
Honeymoon'' concert tonight benefiting the Christic Institute, which
has sued the U.S. government over its Central America policies and
activities. Scheduled to appear are David Crosby, Graham Nash and
Michelle Shocked.
   In addition, the National Organization for Women plans a silent
protest Friday during the inaugural parade down Pennsylvania Avenue,
taking off on Bush's constant references to ``a thousand points of
light.''
   The demonstrators will wear buttons number 1 to 1,000 that light
up and carry the message ``Keep Abortion Legal.''
   The northwest corner of Lafayette Square, across the street from
the White House, has been set aside for demonstrations, but there is
no hour-by-hour schedule of who will be able to use the space.
   Advocates for the homeless and a variety of other problems
already have called on Bush to ask those who contributed money for
the inaugural celebrations to donate an equal amount to solve those
problems.

   A World War II plane hidden under black plastic
sheeting near the Smithsonian Air &amp; Space Museum was intended as a
surprise for George Bush as he views his inaugural parade on Friday.
   Parade organizers said they were disappointed Wednesday that word
got out about the plane through news stories. The newly painted
aircraft is a Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber identical to the one
Bush bailed out of at age 20 after a sortie against the Japanese.
   Organizers had other problems with the aircraft and had to trim
back trees and move a couple of reviewing stands to make way for its
54-foot wingspan.
   The Avenger's wings could be folded back as they would be aboard
an aircraft carrier, but officials said they wanted to ensure that
it would be in full flight position when it passed in front of the
new president. The float will also carry about a dozen members of
Bush's former torpedo squadron, Air Group VT 51.
   The plane's wingspan is so wide, Bush could almost reach out and
touch it from his reviewing stand, said a Navy officer watching over
the plane.
   Bush was rescued from the Pacific Ocean on Sept. 2, 1944, after
he bailed out of his flaming aircraft over the Bonin Islands, 600
miles south of Japan. He won the Distinguished Flying Cross for
heroism during the bombing raid in which his two crew members were
killed.
   The plane in the parade, built in the 1940s by General Motors on
a Grumman design, was flown to Washington by its owner, Cole Stuart
of Valdosta, Ga., after it was spotted by a World War II veteran
working with the USS Yorktown Association in Mount Pleasant, S.C.
   Veterans from the Yorktown arranged for the plane to be in the
parade and also tracked down members of Bush's torpedo squadron,
said Joseph Sharkey, assistant director of the Yorktown veterans
group.
   About 10,000 Avengers were built, according to Grumman historian
Lois Louisolo, with 45 of the old aircraft still registered to fly.

   Authorities towing away the car of a man
being sought in a sexual assault case found him in the trunk with a
beer in his hand and a big grin on his face.
   ``I just stepped back and watched him get out, and I said, `You
son of a gun,''' said Detective James Boreman.
   A 19-year-old woman reported she was sexually assaulted by a man
who gave her a ride home from work Tuesday night.
   Officers found the man's car, but could not find him, Boreman
said.
   Boreman said he was inspecting the car at the police garage when
he heard a voice say, ``It's about time. I wondered if you guys were
ever going to come down.''
   Boreman said he opened the trunk and watched the man roll out
with ``a big grin on his face.''
   ``He had a Stroh's while he waited,'' Boreman said. ``There were
33 more that (he) could have had.''
   The 28-year-old man was arrested and later released on bond, but
was not formally charged.
   Boreman said the man likely spent about four hours in the trunk.

   In an emotional reunion 44 years later, George
Bush paid tribute to the his World War II Navy flying comrades and
the submarine crewmen who nicknamed him ``Ellie'' after pulling him
from the drink.
   Fireworks lit up the sky over the Lincoln Memorial as Bush, about
to become the nation's 41st president, spent half an hour of quiet
reflection Wednesday night with about three dozen of his war buddies.
   ``He spoke with great feeling about what the squadron and the
Finback's crewmen meant to him,'' said retired Rear Adm. Lawrence
Heyworth of Virginia Beach, Va. ``Mrs. Bush's eyes kind of teared up
a little. It was very intimate.''
   Heyworth was gunnery and torpedo officer aboard the USS Finback
in September 1944 when Bush was one of five young Navy aviators
rescued by the submarine after being shot down by the Japanese over
the Pacific.
   Bush has accorded the Finback veterans, the widows of a few
others and an equal number of members of his aircraft carrier
Torpedo Squadron VT-51 from World War II the choicest seats at
several inaugural events.
   But first he welcomed them to his temporary quarters at the Blair
House across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House for a private
reunion.
   ``It was very emotional,'' said Don Kohler, 64, of Rogers, Ark.,
the submarine torpedoman who helped pull Bush out of his bobbing
orange life raft onto the deck of the Finback after he had bailed
out of his flaming torpedo bomber on Sept. 2, 1944.
   ``You have to remember that few of us had seen any of the others
from the Finback for 44 years,'' Kohler said. ``And meeting under
these circumstances where the president-elect personally welcomes
us, it was pretty moving.''
   Kohler said Bush told the group that ``the youngness that was
there all those years ago and the things we were fighting for had a
great deal to do with directing his life and ideas.''
   Bush spent a few moments with each of the veterans, signing
pictures, looking at their scrapbooks, swapping remembrances.
   Heyworth quoted Bush as saying: ``If it weren't for you people in
this room, I wouldn't be here and I certainly wouldn't have been
elected president of the United States.''
   Hugo Parkman, 69, of Stone Mountain, Ga., the Finback's
communications officer, recalled Bush as ``a very clean-cut young
man.''
   ``I shared my bunk with him,'' Parkman said. ``That is, when I
was on duty, he slept, and when he was on duty I slept. On a
submarine everything's so tight, bunks don't get cold.''
   ``He was a very regular guy,'' said Parkman. ``We never knew that
he came from a distinguished family. He didn't tell anybody anything
about that.''
   W.E. ``Bill'' Edwards of Bay St. Louis, Miss., an insurance agent
and retired Navy commander, recalled that Bush was nicknamed
``Ellie'' by the submarine's crewmen because he would imitate a
braying elephant. But it had nothing to do with his aspiring
politics.
   ``We had a nickname for everyone aboard, and George was a very
smart, fun loving guy,'' Edwards said. ``He was always joking,
mimicking this elephant. I think he'd seen too many Tarzan movies.''
   Then a 20-year-old lieutenant and the Navy's youngest pilot, Bush
was flying a bombing run against a Japanese radio communications
center in the Bonin Islands 600 miles south of Japan when enemy fire
struck his TBM Avenger. He later won a Distinguished Flying Cross
for completing the run before bailing out of the flaming plane.

   At least 15 people attending a funeral
lunch for an eight-year-old girl died of food poisoning in the
southern city of Hyderabad, news reports said today.
   Police Commissioner T. S. Rao said Wednesday's tragedy occurred
when an unidentified chemical substance mistaken for salt was used
to prepare the customary lunch, the Press Trust of India reported.
   The agency said four of the dead were children.
   About 20 people ate the lunch and most of them started vomiting.
Two died before they could be given medical help and 13 died later
at the hospital. The remaining five were in critical condition, the
news agency said.
   Hyderabad, capital of Andhra Pradesh state, is about 775 miles
south of New Delhi.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The police chief said he has ``major concerns'' in
understanding why a police officer shot to death a black
motorcyclist who was being sought for speeding.
   ``There seem to be some unusual occurrences'' in the shooting of
23-year-old Clement Lloyd, which sparked three days of riots, Police
Chief Perry Anderson said Wednesday night on ABC-TV's ``Nightline.''
   A police officer chased Lloyd because he was speeding.
Colombian-born Officer William Lozano, who fired the shot that
struck Lloyd in the head, was taking a report from a crime victim in
an unrelated incident when Lloyd sped by, authorities said.
   ``There might have been a perception of a (more serious) crime
being committed by the officer (Lozano), but we're looking at that
to determine exactly what transpired,'' the chief said.
   Anderson said the law prevented him from discussing aspects of
the investigation into Monday evening's shooting, but added, ``we
have major concerns in dealing with the reason why the officer fired
the shot.''
   Lozano was relieved of duty with pay pending the investigation.
   The shooting is being investigated by the police internal review
board, the FBI, the State Attorney's Office and a special panel
approved by city commissioners in an emergency session Wednesday.
   The Miami-Dade Police Department has a strict, 20-page policy on
the circumstances under which officers may shoot at a fleeing
suspect.
   It says an officer can use deadly force only to ``prevent death
or substantial harm to the officer or another person'' or ``to
prevent the escape of a fleeing felon who would pose a real threat
of death or substantial harm to the community or police officers.''
   The policy says the department ``places a greater value on the
preservation of life than on the protection of property.'' Officers
will use deadly force ``with great restraint and as a last resort.''
   ``Deadly force shall not be used against misdemeanors and traffic
violators,'' it says.
   The policy also says that ``shooting at or from a moving vehicle
is a dangerous and ineffective practice and is generally prohibited.
   ``However, there may be unique situations or mitigating
circumstances in which an officer may be justified in using
firearms,'' it says.

   In his most detailed explanation of planned
reductions in the Soviet Union's armed forces, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev said troops will be cut by 12 percent and the military
budget trimmed by 14.2 percent.
   In a meeting Wednesday with visiting dignitaries, Gorbachev also
rebuffed suggestions that only obsolete tanks would be destroyed.
   The Soviet leader said his plan to cut the armed forces by
500,000 troops in two years, first announced in his speech to the
United Nations last month, would bring a reduction of 240,000
soldiers in the European theater, 200,000 in Asia and 60,000 in the
southern Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev also said the production of arms and military supplies
would be slashed by 19.5 percent and 10,000 tanks would be
eliminated in Europe, of which ``5,000 will be physically
liquidated, and the others transformed into towing vehicles for
civilian needs or into training simulators.''
   He accused some in the West of disparaging the unilateral Soviet
move by claiming that only obsolete armored vehicles would be
destroyed.
   ``Here's the way it is: We will withdraw 5,000 of the most modern
tanks from our military groups,'' Gorbachev said.
   The Soviet leader gave the details in a meeting with former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing of France, former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone and other visiting dignitaries.
   His remarks, distributed by the official Tass news agency, were
the most detailed explanation yet of the planned Soviet cuts, which
he announced Dec. 7 in a United Nations speech.
   ``Of the 500,000 men, by which the army and fleet will be reduced
in two years, 240,000 will come from the European part of the
country, 200,000 in the east, and 60,000 in the south,'' Gorbachev
said.
   Gorbachev also said the second phase of the withdrawal of Soviet
military units from Mongolia, a Moscow ally, will begin soon, and
that they will be cut by 75 percent. A Soviet air force group
stationed in Mongolia will be liquidated, he said.
   He also said many Red Army units of an ``offensive character''
will be withdrawn from Eastern Europe.
   By Jan. 1, 1991, all remaining Soviet units stationed on the
territory of Moscow allies in that region will have taken on ``an
exclusively defensive character,'' he said.
   On Monday, a Soviet general was quoted as telling Austrian
television that his country's unilateral withdrawal from Eastern
Europe will begin in April.
   Deputy Defense Minister Vitaly Shabanov was quoted as saying the
partial withdrawal of 50,000 troops from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany, announced by Gorbachev in his U.N. speech, will take
place in two phases.
   The first phase will be complete this year, and the second in
1990, Austrian television reported Shabonov as saying in an
interview with its Moscow correspondent.
   About 600,000 Soviet troops are currently stationed in the East
Bloc, the bulk of them in East Germany.

<TEXT>
   The drought of 1988 was the nation's worst
natural disaster on record, causing an estimated $30 billion in
agricultural losses, and its releated heat wave contributed to
10,000 deaths, researchers reported.
   ``If these data are correct, it's the Number One natural disaster
in this country,'' said John A. Dracup, a civil engineer at the
University of California, Los Angeles, who is developing ways to
assess drought severity.
   The second worst was the hurricane that struck Galveston, Texas,
on Sept. 8, 1900, killing 6,000 people, Dracup said.
   Norman Rosenberg of Resources for the Future in Washington, D.C.,
said more bad news is on the way.
   ``The drought of 1988 is not over,'' he said. ``A large portion
of the country still remains vulnerable. If we have a dry spring, we
could have a very serious situation.''
   Rosenberg and Dracup were among a panel of experts who gathered
at the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science to assess the effects of the drought.
   Stanley A. Changnon of the Illinois State Water Survey, who has
tried to tally the damages, said the drought was slightly less
severe in area and intensity than the droughts of 1932-1936 and
1953-1956.
   Nevertheless, 70 percent of the nation experienced ``extensively
warm and dry conditions,'' he said. Wheat, corn and soybean
production fell by 30 percent to 40 percent.
   Agricultural losses throughout the United States totaled $30
billion even though all the damage has not yet been tallied,
including the drought's effect on feed development, the livestock
industry and the consumer, who faces an increase of 2 percent to 4
percent in food prices, Changnon said.
   Summer high temperatures set records for any date in 13 percent
of the country, contributing to an estimated 10,000 deaths related
to heat stress, Changnon said.
   The most long-lasting effects will be losses to the environment,
Changnon said. The populations of certain species of wildlife in the
Mississippi River basin were reduced by 5 percent to 30 percent. The
damage due to forest fires was the greatest on record.
   Changnon and the other researchers did not give details of how
they derived their figures on the drought's severity.
   Falling water levels in the Mississippi River stopped barge
traffic in June and July, greatly disrupting shipments of coal,
grains and petroleum products.
   The researchers agreed it was impossible to say whether the
drought was evidence that the global warming known as the greenhouse
effect was beginning to take hold.
   Stephen H. Schneider of the National Center for Atmospheric
Research in Boulder, Colorado, said that the greenhouse effect could
be expected to increase the severity of droughts but not their
frequency.
   Whether the drought of 1988 was intensified by an underlying
greenhouse effect or was just caused by unusual seasonal weather
variations cannot be determined, he said.
   Schneider said most climatologists believe the immediate cause of
the drought was colder-than-usual temperatures in the tropical
Pacific Ocean, which are known to affect weather in the United
States.
   David R. Rodenhuis, director of the Climate Analysis Center at
the National Weather Service, said 26 percent of the continental
United States received less than half its normal rainfall during
April, May and June, 1988.
   In late July, 40 percent of the United States was covered by
severe or extreme drought conditions, Rodenhuis said.
   ``We still do have a continuing dryness in the northern plains
and the northwest part of the country,'' he said.

<HEAD>Researchers Say Accelerator Could Also Help Neutralize Radioactive
Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear researcher says there is reason to
believe that a linear accelerator could be used to help neutralize
highly radioactive waste in addition to producing tritium, a key
ingredient in atomic warheads.
   Rod Powell, manager of engineering development at the
Westinghouse-Hanford Co. in Washington state, said Wednesday that
high-level radioactive waste could be bombarded with neutrons in an
accelerator and changed into low-level radioactive waste.
   ``It would be a new twist,'' Powell said in a telephone
interview. He cautioned that the technology still needs to be proven
in a pilot project, but added that the Japanese are already studying
the possibility of using an accelerator for such a purpose.
   The federal government is currently grappling with the problem of
disposing of massive amounts of highly radioactive waste, both from
commercial nuclear reactors and from the production of nuclear
weapons.
   Existing plans call for storing the waste in an underground
repository in Nevada, but the project has already been fraught with
problems and delays.
   Scientists at Westinghouse-Hanford and at the Los Alamos and
Brookhaven national laboratories have been studying the idea of
using an accelerator to produce tritium, a radioactive gas used in
nuclear warheads, for more than a year.
   The work comes amid increasing concern about the reliability and
safety at the Energy Department's three tritium producing reactors
at the Savannah River complex in South Carolina.
   Powell said that researchers were convinced that an accelerator
could be used to produce enough tritium to meet demand and also be
used for other purposes.
   The accelerator could also be used to produce special isotopes
for everything from sophisticated medical equipment to a new device
that the Federal Aviation Administration is developing to detect
plastic explosives, he said.
   An accelerator is essentially a long tunnel in which subatomic
particles are whipped at high speeds until they crash into a target,
in this case lithium clad in aluminum. The resulting collision
produces tritium.
   In using an accelerator to deal with radioactive waste, Powell
said the process is essentially similar.
   As an example, Powell said the most deadly elements could be
separated from spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor and than
bombarded with neutrons in an accelerator.
   ``The actual word is transmutate,'' said Powell. ``It could be a
way of disposing of (radioactive) waste.''
   The Energy Department provided $300,000 to initially fund
research into using an accelerator for tritium production, but no
funding was provided in the current fiscal year, Powell said.
   According to a copy of a summary report prepared by the
scientists and obtained by The Associated Press last week, an
accelerator could produce tritium more cheaply, quickly and safely
than a nuclear reactor.
   Last July, the Energy Department recommended construction of two
new tritium producing reactors, one at the Savannah River complex in
South Carolina and the other at the Idaho Falls National Laboratory
in Idaho.
   Powell said the researchers were disappointed when the department
didn't decide to pursue the accelerator alternative, but decided to
continue the work.

<HEAD>Opposition Attacks Kohl In Parliament Over Libyan Plant Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition verbally assaulted
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Parliament, alleging his government tried
to cover up West Germany companies' involvement in a suspected
Libyan chemical weapons plant.
   ``The question is, what you knew and what you did about it,''
opposition lawmaker Norbert Gansel said as Kohl sat grimly next to
the speaker's podium.
   ``You, Herr Chancellor, are politically and personally
responsible that the German and international public were deceived
for a long time,'' Gansel, a Social Democrat and an expert on
weapons, charged during Wednesday's debate.
   The United States alleges the Libyan plant, in the desert about
40 miles from Tripoli, is on the verge of full-scale production of
chemical weapons. Libya denies the charge, saying the plant will
produce pharmaceuticals.
   Wolfgang Schaeuble, Kohl's chief of staff, opened Wednesday's
two-hour debate by saying the U.S. Embassy in Bonn first informed
West German officials in May about possible West German involvement
in the plant.
   But the May notification date is five months earlier than what
the government acknowledged Monday and six months earlier than what
West German leaders mentioned three weeks ago after Washington
forced the issue public.
   Initially, the Bonn government angrily denied the U.S.
allegations that West German companies were involved in the plant.
It also denied knowing the complex could produce poison gas.
   Officials have since said the government did not immediately say
what it knew because that would have jeopardized West German
investigations.
   At least three West German companies are now under criminal
investigation for dealings with Libya. Two are suspected of
involvement in the construction and outfitting of the plant in
Rabta, one of helping refit Libyan warplanes so they can refuel in
mid-flight.
   Opposition lawmakers shouted and hooted during Schaeuble's
speech, interrupting him several times.
   Schaeuble rejected any suggestion West German authorities had
tried to cover up the affair.
   He said that in August 1987, West German intelligence services
received information the plant ``in all probability'' was intended
for producing chemical weapons. He said there was no evidence at the
time of West German involvement in the plant.
   Kohl received his first ``comprehensive'' report on the
suspicions Oct. 20, Schaeuble said.
   He also said that ``on the basis of intelligence reports, we must
assume that this plant in Rabta is intended to produce chemical
weapons.''
   According to Schaeuble, ``new reports'' by the West German
Intelligence Service ``gave clear indications of involvement by
German companies'' in the Libyan factory.
   Schaeuble said that on Dec. 14 West German investigators met with
an ``informant'' who gave them documents indicating involvement by
the West German firm Imhausen-Chemie in the Libyan plant. According
to Schaeuble, the informant said other documents could be obtained
from I.B.I. Engineering, a now-defunct company that was based in
Frankfurt.
   Criminal investigations have been launched against Imhausen,
based in Lahr, and I.B.I., which allegedly organized participation
by other West German companies in the Libyan plant.
   Although Kohl was present during the debate, he did not speak. A
government spokesman said Schaeuble delivered the speech because it
was a matter of protocol.
   Schaeuble, in an interview later Wednesday with West German
television, said the government ``had now disclosed everything it
knows to Parliament ... There is no need now from my viewpoint for
further disclosure.''
   Prosecutors also said Wednesday that they are investigating a
report the Intec Technical Trade and Logistik company that is based
outside Munich has been helping Libya develop the ability to refuel
its warplanes while in flight to extend their range.
   Meanwhile in Belgium, U.S. Gen. William Burns, director of the
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, said, ``The thing now to do is
to allow the German government to deal with this problem as a
domestic issue.''

<HEAD>Energy Use Set Record Last Year; Oil Import Rise Continued</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An energy industry trade group says U.S. oil
imports hit a nine-year high in 1988 as Americans used more energy
than in any year in history.
   The American Petroleum Institute, representing the bigger oil
producers and refiners, said U.S. consumption of all types of energy
rose 4 percent last year, surpassing the previous record set in
1979, the year the last oil crisis struck.
   Oil imports last year jumped nearly 9 percent, to a rate of 7.2
million barrels a day, which was the highest level since 1979.
   The group said its index of energy efficiency _ the amount of
energy used to produce each unit of economic output _ ``suggests'' a
small improvement for 1988 over the previous year, if the figures
are adjusted for seasonal factors such as weather.

   The Energy Department has formally crowned
Texas the winner of a seven-state battle to host a proposed $5.9
billion superconducting super collider.
   At a formal ceremony attended by Texas Gov. Bill Clements, John
Herrington, the energy secretary, signed an official ``record of

around the city of Waxahachie, about 25 miles south of Dallas.
   The collider is envisioned as a 53-mile underground ring that
would use 10,000 magnets to whirl beams of protons into each other
at energy levels 20 times what is possible in today's most powerful
machines.
   Scientists will use the facility, to be called the Ronald Reagan

   A federal government scientist says the best,
cheapest way to explore Mars would be to land astronauts on the
planet's moons rather than on the surface of the planet.
   Fred Singer, an astronomer and the Department of Transportation's
chief scientist, said that putting researchers on either Phobos or
Deimos, would enable engineers to direct mobile robot craft to
explore and collect samples from the Martian surface.
   ``Sending an expedition to the moons of Mars has the advantage of
being the best we could do, the least expensive and the soonest,''
Singer said Wednesday in a luncheon address at the Touchdown Club.
``My hope that the time is right now for us to go in this

<HEAD>Diplomats Hope For Progress On Returning Injured, Sick Gulf War POWs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bitterness that lingers after eight
years of war is still so intense that diplomats say they doubt there
will be progress in Iran-Iraq peace talks when a U.N. mediator
visits the region next week.
   But they say they hope at least for the resumption of prisoner
exchanges.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is sending Swedish
U.N. Ambassador Jan. K. Eliasson to Baghdad and Tehran in an effort
to persuade Iraq and Iran to show some flexibility.
   Both sides accepted a cease-fire on Aug. 20, but peace talks that
opened five days later deadlocked almost immediately.
   A 1987 Security Council resolution calls on both countries to
halt all military activities, withdraw their troops to the border,
exchange about 100,000 war prisoners and talk peace.
   Iraq still occupies about 260 square miles of Iranian territory
and says it will not withdraw until Iran gives up the right to
search ships for war cargo bound for Iraq. It considers that a
military activity.
   Iran, which has not stopped any Iraqi-bound ships since the
cease-fire began, says the withdrawal to the border must be the next
step in the peace process.
   U.N. officials and diplomats, speaking Wednesday on condition of
anonymity, did not foresee progress on those issues but said
progress was possible on the exchange of sick or injured POWs and
other technical measures.
   Both sides have also given the United Nations ``expressions of
interest'' in resuming the exchange of POWS, the U.N. official said.
   Last year, the International Committee of the Red Cross worked
out a plan to register all POWs and send home sick or injured POWs
but the arrangement broke down after just a few dozen had been
exchanged.
   One of the U.N. officials also said Iran and Iraq appear ready to
begin direct contacts between military officers to discuss their
frequent complaints about cease-fire violations.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said he
hoped for progress on substantial issues, including the impasse over
the Shatt-al-Arab waterway forming the border between Iran and Iraq,
but noted ``these are matters of deeper pride.''
   The waterway is Iraq's only deep-water access to the Persian Gulf.

   A strong earthquake shook a 70 mile area late
Wednesday, causing downtown buildings to sway and rock slides in
Malibu, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major
damage.
   ``It's the strongest earthquake I've felt in 14 years of living
in Los Angeles. It actually scared me. Our house went dark. My
daughter woke up and began crying,'' said Rick Cziment of the Venice
area, 10 miles southwest of downtown.
   The quake, which struck at 10:55 p.m., was centered about eight
miles south of Malibu in the Pacific Ocean and registered 5.0 on the
Richter Scale, according to the California Institute of Technology
in Pasadena.
   It was felt as far away as Santa Barbara, 70 miles northwest of
Los Angeles.
   Some power and telephone services were cut, but the Los Angeles
County sheriff's department said there were no immediate reports of
injuries or damage.
   Residents of coastal areas reported pictures being knocked off
walls. Windows were shattered and rock slides were reported in the
Malibu area.
   ``It was very strong,'' said Jack Gardner, who lives in Santa
Monica, about 15 miles west of downtown. ``It shook some stuff off
the shelves and it set off a lot of car alarms in the neighborhood.
We could see our house flex. It's the first time that I've been
really scared by an earthquake.''
   The 35-story Bonaventure Hotel downtown swayed, but most guests
seemed to react calmly, said Assistant Manager Doug Dreher.
   ``Some of our foreign guests haven't really felt an earthquake
before, and they wanted to know what was going on,'' he said. ``Some
of them are a little bit in shock.''
   The Whittier Narrows earthquake, Southern California's most
severe quake in years, struck on Oct. 1, 1987, killing eight people,
injuring 200 and causing $358 million in damage. It registered 5.9
on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

<HEAD>Republicans Feast While Protesters Highlight Poverty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush was toasted with champagne,
serenaded by the Whiffenpoof songsters from Yale and cheered at a
$1,500-a-plate inaugural dinner by Republican fat cats who refused
to let chanting protesters and homeless onlookers spoil their party.
   Outside Union Station on Wednesday night, street people stood
eating a soup-kitchen supper of chili and rice off paper plates
while protesters shouted chants of ``Food for the Poor, Not the
Rich'' and ``What About the Homeless?'' at stretch limousines
delivering black-tie guests to the dinner inside.
   Once the police erected barricades and shooed away several
hundred demonstrators, about 2,500 Republican Party stalwarts and
wealthy contributors settled down at three great halls around town
to feast on Maryland crab and mushroom-stuffed loins of veal washed
down with California wines from crystal goblets.
   Just as the diners were polishing off the apple-cranberry brown
betty with cinnamon ice cream and bourbon custard, President-elect
Bush and Dan Quayle, his vice president-to-be, arrived in the
vaulted main hall of Union Station from visits to other dinners at
the Pension Building and the Corcoran Gallery of Art.
   They were running 25 minutes late _ ``We're exhausted,'' Bush
said _ but the GOP's big spenders finally got what they paid for,
and they went slightly wild. Heraldic trumpets blared from a
balcony. Cameras flashed. Women in sequined gowns and glittering
necklaces left tables decked with floral trees of white roses and
pushed forward. Bush waved and smiled.
   ``I'm gonna try my level best to be a good president of the
United States, and work for all the people of the United States,''
he said.
   ``You've given me a chance, and I'm not going to let you down.''
   Bush and Penne Percy Korth, co-chairman of the inaugural
committee, toasted each other with champagne. Bush waved his arm and
mouthed the words of his school song, sung by the Whiffenpoof glee
club of his alma mater, Yale University.
   Then he plunged into the crowd of well-wishers, shaking hands,
waving and exchanging hugs for the next 10 minutes. Bush thanked
them for the financial support that helped him win the presidency,
and for underwriting the four days of inaugural festivities with
$100,000 interest-free loans.
   Earlier, on the plaza facing the newly refurbished train station,
demonstrators served a ``counter-inaugural banquet'' to several
dozen homeless people from large metal pots steaming in the glare of
television lights, and entertained them with folk singers and
pro-abortion street theater.
   Michael Hasty of the Washington Peace Center said it was ``sick,
decadent'' for the Republicans to eat $1,500 dinners while people
are homeless and starving on the streets.
   ``We've fed over 1,000 people so far tonight with less than a
$200 budget,'' he said. ``I wonder how long it would take for
somebody out on the street to beg for $1,500 in spare change.''
   A half-hour before the dinner inside began at 8 p.m., the crowd
pushed closer to the arriving limousines, and police erected
barricades to prevent a spontaneous surge toward the station's main
entrance. The protesters dispersed peacefully just as their
three-hour permit expired.
   U.S. Park Police also banished from the plaza a half-dozen
conservative Republican activists carrying American flags who said
they wanted to demonstrate against the anti-poverty demonstrators.
Sgt. Robert Kass said the conservatives lacked a permit.
   Grace Stepp, 36, a homeless person, paused between spoonfuls of
chili to say the inaugural diners ``should help us out, too _ they
should get us more shelters and stuff.''
   Roosevelt Carrington, 30, a homeless, unemployed carpenter, said
he thought the black-tie guests should come out and ``eat the same
thing we're having, so they'll know what it's like.''
   But inside, many of the party faithful waiting to pass through
metal detectors at the entrance said they had hardly noticed the
demonstrators and their shouted messages.
   Thomas J. Stewart, a Seattle business executive, termed
``ridiculous'' the protesters' suggestion that the $2.25 million in
proceeds from the inaugural dinners would be better spent helping
the poor and homeless.
   ``They hold these staged events every time Republicans get
together, and it's in very poor taste,'' Stewart said.
   ``The people here tonight have probably contributed more, as
individuals and corporations, to the welfare of this country than
anybody else,'' said Jim Hewgley, a Tulsa, Okla., oilman. ``If they
want to celebrate, then, by God, they're entitled to.''
   Stew Jackson, president of a burglar alarm company in Denver,
predicted that Bush would ``do a lot for the homeless,'' which he
endorses. ``But I also support those who do something to help
themselves,'' Jackson said.
   David Eller of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., a water pump manufacturer
and weekly newspaper publisher who qualifies as a Republican
``Eagle'' for donating a minimum of $10,000 to party campaigns, said
there were plenty of jobs available for the homeless. ``If they'd
rather protest than do an honest day's work, I don't have too much
sympathy for them,'' he said.

   Elvis Presley is no longer king and sole
ruler at radio station WHOS but he's ``still a good guy,'' says
station manager Mack Bramlett.
   Because of poor ratings, the AM station has abandoned the
all-Elvis format it adopted in October, Bramlett said. It is now
simultaneously broadcasting the country music format of its sister
station, WDRM-FM.
   When WHOS switched from a gospel format toElvis, billboards in
Decatur proclaimed that Elvis was indeed alive.
   ``We gave it the promotion it needed,'' Bramlett said. But he
said the effort failed because more than 75 percent of radio
listeners tune in to FM stations, which provide better sound quality.
   ``People just don't use AM anymore,'' he said.
   Two other AM stations, WAAY and WAJF, recently succumbed to a
decreasing audience and went off the air, but Bramlett said he
expects WHOS to survive.
   ``If it were not for the FM station we would be taking it hard,''
he said.
   Bramlett said he is searching for ideas for a new format.
   ``We have to find something that will serve the public and
survive at the same time,'' he said.

   Theo Cooper says her 5-month-old pig
has learned to sit, stay and walk on a leash, just like his
classmates in dog obedience school.
   Wilbur, a 45-pound miniature hog, is one of an increasing number
of pigs bred as pets. Affectionate, intelligent and playful, the hog
delights in knocking over trash cans and untying visitors'
shoelaces, Mrs. Cooper said Wednesday.
   Wilbur has had trouble keeping up with the dogs in the obedience
class, however, possibly because of a slightly lame leg, his owner
said.
   ``He has trouble learning to lie down because he's concerned
whether he's going to get his food if he can't see it,'' she said.
   Despite the species' soiled reputation, Wilbur is odorless and
litter box-trained, Mrs. Cooper said. He does eat like a pig,
though, devouring apples, milk and commercial pig chow, she said.
   Wilbur has become a familiar sight in this western Massachusetts
town and accompanies Mrs. Cooper on her visits to nursing homes to
cheer residents up.
   ``They love him,'' she said. ``A lot of older people lived on

   ``The dance will promote a pooling of spiritual energy in an
appeal to the ancient snow god for a grand northeaster,'' the type
of winter storm that typically blankets New England with snow, said
Ken White, the ski area's marketing director.
   Asked whether the snow dance was a recognized part of religious

<HEAD>Mass Killers: `Grandstand Suicides' Bent On Revenge Against World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN MACLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychologists say mass murderers like the
drifter who sprayed rifle fire at his boyhood school are part of a
recent unprecedented wave of ``grandstand suicides'' expressing a
hair-trigger anger at the world.
   But some experts warn that such acts of violence, whether they
represent a copycat trend or are only isolated incidents, should not
turn the nation's schools into ``armed camps.''
   The issue took on new significance as police investigated the
motivations of Patrick Purdy, a drifter who returned to his former
elementary school on Tuesday and opened fire on a crowd of children,
killing five students and wounding 30 people before killing himself.
   ``For these people, it is typically their last chance to show
society how angry they are,'' Michael Mantell, chief psychologist
for the San Diego Police Department,'' said Wednesday. ``Striking
out at children is their way of building up their flagging egos by
taking out their frustration on young victims.''
   ``It's the fad of the last year. We've had more this last year
than ever before,'' said James Alan Fox, co-author of ``Mass Murder:
America's Growing Menace'' and a psychologist and criminology
professor at Northeastern University in Boston.
   During 1988, there were five shooting rampages at public schools
in the United States.
   Fox noted that 19-year-old Jamie Wilson, charged with two counts
of murder in an attack on a Greenwood, S.C. elementary school last
year, was reported to be a ``fan'' of Laurie Dann, the woman who
shot and killed herself after gunning down children at a Winnetka,
Ill., elementary school earlier in 1988.
   But despite the increasing number of school shootings, they can't
all be blamed on copycats, although mass murder locations tend to
cluster, Fox said. After the massacre of 21 people at a McDonald's
restaurant in San Ysidro, near San Diego, in 1984, there was a
similar but less deadly attack on another McDonald's in Detroit.
   ``You do it (mass murder) in a confined place like a restaurant,
a McDonald's, or a school,'' he said, calling such bursts of
violence ``revenge against society'' for a lifetime of frustrations.
   ``And what better way to do it than take it out on children, the
thing that is most dear to us?'' he said.
   Mantell described Purdy's death as a ``grandstand suicide.''
   ``The reason people do that `grandstand suicide' is often to say
to the world, `I am important. Look at me,''' Mantell said.
``Someone who has given up on life has nothing to lose.''
   Police said Purdy wore an olive-drab shirt bearing the Iranian
battle cry ``Death to the Great Satin'' (sic) and the words ``PLO''
and ``Libya.''
   Carved into the stock of the assault rifle was the word
``Hezbollah,'' the name of the radical Shiite Moslem faction
believed holding American hostages in Lebanon. Also carved into the
rifle were the words ``freedom'' and ``victory.''
   ``What the significance of that is I do not know,'' said Stockton
Police Capt. Dennis Perry. ``He obviously had a military hangup of
some kind.''
   Purdy, who killed himself after shooting the children, selected a
school he attended several years as a child. ``It's very likely that
he had some bad experience (there), maybe he was ridiculed as a
child,'' Fox said. ``As random as it seems, it's very specific:
namely getting back at this place.''
   A day after the Stockton murders, 227 of an expected 940
Cleveland Elementary School students returned to class Wednesday,
said schools spokesman John Klose. Individual and group grief
counseling sessions were available to the children, teachers and
parents, he said, adding that it appeared ``to be working very
well.''
   School officials decided to keep the school open after staff
psychologists agreed the ``preponderance of the evidence supported
going back immediately,'' Klose said. But he said an outside
psychologist told them they made a mistake: ``So there are two
schools of thought on this.''
   Either way, ``there is a wound here that will affect them to some
degree for the rest of their lives,'' said Tom Rusk, associate
professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of California,
San Diego. ``I don't care what kind of therapy is available. You
cannot erase this.''
   Sam Sava, executive director of the National Association of
Elementary School Principals in Alexandria, Va., said the
association pleaded last October for schools to implement security
plans.
   Sava said ``things have changed and we can't have our youngsters
walking around like blind mice, and we have to use the best
educational techniques to help children cope with these dangers.''
   Mantell also urged school authorities to develop security plans,
but he cautioned against turning elementary campuses into ``armed
camps.''
   ``There's very little we can do or should do,'' added Fox. ``We
start making our schools into fortresses, we'll make our kids
paranoid.''
   San Francisco School Superintendent Ramon Cortines said after
Tuesday's shooting that he would ask principals to take
``extraordinary precautions'' for safety.
   ``This shows how vulnerable our children and employees are,'' he
said. ``You can't take any chances with their safety.''

   The man with the microphone was preaching Jesus
through a battered speaker near the Liberty City checkpoint. ``His
love is e-e-e-ternal,'' he intoned as police checked motorists in
the garish light of flares and squad car flashers.
   A few miles north, officers in helmets and flak vests closed in
on a house that might have been the source of gunfire, while fellow
officers laughed and lounged a hundred feet away.
   The streets of Miami's Overtown and Liberty City neighborhoods
were a little easier Wednesday night. But they were still far from
normal.
   The looting and gunfire that punctuated the past two nights was
muted. Police were still out in force. They wore body armor and
toted loaded shotguns, but this night they sipped sodas and snacked
on sandwiches and ice cream as their radios occasionally crackled
with reports of car fires, smashed store windows and rock throwing.
   The picnics spread out on squad car hoods spoke to the relative
calm of the evening. So did the numbers that were being compiled
back at police headquarters. Officials reported 50 arrests by 1
a.m., largely for rock-throwing incidents. Overnight Tuesday there
were 325 arrests, mostly for looting.
   ``We hope we can normalize the situation and get back to routine
patrolling,'' said Deputy Police Chief Walter Martinez.
   The biggest problem for Gary Wilcox, a police sergeant who manned
a Liberty City checkpoint, was fending off outsiders who wanted to
tour the riot scene.
   ``We'll ask people where they're from and they'll say `Kendall,'
'' a white suburb southwest of the city. ``When we ask them why
they're here, they'll say, `Just to see what it's like,''' according
to Wilcox.
   The violence sparked by the fatal police shooting of a black
motorcyclist Monday had not entirely abated. Police were fired upon
at least twice. One man was arrested for shooting at a squad car
from an apartment window. Caravans of police vehicles, known as
field force units, rushed through neighborhoods.
   One field force unit screeched to a halt in front of Lee and
Rita's Grocery after officers thought they heard shots. Three men
lounging in front of the store were forced to the ground while
special weapons and tactics teams checked an adjacent apartment
building.
   The men remained on the ground, watched by two officers. The rest
of the unit leaned on their cars, talking and joking while the SWAT
unit made its cautious rounds. When they failed to find evidence of
a sniper, the men on the ground were released.
   ``We're just trying to get the people off the streets without
disrupting their lives and making sure we're selective about who we
arrest,'' said Lt. Nelson Oramas.
   But mostly, the night seemed an aftermath of the previous two
evenings.
   At the edge of Little Haiti, Manuel Gorelick stood outside his
half-empty furniture store with some friends. On the street was a
huge iron grate that looters pulled off the storefront Tuesday night
after chaining it to a stolen car.
   The street was dotted with rocks, the ammunition used by rioters
on previous nights. Across the street, silent clusters of youths
stared at Gorelick and his partner, Gilberto Cusido, who had one
revolver tucked in his waistband and another in his hip pocket.
   ``I've been here for 10 years,'' Gorelick said. ``I've been
broken into for six times. A couple of times there were riots here,
but this is the worst.''
   Gorelick estimated looters carried off $40,000 of furniture. But
he had no plans of closing down.
   ``We're going to stay here still,'' he said, as the knots of
youths across the street continued to stare. ``We're still serving
the community.''

   A speeding train slammed into a crowded bus at an
unmanned railroad crossing, killing 32 people and injuring 49, a
newspaper said today.
   The Beijing Daily said the accident occurred Wednesday in Nanhui
county of Jilin province in northern China. It said all the
casualties were among the 81 passengers on the bus. Of the injured,
26 were in serious condition.
   Train No. 533, heading from Meihekou to Songlingang, hit the bus
as it crossed an unmanned railroad intersection. The bus was knocked
about 100 feet and the train derailed, the report said.
   Train accidents are not uncommon in China. The most recent
occurred in December, when a passenger train hit a crowded bus,
killing at least 45 people in Liaoning province.

<HEAD>Pioneering Cancer Researcher Michael Shimkin Dead At 76</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Michael Shimkin, a Siberian-born
researcher who helped establish the first links between smoking and
lung cancer three decades ago, has died. He was 76.
   Shimkin, a professor emeritus of community and family medicine at
the University of California, San Diego, died of a stroke Monday at
the UCSD Medical Center, spokeswoman Leslie Franz said Wednesday.
   Shimkin was with the National Cancer Institute when his
population studies in the 1950s demonstrated a relationship between
smoking and lung cancer, Franz said.
   ``It was really among the first studies that began showing a
strong link,'' Franz said. ``His epidemiological work, population
studies, showed a higher incidence of lung cancer among smokers.''
   Shimkin, who joined the UCSD faculty in 1969, began researching
the causes of cancer in the 1930s as a fellow at the National Cancer
Institute.
   He remained there until 1963, when he moved to Temple
University's Health Sciences Center in Philadelphia. Shimkin also
served with the United States Public Service from 1939 to 1963.
   ``He believed that the public does not clearly understand what is
harmful and what is not with regard to cancer,'' said Dr. Cedric
Garland, a UCSD cancer epidemiologist.
   ``He tried to emphasize the importance of major factors such as
smoking, drinking and diet over concerns about trace chemicals
linked to cancer.''
   During a career that spanned five decades, Shimkin wrote more
than 300 articles and books. Two of his books, ``Science and
Cancer'' and ``Contrary to Nature,'' are considered classics in the
field of cancer research.
   Shimkin, a native of Tomsk, Siberia, came to the United States as
a small child when his family fled the Soviet Union to escape the
Bolshevik Revolution.
   Survivors include his wife, Mary North Shimkin; two sons, Dr.
Peter Michael Shimkin of Fairfield, Conn., and Philip North Shimkin
of Teaneck, N.J.; a daughter, Ann Mary Segal of Bethesda, Md.
   A Feb. 2 memorial service is scheduled, but the time and place
haven't yet been determined, Franz said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews Jan. 4-12 with 1,162 adults in the
continental United States. The phone numbers were selected randomly
by computer and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the
most recent birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that if every adult
American were asked the same questions, the results theoretically
would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 times out of 20.
The margin of error is larger for subgroups _ 5 points, for example,
for conservatives.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions and
responses in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:

<HEAD>Public Doubts Bush on Tax Pledge but Views him Favorably</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans have read his lips but expect George
Bush to break his pledge of no new taxes, although a solid majority
likes him anyway, a national poll has found.
   Bush made opposition to taxes a cornerstone of his presidential
campaign, and six in 10 respondents to the Media General-Associated
Press poll agreed he should not seek a tax increase. But 71 percent
said they think he will.
   Even still, the survey found high approval ratings for Bush, who
takes office Friday as the 41st president. Respondents voiced high
expectations for his presidency and gave him strong marks for his
cabinet choices.
   A solid 59 percent said they viewed Bush favorably, precisely the
same approval rate President Reagan received in a Media General-AP
poll last spring. Only 25 percent rated Bush unfavorably; the rest
withheld judgment.
   Bush fared well in another comparison with his popular
predecessor: Expectations for his presidency came close to the
ratings of Reagan's performance in a Media General-AP poll conducted
this fall.
   Forty-eight percent in the new poll said Bush would be a good
president and 13 percent said he would be excellent; this fall, 47
percent said Reagan would be recorded in history as a good
president, 20 percent excellent.
   The new poll was conducted by telephone Jan. 4-12 among a random
sample of 1,162 adults nationwide. It has a 3-point margin of
sampling error.
   Although many respondents were unfamiliar with Bush's nominees
for his Cabinet, those who did have opinions were strongly positive.
Overall, 45 percent said their impression was that the Cabinet was a
good one and 8 percent called it excellent.
   The poll found a limited desire for more women or minority
nominees to the Cabinet, with 70 percent saying race and sex were
irrelevant. Bush has picked two women, one black and two Hispanics
for Cabinet-level jobs.
   Former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, nominated as
secretary of labor, was the best known and best liked of Bush's more
prominent nominees. Sixty-six percent viewed her favorably, a better
rating even than Bush's, while only 7 percent disapproved. The rest
had no opinion.
   James A. Baker III, nominated as secretary of state, received a
57-7 favorable-unfavorable rating, the rest having no opinion;
former Rep. Jack Kemp, picked for secretary of housing, scored
52-10; and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who is keeping his
position, 51-7.
   Majorities had no opinion of former Sen. John Tower, named to
defense; Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, retaining his job; and
Louis Sullivan, health and human services nominee. Eighty-three
percent had no opinion of Bush's new chief of staff, former New
Hampshire Gov. John Sununu.
   Such unfamiliarity aside, 46 percent said Bush has done a good
job since the election in preparing to take over the presidency, and
11 percent said excellent; 28 percent gave him only a fair rating, 7
percent poor.
   Bush did better in approval ratings with wealthier and older
Americans and with men. His greatest support came from Republicans
and conservatives, but even in those groups, six in 10 doubted his
tax pledge, saying they think he will seek higher taxes during the
next four years.
   On ideology, six in 10 said they expected Bush's Cabinet to be
about as conservative as Reagan's, a view shared by the
conservatives polled. Forty percent said the Cabinet was about right
ideologically, with the rest split on their preference.

<HEAD>Experimental Treatment Slows AIDS Spread in Body</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers today reported the first ``very
promising'' evidence outside a test tube that an experimental new
treatment will slow the lethal spread of the AIDS virus inside the
body.
   The medicine, CD4, apparently works as a decoy, mimicking the
blood cells that the virus usually infects and kills.
   In a report in today's journal Nature, researchers reported that
the treatment dramatically reduced the level of virus in monkeys
infected with the simian version of the AIDS virus.
   ``This is the first evidence in vivo (in a living animal) that it
has anti-viral effects with chronic administration in a relevant
animal model,'' said Dr. Robert Schooley of Massachusetts General
Hospital.
   ``That still leaves the question of whether or not there will be
parallel positive effects in humans,'' he said. ``But it does
increase the enthusiasm and the likelihood one would push on with
more extensive studies.''
   Recently, Schooley and others began testing CD4 on people
infected with HIV, the human AIDS virus, but the results will not be
known for weeks.
   ``This approach looks very promising for AIDS,'' said Dr. Norman
L. Letvin, senior author of the monkey study.
   The treatment cannot wipe out the virus when hidden inside the
body's cells. However, if it works as researchers hope, it will
absorb loose virus that is roaming the bloodstream looking for new
cells to take over.
   The latest research, conducted at the Harvard-affiliated New
England Regional Primate Research Center, suggests that CD4 will do
just that. It showed that when given to infected rhesus monkeys, the
drug dramatically reduced levels of the virus.
   The monkeys were infected with simian immunodeficiency virus of
macaques, or SIV, a close relative of the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome in humans. Monkeys that catch SIV grow
sick and die of an illness that closely mirrors human AIDS.
   Even if the treatment works as well in people as it does in
monkeys, it will not cure AIDS. But it might make life better for
victims of the virus.
   ``What one would predict on the basis of these monkey studies is
that if the drug is well tolerated in humans, there is every reason
to hope that patients should live significantly longer and feel
significantly better,'' Letvin said.
   Researchers tested CD4 on six monkeys. Two were healthy, and the
drug had no adverse effects on them. The four others had been
infected for more than a year and had varying stages of disease.
   ``The animals showed a very dramatic response when we looked at
our ability to isolate virus from them during and immediately
following treatment,'' Letvin said.
   The infected animals received daily injections of CD4 for 50
days. Virus in their blood and bone marrow largely disappeared
within two weeks of the start of treatment and returned after the
treatment stopped.
   The animals' marrow, which makes blood cells, also regained
strength during the treatment, an effect that Letvin said was
surprising.
   The sickest of the four died of severe anemia after the treatment
stopped. Letvin said that anemia is sometimes caused by the disease,
but the researchers could not rule out the possibility that it was
also triggered by the treatment.
   CD4 is a natural molecule that's found on the surface of some
blood cells. Among these are the chief victims of the AIDS virus _
scavenger cells called macrophages and helper T cells that
coordinate the body's response to infections.
   When the AIDS virus gets into the body, it is attracted to cells
that carry CD4. The virus locks onto the CD4 and worms its way
inside. Then it takes over the cell, eventually turning into a
factory to make more virus.
   The new drug is a soluble form of CD4 made through genetic
engineering. Theoretically, it provides so many targets for the
virus that it is lured harmlessly away from uninfected cells.
   Letvin's monkey research and Schooley's human testing is being
done with a form of CD4 made by Biogen Inc., a biotechnology firm in
Cambridge, Mass. Human testing has also begun with CD4 made by
Genentech in South San Francisco.

<TEXT>
   A gunman who killed five elementary school pupils and wounded 30
in California before killing himself with a Soviet-designed assault
rifle has rekindled the issue of gun control.
   ``We never believed private citizens ought to have weapons of
war,'' said Barbara Lautman, spokeswoman for Handgun Control, the
anti-gun lobby in Washington, D.C.
   ``Why would someone need an assault weapon? The average sportsman
or hunter does not need a weapon capable of firing 100 rounds a
minute. It defies logic,'' she said Wednesday in a telephone
interview.
   But pro-gun forces defended the right of citizens to own guns,
saying that more judicious prosecution of the gunman on previous
arrests would have put him behind bars and averted the bloodbath.
   ``It's a case study of the failure of the criminal justice system
that this man was on the streets,'' said David Conover, a lobbyist
with the National Rifle Association. ``We continue to oppose
restrictive gun control measures.''
   ``Gun control laws in general don't work,'' said Craig Markva of
Gun Owners of America, a lobbying group in Washington, D.C.
``Everybody will be calling for mandatory background checks. (But)
he would have slipped through the cracks even if he had a background
check.''
   Patrick Edward Purdy, wearing a military flak jacket and
earplugs, killed himself after firing up to 110 rounds from a
bayonet-equipped, semi-automatic AK-47 assault rifle at youngsters
on recess Tuesday at Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton. He
also had two handguns.
   Purdy, 26, bought the rifle, which he inscribed with the words
``freedom'' and ``victory,'' for $147 in August in Sandy, Ore. He
had at least four prior arrests in California, none of which
resulted in a felony conviction.
   Under federal law, no felon can legally buy a gun.
   Purdy pleaded guilty in 1983 to possessing martial arts weapons,
which were wooden bars connected with chains, according to Al
Albergate in the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. He
was jailed for five days.
   Purdy also was charged with possession of marijuana, receiving
stolen property and prostitution, but police said charges either
were dropped or they did not know the disposition of the case.
   Stockton police also said Purdy was charged with robbery and the
manufacture or sale of an illegal weapon, but prosecutors in Los
Angeles were not aware of the charges or their outcome.
   ``This is a person who should never be able to buy a weapon. It's
too late for the children who are dead and dying,'' said Gerald
Arenberg of the National Association of Chiefs of Police.
   A referedum to ban handguns will apparently be on the April 4
ballot in Winnetka, Ill., where an emotionally disturbed babysitter,
Laurie Dann, 30, went on a rampage May 20 at the Hubbard Woods
Elementary School.
   She killed an 8-year-old boy and wounded five other children
before killing herself. She had three handguns she bought at a local
shop.
   ``We've got to stop this,'' said Christine Munroe, a parent who
led a petition drive to have handguns banned. ``I've always been
against handguns. Their only purpose is to kill another person. I
don't want anybody threatening my children.''
   No gun control bans were proposed in Greenwood, S.C., where James
Wilson, a 19-year-old with psychiatric problems, killed two students
and wounded seven pupils and two teachers. Wilson used a .22 caliber
revolver he took from his grandmother.
   The California shootings revived anguish among school officials.
   ``People who have emotional problems and want to take revenge on
society are picking on our most vulnerable point, our children,''
said school superintendent Robert Watson of Greenwood.
   ``Small children are concentrated in groups. They don't run very
fast. They can't get away. Principals and teachers aren't much of a
match for someone with a gun.''

<HEAD>FBI Reportedly Investigating Chicago Commodity Exchanges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   FBI agents posing as commodities traders have
obtained evidence of widespread fraud involving millions of dollars
at the nation's two largest futures exchanges, a newspaper reported
today.
   Investigators believe the traders cheated customers of millions
of dollars in the execution of buy and sell orders at the exchanges,
which deal in a variety of contracts for future delivery of grains,
livestock, Treasury bonds, foreign currencies and other commodities,
the Chicago Tribune reported.
   The investigation focused on 50 to 100 brokers, floor traders and
commodity executives at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, the newspaper said, quoting anonymous sources.
   Hundreds of conversations were secretly tape recorded on the
exchanges' trading floors during a two-year period, the newspaper
said.
   ``We're talking about a ton of money on this thing,'' one source
told the newspaper.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas and FBI spokesmen in Washington and
Chicago refused to comment or acknowledge the investigation.
   Trades were rigged to prevent customers from getting fair-market
prices, and brokers allegedly sent false reports to customers to
hide that profits had been skimmed and that overcharges were made on
commissions.
   The Tribune said Valukas went to Washington on Friday to brief
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on the investigation.
   The newspaper said several subpoenas were served Wednesday, but
any arrests or indictments were at least a month away.
   ``We have received no official call or notification by a federal
agency or the U.S. attorney's office,'' a Board of Trade official
told the Tribune.
   Officials at the Mercantile Exchange said they did not know if
any subpoenas were delivered to traders there, and refused further
comment.

<HEAD>Magazine Thriving Under Glasnost Comes Under Fire In Leading Newspapers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magazine that blossomed under glasnost and ran
stories this week on corruption, pollution and suicide has come
under attack in two leading newspapers, indicating some leading
Communist officials may be getting fed up.
   Seven prominent cultural figures, in a letter published Wednesday
in the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda, bitterly attacked the
magazine Ogonyok, saying it went ``far outside the bounds of
literary arguments.''
   Those signing the letter, including conservative writers Valentin
Rasputin and Vasily Belov, said they supported ``with all their
souls'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms but had become
alarmed by ``scum bubbling up on the crest of the mighty stream of
renovation.''
   Izvestia, the government's afternoon newspaper, ran its own
correspondent's article Wednesday that cast doubt on Ogonyok's
credibility.
   He also wondered aloud why Ogonyok's editor-in-chief, Vitaly
Korotich, was trying to run in a Moscow neighborhood for a seat in a
new national assembly, the Council of People's Deputies, to be
elected in March.
   Izvestia correspondent A. Stepovoi said some Soviet social
organizations that are entitled to direct representation in the
assembly have already named Korotich as a candidate.
   The Ogonyok editor was seen by millions of U.S. television
viewers when CBS News anchorman Dan Rather visited with him in a
segment of the network's 1987 documentary on Soviet life, ``Seven
Days in May.''
   Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater openness, the
magazine has been transformed from a staid journal to a lively and
popular magazine.
   Ogonyok has drawn tough and insulting criticism from other Soviet
media before, but Pravda on Wednesday gave great prominence to its
critical letter, printing it above the fold on its back page. That
placement in the party's top daily could indicate high-level
irritation at Ogonyok.
   Many of the sensational revelations made by Soviet media under
glasnost have appeared in Ogonyok, whose title means small fire.
   In this week's issue, the slick magazine with more 3 million
subscribers nationwide revealed Soviet suicide statistics for recent
years, denounced pollution and ran the latest episode of an expose
on corruption and cronyism under the late Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev.
   Since the magazine has been one of the leaders in the drive for
franker discussion of social problems and a more honest
coming-to-grips with the country's past, any official attack on it
would be perceived by many Soviets as a signal of glasnost's limits.
   The seven cultural figures grouped Ogonyok along with Soviet
publications they said are engaged in an ``unprecedented distortion
of history, and that revise the social achievements of the people.''
   ``The magazine has taken upon itself the role of a kind of judge
on all questions of social life, politics, the economy, culture and
morals,'' they wrote.
   They accused it of printing unverified hearsay and of deprecating
Soviet cultural icons such as poet Vladimir Mayakovsky and Nobel
literature laureate Mikhail Sholokhov, author of ``And Quiet Flows
the Don.''

<HEAD>Panasonic Agrees to Repay Consumers in Price-Fix Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONALD POWERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 665,000 Panasonic customers victimized by a
nationwide price-fixing scheme are due as much as $16 million in
refunds from the Japanese consumer electronics giant, officials said.
   The settlement Panasonic agreed to Wednesday could be extended to
every state except Hawaii, New York State Attorney General Robert
Abrams told a news conference.
   Abrams said Panasonic cheated customers by illegally pressuring
thousands of retailers, including such major chains as K mart and
Montgomery Ward, to charge list price.
   ``There was an elaborate nationwide policing scheme whereby
certain retailers acted as stool pigeons, as rats, and they would
report that somebody down the street is charging less,'' said Lloyd
Constantine, chief of the attorney general's antitrust bureau.
   Abrams said other electronics manufacturers were being
investigated, but declined to identify them or say whether there
would be any charges.
   The settlement, in which Panasonic denied wrongdoing, was filed
in U.S. District Court.
   ``We voluntarily resolved the matter in the belief that a quick
settlement would help avoid protracted and costly litigation and
disruption to our dealers and our business,'' said Ralph Wolfe, vice
president of Panasonic, a division of Matsushita Electric Corp. of
America with headquarters in Secaucus, N.J.
   Abrams said the scheme involved 16 products sold under the
Panasonic and Technics labels, including videocassette recorders,
video cameras, cordless phones, answering machines and stereo
equipment.
   Panasonic agreed in the settlement to make refunds of at least
$8.5 million and up to $16 million to customers nationwide who
purchased its products between March 1 and Aug. 31 of last year.
   Panasonic prices were 5 percent to 10 percent higher on average
because of the scheme, Abrams said.
   ``In a few short months over $15 million was extorted from
consumers in the form of higher prices,'' he said.
   Abrams said Panasonic began fixing prices in March, but stopped
after six months when it learned of his investigation. The company
had planned to extend the scheme to include all its products, he
said.
   Panasonic coerced retailers into charging full list prices by
threatening to stop supplying stores that sold its products for less
than the suggested price, he said.
   The attorney general could not say how many retailers
participated, but said ``more retailers went along than opposed it.''
   Abrams' office learned of the scheme when an unidentified major
retailer that does business in New York ``bitterly complained'' it
was being pressured by Panasonic to strictly comply with price
guidelines, he said.
   Under the agreement, the retailers are not liable for any damages.
   Consumers who bought any of the products during the six-month
period and sent in warranty cards will be notified they are eligible
for a refund. Panasonic also agreed to publish newspaper
advertisements on obtaining refunds, Abrams said.
   Refunds on the overcharges will range from $45 for video cameras
to $17 for a cordless telephone.
   Under the agreement, attorneys general in all states except
Hawaii, where retailers deal with Asian-based Panasonic
subsidiaries, will have the option of adopting the settlement in
their state, Abrams said. Illinois and Maryland already have.
   If attorneys general representing at least 80 percent of
Panasonic consumers nationwide fail to adopt the agreement within 60
days either party can terminate the settlement.
   If that happens, Abrams said, New York would sue Panasonic.

<HEAD>Colombian Guerrillas Ambush, Kill 13 Judicial Commission Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judicial commission was ambushed by
leftist guerrillas in eastern Colombia and only two of its members
escaped alive, the army said. Two judges were among the 13 people
killed.
   ``It is an unprecedented attack on investigators who did not
constitute an attack force,'' Carlos Eduardo Lozano, director of
criminal judges, said of Wednesday's attack near the port city of
Barrancabermeja.
   The commission _ consisting of judges Mariela Morales, 35, and
Pablo Beltran, 40; two secretaries; nine judicial police officers
and two drivers _ was investigating the October 1987 disappearance
of 17 merchants and $235,000 in goods.
   The attackers set off dynamite charges under a road as two
vehicles carrying the party passed, then opened fire with automatic
weapons, army and police reports said.
   Two police officers escaped despite their wounds and were taken
to the hospital of the state-owned oil company Ecopetrol, where
officials said they were out of danger.
   Barrancabermeja, a port on the Magdalena River for oil shipments,
is Colombia's largest eastern city and lies 160 miles northeast of
the capital.
   Gen. Yanine Daz, commander of the army's 2nd Division, said from
the nearby city of Bucaramanga that the guerrillas belonged to the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a communist group.
   Police, however, blamed the attack on the Army of National
Liberation, a group inspired by Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   Both guerrilla groups operate in the region.

   Practicality may have made the classic
white nurses cap obsolete, but a doctor with a love of the past
brought them back for a day at Delta Medical Center's emergency room.
   ``I told the nurses one day that if they would wear their attire
that nurses used to wear 10, 15, 20 years ago, mainly the
traditional nurses cap, I'd dress up and buy them lunch,'' emergency
room physician David Merideth said.
   Five nurses did, so Meredith ordered a seafood lunch brought into
the emergency room last Friday.
   ``I didn't think they'd do that, but they held me to it,'' he
said.
   Merideth shucked the scrub greens that have become standard among
hospital medical staffs and put on whites _ complete with jacket and
tie.
   The nurses' white uniforms included caps representing their
nursing schools, except for one who had to borrow a cap for the
occasion.
   ``We don't think it's really practical to dress like this
everyday, although it looks better,'' Merideth said.

   Ram Chun survived being born in a Thai
refugee camp eight years ago, and she survived the hostility
Cambodian immigrants faced in their ``wonderful'' new country. But
she didn't survive Patrick Purdy.
   Ram's mother, Im Chun, spoke of her daughter's difficult life and
death as she stood in the doorway of her apartment with reddened
eyes Wednesday, a day after Purdy inexplicably killed Ram and four
other Southeast Asian children and wounded 30 people at the
Cleveland Elementary School before taking his own life.
   ``She said that all her family, her brothers got killed in
Cambodia by communists,'' said interpreter Setha Thach, who
translated for Im Chun. ``She thought she came here to live
peacefully, but something like this happens. ... Even $1 million
can't buy her child (back) that she lost.''
   Wednesday evening, more than 200 mourners gathered at a church
next door to the school where they heard the Lord's Prayer intoned
in Cambodian as thankful parents, whose children survived the
attack, clung to their youngsters.
   ``Chance, random fate and a very disturbed gunman ... have
brought grief, mourning and chaos to our city,'' said the Rev.
Arnold Vorster of Central United Methodist Church.
   ``Especially do we weep for our Southeast Asian brothers and
sisters ... for all children belong to the American family ... They
are our wealth and our future, for the bell tolls for us all.''
   Earlier in the day, many children stayed home from school despite
the urging of psychologists and the efforts of workers who spent the
night repairing bullet holes and removing blood stains from the
school grounds.
   ``My father said we couldn't go to school,'' said fifth-grader
Sokchea Thlang, who added that her father had cried when he heard
about the shootings. Three of his older children had died in
Cambodia and he feared Sokchea, her third-grader sister or
kindergartener brother had been shot. They were all uninjured.
   ``I thought when we came to the states of America, I thought we
would have a wonderful life and everything was going to be
exciting,'' said Sokchea.
   At first, she said, she thought the gunfire was firecrackers.
   ``Then my teacher looked out the door and she saw a man and two
girls lying on the ground,'' she said. ``My teacher started to cry.
Everybody got under the tables and everybody started to cry.''
   For Cambodian refugees who have settled locally, the schoolyard
massacre was particularly incomprehensible.
   At an apartment complex about six blocks from the school, young
children peered through the windows and raced bicycles on tiny yards
of compacted mud. Many of the women and girls wear colorful batik
sarongs. Thongs are the most common footwear. The teeth of some
women are stained with beetlenut, a plant popular as chewing gum
among Southeast Asians.
   ``I wonder why he wanted to kill,'' fifth-grader Och Sao mused,
noting that all five victims were from Southeast Asian refugee
families. ``I think he hated Cambodians or something.''
   Och said many Cambodian immigrants have met hostility in their
new country.
   Down the street, friends huddled around a space heater on woven
mats under framed snapshots of another victim, 6-year-old Sokhim An,
and her family. The parents weren't home. The girl's mother,
Korn-Ing, was hospitalized for shock after her daughter, the eldest
of three children, was killed, Thach said.
   ``They wonder why? What's happening to the Cambodians?'' neighbor
Moeun Loeung said through the interpreter.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Central American presidents have
agreed to hold a summit next month to try to advance a stalled
regional peace plan, President Daniel Ortega said.
   The Nicaraguan leader said in a statement late Wednesday that the
summit would be held Feb. 8-9 in the Salvadoran capital, San
Salvador.
   The summit was riginally scheduled for Jan. 15-16, but was
postponed after President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica suggested a
delay to allow President-elect George Bush time to formulate a
Central American policy.
   Arias authored the regional peace plan, which was signed in
Guatemala in August 1987 by the five presidents. The plan calls for
an end to civil wars in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua. It
also calls for movement toward democracy and political amnesties.
   Ortega's statement said foreign ministers from the region's
governments would meet in Managua to prepare an agenda for the
summit.
   The five presidents are Ortega, Arias, Jose Napoleon Duarte of El
Salvador, Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras and Vinicio Cerezo of
Guatemala.
   In another development, Costa Rican Public Security Minister
Hernan Garron charged late Wednesday that three Sandinista army
helicopters had violated Costa Rican airspace.
   Garron said the Nicaraguan helicopters flew over the Costa Rican
border posts of Las Delicias and El Cachito at about 5:00 p.m.
Wednesday. Las Delicias and El Cachito are about 55 miles north of
San Jose.
   A Nicaraguan Defense Ministry spokesman refused to comment on the
report Wednesday night. The spokesman, speaking on condition he not
be identified, said the Foreign Ministry possibly would comment
today.

   A military court has sentenced a U.S.
Air Force sergeant to two years in jail after convicting him of
stealing $9,000 worth of frozen T-bone steaks from the commissary at
his base, the Air Force said today.
   Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at the Clark air base, said Sgt.
Michael A. Lafayette also was given a forfeiture of $400 dollars a
month from his pay for two years and dishonorable discharge after
serving his prison term.
   The court martial ended on Jan. 10.
   Lafayette's age and hometown were not available. Crist said
Lafayette was assigned to the commissary at Clark, 50 miles north of
Manila.
   Two Filipino civilians were arrested along with Lafayette and are
being prosecuted before Philippine courts, Crist said in a telephone
interview from Clark. Several other Filipinos also were involved, he
added.
   Crist said Lafayette was apprehended on Aug. 1 when he was caught
stealing the steaks from cold storage. Crist said Lafayette had cut
off the seals of a freezer drawer and assisted his Filipino
companions in loading 60 cases of T-bone steaks in a jeep.
   Two of the Filipinos tried to get away with the jeep but were
caught by guards at one of the base's gates, Crist said.
   The stolen steaks apparently were intended for sale on the black
market. Although steaks are sold in most supermarkets in the
Philippines, many Filipinos, especially the wealthy, prefer American
products.

   Super Bowl glitz and glitter are a tonic for civic
pride.
   The week gives a city a chance to bask in the glare of
international media attention.
   The tonic of Super Bowl XXIII, however, is a bittersweet brew.
The concoction prepared and tested over the years by the National
Football League with the care of a master chef has been soured by a
helping of ghetto violence.
   Oh, the hype and hoopla are in full swing, but they have been
tempered by the sounds of gunshots and of rocks striking metal and
glass and flesh.
   A twisted ankle on a practice field is insignificant when
newspaper headlines scream about violent death on streets not far
from that field.
   While the Super Bowl crowd guzzles cocktails, molotov cocktails
have flamed through the night in poor sections of this city, which
is no stranger to violent outbreaks.
   Tonight, the huge media corps will be given a party by the Miami
Super Bowl XXIII Host Committee, and it will be wined and dined
Friday by the NFL.
   Sixto Mendez had stocked his meat market with $25,000 worth of
meat and other supplies in anticipation of parties over Super Bowl
weekend.
   Wednesday, he cleaned up what was left after the looting of the
store in the Overtown section, where violence first flared after the
fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by a white policeman.
   ``What has happened has shifted the emphasis from the Super Bowl
to the community,'' said Dick Anderson, a former defensive back with
the Miami Dolphins and a member of the city's the host committee.
   ``The timing is so incredible considering all the time and energy
these people have put into the game,'' NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle
said.
   Violence isn't programmed, but in our society it has become the
rule rather than the exception.
   It was the third violent racial disturbance in Overtown in six
years.
   ``People want answers to what's happening,'' said Cincinnati wide
receiver Eddie Brown, who grew up in Overtown. ``The big problem in
the city is there is nothing to do'' for young people.
   It's a problem not unique to Miami.
   Anderson felt that the situation began to change for better after
numerous `rrests Tuesday night when violence spread to the Liberty
City and Coconut Grove areas.
   ``Since the police took the offensive and arrested looters,
things have calmed down,'' he said.
   Anderson felt that attendance at the game at Joe Robbie Stadium
would not be affected.
   ``I think the stadium has superb security,'' Anderson said.
   ``If you know of anybody who's afraid to use their tickets, I'll
buy them. If they're people who don't want to come, I'm sure there
are people in Miami who would buy their tickets.''
   A ticket to a better life are what Sixto Mendez and others whose
businesses and homes were destroyed would like.
   The game will be played with all the usual fanfare and it will be
watched by a zillion people on television.
   The winners will parade through the streets of Cincinnati or San
Francisco. The television ratings will be seen by the NFL as the
latest assurance of its high place on the American scene.
   Overtown, Liberty City and Coconut Grove will become footnotes _
three unwanted guests who, at least for a time, put a damper on
America's biggest sporting party.

<HEAD>Brain Defects Found In Many Molesters, Sadists And Rare Type Of Rapist</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many child molesters and sadists suffer
subtle damage in the parts of the brain responsible for sexual
fantasy, possibly explaining the source of their abnormal urges, a
study suggests.
   And a separate study of a rare kind of rapist found abnormalities
in the part of the brain that allows conscience to control
instinctive emotions. The men were loners who committed their crimes
during sudden brain seizures without anger or motive.
   Both studies were presented Wednesday during a session on the
biological roots of instinctive behavior at the annual meeting of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   They suggest that disorders in primitive circuits in the brain
play a role in certain cases of abnormal sexual behavior, said
Donald Pfaff, professor of neurology and behavior as Rockefeller
University in New York.
   The first study, of 400 men, found abnormalities in the portions
of temporal lobes _ the part of the brain near the ears _ in 40
percent of the sadists and half the child molesters, said Ron
Langevin, senior research psychologist at the University of
Toronto's Clarke Institute of Psychiatry.
   Langevin said the temporal lobes are involved in memories,
recognizing patterns and triggering sexual fantasies to arouse the
limbic system, the more primitive part of the brain that helps
regulate emotions.
   While the study suggests ``where does the unusual sexual behavior
come from, ... it's never going to be a defense'' for accused child
molesters or violent sex offenders because they still have a
capability to recognize their urges and control them, Langevin said.
   Other factors, including frequent alcohol and drug abuse and
family upbringing can play a role in whether a person who has
sadistic or pedophiliac impulses acts on them, he added.
   Yet he acknowledged the impulses to sex crime must be powerful
because so many offenders repeat their acts despite guilt, therapy
and a desire to change.
   The other study _ by Dr. Anneliese Pontius, a Harvard University
associate clnical professor of psychiatry _ dealt with two offenders
who committed their crimes without premeditation, feeling or anger,
and who remembered their acts despite hallucinations:
   _A teenager who tried to rape a 72-year-old woman after he had a
brain seizure when the woman's gait reminded him of his mother, who
used to lock him in his room.
   _A father in his 20s who was charged with rape because, while
babysitting his son's playmate, he suddenly performed oral sex on
the 6-year-old despite no history of pedophilia or homosexuality.
   Various neurological and brain-imaging tests found abnormalities
in both men's frontal lobes, the third of the brain that is most
evolved and plays a role in conceiving, planning and executing an
action, and thinking about the consequences, Pontius said.
   Her theory is that in the two men, the frontal lobes' capability
for conscience was defective, and also overwhelmed by seizures in
the limbic system, where basic emotions are mediated.
   The youth who attacked the woman suffered what Pontius calls a
limbic psychotic trigger reaction in which the sight of the old
woman's gait flooded his mind with a vivid memory of the repeated
abuse by his mother.
   The child rapist had limbic seizures from temporal lobe epilepsy,
which is much different than the common form of epilepsy. He had a
history of birth defects, head injuries and seizures.
   ``I got them through the court as not guilty by reason of
insanity,'' Pontius, emphasizing that very few sex offenders have
such defects.
   Langevin detected the subtle stuctural abnormalities in molesters
and sadists with CAT scans of the brain, patterns of brain
electrical activity and neuropsychological tests to detect physical
movements that correlate with brain injuries.
   The study was complicated by the fact that one-third to half the
sadists and pedophiles used alcohol or drugs, which can cause brain
damage, and the sadists had a violent life style. But Langevin said
he was able to distinguish such injury from the damage in the
temporal lobes. The cause of those abnormalities are unknown,
Langevin said.
   He defined the sadists as people who prefer to humiliate, injure
and sometimes kill others.

   Two military school cadets admitted donning
rented police uniforms to hold up an armored car, then escaping with
$4.5 million in a heist planned by the father of one of the cadets,
authorities said.
   The Virginia Military Institute cadets were arrested Wednesday on
campus.
   ``We're all just in shock, of course,'' said Col. Leroy Hammond
of Virginia Military Institute of Lexington, Va. ``It's just so
completely uncharacteristic of the young men we have here. We're
particularly proud of our honor system here, our young men's
integrity.''
   Also arrested Wednesday was Robert J. Jasinski, 51, of Boonton,
who worked as a part-time driver for the Coin Depot Armored Car
Corp. of Elizabeth.
   His son, William T. Jasinski, 22, and Bryan Smals, 21, of
Columbus, Ohio, rented police uniforms from a costume store while on
their Christmas vacation and held up the armored car, said John
McGinley, head of the FBI's Newark office.
   McGinley told a news conference that the elder Jasinski met the
hijacked armored car in a rented rt of in a stupor now. When you think
somebody is
trying to help him and be good to him and then they turn him around
like this. This is stunning ... I don't know how they got to him.''
   Hammond said Wednesday night he could not understand the actions
of the two cadets, adding, ``They've both been anonymous as cadets.''

<UNK>Eastern Jet Makes Emergency Descent After Losing Pressure</UNK>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Eastern Airlines DC-9 with 68 people aboard
lost cabin pressure and was forced to drop 26,000 feet, the
carrier's second pressurization problem in a month.
   Flight 753 was traveling from Cleveland to Atlanta on Wednesday
when it was forced to go to a lower altitude over northeast Georgia.
No injuries were reported, said Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   A sensor problem caused the plane to lose pressure, the airline
said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation
Safety Board were investigating the incident, which followed the
Dec. 26 emergency landing of an Eastern Boeing 727 in Charleston,
W.Va. That plane lost pressure after a 10-by-20-inch hole opened in
the fuselage. There also were no major injuries in that incident.
   The FAA earlier this month directed airlines to step up
inspections of the DC-9 fleet, which has an average age of 18.18
years. The directive followed the agency's discovery of cracks in
more than 20 planes during a special inspection.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said Wednesday's problem had
little to do with the plane's age. A sensor apparently
malfunctioned, erroneously setting the pressure for a lower
altitude, he said.
   ``The sensor in effect tells the plane what altitude it's at, and
that sensor device apparently malfunctioned,'' he said. ``This is
the type of thing that could happen on a plane one hour off the
production line. It's simply a mechanical malfunction.''
   During the descent from 35,000 to 9,000 feet, the oxygen masks
dropped for the passengers.

   Hundreds of leftist demonstrators hurling rocks and
bottles battled West Berlin police outside a right-wing party
meeting and at least 95 officers were injured, officials said today.
   Police said eight demonstrators were arrested, but there was no
word on how many were injured.
   The violence occurred late Wednesday outside a convention center
where Republican party members were planning for the city's Jan. 29
elections.
   The party, which officials estimate has a membership of about
250, has been conducting a campaign against foreigners living in
West Berlin, and advocates expelling non-Germans from West Germany.
   About 6,500 demonstrators, mostly from leftist groups, gathered
to protest the meeting and a recent decision by city officials to
list the Republican party on the ballot, police said.
   The clashes began when the demonstrators threw rocks, bottles,
fireworks and other objects at police manning security barriers set
up to keep protesters out of the congress center, police said in a
statement.
   Police used tear gas and clubs to break up the protests, which
stretched into the late evening hours and spread to a nearby
shopping area.
   Windows in the shopping area were smashed and several vehicles,
including a police squad car, were damaged by the demonstrators,
police said. There was no immediate estimate of the damage.
   Eleven of the injured police were hospitalized for treatment.

   A grocer who shot to death two armed robbers in
his store said he hoped he would never have to use his unregistered
handgun but he had no choice and would do so again.
   ``I don't feel good that I had to do it,'' Ramon Guzman said
Wednesday.
   ``This is a lesson to the robber on the street,'' said the
35-year-old Guzman, who bought the .38-caliber handgun three years
ago. ``They will think twice before doing something like this
again.''
   Three men armed with two handguns and a shotgun entered the
Rainbow Mini-Mart in the Bronx on Tuesday night and announced a
holdup, police said.
   One of the holdup men aimed a shotgun at the grocer and warned,
``Don't move or I'll blow your head off,'' Guzman recalled.
   As a second man with a pistol came around the counter, Guzman
reached for his own gun and fired twice, hitting the man in the face
and arm, the grocer recalled.
   Guzman said he turned and saw the man with the shotgun raise the
weapon. He said he fired his gun twice more, hitting the robber. The
third robber fled.
   ``I reacted on instinct,'' Guzman said.
   Guzman was charged with illegal possession of a weapon, a
misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail. The district
attorney's office will convene a grand jury to determine whether
Guzman's use of the gun was justified.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau, Jr.
visited the PLO's representative in Tunisia earlier this week, his
first such call on PLO offices, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said today.
   The visit on Tuesday to the offices of Hakam Balawi was a return
call for a visit Balawi paid on the ambassador at the start of the
new year, Embassy spokesman Richard Undeland told The Associated
Press.
   He was confirming PLO reports of such a visit.
   Undeland would not specify whether the visit was purely a
courtesy call or whether discussions took place.
   Pelletreau first met with a delegation of the Palestine
Liberation Organization on Dec. 16, the first such official talks
since PLO chief Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist.
   Undeland said he was unaware of a date for those talks to resume.
   A member of the PLO executive committee, Yasser Abderabou, said
Wednesday that they would resume ``in the coming weeks.''
President-elect Bush is sworn in on Friday.
   Asked about the remark, Undeland added that he was ``not ruling
out anything.''
   Abderabou, speaking on a regional Tunisian radio, said a PLO
delegation would meet in Madrid with foreign ministers from Spain,
France and Greece on Jan. 26, when a European peace plan for the
Middle East would be unveiled.

   Mick Jagger, nattily dressed and short-haired,
stood on a stage at the Waldorf-Astoria and reflected humbly on his
passage from irreverent ``bad boy'' to revered relic in the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame.
   ``Tonight we're on our best behavior and we're being rewarded for
25 years of bad behavior,'' the Rolling Stones' leader said
Wednesday night at the fourth annual induction ceremony, at which
Dion, Otis Redding, Stevie Wonder and the Temptations also entered
the Hall of Fame.
   Along with a rare appearence by the reclusive Phil Spector, who
was inducted into the Hall's non-performer category, Jagger sounded
the evening's high note when he promised in his acceptance speech,
``We're not quite ready to hang up the number yet.''
   The theme of a Stones reunion was taken up by the Who's Pete
Townsend, who in inducting the group alternately teased and praised
them, concluding, ``Don't try to grow old gracefully. It wouldn't
suit you.''
   ``Will the Stones ever work again? If it wasn't for the vast sums
they can make, they might not bother,'' Townsend said. ``Luckily for
us fans then that Mick has such expensive tastes.''
   ``No more gags. The Stones are the greatest. Although they're all
friends, I'm still a fan.''
   The four Stones present _ Jagger, Keith Richards, one-time Stone
Mick Taylor and his replacement Ron Wood _ participated in an
after-midnight jam session of inductees and presenters that followed
the awards.
   At one point, Richards played guitar directly behind Jagger, but
the two, who've rarely been on stage together in recent years,
didn't perform face to face. Jagger sang with Tina Turner and Little
Richard, both presenters.
   Bruce Springsteen, who was not part of the ceremonies, sang
``Crying'' in tribute to Roy Orbison, a previous Hall of Fame
inductee who died late last year.
   Wonder, inducted by Paul Simon, was accompanied on stage by his
son and daughter. He said his selection made him want to ``forever,
till we die, give as much as we can.''
   Daryl Hall and John Oates introduced the Temptations by striking
up ``Don't Look Back,'' when five Temptations came on and took up
the tune. The five original members, Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin,
Eddie Kendricks, the late Paul Williams and David Ruffin, were
inducted along with new member Dennis Edwards.
   ``This is about the past blending into the present,'' said Hall.
   To be eligible for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,
musicians must have made recordings more than 25 years ago. The
inductees were picked by more than 150 performers, producers,
writers, record executives and broadcasters. A building is to be
built in Cleveland, with a projected opening in 1992.
   Dion, who named his group the Belmonts after a Bronx avenue, was
inducted by Lou Reed and evinced delight at his selection, calling
it ``amazing.''
   ``Rock 'n' roll has sure changed since my heyday,'' said the
singer, who has a record coming out in March. ``I think, all told,
`The Wanderer' made me a little over $14,000. Over there, Bruce has
$42 million on him. I'm joking around. You guys don't know what this
means to me.''
   Little Richard was, as usual, outrageous as he inducted the late
Otis Redding.
   He called Redding ``a pillar of rock 'n' roll. The first time I
heard him since `Lucille' I thought it was me. He was one of the
greatest singers and composers that ever lived and that is including
me, Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, James Brown.''
   Redding died in a plane crash Dec. 10, 1967, while on tour. His
widow, Selma, accepted his statue.
   Ms. Turner inducted Specter, the celebrated record producer who
defined a musical style with early '60s hits like ``Da Doo Ron Ron''
and ``And Then He Kissed Me.'' Living up to a reputation for
eccentricity, he arrived on stage surrounded by three bodyguards and
departed with them, without pausing for photographs.
   This year's inductees as pre-rock influences on rock and roll
were the late Bessie Smith, whose son Jack Gee and granddaughter
Beverly Clark were present; the Ink Spots, with the widows of Ivory
Watson and Bill Kenny accepting; and the Soul Stirrers, a gospel
group founded in 1934.

<TEXT>
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat today called
for more confrontation in the 13-month Palestinian uprising to
counter harsher tactics by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   In a statement issued by the PLO news agency Wafa in Nicosia,
Arafat addressed ``The Unified National Command'' of the uprising
and ``popular committees, students in schools and universities, and
residents of (refugee) camps and towns and villages.''
   Israel, Arafat said, has escalated its ``Iron Fist'' policy to
try to crush the rebellion, ``forgetting that our people had decided
from the beginning to continue the uprising until the end of the
occupation.''
   ``So let us have more confrontation against the Zionist
occupation and the Fascist hordes of murderous settlers.
   ``In our steadfastness and faith, the enemy faces its inevitable
dilemma, from which the way out is the retreat of its forces from
the occupied lands,'' Arafat said.
   During the uprising, or intefadeh in Arabic, which began in
December 1987, Palestinians have attacked Israeli soldiers and
Jewish settlers with stones and firebombs and, in rare instances,
with guns and knives.
   At least 362 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel on Tuesday announced
tougher measures to deal with the uprising, including increasing the
number of soldiers authorized to shoot at demonstrators and allowing
soldiers to fire plastic or rubber bullets at stone-throwers as they
flee.
   Israeli leaders have blamed the increase in violence in the
occupied lands on the U.S. decision last month to talk with the PLO,
saying the opening of the dialogue encourages protesters because it
makes them think their actions bring political gains.
   The United States decided to open talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization after Arafat publicly renounced terrorism
and acknowledged Israel's right to exist.
   Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war
and 1.7 million Palestinians uneasily share the territories with
70,000 Jewish settlers.

<HEAD>Acclaimed Writer Bruce Chatwin Dead At 48</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bruce Chatwin, a travel writer and novelist who
authored the acclaimed book ``In Patagonia,'' died in the French
resort of Nice from a rare bone marrow disease he contracted in
China, his family reported. He was 48.
   Despite suffering from the debilitating disease caused by a plant
fungus that eventually confined him to a wheelchair, Chatwin
recently completed his sixth book, a collection of writings called
``What Am I Doing Here?''
   It is to be published later this year.
   In a 1987 interview, Chatwin said he contracted the ailment
during a trip to western China, dismissing the disease that killed
him Wednesday with the comment, ``Hazards of travel _ rather an
alarming one.''
   His British agent, Gillon Aitken, said today, ``He had been
staying at a friend's house, became very ill and was taken to a
hospital in Nice, where he died. He'd been ill for about three
years, with a viral disease from China, and died from that.''
   The London newspaper The Daily Telegraph called him one of the
most remarkable writers of the last dozen years. In a relatively
brief career as a writer, he published five books, three of them
novels.
   After becoming an expert on Impressionist art, Chatwin gave up
his job with a major auction house at age 24 to study anthropology
and embark on the travels that inspired his books.
   He based ``In Patagonia'' on a trek through southern Argentina
and Chile, ``The Viceroy of Ouidah'' on West Africa, ``On the Black
Hill'' on the Welsh hills where he bought a house, ``The Songlines''
on travels in Australia and his most recent, ``Utz,'' on Prague's
art world.
   A private man and spare writer, he combined an obsession with
nomadic peoples with elements of fiction and realism and an original
method of composition compared by critics to film cross-cutting and
merging.
   Born in 1940 the son of a naval officer, Chatwin's first years
were restless as he and his mother followed his father's minesweeper
around Britain.
   He went to several boarding schools, skipped college and joined
Sotheby's auction house as a trainee. Within six years, he was head
of their Impressionist department _ the youngest person to hold the
post.
   At 24, Chatwin told an interviewer, he left the house ``out of
sheer boredom. Works of art are much tougher than those handling
them, who crumbled before your eyes.''
   He enrolled at Edinburgh University to study anthropology and
archaeology before embarking on his first travels. In 1965, he
married the American daughter of an admiral, Elizabeth Chanler.
   ``In Patagonia'' was published in 1977 and followed his solitary
journey through the southern tip of South America. It brought him
instant recognition as a writer.
   The book, based on his fascination with people there and their
stories, welded truth and imagination.
   Chatwin dubbed the technique ``searches'' _ an imaginative
mixture of anthropology, history, biography and fiction. The book
won both the Somerset Maugham and E.M. Forster literary awards.
   ``The Viceroy of Ouidah,'' published in 1980 and set in 19th
century West Africa, also showed his disregard for conventional
methods of writing. It won the Whitbread literary award.
   ``On the Black Hill,'' set in rural Wales, followed in 1982 and
was made into a movie of the same name in 1987. ``The Songlines,' an
expansive account of Australian Aboriginal creation myths, was
published in 1987.
   ``Utz,'' a novel about the psychopathology of the compulsive art
collector, was published last week.
   At that time, he was quoted by The New York Times Book Review as
saying that, for him, travel had become a form of tyranny. ``As you
go along, you literally collect places,'' he said. ``I'm fed up with
going places. I shan't go to anymore.''
   Fair-haired, with good looks and a penetrating gaze, Chatwin once
remarked in an interview: ``What interested me most were the people
who had escaped the archaeological record _ the nomads who trod
lightly on the earth and didn't build pyramids.''
   Insatiably curious about others, Chatwin refused to give personal
details about himself for reference books and was rarely
interviewed. Even a television program about him and his writing
showed him as singularly unforthcoming.
   He is survived by his wife.

<HEAD>Study Questions Feasibility Of Nuclear Power For `Star Wars'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major technical obstacles block development
of orbiting nuclear reactors that would be powerful enough for
``Star Wars'' weapons, the National Research Council said, as other
scientists urged a ban on such devices.
   The Pentagon, which requested the report, called the reactors
essential and said the document was unduly pessimistic.
   One obstacle to the kinds of nuclear reactors now under
consideration is they would be too heavy, said the 140-page report.
   ``At these projected masses (of hundreds of tons), the
feasibility of space power systems needed for high-power SDI
concepts appears impractical from both cost and launch
considerations,'' the report said.
   The report said a smaller and more powerful system is needed.
   The United States has no working reactors in orbit, but the
government is developing one that by the mid-1990s is to deliver
between 10,000 and 100,000 watts of electricity, still far short of
what's needed to power the weapons.
   The report said the power needed for SDI weapons would range from
tens of millions to hundreds of millions of watts ``and beyond.''
   ``The conclusion of the panel was there's a lot of work that has
to be done before a practical, operating, high-power system is
feasible'' to provide electricity for ``Star Wars,'' or Strategic
Defense Initiative weapons, said Joseph G. Gavin Jr., chairman of
the council committee that wrote the report. The council is part of
the National Academy of Sciences.
   Gavin, former president of Grumman Corp. and the man responsible
for designing and building the Appollo lunar module, released the
report at a news conference Wednesday during the annual meeting of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Col. George Hess, technology director for the Pentagon's SDI
Office, said the United States must build advanced space reactors
because the nation's future as a spacefaring nation in the next
century depends on large amounts of power.
   ``We're developing a technology for which there is no historic
precedent,'' said Richard L. Verga, head of power development for
the office. ``We can do better than that report indicates. We're
pretty bullish.''
   Gavin's report said the United States should design two
substantially different power systems, nuclear and chemical, to
determine if they would work for Star Wars. It said existing
concepts for such power plants ``do not adequately address questions
of survivability, reliability, maintainability and operation
readiness.''
   The Gavin panel also urged the government to re-review the
possibility of generating electricity on Earth and beaming it to
orbiting weapons platforms.
   University of California, Santa Cruz, scientists Daniel Hirsch
and Joel Primack reiterated a demand made last year by groups of
U.S. and Soviet scientists to ban reactors within the Earth's orbit,
but permit reactors to power spacecraft headed for the moon or
beyond.
   Such a ban would protect the planet from radioactive
contamination when spacecraft fall to Earth, end disruption of
satellite data and put an end to star wars, they said.
   Primack, a physicist, said the Soviets now have 33 reactors in
orbit on radar satellites tracking U.S. naval forces, plus two
powerful Topaz reactors, whose existence was revealed by Soviet
scientists at a meeting in New Mexico this month.
   Hirsch, who directs the university's nuclear policy program, said
15 percent of all nuclear-powered spacecraft have suffered failures,
including the U.S. SNAP-9A plutonium unit that failed to reach orbit
in 1964 and spread plutonium over the planet when it burned up in
the atmosphere. The Soviet Cosmos 954 reactor spread radioactive
debris over a wide area of Canada on re-entry in 1978.
   Hess said the successful Soviet effort to prevent the
reactor-powered Cosmos 1900 from falling to Earth last year shows
reactors can be operated safely.

   A man accused of abandoning his 7-year-old
retarded son at a freeway rest stop told a detective he probably
would have killed the boy if he hadn't deserted him, a prosecutor
says.
   Edward Tuinman, 29, and his 28-year-old wife, Deborah, were
arraigned in state court Wednesday on a felony child abandonment
charge in the case of their son, Eddy, who was found at an
Interstate 84 exit near here Jan. 4.
   Tuinman told Detective Ken Smith ``it was either leave him or
kill him,'' Ada County Deputy Prosecutor Daniel Miller told
Magistrate Lewis Woods on Wednesday. Tuinman said anything the boy
did bothered him, Miller said.
   Eddy, battered and wearing only a urine-soaked T-shirt, was found
by two truck drivers, authorities said.
   ``He reached out to whoever was around,'' said Miller. ``He had
bruises all over his body, cigarette burns all over his body ... He
had a broken nose.''
   The boy, who cannot speak, was transferred to an Idaho foster
home after treatment at St. Luke's Regional Medical Center in Boise.
   His parents, who were originally from the Salt Lake City area and
were believed to have been traveling in search of a job, were
arrested in Nephi, Utah, three days after the boy was found.
   Public defender Mark Stewart asked Woods via closed-circuit
television Wednesday to lower the $50,000 bond on Mrs. Tuinman,
saying she lives on welfare and has no prior criminal record.
   Miller requested a higher bond, saying there was risk the couple
would leave the county.
   Woods let the bond stand. Tuinman's bond is also $50,000.
   Mrs. Tuinman requested a public attorney, but her husband said he
did not need one. Asked if had read the complaint against him,
Tuinman said he could not read.
   Woods scheduled a preliminary hearing for Jan. 31 for the couple,
who were being held in the Ada County Jail.
   If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to 14 years in
prison, Miller said.
   Three other Tuinman children are in protective custody in Utah,
officials said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry has been subpoenaed to
appear before a federal grand jury after failing to respond to an
``invitation'' to testify about his latest troubles, according to a
published report.
   Barry will be questioned about his visits last month with a drug
suspect and about a $260,000 personnel project involving the city
and the U.S. Virgin Islands that the man was supervising, according
to today's editions of The Washington Post.
   Barry has hired a criminal defense attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy,
who told the Post the mayor is not a target of the federal
investigation.
   ``We're not resisting the subpoena at all,'' Mundy said. ``We're
simply working out with the U.S. attorney's office a schedule for
his appearance.
   ``The mayor is merely a witness,'' he said.
   The Post, quoting unidentified sources, said U.S. Attorney Jay B.
Stephens of the District of Columbia sent a letter to Barry asking
him to testify but the mayor did not respond within two weeks.
   Federal officials are investigating the city's handling of a
probe of a drug suspect, former city employee Charles Lewis, whom
Barry visited several times last month at a downtown Washington
hotel. Barry was with Lewis Dec. 22 when, according to published
reports, two undercover police officers on the way to his hotel room
turned back after learning the mayor was inside.
   Barry's physician, Dr. Vincent Roux, also said Wednesday that the
mayor was drug-free, according to the mayor's press secretary, John
White.
   White told The Washington Times that tests were conducted for 10
drugs, including PCP, cocaine, heroin and marijuana. Roux told the
newspaper a drug test was ``not standard,'' but Barry requested it.
   The written results of the tests were given to two local radio
stations, WOL and WHUR. ``That is the way Mr. Barry wanted the
information released to the community,'' White said, refusing to
elaborate.
   Investigators are also examining possible improper spending of
public funds in a project Lewis was supervising for the Virgin
Islands government. Several city officials, including Barry, took
expensive trips to the islands as part of a consulting contract to
help revamp the personnel system there.
   According to the Post, the grand jury has subpoenaed police
records of telephone calls and radio transmissions for the week
covering the hotel incident. The grand jury began probing the hotel
incident and the personnel project on Jan. 6.
   It is not yet known when Barry was called to testify.

   In three days last week, the justice minister of
this cautious, conservative country resigned in shame, a general was
suspended for accepting a free trip, and a prominent legislator was
convicted of fraud.
   Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that public funds were used
illegally to affect the outcome of a regional election six years ago.
   Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp's appointment in 1984 was
enormously popular. She became the first woman member of the Swiss
Cabinet only 13 years after women gained the right to vote.
   A week ago, Jan. 11, a special prosecutor said Mrs. Kopp was
suspected of passing to her husband official secrets about an
investigation of possible drug-money laundering by a company of
which he was a board member.
   ``An un-Swiss scenario, but it happened in Switzerland,'' the
mass-circulation newspaper Sonntagsblick declared. ``This is how far
we've come.''
   Neue Zuercher Zeitung, a conservative paper close to the Swiss
establishment, said ``a national crisis'' might have resulted ``if
the fire had smoldered on.''
   The case of Mrs. Kopp focuses attention on Switzerland's role as
international financial hub, with the attendant risk of handling
illegal money, and women's roles in the nation's politics.
   She is accused of secretly warning her husband, also a lawyer, in
October to cut his ties with a Zurich company because it was being
investigated.
   Hans W. Kopp gave up his post on the board of Shakarchi Trading
AG, a Lebanese-controlled company, and prosecutors said a few days
later the company may have been involved in Switzerland's biggest
money-laundering case. No charges have been filed and the company
denied involvement.
   After the first reports in December that her husband was tipped
from inside the Justice Ministry, Mrs. Kopp said she would resign at
the end of February.
   Then came the special prosecutor's report last week, showing she
had concealed some facts, and she quit the same day. Mrs. Kopp has
insisted throughout, however, that she did no wrong.
   Her husband has had trouble before.
   He was chairman of a financial services company that collapsed in
1982 and was investigated for fraud and falsification of documents.
In 1971, he was temporarily suspended from the Zurich Bar
Association following allegations of improper conduct that never
were officially explained.
   A recent public opinion poll revealed concern among the Swiss
about ties between government and business. Of those responding, 52
percent said people who serve in Parliament, a part-time job in
Switzerland, should not sit on company boards at the same time.
   The justice minister always publicly defended her husband, but
Sonntagsblick said: ``Elisabeth Kopp's conduct is not that of a
perturbed, loving wife. It is that of a coolly calculating lawyer:
always admit only what can immediately be proven.''
   Mrs. Kopp's successor is expected to be a man, but the Swiss
insist her fall will not affect opportunities for women in top
political ranks.
   Neue Zuercher Zeitung said: ``The events leading to the
resignation are so singular that they do not permit general
conclusions.''
   The military, a cornerstone of Swiss society, was tarnished the
same day the minister resigned by suspension of the air force chief
of staff for letting a domestic aircraft manufacturer pay for a
two-week trip to Australia.
   Officials said Brig. Gen. Alfred Ramseyer was under investigation
for bribery. He has reimbursed the company for the trip.
   Two days later, on Jan. 13, a chief organizer of the 1987 Alpine
Ski World Championships in Crans-Montana resigned from Parliament
after a court sentenced him to two years probation for fraud.
   Hubert Bonvin, a leading politician in tourism-oriented Valais
canton, was convicted of bilking it of $20,644 by taking a salary as
vice president of the organizing committee while on paid sick leave
from his job as a high school teacher.
   While the Kopp affair was developing, the Supreme Court ordered a
repeat of a 1983 referendum in the German-speaking Laufen district
that kept it in Bern canton, or state, instead of moving it into
Basel canton.
   It said a secret payment of $210,000 by the Bern state government
to a pro-Bern committee may have determined the outcome.
   The Laufen vote was an indirect result of a national referendum
in 1978 that created French-speaking Jura canton from territory in
German-speaking Bern.

   US Possesses Tape of Reported Arafat Threat
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department says it has obtained a
tape recording of Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, threatening anyone who tries to stifle the
uprising on the Israeli-held West Bank.
   According to spokesman Charles E. Redman, the PLO leader said
last week: ``Whoever thinks of stopping the intefadah before it
achieve its goals, I will give him 10 bullets in the chest.''
   Intefadah is the Arabic word for the 13-month uprising by
Palestinians against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Redman said Wednesday that Arafat has since denied he intended
any threat against Elias Freij, the mayor of Bethlehem who is
considered a moderate Palestinian and was the purported target.
   The U.S. official gave no indication the United States was
reconsidering its decision to hold talks with the PLO. The decision
was taken last month after Arafat made a statement renouncing
terrorism in all forms and recognizing Israel's right to exist.
   At the time, Richard W. Murphy, the assistant secretary of state
for the Near East, said the ``substantive dialogue'' would be broken
off if Arafat reneged on his pledge.
   After Arafat's reported threat, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, who had recommended the U.S. talks with the PLO, said ``we
will observe behavior as the process proceeds.''
   ``Threats against people who try to move in a calmer and more
peaceful direction are acts of intimidation and fall much more into
the terrorism category,'' Shultz said.
   At the same time, Redman criticized a reported decision by
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin to take tougher measures
against Palestinians who attacked soldiers on the West Bank and in
Gaza.
   He called the reports ``very disturbing, if true.''
   On other subjects, the State Department deplored the
proliferation of biological weapons capability and issued a new
report slamming Libya as a sponsor of terrorism.
   Citing intelligence sources, Redman said a number of nations were
bent on developing this ``particularly horrible form of warfare.''
   William H. Webster, the director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, said in a speech last October that at least 10 countries
were working to produce biological weapons.
   It was understood Iraq was one of the countries identified by
U.S. intelligence sources as having a biological weapons program.
However, a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Wednesday ``it is not 100 percent certain yet.''
   Redman said he could not identify ``individual cases'' for
security reasons.
   Meanwhile, the department's office to counter terrorism reported
that Libya continued to support terrorism in 1988 despite a public
posture of moderation.
   The report, ``Libya Unchanged,'' said Libya also had participated
directly in at least one operation in Senegal and that Libyan
operatives were active worldwide, especially in Africa, Latin
America and the Caribbean.
   The Abu Nidal Organization, a Palestinian group with its
headquarters in Libya, has resumed terrorist operations with
``deadly consequences'' and several other groups supported by Libya
conducted terrorist operations against U.S. and Western targets, the
report said.
   The United States bombed Tripoli in April 1986 after linking
Libya to the bombing of a night club in West Germany frequented by
American servicemen. Subsequently, the Reagan administration said
the attack had the effect of dampening Col. Moammar Gadhafi's use of
terrorism.
   The new report said the Libyan leader ``has eventually resumed
his violent ways'' and that Libya was ``squarely in the ranks of
state sponsors of terrorism.''

<HEAD>Burmese Troops Capture Rebel Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burmese government troops backed by mortars
captured a major rebel camp near the Thai-Burmese frontier, sending
600 civilians of the Karen ethnic group fleeing to Thailand, Thai
officials said today.
   About 900 soldiers of the Burmese army seized the Klerday camp
Wednesday night following a series of attacks on peripheral Karen
outposts, officials said. Klerday is in Burma, opposite the Thai
district of Tha Song Yang in Tak.
   The officials said hundreds of armed Karens fled to areas
southeast of the fallen camp, where the guerrillas hoped to regroup.
   At Klerday, Burmese ground troops fired mortar shells and set
ablaze 80 thatched homes, according to rebels' accounts.
   From the Thai side, smoke was seen for miles some 10 hours after
the incident, a Thai journalist at the border reported.
   Earlier Wednesday, government troops overran two small bases,
forcing a number of the Karen rebels to retreat to Klerday. The
Karen National Union fields 4,000 guerrillas and is regarded as the
strongest of a dozen ethnic rebel organizations fighting the Rangoon
government for greater autonomy.
   A Karen fighter later told The Associated Press that 700
reinforcement units arrived too late at Klerday. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Mong Chi, 40, a Karen civilian who crossed into Thailand, said:
``These attacks by the Burmese troops were the heaviest in years.''
   ``A thousand mortar shells crashed inside and around the camp,
forcing evacuations everywhere,'' he said. ``(There was) no refuge
even in bunkers.''
   Theng Tun, 27, said Burmese troops overran the camp and then
withdrew because they feared retaliation when darkness fell.
   Thai Border Patrol Police who tried to prevent the 600 Karens
from entering Thailand said they saw five Karen teen-agers with M-16
automatic rifles try to cross rapids in the Moei River. All five
were feared drowned, they said.
   Thai authorities are allowing the refugees to remain on the Thai
side of the Moei River, which forms the boundary, but will not let
them move deeper into Thailand. Tak is 230 miles northwest of
Bangkok.
   Recently, the Burmese army has stepped up its attacks on the
Karens, retaking the vital border village of Mae Tha Waw and
disrupting the rebels' main revenue source _ a lucrative smuggling
trade between Burma and Thailand.

   The engine and tile problems of the
last space shuttle mission have been resolved and the Discovery
probably will be launched into orbit on Feb. 23, said the director
of the Kennedy Space Center.
   ``We feel we have a good understanding of those problems and can
move ahead,'' Forrest S. McCartney told reporters Wednesday.
   Atlantis returned from orbit last month with severe damage to
about 200 of 28,000 tiles that protect it from re-entry heat. And
during post-flight inspection, two small cracks were found in a
bearing unit in a high-pressure engine turbopump.
   The tile damage resulted when insulation hit the shuttle during
liftoff after stripping away from both the external fuel tank and
the nose cone of one of the solid fuel booster rockets, McCartney
said.
   The fuel tank was the oldest one ever flown on a shuttle, it had
gone through some earlier test fueling cycles and some of its
insulation had been repaired before flight, he said.
   ``We feel we don't have those problems with the next tank because
we have better bonding which we have subjected to pull tests,''
McCartney said.
   The nose cone insulation has been strengthened, he said.
   Engineers believe the bearing cracks were caused by stress
corrosion, apparently resulting from moisture that somehow got into
the metal, McCartney said.
   He said the problem appears to be unique to Atlantis' turbopump
and that inspection of Discovery's turbopumps have cleared them for
flight.
   Discovery is set to make the third shuttle flight since the
explosion of Challenger three years ago. During five days in orbit,
the five-man astronaut crew is to deploy a communications satellite,
conduct experiments and photograph damage that man and nature have
caused to the Earth.

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with more on reforms favored by Markovic
and price increases announced today. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ante Markovic, former head of Croatia
and an ardent supporter of radical market-oriented reforms, was
nominated today as Yugoslavia's new premier, the state Tanjug news
agency reported.
   The nomination by the nine-member federal presidency must be
formally approved by the country's parliament at an upcoming session.
   Markovic, 64, will succeed Branko Mikulic who, together with his
entire Cabinet, resigned Dec. 30. It was the first time since the
ruling communists took power after World War II that a federal
government had stepped down.
   Mikulic's government had failed to solve the country's myriad
social and economic ills, including a 250 percent annual inflation
rate and a $21 billion foreign debt. Even as Markovic was nominated
today, prices increases were announced on more than 300 goods and
services.
   Markovic, an electrical engineer successfully managed two of
Yugoslavia's largest engineering firms, has often advocated radical
market-oriented changes in the economy and demanded simultaneous
reforms in its political system, including a ``pluralism of ideas''
within the existing political structure.
   A record nearly 1,400 strikes were officially registered last
year amid public calls for the introduction of a multiparty system
as a solution to the protracted Yugoslav crisis.
   The Yugoslav presidency decided in favor of Markovic rather than
Borisav Jovic, a Serb, who was the only other official candidate for
the post.
   The decision is seen as an affront to Serbia's hardline Communist
Party president Slobodan Milosevic. Jovic, speaker of Serbia's
parliament, is a close political ally of Milosevic.
   Serbia has claimed the post should go to its candidate since the
largest of Yugoslavia's six republics has not had a premier in 22
years.
   The presidency's nomination of Markovic also means reformist
elements in the Communist Party have won a clear victory over more
conservative and dogmatic factions.
   The brief Tanjug dispatch did not indicate how the vote in the
nine-member presidency was conducted, or thge margin of Markovic's
victory. Before his nomination, Markovic enjoyed the support of
Yugoslavia's liberal and developed northern republics of Slovenia
and Croatia.
   Jovic was supported by the poorer and more conservative southern
regions that fear radical market-oriented reforms could result in
the closure of state-subsidized factories, massive layoffs and
further social unrest.
   In Yugoslavia, the federal government is generally responsible
for economic policy while the collective presidency, which appoints
the premier, dictates defense and foreign policy.
   But the bulk of political influence in the country is
concentrated in the Communist Pparty, with power dispersed in eight
often fractious central committees, reflecting the administrative
division of the country into six republics and two autonomous
provinces.
   The government essentially follows guidelines set by the party
bodies that must themselves hammer out a consensus before any
policies can be implemented.
   The government announced price increases today for 300 goods and
services, including a 30 percent boost in the price of gasoline and
diesel fuel.
   The national petroleum company attributed the increase to a 36.62
percent depreciation of the dinar against the U.S. dollar since the
last fuel price increase on Nov. 12, which makes foreign oil
purchases more expensive.
   Yugoslav workers earn the equivalent of about $80 a month.

   Foreign Minister Isidoro Malmierca of Cuba arrived
in Beijing tonight for the first visit of a Cuban foreign minister
to China.
   Earlier today, the Xinhua News Agency reported that China's
foreign minister, Qian Qichen, has accepted an invitation to travel
to Cuba.
   Qian was quoted by Xinhua as saying Malmierca's visit to Beijing
would contribute significantly to Chinese-Cuban ties.
   Malmierca arrived a day later than scheduled. It was not clear
why the visit had been delayed.
   In an interview in Bucharest, Romania, Qian said Malmierca
invited him to Cuba and that he had accepted. It would be his first
visit to Latin America. No dates have been set.
   China and Cuba established diplomatic relations in 1960 but
relations with Cuba and the rest of the Soviet bloc remained chilly
for two decades due to China's split with the Soviet Union.
   When Beijing and Moscow began to improve ties in the early 1980s,
China and Cuba started cultural and other non-political exchanges. A
trade agreement was signed in 1985.
   Two-way trade jumped from $179 million in 1986 to $300 million in
1988, Xinhua reported. Prospects for further development are
limited, however, because the economies of China and Cuba are too
similar. Both export large quantities of raw materials and are
interested in importing high technology.
   Still, a ministerial level meeting on trade and commerce was held
recently in Beijing bectween Cuba and China. Qian said that meeting
marked a new beginning for economic cooperation.

   People infected with the AIDS virus should
correct bad dietary habits even before AIDS symptoms appear, a
nutrition task force says.
   Early corrective steps ``may slow weiht loss and avoid
nutritional complications'' seen in full-blown AIDS, the guidelines
say.
   Diet alone cannot cure AIDS, and scientists do not yet know
whether proper nutrition truly affects the course of the disease,
cautioned Myron Winick, chairman of the task force that produced the
guidelines.
   But experience with other conditions suggests it may help, said
Winick, professor of nutrition and pediatrics at the Columbia
University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York.
   ``We hope that the course of this disease can be a little better
and that the quality of life can be improved if we pay attention to
nutrition, and we start paying attention right from the beginning,''
he said in a recent interview.
   The 11-member task force included representatives from the
National Institutes of Health, universities and hospitals. Its
guidelines on nutrition and AIDS were intended for health care
personnel.
   Infected but symptom-free people should be assessed for
nutritional deficiencies and counseled about the value of proper
diet in AIDS, the guidelines say. The person's nutritional reserves
can then be built up before they contend with the disease, Winick
said.
   People with AIDS may have mouth pain, difficulty swallowing,
diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite and other symptoms that interfere
with proper nutrition, but they can take steps to ease the problems,
the task force said.
   For example, avoiding foods that are spicy, acidic or very hot or
cold may help in avoiding mouth pain, the task force said. Foods
with a single texture are easier to swallow than others, while
eating with a friend in a pleasant atmosphere may encourage a
flagging appetite.
   The task force was financed with a grant from Norwich Eaton
Pharmaceuticals Inc., which makes a nutrition formula that can be
used in AIDS patients with bowel troubles, Winick said.

   In a bid to protect the native language, the tiny
republic of Estonia has decreed that all Russians and other
non-natives who work in stores, government or other service jobs
learn Estonian in four years.
   The restive Baltic republic's legislature voted on Wednesday by
204-50, with six abstentions, to adopt the unprecedented law, said
Felix Undusk, a commentator for state-run Estonian television.
People who fail to comply will lose their jobs, he said.
   It was another pioneering move by Estonia's legislature, which in
November challenged the central government in Moscow by declaring
sovereignty over all but foreign affairs.
   There was no immediate reaction from the Kremlin to Estonia's
latest action. Official Soviet media reported on the new law, but
did not mention the sanctions against workers who do not learn
Estonian.
   Radio Moscow said the republic's Supreme Soviet adopted a law
making Estonian the official language but that the law ``points out
that such a status does not infringe on the rights of people whose
mother tongue is not Estonian.''
   Estonia's standard of living, enviably high by Soviet standards,
has led to an influx of immigrants, and many Estonians fear they
will one day be outnumbered in their own homeland.
   About 65 percent of Estonia's population of 1.5 million is ethnic
Estonian. Russians make up 28 percent, Ukrainians 3 percent and
Byelorussians 2 percent.
   ``This law means that if I go to the doctor, or ask a policeman
where the post office is, I can get an answer in Estonian,'' Undusk
said in a telephone interview from Tallinn, the Estonian capital.
``For Estonians, this is important. This is the only place in the
world where our language is spoken.''
   Undusk said there had been ``a great deal of immigration in past
years, and there are people who work in post offices, medical
clinics and factories who don't speak Estonian and have never
tried.''
   ``This law will change that by requiring them to learn the
language. If they don't after four years, they will have to leave
their jobs.''
   He said another provision of the law requires all goods sold in
the republic to be labeled in Estonian.
   Tass, the official news agency, said the law also requires that
legal proceedings and records at Estonian offices and factories be
in Estonian.
   Russian traditionally has been the common language among the more
than 100 nationalities of the empire the Bolsheviks captured from
the czars.
   Many citizens of Estonia, an independent nation forcibly absorbed
by the Soviet Union in 1940 with its neighbors Latvia and Lithuania,
refuse to learn Russian or use it only when necessary.
   Undusk, who attended Wednesday's legislative session, said the
republic would finance Estonian-language courses and print
instruction manuals for ethnic Russians or others who must learn the
language.
   Most government documents in Estonia were written in Russian
until 1987 and the republic's former Communist Party chief knew
little Estonian. He was replaced last summer by a reformer and a
native of the republic, Vaino Vyalyas.
   A constitutional amendment passed last month made Estonian the
official language, but legislators postponed a vote on requiring
foreigners to learn it.
   When Estonia declared sovereignty in November, the Presidium of
the Supreme Soviet in Moscow _ the nation's top executive body _
declared the action illegal. But Estonian lawmakers say their own
constitution outranks Presidium decrees.

   A man who said he wanted to ``symbolically
assassinate'' George Bush has been convicted of two misdemeanor
counts for bringing a starter pistol to a campaign rally for the
president-elect.
   John Arthur Junot, 40, an anti-nuclear activist who wrote a
sympathetic poem about John Hinckley Jr., faces up to 18 months in
prison and up to $105,000 in fines at his sentencing, scheduled
March 6 before U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian.
   After a non-jury trial, Junot was convicted Wednesday of
interfering with a Secret Service agent engaged in a protective
function and disorderly conduct in an area protected by the Secret
Service.
   ``He wanted to fire the pistol at the vice president and
broadcast his view that any candidate was vulnerable and that if
Bush was killed, (Indiana Sen. Dan) Quayle would be president,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Schiff said.
   Junot told a prison psychologist that he brought the starter gun
to the Nov. 6 rally in the San Fernando Valley suburb of Woodland
Hills to ``symbolically assassinate Bush,'' according to court
records.
   Junot fumbled while trying to hold the gun and dropped the weapon
before firing it.
   The daylong trial before the judge involved 14 witnesses,
including Secret Service agents, police, bystanders at the rally and
the psychotherapist, Jeanne G. Hetzel. Junot, who didn't testify,
waived his right to a jury trial.
   An agent who searched Junot's apartment found the poem that said
he understood Hinckley, who attempted to assassinate President
Reagan in March 1981 to impress actress Jodie Foster.
   ``The first line of the poem is, `If it takes a blood bath, let's
get it over with,''' Schiff said.

   A new kind of surgery can correct a
common heart rhythm abnormality that is the underlying cause of
225,000 disabling strokes in the United States each year, its
developer said.
   The experimental procedure cures a disorder known as atrial
fibrillation, which affects an estimated 1.5 million to 2 million
Americans.
   Although the strokes that result from this problem can sometimes
be prevented with blood-thinning drugs, that treatment is often
ineffective and may itself cause unwanted bleeding.
   The new technique was developed by Dr. James L. Cox of Washington
University School of Medicine, who described it Wednesday at a
meeting of the American Heart Association. Slices are made in the
atria, the two upper pumping chambers of the heart.
   Cox has performed the operation so far on three people, and all
of them have been completely free of the disorder since their
surgery. However, more work will be necessary before doctors can
estimate how widely the operation will be used.
   ``I think we have a definitive treatment for people with atrial
fibrillation,'' said Cox.
   ``It's a remarkable step forward,'' commented Dr. Myron L.
Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University, who is president-elect of the
association.
   The surgery corrects chaotic beating _ fibrillation _ of the
atria. During fibrillation, the chambers stop orderly beating, and
this disrupts the flow of blood through the heart.
   As a result, blood tends to form clots inside the left atrium,
and these sometimes break off and flow into the brain. There, they
can plug arteries and shut off the flow of blood, causing strokes.
   To combat the problem, doctors often give anticoagulants, which
slow the body's natural tendency to form blood clots.
   However, Dr. Louis R. Caplan of New England Medical Center in
Boston said that doctors suspect this treatment may do more harm
than good.
   ``It's a huge problem,'' said Caplan, a stroke expert. ``The
question is which, if any, patient should have anticoagulants and
which, if any, should have this procedure.''
   During the 45-minute surgery, doctors make four slices in the
atria. This keeps the electrical signal that regulates the heart
beat flowing across the heart muscle in just one direction so it
doesn't become chaotic.
   ``This operation proves that you can deal with the problem of
chaotic traffic (inside the heart) by creating one-way streets,''
said Weisfeldt.
   Cox said it is still unclear how many of the 225,000 potential
annual victims of strokes resulting from atrial fibrillation might
be treated with the new operation. He said it is most likely to be
used in patients who are already undergoing heart surgery for other
problems.
   He said he has been cautious in expanding the operation, which
was first developed experimentally in dogs. But he said there is a
waiting list of 14 patients who want to receive it at his hospital.
   Cox said one goal will be to find ways to reduce the time it
takes to perform the operation, perhaps by using using lasers
instead of ordinary surgical knives.

   A car thief calling himself Sid cheerfully chatted
with a woman on the car's phone while making off with her
brother-in-law's Bonneville.
   ``That's not your car,'' Leslee Flynn said she told the man, who
said he was taking the car for a joy ride Tuesday night.
   Michael Godvin had parked the car downtown Tuesday night to
attend a Detroit Red Wings hockey game, Flynn said.

   Flynn said the thief promised her he would return the car to

   But police recovered the car Wednesday on the other side of town.
The auto's radar detector, stereo, phone, tires and baby seat were
missing, Brigid Godvin said.
   ``I thought it took a lot of nerve,'' she said.
   Her sister-in-law added, ``And he lied about returning the car.''

   The body of Emperor Hirohito was moved from his
residence today to a makeshift mortuary where it will remain until
his funeral next month.
   An eight-car motorcade carrying the coffin, newly ascended
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, the head of the Imperial
Household Agency and several imperial chamberlains wound slowly
through the wooded palace grounds.
   The coffin will remain in a specially converted room at the main
Imperial Palace until Hirohito's funeral Feb. 24, which is expected
to be attended by representatives of more than 100 countries.
   About 800 employees of the agency and palace police force lined
part of the route and bowed or saluted as the black hearse passed,
its windows draped in white cloth. Many of them wore black armbands
in mourning for Hirohito, who died Jan. 7 of cancer at age 87.
   Hirohito's wife, Empress Dowager Nagako, who has been suffering
from a hip injury and is confined to a wheelchair, did not attend
the rite.
   The coffin was placed in the main palace's Pine Room, whose walls
and floor were covered in white cloth. A white tent was set up with
a separate inner sanctuary to hold the coffin, which had a Japanese
screen and protective sword at its head and was surrounded by
lanterns and chrysanthemum displays.
   Akihito and other members of the imperial family made offerings
of some of the late emperor's favorite foods as musicians played
court music, the household agency said.
   Hourly offerings of rice, salt and water are to be made for three
days starting Friday, the agency said.

   An offshore quake jolted Southern California,
shattering windows in ritzy Malibu, briefly knocking out power to
100,000 customers and reverberating with dozens of aftershocks today.
   No major damage was reported from Wednesday's temblor, which
measured 5.0 on the Richter scale and was centered 30 miles
southwest of downtown Los Angeles in Santa Monica Bay. The quake
swayed downtown skyscrapers.
   ``It's the strongest earthquake I've felt in 14 years of living
in Los Angeles,'' said Rick Cziment of Los Angeles. ``It actually
scared me. Our house went dark. My daughter woke up and began
crying.''
   Firefighters in Manhattan Beach attributed one injury to the
10:54 p.m. quake when a woman fell on her nose. No other injuries
were reported.
   ``At this point, it looks like we got off pretty well,'' said
Michael Gurein, spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Services.
   Rubble from about a dozen rock slides blew out tires on at least
four vehicles traveling the narrow, twisting Malibu Canyon Road that
leads to the swank Malibu beach colony, 30 miles southwest of Los
Angeles, said sheriff's Sgt. Bill Hutton. The road remained open.
   The quake could be felt from Seal Beach to Santa Barbara, a
distance of 140 miles.
   Windows along the coast shattered, including a department store
plate glass window in Malibu.
   But most of the damage was to the nerves of humans and animals
alike. Cory Ford of Whittier said the quake rattled her cat.
   ``Moments before the quake, our cat, Jasmine, started running
around in circles, her tail stood straight up, her fur out like
electricity,'' said Ford. ``Then came a sudden hard jolt for a few
seconds, then a rolling shake, all for about 8 or 10 seconds, though
it seemed longer.''
   Dozens of tiny aftershocks continued to vibrate throughout the
area today, most of them too small to measure, said Lucile Jones,
seismologist at the California Institute of Technology.
   The quake briefly knocked out power to nearly 100,000 dwellings
and businesses across Los Angeles, the city's Department of Water
and Power reported.
   Wednesday's quake struck with the same magnitude of a Dec. 3
temblor that was centered beneath downtown Pasadena. That quake
briefly knocked out power to 100,000 homes and caused more than two
dozen minor injuries.
   The Whittier Narrows quake of Oct. 1, 1987, measured 5.9 on the
Richter scale. That quake and its 5.3-magnitude aftershock on Oct. 4
killed eight people, injured more than 200 others and caused $358
million in damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage.

   An outbreak of Lyme disease that struck one-third
of the people who lived near a Massachusetts wildlife preserve could
happen anyplace in the northern United States where deer are
plentiful, researchers say.
   In a study released today, doctors found that the disease spread
explosively near the preserve in Ipswich, Mass., after the deer herd
became infested with bacteria-carrying ticks.
   ``This appears to be a model for what might happen in other
locations in which the abundance of deer is undergoing a rapid
increase,'' said Dr. Andrew Spielman of the Harvard School of Public
Health.
   Lyme disease is a potentially serious illness that can cause a
variety of seemingly unrelated symptoms, including a rash,
headaches, facial paralysis, heart complications and arthritis.
However, it can be cured if treated early with penicillin.
   About 1,500 cases were reported last year to the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control, but officials estimate that the true total is
probably five times that. The disease is spread by ticks that feed
on the blood of white-tailed deer and field mice, but also will bite
humans.
   In the new study, doctors recorded the spread of the disease
among 190 people who lived along one road that connected the town of
Ipswich with the Crane Memorial Reservation and Wildlife Refuge. The
1,400-acre ocean-side nature preserve was already a haven for deer
before the outbreak began in about 1980.
   ``There were a lot of deer there, and once the ticks had arrived,
the transmission was really explosive,'' said Dr. Catherine C.
Lastavica. ``It was very intense in a short period of time.''
   The epidemic peaked in 1984 and 1985, athough people there
continue to catch Lyme disease. Experts believe that insecticides,
limited deer hunting in the reserve and increased awareness of ticks
have helped diminish the disease.
   Altogether, 35 percent of the area's residents got the disease
between 1980 and the end of 1987. Among those living closest to the
wildlife preserve, the attack rate was 66 percent, the researchers
found.
   The study, conducted principally by Lastavica of Tufts University
School of Medicine, was published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The researchers said that until now, the most intense reported
outbreak was on Great Island off West Yarmouth on Cape Cod between
1979 and 1983. There, 16 percent of 162 summer residents got the
disease.
   Spielman said the disease has the potential to be widespread
anyplace north of the Mason-Dixon line that has deer. In the South,
he said, the disease probably will remain uncommon, perhaps because
ticks there feed on lizards, which are poor reservoirs for the bugs.
   Lyme disease has been seen in 34 states, but is most common in
New England, the mid-Atlantic states, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and
California.
   The disease was first recognized by Dr. Allen Steere, now of New
England Medical Center, in Old Lyme, Conn. Steere published a report
on Lyme disease in 1976 and gave the illness its name.

   An Israeli soldier shot a Palestinian teen-ager
to death today as the youth urged on stone-throwers at a refugee
camp in the occupied Gaza Strip, the army and Arab reports said.
   Twenty-one Palestinians were reported wounded in scattered
clashes with Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip and occupied West
Bank, including 10 who were shot after attacking the home of an
alleged Palestinian collaborator.
   The violence came as West Bank residents staged a general strike
to protest an upsurge in Palestinian deaths. Fourteen Arab youths
have been killed in clashes with the army in the past week.
   The strike order came two days after the army instituted a
tougher policy that allows soldiers to fire plastic and rubber
bullets more freely and provides for harsher punishment for
stone-throwers.
   The military government also closed 84 of the West Bank's 1,200
schools today in an effort to block violent protests. The schools
were shut down for periods of three days to four weeks.
   In the Gaza Strip's Shati refugee camp, a soldier shot
18-year-old Mohammed Dahaise ``after he was identified as an
inciter'' of a stone-throwing attack on troops, said an army
spokeswoman.
   She said Dahaise, who was from nearby Gaza City, was killed
instantly. Arab hospital officials said he was shot in the head.
   His death brought to 363 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
began in December 1987. Fifteen Israelis also have died.
   In the West Bank village of Arraba, residents stoned the home of
a man suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities, Arab
witnesses said. The man emerged from his home with a pistol and shot
four of the stone-throwers, the witnesses said.
   Palestinians in the occupied lands are barred from bearing
firearms, but those cooperating with the authorities often are
issued weapons for self-protection.
   After the stoning attack, Israeli troops arrived and opened fire,
wounding six villagers, including a 10-year-old boy who was in
critical condition with a bullet in the head, hospital officials
said.
   The army spokeswoman confirmed the account, but said without
elaborating that ``several'' villagers were wounded.
   The strike in the West Bank, accompanying one already under way
in the Gaza Strip, was called Wednesday by the PLO-backed Unified
Leadership of the Uprising. But word of the strike spread slowly and
it was not fully observed until today.
   Israeli reports said leaflets calling for the shutdown were
circulated, but Palestinians in the West Bank said they saw none and
only heard of the strike on Arab-language radio from abroad or by
word of mouth.
   Some merchants in the West Bank town of Bethlehem opened their
shops today at 8 a.m., as usual, and only shuttered their doors
after neighbors told them about the strike.
   Hundreds of students walked to school but turned back after
hearing about the strike, Arab reporters said.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest and most militant city,
students headed for school were turned back by Palestinian youths
whose faces were covered by keffiyehs, the checked Arab scarves that
have become a symbol of the uprising.

<TEXT>
   A dozen people occupied a regional
immigration office for nearly five hours today to protest the arrest
of a Sri Lankan man who sought refuge in a church to avoid being
deported.
   Merseyside police Inspector Bill Dugdale said the protesters
entered the immigration office in this northern England port city
this morning, chained and padlocked the main door to keep out staff,
then ended their protest.
   ``They never got past the foyer, and we had been intent on doing
nothing,'' Dugdale said. ``They either got fed up or they think
they've achieved their objective. They left the premises of their
own free will.''
   The protesters caused no damage and none of them was arrested, he
said.
   On Wednesday, police smashed their way into a church vestry in
Manchester, 30 miles from Liverpool, and dragged away Sri Lnakan
activist Viraj Mendis, 32.
   Mendis, who moved into the church after being issued a deporation
order in 1986, says he fears persecution or death if returned to his
Indian Ocean homeland, which is wracked by ethnic violence between
guerrillas of the majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamil
populations.
   He was taken to a London prison to await deportation Friday. His
lawyer, David Burgess, said he would appeal the deportation in the
High Court.
   ``He was surprisingly spirited but he must be very apprehensive
about what will happen,'' Burgess told reporters after visiting
Mendis in the hospital wing of Pentonville Prison.
   The government said Mendis would be sent home unless a third
country accepted him. Home Office Minister Timothy Renton said on
Wednesday that Mendis ``had no well-founded case of persecution in
Sri Lanka.''
   Mendis, who is Sinhalese, claims his life is threatened by his
political activism in favor of communism and the Tamil minority.
   His removal from the church caused an outcry from his supporters,
who said the action violated his ancient right to sanctuary in a
church.
   Under English common law, a person accused of committing a crime
could take sanctuary in a church but had to surrender or leave the
country in 40 days. This right was abolished in 1623, but Mendis'
supporters chose the ancient right as his last resort to stay in
Britain.

   As an inquiry opened today into the
world's worst oilfield disaster, Occidental Petroleum Corp. said
sabotage was discovered on the Piper Alpha rig a year before it was
destroyed by a fire.
   Some of the victims' relatives protested at the opening day of
the hearing, demanding more searches for unrecovered bodies.
   The North Sea rig, owned by the U.S. company and a consortium of
British partners, was swept by explosions and fire on July 6 that
killed 167 men. The bodies of 31 have not been recovered.
   ``Ball bearings were found in one of the gas compressors,''
Occidental spokesman Alex Blake-Milton told Britain's Independent
Radio News in an interview today. ``Lord (Douglas) Cullen and the
Department of Energy are both aware and so it may well be raised at
the inquiry.''
   Cullen, the Scottish judge leading the inquiry, today dismissed a
union leader's claim the hearing would be restricted to narrow
technical questions. He said it would deal with ``all evidence which
has a tenable connection with what occurred.''
   The government has asked Cullen to establish the cause of the
disaster and recommend ways of preventing a similar disaster from
occurring.
   Gavin Cleland, 60, whose 33-year-old son Robert was killed,
unfurled a banner outside the inquiry center in the Scottish oil
port city of Aberdeen calling on the government to ``bring the men
up now'' who are believed entombed by 12,500 tons of debris in the
waters 120 miles off the coast.
   ``I will demonstrate until they clear the sea of Piper Alpha,''
Cleland told reporters.
   Blake-Milton said the sabotage attempt was discovered in
September 1987. The ball bearings were found and removed without
incident.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said the ball bearings were found
in the same area in which the explosions occurred in July.
   Occidental, which operated the Piper Alpha platform, said the
ball bearings were placed in a gas compression valve while it was
temporarily out of service and were found when it was brought back
into commission.
   The BBC quoted an unidentified Occidental spokesman as saying the
bearings could have caused serious damage but not necessarily an
explosion.
   The sabotage attempt had earlier been disclosed by John Wood, one
of the 62 survivors of the disaster in July.
   The Department of Energy has said the disaster was not caused by
sabotage. It said in a preliminary technical report that a buildup
of gas following a leak in the control module was thought to have
been the cause.
   Today's inquiry, attended by survivors, rescuers, technical
experts, lawyers, reporters and observers, is being held at this oil
port city in northeast Scotland and is expected to last at least six
months.
   In the disaster, the blazing production platform lit up the night
sky for 20 miles. The gas-fed fires raged on sporadically until
leaking and burning wells were brought under control 23 days later.
   The search for bodies was called off last month, and Occidental
says further searches could endanger divers. Occidental plans to
demolish the remains of the wrecked rig next month, severing the
upper half with explosives so it topples to the sea bed.
   Margo Gordon, whose husband James is among the missing, said: ``I
could understand and accept better if there were just one or two
bodies still missing. But 31 is a lot of men, too many to leave it
be and allow the families to be written off.''

   Single shots fired into two classrooms have
parents on edge, students barred from the playground and police on
patrol outside where the incident occurred the same day five
students were killed in California.
   ``A sacred trust is broken when something like this happens,''
said John R. Edwards, a state police lieutenant and Swanton School
Board member. No one was injured when single gunshots were fired
into two occupied sixth-grade classrooms Tuesday morning.
   ``Both bullets appear to be from the same weapon,'' believed to
be a rifle, Edwards said. ``We're not going to speculate as to
whether it's accidental or not, or what a motive would be if it
wasn't.''
   State police, Swanton police and the Franklin County state's
attorney's office are investigating.
   ``There is, of course, a great deal of concern in the
community,'' said Jay Sweeney, a sheriff's department lieutenant who
had a shift outside the Swanton Central School.
   ``We will maintain that (patrol) as long as we feel that it's
necessary,'' said Principal Mary Lynn Riggs, who visited classrooms
Wednesday with the school counselor.
   ``Students are being kept inside until we have more
information,'' said Riggs, who said there also was ``some general
surveillance'' at Swanton's other elementary school.
   ``The timing was bad,'' said Edwards, referring to Tuesday's
shooting at a Stockton, Calif., elementary school where a gunman
killed five students and wounded 29 others and a teacher before
committing suicide.
   A small number of parents kept their children home Wednesday,
Riggs said.

<UNK>Zsa Zsa Gabor Sues Delta For $10 Million Over Dogs Incident</UNK>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zsa Zsa Gabor has filed a lawsuit against Delta
Air Lines over a Jan. 6 incident in which she was escorted off a
flight for refusing to cage her two dogs.
   ``They started it, this is just the kickoff,'' said Ms. Gabor's
attorney, Bernard Cohen of Hollywood, Fla. ``She's not going to
retreat. She's on the offensive.''
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Palm Beach County, Fla., where
Ms. Gabor lives, seeks at least $10 million in damages from the
Atlanta-based airline.
   Ms. Gabor, 69, was escorted off a Delta jet when it landed at
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport for a scheduled stop during
a flight from Los Angeles to West Palm Beach. Delta officials said
the actress was belligerent and used offensive language when flight
attendants asked her to put her two Shih Tzu dogs, Genghis Khan and
Macho Man, back into their carriers.
   In the lawsuit, Ms. Gabor said she ``was not treated in a
first-class manner'' by the ``servants and employees'' of the
airline. She said Delta was negligent in taking her money for four
tickets _ for herself, an assistant and the dogs _ and then failing
to deliver her to her destination.
   The lawsuit also said William D. Berry, Delta's vice president
for public relations, defamed Ms. Gabor when he told reporters that
she had ``insulted the Atlanta agents with vulgarities'' and used
words that were ``less than ladylike.''
   Delta spokeswoman Jackie Pate called the lawsuit ``quite
interesting but totally unwarranted.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has purchased 13 love letters
written by poet Alexander Pushkin in a transaction that fulfilled a
lifelong dream of the late Russian-born choreographer Serge Lifar.
   The yellowed letters, in Pushkin's flowing handwriting, were
handed over Wednesday night in a brief ceremony at a Geneva hotel to
Yuri M. Khilchevsky. The deputy Soviet minister of culture described
the acquisition of the letters by Russia's greatest and most honored
poet as a ``festive event.''
   All but two of the letters are in French and addressed to Natalya
Goncharova before Pushkin married her in 1831 after a turbulent
courtship and against the will of her mother.
   Once owned by a member of the czar's family, Grand Duke Mikhail,
they were acquired by Sergei Diaghilev, the famous impresario who
died in 1929, and eventually were obtained by Lifar, the executor of
Diaghilev's will.
   The Soviet Ministry of Culture paid an undisclosed price for the
letters in a private deal negotiated through Sotheby's, the auction
house. The money will help fund the Serge Lifar Prize awarded
annually to talented dancers.
   Khilchevsky, alluding to the policy of perestroika launched by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said a ``new political
mentality'' had ``humanized relations.'' People, he said,
increasingly valued the ``pure source'' of Pushkin's works which he
termed a ``symbol of Russian culture.''
   The letters tell in dramatic prose of Pushkin's love for Natalya
who was separated from him for months because of a quarantine
imposed on Moscow residents during a major outbreak of cholera in
the summer of 1830.
   Many are pierced with a pin, apparently in the belief this would
kill the dreaded disease, experts said. One letter that was read
aloud revealed his feelings for Natalya and his fear that her mother
would prevent their marriage.
   ``Maybe she is right and I am wrong in believing that happiness
would be mine. But in any case, you are absolutely free to decide.
As for myself, I give you my word of honor that I will either belong
to you or never marry.''
   Pushkin died in 1837, at age 38, from injuries received defending
his wife's honor in a duel with his brother-in-law.
   The letters will become part of the Pushkin Museum in Leningrad,
the former St. Petersburg, where the author of ``Boris Godunov'' and
``Eugen Onegin'' settled after his marriage.
   Lifar, who left Russia as a refugee, settled in France in the
1920s where he revolutionized French ballet. He died of cancer Dec.
15, 1986, at 81 in Lausanne after moving to Switzerland in 1981 with
his companion of three decades, Countess Lillan Ahlefeldt of Sweden.
   She attended the ceremony Wednesday night and told reporters
Lifar hoped throughout his life the letters would return to the
country where he was born. She said he had many offers from other
countries, including the United States, but refused them all despite
being in dire financial straits.
   ``Instead of selling the letters, he would eat biscuits or take
the metro (subway),'' she told reporters. ``His hopes were raised by
several visitors from the Soviet Union. They kept telling him you
will hear from us. But they left him waiting till his death.
   ``He was already dying when they promised him that if the letters
would come back, they would perform his famous classical ballets,''
she said.
   ``Even on the morning of the day he died he said to me go down to
the concierge and ask if there is not a letter from Moscow. There
wasn't.''

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Says Soviets To Dismantle Some Short-Range Nuclear Missiles</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with U.S. reaction, details on weapons to be removed.
No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze said today the Soviet Union will withdraw some of its
short-range nuclear missiles from Eastern Europe.
   Shevardnadze said a security and human rights accord approved
Sunday by 35 nations attending a Vienna meeting made the move
possible. He said the missiles will be pulled out along with troops
being withdrawn from Eastern Europe.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced in December that
50,000 Red Army troops would be pulled out of Eastern Europe over
the next two years, but he made no mention of planned missile
withdrawals.
   Shevardnadze made the announcement to foreign ministers at the
conclusion today of the Conference on Security and Human Rights in
Europe.
   Stephen Ledogar, the U.S. ambassador to new arms talks scheduled
to open in Vienna in March, described Shevardnadze's speech as
``upbeat'' and in general an encouraging sign for relations between
NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   In Brussels, NATO spokesman Robin Stafford said, ``If this
signals that ... the Soviets are now beginning to realize that their
potential far exceeds legitimate requirements, we can only find such
steps encouraging.''
   But Stafford added, ``Certainly questions must be answered. Which
systems will be removed? How many? To where? And what happens to
them then? In any event, Soviet superiority seems certain to remain
for some time.''
   Saying that ``truth must be visible,'' Shevardnadze said the
Soviet Union should publish by the end of the month a detailed
schedule of its armed forces reductions.
   He said the Soviet Union has long offered to negotiate removal of
its short-range nuclear weapons and promised to withdraw them from
Europe as part of the Kremlin's ``fundamental objective of removing
any foreign military presence and bases from the territory of other
countries.''
   Short-range missiles, also known as tactical or battlefield
weapons, have a range up to 300 miles and are not covered in the
1987 arms accord signed by President Reagan and Gorbachev. That
agreement was to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear weapons, with
a range up to 1,500 miles.
   In a brief exchange with reporters after his speech, Shevardnadze
made clear that only those short-range weapons attached to military
units being withdrawn from Eastern Europe will be removed and
dismantled without conditions.
   Shevardnadze said he could not say what percentage of the
Kremlin's short-range stockpile would remain deployed. He called on
the West to negotiate removal of the remaining missiles as soon as
possible.
   Ledogar repeated the U.S. position that negotiations on the
remaining short-range missiles should be set only when some progress
has been made toward balancing the two sides' conventional forces,
such as tanks and artillery.
   ``We don't want to abandon the nuclear leg of the deterrent until
we have a much better situation on conventional forces,'' Ledogar
told The Associated Press.
   NATO believes the Warsaw Pact has a substantial edge in
conventional weapons.
   Referring to recent NATO statements that modernization of the
West's short-range nuclear missiles is possible, Shevardnadze said
the Kremlin regards those plans as ``a step backward'' in arms
control.
   Shevardnadze said the Kremlin foresees a summit meeting of the
leaders of all 35 countries participating in the Vienna meeting as
necessary.
   On Sunday, the nations approved an accord that includes agreement
on a new round of arms talks to reduce conventional weapons and
troops across Europe. Those talks are to begin in Vienna on March 9.
   The accord also put forth a sweeping definition of human rights
to be protected, including freer travel and religious practice,
environmental protection and economic cooperation.
   In his wide-ranging speech today, Shevardnadze paid tribute to
his departing American counterpart, Secretary of State George
Shultz, but he criticized comments made by Shultz and other Western
foreign ministers as ``fault-finding,'' full of accusations and
hazardous to the general spirit of trust and cooperation embodied in
the Vienna accord.
   Shevardnadze praised the accord as an achievement born of
cooperation and an indication of hope for the future.
   ``The Vienna meeting has shaken up the Iron Curtain, weakened its
rusty support, made new breaches in it and hastened its corrosion,''
Shevardnadze said.
   Also today, Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti announced
that Gorbachev will make an official visit to Italy in November.
   No Soviet Communist Party chief has ever visited Italy and
analysts said the visit could set the stage for a historic meeting
with Pope John Paul II. The Vatican has always said the Pope would
be open to such a meeting.

<HEAD>Command Denied Recommendation of Decoration for El Salvador Military

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Southern Command denied a
recommendation a year ago that two military advisers assigned to El
Salvador receive a decoration for their performance during a brief
firefight with guerrillas, the Pentagon said today.
   The incident, publicized Thursday by the Miami Herald, occurred
on Feb. 16, 1988, in the small town of Usulutan, where two U.S.
Marine trainers were residing next to a Salvadoran military base.
   That section of the town came under attack by leftist guerrillas
during the night and the two Marines ``simply protected themselves''
against small arms fire, said Maj. Kathy Wood, a Pentagon
spokeswoman.
   After the action, the Marines' commander recommended the two for
the Combat Action Ribbon, saying he thought they had performed well
and kept their composure under fire. The U.S. Southern Command in
Panama, however, the parent command, ``denied the recommendation
with no reason given,'' Wood said.
   The Herald described the incident as previously unpublicized.
Wood said she did not think an account of the fighting had appeared
in the press, but said Congress had been notified of the incident on
Feb. 18, 1988, as mandated by federal law.

<HEAD>Computer Programmer To Stand Trial In Wife's Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man has been ordered to stand trial
on charges he masterminded the killing of his wife at the hands of
his teen-age daughter and then urged the girl to take blame for the
murder.
   David A. Brown, 36, was scheduled to be arraigned on murder
charges Feb. 2 in Superior Court in Santa Ana in the 1985 shooting
death of Linda Brown, 23, the defendant's fourth wife.
   Brown, a computer programmer, is accused of ordering his
then-14-year-old daughter, Cinnamon Brown, to kill his wife _
Cinnamon's stepmother _ so he could collect on his wife's life
insurance policy and be free to marry his wife's live-in sister.
   Cinnamon Brown, who had spent three years in a juvenile facility
after she was convicted of murder, told investigators recently that
her father was behind the murder, authorities said.
   After a three-week preliminary hearing, Municipal Court Judge
Floyd H. Schenk ruled Wednesday there was sufficient evidence to
bind Brown over for trial. Brown was held without bail in Orange
County Jail.
   Schenk also found there was enough evidence to support a special
allegation of murder for profit, which means that Brown could face
the death penalty if convicted.
   Brown admitted he told his daughter to take the blame for his
wife's killing and showed Cinnamon how to write a suicide note and
fake her own death after the slaying, a videotaped interview shows.
   But the tape also shows that Brown told investigators after his
arrest in September that he thought talk of a plot to kill his wife
was a ``joke'' and couldn't believe the girl and his sister-in-law
were serious about the killing.

<HEAD>Italian Officials: Soviet Leader to Visit Italy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-East-West Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
visit Italy in November, but he probably won't meet with Pope John
Paul II, Italian officials said today.
   Gorbachev's plan to visit Italy was announced by Italian Foreign
Minister Giulio Andreotti after he met with his counterpart Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   The two were attending the 35-nation Helsinki review conference.
   The announcement immediately raised speculation Gorbachev might
see the Polish-born pontiff. But Vieri Traxler, the Italian envoy to
the international Helsinki review conference, told The Associated
Press he did not know of any plans for Gorbachev to see the Pope
during the visit to Italy. ``It would be surprising if Gorbachev did
(meet with the pope),'' said Traxler.
   Relations between the Vatican and the Soviet Union have been
warming in recent months. Soviet officials participated last year in
official ceremonies marking the 1,000th year of Russian Christendom.
   In previous meetings, the Vatican told Soviet officials the pope
would be open to a meeting with the Soviet leader. However, after
Gorbachev met with Vatican officials in Moscow in June, he said much
must still happen before the pope can visit the Soviet Union, which
is officially atheist.
   Soviet officials in Moscow reviewed Gorbachev's schedule and said
he could go to Italy in the second half of November, according to
Traxler.

   It is a time of tears and farewells at the
White House as the eight years of the Reagan administration near
their end.
   On Wednesday, there were wet eyes galore in the East Room as
hundreds of White House staffers turned out to say farewell to the
president and first lady Nancy Reagan.
   On Friday, just before going to the Capitol for President-elect
Bush's inauguration, the Reagans will repeat the scene in a private
meeting with the household staff at the presidential residence.
   ``These are people that have served the president and first lady
for eight years, in most cases, in the residence,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. ``They will talk personally and
privately Friday morning.''
   If it's anything like Wednesday's event in the East Room, it will
be an emotional affair.
   The get-together began with cheers and applause from the
estimated 350 to 400 aides as the president and first lady entered.
   White House Chief of Staff Kenneth Duberstein, who was a White
House lobbyist in the beginning of the Reagan years, spoke for the
staff, telling the Reagans, ``You have allowed us to be part of your
lives and you are very much a part of ours.''
   Gifts were given: riding tack for the president, an avid
horseman; a gold and enamel box for the first lady's box collection;
and even a replica of the White House for the presidential dog, Rex.
   ``He's already taken over this White House,'' said the president.
``I'm glad he's got one of his own now. And you know something? He
doesn't get kicked out of it after two terms.''
   In a more serious vein, Reagan told his aides, ``We were all
revolutionaries, and the revolution has been a success.''
   Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, said, ``We have
been proud to call you our first lady, or Nancy, or, as that taxi
driver in New York said, `a real classy broad,' but it's been
awfully nice to call you a friend.''
   When it came the first lady's turn to speak, the tears that had
been welling in her eyes were coursing down her cheeks.
   ``Elaine said I should say something, but I'll never get through
it,'' she said. ``See?''
   Then she just said, ``Thank you,'' and she and the president made
their way through the room to the Cross Hall of the White House,
shaking hands and exchanging hugs with well-wishers as they went.
   It was the second sentimental occasion for the president in one
afternoon.
   Earlier, he met with the championship Notre Dame football team,
renewing a tie with the school that began with his role as gridiron
star George Gipp in the movie, ``Knute Rockne, All-American.''
   ``My life has been full of rich and wonderful experiences,'' the
77-year-old president said. ``And standing near the top of the list
is my long and honored association with the University of Notre Dame
and its legendary hero Knute Rockne.''
   Then, paraphrasing the line from the movie that has become his
political watchword, he said:
   ``Right now, I can't help but think that somewhere, far away,
there's a fellow with a big grin and a whole lot of pride in his
school. And he might be thinking to himself that maybe you won
another one for the Gipper.''

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Jim Weaver has filed for
bankruptcy in federal court, listing debts of $254,975 and assets of
$1,710.
   Another $4,100 of assets, including personal property and a
rental deposit in a San Francisco apartment, is listed as exempt
from bankruptcy proceedings.
   In his filing, Weaver gives a Eugene address as his home. He said
he lost another home to foreclosure by the state Department of
Veterans' Affairs.
   Weaver could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Thomas
Huntsberger of Springfield, said the legal filing was under Chapter
7 of federal bankruptcy provisions. He described it as a ``straight
liquidation bankruptcy.''
   Weaver, a Democrat, served as Oregon's 4th District
representative from 1975 to 1987.
   In 1986 he began a campaign for the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen.
Bob Packwood, R-Ore., but dropped out of the race amid an ethics
investigation into his handling of $82,000 he borrowed from his
campaign fund.
   Weaver said he lost the $82,000 in unsuccessful securities
investments in an effort to make money for his campaign fund. A
House committee found that Weaver violated House rules in handling
the funds but recommended no disciplinary action, saying Weaver
never intended to avoid public disclosure of the funds.
   In Tuesday's bankruptcy filing, Weaver said he owes $6,000 in
1987 federal income taxes and $3,200 in state income taxes for 1987.
   Weaver listed his 1987 income as $23,500 and said his current
monthly net pay is $1,612.

<HEAD>Report Says Children Had Sex Club in State Psychiatric Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state mental health commissioner has
launched an investigation of all state-run child psychiatric centers
in New York in the wake of a report that children at one facility
operated a sex ring.
   The children, mostly between the ages of 5 and 12, had sex with
each other and staff members at the facility over a seven-month
period last year while administrators looked the other way,
according to a state report obtained by The Associated Press on
Wednesday.
   The report by the state Commission of Quality of Care for the
Mentally Disabled focused on the Western New York Children's
Psychiatric Center in West Seneca, near Buffalo.
   Patients there allegedly operated an informal club that required
members to engage in oral and anal sex as an initiation rite.
   ``The events at the Western New York Children's Psychiatric
Center were intolerable and would not be condoned there or elsewhere
in the system,'' said the mental health commissioner, Richard
Surles. He said he felt a sense of ``moral outrage'' reading the
report.
   Surles said his department has already investigated half of the
state's psychiatric centers and found no other such instances.
   The report blamed ``inadequate supervision'' by staff members for
encouraging the activity. Investigators said administrators
``virtually ignored'' the fact that more than half of the children
involved had past histories of sexual abuse.
   The 62-bed psychiatric center houses children aged 5 to 18, who
are either committed or enter voluntarily for a full range of
psychiatric illnesses. The club was confined primarily to a unit
where 5- to 12-year-olds were housed.
   The commission investigated 32 child abuse complaints involving
36 children that were filed between March and October 1988. The
report said 23 of the cases involved sexual activity, 15 of them
among the children and the rest between children and staff.
   The children were allegedly involved in vaginal and anal
intercourse, oral sex and fondling, the report said.
   ``Most allegations indicated that the behavior was consensual,''
the report said. ``Several, however, carried the implication that
force, intimidation or coercion was present.''
   The facility's executive director, Cecile Davis, resigned several
weeks ago, said Robert Spoor, spokesman for the mental health
department. He said there has been one other resignation among staff
at the center and ``several'' have been disciplined.
   Four of the eight allegations involving sex between staff and
children proved to be unsubstantiated, Spoor said. One staff member
has been convicted of child abuse and investigations are continuing
that involve two other employees, he added.
   According to the commission report, patients at the center once
engaged in oral sex in a van at a time when two employees were
present. Children told investigators that in some instances, their
sexual activity was made easier because staff members were sleeping
on duty or alarm devices had been turned off.
   Several staff members allegedly knew about the sex club,
alternately called by such names as the ``Toy Club'' or
``Transformer Club,'' but didn't investigate, the report said.
   ``Many of the reported incidents of sexual activity among
children at the facility appear to have occurred or persisted due to
inadequate supervision of the children by staff,'' the commission
said.
   The commission said it was tempted to blame everyone at the
hospital, but concluded that the director was ultimately responsible.
   ``Although virtually every incident was reported to the director,
both in writing and verbally, there is little evidence of active
intervention on behalf of the children involved,'' the report said.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, giving
an early boost to the incoming Bush administration, voted 19-0 today
to recommend that the full Senate confirm James A. Baker III as
secretary of state.
   The full Senate will act on the nomination later, probably next
Wednesday.
   Today's committee vote followed two days of hearings in which
Baker fielded questions on problem areas around the world and dealt
comfortably with foreign policy issues ranging from the momentous to
the obscure.
   Virtually every member of the committee praised Baker's
performance, applauded his appointment by Bush and said his
confirmation was assured.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., said he is optimistic Baker will prove
an outstanding secretary of state, combining ``diplomacy, restraint
and carefulness.''
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Ala., said the unanimous committee vote
represents a strong bipartisan approach to the new administration.
``This is a pretty good way to start,'' he said.
   ``He is very skillful, as he should be, and I'm impressed,'' said
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., expressing a view many other committee
members said they shared.
   On Wednesday, the second of two days of testimony, Baker said the
United States and the Soviet Union are near agreement on procedures
to verify compliance with two long-pending nuclear test ban treaties.
   Baker said he understands that verification problems with the
1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty are ``completely resolved.''
He said similar problems with the 1974 nuclear test ban treaty
establishing a limit of 150 kilotons on underground tests are
``close to being resolved.''
   He said both pacts will be submitted to the Senate for
ratification but offered no timetable.
   Baker also suggested that the new Bush administration may raise
quotas for refugees because of the increasing numbers of people
wanting to come to the United States from the Soviet Union and
Southeast Asia.
   ``We will have to look at the possibility of increasing numbers
and of increasing dollars'' for the refugee program, Baker said.
   Baker said he has reservations about U.S. participation in a
scheduled 1991 international human rights conference in Moscow, but
he added, ``We made a commitment and we plan to keep it'' so long as
conditions for improvements in Soviet human rights performance are
met.
   He declined to choose from a trio of scenarios offered to explain
why Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is making radical changes
in domestic, foreign and defense policy.
   ``The jury is still out,'' Baker said. ``That's why ... we should
approach our relationship with prudence and a certain degree of
realism.''
   As he left the hearing room, Baker expressed thanks to senators
for scheduling the ``early start'' confirmation hearings even before
President-elect Bush takes office.
   ``It will mean I will be able to hit the ground with a running
start, instead of just hitting the ground,'' Baker said.

<HEAD>Pizza Delivery Man Makes Surprising Discovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pizza deliveryman found more than a
hungry customer at one apartment _ his own stolen telephone and
stereo equipment.
   ``It was just blind luck, really,'' David Copeland, 21, said
after he got most of his property back this week.
   On one of his deliveries last week, the customers demanded a
discount because, they said, the pizza was late.
   Copeland said he had to check with his boss, and when the
customers showed him to a telephone in the bedroom he recognized the
phone as his own.
   ``I could see where my programmed numbers had been erased on
it,'' he said. ``Then I turned around and saw all my equipment
sitting there on the floor, in the same order as it was in my stereo
case.''
   The Florida State University junior decided to get out of the
apartment as fast as he could.
   ``It was tough to do, but I figured that if I let on to them that
would be really stupid. I gave them a $5 discount and left.''
   He called police, who arranged to go back with him the next night.
   ``It was really hard to keep from getting all my friends and
going back over there and getting my stuff back,'' Copeland said.
   The apartment's resident, Charles Barnes, 22, told police he
bought the equipment from a man who said he was a student who needed
money for Christmas, Copeland said.
   The theft remains under investigation.
   Copeland got a bonus: his stero receiver had been broken when it
was stolen, but when he got it back it had been fixed.

   Oregon's director of prisons was found stabbed
to death outside his office at the state psychiatric hospital, and a
friend said the victim had received death threats.
   Corrections Department Director Michael Francke, who was found
early Wednesday, died of a stab wound to the heart, state Medical
Examiner Larry Lewman said.
   ``There are other injuries, the details of which will not be
released at the request of the district attorney's office,'' a
statement from Lewman's office said.
   ``Our facts right now are _ we just don't have any,'' said Lt.
Col. R.B. Madsen, deputy superintendent of the Oregon State Police.
``We've got a lot of interviews to do. We don't have a suspect at
this time.''
   Marion County District Attorney Dale Penn said a number of leads
were being pursued and that two possible motives were robbery or
revenge connected to Francke's work in Oregon or New Mexico.
   Francke, 42, was killed sometime late Tuesday, Penn said.
   Francke had received death threats, said a friend, former state
Rep. Chuck Sides, who remembered an unsigned letter Francke showed
him last fall. Sides said he could remember no details of that
letter but said Francke shrugged it off with a joke about which
legislator might have sent it.
   ``Michael was getting death threats on a regular basis,'' Sides
said. ``It was part of the job, almost.''
   Sides said Francke kept a .38-caliber revolver in his car's glove
compartment, ``but other than that, I never saw him take that many
precautions, look around the corner. He just charged ahead.''
   ``This is a sad day for Oregon,'' Gov. Neil Goldschmidt said as
he ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. ``Michael Francke
dedicated his life to making Oregon a safer place to live.''
   Since taking the Oregon post, Francke had been grappling with a
heavily overcrowded prison system that led to many felons serving
little time behind bars. The inmate population, in a system designed
for 2,800 inmates, recently hit 5,000.
   Goldschmidt named Francke, former director of the New Mexico
Corrections Department, to the Oregon post in May 1987.
   Before coming to Oregon, Francke served as a state district judge
in New Mexico from 1980 until he was named that state's corrections
chief in 1983. He also served as an assistant and deputy attorney
general in New Mexico from 1975 to 1980.
   ``All New Mexicans are indebted to Michael Francke and mourn his
tragic death,'' said Toney Anaya, who was governor when Francke was
named to head the New Mexico corrections system three years after 33
people died in a bloody prison riot there.
   Francke directed New Mexico's efforts to comply with a federal
court decree that forced a reduction in the state's prison
population.
   Goldschmidt said Dick Peterson, the department's director of
institutional operations, would serve as interim department director
until a permanent replacement for Francke could be found.

   Condemned killer Theodore Bundy once
complained that he felt like a ``caged animal'' in jail and said he
didn't want to hear about the widespread calls for his execution.
   Bundy reveals himself as variously impatient, sarcastic,
emotional and analytical in a series of tape recordings subpoenaed
by Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth in his attempts to prove
Bundy sane and ready for the electric chair.
   Bundy is scheduled for execution Tuesday in the 1978 death of
12-year-old Kimberly Leach. He also is under Florida death sentences
for the murders of two college students and has been suspected in as
many as 36 killings or disappearances of women, mostly in the
Northwest.
   In one excerpt from the self-recorded tapes, published today in
the St. Petersburg Times, Bundy reflected on public sentiment for
his death on the morning after his conviction in Miss Leach's
killing.
   ``The news is on,'' he said. ``They said the father of Kimberly
Leach wanted Bundy to have the electric chair. He didn't say whether
he wanted me to have a Lazy Boy or some other sort of vibrating
chair. ...
   ``I do take it personally when I hear it broadcast that people
want me killed. I know there are a lot of people with that opinion.
I'd just as soon not hear it, thank you.''
   In an earlier segment, Bundy expressed anxiety while awaiting a
verdict in the case.
   ``I am pacing this cell in the classic manner of a caged
animal,'' he said, his footsteps echoing across the floor. ``I hate
this waiting. ... It's like knowing that you are going to be struck
by lightning, but not knowing whether you are going to be struck in
five seconds or five hours.''
   After he was sentenced to death, Bundy recorded another segment.
``I wouldn't really say I am despondent,'' he said. ``But clearly I
am extraordinarily disappointed.''
   Bundy made the tapes for two authors writing a book about him.

<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand of France
met today with a group of Bulgarian human rights activists who asked
for Western support in the face of persecution by communist
authorities.
   The group of 12 intellectuals were invited to have breakfast with
Mitterrand at the French ambassador's residence in the Bulgarian
capital.
   The 12 included prominent Bulgarian scientists, writers, artists
and journalists. Most were members of the Club for the Support of
Glasnost amd Perestroika, which was formed in November 1988 and now
has about 150 members.
   One member of the group, 65-year-old Alexei Cherlutko, an
academic, delivered a letter to Mitterrand that said police have
harassed the group.
   Mitterrand made a strong call for more human rights when he spoke
Wednesday evening at a state banquet presided over by President
Todor Zhivkov.
   ``National sovereignty, representative democracy, separation of
powers, freedom and respect for individuals: These values have lost
nothing of their actuality,'' Mitterrand said.
   Members of the group he met with today and French officials said
several human rights activists from Plovdiv, Bulgaria's
second-largest city, were prevented by communist authorities from
traveling to Sofia.
   Authorities detained about two dozen activists in Plovdiv last
week. They were released after French diplomatic intervention but
were placed under house arrest, French officials said.
   Zhivkov, in an interview published in the French daily Le Monde
on Wednesday, said 25 people were arrested. He described them as
common criminals.
   Describing today's session with Mitterrand, science professor
Nikolai Vassiliev told reporters, ``I am delighted with the meeting.
We discussed the problems in our social development.''
   ``We want our society to become more humanized and to find its
place in the European house, mentioned by (Soviet President Mikhail
S.) Gorbachev.''

<TEXT>
   A cloud of chemical vapor poured from a
shuttered plant this morning, forcing the residents of a 19-block
area to be confined to their homes for more than an hour,
authorities said.
   No injuries were reported, said state police Sgt. A.G. Angus.
About 2,500 of the 8,000 residents in the town were affected.
   Thionyl chloride, which leaked from a ruptured drum, is an
irritant, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
spokesmen. The EPA has had control of the shut-down Artel plant
since June and evacuated downtown residents last fall to destroy a
chemical drum there.
   The federal Department of Transportation's emergency handbook
says thionyl chlordie can be poisonous if inhaled or swallowed.
   Used in the manufacture of pesticides, thionyl chloride can cause
``severe burns to skin or eyes,'' said state police spokesman Ric
Robinson.
   Reporters and photographers in Nitro said they became teary-eyed
after driving through the cloud.
   EPA officials earlier this summer called the plant ``a potential
emergency'' because of the thousands of drums of unidentified _ and
possibly hazardous _ chemicals stored there.
   Harold Yates, an EPA spokesman in Philadelphia, Pa., said the
leaking gas was in a 55-gallon drum.
   ``I could see the cloud earlier,'' said Don Mellert, who lives
about 800 yards from the Artel Chemical plant and was among
residents asked to stay inside. ``It looked like real thick smoke.''

   A 13-month-old girl who authorities say
was bludgeoned by her father with an empty champagne bottle was in
critical condition today on life-support equipment, hospital
officials said.
   Doctors were waiting for results of tests to determine whether
Natalie Alexandra Lynch was brain-dead, said Dr. Donald Dicus, vice
president of medical affairs at Western Medical Center.
   Alexandra was found by officers early Tuesday in the arms of her
dead mother, who police say was also beaten by Joseph Peter Lynch, a
43-year-old electrical engineer and youth soccer coach.
   Lynch was being held at Orange County Jail after he admitted to
police that he killed his 35-year-old wife and critically wounded
his daughter, said police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas.
   Natalie's condition had not improved by early today, said nursing
supervisor Betty Chrisco.
   Two other daughters, Holly, 9, and Angela, 4, were found asleep
and unharmed in a bedroom of the house. The girls, who apparently
have no adult relatives in the United States, were taken to
Orangewood, the county's home for abused and neglected children.
   Lynch is a Scottish citizen and Mrs. Lynch is from Australia,
said Lt. Randi Ellridge. Police know of no previous trouble with
Lynch, who was involved in church, school and social activities.
   ``It was just one of those bolts from the blue,'' Ellridge said.
   Lynch was being held in lieu of $250,000 bail and was scheduled
for arraignment Friday on murder and attempted murder charges.

   Lawyers for a man accused of killing his
illegally adopted daughter accused his former live-in lover today of
causing the injuries because she considered the 6-year-old girl a
rival.
   ``She didn't care about the kid a bit, not one bit,'' Adrian
DiLuzio, an attorney for Joel Steinberg said in a closing statement
to the jury. He also called Hedda Nussbaum ``a poor excuse for a
woman and a mother.''
   ``Lisa Steinberg was a rival,'' DiLuzio said in state court in
Manhattan. ``Lisa got all the attention she (Nussbaum) thought she
should have been getting.''
   Steinberg, 47, is accused of beating Lisa Steinberg to death.
Lisa, whom Steinberg illegally obtained at birth, was removed
unconscious from Steinberg's apartment on Nov. 2, 1987. She died of
a brain injury three days later. Steinberg, a disbarred criminal
lawyer, is charged with second-degree murder.
   The prosecution has argued that Steinberg severely beat the girl,
then acted with reckless and depraved indifference to her life by
letting her lie unconscious on the bathroom floor for 12 hours
without seeking help.
   Defense attorney Ira London blames the girl's death on the
prosecution's chief witness, Ms. Nussbaum, 46, Steinberg's former
live-in companion of 12 years.
   London argues that Ms. Nussbaum, who testified Steinberg told her
he struck Lisa and ``she didn't want to get up,'' was jealous of the
relationship between Steinberg and Lisa, giving her a motive to
fatally injure the child.
   Ms. Nussbaum reached a deal with prosecutors in which similar
charges brought against her were dropped in exchange for her
testimony.
   During closing arguments, London planned to review and interpret
the bulk of the case for the defense while most of the medical
testimony was to be summarized and analyzed by DiLuzio.
   The prosecution presented a case that was almost entirely
circumstantial, with no eyewitnesses and no direct physical evidence
that Steinberg killed Lisa.
   Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro was to present the
prosecution's closing arguments.

   A cardiologist testified today that he was
shocked by the physical condition of former Philippines president
Ferdinand Marcos when he examined him earlier this week at a
Honolulu hospital.
   ``He was unable to complete a sentence without stopping and
gasping,'' Dr. Robert Eliot told a federal judge who will determine
if Marcos is physically fit to stand trial on charges he stole
millions of dollars from his country.
   Eliot, who went to Hawaii to give Marcos a stress test, said
Marcos was suffering from heart failure and kidney problems.
   ``To make a long story short, I felt this was a dying man,'' said
Eliot, who did consulting work on stress for NASA in the late 1960s.
The comments were made in a hearing before U.S. District Judge John
F. Keenan.
   On Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella said
prosecutors were convinced ``for the first time'' that the
71-year-old Marcos was too ill to travel here for arraignment.
However, LaBella said the prosecution hoped for a speedy arraignment
in Honolulu and would not drop charges against Marcos.
   Marcos, living in exile in Honolulu since 1986, has been
hospitalized there since Sunday with pneumonia and bronchial asthma.
   St. Francis Medical Center spokeswoman Norma Kop said Marcos was
in guarded condition today and had improved. Marcos has been
hospitalized three times in the last six weeks, twice for treatment
of congestive heart failure.
   Ms. Kop said Marcos' doctors refused to say whether he was dying.
She said she did not know when he would be released.
   The hearing, which will include testimony by several doctors, may
take several days.
   ``You're saying he can never be arraigned anywhere because he's
not competent medically to stand trial?'' Keenan asked Marcos
attorney Richard A. Hibey at a court session Wednesday.
   ``That's correct,'' Hibey replied.
   In a letter made public, Hibey told the judge, ``We have been
advised by the last doctor who examined President Marcos that he is
dying.
   ``What began as merely a request to hold Mr. Marcos' arraignment
in Honolulu rather than New York has evolved into a genuine concern
for his life,'' Hibey wrote in the letter, dated Tuesday, which
included an abbreviated doctor's report.
   LaBella, however, told Keenan that Marcos' pneumonia ``is a
reversible condition, non-chronic.'' LaBella argued it was premature
to determine if Marcos was unable to stand trial.
   The prosecutor conceded it would be four to six weeks before
Marcos could travel and asked that ``Mr. Marcos be arraigned as
promptly as possible in Hawaii.''
   No trial date has been set.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, 59, have been living in Honolulu
since fleeing Manila in 1986.
   Since his indictment in October, Marcos had asked that the
arraignment be moved to Hawaii, citing various health problems
including kidney and heart ailments. However, a government doctor
who examined Marcos there last fall pronounced him capable of
traveling to New York for arraignment.
   Mrs. Marcos came to New York in October for arraignment and was
released on $5 million bond after pleading innocent.
   The Marcoses are accused of plundering $103 million from the
Philippines treasury, funneling it to foreign bank accounts and
using it to buy prime New York real estate and art works.
   The main racketeering charge against the couple carries a maximum
20-year prison sentence upon conviction.
   Eight Marcos associates, including Saudi businessman and arms
dealer Adnan M. Khashoggi, also were indicted on various charges.

   Irving ``Ash'' Resnick, a longtime gaming figure
credited with bringing high rollers to the Las Vegas Strip, died
Wednesday. He was 72.
   Resnick died of heart failure at 1:45 a.m., said Humana Hospital
Sunrise spokeswoman Ann Lynch. He had been hospitalized after a long
bout with cancer.
   His forte was bringing high rollers to Las Vegas casinos for
high-stakes gambling, and he organized the first junkets that later
became a fixture to the casino trade.
   Resnick's Las Vegas career spanned four decades and included
stints at Caesars Palace, the Aladdin, the Dunes, the Tropicana, the
old El Rancho and Thunderbird hotels, and most recently the Maxim
Hotel.
   He was credited with starting the first baccarat game at the
Dunes. Baccarat is now featured at most Strip hotels.
   In 1974, Resnick was convicted of income tax evasion while
employed at Caesars Palace. The government alleged that Resnick
skimmed more than $300,000 from Caesars and failed to pay taxes on
it. The decision was later overturned.
   He also was troubled by allegations he had organized crime
associates and twice was the apparent victim of murder plots. In
1974, eight sticks of dynamite were found under his car and two
years later he was shot at while leaving Caesars Palace.
   Resnick, a former star basketball player at New York University,
also brought big-time boxing shows to Las Vegas.

<HEAD>Walesa Cautious On Party's Offer To Legalize Solidarity</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout with Walesa comments. Changes byline. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa today said the government's
offer to legalize Solidarity does not go far enough but that
officials had made progress toward recognizing the independent union.
   Walesa, the leader of Solidarity, said he was awaiting the
official text of the Communist Party statement, which outlines
conditions for legalization, before revealing his final position on
the offer.
   When pressed by reporters at St. Brygida's Church in the port
city of Gdansk, Walesa said: ``It is a lot for this party ... But it
is too little for social demands and expectations.''
   But he said: ``We can't destroy this possibility (of true union
freedom) but at the same time we shouldn't struggle for some
ambitious details.''
   Walesa spoke at his first news conference since the Communist
Party Central Committee cleared the way for the legalization of the
trade union federation, outlawed since 1982.
   As Walesa concluded his discussion, Poland's leader, Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski, was beginning a rare meeting with reporters in
Warsaw to discuss the developments from the party meeting.
   ``Our offer is honest and serious,'' Jaruzelski said in his
opening statement. ``I count on the fact that taking it up
constructively will allow ... a historical step in Poland's
development. That is what we all desire.''
   During an acrimonious debate, the Central Committee spent two
days devising conditions for restoring legal status to Solidarity _
Poland's most potent opposition force and the only independent labor
movement ever allowed in the Soviet bloc.
   Jaruzelski offered to resign as Communist Party leader and head
of state after encountering heated opposition to the plan, but he
then received a vote of confidence from the 230-member Central
Committee.
   The government, switching course after seven years spent trying
to eliminate Solidarity, now is seeking the organization's help in
battling Poland's severe economic problems and reforming its
political system.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski has offered to legalize
Solidarity for a two-year trial on condition it declare support for
socialism, observe a strike moratorium and give up Western financial
aid, which has exceeded $1 million a year. He recommended the offer
so long as the union agrees to act as a partner, not a ``political
opponent.''
   The resolution passed 143-42.
   Solidarity was formed in Gdansk in 1980, crushed in the
martial-law crackdown of 1981 and declared illegal the following
year.
   ``We cannot give up our independence and our sovereignty,''
Walesa said. ``If we blow it here, other people will have to deal
with the same problem again. I don't want my son and his generation
to live through such things again where it accumulates rocks and
then explodes.''
   He added, ``Conditions in Poland give enough justification to
everyone of us to strike.
   ``Everyone will be justified because the situation is so bad. But
reason shows that this leads nowhere.''
   Adam Michnik, a senior adviser to Walesa, called the plenum ``a
step forward'' and said the conditions put forth by the party are
viewed as ``a matter for discussion.''
   ``For the first time they announced at a plenum that the
legalization of Solidarity can be the subject of talks. That is new.
For the first time we have a declaration of intentions,'' Michnik
said.
   Opposition leaders have said Solidarity must be legalized before
they will sit down with the government for comprehensive talks that
were proposed during a wave of labor strife in August.
   ``Let us see,'' Michnik said when asked if Walesa now would join
in those oft-delayed talks. He called the party's new position ``a
very essential step'' but said the road ahead still is ``very
complicated.''
   Walesa said he saw as a sign of good faith from the government an
invitation to speak at two legal rallies in Warsaw next week, one at
the university. He said management at the Lenin Shipyard where he
works received an official request that he be excused for the events.
   Walesa said he will address workers at the shipyard during a
rally Friday and then speak again with reporters.
   The full text of the party's position paper on union and
political freedom is expected to be printed in Friday's newspapers.

   Reporters said farewells Thursday at the last
White House press briefing of the Reagan administration.
   ``Working in the White House is about history,'' said spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater, who stays on as press secretary in the Bush
administration.''
   ``Long after the stories of the day are forgotten, we will
remember our history together on a personal basis,'' he said.
   All seats in the briefing room were occupied, unusual in the
waning days of the administration with reporters focusing the
president-elect.
   Fitzwater noted that some of the correspondents had covered the
White House for the full eight years of the Reagan administration or
longer and that many would be back again. But he added that one
thing was sure to change.
   ``We will never again be bound by the personality, character or
decisions of Ronald Reagan,'' said Fitzwater. ``We will never judge
ourselves and each other by those perspectives again.''
   Fitzwater paid tribute to the reporters, saying, ``You have been
tough, unrelenting, thoughtful and aggressive, yet we have all had a
hell of a lot of fun, and I still think the White House press corps
is the best.''
   He also praised assistant press secretary Mark Weinberg and
Connie Gerard, who has managed the office for 2 those dinners and she'll
probably be at more, so
maybe it's more fitting that we honor her here in the pits where she
has labored for so long.''

   Barbara Bush won cheers and laughter today from
audiences that packed three theater halls to hear her joke about her
appearance and her husband's fishing.
   Mrs. Bush apeared at the ``Salute to the First Lady,'' an event
that more than 6,000 people paid $50 a ticket to attend.
   So many people came to the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts along the Potomac riverfront that Mrs. Bush made
three separate appearances _ in the Concert Hall, the Opera House
and the Eisenhower Theater.
   Known for her wit and for not putting on airs, Mrs. Bush stood on
one stage and told the audience, ``Please notice _ hairdo, makeup,
designer dress. ... Look at me good this week.''
   Dressed in a blue suit with a big patterned bow at her neck, Mrs.
Bush said she was ``a little nervous'' as she stumbled over the name
of National Symphony Orchestra music director Mstislav Rostropovich.
   Then she proceeded to joke abbut her husband's comments on how
tedious it has been for him to pack up in preparation for the move
to the White House.
   Noting he spent two days fishing last week in Florida, Mrs. Bush
said, ``So much to the packing story.''
   Mrs. Bush was introduced by Marilyn Quayle, the wife of the vice
president-elect, whose voice cracked as she described the new first
lady as a woman of ``gentleness and kindness and indomitable
spirit.''
   ``I'm going to get weepy,'' Mrs. Quayle said.
   In earlier comments, Mrs. Bush has said the feelings she has
about her husband's inauguration are like those she experienced
before her wedding day 43 years ago: She's excited but she's nervous.
   ``I'm still pinching myself,'' said Mrs. Bush, who becomes the
nation's first lady on Friday, the day George Bush is sworn in as
the 41st president.
   Mrs. Bush, a 63-year-old grandmother whose trademark is her white
hair and the three-strand choker of fake pearls, has said jokingly
that she's going to be a new kind of role model for American women.
   ``My mail tells me that a lot of fat, white-haired, wrinkled
ladies are tickled pink,'' she said in an interview with a group of
newspaper reporters last week.
   Mrs. Bush also talked about how she intends to be an activist,
promoting literacy and the needs of children, the homeless and AIDS
victims.
   But the soon-to-be first lady, known for her blunt-spoken manner
and self-deprecating sense of humor, said she doesn't plan to meddle
in her husband's business even though she's ``very candid'' about
speaking her mind.
   ``That's why we do so well,'' she said. ``I don't have to talk to
his staff. I talk to him.''
   After the election, she accompanied her husband on vacations to
Florida and Maine, but she declined to go to Texas for a
quail-hunting trip after Christmas so she could sort through her
things.
   ``Barbara's busy packing,'' Bush said. ``She's like a little girl
going off to college _ I tease her about that too.'' Bush often
refers affectionately to his wife as ``Bar.''
   Mrs. Bush said she became quite nostalgic packing up the vice
president's house, a gracious Victorian set on a hill at the Naval
Observatory a few miles from the White House. She called the move
``agony.''
   The Bushes spent Wednesday night at Blair House, the newly
renovated presidential guest quarters where they'll stay until they
go across the street to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on Friday.
   To give their new house a lived-in feeling, Mrs. Bush has invited
her mother-in-law, Dorothy Bush, 87, her five grown children and
their spouses and her 10 grandchildren to spend the first night in
the presidential mansion.
   ``There are going to be people everywhere,'' said Sondra Haley,
Mrs. Bush's spokeswoman.
   All told, 230 Bush relatives will be in the nation's capital for
the inaugural festivities. When they leave town, the Bushes will be
alone at the White House except for Millie, the couple's
brown-and-white spaniel who is expecting puppies soon.
   Despite the hassles of moving, the Bushes have done so many times
before: They've lived in 28 houses and 17 cities since their
marriage near her hometown of Rye, N.Y.
   The couple, high school sweethearts, met at a Christmas dance
when she was 16 and he was 17. Mrs. Bush, the daughter of the
publisher of McCall Corp., dropped out of Smith College after two
years to marry the future president 43 years ago after he returned a
World War II hero from the Pacific theater.
   Unlike Nancy Reagan, Mrs. Bush has no plans to renovate the White
House's public areas. Mrs. Reagan spent about $1 million
refurbishing the public rooms in 1981. The Bushes, however, will
receive $50,000 to redo their living quarters.
   The Reagans, parents of four children, spent little time with
their family at the White House, but the Bushes are a tight-knit
family and will probably see their progeny more often.
   Only one son, though, Marvin, 32, lives in the Washington area.
He is an investment consultant.
   Bush's oldest son, George Jr., 42, an oilman in Midland, Texas,
worked on his father's presidential campaign as well as in the Bush
transition office as a volunteer. He is one of his father's close
advisers.
   Married with twin 6-year-old daughters, the younger Bush once ran
unsuccessfully for Congress in Texas.
   The other Bush children are Jeb, 35, a real estate developer in
Miami; Neil, 33, in the oil business in Denver; and Dorothy LeBlond,
29, of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, who has frequently worked in her
father's campaigns.

   Hundreds of baton-wielding riot
police today violently broke up a crowd of more than 2,000 people
who rallied to demand freedom for jailed dissidents and more human
rights in Czechoslovakia.
   Chants of ``Gestapo! Gestapo!'' rang out as white-helmeted riot
police charged the crowd about 30 minutes after it gathered,
swinging their batons indiscriminantly. More than a dozen protesters
appeared badly beaten and at least 10 were taken away by police.
   Water cannons were brought onto Wenceslas Square but were not
used.
   Wenceslas Square has been the site of five straight days of
rallies, which began Sunday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of
Jan Palach's death. Palach committed suicide by setting himself
afire Jan. 16, 1969 to protest the Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia.
   Dissidents said today authorities had detained a human rights
activist and informed at least two others they will be prosecuted in
connection with demonstrations Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The public display of dissent is unprecedented since the weeks
after the 1968 invasion.
   About 15 minutes after today's rally began, a police van with a
megaphone asked the crowd to disperse, telling people they were
taking part in an illegal demonstration.
   Riot police poured into the half-mile-long square from
sidestreets when protesters refused to leave, charging the crowd and
pushing them along the boulevard.
   On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, police used water cannons, dogs,
truncheons and tear gas to break up crowds.
   Vaclav Maly, a signatory of the Charter 77 human rights document,
said activist Martin Palous was detained by police at his home
today. Palous addressed Wednesday's rally, reading a Charter 77
protest of arrests made during the earlier rallies.
   On Monday, activists Vaclav Havel and Jana Sternova were arrested
when they tried to lay flowers in memory of Palach. A prosecutor
informed activists that those two will face hooliganism charges,
Maly said. He said the charge carries a maximum jail sentence of two
years.
   Another activist, Jiri Dienstbier, said dissident Jana Petrova of
the Independent Peace Association also will be prosecuted. There
were no details on the charges. Petrova spoke at an unofficial rally
in December.
   Families of three other people detained Monday said they were
informed the detainees face charges of obstructing the duty of an
officer, which carries a maximum penalty of six months.
   In an unusual move, the names and addresses of all 14 people
detained Monday were published by the state-run media. Communist
authorities accused the dissidents and the Western media of
fomenting unrest.
   The Communist Pary daily Rude Pravo said Wednesday night that ``a
cluster of about 1,000 people in the upper half of Wenceslas Square
made the usual everyday traffic impossible.''
   ``The purpose of this unauthorized gathering was also this time
evident from chanted slogans attacking the Socialist system and its
leading representative,'' Rude Pravo said.
   At one point Wednesday, several hundred people took up a chant of
``Jakes Out,'' referring to Communist Party leader Milos Jakes.
   ``Initiators of such actions want to destabilize our society,
create pressure on the Socialist state,'' Rude Pravo said.

   A Japanese company on Thursday launched a deep-sea
research submersible capable of diving to a world-record depth of
21,325 feet, according to a government official.
   The Shinkai 6500 was christened and launched in Kobe, in western
Japan, by the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., said an official of
the Science and Technology Agency.
   Its final cost is expected to be $96 million, according to the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said it measures
31 feet by 9 feet by 10{ feet, and it weighs 25 tons.
   It can dive deeper than similar submersibles of the United
States, France and the Soviet Union, which have a depth of about
19,685 feet, he said.

   A bored hunter killing time with his gun shot out a
power line insulator, blacking out a city of 140,000 people and
causing more than $1.5 million in lost industrial production, it was
reported Thursday.
   It took almost seven hours for the power line to be repaired and
for electricity to be restored to the southern city of Maikop, about
800 miles south of Moscow, and to surrounding villages, according to
the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda.
   The outage brought Maikop factories to a halt, and caused $1.6
million in lost production, Pravda said.
   Losses totaled $190,000 at a local furniture factory and $416,000
at a plant making industrial communications equipment, it said.
   Pravda did not say when the blackout occurred, and indicated the
bored marksman had not been caught.
   ``So who is going to answer for this?'' Pravda asked.

   Police patrolled in caravans and monitored only
occasional gunshots, fires and window-breakings today. City leaders,
who set up a panel to investigate the shooting blamed for two nights
of racial rioting, expressed hope that the worst was over.
   ``It's really quiet,'' police spokesman David Rivero said today.
``We still have a perimeter around Overtown, about a two-square mile
area. We're just letting in residents or people who belong there.
Liberty City is completely open _ nothing happened there last
night.''
   He said police made about 30 arrests Wednesday night and early
today, making it a night of marked contrast to Tuesday, when 325
youths were taken into custody, most for looting.
   ``There's nothing left to loot in there, and they've already shot
out most of the street lights,'' said Coral Gables police Sgt. Wayne
Harris. He was part of a 26-man force assembled to sweep the
adjacent Coconut Grove neighborhood on Miami's south side after
seven or eight gunshots were heard and two Molotov cocktails were
tossed into roadways.
   The sweep was called off, however, because the area quieted.
   A few highway exit ramps remained blocked, and parts of Miami
were still cordoned off at night.
   In the Liberty City area on the city's north side, police
received reports of car fires, smashed store windows, a minor fire
at a fast-food restaurant and some rock- and bottle-throwing.
   And in the Overtown section just north of downtown, where the
riots began Monday night, a police ``field force'' took time for box
lunches and television viewing on the hoods of squad cars.
   City commissioners, meeting in emergency session Wednesday,
appointed a panel with subpoena power to investigate the fatal
shooting of an unarmed, 23-year-old black motorcyclist by a Hispanic
policeman. And the sister of the motorcyclist's passenger, who died
after the vehicle crashed, made a televised appeal for an end to the
violence.
   ``Put down your weapons _ I do not want my brother to be
remembered with the riots,'' Claudia Lubrin said on local television.
   The rioting that followed the killing has left one person dead,
eight shot, 13 buildings burned and numerous others looted in the
black neighborhoods. In addition about 10-15 cars were burned.
   Fire investigators have found the damage in the riot areas to be
less than first expected, said Christy LeMay, a Miami fire
department spokeswoman. Seven of the burned buildings were abandoned
and in some cases already destroyed.
   The rioting also has left image-conscious city officials
scrambling to minimize the impact on Sunday's Super Bowl. The
Cincinnati Bengals remained at their downtown hotel, just blocks
from the Overtown disturbances.
   ``What has happened the last two days has certainly taken the
glitter off the Super Bowl,'' said Dick Anderson, a former Miami
Dolphin player and chairman of a host city committee spending $2
million this week to enhance Miami's image.
   ``That's really what life is over there,'' said Bengals
quarterback Boomer Esiason. ``It really puts this game in
perspective.''
   Police deployed about 450 officers, and worked to meet sporadic
outbreaks of violence with shows of force. ``Field forces'' of
officers clad in bullet-proof vests and riot gear were stationed on
the edge of the riot-torn neighborhoods. Caravans of squad cars
raced through the areas, and SWAT teams searched for troublemakers.
   ``We hope we can normalize and go back to routine patrolling,''
said Deputy Police Chief Walter Martinez. ``We don't like being out
here 12 hours and being shot at.''
   Speaking at the city commission meeting, Mayor Xavier Suarez
apologized to police ``for actions that may have endangered their
lives unduly.''
   Suarez didn't elaborate at the meeting, but he told The New York
Times that he may have erred when he allowed the sister of the dead
motorcyclist to view her brother's body shortly after he was shot
Monday night, the Times reported today. He said her reaction
appeared to incite a group of nearby youths, who showered police
with bottles.
   ``I took the sister over to the deceased,'' Suarez said. ``I
should have done that under more controlled circumstances. All the
kids followed me. Things got out of hand. I don't believe what I did
was the trigger. In fact, I may have helped for a while by going
there and talking to people. But I would have done it differently if
I had it to do all over again.''
   The Times said Suarez later called to say that he had not
intended those comments for publication.
   Black leaders warned Suarez before the commission meeting
Wednesday that their community would no longer accept empty promises
and business as usual.
   ``The word is out that there will be more disturbance,'' said the
Rev. William Washington. ``Now we've got to act and act quick.''
   Commissioners unanimously approved the special panel to
investigate the shooting of Clement Lloyd, who was speeding with a
friend, Allen Blanchard, through Overtown. Blanchard died in a
hospital Tuesday of injuries from the motorcycle crash.
   After discussions, the commissioners approved a suggestion by
Miller Dawkins, the lone black on the five-member commission, who
wanted a board consisting of five policemen and five Overtown
residents, with the mayor as chairman.
   Dawkins said the board will not satisfy the young people throwing
rocks and bottles, and he appealed to them for time.
   ``I'd like to tell them to give us a chance to work this out, and
to work on all our other ills, such as poor housing, poor education,
joblessness,'' he said. ``And they have to work with us instead of
creating other problems like they are doing now.''
   The FBI, the State Attorney's Office and the police internal
review board are also investigating the police shooting. William
Lozano, 29, the Colombian-born police officer who shot the
motorcyclist in the head, was relieved of duty with pay pending the
investigation.
   Police Chief Perry Anderson said in an interview on ABC's
``Nightline'' that his department had ``major concerns'' about the
shooting.
   ``There seem to be some unusual circumstances,'' the police chief
said.
   Most schools that closed Tuesday reopened, although attendance
was down.
   Liberty City was the site of a 1980 race riot also linked to the
death of a black motorcylist at the hands of white police officers.
The 1980 uprising left 18 people dead. In 1982, a riot in Overtown
sparked by a police shooting caused millions of dollars of damage to
businesses and buildings.

   It's tough work deciding how to spend $2.75
million on fun, but students at Roosevelt University think they're
up to the task.
   ``They should have parties at nice hotels and get a DJ who knows
how to play really good music,'' said Beatrice Franklin, a junior.
   Marvin Moss, a Hollywood agent who died in 1986, willed the money
to his alma mater on condition that the money be spent on fun
because ``as a city-type school, I never felt students socialized as
much as they might have.''
   ``We need better food,'' Daryl McLaurine, a junior, said
Wednesday. ``I like food.''
   The administration has some different ideas. President Theodore
Gross said the school will use the money to build a gymnasium and
renovate student lounges.
   About $400,000 will be set aside to create a fund for student
activities, Gross said.
   ``They should use it to hold cheap concerts with good groups.
Nothing big _ a reunion of (rock group) Led Zeppelin or something
like that,'' said Jeff Rosenberg, a senior.

   State lotteries occasionally get to
announce winners of record jackpots. The West Virginia lottery has
recorded its biggest all-time loser.
   Somebody in Braxton County bought a ticket that turned out to be
the winner in the July 20 drawing, worth about $760,000.
   But now whoever bought that ticket can start kicking himself,
real hard.
   The deadline to claim the prize was Tuesday at 5 p.m., and no one
showed up. The money will be rolled back into the general prize fund.

   Rojo the rooster has a job now and is out of
legal trouble, which could have ended up with the bird in a stewpot.
   The 6-pound rooster ran afoul of the law for attacking a
3-year-old boy on Jan. 3, and his former owner, Bill Driggers, was
scheduled for trial Jan. 26. Driggers faced a possible $300 fine and
the rooster faced a possible death sentence.
   But now that Rojo has a job as a radio station mascot, the boy's
parents have dropped the legal action.
   ``Nobody will have to go to court,'' said Henry Brooks, director
of animal control for Richmond County.
   Radio station WRXR took the rooster off Driggers' hands.
Operations manager Tony Powers said Rojo would make public
appearances for the station, staying on Powers' father's farm in
Warrenville, S.C., the rest of the time.
   All of this has left Driggers without a pet. ``I guess that's all
she wrote, unless I get another rooster,'' he said. ``Maybe I'll get
me a duck.''

   They're a long way from the sea, but
second-graders at Webster Elementary have adopted a 4-year-old
northern Pacific humpback whale, named Flo.
   Students in the class had shown an interest in whales, so when
teacher Christie Harr was in Hawaii during the summer she contacted
the Pacific Whale Foundation and told officials her class wanted to
adopt.
   The class then received descriptions of 11 different whales.
   ``We chose Flo because we thought she might be able to have a
baby,'' said student Chris Hovey.
   The class ``wanted an extra one,'' said David Bracken.
   Flo was first spotted last January off the coast of Maui and is
identified by her unique tail pattern.
   The students received a certificate with a photograph of Flo's
tail sticking out of the water. Whenever Flo is spotted, the
foundation will write to the students and tell them her location.
   Ms. Harr said the class will plot the locations on a map to learn
about whale migration.

   _6:05 p.m, off-duty police Officer John Mervolion is sitting in a
marked patrol car when he spots two black men on a motorcycle
speeding into Overtown.

<HEAD>Spots on Taj Mahal Blamed on Restoration Material, Not Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spots marring the Taj Mahal probably came
from material used to restore the 17th century monument, not from
pollution, news reports said Thursday.
   Scientists had thought the black and yellow spots were caused by
chemical pollutants discharged from a refinery near the Taj Mahal in
the northern city of Agra.
   However, O.P. Agrawal, director of the National Research
Laboratory for the Conservation of Cultural Property, said
accumulating dirt and material used to restore the monument were to
blame, according to the United News of India.
   The study pointed to polymer resin used to renovate the monument
a few decades ago as a likely source of the problem.
   Builders completed the Taj Mahal, ordered by Shah Jahan as a
mausoleum for a favorite wife, in 1653.

<HEAD>Elderly Couple To Lose Home Used As Drug Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elderly couple who claimed they were
unaware their grandson had turned their home into a base for drug
trafficking have agreed to sell the house and split the proceeds
with the government.
   A 1987 raid on the house turned up nearly $50,000 worth of
marijuana and cocaine and a cache of weapons, including a loaded
Israeli assault rifle and riot police shotguns.
   The couple had fought forfeiture, but their attorney said
Wednesday they were satisfied with the settlement that forces the
sale and gives them half the proceeds because the house had ``too
many bad memories.'' A 1984 federal law allows the seizure of
property used in drug trafficking.
   The couple, Paul Derbacher, 79, and Ruth Derbacher, 82, had
shared their house with their grandson, Julian Derbacher, 23. He is
serving a 15-year sentence on drug charges related to the raid and
on unrelated arson and robbery convictions.
   The grandson and the couple's son, Paul Derbacher Jr., were the
targets of an investigation that led to the raid. Paul Jr. used his
parents' home in Hamden as a ``stash house'' for drugs, but he was
not charged in the case, according to court records.
   Prosecutors said drugs were in plain view in almost every room
and that the Derbachers could not have failed to notice.
   The Derbachers were granted accelerated rehabilitation on state
charges of possession of marijuana and cocaine and possession with
intent to sell. If they complete probation, the criminal charges
will be erased.
   Under the settlement, the U.S. Marshal Service will hire
contractors to fix up the property, now valued at $175,000. Robert
Casale, attorney for the couple, said the house had been ``trashed''
by the grandson.
   It could then sell for about $250,000, Casale and prosecutors
said.

   Groups pressing for a smoke-free Norway by
the year 2000 have called for raising taxes on tobacco, banning its
sale to people under 18 years old, and outlawing it in more public
places.
   The plan, handed to Social Minister Tove Strand Gerhardsen
earlier this week, builds on a law adopted last year forbidding
smoking in public areas such as theater lobbies, bus or train
terminals and most offices.
   The anti-smoking groups urged the government to adopt a new
series of measures in the next six years. They include ensuring a
smoke-free environment in schools, increasing taxes on tobacco
products and outlawing their sale to people under 18.
   The plan also calls for a smoking ban in prisons and other public
institutions, as well as in all hotel rooms and concert halls.
   The government has endorsed the goal of making Norway smokeless
by the end of the century. However, tobacco consumption in recent
years has increased by 500 tons per year.

<HEAD>How the Country Changed During Ronald Reagan's Watch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan leaves an America that's
older, eats less red meat, gives birth to fewer babies, is less
likely to divorce and has 16,741,546 more residents than when he
took over the White House eight years ago.
   The Census Bureau estimated the population at 246,879,546 as of
Jan. 1 of this year. When Reagan took office in 1981, it stood at
230,138,000.
   That means an increase of 16,741,546 people in eight years. Or a
population growth of 5,749 people-a-day under the Reagan
administration.
   Just as well, because the extra wage earners will be needed to
help pay a national debt which grew sharply over the period, rising
from $994 billion in 1981 to an anticipated $2.87 trillion by the
end of this year.
   Reagan's California is still the most populous state, of course,
and getting more entrenched every day. New York and Texas remain
second and third.
   But Florida, which ranked seventh in 1980, was up to fourth place
by 1987, having passed Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio on the way.
   Many of those new Floridians are retirees. Americans are older, a
bit, on average.
   In 1980, the median age of all Americans was 30 years. That means
half were 30 or older and half under 30.
   By 1987 the nation's median age had risen to 32.1, despite all
the new babies contributing to the overall population growth.
   Longer lives are a chief reason for the rising median age.
   When the oldest president took office, national life expectancy
was 74.2 years and 4.4 percent of the people were aged 75 and over.
   By 1987, life expectancy was up to 74.9 and nearly 5 percent were
in the 75-and-older age group. The nation's death rate fell from 8.8
per 1,000 people in 1980 to 8.7 in 1987.
   At the other end of the lifespan, infant mortality has declined
sharply, from 12.6 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 10
in 1987.
   Perhaps helping in this was the increase in physicians during
this period. In 1980 there were 211 doctors for every 100,000
Americans, while by 1985 that had climbed to 237 per 100,000.
   The nation's birth rate has dropped during the Reagan years.
   The National Center for Health Statistics reported that 15.9
babies were born in 1980 for every 1,000 Americans. By 1987 that was
down to 15.7.
   The number of orphans has also dropped, from 52,000 children who
had lost both parents in 1980 to 30,000 in 1986.
   Marriage seems to have grown somewhat less attractive during the
eight-year Reagan span. In 1980 there were 10.6 marriages for every
1,000 people. By 1987 that rate had fallen to 9.9 per 1,000.
   The number of unmarried couples living together rose 63 percent
to 2.6 million from 1980 to 1988.
   At the same time, divorce has become less common, with the rate
dropping from 5.2 per 1,000 in 1980 to 4.8 in 1987.
   Overall, though, the majority of households still consist of
families that include a married couple _ though the share slipped
from 60.8 percent to 56.9 percent from 1980 to 1988.
   The divorce rate has fallen _ even though the number of lawyers
in the country grew from 542,205 in 1980 to 655,191 in 1985.
   Crime offered fewer job opportunities for lawyers, too. The
reported crime rate fell from 5,950 per 100,000 people in 1980 to
5,480 in 1986. But the populations of the federal and state state
prisons climbed from 315,974 in 1980 to 523,922 in 1986.
   On a more individual front, Americans have made some changes in
their personal habits in recent years.
   In 1980 U.S. residents ate an average of 157.2 pounds of red
meat. By 1986 than had fallen to 150.5 pounds.
   At the same time fish consumption climbed from 12.8 pounds to
14.7 pounds.
   Americans eat a lot more chicken, 59.1 pounds, up from 50.1
pounds in 1980. Grain consumption jumped from 116.9 pounds to 129.6
pounds while the average for fresh vegetables went from 72.6 pounds
to 79.4 pounds and fresh fruit rose from 86.7 pounds to 91.4 pounds
per person per year.
   Alcohol imbibing fell during the 1980 to 1986 period, from 29.3
gallons to 27.6 gallons per capita, even though total consumption of
beverages rose from 135.7 gallons to 140.3 gallons.
   Soft drinks gained, from 37.8 gallons to 45.6 gallons over the
period, while juices increased from 6.3 gallons to 7.3 gallons.
There were modest declines reported in consumption of milk, coffee
and tea.
   At another level, the United States grew during the Reagan years
_ or at least came to assert an economic interest over millions more
square miles than it did before Reagan.
   On March 10, 1983, Reagan proclaimed an Exclusive Economic Zone,
extending U.S. interests to the area 200 miles off the coasts. The
EEZ is not a claim to jurisdiction over territorial waters, but it
amounts to an assertion of U.S. mineral and fishing rights within
the entire zone. However, foreign ships and aircraft can still pass
freely through the economic zone.
   The EEZ totals 4.4 million square miles, larger than the nation's
3.6 million square miles.

<HEAD>Boeing Hoping To Make Crossed Wires `Physically Impossible'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. says it is reviewing design, testing
and maintenance to make it ``physically impossible'' to make wiring
errors like those found in seven Boeing 757s.
   The Federal Aviation Administration last week ordered checks on
all 757s after learning of faulty wiring in the cargo hold fire
extinguishing systems in a Royal Brunei jet and a similar problem in
a Delta Airlines plane.
   Faulty wiring has been found in five more 757s since the
inspections were ordered.
   Investigators said some of the crossed wires would have caused
the wrong extinguisher to work in the event of a cargo hold fire;
other mistakes would have indicated a fire to the pilot without
activating a sprinkler.
   Boeing on Wednesday said that of the 205 of the twin-engine,
mid-sized airliners in use worldwide, 191 have been examined, and
three foreign carriers have yet to report findings on the remaining
24.
   ``We'll go back and look at the design work to see what kinds of
physical things we can do so that it would be physically impossible
for the installer to make a mistake,'' Jack Gamble of Boeing
Commercial Airplanes said Wednesday.
   ``We will look at the testing procedures to see if we should
devise some additional ways of testing as a cross check.''
   The 757 went into service in 1984. All the miswired planes were
manufactured around 1986, and none had had cargo-hold fires, Gamble
said.
   Gamble maintenance manuals would be reviewed because the company
has yet to rule out wiring errors during maintenance.
   ``There were seven airplanes and seven mistakes, and there was no
pattern to lead us to believe that they came from the same spot,''
he said.
   A separate check of some newer Boeing 737s in Great Britain and
the United States found no wiring problems, Boeing said.
   Those inspections resulted from speculation that crossed wires
might have led the pilot of a British Midland 737-400 to shut down
his undamaged right engine after the left caught fire, resulting in
a crash that killed 44 this month.
   Boeing has required maximum overtime and hired new workers in the
past year to meet tight delivery schedules for planes and parts, but
Boeing, FAA and airline officials said they remained confident about
the level of quality.
   ``Everything that is done by Boeing is subject to a quality
control process that is monitored constantly, and we don't believe
there is a concern at this point,'' said Mitch Barker, an FAA
spokesman.

   Paintings of glamorous women with exotic
names are returning to the noses of some of the Air Force's bombers.
   Some women's rights groups say the World War II-era art form
should have been left in the 1940s.
   ``Why do they do this to us?'' asked Junior Bridge, a spokeswoman
for the National Organization for Women in Washington, after hearing
a description of the artwork: mostly busty women long on legs and
short on clothes.
   ``I would hope that chapter had been closed,'' Mary Ruthsdaughter
of the National Women's History Project in Santa Rosa, Calif., said
Wednesday.
   The paintings and the use of nicknames for planes returned in
1985 at some Strategic Air Command bases only, said Maj. Dennis
Pierson at SAC headquarters in Omaha, Neb. SAC has about 40 major
bases in the United States and overseas.
   The program is warming the hearts of pilots in SAC's snowiest
post, K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   ``They love it. There is a lot of personal pride,'' said Lt. Col.
John Walther, assistant deputy commander of operations at the base.
``The command is trying real hard to upgrade how the airplanes look
and fly.''
   The art also adds personality, said Sawyer spokesman Capt. Paul
Bicking.
   B-52H-0060 is now known as Diamond Girl. Bomber number 0038 has
become .38 Special, displaying a busty figure in a bikini, while
0047 is a leggy Classy Chassis.
   There are some differences from the flashy, sometimes gaudy
paintings that adorned planes in World War II.
   These days, the lovely ladies painted over dull grayish-black
camouflage paint are in subdued, less visible hues of dusky red and
shady blue.
   Sawyer also has added subdued rainbows to the tails of its KC-135
tankers, borrowing the rainbow logo and ``Somewhere Else'' slogan of
a local TV station.

<HEAD>Catholic Prelates Urge Southern Africa Foes to Disarm, Talk Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic bishops from nine southern
African nations Thursday appealed to their governments and
guerrillas in the region to make peace.
   ``Listen to us,'' the bishops implored in a 21-page Lenten
pastoral letter. ``Lay down your arms.''
   The letter, written after three years of research and approved by
Pope John Paul II when he visited Zimbabwe in September, was
published in Harare by the Inter-regional Meeting of Bishops of
Southern Africa.
   The prelates represent Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique,
Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, South Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.
   Except for Sao Tome and Principe, each nation has suffered from
regional conflicts in which hundreds of thousands of people have
been killed, countless others maimed and still others driven into
exile as refugees.
   Bishop Patrick Mutume of Zimbabwe described the letter as a
blueprint for peace in Southern Africa.
   ``Both sides must lay down their arms,'' Mutume said at a news
conference. ``The call is not for only one side. ... Everybody must
talk.''
   The letter says it is a ``main function of the state to provide
security for its citizens, but the wars that have been dragging on
in Southern Africa for years show that war does not provide security
for peoples but provides hatred and destruction.''
   ``We believe there is only one alternative to be followed, that
of negotiation,'' the letter says.
   It was signed by the chairman of the bishops' group, Jaime
Goncalves, archbishop of the Beira Diocese in Mozambique.
   Mozambique President Joaquim Chissano censured Goncalves last
year for urging peace talks with right-wing rebels in the former
Portuguese colony.
   Mutume said the bishops' appeal was directed as much at South
Africa and guerrillas fighting its white-run government as it was at
countries such as Mozambique.
   The peace accord recently signed by Angola, Cuba and South Africa
was a sign of hope for the region, the pastoral letter said. The
pact promises independence for Namibia, a territory now governed by
South Africa, in return for the withdrawal of 50,000 troops from
neighboring Angola.
   The bishops attacked capitalist and socialist systems in the
region, saying both caused unemployment, poverty and hunger.
   They also described South Africa's apartheid policy of racial
segregation as ``a flagrantly unjust system which, by law as well as
practice, discriminates against the ethnic majority of that country
and denies them land, economic and political rights.''
   ``We express our outrage and horror at this system of oppression
which insults the dignity of the human person and is an offense
against God,'' the letter said.
   The bishops also rapped Angola's Marxist government for
discriminating against Christians, a practice the letter said was
``a new form of apartheid ... no less grave.''
   They reiterated their support for non-violent community action
and protest when prolonged systematic injustices could not be
reversed.

<TEXT>
   A state Circuit Court judge today refused
to block Tuesday's scheduled execution of triple killer Ted Bundy,
who faces his fourth execution date.
   Judge John Peach denied three claims in Bundy's appeal filed in
the North Florida City where Bundy abducted his last victim.
   ``It's time ... we're approaching the 11th anniverary of the
death of Kimberly Leach and Ted Bundy is still alive,'' said
Columbia County state attorney Jerry Blair, who prosecuted Bundy for
the 1978 murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach.
   Unless he wins a stay, the 42-year-old former law student _ once
on the FBI's most-wanted list as a suspect in as many as 36
sex-related murders and disappearances _ is scheduled to die in
Florida's electric chair on Tuesday.
   ``I think we should have won, but we'll win because his claims
are valid,'' said James Coleman, a Washington D.C. attorney
representing Bundy. He said the case would be heard Friday by the
Florida Supreme Court.
   The appeal centered on three issues: Bundy's competence at the
time he rejected a plea bargain agreement that would have kept him
from the electric chair; ongoing litigation in a separate case in
which Bundy was convicted of murdering two Florida State University
sorority sisters, and claims that the original trial judge received
material from the prosecution that the defense didn't know about.
   All were rejected by Peach, who heard the arguments after Circuit
Judge Wallace M. Jopling disqualified himself in response to a
motion by Bundy's attorneys.
   Bundy's attorneys say he should be given time to reveal what he
knows about dozens of unsolved slayings, but Gov. Bob Martinez says
Bundy is just trying to foil justice.
   Bundy, whose case was depicted in the television miniseries ``The
Deliberate Stranger,'' was sentenced to death for the February 1978
murder of Miss Leach, of Lake City. He also was sentenced to death
for fatally bludgeoning two Florida State University sorority
sisters.
   Bundy's civil attorney, Diana Weiner of Sarasota, on Wednesday
told the governor's death-penalty lawyer, Andrea Smith Hillyer, that
Bundy was committed to revealing all he knew about unsolved murders.
Weiner didn't specify which cases.
   ``Ted Bundy feels morally compelled as he faces death to do the
right thing in terms of resolving any investigations,'' she said.
``While it may satisfyingly close the book on the Florida cases, the
immediate execution will effectively cripple law enforcement
agencies around the country.''
   Martinez disagreed, but said he would make Bundy available to any
law agency in the days remaining before the execution.
   ``I know that he has basically lied through this entire process
and why anyone would believe he would tell the truth now is beyond
me,'' Martinez said. ``We're not going to have the system
manipulated.
   ``One of the things to be made clear here to law enforcement,
which I think they realize more than anyone else what Ted Bundy has
done, is you don't negotiate with a murderer. You don't negotiate
with a killer,'' Martinez said.
   Martinez signed the death warrant on Tuesday, less than a hour
after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear new arguments to set
aside Bundy's death sentence.
   Bundy has insisted he is innocent of any murder.
   Bob Keppel of the Washington state attorney general's office has
told Florida officials he wants to talk with Bundy, who has been
linked to eight killings in that state.
   The FBI's National Center for Violent Crime in Quantico, Va.,
also wants to interview Bundy, authorities said.
   In Utah, Salt Lake County Sheriff Pete Hayward said he is sending
Detective Dennis Couch to Florida Saturday morning in hopes of
interviewing Bundy, a former University of Utah law student.
   But Salt Lake Detective Dennis Couch said Bundy told officials
Wednesday he would not meet with him.
   Also announced Wednesday was Bundy's decision to grant an
interview to James Dobson, host of a Pomona, Calif.,-based radio
show called ``Focus on the Family.''
   Dobson said he has exchanged letters with Bundy for the past two
years. He said he didn't know what Bundy wants to discuss.
   ``When a man is looking death in the face, he doesn't waste words
and I want to hear what he has to say,'' said Dobson, who has a
30-minute Christian-oriented radio show.
   Bundy has been granted a stay of execution three times before.
The last was issued Nov. 17, 1986, six hours before his scheduled
execution, when the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
sent the case back for an evidentiary hearing. The appeals court,
and later the U.S. Supreme Court, rejected the appeal.

   Floods fed by a week of heavy rain
swept through villages, washed away homes, and left 13 people dead
and four missing, news reports said Thursday.
   Seven people died when their boat sank in a flood-swollen river
in Riau province, the newspaper Suara Pembaruan reported.
   Heavy rain flooded 105 villages in the region about 600 miles
northwest of Jakarta, the paper said, quoting local official
Asparaini Rasyad.
   The paper did not say which day the deaths occurred.
   Another flood killed six people, including a 2-year-old girl, in
nearby West Sumatra province, the official Antara news agency
reported. It said four people still were missing after that flood
Tuesday.
   The flood washed away four houses, the agency said.

<HEAD>Japanese Companies to Stop Publishing `Sambo' Stories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese publishers said Thursday they have stopped
publishing the popular ``Little Black Sambo'' because of its racial
overtones.
   Iwanami Shoten, the first Japanese publisher to introduce the
story to this country, decided in December not to reprint it, said
Hisao Ogawa, chief editor of the company's children's books division.
   He said the company recently discovered the book had overtones of
racial descrimination. ``We can't deny that the name `Sambo' and
pictures represented discrimination,'' he said.
   The original book, written by Helen Bannerman in Britain in 1899
for her daughter, is an adventure tale about a black boy and tigers.
   Other major Japanese publishing companies decided earlier to
discontinue printing and marketing the book.
   A representative for one of them, Shogakukan Ltd., said Thursday
it also decided to stop selling the stories because the boy's name
had connotations of racial discrimination.
   ``None of us had been aware that the book contained racial
discrimination until it was pointed out,'' said the official, on
condition of anonymity.

   The State Department said Thursday it has
instructed American displomats to discourage foreign leaders from
attending the inaugural festivities swirling through Washington this
week.
   Their regular ambassadors will represent foreign countries at the
inauguration Friday on the Capitol steps. The envoys then will go by
bus the two miles to Blair House, the place where presidential
guests stay, across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.
   There they will view the parade from reserved seats.
   Government officials fine tuning the arrangements were describing
the seats among themselves as ``the ambassadors' bleachers.''
   Blair House itself was the site of a reunion between Bush and the
World War II submariners who rescued him when the Japanese downed
his plane in 1944.
   Unlike many other countries, the United States does not
ordinarily invite foreign leaders to the installation of a new
administration, said Richard Gookin, associate chief of protocol at
the State Department.
   In contrast, Vice President-elect Dan Quayle has been named to
represent the United States at the inauguration Feb. 3 of Carlos
Andres Perez as president of Venezuela. Leaders from Latin America
and throughout the world are expected to attend.
   Gookin said a Dec. 15 memo to U.S. diplomatic missions told
American diplomats to ask that special delegations not be sent to
the inauguration. It cited the essentially American nature of the
occasion, lack of accommodations and a desire to keep events simple.
   As many as 300,000 people are expected in Washington for the
weekend. On Wednesday night the inaugural dinner _ price: $1,500 a
plate _ had to be held in three different sites, with Bush making an
appearance at each. Advocates of the poor and homeless set up a
``counter-banquet'' at one site.
   There will be dozens of balls and other events.
   Costs are being paid largely by private companies and
arrangements are made by a private committee, which counters
criticism that public money is being spent on social entertainment
rather than social needs.
   According to Gookin, the mmessage told from the State Department
told the American diplomats to assure other governments that
ambassadors in Washington and their wives would be accommodated.

   A state legislator is going on the
offensive against ``fax attacks'' _ unsolicited advertising received
over facsimile machines.
   Rep. Richard Tulisano, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said
Wednesday he has proposed a bill banning the use of fax machines to
send unsolicited ads.
   ``As fax machines become more prevalent, they become a vehicle
for unsolicited advertisements, thereby tying up not only your
machine but using your papers, all your fluids, and all that
stuff,'' said Tulisano, who added that he planned to buy a fax
machine soon.
   Fax machines permit users to send and receive copies of documents
over telephone lines.
   A legislative research report on Tulisano's bill found that
facsimile paper costs up to 10 cents a page.
   Donna Murdoch, executive director of the American Fascimile
Association in Philadelphia, which publishes a newsletter for
facsimile users, said the debate over ``junk fax'' is much ado about
nothing.
   ``We ask people, `How many pieces of junk fax are you really
getting?''' she said. ``And people say the most they can remember
getting is two pieces in a week.''
   Mr. Fax, a company based in Irvine, Calif., sells facsimile
supplies via unsolicited fax ads. ``We think this is a very
low-cost, convenient method of marketing,'' said Elliott Segal, vice
president for marketing.
   Segal said laws against unsolicited fax messages would ``punish
the entire fax population for something that has generated
relatively few complaints.''

   It was that moment everybody worries about:
You're walking down the aisle at a wedding, or climbing the steps to
get your diploma, and you trip.
   For Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., it came Thursday as she escorted
President-elect Bush up steps onto a stage at the District of
Columbia Armory before several thousand cheering teenagers.
   The Illinois congresswoman, who was emceeing the inaugural youth
event, stumbled as she reached the top of the stairs. Only a quick
hand from Bush and Stephen M. Studdert, the inaugural executive
director, kept her from hitting the deck.
   For Bush, the stumble could not pass unnoticed.
   ``About the dramatic entrance by my friend Lynn Martin ... she
will do anything to upstage the president-elect of the United States
_ shameless!'' he said wryly.
   While Martin joined in the laughter, Bush turned serious and
urged the high school students to ``take on Lynn Martin as a role
model. Watch her leadership in the United States Congress. She's
tough, she's strong and she exemplifies the very best in public
service.''
   ``I'm proud to have her at my side, standing or falling,'' he
added.
   Afterwards, in her own turn at the microphone, Martin said,
``It's something we all dreaded if you had an eighth grade
graduation or you stood up in a wedding, or when you graduate from
high school: will you trip going up or down the stairs?
   ``I never did then. I waited until now so I could do it in front
of thousands of people,'' she said.
   ``But there's kind of a lesson. I guess you just get up. And it's
kind of nice to get a hand from the president of the United States.''

   Mayor Charles Royer announced today that he will
not seek a fourth term and said he had no specific plans for the
future.
   Royer, 49, a former journalist who was elected mayor in 1977, won
re-election in 1981 and an unprecedented third term in 1985. His
office is up for election again in November.
   ``All I have ruled out is running for elective office in the
immediate future,'' he said. ``I do know this: I love public
service. It's fulfilling and I'm pretty good at it.''
   Royer said, ``I love this job,'' but that he needs new challenges
and new growth after serving 12 years as mayor of the Northwest's
largest city, which has about 500,000 residents.
   Royer, a Democrat, listed some of his accomplishments and looked
to the future.
   ``In 1989, we must reduce contention and division over growth and
build consensus on how we grow,'' he said. Royer also said the city
must continue the fight against drugs and ``invest more in our kids'
future.''
   The mayor, accompanied by his wife, Rosanne, said he leaves a
city government that is fiscally strong.
   Royer's lone venture into statewide politics was in 1983, when he
ran for the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by the sudden death of Sen.
Henry Jackson that September. Royer finished second among Democrats
in that special election to Congressman Mike Lowry, who eventually
lost to Republican Dan Evans.
   Before entering politics, Royer was a newspaper and television
journalist in Oregon and Seattle. He is a University of Oregon
graduate.

   Housing construction dropped 8.2 percent in
1988 to its lowest level in six years, the government reported
Thursday, but analysts said the industry remained in good shape as
it weathered a moderate slowdown after the post-recession boom.
   Construction of both single-family homes and apartments fell
during 1988 to leave total housing starts at 1.49 million units. It
was the poorest showing since the recession year of 1982 when 1.06
million units were built.
   Analysts said that despite the decline, which is likely to
continue into the current year, 1988 was a good year for the housing
industry because the level of construction remained relatively high.
   ``We do not get very concerned when we're building over a million
single-family homes a year,'' said Dale Stuard, president of the
National Association of Homebuilders.
   ``There's nothing to get panicky about,'' he said. ``It's a very
controlled slowdown.''
   Analysts said the decline had been expected because much of the
pent-up demand for homes that developed during the recession was
satisfied in subsequent boom years, and housing requirements are
decreasing with the aging of the Baby Boom generation.
   In addition, mortgage interest rates are inching upward. Interest
on fixed-rate mortgages reached 10.81 percent last week, according
to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Economist Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions said the housing industry ``held up reasonably well,
all things considered. Nonetheless, it is a decline and I think
we'll see a little further decline in 1989.''
   Housing construction reached its post-recession peak in 1986,
when 1.81 units were built, then began sliding. Analysts believe
further decreases are inevitable as interest rates continue to rise,
the economic expansion runs its course and demographics take their
toll.
   ``As we go through the years toward the year 2000, we need fewer
and fewer net additions to our stock of housing,'' said economist
Richard Peach of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
``We're just not creating as many new households as we used to.''
   December's seasonally adjusted annual construction rate of 1.52
million units was down a moderate 2.2 percent from a month earlier.
   ``The small drop from November is encouraging, and suggests that
the housing sector will start 1989 with good momentum,'' said John
A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of
Realtors.
   Building permits, considered a good indication of future
activity, were up 1.8 percent in December to an annual rate of 1.54
million units. For the year, building permits totaled 1.46 million
units, down from 1.53 million a year earlier.
   Single-family homes in December were built at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.11 million units, down 1.9 percent from a
month earlier. For the year, single-family home construction dropped
5.8 percent to 1.08 million units.
   Apartment construction, always volatile, reached an annual rate
of 410,000 units during December, down 3.1 percent from a month
earlier. For the year, construction was down 14.1 percent to 407,000
units.
   The apartment sector has been plagued by widespread overbuilding
and changes in federal tax law that removed many of the incentives
for investing in rental projects.
   All four regions of the country experienced decreased housing
starts during the year, with construction in the Northeast down 12.5
percent, the South down 9.3 percent, the Midwest down 8.5 percent
and the West down 3.6 percent.
   But construction in the Midwest shot up 25.1 percent in December
to a seasonally adjusted 329,000 units, the fourth straight monthly
increase. Peach said the recent gains indicate the region ``is on a
longer-term trend of recovery from the days when everyone called it
the Rust Belt.''
   The Northeast, meanwhile, was down 20.1 percent in December to
179,000 units, reflecting a slowdown after strong expansion earlier.
   Economist Martin Regalia of the National Council of Savings
Institutions said there could be ``cause for concern'' if the
slowdown in the Northeast continues, but that the downward movement
thus far was not alarming.

<HEAD>Reagan Feared For Hostages Safety</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 5-6, On Jan. 7, to include Reagan's earlier criticism
of Carter's handling of hostage situation.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan acknowledged today that he
leaves office ``without a hint or a clue'' as to the whereabouts of
Americans held hostage in Lebanon and said any overt rescue attempt
could risk their execution.
   ``We don't know where they are,'' Reagan said in a farewell
interview with news service reporters.
   The president said that while he feels badly about the hostages
languishing in the hands of pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon, the
situation should not be likened to the one that existed when he came
to office in January 1981.
   Fifty-two Americans held hostage in Tehran were released on Jan.
20, 1981 _ the same day Reagan was inaugurated and President Jimmy
Carter left office. Reagan had criticized Carter during the 1980
campaign for having been unable to win the hostages' release.
   On Jan. 7, 1980, while campaigning for the GOP presidential
nomination in the New Hampshire primary, Reagan said Carter's
response to the taking of American hostages in Iran was ``too
sluggish.''
   ``I believe it's appropriate to suggest that anything that has
been done by the administration so far, could have, should have,
been done in the first hour,'' Reagan said. The United States should
have ordered an economic boycott, hesaid, and set a deadline beyond
which the boycotted country could not go without serious harm to
itself.
   In today's interview, Reagan did not take back that criticism.
   ``We were facing two very different situations,'' he said, noting
that in the earlier situation, more than 50 people had been held in
an embassy, and that they had been kidnapped by the government of
Iran. ``This is another one, in which some terrorist group has
kidnapped several individuals,'' he said.
   ``We know that any overt attempt at rescue, even if we did have a
hint or a clue, could run the risk of their assassination or
execution before we could get them out,'' Reagan said. ``There
hasn't been a moment that this hasn't been on my mind. ... I think
the two situations are completely different.''
   Reagan said, however, that at the end of Carter's term, ``I made
a number of statements and so forth that were aimed at helping. In
other words, portraying myself and the things I said, to that
government that was holding them, that maybe they'd rather deal with
him than wait and deal with me.''
   During a wide-ranging half-hour interview in the Oval Office, one
of a spate that Reagan has granted as his presidency draws to an
end, he also said:
   _``A technical state of war does still exist'' between Israel and
the Arab nations and U.S. officials believe that ``peace can only
come about when the principals themselves agree to negotiations.''
   _He did not know of any presidential pardons ``that are
imminent,'' although he did not rule out any eleventh-hour pardons.
``It doesn't seem very likely,'' he said.
   _He still believes that former White House aides Oliver L. North
and John M. Poindexter eventually will be cleared of any criminal
wrongdoing in the Iran-Contra case and he believes trials should
proceed so there will be no lingering doubt about their innocence.
   _He appreciates the potential of U.S. military power and the
responsibility of a president, saying ``I don't think there has ever
been a moment'' in his eight-year presidency when he had to consider
ordering a nuclear attack.
   ``I'm quite sure we'd never be the first to press the button,''
Reagan said.
   Reagan said he would not give unsolicited advice to
President-elect Bush after leaving office Friday, but would try to
help if asked.
   On the question of U.S. dealings with the Soviet Union, Reagan
said he thought Bush would move forward on the issue of reducing the
superpower stockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons, but that
caution should be used.
   ``I think we have to realize that in these negotiations ...
they're not just based on what someone says. They're based on
deeds,'' he said. ``And I think that George will be very prepared
there, based on what the deeds are.''
   Reagan said he does not believe that he is less popular in Europe
than Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, as some polls have shown.
   ``I can't quite accept that he's more popular than I am,'' Reagan
said.
   The president criticized what he called a ``total media
distortion'' of the nature of covert U.S. arms sales to Iran in
1985-86 through Israel.
   Reagan said that the initiative got under way ``at a time when
everyone was saying that the ayatollah was not going to live out the
week.'' He repeated his oft-stated position that the sales of
anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles to elements in Iran did not
amount to trading arms for hostages.
   Reagan said U.S. arms were sold to moderates in Iran who would
``turn it over, not to the revolutionary government of Iran, but to
the regular military, which had been created ... in large part by
the United States ... and it would give them the prestige they need
if they were to be able to take over the government and establish a
democratic government there.''

<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in a
strong show of bipartisan support, voted 19-0 Thursday to recommend
the Senate confirm James A. Baker III as secretary of state.
   The Senate is expected to approve the Baker nomination, possibly
unanimously, in a roll call vote next Wednesday.
   Baker, 58, who served President Reagan as White House chief of
staff and secretrary of the Treasury, is one of President-elect
George Bush's closest friends and managed his 1980 and 1988
presidential campaigns.
   In two days of testimony this week, he displayed a comprehensive
grasp of foreign policy issues, issuing a strong call for a new era
of bipartisanship as the keystone to success.
   He said this was especially true in Central America, where
wrangling between the Reagan White House and Congress led, Baker
said, to stalemate and a distinct lack of success in dealing with
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   On a note of caution, Baker said the United States should
exercise restraint in its relations with the Soviet Union, viewing
the domestic, foreign policy and defense changes being made by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev with prudence and realism.
   He endorsed the general outlines of Reagan administration foreign
policy while sidestepping questions about any specific changes Bush
may make or specific initiatives he may undertake.
   After the panel's unanimous vote, committee members hailed Baker
in high terms.
   The chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said the vote
represents ``approval for Baker as a man, a belief in him as an
experienced and able public servant.''
   Pell said the vote did not indicate that the committee's
Democratic majority will agree with Baker on every foreign policy
issue over the next four years.
   ``But we are certainly starting out on a more even keel'' Pell
said.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said he believes the unanimous
nature of the vote represents ``a bipartisan approach to the new
administration.''
   Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., said of Baker, ``He's one of the all
time Washinagton greats.''
   ``I am very optimistic he is going to be an outstanding secretary
of state,'' said Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md. ``He has diplomacy,
restraint and carefulness. I think he's the kind of person that
would work very well with Congress.''

<HEAD>More Evidence Finds Heredity Plays Role in Multiple Sclerosis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least two genes play a role in the
development of multiple sclerosis, a finding that supports earlier
studies that susceptibility to the crippling disease is powerfully
influenced by heredity, a researcher said Thursday.
   Dr. Dale E. McFarlin, a researcher at the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said he and colleagues at the
California Institute of Technology and the University of California
in Los Angeles have found that certain combinations of T-cell
receptor genes occur more often in MS patients than in healthy
people.
   ``What this suggests is that there is a genetic component in MS,
but there is more than one gene,'' McFarlin said in a telephone
interview.
   McFarlin said that though the study shows heredity may increase a
person's susceptibility to MS, the disease ``is not purely
genetic.'' Other components, as yet unknown, also must be present
for multiple sclerosis to develop, he said.
   Multiple sclerosis is a disease of unknown origin that attacks
the tissue covering nerves in the brain and spinal column. This can
result in vision disturbances, weakness and eventually crippling
disability. No successful treatment for the disease has been found.
   McFarlin said earlier studies showed a gene that reacts to an
antigen called DR2 may play a role in multiple sclerosis. Now, the
new study shows that a combination of genes that help build the
T-cell receptor also is involved in the disease.
   The T-cell is a disease-fighting cell produced by the immune
system. Molecules on the surface of the T-cell, called receptors,
lock onto antigens, which are molecules recognized by the immune
system as foreign bodies, such as germs.
   McFarlin said that the new study has shown that patients who have
an abnormal combination of T-cell genes plus an elevated level of
DR2 antigen are three times as likely to develop MS as healthy
people without these genetic characteristics.
   The study focused on a group that includes the T-cell genes, said
McFarlin, but the specific gene in that group that plays a role in
MS has not been identified.
   ``More work needs to be done on that,'' he said.
   The study was published in the Journal of Neuroimmunology.

   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Thursday it will try to keep the nation from losing any more swamps,
marshes and other wetlands, a conservation goal President-elect Bush
endorsed during the campaign.
   Any unavoidable losses should be ``fully offset by wetlands
restoration or creation,'' the agency said.
   Such a goal was recommended last November by a study group led by
New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean under the sponsorship of the
Conservation Foundation. Bush had earlier said the nation should aim
for a ``no net loss'' wetlands policy.
   Since then, Bush has chosen William Reilly, the foundation's
president, to head the EPA.
   The agency said it would step up enforcement of existing water
pollution laws dealing with wetlands, cooperate more closely with
other federal agencies and encourage the states to develop
protection programs.
   Much wetlands decision-making is in the hands of the states and
local governments. The principal federal power is the authority of
the Army Corps of Engineers to grant permits for putting fill in
waterways and wetlands, a process over which the EPA has certain
veto powers.
   The agency can delegate those powers to the states; so far only
Michigan has been granted that authority.
   Gail Bingham, vice president of the foundation, said, ``We are
delighted'' with EPA's new policy.
   Thought for generations to be nothing more than the breeding
grounds of disease, wetlands today are recognized by
conservationists as an important cog in nature's machine, playing
important roles in water purification and storage; as a habitat for
wildlife, including many endangered species, and in the productivity
of marine life, including commercially important species.
   The study group noted, however, that wetlands often are sought by
developers as the only close-in land to large urban areas.
   Of the 200 million acres of fens, bogs, marshes, estuaries,
swamps and other wetlands in the United States at the time of
settlement by Europeans in the 17th Century, about half remain.
   There are no good estimates of how much is lost each year. One
widely cited estimate of 450,000 acres annually was made in the
1970s, when farmers were believed to be bringing more wetlands under
the plow than they are now. The Conservation Foundation uses a range
of 200,000 acres to 450,000 acres.

   They yawned, they squinted, they fidgeted and
they sang _ 76 boys with voices like angels, rehearsing Thursday for
the three-minute performance that will put their county on the map.
Again.
   More than 50 years after coal mining union battles left the
legacy of Bloody Harlan, the Harlan (Ky.) Boys Choir stood on the
West Front of the Capitol singing ``This Is My Country'' in
four-part harmony.
   ``Bass and tenor, you need to tone down a bit. Sing away from
that mike,'' director David Davies barked at his boys, a bunch of
10-to-19-year-olds in jeans, sneakers and bright green boys choir
jackets.
   ``You were shifting your feet. You were moving your eyes. And
you're scratching your noses!'' he shouted incredulously. ``Don't
scratch your noses''
   It was a jarring note of reality in the fairy tale of how the
24-year-old choir won a place in the brief inaugural ceremony, a
slot normally reserved for star entertainers or hometown favorites
of the president-elect.
   While the final decision was up to George Bush, it didn't hurt
that the chairman of the inaugural proceedings is Sen. Wendell Ford,
D-Ky.
   ``I've been kin to you for a long time,'' Ford told the boys
before their run-through in the midday sun. In 1972, as governor, he
gave them $5,000 from a contingency fund for a trip to compete in
Graz, Austria. This year, he's playing proud host and Dutch uncle.
   Told that the choir raised $51,000 for its trip to Washington,
more than twice its $25,000 goal, Ford commented: ``See what
charisma you have? What drawing power? Now fellas, don't think it's
going to be that easy in the real world.''
   They've been all over the country, as well as to Europe, but the
boys and parents agree: this trip tops all.
   ``This is the zenith. It's just awesome. The boys just can't
believe it,'' said Dawn Nunez, the finance chairman, whose
17-year-old son Matt has been in the choir for eight years.
   ``Everything's larger than life. It doesn't seem real because
there's so much history,'' said choir president Richard Atkins, 17.
``I'm a little more relaxed than I thought I would be,'' said Seth
Spoelman, 14.
   All the boys are from Harlan County's 1,200-student school
system. They come from all racial and economic backgrounds, the sons
of insurance agents and coal miners as well as doctors and lawyers.
   ``We've got football players, basketball players. This is the in
thing to do at our school,'' said Mrs. Nunez. ``It's not considered
a sissy thing,'' agreed Roy Allison, the choir's business manager.
   Mrs. Nunez, who was in charge of raising money for the choir's
trip, said her job was easy. ``We didn't even have to ask. Many
donations weren't even solicited,'' she said. ``People know that we
have met our goal and they're still sending in money.''
   The biggest contribution was $5,000 from The New York Times, she
said. The Kentucky governor gave $3,000 and a few anonymous donors
gave $1,000 apiece, she said, but most of the money came in small
chunks from local businesses and residents.
   ``Music is a big thing in the hills of Kentucky,'' she said.
``Whenever the choir does something, the community gets behind it.''
   ``It's supposed to be a mean place. Bloody Harlan, it's been
called. We've never been able to live that down,'' said Allison.
``But I couldn't tell you when there was a mugging in Harlan, when a
woman was raped, when there was an armed robbery in Harlan. You'd be
perfectly safe walking down our streets. You might not see much, but
you'd be safe.''
   Harlan remains coal country, and boys graduating from the choir
each receive a coal miner's hard hat. But the choir's inaugural
appearance has already drawn a different kind of attention to Harlan.
   Networks and filmmakers are doing reports and documentaries not
about union violence but about a group of disciplined boys who will
sing beneath five U.S. flags for the new president of the United
States.
   Said Allison: ``This is the most significant thing ever to happen
to Harlan, Ky.''

   A fire erupted in the tail of
a Boeing 737 as it taxied at Vancouver International Airport,
forcing 59 passengers and six crew members to make an emergency
exit, authorities said.
   There were no injuries in the evacuation Wednesday night.
   The Canadian Airlines International flight originated in Saint
John, New Brunswick, with stops in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Ottawa,
said airline spokeman Phil Ablitt.
   The fire started in the airliner's auxiliary power unit _ a small
jet engine in the tail of the plane used to power its air
conditioner and other systems while on the ground, he said.
   A warning system alerted the crew to a rise in the unit's exhaust
temperature and ``the tower also noticed there was smoke from the
exhaust area,'' Ablitt said.
   ``The crew discharged a fire extinguisher bottle into the area as
a precaution and carried out a passenger evacuation on the ramp,''
Ablitt said.
   The fire was contained within the power unit's fire shield and
the damage was minor, he said. The damaged unit will be taken apart
but Ablitt declined to speculate on the cause of the fire.
   In Seattle Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman David Jimenez
referred questions to the airline and said the incident ``has
nothing to do with us at the moment.''

   As every school kid must know by now, George
Bush will repeat a 35-word oath to become president of the United
States at noon Friday.
   As probably few school kids know, Dan Quayle will recite a
70-word oath to become vice president. Both oaths say substantially
the same thing, but the vice president is required by law to take
twice as long saying it.
   The difference would suggest that the framers of the second oath
might have been more suspicious or, at least, more nervous about new
vice presidents than new presidents. Thus, they spelled out
conditions in greater detail for the second man and insisted he
invoke God's help.
   In none of this could they have had Dan Quayle in mind. The
presidential oath was written 202 years ago in the Constitution. The
vice presidential oath comes in a law that evolved through several
congressional statues over more than 100 years.
   The president must say: ``I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I
will faithfully execute the office of president of the United
States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and
defend the Constitution of the United States.''
   The vice president, according to the inaugural committee, must
say: ``I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the
Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and
domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same;
that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion; that I will well and faithfully discharge the
duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.''
   Quayle should have no trouble with the wording. He has taken a
similar oath twice as senator.
   The careful reader will note that the vice president is more
circumscribed than the president. The president may affirm if he
doesn't choose to swear solemnly. (So far, only Franklin Pierce in
1853 chose to affirm.)
   The vice president has no choice. He has to swear solemnly or not
get the job, not legally.
   Nothing in the Constitution or subsequent law says the president
of the United States can't be an agnostic or atheist. He does not
have to say, ``So help me God.'' Most presidents since George
Washington have said that as a matter of custom or choice.
   The vice president is given no choice. He must say ``so help me
God'' or he risks unemployment. His oath doesn't even specify the
job he is promising to faithfully execute.
   But Congress took no chance and left him as little room as
possible. He must swear and forswear for the job that Harry Truman
thought was ``as useful as a cow's fifth teat'' and Alben Barkley
called ``a spare tire on the automobile of government.''

<HEAD>Occidental Reports Sabotage Attempt on Piper Alpha Rig</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. said
Thursday someone apparently tried to sabatoge the Piper Alpha oil
rig 10 months before an explosion and fire on the rig killed 167 men.
   A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles-based company told a panel
investigating the disaster that a small number of ball bearings were
found in a gas compressor that had been temporarily shut down. The
spokeswoman, Fiona McGhie, said the bearings were removed without
incident in September 1987.
   ``I wouldn't like to hazard a guess on the consequences (if the
ball bearings had not been found) other than there could have been a
serious incident,'' Ms. McGhie said on the first day of the inquiry
into the July 6, 1988 rig fire.
   The tiny metal balls were found in the same area of the
explosions that caused the fire, but ``there's no indication that
ball bearings were the cause of the disaster,'' she said.
   The Department of Energy already has said in a preliminary
technical report the disaster was not caused by sabotage but by a
buildup of gas following a leak in the gas compression module.
   The oil platform in the North Atlantic was rocked by a series of
explosions and incinerated by gas-fed fires. It was the world's
worst oil rig accident.
   Sixty-two men survived and the bodies of 136 were recovered. The
31 missing victims are believed caught in tons of debris in water
120 miles off the Scottish coast.
   Outside the inquiry center, several protesting relatives held up
a banner urging the government to ``Bring the Men Up Now!''
   ``I will demonstrate until they clear the sea of Piper Alpha,''
said Gavin Cleland, 60, whose 33-year-old son, Robert, was killed.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's administration ordered the
inquiry to establish the cause of the disaster and recommend ways of
preventing a recurrence. Lord Douglas Cullen is conducting the
inquiry with three expert assessors.
   Occidental Petroleum said platform managers investigated the
apparent sabotage incident but did not find a culprit. The
government was not informed until after the July disaster, and
details of the incident will be given to the inquiry, it said.
   The sabotage had been reported Wednesday night by a survivor,
John Wood.
   ``We all wondered if there was going to be a police inquiry into
it, but nothing more was ever said,'' Wood told Independent
Television News. ``So it's still a mystery to this day. It did worry
me at the time. I was living and working on this platform and
someone was trying to wreck it with me on it.''
   Occidental Petroleum plans to topple the 250-foot-high stump of
the shattered platform with explosives next month. It said the
wrecked platform endangers shipping, but relatives of missing men
oppose the destruction.
   Margo Gordon, whose husband, James, is missing, said: ``We have
got to stop Occidental blowing up or toppling that rig.
   ``I could understand and accept better if there were just one or
two bodies still missing. But 31 is a lot of men, too many to leave
it be and allow the families to be written off.''

   The Iraqi foreign minister said Thursday he
believes a U.N. envoy to visit the region next week will put
deadlocked peace talks with Iran back on track.
   Tariq Aziz, however, again accused Iran of blocking the
negotiations.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is sending Swedish
U.N. Ambassador Jan Eliasson to Tehran and Baghdad next week in a
bid to persuade the two sides to show more flexibility.
   ``They (the U.N. secretary general and his envoy) are bound to
put things in their correct place and make the Iranian side come to
the negotiations with a practical approach for durable and
comprehensive peace,'' Aziz said.
   Aziz said Eliasson would arrive in Iran on Monday and in Iraq on
Jan. 27. He said Eliasson will then consult with the U.N. secretary
general to fix a date for the talks to reopen.
   Almost eight years of war stopped Aug. 20, when both Iran and
Iraq accepted a U.N.-mediated cease-fire.
   However, three round of talks since then failed to break the
deadlock over troop withdrawals to pre-war borders.
   Aziz said Thursday that Iran's refusal to release sick and
wounded Iraqi prisoners of war is a major obstacle to peace.
   Iran and Iraq agreed in separate talks with the International
Committee for the Red Cross last November to exchange a total of
1,158 sick and disabled POWs.
   The exchange started Nov. 23 but broke down four days later after
the Iranians freed only half the agreed number. They said the rest
sought asylum in Iran.

   Relatives charged that the book's arguments ``rest on unsupported
assertions, erroneous suppositions, leaps of logic, and in some

   The rate of increase in consumer prices held
steady in 1988 at 4.4 percent, the government said Thursday, but
many economists are warning that inflation could accelarate
moderately this year.
   Although the rise in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index
last year was identical to the 1987 gain, the reasons were very
different.
   The summer drought pushed food prices up by 5.2 percent in 1988,
compared with 3.5 percent a year earlier. Last year's gain was the
steepest since 1980. Consumers got a break on energy costs, which
rose a scant 0.5 percent, compared with 8.2 percent in 1987.
   The inflation rate excluding the volatile food and energy
catagories _ a compilation many economists say is a better gauge of
underlying inflationary pressure than the larger index _ did
accelarate, from 4.2 percent in 1987 to 4.7 percent last year.
   ``The core inflation is ticking up,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, an
economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in
Chicago. ``I would not treat last year's number as something very
calming.''
   Nevertheless, 1988 ended on a moderate note, with 0.3 percent
increases in both November and December.
   Last month's advance left the price index at 120.5 percent of its
1982-84 base, meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing
$100 during the base period would have cost $120.50 in December, 20
cents more than in November.
   President Reagan, who will leave office Friday, has listed the
taming of inflation as one of his proudest accomplishments. During
his term, inflation hit a 25-year low of 1.1 percent in 1986.
   Under his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, the nation saw price
increases of 13.3 percent in 1979 and 12.5 percent in 1980.
   Many economists worry that the country may be in for a taste of
the bad old days this year. They say tight labor markets and rising
factory operating rates will inevitably lead to higher costs for
consumers. Many predict an inflation rate of 5 percent to 5.5
percent.
   ``What you see is no evidence of runaway inflation, the kinds of
problems we had in the late '70s and early '80s, but you see
pressure on prices building on a fundamental level,'' said William
Dunkelberg, dean of business at Temple University in Philadelphia.
   Unemployment in December matched a 14-year low while use of
factory capacity hit a nine-year high.
   Meanwhile, in other economic news, the Commerce Department said
housing construction fell 2.2 percent in December, the first decline
in four months. For the year, rising mortgage interest rates helped
to dampen construction activity, which fell 8.2 percent to 1.49
million units, the lowest rate since the recession year of 1982.
   The Labor Department also reported that Americans' average weekly
earnings, after adjusting for inflation, decreased 0.4 percent in
December after falling 0.5 percent a month earlier.
   Average weekly earnings last month were $329.81, 3.8 percent
higher than a year ago but still not high enough to keep up with
inflation.
   The department offered these details of inflation in 1988:
   _Hot weather pushed poultry and egg prices up 17.9 percent and
16.5 percent, respectively. On the other hand, beef and pork prices
fell or rose only slightly during the second half of the year as
farmers sent more animals to slaughter to reduce the need for feed
made more expensive by the drought. For the year, beef was up 5.6
percent; pork was down 3.1 percent. Fruit and vegatable prices rose
6.2 percent; cereals and baked goods, 8.4 percent, and dairy
products, 4.4 percent.
   _Fuel oil prices jumped 2.8 percent in December after falling for
six consecutive months. Despite the December advance, the price was
6.3 percent below that of a year earlier. Electricity charges rose
1.1 percent for the year, while natural gas was unchanged. Gasoline
prices were 1.1 percent lower than a year ago.
   _In other areas, housing costs rose 4.0 percent. Price increases
for new and used cars were a moderate 2.1 percent and 3.4 percent,
respectively. However, the costs of auto insurance and automoile
financing took steep jumps of 8.4 percent and 8.3 percent,
respectively.
   The cost of medical care, up 6.9 percent, also rose faster than
the general inflation rate last year. Tobacco prices posted one of
the steepest rises of any subcatagory, up 9.4 percent.
   Clothing prices rose 4.8 percent overall, with men's and boys'
apparel up 6.0 percent and women's and girls' clothing up 3.4
percent.
   The Federal Reserve Board, whose prime job as the nation's
central bank is to keep inflation under control, has been pushing
interest rates slowly but steadily higher since March in an effort
to slow the economy and ease inflationary pressures.
   ``In the end, I don't think inflation is going to move up all
that much (in 1989) because I think the Fed is going to remain very
vigilant,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.

   The condition of surrealist painter
Salvador Dali worsened Thursday after he developed pneumonia and an
inflamed lung, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Dali, who suffers from heart problems, was in critical condition
with a high fever, and X-rays showed he was getting worse by the
hour, said Dr. Carles Ponsati, his physician.
   ``We are not now so optimistic,'' he told Spanish National Radio.
``We believe complications will set in shortly.''
   The 84-year-old artist had gone from serious to critical
condition as a result of pneumonia that inflamed his left lung, said
a spokeswoman at Figueras Hospital who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Spanish news agency EFE said the artist's doctors had ruled
out transferring him from Figueras Hospital to Quiron Clinic in
Barcelona, about 60 miles away, because of his fragile condition.
   Ponsati said earlier Thursday that given the artist's advanced
age and his delicate health ``at any moment he could give us a
scare.''
   Dali was taken from his Galatea Tower residence in his hometown
to Figueras Hospital on Wednesday after Ponsati determined his heart
trouble had worsened.
   Dali has been hospitalized three times in the last two months for
heart problems.
   Doctors permitted Dali to return home from Figueras Hospital on
Dec. 25 after three days of treatment for an intestinal lesion.
   Before that, he spent 16 days in Barcelona's Quiron Clinic in
extremely critical condition due to severe heart trouble aggravated
by blood clots in his left lung before being released Dec. 14.
   Dali has been in poor health since August 1984 when he suffered
severe burns in a fire in the bedroom of Pubol Castle, his residence
at the time, in nearby La Pera. He was hospitalized for three months
after the fire.
   He received a pacemaker in 1986.
   The founding member of the surrealist movement is the last of an
outstanding generation of Spanish painters that included Pablo
Picasso, who died in 1973, and Joan Miro, who died a decade later.

   As soon as Ronald and Nancy Reagan exit the
White House Friday to escort George and Barbara Bush to the
inaugural ceremonies on Capitol Hill, the mansion's staff begins a
three-hour, behind-the-scenes race to transform the mansion into the
Bush's new home.
   President Reagan, at his last official function on Thursday,
joked about his impending move, telling an East Room luncheon group
to ``stick around. We're having a tag sale upstairs and everything
has to go.''
   And Bush poked fun at his wife this week for ordering him to
shoulder some of their packing crates and commanding him to ``move
this one over here.''
   But in reality, the outgoing and incoming first couples have
little to do with the shift. The mansion's domestic staff sees to it
that the personal belongings are switched during the swearing-in
ceremonies and inaugural address.
   ``When the president leaves the White House to go to Capitol Hill
(for the ceremony), this is still his home,'' James Allen, head
usher of the executive mansion, said in an interview. ``And when the
new president returns, it is then his home, with his things in
place.''
   Allen, who oversees the mansion and its 93-member staff,
described the frenetic shuffle as ``a very cut-and-dried job, that
has to be done in about three hours.''
   As their final social duty on Friday, the Reagans will treat the
Bushes, as well as Vice President-elect Dan Quayle and his wife
Marilyn, to a 10:30 a.m. coffee in the Blue Room of the executive
residence.
   The Reagans then depart the White House for the last time as the
nation's first couple. After Bush's swearing-in, they are slated to
travel by helicopter from Capitol Hill to Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington, from whence they will fly to Los Angeles.
   Until Friday, the Bushes stay at Blair House, the newly renovated
presidential guest quarters across the street from 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue.
   Allen said his job has been made easier this year because Mrs.
Reagan had most of the departing couple's furniture packed up and
sent in October to their California residence.
   The head usher said that since the Reagans have primarily only
clothing and some small personal items remaining in the house, the
mansion is nearly completely furnished and ready for the Bushes.
   ``They really only need to put their clothes in the drawers.'' he
said.
   When Mrs. Reagan removed her red upholstered furniture from the
second floor living room, other pieces were taken from the White
House supply held in a warehouse in Virginia and put in place, said
Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's press secretary.
   ``Believe me, the Bushes won't be sitting on orange crates _ Mrs.
Reagan has made every effort to find things in the White House
collection that they could be happy with from the moment they walk
in the door on Inauguration Day,'' Mrs. Crispen said.
   Last week, a visitor to the private quarters could see that the
elegant rooms were in perfect order, with some pale upholstered
furniture in place and the walls and tables adorned with artworks
and antique china pieces from the White House collections.
   Mrs. Bush, following a tour of the residence with Mrs. Reagan
last week, called herself ``very lucky. Nancy Reagan has set up such
a beautiful house that all I have to do is move in and say `ditto.'
... It was perfect.''
   Mrs. Bush said that besides their dog, Millie, their king-sized
bed and a few curtains, she intends to move in some of their living
room furniture. The staff will move the larger pieces of furniture
next week, said Mrs. Crispen.
   Allen said a supply of oil paintings and ``a collection of small
things'' like Boehm birds, vases and statues are available to help
decorate.
   ``It's adequate, but by no means complete,'' Allen said. ``Each
family brings their own touches with them to make it their home.''
   The Bush's sprawling seaside home in Kennebunkport, Maine, and
their vice presidential residence are full of family pictures as
well as Mrs. Bush's needlepoint treasures and furniture from their
stay in China, all expected to find their way to the White House.

   Heart disease patients who smoke are three times
more likely to have chest pains and restricted blood flow to their
hearts than those who don't light up, researchers say in a study
touted as the long-sought ``smoking gun.''
   The finding is the first direct evidence linking cigarettes and
heart disease, said an editorial accompanying the study in Friday's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The data indicated smokers were more likely than non-smokers to
have angina, or chest pains, and painless periods of inadequate
blood flow to the heart, both called ischemic episodes, the
researchers said.
   These episodes lasted longer among smokers, whose median episode
was 24 minutes compared to 2 minutes for non-smokers, the study
said. Both frequency and duration increased as the number of
cigarettes increased, the study said.
   Ischemic episodes damage the heart temporarily and can lead to
heart attacks, said Dr. Andrew Selwyn, a co-author of the report and
a cardiologist and associate professor at the Harvard Medical School.
   ``The more they smoke in general, the more ischemia they have and
the greater their risk of heart attack and death,'' Selwyn said.
   But the short-term effects are ``reversible and very treatable,
and that's what makes it (the study) useful to show to patients and
say `Look, you haven't damaged your heart yet, so stop smoking
now,''' Selwyn said in a telephone interview.
   ``This is a solid piece of evidence you can show patients before
they actually have a heart attack,'' he said.
   However, Gary Miller, a spokesman for the tobacco industry's
Washington-based Tobacco Institute, disputed that view.
   ``This is not really enough evidence to make such a claim,'' he
said in a telephone interview Thursday, noting the study involved
only two dozen smokers. Forty-one non-smokers also participated.
   ``Anything can cause these ischemic episodes. Caffeine,
excitement can cause them,'' Miller said.
   The JAMA editorial said research on smoking and heart disease
until now has been based on indirect evidence.
   What had been lacking was a ``smoking gun'' linking the two,
wrote Dr. Peter F. Cohn of the Health Sciences Center of the State
University of New York at Stony Brook.
   The study, based at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, was
conducted in 1984-87 by attaching a monitor to the hearts of 24
smokers and 41 non-smokers, all of whom had been diagnosed as having
heart disease.
   They wore the monitors for 24 hours while they went about their
daily routines.
   The monitors showed a total of 975 ischemic episodes, 8 percent
of which were accompanied by chest pains, the study said. The median
number of episodes over 24 hours was three for smokers and one for
non-smokers.
   ``What this did was show during the normal daily life the actual
activity of your heart,'' said Joan Barry, a researcher at Harvard
and another author of the study. ``Patients walk around and have
this abnormality and they're not even aware of it.''

<HEAD>State Department Cautiously Welcomes Soviets Arms Reduction Announcements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Thursday cautiously
welcomed Soviet arms reduction announcements and said the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization would modernize its nuclear weapons,
nonetheless.
   Spokesman Charles E. Redman also invited the Soviets to provide
more details on the announcements by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   The U.S. official said the Warsaw Pact has a numerical edge in
nuclear weapons in Europe and that assessing Soviet troop reductions
was difficult because Moscow does not reveal much about its defense
spending.
   Gorbachev told a group of Western visitors on Wednesday that
Soviet defense spending would be cut 14.2 percent and weapons
production by 19 percent.
   Shevardnadze, meanwhile, informed a human rights conference in
Vienna that the Soviets would withdraw some nuclear forces from
Eastern Europe and not modernize weapons remaining there.
   ``We welcome this announcement and look forward to receiving more
details on the Soviet plans,'' Redman said in response to the
foreign minister.
   He said NATO had withdrawn 2,400 nuclear weapons since 1969 and
that the Western alliance's nuclear arsenal was at its lowest level
in 20 years.
   ``To date, NATO's reductions have not been matched by the Soviet
Union,'' Redman said. ``We will follow with interest Soviet
implementation of this reduction.''
   The U.S. official then added that NATO would retain ``the minimum
number of nuclear weapons needed to maintain the strategy of
deterrence. Nothing has changed in that score.''
   Redman stressed the nuclear weapons would be kept ``up to date.''
He said: ``You don't want to send people into war without equipment
that works.''
   The statement clearly was intended to deflect any attempt by the
Soviets to stop the NATO modernization program or to spur the
elimination of all tactical nuclear weapons from Europe.
   The Reagan administration has tried to hold the line within the
alliance against disarmament tendencies. Some West Germans, for
instance, are intrigued by the prospect of East-West negotiations to
remove all nuclear missiles from their territory.
   All U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles _ with a
range of 300 to 3,000 miles _ are being scapped under a treaty
signed here in December 1987.
   Redman said, meanwhile, the administration was studying
Gorbachev's announcement of reductions in defense spending and
weapons production.
   ``We will be watching how these reductions are implemented,'' he
said.
   But, the U.S. official said, ``it's difficult at this stage to
assess the actual significance without knowing more about the
current Soviet defense outlays.'' And, Redman said, the Soviets have
acknowledged all that data is not made public.

   Benny O'Berry's side-by-side businesses in Miami's
Liberty City section survived the 1980 and 1982 riots unscathed. But
Tuesday night, one of them, a grocery operated by an Arab family for
a year, was looted and burned to the brick.
   ``There's no doubt about it. If they had known I still own the
building, they would have never torched it,'' said O'Berry, a black
businessman whose driving school next door was untouched. ``They
didn't realize it hurts me more than it hurts the Arabs.''
   As the dust settled in Liberty City and Overtown, shopkeepers in
the predominantly black neighborhoods shoveled up debris and counted
up their losses Thursday.
   Business owners and a black community activist said it was clear
black-owned businesses were spared and others specifically targeted
during three nights of rioting.
   While the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorcyclist by an
Hispanic police officer Monday set off the violence, deep-rooted
racial tension in these impoverished areas fueled the riots, those
in the community said Thursday.
   The rioters picked their targets carefully, they said, sometimes
even ransacking a store and destroying its cash registers and scales
but leaving behind large stocks of beer, wine and food.
   Sam Bahhur, whose Palestinian family operated seven small food
markets in Overtown and Liberty City, watched with anger as
customers streamed into the black-owned Dobson Grocery across the
street from his ransacked store.
   ``They were not hungry. They just wanted to destroy,'' he said
while his son used a shovel to clean up a heap of canned goods,
cookies and panty hose packages.
   ``We ran away from the uprising back home in Palestine, now we
find this. We ran away from persecution over there, and we end up
destroyed here. Where can a man run to?'' Bahhur asked.
   Six of the seven Bahhur stores were damaged, including the market
in O'Berry's building. That store was the only one on a block of
other businesses _ all black-owned _ to be hit by the rioting youths.
   Bahhur estimated the family's losses in inventory and store
fixtures, along with structural damage, at $3 million. The family
will rebuild if it can find the money, he said.
   City officials said overall structural damage from the rioting
was less than $1 million.
   Across the street, Thomas Dobson said his grocery was untouched
by rioters, not necessarily because he is black but because he
stayed to protect it every night.
   ``Did they avoid black businesses? That might have had some input
into it. Another thing may be the way they treat people when they go
in to stores,'' he said.
   Black community activist Georgia Ayers agreed with business
owners that the riots were more than just youths running wild.
   ``Everything was planned and targeted: Protect black businesses
and get the white man, the Hispanic and the Arab out of our
community,'' she said.
   For O'Berry, seeing destruction in his neighborhood of nearly 30
years is painful.
   ``I don't particularily think that solves the problem,'' he said.
``They thought they'd hurt the white and Arab businesses, but that
thinking process is wrong. It doesn't solve anything.''

   A drifter who opened fire with an assault
rifle on a crowded schoolyard, killing five children of Southeast
Asian refugees, hated Vietnamese immigrants and believed they were
robbing native-born Americans of jobs, a former co-worker said.
   But police said today that Patrick Edward Purdy, who wounded 30
others at Cleveland Elementary School before committing suicide
Tuesday, hated everyone.
   ``Through his lifetime, Mr. Purdy developed a hate for
everybody,'' said police Capt. Dennis Perry, who called the killer a
``loner (with) no friends, no particularly known girlfriends.''
   Purdy had ``a problem with alcohol, a problem with marijuana and
a distinct dislike for everybody _ not a particular race, all of
them,'' Perry said.
   Purdy was ``seething'' when he spoke about Vietnamese workers,
recalled former co-worker Steve Sloan.
   ``He said he hated Vietnamese,'' Sloan said in an interview in
today's editions of The Sacramento Bee.
   ``He seemed really frustrated ... because here he was, being
barely able to hold onto a job. I got the impression that the guy
had it in for other minority people because they're able to come
into our country,'' said Sloan, who said he spoke with Purdy at
Numeri Tech, a Stockton machine shop where the killer worked for a
few months early last year.
   The Bee also reported that Purdy tried to commit suicide in jail
in 1987 and was described in a subsequent mental health report as
``a danger to his health and others.''
   Purdy was carrying a book about the white supremicist group Aryan
Nations when he was arrested for firing a 9mm Browning semiautomatic
pistol at trees near Lake Tahoe in April 1987, the newspaper
reported.
   He told an El Dorado County Sheriff's deputy that it was his
``duty to help the suppressed and to overthrow the suppressor,''
according to arrest reports cited by the paper.
   Once in jail, Purdy made a rope out of strips of his shirt, tried
to hang himself but was discovered. He then tried to cut his wrists,
the newspaper said.
   In a subsequent mental health report, Purdy was described as
dangerous and suffering from ``mild mental retardation,'' the Bee
also reported. Authorities say Purdy had a long criminal record
   A woman who called herself Purdy's best friend said the killer,
whose clothes and guns bore radical Islamic slogans, was prone to
bleak moods ``where he didn't want to live.''
   ``He had a bizarre attitude, kind of paranoid,'' said Kelley
Riley, 25, described by residents as Purdy's frequent companion in
late 1987 and early 1988. ``he wanted to make it on his own (as a
welder) but he couldn't. He'd get upset at things. He'd get mad at
himself.''
   However, she said, Purdy was ``nice'' most of the time, would
``just walk away when he was mad,'' was never violent toward anyone
and never demonstrated an unusual interest in guns.
   Authorities concede they may never know why Purdy, wearing a flak
jacket, returned to the school of his youth.
   Purdy, who police said was either 24 or 26, parked his station
wagon behind the school and set it ablaze with a Molotov cocktail
before entering the campus during midday recess.
   After firing up to 110 shots from a bayonet-equipped,
Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifle at hundreds of youngsters, he
killed himself with a single pistol bullet to the head.
   A 6-year-old boy remained in serious condition and 17 pupils and
a teacher were in stable condition. The others wounded were treated
at hospitals or at the scene and were released.
   Officials said Purdy's olive-drab shirt bore the Iranian battle
cry, ``Death to the Great Satin'' (sic), ``PLO'' and the words
``Libya'' and ``Earthman.''
   Carved into the stock of the assault rifle was the word
``Hezbollah,'' the name of the radical Shiite Moslem faction
believed holding American hostages in Lebanon. Also carved into the
rifle were the words ``freedom'' and ``victory.''
   ``We still do not have a complete picture,'' Perry said. ``Why he
did this we may never know. We can only assume that some problem
came up in this guy that made him do it. Obviously, he had a
military hangup.''
   Psychologists urged parents to bring their children back to the
Cleveland Elementary School on Wednesday and deal with the trauma
immediately through counseling. The night before, workers washed the
blood from the pavement, patched the bullet holes and replaced
shattered windows.
   However, only 227 of the school's 975 pupils returned Wednesday,
said Principal Pat Busher.
   ``The kids are great and they are very resilient,'' she said.
   Parents and their children, most of them refugees from Southeast
Asia, were greeted by bouquets atop the school sign on the front
lawn and five red roses at its base. Across the street, a
3-by-9-foot paper sign read, ``Racists Are Ugly _ Let's Stop Them.''
   ``I still feel upset, but I have to bring my kid to see the
teacher to let the teacher know my kid's all right,'' Brom Lee said
in broken English. ``Everybody's angry. Your kid there, you get
angry, too.''
   His 7-year-old daughter, Nary, said she was scared to return
because ``I saw blood.''
   Holding tightly to her father's hand, she said she saw a
schoolmate felled by a bullet. ``I saw somebody get shot right
here,'' she said, pointing to her leg.
   The police captain said Purdy lived in a room at the El Rancho
Motel in the days leading up to the bloodbath. In the room, officers
found a bizarre collection of items, including a broken .22-caliber
rifle, about 100 plastic toy soldiers and an olive drab cloth on
which were drawn in black ``three snarling-type faces'' and the
words ``V for victory'' and ``F for freedom,'' Perry said.

   Riot police beat protesters with
clubs Thursday and formed human cordons to drive 2,000 people from
Wenceslas Square, where activists demanding more human rights have
rallied five straight days.
   More than a dozen protesters were beaten badly and at least 10
were dragged away by police during a melee that broke out after
authorities shouted through loudspeakers that the rally was
unauthorized.
   It was the most violent clash between protesters and police since
the gatherings began Sunday.
   The crowd had been chanting slogans demanding broader freedoms in
the communist-ruled nation, but those slogans changed to ``Gestapo!
Gestapo!'' when the baton-wielding wave of riot police swept
through, lashing out indiscriminately.
   Officers linked arms to form human chains and push the protesters
out of the square.
   Mayor Vdenek Horcik appealed for the ``provocations'' to stop. In
an address on national television, which appeared after the main
evening news, Horcik urged parents and teachers to keep young people
off the streets and said the police action was necessary to maintain
order.
   The crowd assembled shortly after 5 p.m., when many Prague
residents were on their way home after work. They shouted ``Free
Havel!'' and ``Let them go!'' referring to human rights activist
Vaclav Havel and 14 others jailed for taking part in earlier
protests.
   Hundreds of officers poured into the half-mile-long square from
sidestreets when the protesters refused to leave, charging the crowd
and pushing them along the boulevard.
   Police vans and ambulances with sirens blaring arrived to help
force away the demonstrators. Water cannons were brought onto the
square but not used.
   The demonstrations began Sunday when about 5,000 people gathered
at Wenceslas Square for a memorial to Jan Palach, who burned himself
to death 20 years ago to protest the presence of Soviet troops after
the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion.
   Troops and tanks sent in by the Kremlin in August 1968 crushed
the Prague Spring reforms, which now are likened to the social and
economic changes championed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Some protesters yelled ``Gorbachev sees this!'' when police moved
in Thursday.
   On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, police used water cannons, dogs,
truncheons and tear gas to break up rallies. About 5,000
demonstrators gathered again Wednesday night, but police did not
interfere.
   The more tolerant treatment was seen as the result of criticism
by Western officials attending a human rights conference in Vienna.
Czechoslovakia was one of 35 nations that agreed Sunday at the
meeting to a broad package of rights and freedoms, and its
leadership drew fire for breaking up Sunday's peaceful demonstration
within an hour of the accord's adoption.
   Members of the Charter 77 human rights group sent a letter
Thursday to Czechoslovakia's prime minister, Ladislav Adamec,
demanding that jailed dissidents be freed and officials be more
tolerant of public expression.
   Vaclav Maly of Charter 77 said fellow activist Martin Palous was
detained by police at his home around noon. Palous addressed
Wednesday's rally, reading a Charter 77 protest of the earlier
arrests.
   Maly also said a prosecutor informed activists that Havel,
Czechoslovakia's best-known dissident, faces hooliganism charges. He
said the crime carries a maximum two-year jail sentence.
   At least five other activists have been told they also will face
criminal charges for their roles in the demonstrations, Charter 77
members said.
   Communist authorities accused dissidents and the Western media of
fomenting the unrest.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said that on Wednesday
night, ``a cluster of about 1,000 people in the upper half of
Wenceslas Square made the usual everyday traffic impossible.''
   ``The purpose of this unauthorized gathering was also this time
evident from chanted slogans attacking the socialist system and its
leading representative,'' Rude Pravo said.
   In another development, former Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek, a
member Charter 77, was denied permission to visit West Germany for
the 75th birthday of his friend, former Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   Hajek, who was allowed to visit Austria last month, said Prague
authorities deemed it against state interests for him to travel
abroad.

<HEAD>Official Says Security Plans Being Reviewed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer specialists have begun reviewing
security plans covering thousands of computer systems handling
sensitive data throughout the federal government, a government
official said Thursday.
   Douglas Hunt, of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, said that ``I think the review activity is moving very
well. We're very optimistic.''
   Hunt said scrutiny of the plans, being carried out by a joint
team of specialists from the institute and the Pentagon's National
Security Agency, had started Tuesday.
   ``We're still receiving some plans. Most of them have come in _
most of the agencies have sent their submissions. And we are
proceeding with the review,'' he said.
   Hunt said he did not yet have a count of the specific number of
computer security plans submitted so far, but said it was ``in the
thousands.''
   Drafting, review and implementation of new security plans for
computers handling sensitive but unclassified data were among steps
_ including improved training programs for computer users _ mandated
under the Computer Security Act signed into law last year by
President Reagan.
   The legislation came in the wake of increased concern over
vulnerability of government computer systems to so-called computer
viruses and other threats.
   In a report released last September, the General Accounting
Office, an arm of Congress, said federal agencies at that time had
identified 53,443 computer systems _ an estimated 52,000 of them
within the Defense Department _ containing sensitive data.
   However, Hunt said he did not expect the number of security plans
submitted for review to reach that high because agencies are being
permitted to group together similar computer systems under a single
plan.
   He said the team reviewing the plans now includes 16 specialists
and was expected to peak this spring at about 30 people. The
institute is spending about $1.5 million on the effort, he said.
   ``We are planning on completing the review at the latest by the
end of May. Then we will be wrapping up with a final report,
summaries and stuff in June,'' Hunt said.

<HEAD>Opponents of U.S. Bases Face Off With U.S. Supporters, Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By YASMIN ARQUIZA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANGELES, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 people protesting the
U.S. military presence in the Philippines marched toward the gates
of Clark Air Base on Thursday, but riot police and thousands of
residents blocked their way.
   About 2,000 residents massed at the main gate of the U.S. base
hours before the protesters, who oppose nuclear weapons they say are
kept by U.S. forces, arrived from Manila.
   Scantily clad bar girls danced and chanted or waved signs with
slogans directed at opponents of the bases. Some of the signs read:
``Leave us alone,'' ``U.S. bases yes, pullout no,'' and ``We love
our job. Retain the bases.''
   Most of the 200,000 residents of Angeles depend for their
livelihood on income from the base, primarily on spending by its
26,000 U.S. personnel and dependents.
   The anti-U.S. demonstrators were blocked by dozens of jeeps left
by police and local residents about 300 yards from the base. About
1,000 riot police manned a bigger barricade of trucks about 100
yards from the main entrance.
   Police said they set up the barricades to keep apart the two
rival groups after receiving reports that local residents and
right-wing extremists planned to disrupt the anti-U.S. rally.
   After two hours of negotiations, police allowed base opponents to
march to a park about 100 yards from the base for an overnight
rally. The group was to travel to the U.S. navy base at Subic Bay 30
miles to the southwest for a similar rally Friday.
   While base opponents were en route from Manila on Thursday, armed
soldiers searched each of the more than 150 vehicles at three
checkpoints. One officer said the troops were ordered to search for
weapons and right-wing elements who might have joined the group to
create trouble.
   ``This is plain and simple harassment,'' said Philippine Rep.
Gregorio Andolana, who was taking part in the anti-U.S. protest.
Opposition to the bases runs strong both in the population and in
Congress.
   The Senate must approve any extension of the lease agreement for
the six U.S. installations. The pact expires in 1991.
   Also Thursday, communist rebels warned they were ready to launch
new attacks on U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
   A regional branch of the National Democratic Front, a Marxist
umbrella group, said in a statement that rebel forces ``are in a
position to launch action _ armed and unarmed, legal and illegal _
directly aimed at the U.S. bases.''
   In October 1987, rebels mounted simultaneous ambushes outside
Clark, killing three U.S. servicemen and a Filipino.

   Voters in this British colony will go to
the polls in Feburary for the first time in more than three years,
Premier John Swan announced Thursday in a call for early general
elections.
   He set the Feb. 9 election date after weeks of speculation that
he wanted to extend the term he first won in 1983.
   In the last general election in 1985, Swan's governing United
Bermuda Party took 31 of 40 seats in the Assembly, the party's
largest majority ever.
   The government's support has eroded as a result of several recent
problems, including overspending on work at Bermuda's airport and a
controversial plan to build a trash-burning plant.
   Swan could wait until 1990 to schedule elections, but the premier
apparently believes he would have a better chance of winning if they
are called quickly.

   A Soviet icebreaker dispatched to rescue North Pole
researchers from a drifting ice floe north of Greenland failed to
cut its way through to them, leaving the scientists stranded, Tass
reported Thursday.
   The icebreaker Rossiya will try again, bypassing the
``impregnable wall of ice'' and circling around to attempt a
breakthrough from the north, Tass said, quoting a report from the
ship radioed to the northern Soviet port of Murmansk.
   The rescue operation was mounted after the ice floe under Soviet
research station North Pole-28 was caught in a warm current and
began drifting southward and thawing, according to the official news
agency.
   Tass said the floe could no longer accommodate a rescue plane, so
the Rossiya was sent Sunday to try to pick up the researchers. Tass
did not say how many scientists were at the station or when the
Rossiya would make its next attempt to reach them.
   Tass indicated that authorities had decided to abandon the
drifting station, which it said had been conducting research in a
poorly explored area north of Greenland.
   ``It was decided that the Otto Shmidt research ship will later
subsitute for the North Pole-28 station,'' Tass said. ``With the
help of an icebreaker, the vessel will be frozen into the ice and
will then drift with it for several months.''

<HEAD>Curbs on US Oil Firms in Libya Eased</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan authorized American oil
companies on Thursday to resume doing business in Libya in a bid to
head off the potential nationalization of their huge investment in
that country.
   The move also is designed to put an end to what a White House
statement called the ``significant windfall profits'' Libya has
reaped since the administration imposed the ban on the U.S.
operations there in 1986.
   In the absence of the American firms, Libyans have been working
the U.S. oil fields and keeping the income.
   The White House and the State Department both said that Reagan's
decision does not constitute any softening of U.S. sanctions against
Libya.
   These include a trade embargo and a freeze on Libyan assets in
the United States. State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
these restrictions will prevent the oil companies from sending any
goods between the United States and Libya.
   The announcement, which came on Reagan's last full day in office,
seemed designed to spare the Bush administration a similar decision.
   If the announcement had been left to the incoming administration,
it could have left the impression among some that President-elect
Bush and Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III were
showing favoritism toward oil interests. Both had been involved in
that business in Texas.
   Asked whether the timing of the announcement was politically
motivated, Redman said only that the review of U.S. policy had been
under way since last summer.
   The companies affected are Occidential Petroleum, Marathon Oil,
Conoco Petroleum, W. R. Grace and Amerada Hess. Their investments in
Libya are believed to total in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Before the embargo went into effect, Libya received 51 percent of
the revenues derived from the U.S. oil operations.
   When the administration imposed broad trade sanctions against
Libya in 1986, it authorized the companies to negotiate
``standstill'' agreements with Libya.
   The agreements, which expire on June 30, provided for the
suspension of company operations to protect the firms from charges
of default on their contractual obligations to work their
concessions in Libya.
   The companies have been concerned that Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi might seize their assets if the agreement expires and the
sanctions are not lifted.
   ``This decision does not represent a change in the attitude of
the U.S. government toward Libya,'' Redman said. ``Our view remains
unaltered. Libya still supports terrorism and subversion.
   ``It continues to act against the United States and the West. The
chemical weapons factory it has built constitutes a regional menace
and no improvement in U.S. relations can be possible without
concrete and durable change in Libya's behavior.''
   In a similar vein, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``We remain deeply concerned about Gadhafi's continued support for
terrorism and subversion as well as Libyan efforts to develop a
chemical weapons capability.''
   Redman said the announcement will permit the oil companies to
resume their operations in Libya, transfer operations to foreign
subsidiaries or sell their assets if they so desire.
   With a trade embargo and strict restraints on travel by Americans
to Libya in effect, Redman said the U.S. firms could use third
country nationals and third country goods in their Libyan operations.

<HEAD>New Genetic Findings Allow Early Detection of `Elephant Man's Disease'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have discovered genetic signposts that
will allow diagnosis of Elephant Man's disease before symptoms
appear and even before birth, a foundation that deals with the
disorder announced Thursday.
   That will allow earlier treatment to reduce severity of the
disease, a hereditary disorder that afflicts at least 100,000
Americans, authorities said.
   Doctors also will be able to rule out the disease early, bringing
relief to a family.
   ``It's going to usher in a new era in us being able to provide
services of various types for people with this disorder,'' said
Allan Rubenstein, medical director of the National Neurofibromatosis
Foundation.
   The disease, called neurofibromatosis 1, strikes in about one in
every 4,000 live births.
   The illness causes tumors to grow anywhere in the nervous system
and can lead to severe disfigurement, deafness, blindness, brain
cancer and spinal deformity. Some 40 percent to 60 percent of
patients also suffer learning disabilities.
   The disease gained its nickname from a disfigured 19th-century
Englishman who exhibited himself at sideshows as the Elephant Man.
But since then, researchers have determined he actually had a
different disease.
   Early signs of the disease often are noticed shortly after birth.
But in about a quarter of all cases, a diagnosis cannot be confirmed
until adolescence, when other symptoms appear, said Rubenstein.
   In addition, he said, about 10 percent of neurofibromatosis cases
lack classic symptoms, so that no definite diagnosis can be made.
That poses a problem as a person approaches childbearing years and
wants to know if he or she carries the faulty gene, which can be
passed on to a child, Rubenstein said.
   While prenatal diagnosis allows the possibility of an abortion,
most people with neurofibromatosis live a normal life without
serious medical problems, said John Carey, associate professor of
pediatrics at the University of Utah.
   About half of neurofibromatosis cases come from inheriting the
faulty gene, while the other half occur spontaneously. Testing based
on the new discovery will be possible only in families in which the
disease has already appeared.
   Researchers followed up on a 1987 discovery that the gene causing
the disorder lay somewhere within a portion of chromosome 17, one of
the 23 versions of thread-like structures that carry human
hereditary information.
   The new work narrows down the location of the gene to about 5
percent of the chromosome. The genetic signposts, called markers,
lie close to the gene on each side.
   The markers are valuable because they tend to be inherited along
with the gene. So if they are found on a person's chromosome 17, he
has a high probability of carrying the neurofibromatosis gene.
   The markers will be useful in an estimated 80 percent to 90
percent of families that have had a case of neurofibromatosis,
Rubenstein said. In those families, the markers should enable early
diagnosis with at least 95 percent accuracy, he said.
   Once the gene itself is isolated, a more general screening test
will be possible, researchers say.
   The findings are reported in the January issue of The American
Journal of Human Genetics by a consortium of researchers, led by
Francis Collins of the University of Michigan, Bernd Seizinger of
Harvard Medical School and Bruce Ponder of Royal Marsden Hospital in
England.

   Some inauguration celebrants have had their
ball gowns delivered by Federal Express. Others simply must have the
perfect table at the perfect time. And there's always the worry
about what to do between events.
   Welcome to inaugural week in Washington, where high-roller
Republicans _ and parties for them _ are aplenty.
   ``I guess we'll be going to some parties here,'' San Francisco
banking executive Don Stephens said calmy upon arriving in the
capital, an understatement in a week overflowing with festivities.
   By Thursday, those with energy as well as money were well into
party mode.
   ``After the opening ceremony we're going to eat and then to a New
Jersey reception, but we'll see you tonight at Union Station or back
at the hotel afterward,'' one mink-draped woman told another
Wednesday in a conversation overheard in a hotel lobby, where the
well-heeled are easy to find these days.
   They also can be found in the choice seats at inaugural events,
or the choice restaurants, or the choice clothing stores _ which
report high demand for formal gowns from those who didn't bring
enough and can't be seen in the same one twice.
   ``I called home and had my daughter send me this because I looked
at the schedule and realized I needed another one,'' said a woman
who got Federal Express involved in the overnight gown-delivery
business. ``Oh, God, no, I'd be too embarrassed,'' she said when
asked her name, confessing only that home was California and her
next stop was the hotel's valet desk to inquire about having the
gown pressed.
   Keeping high rollers happy is a top priority of the Republican
National Committee, which is trying to take care f those who
bankrolled the 1988 campaign.
   The RNC held a dinner-dance Tuesday night for its leaders and top
contributors, welcoming them to Washington a night before the formal
inaugural events began.
   Since then, the celebration has been virtually non-stop for, in
the words of one GOP fund-raiser, ``those of us who paid so
generously in advance.''
   There was the kickoff ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial and the
first round of dinners Wednesday, and another full day of events
Thursday, including a salute to the new first lady, Barbara Bush,
and vice president, Dan Quayle, and a star-studded gala to be
attended by President-elect Bsuh, as well as his wealthy supporters.
   The RNC also has arranged a number of private receptions to keep
its favorite guests entertained between official inaugural events,
and many are organizing smaller dinner parties and private
receptions.
   The Ritz-Carlton ordered 5,000 ounces of choice caviar to please
the palates of its guests this week.
   And when the affluent eat out, they expect royal treatment.
   ``You have to use your intuition, your imagination,'' said maitre
d' Martin Garbisu of the Ritz's exclusive Jockey Club. ``You don't
want to create bad feelings.''
   Cosmetics queen Estee Lauder and Wall Street takeover king Henry
Kravis were among this week's visitors to the Jockey Club, where the
most frequent request has been for a table in the front section _
the most visible. ``People will do anything,'' said Garbisu, smiling
as his voice trailed off.
   There have been a few glitches amid the glamor.
   Limousines are scarcer than scarce, guests had to scramble for
unassigned seats despite paying $1,500 a plate for dinner Wednesday
night, and tickets to some of the high-profile events are
nonexistent, even for high rollers with invitations.
   Indeed, a special ``trouble room'' at the Washington Convention
Center for those with ticket problems was packed with grumbling
Republicans on Thursday.
   ``They don't like lines and they especially don't like standing
in line only to be told `Sorry,''' one inaugural organizer said.
``These are people who are treated like kings in their home states.
But we've got a lot of people to look out for here and not all of
them are too happy right now.''

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia chose a new premier
Thursday who believes a combination of market-oriented reform and
political change is the answer to the economic and social crisis.
   The collective presidency's choice of Ante Markovic was a clear
victory for liberal, refomist elements of the ruling Communist Party
over the consaervative, dogmatic faction.
   It also was seen as a rebuke to Slobodan Milosevic, Communist
Party chief of Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, who had put up
a Serbian candidate in competition.
   Markovic, whose appointment must be approved by Parliament, is a
64-year-old electrical engineer and member of the national party's
policy-making Central Committee.
   The nine-member presidency told Markovic to start forming a
Cabinet ``as soon as possible,'' the official news agency Tanjug
reported.
   He will succeed Branko Mikulic, whose government resigned Dec. 30
because it could not solve such economic problems as high
unemployment, annual inflation of 250 percent, and a $21 billion
foreign debt.
   A decline in the living standard to half what it was when
President Tito died in 1980 has caused widespread discontent among
workers. A record 1,400 strikes were reported last year.
   Mikulic's was the first national government to step down since
Tito and the Communists gained power after World War II.
   Tanjug did not give a vote count among the nine members of the
presidency in the contest between Mikulic and Serbian candidate
Borisav Jovic, a close associate of Milosevic.
   The new premier has long advocated simultaneous economic and
political reform in Yugoslavia, a federation of six diverse
republics. He had the strong support of Croatia and Slovenia, the
most economically advanced and Westward-looking regions.
   Reforms Mikulic initiated late last year, which Markovic is
expected to implement, allow more investment of domestic and foreign
private capital, sale of stocks and bonds and changes in the banking
system along Western lines.
   Jovic, an economist and speaker of the Serbian parliament, had
support from poorer regions that fear economic reform could lead to
closure of money-losing industries and mass layoffs of workers.
   Serbia had said the job should go to its candidate because there
had not been a Serbian premier in 22 years.
   Milosevic appeared defiant Thursday when he spoke at a party
conference in the province of Vojvodina, defending recent mass
rallies in Serbia widely believed to have been organized by his own
supporters.
   The protests strained the nation's fragile ethnic balance for six
months and led to the ouster of many opponents of the Serbian party
chief.
   During the party meeting Thursday, broadcast live on television,
Milosevic said no solution to the national difficulties was possible
without the political ``liquidation ... of those who have created
the crisis.''

<HEAD>Defense Blames Nussbaum At Steinberg's Murder Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hedda Nussbaum, former live-in lover of murder
defendant Joel Steinberg, killed their adopted daughter herself
because she saw the girl as a rival for his attention, defense
attorneys charged Thursday.
   Ms. Nussbaum ``didn't care about the kid a bit, not one bit,''
Adrian DiLuzio said in closing arguments, calling her ``a poor
excuse for a woman and a mother.''
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, was the key witness against Steinberg. The
47-year-old disbarred lawyer is charged with murder in the beating
death of 6-year-old Lisa Steinberg, whom he illegally obtained at
birth from an unwed teen-ager.
   The child was removed unconscious from Steinberg's Greenwich
Village apartment in 1987 and died of a brain injury three days
later.
   The defense charged that it was Ms. Nussbaum who inflicted the
fatal injuries during a fight with the girl while Steinberg was out
to dinner.
   ``Lisa Steinberg was a rival. Lisa got all the attention she
(Nussbaum) thought she should have been getting,'' DiLuzio said. He
recalled testimony that Ms. Nussbaum thought Steinberg was a ``god.''
   ``If someone's stealing your god, you kill them, and you kill
them without remorse, vindictively,'' he said. ``Nor would you ever
have a sense of guilt about what you did.''
   Charges against Ms. Nussbaum were dropped and she was granted
immunity from prosecution for her testimony against Steinberg. She
said she was battered by Steinberg and she has spent nearly the past
year in a psychiatric facility.
   Another defense attorney, Ira London, said Ms. Nussbaum's
hospitalization was an attempt to win jury sympathy and avoid
prosecution.
   ``She was also granted an opportunity to get revenge against Joel
by being appointed his accuser,'' he said.
   The prosecution says Steinberg hit the girl then let her lie
unconscious for 12 hours without seeking help for her. Steinberg
denies ever hitting the child.
   Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro was expected to give
his closing arguments on Friday.

   President Reagan said Thursday he was
frustrated over his inability to free Americans held hostage in
Lebanon and conceded, a day before leaving office, ``We don't know
where they are.''
   Even to the end of his presidency, Reagan said, officials were
continuing to explore ``quietly and privately'' how to win freedom
for the nine Americans. ``There hasn't been a moment that this isn't
on our minds,'' he said.
   ``We know that any overt attempt at rescue, even if we did have a
hint or a clue (about their whereabouts), could run the risk of
their assassination or execution before we could get them out,'' he
told reporters for The Associated Press and other news services.
   Reagan also said in the wide-ranging interview that:
   _He contines to believe U.S. arms sales to Iranian elements in
1985 and 1986 did not constitute an attempt to trade arms for the
hostages, held by pro-Iranian Lebanese kidnappers. Viewing the sale
as an attempted swap amounted, he said, to ``a total media
distortion.''
   _He stil feels former White House aides Oliver L. North and John
M. Poindexter will be found innocent of criminal wrongdoing in
connection with the arms deal. He seemed to rule out granting
pardons for either man before leaving office at noon Friday, saying
that to do so would ``leave them forever after with that guilt
hanging over them.''
   _He has high confidence in George Bush's ability to handle
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   As to the hostages, Reagan said their situation did not parallel
that of the 52 Americans freed from captivity the day he took
office, Jan. 20, 1981, after 444 days as prisoners in Iran.
   During the 1980 campaign against Jimmy Carter, Reagan criticized
the president for being unable to win their release.
   Reagan had criticized Carter's handling of the hostage-taking at
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran as ``too sluggish'' and had said on Jan.
7, 1980:
   ``I believe it's appropriate to suggest that anything that has
been done by the administration so far, could have, should have,
been done in the first hour.''
   In Thursday's interview, Reagan declined to take back the
criticism.
   ``We were facing two very different situations,'' he said, noting
that in the earlier situation, more than 50 people had been taken
prisoner in the embassy and had been kidnapped by the government of
Iran.
   On the other hand, he said, the Americans held in Lebanon were
kidnapped individually by terrorists.
   Nine Americans are prisoners. Associated Press chief Middle East
correspondent Terry Anderson has held the longest, since March 16,
1985.
   On the question of U.S. dealings with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, Reagan said he thought Bush would move forward on the
issue of reducing the superpower stockpiles of long-range nuclear
weapons, but that caution should be used.
   ``I think we have to realize that in these negotiations ...
they're not just based on what someone says. They're based on deeds.
And I think that George (Bush) will be very prepared there, based on
what the deeds are.''
   Reagan said he does not believe he is less popular in Europe than
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, as some polls have said.
   ``I can't quite accept that he's more popular than I am,'' Reagan
said.

   It was two years ago Friday that Anglican
Church emissary Terry Waite left his Beirut hotel to negotiate the
release of American hostages and disappeared, presumably becoming a
hostage himself.
   What happened on his fifth mercy mission remains a mystery, but
other Western hostages freed since he vanished have reported seeing
a man in an underground prison they believed was the 6-foot-7 Waite.
   New rumors crop up almost every week: He was killed trying to
escape Shiite Moslem extremists who held him; he was smuggled to
Iran in a coffin to stand trial as an American spy; he will be
ransomed for $7 million.
   No group has claimed to hold Waite. The British government, which
refuses to negotiate with terrorists, says no demands have been
made. No photographs or videotapes have been released to prove he is
alive.
   A British official said recently: ``We believe Waite is alive
simply because we've had no evidence to the contrary.''
   Fifteen foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including nine
Americans, most of them believed held by Shiites loyal to Iran.
   One of the Americans, on whose behalf Waite had intended to
negotiate, has been held longest: Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   The 49-year-old personal envoy of the archbishop of Canterbury is
one of four Britons among the missing. Two seen grabbed by gunmen in
Beirut _ journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, who has
British and Irish nationality _ also disappeared with no claims of
abduction.
   Iran's recent effort to improve relations with Britain and other
Western nations after a decade of self-imposed isolation has raised
hopes it will seek to have the hostages freed.
   Waite's cousin, John Waite, said Wednesday in a CBS-TV interview:
``What we're hoping is that President Bush ... can put the hostage
question right to the top of his agenda.''
   President-elect George Bush, who takes office Friday, said this
week he does not believe Iran controls the Lebanese kidnap gangs but
believes improved relations could help. Bush said his administration
would seek ways to free the hostages.
   President Reagan acknowledged Thursday that he leaves office
``without a hint or a clue'' about the American hostages.
   Sources in the Middle East who have been well-informed on earlier
hostage releases report no significant movement toward more releases
soon.
   Waite, the policeman's son who became the personal emissary of
Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, was seen leaving the seaside
Riviera Hotel in Moslem west Beirut at 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 20, 1987,
to meet with Shiite kidnappers.
   He told his Druse bodyguards he did not want them to escort him
to the clandestine meeting, whose site he did not disclose.
   Sources said Waite was driven to the home of a Shiite physician
who acted as middleman, where he apparently was to make contact with
Islamic Jihad, a Shiite faction holding Anderson and Thomas
Sutherland, another American captive.
   According to the sources, it was in the physician's house that
the fate he often feared became reality: Waite himself was taken
hostage.
   Walid Jumblatt, leader of the the Druse militia guarding Waite,
accused the Hezbollah, or Party of God, of holding Waite but the
Shiite fundamentalist group denied it.
   On Thursday, he appealed for Waite's release in an interview
broadcast by Lebanon's state television.
   ``I do not think that Terry Waite is that big a spy. We should
emerge from this whirlpool (of hostage taking),'' he said without
elaborating.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella organization for Shiite
kidnappers, including Islamic Jihad, whose name means Islamic Holy
War.
   Lebanese officials and some Western sources believe Waite's
position was compromised by disclosure of the Reagan
administration's arms-for-hostages deal with Tehran.
   Three American captives held by Islamic Jihad were freed after
U.S. weapons were delivered to Iran in 1985-86 during its war with
Iraq. Until the U.S. dealings with Tehran were disclosed in November
1986, Waite was credited with obtaining their freedom.
   Other reports say Islamic Jihad decided to make Waite a captive
because it held him responsible for Kuwait's refusal to free 17
pro-Iranians imprisoned there for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies and other targets in 1983. Their freedom had been the
group's main demand.

   George Bush, on the eve of his inauguration as
the nation's 41st president, said today he would use his address on
Friday to urge Americans ``to pitch in and help.''
   He also spoke of his optimism about the future but also expressed
his feeling that President Reagan's ``shoes are going to be pretty
darn hard to fill.''
   Bush told a group of top high school students his mission was
``to help build a better America,'' and he asked for their help.
   The president-elect, who was to spend most of the day out of the
public eye until his appearance at a nationally televised evening
gala, said at a youth inaugural forum, ``I really feel this: Our
best days are yet to come.''
   In a mid-day interview with news service reporters, he said his
inaugural address on Friday would include ``a broad appeal to the
American people to pitch in and help. It will be an expression of
satisfaction about how far we've come as a nation, and a recognition
that we've got a long way to go.''
   He said the speech would be ``broad and thematic'' and not
contain many specifics.
   Bush said in the interview that he had no plans for a ``first 100
Days'' initiative with Congress, calling that ``a concept that
really doesn't apply'' to a vice president stepping up to the top
job.
   He also was to bid a private farewell today to the man who he
said helped make it all possible.
   ``It won't be too easy,'' Bush said of what could be his final
private moment with Reagan before taking the oath of office.
   Reagan himself said today that he is leaving office ``without a
hint or a clue'' as to the whereabouts of Americans held hostage in
Lebanon.
   In a farewell interview with news service reporters, Reagan said
that while he feels badly about the hostages, the situation should
not be likened to the one when he came to office eight years ago.
Fifty-two Americans held in Tehran were released on Jan. 20, 1981 _
the same day that Reagan was inaugurated and President Carter left.
Reagan had harshly criticized Carter during the 1980 campaign for
failing to win the hostages' release.
   This week, the focus of the nation's leadership was already
beginning to shift to Bush, as he headlined events leading up to the
Friday ceremony.
   Some of his time today was to be spent rehearsing his 15-minute
inaugural address, spokeswoman Alixe Glen said.
   Meanwhile, Barbara Bush, the president-elect's wife, won cheers
and laughter today from audiences that packed three theater halls to
hear her joke about her appearance and her husband's fishing.
   Mrs. Bush stepped out from behind one podium and told her
audience, ``Please notice _ hairdo, makeup, designer dress. ... Look
at me good this week. And remember. You may never see it again.''
   She also made fun of her husband's comments on how tough it has
been for him to pack for the move to the White House. Noting he
spent two days fishing last week in Florida, Mrs. Bush said, ``So
much to the packing story.''
   The students Bush addressed today cheered when he said, ``Our
American optimism about the future is legendary and perhaps no one
better personifies that than a president named Ronald Reagan, whose
shoes are going to be pretty darn hard to fill.''
   ``I can't predict all the twists and the turns that you'll see in
your lives, nor can I as president prepare you for them, but this I
do pledge: that I will do all in my power to help you to help
yourselves prepare for a brighter future,'' Bush said.
   He joked that, ``I certainly learned the importance of education
during the campaign. I learned how vital it is to memorize dates _
Pearl Harbor Day, for example.''
   It was a reference to Bush's campaign gaffe in which he told an
American Legion audience that the anniversary of the Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor was Sept. 7. He quickly corrected himself to the
actual day, Dec. 7.
   He made a new mix-up today, promising his inaugural speech
wouldn't be too long and recalling that one president _ Benjamin
Harrison, he said _ died from pneumonia after giving a very lengthy
inaugural speech in bitterly cold weather. Actually, that president
was William Henry Harrison.
   A twilight inaugural extravaganza at the stately Lincoln Memorial
on Wednesday was marked by a flyover of Navy jets, a massive
fireworks display and music by the Beach Boys and other groups. Many
in the crowd waved penlights handed out for the event to represent
Bush's campaign theme of ``a thousand points of light.''
   Bush tried to stress his commitment to social justice during
several appearances Wednesday, as hundreds of homeless people
protested outside the lavish banquets held for Republican boosters.
Protesters outside one banquet at Union Station chanted ``Feed the
poor, not the rich.''
   ``America is strong once again, but the job is not complete,''
Bush said at the Lincoln Memorial. ``Some are still hurting. And we
care.''
   Reagan and his tearful wife Nancy, meanwhile, bade a somber
farewell to hundreds of White House staffers. ``We were all
revolutionaries, and the revolution has been a success,'' Reagan
told the gathering of aides.
   Bush moved on Wednesday to the Blair House, the historic
government guest house across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White
House. He was to spend two nights there.
   And, like any other person changing jobs and homes, Bush griped
about moving.
   Apologizing for Barbara Bush's absence from the RNC luncheon, the
president-elect quipped: ``She's getting tough around the house. See
a half-filled crate and she puts me to work.''

<HEAD>Government Says Libya May Be Planning Biological Weapons Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Thursday said it had
indications Libya may be planning to conduct research into
biological weapons at a planned institute for microbiology.
   The chief government spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, made the
announcement late Thursday but said there was no evidence to confirm
it. He also said there was no evidence West Germans were linked to
the planned institute.
   The location of the proposed institute was not given.
   ``There are indications that Libya could also be intending to
carry out biological weapons research there,'' Ost said. He did not
elaborate.
   Earlier Thursday, a leading member of Parliament called for an
investigation of a report that West Germans, East Germans and Cubans
were involved in operation of a biological weapons plant in Iraq.
   Ost confirmed the government had received information such a
plant may be operating in Iraq but said there was ``no immediate
indication'' West German technicians or scientists were involved.
   Wilfried Penner, a member of the Parliamentary Control Commission
for Intelligence Services, said he called for a meeting of the
commission to investigate a television news report linking Cuba,
West Germany and East Germany with the suspected Iraqi plant.
   The report on RTL-Plus television Wednesday came as controversy
continued over the suspected involvement of West German companies in
helping Libya build a disputed facility outside its capital, Tripoli.
   Libya says the plant will produce pharmaceuticals, but U.S.
officials say it is intended to produce chemical weapons.
   Penner, of the main opposition Social Democratic Party, told The
Associated Press he called for the meeting only in part because of
the RTL-Plus television report.
   The RTL-Plus report broadcast from Luxembourg said: ``Scientists
and technicians from the Federal Republic (West Germany) have
constructed a factory for biological weapons in Iraq.''
   The report said the plant is at Salman Fag, 30 miles southeast of
Bagdad. It said West German scientists and bacteriologists from East
Germany and Cuba were involved and that ``the plant produces weapons
that can spread deadly cholera, anthrax, and typhoid.''
   According to the TV report, bacteria for the biological weapons
are produced in secret underground laboratories protected by
Soviet-built missiles.
   Intelligence sources believe that rockets for delivery of the
biological weapons were built by German technicians, the report said.
   In Frankfurt, prosecutor Jochen Schroers said he was not aware of
the report.
   Schroers' office is investigating the now-defunct I.B.I.
Engineering company, owned by Iraqi businessman Ihsan Barbouti, to
determine if it was involved in helping build the disputed Libyan
plant.
   The Imhausen-Chemie firm, based in Lahr, West Germany, also is
under investigation in connection with alleged involvement with the
Libyan plant. Imhausen allegedly played a key role in supplying
material and know-how for the facility.

<HEAD>Navy Suspends 2 Consultants in Continuing Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy on Thursday suspended two private
consultants and their companies from receiving or working on new
federal contracts in connection with an on-going probe of Pentagon
corruption.
   The suspensions were ordered against William L. Parkin and his
consulting firm, Crest Inc., and Fred H. Lackner and his company,
Acris Associates.
   The suspensions will prevent the men and their companies ``from
contracting with any agency within the executive branch of the
federal government pending the outcome of legal proceedings
initiated against them,'' the Pentagon said in a statement.
   The suspension orders also will prevent the two men and their
firms from dealing with the federal government on behalf of other
defense contractors, the Navy said.
   Thursday's action had been expected since Jan. 10, when the
Pentagon first announced that Lackner, Parkin and several other
companies and individuals were being considered for suspension as a
result of a federal indictment and guilty pleas in the probe.
   During the subsequent week, the Pentagon announced it had
suspended the Hazeltine Corp., a subsidiary of Emerson Electric Co.
Inc., and the Teledyne Electronics Division of Teledyne Industries
Inc. The Pentagon also suspended without pay a Navy contracting
official indicted in the case.
   All of the actions flow from the Jan. 6 return of the first
indictment in connection with the two-year fraud investigation.
   The probe, which has been conducted over the last two years under
the code name ``Operation Ill Wind,'' focuses on allegations that
private consultants bribed government employees for information that
gave client companies an edge in winning contracts.
   The first indictment alleges that Teledyne Electronics and its
employees paid Parkin, of Alexandria, Va., to obtain details about a
Navy radar contract worth more than $100 million. Parkin then paid
Lackner, a consultant based in Woodland Hills, Calif., who in turn
gave bribes to Stuart Berlin, a Navy contracting officer, the
indictment asserts.
   Berlin, Parkin and Lackner face maximum penalties of 185 years in
prison and fines of $5.5 million each if convicted on all counts.
Teledyne Electronics faces a fine of $6.5 million if convicted.
   All three men and the company have pleaded innocent to the
charges. A federal judge has set a trial date of March 27.
   On the same day the indictment was returned, the Hazeltine Corp.
agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States,
conversion of government property and making false statements to the
government.
   Affidavits released three weeks ago suggested that Hazeltine also
hired Parkin to obtain inside information from Pentagon employees
that would allow the company to compete for a $15.9 million contract
for electronic testing gear for an aircraft identification system.

<HEAD>NATO Welcomes Soviet Plan to Reduce Short-Range Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East-West, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   NATO would welcome a unilateral
reduction in the Soviet Union's short-range nuclear missiles in
Eastern Europe, an official of the Western military alliance said
Thursday.
   Robin Stafford, a spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, said, however, the allies had to wait until the cuts
were implemented to determine their significance.
   ``In any event,'' he said, ``Soviet superiority seems certain for
some time.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told the final
session of a 35-nation conference in Vienna that Moscow will
withdraw some of its nuclear missiles from Eastern Europe. The
missiles, he said, will be pulled out along with troops who control
them.
   ``If this signals that in this field ... the Soviets are now
beginning to realize that their potential far exceeds legitimate
requirements, we can only find such steps encouraging,'' Stafford
said.
   U.S. Gen. John R. Galvin, NATO's top military commander in
Europe, said, ``If the Soviets are serious about reducing tactical
nuclear weapons, they need to make significant cuts.''
   Shevardnadze's speech came a day after Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev said in Moscow his program to slash his country's armed
forces by a half-million men would mean a reduction of 240,000
Soviet soldiers in Europe and 200,000 in Asia in the next two years.
   Gorbachev said the Kremlin's military budget will be trimmed by
14.2 percent and the production of arms and military supplies by
19.5 percent.
   Stafford, responding to Gorbachev's remarks, said, ``Any
indication that the Soviet Union is prepared to reduce its military
spending and the overwhelming imbalance in existing weaponry is to
be welcomed and encouraged.''
   He said, however, that the Soviet Union has never published
figures on total military spending. ``To speak, therefore, of
percentages of an unknown figure gives a blurred picture, which
makes it difficult to calculate what the result would be if the cuts
are, in fact, enacted,'' Stafford said.
   ``We have made public our data for years,'' Galvin said. ``It is
about time the Warsaw Pact responded.''
   Stafford also urged the Soviet Union to release it defense
figures and provide additional details on its planned reductions.
   Still, he said, ``the statement of intent nevertheless augurs
well for the atmosphere in which the coming round of arms
negotiations will be held.''
   The accord signed in Vienna by 35 nations, including the United
States, Canada and all European nations except Albania, mandates new
East-West negotiations on reducing conventional arms in Europe.
Those talks, between the 16 NATO nations and seven Warsaw Pact
countries, are to begin March 9 in Vienna.
   Shevardnadze said in his speech that Moscow has long offered to
negotiate removal of its tactical nuclear weapons and promised to
withdraw them from Europe.
   Later, at a news conference, he said only short-range weapons
that are part of military units targeted for withdrawal will be
removed and dismantled without conditions. Other tactical or
battlefield weapons, he said, were subject to negotiations.
   ``We would welcome the announced unilateral reduction by the
Soviet Union of its large tactical nuclear force,'' Stafford said.
``One of course has to wait to see how and if the announced steps
are implemented to assess their actual importance.''
   He said the allies wanted to know: ``Which systems will be
removed? How many? To where? And what happens to them then?''
   Galvin said that for talks on short-range nuclear weapons to be
held, ``we need to achieve a parity in conventional forces first.''
   NATO foreign ministers last month announced their position for
the March negotiations, known as Conventional Stability Talks.
   The Western alliance says the Soviets and their allies maintain
imbalances that give them a large superiority in conventional forces
in Europe. They want the East bloc to make much sharper reductions
in their forces to bring the two sides to equality.
   The allies also are expected to decide this spring whether to
give a go-ahead to upgrading short-range nuclear weapons in the
Western arsenal.
   The issue has gained prominence since President Reagan and
Gorbachev signed in December 1987 the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces Treaty, which provides for eliminating all U.S. and Soviet
land-based missiles with ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles.

<HEAD>Portugal, U.S. Sign New Lease Agreement On Azores Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Portugal and the United States agreed on
new terms Thursday for Washington's lease of a strategic air base in
the Azores, a government official said.
   Justice Minister Fernando Nogueira said Portugal would receive a
``substantial'' package of military equipment and increased U.S.
cooperation in business, health, education and housing in return for
continued use of the Lajes base.
   The countries have been negotiating new terms for the base, on
the Azores island of Terceira, for almost a year.
   Diplomatic sources previously said the U.S. side wanted to
formalize an agreement before President-elect George Bush took
office.
   Under the Lajes Accord, first signed in 1951, U.S. forces use the
base as a refueling point for the Air Force and as a submarine
warfare center. In return, Washington grants Portugal economic and
military aid.
   The agreement was revised in 1983 with the understanding there
would be a ``rising trend'' in U.S. assistance to Portugal.
   But fiscal 1988 saw $115 million in U.S. aid flowing into Lisbon,
compared with $117 million in 1987 and $208 million in 1985.
   Talks began last year after Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva,
worried about the decreasing aid, formally requested a review of the
accord.
   This month, Washington announced it would increase aid to
Portugal to about $150 million.
   Although the increase is not formally linked to the base
negotiations, Portuguese diplomatic sources have said they
interpreted it as a ``gesture of good will.''
   After Cavaco Silva called for a revision to the accord,
government officials said they had asked the United States to equip
their armed forces with F-16 fighter bombers, hawk missiles, combat
helicopters and other military hardware to offset the shortfall in
aid since 1985.

<HEAD>Teen with Rare Disease Gets Capitol Tour</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old California teenager suffering
from a rare form of leukemia saw his dreams come true Thursday as he
toured the White House, met two members of the Senate and even asked
the first question at an impromptu news conference.
   Jason Davis drew laughs from reporters when he ended a brief
meeting with Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., by asking the senator if he
would run for governor now that George Deukmejian has announced he
will not seek re-election.
   ``I don't know,'' a surprised Wilson said. ``A lot of people are
asking me to think about it; a lot are asking me to do it. ... Both
are great jobs; I wish I had two lives.''
   Davis got a taste of politics as he sat in the senator's chair,
posed for photographs and placed a call to Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole's office. The Kansas Republican was not in and Davis left a
message for him to call Wilson.
   Earlier in the day, Davis toured the White House and the Capitol,
and met Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska. Davis was scheduled to attend
the inauguration and a black-tie ball Friday. Wilson also arranged
for Davis to meet Vice President-elect Dan Quayle.
   The Sacramento teenager was in Washington under the auspices of
the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which helps make dreams come true for
children with life-threatening diseases. At the age of five, Davis
was diagnosed as having Fanconi anemia, which severely affects his
blood count.
   Davis had worked for the campaign of President-elect Bush and
wanted to attend the inauguration. His doctor, Mary Retzer,
contacted the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which picked up the expenses
for Davis' trip.
   ``I like science and politics. I'll get into both,'' said Davis.

   President-elect Bush challenged America's youth
Thursday to start thinking now about how to serve their country and
help build ``a better America.''
   Bush, on the eve of his inauguration, used wisecracks and wit to
emphasize the importance of education as he addressed a crowd of
5,000 high school students at the D.C. Armory.
   ``I certainly learned the importance of education during the
campaign. I learned how vital it is to memorize dates _ Pearl Harbor
day, for example,'' he said jokingly in reference to a campaign
remark in which he misstated the date of the 1941 Japanese attack on
U.S. forces in Hawaii.
   He prevented Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., from falling down a flight
of steps leading to the stage, but made a minor slip of his own as
he joked about the Harrison who delivered a notoriously long
inaugural speech.
   Bush mixed up President Benjamin Harrison with his grandfather,
William Henry, the actual perpetrator of the prolix address.
   ``I've been reading some history this week in preparation for the
swearing-in tomorrow. And one thing I've learned is that George
Washington's second inaugural address was exactly 134 words long. So
I want to take a lesson from that first George and try to keep these
remarks pretty short,'' the vice president said.
   ``And then I'd want to do better than Benjamin Harrison did,''
Bush said. ``I think he spoke for an hour and a half and then got
pneumonia and died a few weeks later. So I'll try to do better than
that tomorrow.''
   Actually, it was William Henry Harrison, the ninth president, who
refused to wear a coat in the rain at his March 4, 1841, inaugural
and droned on through 8,445 words. A month later, he became the
first president to die in office. Benjamin Harrison, his grandson,
was the 23rd president, from 1889-1893.
   Quoting Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he said, ``We can't always
build a future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the
future.''
   ``I can't predict all the twists and the turns that you'll see in
your lives, nor can I as president prepare you for them, but this I
do pledge: that I will do all in my power to help you help
yourselves prepare for a brighter future,'' Bush said.
   ``I ask that you begin now to think about how you can help your
country, think about how you can serve your country,'' he said.
   ``You see, my mission truly is to help, to reach out, to help
build a better America,'' he said. ``No president can do it without
you.''
   Bush spent much of the day at the White House, working on the
address he will deliver at noon Friday and sitting for a round of
media interviews. He was heading out to a private dinner with
relatives before an evening gala.
   ``I really feel this: our best days are yet to come. And if we
are to retain our place as a source of inspiration and hope for
people everywhere ... we must be a nation that respects ideas and
nourishes the ability of the people to develop and understand
them,'' Bush told his young audience.
   ``I do see a better-educated America, an America that respects
teachers and the noble role they fill in our society, an America
that makes it easier for families to save for college, an America
that rewards excellence,'' he said.
   The teens cheered when Bush said, ``Our American optimism about
the future is legendary and perhaps no one better personifies that
than a president named Ronald Reagan, whose shoes are going to be
pretty darn hard to fill.''
   Asked afterwards by a reporter how he planned to answer Bush's
call to service, Doug Metz, 17, a senior from Poolesville High
School in Maryland, said, ``Join the Army, I guess.''
   Yvette Gissing, 18, a senior from Chantilly High School in
Virginia, wondered if ``making people look good'' would help the
country. She wants to be a hairdresser.
   Stacey Clark, 16, a junior from La Plata High School in Maryland,
confessed that ``I didn't like Bush at first. I liked Dukakis
better.''
   ``I always thought that Bush wanted things to be the same too
much. He didn't want change. I wanted somebody who would change
things,'' said the teen-ager. But now ``he's doing better.''

   Before this inauguration day is out, a lot of
people will come blinking into the sunlight of everyday life, out of
that warm and cozy cocoon of privilege and heady exhilaration that
is life in the White House.
   ``It's a very odd and peculiar feeling,'' says one man who
experienced it eight years ago. ``What the White House is is a
four-year adrenalin high. You are working at absolutely maximum peak
performance, putting in 80 hours a week. You've got to be alert
every hour of the day, there's no such thing as a day off or a
vacation.''
   Some medical people believe that a tracking of colds and flu
cases will show a lopsided increase among government officials whose
jobs ended with the outgoing administration, says Stu Eizenstat.
``You de-adrenalize, sort of like after a big race. This is a
four-year sprint and when the sprint is over, the body feels as it's
going to fall apart for a while.''
   Eizenstat was assistant to the president for domestic affairs and
policy in the Carter administration.
   A lawyer in private life, he has become a passionate advocate of
a British-style secretariat in the White House _ a cadre of
professionals that would remain in place from administration to
administration.
   ``They are there to prevent the prime minister from stepping on
any land mines,'' Eizenstat said. ``We don't have anything like
that. We have total discontinuity.''
   His interest in establishing an American-style Privy Council was
kindled in the two transitions he witnessed, the Carter coming in
and the Carter going out.
   ``I had two meetings with my incoming counterpart, Martin
Anderson,'' he recalls. ``We talked about the same sorts of things I
talked about with Jim Cannon, who was my predecessor _ what bills
are expiring that require authorization, what are the immediate
agenda items, what hearings is Congress likely to call.''
   He said told Anderson he recognized that professional people
would be replaced with Reagan choices but that it would be wise to
keep some secretaries because they are non-political and know how
the bureaucracy works.
   ``I was told by the secretaries that a couple of days later they
were asked how they voted,'' Eizenstat said. ``Those who did not say
they voted for Reagan were dismissed.''
   For the new staffer, just going into the White House conveys a
sense of being on top of the world, Eizenstat said. But there also
is the danger of developing a sense of hubris, a certainty that you
know more than anyone else or you wouldn't be there.
   ``It's bizarre coming in on the day of inauguration because it's
a different place you came in during the transition,'' he said.
``You come into what almost looks like a gorgeous mortuary. There
are no pictures and only a few holdover secretaries.
   ``Even with Bush taing over from a president he served, you have
hardly any holdovers,'' Eizenstat said. ``Bush has a particularly
delicate problem because a number of people in the White House and
the administration view themselves not just as Reagan people but as
Bush people, who worked for him and voted for him.''
   For a staff member, saying goodbye to the White House can be
devastating. Eizenstat said his wife drove him to the passport
office and he told her to circle the block and wait for him, as he
had done the four previous years with a chauffeur at his beck and
call.
   ``She said to me, honey, you're on your own, take the Metro
home,'' Eizenstat said.
   The Washington Post cited a similar rude awakening when John
Gavin, ambassador to Mexico from 1981 to 1986 was rushing to his
first black-tie party after his return to private life. He jumped
into the back seat of his car _ only to realize there was no driver
in front.
   Elaine Crispen, Nancy Reagan's press secretary, had one of the
most prized perks of a White House employee, she had a parking space
close to the executive mansion in space No. 5.
   ``I said goodbye to No. 5 today,'' she said. ``I love No. 5. I
didn't kiss it, but I did say goodbye to it.''
   Eizenstat said the most frustrating experience was learning to
get to meetings on time, waiting for taxis. The same with tickets
and squeezing into crowded subway cars.
   Caspar Weinberger, according to the Post, was surprised after he
left his job as defense secretary by the experience of flying on
commercial jets again. ``They seat me next to people I don't even
know,'' quoted him as telling friends.
   ``It takes a couple of months to come out of it. When you are in
a senior White House or a senior Cabinet position, you never have to
worry about business. People come to you, you don't come to them.''
   As his White House life was ending, Eizenstat had a dream of what
it would be like on his first day in private law practice. ``I had a
phone on the desk, but no paper and no files. I waited and for eight
hours nothing happened, no one rang, no people came in.''
   He woke up in a cold sweat. You can bet there are others doing
the same thing today.

   President Reagan, who failed in an attempt to
name Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court, appointed him Thursday to
a group overseeing a history of the nation's highest judicial
tribunal.
   One day before leaving office, Reagan announced the appointment
of the former appeals court judge and solicitor general as a member
of the Permanent Committee for the Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise.
   The Devise is a congressionally authorized work on the history of
the Supreme Court, based in part on the papers of Justice Holmes.
   In an action that Reagan has described as one of the bitterest
disappointments of his presidency, the Senate on Oct. 23, 1987,
rejected his nomination of Bork to succeed Justice Lewis F. Powell
on the Supreme Court. Anthony M. Kennedy was later confirmed for the
seat.

<HEAD>Russian Poet's Love Letters Return To Homeland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen letters written by Russia's greatest poet,
Aleksandr Pushkin, are being returned to his homeland after decades
of being kept in France and Switzerland.
   The Soviet Union bought the letters from the estate of Serge
Lifar, the Russian-born choreographer, whose lifelong dream was to
return them to the writer's home. Lifar died two years ago.
   Once owned by a member of the czar's family, Grand Duke Mikhail,
they were acquired by Sergei Diaghilev, the famous impresario, who
died in 1929. They eventually were obtained by Lifar, the executor
of Diaghilev's will.
   The letters, wrapped in plastic, were handed over to a Soviet
delegation Wednesday night in a brief ceremony organized by
Sotheby's, the auction house that negotiated the deal.
   The price paid for the letters was not disclosed, but reports
indicated it was less than $1 million. The money is to help fund a
Serge Lifar Prize awarded annually to promising young dancers.
   Added as a gift from Countess Lillan Ahlefeldt, Lifar's Swedish
companion during the last three decades of his life, was a metal
seal with the coat of arms of Pushkin, a scion of a noble Russian
family.
   All but two of the letters were addressed to Natalya Goncharova,
whom Pushkin married in 1831 after a turbulent courtship. Pushkin
died six years later in a duel with his brother-in-law, who he felt
had attacked Natalya's honor.
   One of the letters, written in French and read aloud at the
ceremony, revealed Pushkin's feelings for Natalya and his fear his
mother would prevent their marriage.
   ``Maybe she is right and I am wrong in believing that happiness
would be mine,'' the poet wrote in his flowing handwriting while on
a trip in the Russian provinces. ``But in any case, you are
absolutely free to decide. As for myself, I give you my word of
honor that I will either belong to you or never marry.''
   The letters to Natalya were written while she was separated from
him because of a quarantine imposed on Moscow residents during a
cholera epidemic in 1830. Many letters were pierced with a pin,
apparently in the naive belief this would kill cholera germs,
experts said.
   The letters will be kept in the Pushkin Museum of Leningrad,
formerly St. Petersburg, where Pushkin, the author of ``Boris
Godunov'' and ``Eugen Onegin'' settled after his wedding.
   Yuri M. Khilchevski, the deputy Soviet minister of culture, said
it was ``very touching'' the Soviet Union obtained the letters to
Miss Goncharova.
   He said people increasingly value the ``pure source'' of
Pushkin's works, and he likened their importance in Russian
literature to the ``geological foundations of the Alps.''
   Countess Ahlefeldt told The Associated Press that Soviet experts
had paid Lifar several visits since the early 1970s but never
followed up with concrete offers for the letters.
   ``Throughout his life Serge had hoped that the letters would
return,'' she said, adding that despite great financial problems he
refused tempting offers from other countries, including the United
States.
   ``Instead of selling the letters, he would eat biscuits and take
the metro,'' she said. ``But they (the Soviets) left him waiting
until his death.''
   She said that on the morning of his death, Lifar asked her to see
if there was a letter from Moscow. ``There wasn't,'' she said.
   Lifar revolutionized French ballet as a refugee from the Soviet
Union in 1923. He died Dec. 15, 1986 at the age of 81 in Switzerland.

<TEXT>
   Finance ministers from Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada have been invited by the United
States to meet Feb. 3 in Washington to review the economic situation
in the world, a Treasury Department official said Thursday.
   Third World debt has reached $1.3 trillion and President-elect
Bush, who takes office Friday, has said he wants to have a review of
the problem.
   The invitation for the meeting of the so-called Group of Seven,
or G-7, was announced by a treasury official who spoke only on
condition of anonymity. The official said it also would be a chance
for Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and his counterparts to get
acquainted with a new member.
   Japanese Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama, who took office Dec.
27, is the new member since the group met in Berlin last September.
   Third World countries have complained about having to pay tens of
billions every year in principal and interest to wealthier
countries, money they would like to use for investments that would
check the decline in their living standards.
   On the same day as the Washington meeting, heads of the leading
Latin American debtor governments are to meet in Caracas, Venezuela.
They owe more than $440 billion of the debt.
   James A. Baker III, Bush's nominee for secretary of state, told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday that a way must
be found to get new capital to debtor countries. At the same time,
he opposed shifting the burden of their old debts from private banks
to taxpayers in the United States and other creditor countries.
   He also asked for more ``transparency'' on new credits recently
offered to the Soviet Union by banks in allied countries. Former
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has estimated those credits at
$7 billion. The money could all be going to improve fertilizer
production but the same chemicals could be used for warfare, he
added.
   Meanwhile, outgoing Commerce Secretary C. William Verity on
Thursday called for an ``academic peace corps'' in lesser-developed
countries to be financed by exchanging Third World debt for the
foreign education of American students.
   Verity said that while the program would have only a marginal
impact on the huge amounts owed by debtor nations, it could
dramatically increase the slim numbers of Americans studying in
Third World countries.
   He said America's inadequate understanding of other cultures
handicaps its dealings in international affairs and world trade.
   Less than 2,500 Americans received credit for study in Latin
American in 1986, Verity said.
   Under Verity's proposal, loans that foreign countries have
received from U.S. banks would be given or sold at a discount to
American universities, which would exchange the debt for local
currency in the foreign countries and use it to finance education
programs there.
   Banks could benefit by clearing debt from their books, debtor
nations would have their dollar debt reduced, and the universities
would obtain foreign currency at favorable prices, Verity said.
   He said several universities have expressed interest in using the
debt-for-education program, including Texas A&amp;M, Michigan State
University and Ohio State. The Commerce Department will help promote
the idea and keep banks and schools advised of swap opportunities,
he said.

<HEAD>Polish Leader: Offer to Solidarity a `Momentous Event'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski on
Thursday disclosed the government plan for legalizing Solidarity,
saying conditions to reinstate the banned union can be negotiated if
it agrees to respect the law.
   The Communist Party's position paper on trade unions and
political freedoms was a ``momentous event'' for Poland, Jaruzelski
said.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa reacted cautiously in his first
comment on the offer, but said his union was at a critical juncture
in its quest for legalization.
   ``If we blow it here, other people will have to deal with the
same problem again,'' he said in Gdansk. ``I don't want my son and
his generation to live through such things again where it
accumlates, rots and then explodes.''
   Walesa said he would await a copy of the official text of the
party document before making a more complete statement on the
conditions for reinstating the Soviet bloc's first independent trade
union.
   ``Our offer is honest and serious,'' Jaruzelski said at a rare
news conference. ``I count on the fact that taking it up
constructively will allow ... A historical step in Poland's
development. That is what we all desire.''
   The offer marks a dramatic reversal in policy for Jaruzelski and
other party leaders whose decision to impose martial law on Dec. 13,
1981, crushed the union, and reflects the failure of efforts to
eradicate the opposition in the past seven years.
   The party appears to be seeking a partnership with ``constructive
elements'' of the opposition to battle rapidly rising inflation, a
multibillion-dollar foreign debt and chronically ill-stocked stores.
   The position paper released to the media Thursday night and to be
published in newspapers nationwide Friday contains broadly written
conditions for allowing more than one legal trade union.
   Jaruzelski said Solidarity's willingness to respect Poland's
Constitution was the most important condition to legalize the union
and that details could be worked out at government-proposed
discussions.
   ``For me, an obvious and unquestionable condition, and this is a
condition, is whether Solidarity agrees to accept and will respect
the order of the socialist state, legal and constitutional,'' he
said.
   Jaruzelski declined to say when the talks, first proposed by the
authorities in August during Poland's worst wave of labor unrest in
seven years, could begin.
   Other conditions outlined in the position paper say the new
unions must be non-violent; must rely on lawful sources of funding,
an apparent reference to Solidarity's financial support from the
West; and must contribute positively to economic development, which
appeared to be an effort to discourage strikes.
   Jaruzelski said that just as the party is not the same as it was
in 1981, ``We expect that Solidarity, if it is created in its legal
form will not be the same either.''
   The party leader defended the martial law decision, saying ``I
think without martial law ... there would have been no
round-table,'' referring to the talks with the opposition.
   The paper does not contain a timetable for legalization or call
on the new unions to refrain from striking, although party leaders
have suggested a two-year trial period with no strikes.
   There is one direct reference to Soldiarity, saying it could be
one of the new trade unions created. It says the various unions at a
work place should negotiate together.
   Jaruzelski said he was optimistic the government could reach
agreement with the opposition and would not rule out a meeting with
Walesa, saying politicians ``never say never.''
   ``I think you will share the view that it was a momentous event
in the life of our party and at the same time it has a big chance to
become a turning point in the life of our country,'' Jaruzelski said
of th plenum's decisions.
   Although the television evening news opened with the Jaruzelski
news conference, a short fragment of Walesa's comments in Gdansk was
also shown on TV and the state-run news agency PAP carried a summary
of Walesa's remarks.
   The Solidarity leader sounded cautious but optimistic, saying the
decision at the party meeting showed the first signs of
understanding on the part of the authorities.
   At the news conference in the Solidarity stronghold at St.
Brygida's Church in the port city of Gdansk, Walesa said the party
offier has some positive and negative elements to consider.
   ``We can't destroy this possibility'' of true union freedom, but
``at the same time we shouldn't struggle for some ambitious
details,'' he said.
   ``It is a lot for this party ... but it is too little for social
demands and expectations,'' he said.
   The party leadership approved the document on political and union
freedom early Wednesday after a two-day meeting. Jaruzelski offered
to resign as party leader and head of state after encountering
heated opposition to the plan but then received a vote of confidence
from the 230-member Central Committee.
   Walesa said he will address shipyard workers in Gdansk on Friday,
when workers will have been able to read the party position paper.
   Adam Michnik, a senior adviser to Walesa, called the plenum ``a
step forward,'' saying that ``for the first time they announced at a
plenum that the legalization of Solidarity can be the subject of
talks.''
   Walesa has said the authorities must agree to legalize Solidarity
in order for talks with the opposition to take place.
   He said he saw invitations to speak at two legal rallies in
Warsaw next week as a sign of government good faith, and said
officials asked management at the Lenin shipyard where he works as
an electrician to excuse him for the events.

<HEAD>Agency Proposes New Rules Involving Leasing to Oil and Gas Developers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department on Thursday proposed
new rules that will give the agency a say in the leasing of national
forest land to oil and gas developers.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the department's Forest Service, said
oil and gas companies hold leases for 17 million acres of the
agency's 191 million acres of national forest land.
   In the past, leasing authority was held exclusively by the
Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management. But
leasing-revision legislation in 1987 expanded the authority of the
secretary of agriculture.
   Under the proposed rules, leases for oil and gas on forest lands
cannot be issued by BLM without approval of the Forest Service,
Robertson said.
   Final regulations will be issued after a 60-day comment period
and time for agency officials to study those comments, he said.
   Written comments can be sent to F. Dale Robertson, Chief, Forest
Service, USDA, P.O. Box 96090, Washington, D.C. 20090-6090.
   In a separate action, the Forest Service said it has begun ``new
streamlined procedures'' for handling public appeals of land and
resource management decisions by agency officials.
   The new rules separate procedures for appealing Forest Service
decisions on use and occupancy permits for national forest land from
procedures appealing decisions on land and resource managment plans.
   ``Using the two appeals channels will expedite the resolution of
disagreements between citizens and decision-makers without
unnecessarily delaying national forest management,'' Robertson said.

<HEAD>Urge Tax Credit Be Made Permanent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A task force representing both the housing
industry and tenants recommended Thursday that Congress make
permanent a tax credit to investors as an incentive for building
low-income rental housing.
   ``The low-income housing tax credit is the prime producer now of
low-income housing,'' said Elizabeth Mitchell, chairman of the group.
   ``First and foremost we believe that it should be made
permanent,'' said Ms. Mitchell, who is executive director of the
Maine State Housing Authority. ``It is vital to the successful means
employed to solving the nation's housing problems.''
   The panel also recommended that Congress extend the duration of
the low-income use compliance period, remove constraints to using
other federal subsidies with the tax credit and expand the pool of
investors who can use the credits and types of projects the credit
covers.
   The recommendations were delivered to Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine and Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., who formed
the panel to study the tax credit last May.
   Mitchell and Danforth, members of the Senate Finance Committee,
said they would use the panel's report as a basis for proposed
changes in the tax law to amend and extend the current credit.
   ``In my view it would be unthinkable not to extend the only
remaining incentive in the tax code for the health of low-income
housing,'' said Mitchell.
   The low-income tax credit was amended in 1986 to encourage
developers to invest in building and rehabilitation of housing for
low- and moderate-income people after changes took away most of the
deductions for passive losses and property depreciation.
   To get the credit, property owners must set aside either 20
percent of the units in a property for families with incomes less
than 50 percent of the median income in an area, or 40 percent for
families with incomes less than 60 percent of the area median.
   If Congress fails to act the tax credit will expire at the end of
this year.
   The panel's recommendations came on the same day the government
reported Thursday that housing construction fell to its lowest level
in six years in 1988. Earlier in the week, Jack Kemp,
President-elect Bush's choice as secretary of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, told city officials the tax revision
may have gone ``too far'' and stunted low- and moderate-income
housing construction.

   Riot police dispersed hundreds of
students on Thursday, police said, in the third straight day of
demonstrations that have left four policemen wounded and a pregnant
woman dead.
   More than 200 university students rallied in several groups in
downtown Guayaquil, 180 miles southwest of Quito, before they were
quickly dispersed by authorities Thursday without violence, police
said.
   Rafael Guerrero, governor of surrounding Guayas Province, said
members of the Marxist Democratic Popular Movement and of the
populist Roldosista Party were instigating the protests to
destabilize the nation's new center-left government.
   Roldosista chief Abdula Bucaram, a fiery and outspoken populist,
lost to left-leaning Rodrigo Borja in last year's presidential
elections, which frequently erupted in personal criticism and name
calling.
   Borja, head of the Democratic Left party, imposed unpopular
austerity measures shortly after taking office in August to combat
Ecuador's economic problems, including a decade-high inflation
figure last year of 85.7 percent.
   Borja's policies have sparked dozens of recent strikes and
several violent protests by students.
   The casualties occurred after a violence broke out Tuesday night
at a street demonstration by about 5,000 students and teachers
seeking more government funding for Guayaquil State University.
   A 27-year-old pregnant protester was overcome by tear gas and
later died at a local hospital, and four policemen suffered cuts and
bruises from objects thrown by protesters, police said.
   Police said protesters attacked cars with rocks and firebombs,
destroying three vehicles and inflicting heavy damage to 25 autos,
including 12 police cars.
   They said more than 200 people were briefly detained during the
protests and released after their identification papers were checked.
   No injuries or arrests were reported Thursday in Guayaquil, the
nation's major port and its financial hub.

   Virginia Military Institute, where
gray-uniformed cadets live by an honor code so strict they are
thrown out for lying, was in shock Thursday over two cadets' role in
a $4.5 million armored car heist.
   ``Most people are in disbelief,'' said senior Greg Skinner of New
York City. ``They can't believe it happened. It shouldn't have
happened.''
   William T. Jasinski, 22, of Boonton, N.J., and Bryan Smals, 21,
of Columbus, Ohio, were in custody awaiting a hearing Friday in
federal court in Roanoke.
   They are accused along with Jasinski's father, Robert T.
Jasinski, 51, also of Boonton, in a Dec. 22 robbery.
   The cadets told a U.S. magistrate Wednesday they put on rented
police uniforms and carried out the robbery. That acknowledgement
ensures they will be ``drummed out'' of VMI if they try to return, a
spokesman and a number of cadets said.
   ``They're dead ducks,'' VMI spokesman Tom Joynes said in an
interview. ``We hope these kids will have sense enough to resign.
   ``If they come back, they'll be dismissed by the Honor Court,
because they admitted stealing. The honor code prohibits lying,
cheating or stealing or tolerating those who do.''
   Cadets interviewed Thursday outside the school's Stonewall
Jackson barracks said the incident will harm VMI's reputation.
   ``VMI cadets are supposed to uphold the image of an honorable
person, but one bad person can give VMI a bad image,'' said Robin
Pitaniello, a junior from Lynchburg.
   But he said he was not calling the two cadets ``bad'' because he
did not know if they were guilty.
   Publicity of the heist could not have come at a worse time, with
some 400 cadets ready to march in Washington at George Bush's
inauguration Friday, Joynes noted. But he doubted the arrests would
tarnish VMI's image for long.
   ``This is the only scandal we've had in anybody's memory,''
Joynes said. ``Other schools go through this sort of thing all the
time.''
   About four or five cadets are expelled by the Honor Court each
year, generally because of lying, he said.
   ``Stealing is rare,'' Joynes said. ``I doubt we've had one of
those in 10 years.''
   Respect for the honor code is obvious to visitors of the
150-year-old VMI, which has some 1,300 cadets, all of them male.
   A reporter who stopped at a snack bar on campus noticed a dollar
bill tacked to a bulletin board. Snack bar workers said that when a
cadet finds money in the dining area, he tacks it on the board for
the person who lost it.
   But Joynes said the cadets' respect for authority may have been
what led Jasinski into going along with his father's alleged plot to
rob the armored car of Coin Depot Armored Car Co., where the elder
Jasinski worked as a part-time driver.
   ``I'm sure his father could have influenced him, but how did he
influence the other kid?'' Joynes said.
   The elder Jasinski was released Thursday on $400,000 bail backed
by the deed to his house, which Assistant U.S. Attorney John Lacey
said was valued at about $900,000. But he was represented by a
federal public defender, for which he was ruled eligible for
financial reasons by U.S. Magistrate Ronald Hedges in Newark, N.J.
   Joynes described Smals, a sophomore, as an extremely bright
English major on a Navy scholarship, while Jasinski was a C-student
and a fifth-year senior studying mechanical engineering.
   Cadets who knew the pair said they were quiet but friendly young
men who worked out a lot with weights and did not get involved in
extracurricular activities.

<HEAD>Mayors Urge Bush to Boost Reagan's Urban Aid Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's mayors, declaring their readiness
to cooperate with the Bush administration, urged the incoming
president Thursday to add $10.7 billion to President Reagan's budget
for urban aid.
   ``The last Reagan budget recommended additional cuts in urban
programs which, over the past 10 years, have shouldered an
overwhelming burden in the battle to reduce the deficit,'' the
mayors said in a statement issued at the close of their annual
winter meeting.
   The mayors said that during Reagan's eight years in office the
cumulative budget for key urban programs was cut by nearly 82
percent.
   Mayor Arthur J. Holland of Trenton, N.J., president of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, said a delegation of mayors met with Bush a
few weeks ago and left with the impression that ``the
president-elect was sensitive to our needs and would do eveything he
could to help meet those needs.''
   Holland and a bipartisan group of mayors who participated in a
news conference closing the winter meeting had high praise for Jack
Kemp, Bush's choice as secretary of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development.
   Kemp met with the mayors Wednesday, telling them:
   ``I'm going to be an activist. I'm going to be an advocate. The
door is open. My mind is open.''
   Holland said that he didn't know ``of any secretary who's
approached his responsibilities with more enthusiasm than Jack
Kemp.''
   The mayors said the budget Reagan sent to Congress last week cut
$2.7 billion over current appropriations for urban programs such as
mass transit, clean water construction grants and Urban Development
Action Grants. The mayors called for freezing those programs at
current levels.
   The mayors also called for $2 billion in additional money for
assistance to children through such programs as Head Start, Job
Corps, Medicaid and Compensatory Education.
   Finally, said the mayor, the federal government should invest an
additional $3 billion in housing, $2 billion in child care and $1
billion in Trageted Fiscal Assistance to help cities facing
financial crises.
   When Holland was asked if he had any hope that the new
administration would respond favorably to the request from the
mayors, he replied, ``To be a mayor is to live in hope.''

<HEAD>Bush, on Eve of Taking Oath, Rules Out a Quick Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of taking office as president,
George Bush said he is not inclined to meet with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for the mere purpose of keeping high-level
U.S.-Soviet contacts going.
   In a wide-ranging interview in his vice presidential office
across from the White House, Bush refused to predict whether he and
Gorbachev would even see each other during the first year of a Bush
presidency. He parted company with President Reagan on one issue _
the Panama Canal treaty _ and offered veiled criticism of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
   Bush seemed upbeat and at ease during the interview with news
service reporters. When someone suggested he might be too excited to
rest on the night before becoming president, Bush said he would be
able to sleep. ``I don't feel the tension that I thought,'' he said.
   Bush spent most of the day out of the public eye. He did venture
out for a meeting with top high school youths from around the
country and pledged there to do ``all in my power to help you help
yourselves prepare for a brighter future.''
   Bush offered some of his characteristic optimism _ a quality
shared with Ronald Reagan _ to the students. ``I really feel this,''
he told them. ``Our best days are yet to come.''
   The vice president rehearsed the inaugural address that he will
deliver at noon Friday, when Reagan relinquishes office and Bush
assumes it in a ceremony outside the Capitol.
   In his interview, Bush said a puported tape-recorded threat by
Palestine Liberation Organization chief Arafat against moderate
Arabs was ``a setback to peace rather than an enhancement of
peace.'' He said the threat ``does not facilitate improved relations
with Arafat,'' who won American support after he made a public
commitment to renounce terrorism.
   On another subject, Bush seemed to differ with Reagan's statement
Wednesday that the United States should reconsider the treaties to
turn over the operation of the Panama Canal to Panama, if strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega remains in power.
   ``The treaty has certain obligations that ought to be met,'' Bush
said. ``I'm a great believer that once a treaty is entered into and
ratified, it ought to be kept. But I'd have to look at the treaty
before I have any comment on that.''
   Previewing his inaugural address, Bush said, ``It will be just a
broad appeal to the American people to pitch in and help. It'll be
an expression of satisfaction about how far we've come as a nation,
and a recognition that we've got a long way to go.
   ``It will be a re-emphasis of my conviction that many of these
problems that remain unsolved can best be solved by engagement of
the `thousand points of light' concept'' of people helping people.
   On other points, Bush said:
   _He plans a meeting Tuesday with the Democratic and Republican
leaders of Congress.
   _The idea of a dramatic 100-day beginning of his administration
is ``a concept that doesn't really apply'' in his case because he's
taking over from a president with whom he's served.
   _He would like to be further along in picking candidates for
high-level positions below the rank of Cabinet secretary but added
``we're doing all right on it.''
   _Reducing the budget deficit is his top priority. ``This is the
No. 1 domestic economic problem facing the country.'' He said the
administration will negotiate with Congress on the problem, adding
``I'm not quite naive enough to believe they'll accept absolutely
everything I propose.''
   _He wants early action on tightening ethics laws. Moreover, he
said, ``I'd like to see some action on not only formulating the
policy but taking certain steps towards more accomplishment and
understanding in the environmental field.'' He said anti-drug
efforts would gear up.
   _Money will not be available ``to do all the things I want to do
and that I feel are priority'' in the field of education. ... Some
of what I want to do obviously is going to have to wait on the
solution to the budget question.''
   _He will not follow Reagan's practice of making a weekly Saturday
address on the radio.
   Bush said one of his first acts as president would be to order a
major review of U.S. relations with the Soviets, a step that will
delay any chance of quick movement in strategic arms reduction talks
set to resume Feb. 15.
   ``I don't think we risk losing momentum that President Reagan
achieved because I think the Soviets understand that my intention is
not to drag my feet but to simply do a prudent reassessment,'' Bush
said.
   Bush said he did not know how long the review would take, even to
the point of whether it would take up to six months or a year. He
said the United States also will have to review its posture
regarding conventional arms talks involving NATO and Warsaw Pact
nations.
   Asked to rate the odds of a summit with Gorbachev this year, Bush
said, ``I don't think we can make the odds, and more important than
that is (that) we have good sound positions that we will be
advocating. And whether that results in a summit or not, I think, is
less important than the fact that the process will go forward.''
   Asked if he shared Reagan's view that there was some value in a
summit just to meet and talk, Bush said, ``Not necessarily _ but I
won't say that that would never happen.
   ``What I don't want to do, though, and won't do, is schedule a
meeting just to have it said that we're having a meeting, because I
don't think that does anything but needlessly raise expectations
with little chance of fulfillment of some objective.''
   Saying he did not want to be hemmed in by life at the White
House, Bush promised to change the pattern set by Reagan of sticking
to a carefully orchestrated schedule, never leaving the White House
without advance warning to the press.
   ``I can't pledge to be anchored down,'' Bush said. ``You just
don't want to get totally isolated.''

<HEAD>Britain Warns Its Nationals to Leave Afghanistan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain issued an advisory Thursday
urging its nationals and citizens of six other countries for whom it
has diplomatic responsibility to leave Afghanistan immediately.
   Officials at the U.S. Embassy said they probably would give the
same advice to the dozen or so American missionaries still in the
country. Western embassies also confer regularly about whether to
close.
   Britain's warning coincided with reports that all Soviet troops
in Kabul would withdraw by early February along the Salang highway,
the main route north to the Soviet border, to guard the final
departure from Afghanistan by a Feb. 15 deadline.
   When Soviet forces are gone, after more than nine years, the
Afghan civil war will be back in the hands of the government's
poorly trained conscript army and Moslem guerrillas who began
fighting after a communist coup in April 1978.
   As the Soviet soldiers have withdrawn under a U.N.-mediated
agreement, guerrillas have increased attacks on the Salang highway
to stop supply convoys from reaching Kabul. The result has been
acute food and fuel shortages that are growing worse.
   The insurgents predict a quick victory over the forces of
President Najib, and some Western diplomats agree. One said Najib's
regime should ``fall fairly fast after the Soviet withdrawal is
complete.''
   Clovis Meath Baker, the British charge d'affaires, summoned the
few British journalists in the capital and delivered what he called
``a final warning'' to leave ``while normal flights are still
available.''
   In a letter to the 71 Britons, Australians, Canadians, New
Zealanders, Irish, Danes and Finns still in the country, Meath Baker
said: ``There is no question of any subsequent evacuation being
arranged by the British government.''
   At the Foreign Office in London, a spokesman said in announcing
the warning: ``The situation in Kabul is deteriorating. There are
food shortages, fuel shortages and the probability is that these
will get worse nearer to the Russian withdrawal.
   ``Near the time of the withdrawal, you can't guarantee commercial
flights will come in and out.''
   An informed Soviet source said privately all Red Army troops were
expected to be out of Kabul early in February, along with the Soviet
high command.
   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and
an estimated 115,000 were in the country when the withdrawal began
May 15 under an agreement signed in Geneva a month earlier. Half
were gone by Aug. 15 and the remainder are to be out by Feb. 15.
   The guerrillas, most of whom are based in border camps and cities
just inside Pakistan, were not parties to the Geneva agreement and
have rejected offers of a coalition government from Najib.
   Kabul radio said Thursday that government troops shot down two
Pakistani helicopters ferrying ``foreign advisers'' and guerrilla
leaders to the eastern Nangarhar province. It said everyone aboard
was killed but did not give casualty figures. Pakistan routinely
denies such reports by official Afghan media.
   Another radio report said a rocket attack wounded five people at
a 315-bed hospital in Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city.
It blamed the insurgents, who are supported by the United States and
Pakistan.
   Most of the Britons and others warned by the embassy are with
U.N. agencies or the International Committee of the Red Cross, which
has a hospital for war wounded in Kabul.
   Also among the Britons are 19 resident missionaries, with their
families, who work for the charitable International Aid Mission.
Families of most foreigners left last summer after the first half of
the Soviet withdrawal was complete.

<HEAD>USDA Says Beef Rule Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new rule allowing the separation, or
uncoupling, of beef quality and beef yield grades has been approved
and will take effect April 9, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   J. Patrick Boyle, head of the department's Agricultural Marketing
Service, said the change was in response to a petition filed in June
1987 by the American Meat Institute and the National Cattlemen's
Association.
   ``The rule allows the beef industry to determine whether to have
carcasses graded by USDA for quality, or for yield, or both,'' Boyle
said. ``Previously, a carcass had to be grade both for quality and
yield, or not graded at all.''
   Meat grading is a voluntary program offered by the agency and is
paid for by user fees.
   Boyle said the trade associations asked for the rule changes ``in
order to utilize new, more efficient technologies now available for
preparing beef carcasses, one of which is hot-fat trimming just
after slaughter'' instead of trimming after the carcasses are
chilled, as is the current practice.
   The new rule ``should benefit producers, packers and consumers
alike. It allows packers the option to use new technologies, and
also may allow cattle producers to be compensated for the lean meat
yield of their animals,'' he said.
   Manly Molpus, president of the American Meat Association, said he
was ``extremely pleased'' by the USDA action and that it will give
the industry ``the flexibility it has long needed.'' Now, he added,
the marketplace, rather than the government, can better determine
how beef is marketed.

   George Bush, saying he doesn't want to be
``anchored down,'' indicated Thursday he will keep on making
spur-of-the-moment jaunts around town as president _ with or without
reporters in tow.
   Bush voiced clear skepticism over the practice in which a small
``protective pool'' of reporters follows a president whenever he
leaves the White House _ whether on official business or personal
business.
   ``What's being protected?'' Bush asked in an inauguration-eve
interview with a group of news service reporters.
   ``You mean, if something happened like I fell over and choked at
a restaurant? What if I fall over and choke in the White House?
You're not there.''
   ``I can't pledge to be anchored down. I'd like to work out some
understanding that the world is not going to come to a screeching
halt if you don't know that I'm eating Peking duck over in
Virginia,'' Bush said.
   ``You may not agree with that,'' he said. ``But I think it's
silly to have to feel that, when the president goes out of that
thing (the White House) that serious journalists, or their editors,
feel the nation's business will come to a halt if that is not
reported.''
   Bush as vice president has been known for venturing into public
places frequently _ often going to restaurants with family and
friends, dropping in a neighborhood delicatessen, shopping in super
markets and visiting hardware stores.
   This style contrasts sharply with that of President Reagan, who
seldom left the White House except with advance notice or without a
travel pool of reporters in his motorcade.
   ``I'm not going to give up my ability to make a decision in a
hurry,'' Bush said.
   He suggested that, for one thing, going around town with a large
entourage that includes reporters can make it harder to find a
parking place in front of a restaurant.
   Bush said if he decides at the last minute to have dinner with
friends ``at Joe's Bar or Joe's Restaurant, we've got to be able to
be flexible.''
   ``And you shouldn't have to be rudely treated by standing out in
the cold wondering what the hell I've ordered in a Chinese
restaurant,'' Bush said.
   ``I'm not going to shake you,'' Bush added. ``But I'm not going
to feel obligated to say we can't do this for an hour because we've
got to notify (the news media).''

   Barbara Bush, displaying the ``wicked wit''
that has become her trademark, was cheered by thousands of
supporters Thursday as she poked fun at her appearance, joked about
her husband's fishing and bragged about her family.
   Mrs. Bush, a 63-year-old grandmother with snow white hair and an
imposing figure, appeared at the ``Salute to the First Lady,'' an
event that more than 6,000 people paid $50 a ticket to attend.
   The gathering, held at the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts, drew so many people that Mrs. Bush and Marilyn
Quayle, the wife of Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, appeared before
audiences in the concert hall, the opera hall and the theater.
   ``Speaking of glamor, I want you to look at me very carefully,''
said Mrs. Bush, who often indulges in self-deprecating remarks.
   As the crowd roared, Mrs. Bush stood on the stage and pointed to
herself: ``Please notice the hair, the makeup, designer clothes. ...
I want you to watch me all week and remember _ You may never see it
again.''
   Mrs. Bush, wearing a blue suit _ her favorite color _ with a
large patterned bow at her neck, called the tribute ``unbelievable''
and ``undeserved.''
   The blunt-spoken Mrs. Bush, known for her candor and lack of
pretense, also poked fun at her husband's complaints this week that
packing for the move to the White House was a laborious and tedious
process.
   Noting that Bush spent last weekend fishing in Florida, his wife
of 43 years said: ``So much to the packing story.''
   Mrs. Bush, who is fiercely loyal to her husband and five children
and their families, later said she considered herself the ``world's
luckiest woman'' because she had married ``a man I love more than
life.''
   Actors Bruce Boxleitner and Charlton Heston and actress Cheryl
Ladd read virtually identical scripts as they introduced Mrs. Bush
to successive audiences. They described her as ``kind, generous,
warm and dedicated,'' with values that are similar to those held by
most Americans.
   Mrs. Quayle, in presenting Mrs. Bush to the audiences, had a
difficult time controlling her emotions. ``I'm going to get weepy
because Barbara is so special,'' said the wife of the vice
president-elect, a lawyer with three children.
   ``Barbara Bush brings joy, a wicked wit ... and an indomitable
spirit that she will take to the White House,'' Mrs. Quayle said.
   ``She's the one who is going to cry in the family,'' Mrs. Bush
joked.
   At each hall, Mrs. Bush was entertained by performers ranging
from the National Symphony Orchestra to the Preservation Hall Jazz
Band to the Gatlin Brothers.
   But the obvious hit of the day was the Mora Ariaga Mariachis
band, a group that played Mexican music and featured Noelle Bush,
Mrs. Bush's 11-year-old, Spanish-speaking granddaughter. The girl
sang, danced and played the accordion.
   ``Unless there is an enormous change in our family ... all the
talent was put in one child,'' Mrs. Bush said after Noelle had
presented her grandmother with a huge sombrero.
   Noelle is the daughter of Jeb Bush, a Miami real estate
developer, and his Mexican-born wife, Columba. Mrs. Bush took pride
in introducing Columba, as well as her three other daughters-in-law
and her own daughter, Dorothy LeBlond, to the audiencs.
   Although the speakers talked of Mrs. Bush's keen interest in
promoting literacy and her desire to spotlight other social
problems, the incoming first lady kept her remarks brief and on the
light side.
   The tribute was one of the few inaugural events that Mrs. Bush
was to attend without her husband. The couple stayed in the
presidential guest quarters at Blair House on Wednesday night in
preparation for the move across Pennsylvania Avenue to the White
House after Friday's swearing-in ceremony.
   About 250 Bush relatives are in town for the festivities. A
private dinner with family members was planned Thursday night. On
Friday night, Mrs. Bush's mother-in-law, Dorothy Walker, 87, the
Bush's five children, their spouses and 10 grandchildren will sleep
in the White House.

<HEAD>Japanese Company Says It Can Detect Hidden TNT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese company said Thursday it has developed a
test that can seek out even the tiniest traces of the explosive TNT.
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has not decided whether it
will apply the technology to make bomb detection devices, but could
do so in two or three years, said Matsushita official Jun Asai said.
   Asai said Matsushita's ``biosensing technology'' can detect
one-billionth of a gram per cubic centimeter of TNT existing in the
atmosphere as vapor or microscopic particles.
   If terrorists carried any substances containing TNT, he said, TNT
particles would leak into the nearby atmosphere, where the new
technology could detect them.
   He said Matsushita's Central Research Laboratory first developed
a protein, called an antibody, with a high affinity for TNT. Testers
can collect atmospheric components from any substances that they
believe contain TNT and make a water solution with the antibody.
When TNT binds to the antibody, fluorescent light from the antibody
will decrease, Asai added.
   He said Matsushita discovered the technology while studying the
possibility of developing antibodies that can detect odors beyond
the sensitivity limits of animals, and detect diseases such as
tumors, high blood pressure and cerebral thrombosis.

   The message was written in block leters on the side
of a boarded-up market:
   It read: ``HELP.''
   In Miami's impoverished and predominantly black Overtown
district, the plea could easily symbolize the area's turbulent
present and uncertain future.
   The graffiti-covered building stands two blocks from where a
Hispanic police officer fatally shot a 23-year-old black
motorcyclist Monday night, triggering violence fueled by frustration
over unemployment and an influx of Central American refugees.
   Many of the 10,000 Overtown residents look beyond the arson,
gunfire and looting toward the specter of downtown development that
threatens to wipe out the once-vibrant neighborhood.
   ``We may be seeing the beginning of the end of Overtown,'' said
Rev. Richard Barry of St. Agnes Episcopal Church, in the heart of
the neighborhood. ``You see them building expensive condos over by
Miami Arena. The city fathers want to change downtown. That means
getting rid of Overtown.
   ``Among all the burned-out buildings and neglect, there's hardly
anyone who remembers that Overtown has a rich history.''
   The first residents of the area were black workers extending the
Florida East Coast railroad south from West Palm Beach in the 1890s.
They built the area into a flourishing business and residential
community by the 1950s.
   But highway construction for the growing Miami metropolis in the
1960s forced many black middle-class residents and business owners
out of what was then known as the Central Negro District.
   The name Overtown derives from the conversations of people
planning to visit the neighborhood.
   ``They'd say I'm going `over-town,''' said Leome Culmer, chairman
of the speakers' bureau of the Black Archives of Miami. ``It was
quite a place back then.''
   But the legacy of Overtown's heyday has long since disappeared.
``What's left was low-income blacks in a congested area and without
jobs,'' said Barry.
   Since the riots of 1980 claimed 18 lives and dozens of businesses
citywide, the decline of Overtown has been steady, residents say.
   City officials, Overtown residents claim, have focused on the
surge of Cuban and Central American refugees at the expense of job
and housing programs in black neighborhoods, including Overtown and
Liberty City, which is about 30 blocks to the north.
   Liberty City was started as a residential development for blacks
in the 1920s to relieve overcrowding in Overtown.
   Overtown now is a collection of struggling stores and
deteriorating two-story apartment buildings. Palm trees are
surrounded by junk and litter in vacant lots. A 1983 city study
placed the unemployment rate at more than 36 percent.
   ``There's probably crack on every corner,'' said police spokesman
Raymond Lange, referring to the addictive and low-cost form of
cocaine.
   Stephen Wayne traveled from rural Alabama to Miami in search of
construction work. He ended up on a second-floor apartment, in sight
of a supermarket burned during Tuesday night's violence.
   ``I have a gun. Everyone I know has a gun. I don't like going out
on any night,'' he said. ``If I could leave I would.''

   The 50,000 Soviet troops being pulled out
of Eastern Europe will take the nuclear missiles and other arms
under their control with them, the Soviet foreign minister said
Thursday.
   A NATO spokesman welcomed the announcement by Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze as ``encouraging.'' U.S. arms negotiator Stephen
Ledogar said the speech was ``very upbeat, very positive,'' but
warned against reading more into the statement than the Kremlin
intended.
   Shevardnadze's speech came on the final day of a gathering that
produced a 35-nation human rights accord. Shevardnadze said the
agreement was the product of a changing relationship between East
and West.
   ``The Vienna meeting has shaken up the Iron Curtain, weakened its
rusty supports, made new breaches in it and hastened its
corrosion,'' he said, referring to the East-West division as Winston
Churchill described it 40 years ago.
   ``Truth must be visible,'' Shevardnadze said in promising that
the Kremlin would publish before the end of the month a timetable
for troop removal.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a unilateral move,
announced in December that Soviet forces would be cut by 500,000
soldiers, including 50,000 stationed in Eastern Europe.
   Shevardnadze said the troops departing Eastern Europe will take
with them ``all their organic armaments, including tactical nuclear
systems.''
   He also said the Soviet Union has stopped modernizing its
short-range nuclear weapons and called on the United States to
follow suit.
   Those arms are tactical missiles with a range of less than 312
miles. The Soviet Union and the United States signed an accord more
than a year ago to eliminate all intermediate-range nuclear forces
and are negotiating deep cuts in strategic arms.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said last month the
Soviet troop withdrawal would reduce the Warsaw Pact's edge in
divisions in Europe only to 2.91-to-1 from 2.99. NATO estimates
Soviet forces in Europe at 2.2 million.
   The Center for Defense Information, a private research group,
estimated the Soviets have 1,400 land-based short-range nuclear
mssiles in Europe. It said the missiles, all mobile, are 600 Scuds,
660 SS-21s and 140 Frogs.
   Ledogar, the U.S. ambassador to arms talks that are to start in
March, said modernization is an option the United States would like
to keep until NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact have an equal
number of troops, tanks and other non-nuclear forces.
   ``We don't want to abandon the nuclear leg of the deterrent until
we have a much better situation on conventional forces,'' he told
The Associated Press.
   During a brief exchange with reporters after his speech,
Shevardnadze made it clear that only short-range weapons that are
part of the military units to be withdrawn will be dismantled
without conditions.
   He said he could not say what percentage of the Kremlin's
short-range stockpile would remain deployed but that these figures
and others will be released in detail before the March 9 start of
the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe negotiations.
   Those talks are mandated in the human rights accord approved
Sunday by the United States, Soviet Union, Canada and 32 European
nations. The agreement also calls for freer travel, emigration,
speech and religious practices.
   Shevardnadze held a brief, impromptu news conference later in the
day, and was asked to describe the difference between the Berlin
Wall and the Iron Curtain he disparaged in his speech.
   He said the wall, which has divided Berlin since it was erected
27 years ago, is a matter for East Germany.
   ``We have no intention of interfering in the sovereign affairs of
this country and advise others to do likewise,'' he said.
   East German Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer alluded to the wall in
a speech Thursday and suggested that calls for it to be torn down
infringe on his nation's sovereign rights.
   In his speech, Shevardnadze praised his U.S. counterpart,
Secretary of State George Shultz, who steps down Friday with the end
of the Reagan era.
   ``I shall permit myself to pay tribute to him for everything that
he endeavored, managed to do, and achieved in our common efforts,''
Shevardnadze said.
   After a meeting with Shevardnadze, Italian Foreign Minister
Giulio Andreotti announced that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will visit Italy in November.
   No Soviet Communist Party chief has visited Italy and analysts
said the trip could set the stage for an historic meeting with Pope
John Paul II. The Vatican always has said the pope would be open to
such a meeting.

   The government has ordered an
anti-apartheid activist to explain why he should not have his
political activities restricted, even though he died last year, his
father said Thursday.
   Black student leader Caiphus Nyoka was shot 12 times when police
raided his house on Aug. 24, 1987, in Daveyton, a township near
Johannesburg. Police said they shot Nyoka, 23, when he attempted to
reach for an object under his bed.
   More than 1,000 people attended his funeral, which was monitored
by scores of police.
   The government sent a letter, dated Jan. 10, to Nyoka's house
stating that the activist was to be placed on a list of restricted
activists, said his father, Abednego Nyoka.
   ``It's such an insult,'' said the elder Nyoka. ``I have a death
certificate from the government. Why are they doing this? They are
making a mockery of his death.''
   The letter said Nyoka had 30 days to show ``why your name ought
not to be entered in the consolidated list.''
   The letter added that if Nyoka wanted to stay off the list, he
would have to prove he did not know that his organization was
involved in activities that ``might render it to be declared
unlawful.''
   Nyoka was active in the Congress of South African Students, one
of dozens of banned organizations fighting South Africa's system of
racial segregation.
   The New Nation, a weekly aimed at black readers, reported
Thursday that hundreds of activists recently received letters
similar to the one sent to Nyoka.
   The restrictions vary, but they often bar activists from
participating in politics, speaking to journalists, or traveling
from their hometown.
   A spokesman for the Justice Ministry, Dirk de Villiers, declined
comment on the matter.

   President Reagan made the final public speech
of his presidency a fittingly patriotic one Thursday as he presented
the Medal of Freedom to Secretary of State George P. Shultz and
Ambassador Mike Mansfield and saluted them as ``two remarkable
Americans.''
   ``Since this is the last speech that I will give as president, I
think it is fitting to give one final thought: an observation about
a country that I love,'' Reagan said.
   ``There is nothing so precious and irreplaceable as America's
freedom,'' added Reagan in the patriotic manner that has marked his
speeches for decades.
   ``America's freedom does not belong to just one nation,'' he
said. ``We are custodians of freedom for the world.''
   ``We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our
people and our strength from every country and every corner of the
world.''
   The president described the United States as ``always on the
cutting edge, always leading the world to the next frontier.''
   Reagan said the Medal of Freedom, awarded for contributions to
the national interest, world peace and cultural achievement among
other endeavors, ``represents the reverence Americans have for
liberty.''
   He said Mansfield, former Senate majority leader who recently
resigned after more than a decade as ambassador to Japan, had
``distinguished himself as a dedicated public servant.''
   Mansfield, accepting the medal, said Reagan had ``laid out a
sound policy for our future in the Pacific and East Asia'' and ``for
the first time in memory, we have both a president of the United
States and a secretary of state who are actively interested in the
Pacific, in Japan and in East Asia.''
   ``I anticipate that the policy these men have laid down will be
continued,'' he added.
   Reagan said Shultz had ``inaugurated a new era of hope in foreign
policy'' and presided over the State Department ``during one of the
most critical periods in the history of this nation's foreign
policy.''
   Shultz, in his response, said, ``There is a phrase that's
catching on. `The Reagan years.' And, Mr. President, it has a ring
to it. It's the ring of freedom. You have adocated it, fought for
it.''
   ``You have known that the price of freedom is enternal vigilance
... that there are times when it requires action, sometimes at least
at first not necessarily popular action, but you have to do it,'' he
said.
   Mansfield paid tribute to his wife, Maureen, in his remarks and
Shultz walked over to his wife's table, gave her a kiss and handed
the medal to her after receiving it at the ceremony in the East Room.
   Among those in the audience was Vernon Walter, U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, who earlier in the day received the Citizens
Medal from Reagan. The Citizens Medal is given to ctizens who have
performed deeds of service to their country or their fellow citizens.

   Turkey output is not expanding as rapidly this
year, and consumers can expect higher prices farther down the line,
the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Production is expected to increase about 3 percent to an
estimated 4.05 billion pounds from about 3.033 billion pounds in
1988. That would be only half the 6 percent increase in turkey meat
output from 1987 to 1988, the department's Economic Research Service
said.
   ``Turkey producers are slowing their rate of increase after two
years of lackluster returns,'' the agency said. ``Wholesale hen
turkey prices in the eastern region averaged 61 cents per pound in
1988 and are expected to average 63 to 69 cents in 1989.''
   Another report, which was issued by the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board, said that surveys of turkey growers surveyed in 20
major producing states intend to boost the number of birds _ not in
pounds _ by 7 percent from last year.
   However, the report acknowledged the number of turkeys actually
raised in 1989 ``may vary from growers' intentions'' depending on
feed costs, the supply of hatching eggs and various other factors.
   The report said U.S. turkey production in 1988 totaled more than
242 million birds, up 1 percent from about 240.4 million in 1987.
   North Carolina was first last year with 47.9 million turkeys,
followed by Minnesota, 38.5 million; California, 26.5 million;
Arkansas, 18 million; Missouri, 16.5 million; and Virginia, 16.3
million.

   When Congress passed a bill designating
National Asparagus Month during a crush of important legislation
last year, for Rep. Dave McCurdy it was the last stalk.
   The Oklahoma Democrat on Thursday introduced legislation to ban
Congress' growing practice of passing commemmorative bills, and
instead create an 11-member advisory panel to judge the merits of
various requests for commemorative days, weeks, months and years.
   McCurdy pointed out in a statement that more than one-third of
the laws passed in the last Congress were in the commemorative
category. Among bills introduced were Snow White Week, National
Dairy Goat Awareness Week and National Elvis Presley Day. In all,
646 such bills were introduced in the 100th Congress.
   ``The annual costs of commemorative legislation cannot be
precisely determined, but we know from examining the process that
they are enormous,'' McCurdy said. ``The annual printing costs of
the resolutions alone run into the hundreds of thousands of
dollars.''
   McCurdy said most of the commemmorative bills are worthy, but his
bill was a more ``common-sense approach'' to deciding which to
recognize than spending time on the floor of a billion-dollar
Congress.

   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. appeared under subpoena
Thursday before a federal grand jury investigating his ties to a
suspected drug dealer. Barry told reporters he had done nothing
wrong and was not the target of the probe.
   ``I'm not in trouble,'' Barry said at an impromptu news
conference as he headed into the grand jury's meeting room in the
federal courthouse. ``The public sometimes has the impression that
going before a grand jury means that someone is guilty ... but it
only means they are investigating. That's the American way.''
   Barry met with the grand jury for about three hours. He said
little to reporters afterward.
   Kenneth Mundy, Barry's attorney, said he has received assurances
that Barry is not a target of the probe. Federal officials were not
available to comment on Mundy's comment.
   Officials also refused to comment on Barry's appearance before
the grand jury, but had earlier said that investigators are
gathering information on whether Barry thwarted a police drug probe
and are also looking into the possible misuse of government funds.
   The mayor was subpoenaed after failing to answer an informal
request that he appear. Barry is expected to testify before the
grand jury again next week, Mundy said.
   On Dec. 22, police were inexplicably called off an attempt to
make an undercover drug purchase from a former city employee,
Charles Lewis, after Barry showed up at his hotel room. Barry has
also acknowledged contacting police officials looking into the
affair, but said he was only trying to speed up the probe.
   District of Columbia Police Chief Maurice Turner has denied that
police were tipped off that Barry was in Lewis' room, but did say
that detectives were called off their attempted drug purchase by the
hotel's manager.
   The grand jury is also hearing testimony on a joint personnel
project involving the district and the U.S. Virgin Islands
government. Lewis, a former city employee, spearheaded that project
for the Virgin Islands. He was fired last April after Virgin Islands
officials expressed concern about cost overruns on the project.
Barry and other top city officials ran up hotel and restaurant bills
of more than $37,000 in connection with the project.
   So far, Lewis, city personnel director Theodore E. Thornton and a
personal bodyguard who accompanied Barry to Lewis' hotel room have
testified at least once before the panel.
   Barry's telephone records, police phone logs, and thousands of
documents connected with the Virgin Islands personnel project have
also been subpoenaed. Those include contracts officials have said
were prepared and back-dated well after the project began.
   Because of his connections with Lewis, Barry, 52, is mired in his
worst political crisis in the decade he has served as mayor of the
nation's capital.
   Barry's latest troubles have revived persistant rumors that he
uses drugs and associates with drug users, while he and his
associates have also come under fire for the city's involvement in
the Virgin Islands project.
   The Interior Department, which oversees affairs of the Virgin
Islands government, has not been able to find a written contract for
the $260,000 project, and Virgin Islands Gov. Alexander Farrelly has
said that the spending overruns means the district may not be paid
the $80,000 in costs it has claimed.
   Barry attempted to quell questions about his alleged drug use by
taking a drug test Tuesday.
   Dr. Vincent J. Roux, the mayor's personal physician, pronounced
Barry drug-free after testing his urine for up to 10 illegal drugs,
including marijuana, cocaine and barbituates.
   However, John White, the mayor's press secretary, said he did not
know whether the mayor's blood was tested for drugs. Medical experts
have said that blood testing is more exhaustive and can show traces
of drugs that a urine test won't turn up.

   Entertainer Wayne Newton on Thursday accepted
a $6 million libel award that had been collecting interest while he
pursued his lawsuit against NBC, saying he is satisfied his
reputation has been restored.
   ``This was not a matter of money. This was a matter of
vindication of my name,'' the singer said after filing papers in
federal court to collect the award over a 1980 NBC broadcast linking
him to an organized crime figure.
   A federal jury in Las Vegas awarded a record $22.3 to Newton in
1986, but a judge reduced it to $5.3 million and last month ordered
him to accept the lower sum or face proving his case again in a new
trial, this time in Los Angeles.
   Newton's lawyer, Morton Galane, said that with interest, the $5.3
million award now equals $6 million. ``Such an amount would be
higher than any (libel) award ever affirmed by an appellate court in
the history of this nation,'' he said.
   Galane said a survey conducted for Newton satisfied him that his
image had been restored and that the public understood that he had
won his case.
   NBC said Thursday it would appeal. The network said in a
statement that a trial in Los Angeles would be less likely to
produce the results seen in Las Vegas.
   ``Mr. Newton's refusal to put his case before a Los Angeles jury
speaks for itself on all the issues, including whether NBC libeled
Mr. Newton,'' said Thomas B. Ross, NBC senior vice president of news.
   The jury had ruled that the singer was defamed in a series of
broadcasts. NBC correspondent Brian Ross had reported that Newton
went to a reputed mob figure for help after his 3-year-old
daughter's life was threatened.
   Newton argued the report left the impression that his 1980
purchase of the Aladdin Hotel was linked to organized crime.

   Rebels ambushed a railroad relief convoy

   Al-Guwat Al-Musalaha, the military's biweekly magazine, said the

   The military report also said Wednesday that 16 people were

   The government said the convoy of four trains reached its

about 600 miles away. It said the attack took place last week but
did not give an exact date.
   The convoy left Khartoum on Jan. 5 with food, medicine and relief
supplies for refugees from the civil war in the south.
   The rebels have fought the government since 1983, demanding

<HEAD>Prosecutor Investigates Kidney Donations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutor Sait Erem said Thursday he was
investigating allegations that four Turks illegally sold their
kidneys for transplants at a London hospital.
   Erem told The Associated Press that Turkish law allows human
organs to be donated for humanitarian reasons but forbids their
sale. Those involved in a sale could receive prison terms of two to
four years if convicted, he said.
   He said he started investigating after a Turkish peasant claimed
in a letter to his office Jan. 10 that one of his kidneys was
removed at the private Wellington Humana Hospital in London without
his knowledge or consent.
   The peasant alleged that three other Turks donated kidneys at the
hospital through a middleman, Tunc Ay Kunter of Turkey, and received
as much as $5,600 each, Erem reported. The donors underwent the
operations because of financial difficulties, Erem quoted the letter
as saying.
   Erem identified the peasant as Ahmet Koc, a 33-year-old man from
Gulluce village in eastern Turkey.
   He said Koc claimed in his petition that Kunter approached him
while Koc was job-hunting in Istanbul.
   ``I was offered work in Britain by Kunter and underwent medical
checkups at clinics in Istanbul and later in London under his
guidance as part of the immigration procedure. I also signed
documents in English which I did not understand. Then I was taken to
a hotel, which in fact was a hospital,'' Erem quoted Koc as saying.
   ``Only later I found out that one of my kidneys had been removed
and transplanted to a Libyan doctor.''
   The prosecutor quoted Koc as saying he was paid $4,600 in
September and then returned to Turkey.
   Kunter, a 55-year-old retired military officer, said during
questioning Tuesday that he acted as a middleman in the four kidney
donations, but that he made the arrangements for humanitarian
reasons, not profit, according to Erem.
   The prosecutor also said Kunter showed him an advertisement in
the daily newspaper Hurriyet in which Koc offered to sell his
kidney. Kunter said he contacted the other donors after seeing
similar ads placed by them, Erem said.
   Kunter told authorities Koc lodged his complaint after his
demands for more money were refused, Erem said.
   Erem said he was investigating to find out if Kunter and his
London-based brother received money from kidney recipients.
   The prosecutor said Dr. Raymond Crockett allegedly performed the
kidney removal operations.
   The London daily Independent reported Wednesday that Crockett and
an unidentified hospital official said all the donors consented to
the operations.
   It also quoted the British Health Department as saying trade in
kidneys for transplants is discouraged but not illegal in Britain.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said Thursday
that Syrian President Hafez Assad has made a firm commitment to her
to work for the release of the nine American hostages held in
Lebanon.
   Oakar, who met with Assad for more than four hours in Damascus,
Syria, on Jan. 9, said in an interview that Assad was ``very
positive in saying that he would help'' in the hostage situation.
   Oakar's comments came as President Reagan told reporters a day
before leaving office that he was frustrated by his inability to
free the Americans in war-torn Lebanon.
   ``We don't know where they are,'' Reagan said, adding officials
are working ``quietly and privately'' to win freedom for the
hostages.
   Oakar said she raised the case of Terry Anderson, a hostage since
March 1985. Anderson, an Associated Press correspondent in Lebanon
when he was kidnapped and the longest-held hostage, is a native of
Lorain, Ohio, which is near Oakar's Cleveland district.
   During a trip to the Middle East, Oakar arranged the wide-ranging
session with Assad. Also attending the meeting were Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., and Edward Djerejian, the U.S. ambassador to Syria.
Specter's office said he was attending inaugural events and could
not be reached for comment immediately.
   But Oakar, who has an Arab-American heritage, said she was
pleased with the reaction from Assad when the discussion turned to
the plight of Anderson.
   ``I felt that he was extremely firm in his commitment to help
Terry,'' she said. Reading from her notes on the meeting, Oakar
quoted Assad as saying, ``I want to say to the family that I will
help.''
   The hostages are thought to be held by pro-Iranian militants in
the southern suburbs of Beirut. Syria considers itself the main
power broker in Lebanon, though fighting between rival militias has
put pressure on Syria's ability to influence events over the last
few months.
   The prospect of a Syrian-sponsored settlement in Lebanon, a
country where Moslems and Christians have fought for 13 years, is
not considered bright in the near future.
   Oakar said Assad did not provide any details about how he might
work for the hostages' freedom. However, he said he viewed the
hostages as a humanitarian issue rather than a political issue.
   The Syrian leader said the ``whole hostage question is a human
question,'' Oakar said.
   But Assad is obviously a player in the region, Oakar said. ``He
could use his influence. ... He obviously has occasions for
dialogue,'' she said.
   She said Assad stressed the hostages were a sensitive issue and
he would avoid doing anything that might harm them.

   The number of American servicemen who died last
year on active duty fell to its lowest total in more than a decade,
a new Pentagon report shows.
   The annual report found that military personnel did a better job
during the year of avoiding training and off-duty accidents. The
number of deaths attributed to illness or disease also declined,
although the number of suicides rose slightly.
   All told, the Defense Department charted 1,833 deaths in fiscal
1988 from all causes among the roughly 2.1 million men and women on
active duty.
   That total reflects a continuing peace-time trend toward falling
death rates. For example, during the five previous years, the number
of military deaths totaled 1,990 in fiscal 1987, 2,240 in fiscal
1986; 2,017 in fiscal 1985; 2,313 in fiscal 1984, and 2,204 in
fiscal 1983.
   The fiscal 1986 total was swollen by the deaths of 248 soldiers
in a chartered airplane crash in Gander, Newfoundland. The fiscal
1984 total jumped due to the ``hostile fire'' deaths of servicemen
in the terrorist bombing of a Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon,
and casualties during the invasion of Grenada.
   The 1,990 figure in fiscal 1987 was the lowest total charted at
least since fiscal 1977. Consolidated service figures for prior
years are not readily available.
   The latest report, consisting of 172 pages of statistics, was
released by the Pentagon on Thursday. It covers fiscal 1988, or the
12-month period from Oct. 1, 1987, to Sept. 30, 1988, and is
entitled ``Worldwide U.S. Active Duty Military Personnel
Casualties.''
   The report lists five deaths attributed to hostile action during
the year.
   Three of them involved Navy sailors or officers who were killed
in terrorist bombing incidents in Italy, Spain and Greece. The other
two were Marine aviators killed when their Cobra helicopter gunship
was shot down last April during fighting in the Persian Gulf.
   Although the report does not detail specific deaths, it does
divide fatalities among various categories in such a way as to
identify trends.
   For example, the study found that 1,083 servicemen lost their
lives accidentally in fiscal 1988 _ a decline compared to the 1,153
reported in fiscal 1987.
   Of the accidental deaths, seven were attributed to alcohol or
drug abuse in fiscal 1988, about the same as the six reported in
fiscal 1987. The number of deaths attributed to aircraft accidents
totaled 142 in fiscal 1988, down from the 173 reported the year
before.
   The leading cause of accidental deaths continued to be mishaps
involving cars, trucks and other vehicles. Of the total 1,083
accidental deaths during the year, 778 were attributed to ``vehicle
loss or accident.''
   There were 789 such vehicular deaths in fiscal 1987.
   Deaths attributed to illness or disease also declined with 314
reported in fiscal 1988 compared to 394 the preceeding year. Heart
attacks remained by far the predominant cause of illness-related
death, with 214 in fiscal 1988 compared to 249 in fiscal 1987.
   The latest report charted an increase in the number of suicides
among active-duty personnel, rising from 247 in fiscal 1987 to 257
last year. The number of homicides remained static _ 95 in fiscal
1988 compared to 98 in fiscal 1987.
   Continuing a trend of many years, the study found that service
members committing suicide relied almost exclusively on the use of a
gun. Of the 257 suicides committed during the year, 159 involved
``gunshot or small arms fire.''

<HEAD>Druse Militia Chief Calls For Waite Release</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the militia that guarded
hostage negotiator Terry Waite before he was kidnapped appealed on
Thursday for the release of the Anglican Church envoy.
   Walid Jumblatt called for Waite's release during an interview
broadcast by Lebanon's state television on the first anniversary of
Waite's capture.
   ``I do not think that Terry Waite is that big a spy. We should
emerge from this whirlpool (of hostage taking),'' he said without
elaborating.
   Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party, the strongest Moslem
militia in Lebanon's 12-year-old civil war, was guarding the
Anglican Church emissary before he vanished Jan. 20, 1987.
   The Druse militia leader has accused the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, of holding Waite but the Shiite
fundamentalist group has denied it. No group has claimed
responsibility.
   Waite, 49, was on his fifth mission to Beirut to seek the release
of foreign hostages. He was last spotted after leaving a hotel in
Moslem west Beirut to meet with Shiite kidnappers.
   He had told his Druse bodyguards he did not want them to escort
him to the clandestine meeting, whose site he did not disclose.
   Fifteen Western foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including nine
Americans, most of them believed held by Shiites loyal to Iran.
   Longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   When it comes to the federal deficit, George
Bush's chosen budget director, Richard Darman, sees the problem
differently than President Reagan does.
   At his confirmation hearing before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee on Thursday, Darman was asked whether he agreed
with Reagan's characterization of an ``iron triangle'' consisting of
Congress, the news media and special interest groups as the culprits
for the government's huge budget imbalances.
   ``It doesn't sound like a complete explanation,'' he said after a
long pause. ``I think we probably need something larger than a
triangle.''
   ``Like a pentagon?'' asked Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the
committee's chairman.
   ``It would have to be at least a hexagon,'' he said. ``But
certainly these three would make any short list.''
   Glenn asked Darman if he believed the White House might also be
included in any compilation of those responsible for the red ink.
   ``That would probably make the list too,'' he said.
   Reagan made his remarks in a speech Dec. 13.
   Darman spent most of the 1980s working in the Reagan
administration. He is expected to receive Senate confirmation to be
director of the Office of Management and Budget, perhaps as early as
Wednesday.

   When the presidential torch is passed Friday
to George Bush, the transition will be quite unlike the inaugural
experience of the nation's second president, one historian says.
   ``When John Adams was inaugurated, he was furious,'' said Thomas
O. Kelly, chairman of American Studies at Siena College. ``Nobody
was talking to him; they were all going up to George Washington to
say good-bye.''
   There was even a ``good-bye'' party for Washington from which
Adams ``was frozen out.''
   ``It wasn't Washington's fault. I think they just forgot to
invite him (Adams),'' said Kelly.
   That snafu would repeat itself four years later, in 1801, when
Thomas Jefferson was inaugurated. ``Adams wasn't invited to that
ball either.''
   A bitter campaign between Herbert Hoover and Franklin D.
Roosevelt left an icy barrier between the two at Roosevelt's
inauguration in 1933.
   ``FDR had been elected on a pledge to maintain a balanced
budget,'' Kelly said, adding that Roosevelt's campaign charges of
mismanagement created the iceberg.
   The worst inaugural ball? That dubious honor goes to Ulysses S.
Grant after his election to a second term in 1873.
   That ball, with about $40,000 worth of food (and in those days,
the average day laborer earned between $400 and $500 a year), was
held in a temporary building. But the weather contributed high wind
and freezing temperatures.
   ``There was no heat (in the building) so everyone went home
early,'' said Kelly.
   While the electronic news media has been kind to President
Reagan, they would have been ``destructive'' for the country's 16th
president. ``Abraham Lincoln had a bad speaking voice,'' Kelly
explained.
   He added that the sight of FDR's wheelchair also may have
tarnished Roosevelt's popularity.

<HEAD>Koop Has No Great Fear of Back-Alley Abortionists if Court Overturns
Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said Thursday
he has no great fear of back-alley abortionists if the Supreme Court
overturns its 1973 decision legalizing abortions.
   The National Abortion Federation criticized Koop for diminishing
the risks involved in illegal abortions.
   Koop, interviewed on ``CBS This Morning,'' said the number of
illegal abortion deaths was exaggerated by pro-choice advocates when
the high court issued its Roe vs. Wade decision.
   ``The greatest number of deaths ever in one year was 373,'' said
Koop, an opponent of abortion. ``That's a terrible number, but it
wasn't 10,000.''
   Koop said, ``That doesn't mean that there's not going to be a
black market, and we don't have problems on our hands.'' But he
added that ``with the techniques that are being used by abortionists
now, those same techniques will be used in the future, and they are
safer.''
   He also said that if the Supreme Court returns control of
abortions to the states, ``it will open Pandora's box, because we'll
have 50 problems instead of one.''
   The National Abortion Federation said forcing women to seek
illegal abortions would create a serious public health problem.
   ``Whenever medicine goes underground, complications and deaths
rise. Not only would we have a Pandora's box of legal issues but
we'd have a Pandora's box of health issues we haven't seen in the
past 16 years,'' said Alice Kirkman, a spokeswoman for the
federation.
   The group agreed with Koop's assessment that giving control of
abortions to states would create problems.
   Koop said if the decision is overturned, ``it will go back to
pre-1973 where certain states will opt to be very liberal about
abortions and others will clamp down. ... And what it meant was that
abortions were available on demand to people who could get to those
states but they were essentially inaccessible to those'' who could
not.
   Koop angered many anti-abortion activists recently when he
decided not to issue a report requested by President Reagan on the
health impact of abortion.
   In a letter to the president earlier this month he said that
among Reagan's advisers, ``it was a foregone conclusion that the
negative health effects of abortion on women were so overwhelming
that the evidence would force the reversal of Roe vs. Wade.''
   But Koop said in the letter that no such scientific evidence
exists. He said that while anecdotal reports are plentiful to
support both sides, ``individual cases cannot be used to reach
scientifically sound conclusions.''
   The Supreme Court last week agreed to hear an appeal that the
Justice Department wants the court to use as a vehicle for
overturning its landmark 1973 decision.
   Nancy Broff of the National Abortion Rights Action League said
``there are not good figures'' for pre-1973 abortion deaths, but she
said Koop's estimate is ``extremely low.''
   She cited research that estimated as many as one death for every
100 illegal abortions. Other research said that in 1955 between
200,000 and 1.2 million illegal abortions were performed in the
United States.
   ``And that doesn't take into account women who are mutilated and
who suffered long-term health consequences'' from illegal abortions,
Broff said.

<HEAD>Another `Contact' with PLO Disclosed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department disclosed Thursday another
U.S. meeting had been held with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, but no details of the ``contact'' in Tunis were
released.
   ``I am not going to go into any specific agenda items,''
department spokesman Charles E. Redman said of the meeting. He also
refused to release the text of a statement in which PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat threatened to pump 10 bullets into the chest of anyone
who tried to stem the Palestinian unrest on the Israeli-held West
Bank.
   The Reagan administration broke a 13-year ban on U.S. talks with
the PLO last month. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said the
decision was based on a public statement by Arafat renouncing
terrorism in all forms and accepting Israel's right to exist.
   Robert Pelletreau, the U.S. ambassador to Tunis, was designated
the only official U.S. channel to the PLO, although it was revealed
later that restrictions had been lifted on other American officials
meeting socially with PLO representatives.
   Redman said the latest ``contact'' was a meeting Tuesday in Tunis
between Pelletreau and a PLO representative. He said it was not like
the initial meeting in mid-December, but was ``more in the nature of
an informal contact.''
   The spokesman declined to say whether the bombing of a Pan Am
jumbo jet Dec. 21 was discussed. A total of 270 passengers, crew
members and people on the ground died in the crash in Scotland.
   The PLO has offered to assist in the bombing investigation. PLO
representatives have been quoted as suggesting Israel was behind the
attack.
   Redman refused to say whether the PLO had made the allegation
directly to U.S. officials or which side initiated the latest Tunis
meeting.
   ``I'm just not going to go into the agenda,'' he said. ``As this
develops, I don't think you'll find it unusual that there may be
contacts of one kind or another, initiated by one side or the other,
as this process develops. The kind of things you will know about
will be the real meetings, the real dialogue.''
   He added: ``I don't want to set the precedent of going into the
agenda.''
   Redman's disclosure of another U.S.-PLO meeting came in response
to a reporter's question.
   On Wednesday, again in response to a question, he said the State
Department had obtained a tape recording in which Arafat had said:
``Whoever thinks of stopping the intefadah before it achieve its
goals, I will give him 10 bullets in the chest.''
   Intefadah is the Arabic word for the violent, 13-month uprising
by Palestinian inhabitants of the West Bank and Gaza.
   Redman said Wednesday that Arafat has since denied he intended
any threat against Elias Freij, the mayor of Bethlehem who is
considered a moderate Palestinian and was the purported target.
   Redman gave no indication the United States was reconsidering its
decision to hold talks with the PLO. Assistant Secretary of State
Richard W. Murphy said last month the talks would be suspended if
Arafat reneged on his renunciation of terrorism.
   Redman refused to provide the text of Arafat's entire statement.
   ``I read the particularly relevant part yesterday,'' he said.
   Asked about the uprising itself, the spokesman said, ``We do not
consider the intefadah terrorism.'' Redman also reiterated the U.S.
call for ``everybody to refrain from violence and to work for
peace.''
   Elaboratoring, the U.S. official said ``individual acts would
have to be evaluated.''

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand of France
met on Thursday with 12 Bulgarian human rights activists who asked
for Western help in relaxing their country's rigid communist system.
   The group invited to have breakfast with Mitterrand at the French
ambassador's residence included scientists, writers, artists and
journalists, some of whom belong to the Communist Party.
   Most are among the approximately 150 members of the Club for the
Support of Glasnost amd Perestroika, formed in November to promote
the economic and social reform being pursued in the Soviet Union by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Alexei Chelutko, a 65-year-old academician, delivered a letter to
Mitterrand that described official harassment of club members.
   At a news conference with Tolor Zhivkov, the Bulgarian president
and party chief, at the end of his 36-hour visit to Bulgaria, the
French president said:
   ``I would like to thank Mr. Zhivkov and the Bulgarian leadership
because I was also able to meet those with different opinions, those
who approve and those who don't approve.''
   Asked by a Bulgarian television reporter what he thought of some
French newspaper reports on Bulgaria and its recent crackdown on
dissidents, he said: ``The press is free and this sometimes creates
inconveniences, but less than the absence of freedom.''
   Rabotnichesko Delo, the party newspaper, carried an article
Thursday attacking some French reports on harassment of dissidents.
   Authorities detained about two dozen activists last week in
Plovdiv. They were released after French diplomatic intervention but
put under house arrest, French officials said.
   Zhivkov said in an interview with the French daily Le Monde
published Wednesday that 25 people had been arrested. He described
them as criminals.
   A French reporter asked him Thursday when his government would
allow Bulgarians free travel to the West. Zhivkov replied: ``No
problem. We signed the document in Vienna and they will be able to
come and go as they please.''
   In his speech at a state banquet Wednesday evening, Mitterrand
made a strong call for greater human rights with the declaration:
``National sovereignty, representative democracy, separation of
powers, freedom and respect for individuals; these values have lost
nothing of their reality.''
   Nikolai Vassiliev, a science professor who attended the meeting
with Mitterrand, told reporters: ``We discussed the problems in our
social development. We want our society to become more humanized and
to find its place in the European house mentioned by Gorbachev.''
   He quoted Mitterrand as telling his visitors ``France cannot help
solve our problem directly but would do its best indirectly.''
Vassiliev said French media could help by publicizing his group's
activities.
   French sources said the intellectuals told Mitterrand they felt
Gorbachev-style reform was the road Bulgaria should take.
   Chelutko, who presented the letter, told reporters the club was
not illegal and membership in it and Communist Party were
compatible, but said police persecution had begun.
   In the letter to Mitterrand, he quoted Zhivkov as saying the club
would be left alone if it did not violate the law, but added:
``After our founding declaration and our meeting, the club's
activity was completely paralyzed by police prosecutors and party
organs.''
   After talking with the club members, Mitterrand went to Sofia
University and answered questions for 80 minutes from about 1,000
students packed into an auditorium.
   The first question was: ``What do you think about democracy and
human rights in Bulgaria?''
   Mitterrand said he could not judge because he had arrived only
Wednesday, but added to loud applause: ``What is interesting is not
my response, but your question.''

   The Rev. Jerry Falwell on Thursday praised
President-elect Bush as an experienced manager whose administration
is likely to continue the Reagan legacy and will not bring any ``bad
surprises'' for the country's conservative movement.
   ``I am convinced in my heart that George Bush by osmosis, just as
Ronald Reagan 30 years ago, has moved from _ he would say the
center, I would say a little left of center _ to where he is
today,'' Falwell told a convention of Students for America, a
conservative youth group.
   ``And I think where he is today is clearly where Ronald Reagan is
today,'' the Moral Majority founder added.
   Falwell said he considers Bush a better manager than Reagan.
   ``Ronald Reagan, the visionary we needed eight years ago, laid
the foundation for it, he gave us the dream,'' Falwell said. ``But I
see George Bush as a hands-on, very experienced manager.''
   He said everything he had heard from Bush both in public and
private ``tells me that we don't have any surprises upcoming. I
don't think any of us are going to be disappointed.''
   Falwell expressed satisfaction with the health of the
conservative movement, saying that today more young people
``understand the bankruptcy of the liberal, socialistic point of
view that almost dominated this country 20 years ago.''
   ``All over Washington today, conservative young people and older
people are here celebrating the Reagan revolution and praying that
the agenda will continue,'' Falwell said.

diplomat.
   Standing before the throng in the State Department lobby, Shultz
placed his arm around his wife, Obie, and said, ``We came as a
package deal. We leave as a package.''
   In a wavering voice, Shultz praised his State Department
colleagues and said it was a ``tremendous privilege to be a part of
this family.''
   ``We just appreciate so much the partnership we've had with all
of you,'' he said.
   As Shultz headed out the door, a five-piece Marine band played
``California, Here I Come.'' Shultz has a home in the San Francisco
area and will fly there on Friday. He plans to resume teaching at
Stanford.
   Shultz flew 880,000 miles during overseas travels since July
1982. He served longer than his five immediate predecessors. The
last secretary of state with a longer tenure than Shultz was Dean
Rusk, 1961-69.

<HEAD>Blacks Question Police Use of Lethal Force</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Experts say Miami police have a good policy and
training program on the use of deadly force, but blacks claim there
are problems with the way it is practiced.
   ``Being a black man in the city of Miami is a dangerous
occupation,'' said Ronnie Hardman, a resident of Overtown where two
nights of rioting followed the fatal shooting of a fleeing, unarmed
black motorcyclist by a Hispanic officer.
   Miami gets high marks for its training of officers and its policy
on the use of lethal force. The amount of training is well above
average and the department policy on the use of firearms is
considered a national model.
   ``It is a policy that by and large tells police officers not to
use deadly force unless in defense of life and spells out when not
to use your gun,'' said James Fyfe, a criminologist at American
University and an expert in the use of deadly force.
   Clement Anthony Lloyd, 23, was fatally shot in the head by
Officer William Lozano on Monday. Lloyd's passenger, 24-year-old
Allen Blanchard, died the following day of injuries suffered when
the motorcycle crashed. Both men were black.
   Some witnesses claim Lozano fired after the motorcycle passed
him. But Lozano's attorney said Lloyd was driving toward his client
and that the officer shot in self-defense. ``Officer Lozano believed
his life was threatened,'' said Roy Black.
   Investigations are under way by the FBI, state attorney's office
and the city's department of internal affairs. The city also agreed
to set up an independent review board of police and Overtown
residents.
   For many blacks, the incident was the latest in a long line of
clashes with police that has resulted in an us-against-them
mentality.
   ``The police in this area shoot first and ask questions later
when it comes to blacks,'' said Hilda McPhee, 30.
   In 1980, the acquittal of four white Miami officers on
manslaughter charges in the beating death of a 33-year-old black man
touched off three days of rioting in Liberty City that left 18
people dead, 400 injured and some $100 million in damage.
   In 1982, rioting erupted in Overtown after the fatal shooting of
a black man by a Cuban-born police officer. Million of dollars in
damages resulted. More violence followed in 1984 after the officer
was acquitted.
   Miller Dawkins, the Miami City Commission's only black member,
said blacks don't condone the latest rioting but added, ``I have a
problem with a policeman who shoots a man for a traffic violation.''
   Raymond Lang, a police spokesman, said department policy
prohibits officers from shooting at moving vehicles ``unless it
poses an imminent danger to their life or someone else's.''
   But Lang said policy is sometimes hard to follow when an officer
feels threatened.
   ``You can teach someone in the classroom the principles of deadly
force, but when they're out in the street and the adrenaline starts
to pump and things are unfolding ...,'' he said.
   All South Florida police officers attend a regional training
institute where they receive a minimum of 800 hours of basic
training, nearly double that of some other jurisdictions, said Jim
Stinchcomb, director of the Southeast Florida Institute of Criminal
Justice.
   However, Kevin Parsons, a consultant in Appleton, Wis., who
designs training programs for local and federal law enforcement
agencies, said training too often emphasizes the use of guns without
offering alternatives.
   ``Far more often I see officers who did not have the skills to
cope rather than officers who intentionally went out of their way to
abuse someone because of race,'' he said.
   Sgt. Mike Mazur, a 19-year veteran of the force, said police are
likely to continue using deadly force.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind police officers have to use
force,'' he said. ``To chastise an officer for acting is wrong. Do
you expect him to go down with the scum of the earth?''

<HEAD>Site Of Deer-Reduction Battle Shows High Incidence Of Lyme Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State wildlife experts say a study that found a
neighborhood with the highest concentration of Lyme disease ever
documented justifies their effort to allow hunters to thin the
number of deer living in a refuge nearby.
   But animal rights activists who fought hard to stop controlled
deer hunting on the reserve say the study, reported in Thursday's
New England Journal of Medicine, hasn't changed their minds.
   The study recorded the spread of the disease beginning about 1980
among 190 people who lived along a road connecting the town of
Ipswich with the Crane Memorial Reservation and Wildlife Refuge,
which was overrun with tick-infested deer.
   ``We feel that it provides evidence that we know what we're
talking about and the things that we predicted came true in terms of
not hunting,'' said Steve Williams, deer project leader for the
Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.
   Lyme disease is caused by bacteria carried by blood-sucking ticks
that feed on white-tailed deer and field mice. The ticks also
sometimes attach themselves to people and spread the bacteria.
   State and reservation officials planned to begin controlled
hunting to reduce the deer population on the 1,400-acre, oceanside
reserve in 1983, but hunting was delayed until 1985 after animal
rights activists protested.
   Although the threat of Lyme disease was a concern, state
officials were chiefly occupied with overbrowsing in the refuge,
accompanying erosion problems and starvation among the deer,
Williams said.
   Activists contended there was enough food for the deer and also
said that if the deer were starving, they should be fed or moved
rather than hunted.
   The Lyme disease study found the epidemic peaked in 1984 and
1985. Although people there continue to catch Lyme disease, experts
believe that insecticides, limited hunting in the reserve and
increased awareness of ticks have helped diminish the disease.
   The disease can cause a variety of seemingly unrelated symptoms,
including a rash, headaches, facial paralysis, heart complications
and arthritis. It can be cured if treated early with penicillin.
   Researchers said the study shows how rapidly the disease can
spread once it arrives in a community that has lots of deer.
   But the study does not directly link deer-reduction to a decrease
in the disease, said Rob Deblinger, a wildlife ecologist who worked
on the report. He said researchers are still collecting data on
whether there is a direct correlation.
   ``That's speculative at this point,'' said Deblinger, who works
for a group called Trustees of Reservation which oversees the
preserve.
   Wildlife activists said they aren't convinced by the study.
   ``It's prevention that's making any kind of a difference because
people are searching for these ticks,'' said Dorothy Checchi-O'Brien
of Plymouth. ``All it's (hunting) done is to allow hunters to have
some fun over there.''

<HEAD>Excerpts Of Statement On Political And Union Freedoms</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist party Central Committee on
Thursday released its statement on political and union freedoms,
which allows for legalizing the independent Solidarity trade union.
Here are excerpts from the statement, translated by the official PAP
news agency:
   The Central Committee considers it necessary to define a new
formula of shaping political pluralism. ... The formula of political
pluralism should reflect differentiation and multitude of interests
and political orientations as well as beliefs of particular social
groups and circles, be conducive to solving contradictions and
disputes with no harm to the supreme values of the nation and law
abidingly _ within state structures and not against them.
   The Central Committee confirms the readiness of the Polish United
Workers Party (the Communist party) to conduct dialogue and search
for forms of agreement with any constructive political force if the
latter _ irrespective of political orientation and ideological
inspiration _ observes the country's constitutional order and
regards the ... prosperous future of the nation and the state as the
supreme value.
   To promote these principles and values, it is possible and
necessary to cooperate in materializing the tasks that unite, rather
than divide, society and serve well the solving of Polish
civilizational and economic problems.
   The ... Central Committee sees the need and the possibility to
include constructive opposition in the political system.
   The ... Central Committee comes out for strong and independent
trade union movement. ... We base our attitude towards the principle
of trade union pluralism on the assumption that ``the trade unions
will be such as the working people wish them to be.''
   While taking into account the progress made in the sphere of
political dialogue and democratization of life in Poland as well as
the requirements of the country's development, the Central Committee
comes out in favor of lifting _ in conditions of national agreement
_ of restrictions on creating new trade unions, provided that the
new unions:
   Abide by the constitutional and legislative order and trade union
statutes.
   Act in favor of economic development, while being aware that
production of goods is the condition for distribution.
   Rely on financial sources in tune with the law in force in Poland
and the principle of loyalty to their own state.
   Counteract attempts to violate social peace or to undermine the
stability of the state.
   The organizational shape of trade unions is an open question. It
requires discussion by all sides concerned.
   It is also at the round table that conditions, ways and timetable
should be agreed concerning the introduction of trade union
pluralism and opening up the way to creating new trade unions,
including ``Solidarity,'' which in the name of unity of interests of
the working world would set up a joint representation vis-a-vis the
economic administration in work establishments.
   The Central Committee calls on all Polish United Workers Party
members and candidate members to actively support this stand.

<HEAD>Task Force Formed As New Orleans Sees 18th Homicide Of '89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jewelry store employee was murdered Thursday
just as the mayor was announcing the appointment of a task force to
look into the wave of killings that have averaged one a day since
the year began.
   Police said the female employee was shot in the back of the head,
apparently just after she opened the jewelry store at 9 a.m.,
becoming the 18th homicide victim in 19 days.
   Display cases were ransacked and police suspected armed robbery.
   Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, Police Chief Warren Woodfork and Coroner
Frank Minyard blame drugs for most of the homicides.
   Cocaine was found in the blood of eight of the first 17 victims,
said Minyard. Eight of the victims had police records and nine died
of wounds from machine-gun type weapons that more and more drug
dealers in New Orleans are carrying, the coroner said.
   Barthelemy said his task force, made up of business and civic
leaders, was part of an effort to draw the community together in the
fight against drugs and drug-related violence.
   ``Law-abiding citizens must come to the forefront,'' he said.
``We must take a stand that we're not going to accept drugs in this
community.''

<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told
reporters on Thursday that any agreement to legalize his banned
union movement must preserve its independence.
   Walesa said he was being cautious before responding to the
Communist Party's new position on trade unions and would have no
answer to the party document until Friday, after he examined it.
   He appeared upbeat and hopeful, however, as he addressed a packed
room of reporters and supporters in St. Brygida's Church in his home
city of Gdansk.
   Walesa spoke a few hours before a news conference in Warsaw by
Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski at which Jaruzelski unveiled
the party's plan to legalize Solidarity under conditions to be
negotiated.
   ``Tomorrow I will try to say something, when I see what it's
like,'' said Walesa, winner of the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize and a
founder of Solidarity, the first free trade union movement in the
East bloc.
   Solidarity was suspended when martial law was imposed in Poland
in December 1981 and was outlawed in 1982.
   Walesa said that under no condition would he accept an offer that
deprives Solidarity of its freedom of action.
   ``After all the experiences, losses and struggles, we cannot give
up our independence or sovereignty,'' he said.
   ``If we blow it here, other people will have to deal with the
same problem again. I don't want my son or his generation to live
through such things again, where it all accumulates, rots and then
explodes.
   ``We cannot destroy this chance (by conceding too much), but at
the same time we should not struggle for some ambitious details.''
   Legalization, he said, has become increasingly important because
of poor economic conditions and deteriorating public moods.
   The labor leader noted that a scattering of strikes took place in
recent weeks and said he heard more strikes might be declared as
early as Monday.
   He said that ``despair (may bring) ... desperate acts.''
   ``I treat Soldarity's revival as very important, very urgent and
very timely _ an independent Solidarity without any confinements in
freedoms,'' Walesa went on.
   ``I believe that Solidarity will be wise and reasonable, that it
will understand what's necessary. But I won't allow anybody to
deprive it of its independence.''
   Walesa said he saw some positive developments among authorities.
   ``Now everybody is convinced that Poland really needs agreement
based on principles of freedom and pluralism, with as few
limitations and confinements as possible and as much faith in
people's wisdom as possible,'' he said.
   He minimized the risk to the government of permitting legal
operation of his union movement.
   ``This is not the time when workers destroy machines or burn
them. Today workers are much more sophisticated and they can
understand other's reasons. But they must themselves be understood
first,'' he said.
   ``Working people in Poland are able to take responsibility for
development in a civilized and not destructive way. I deeply believe
it.''
   When pressed about his assessments of a Communist Party plenum
this week, Walesa would make only general comments.
   ``It seems to me that it provides too much to die on and too
little to live on,'' he said. ``It is a lot for this party. ... But
it is too little for social demands.''
   He said it is easier for authorities to talk to an organization
than to a shouting mob.
   Walesa continued: ``Conditions in Poland give justification to
every one of us to strike ... because the situation is so bad. But
reason shows that this leads nowhere.
   ``I think that the opinion in Poland is similar on all sides. .
.. We have to create condition for good work for everyone in the
country. At the same time we have to respect their independence.
   ``This is the only way we can develop and this seems to be
understood.''

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers killed a teen-ager suspected of
inciting stone-throwers, and 38 Palestinians were reported wounded
Thursday, two days after Israel imposed tougher measures in the
occupied territories.
   West Bank residents closed shops and offices to protest the
sudden increase in the number of Palestinians shot to death in the
uprising against nearly 22 years of Israeli rule.
   The teen-ager shot to death in the Gaza Strip was the 14th
Palestinian killed by soldiers in a week, bringing the total to at
least 363 since the rebellion began Dec. 8, 1987. Fifteen Israelis
also have been slain.
   Soldiers are allowed to fire plastic and rubber bullets more
freely under the new army policy, which also provides harsher
punishment for people throwing stones.
   Tougher sentences were given Thursday, Israel radio reported.
   It said two Palestinians from Ramallah in the West Bank received
sentences of 16 months and 18 months in jail for throwing stones,
which caused no damage, at an Israeli vehicle. Previously, the usual
sentence for stone-throwing was four to five months.
   The new policy has drawn criticism from the United States and
left-wing legislators in Israel.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat said Israel is ``forgetting that our
people had decided from the beginning to continue the uprising until
the end of the occupation, so let us have more confrontation against
the Zionist occupation and the fascist hordes of murderous
settlers.''
   ``In our steadfastness and faith, the enemy faces its inevitable
dilemma, from which the way out is the retreat of its forces from
the occupied lands,'' he said in a statement issued in Cyprus by the
PLO news agency Wafa.
   Small groups of Israeli activists from the Peace Now movement and
Yesh Gvul, which represents soldiers refusing to serve in the
territories, held silent vigils outside the Defense Ministry in Tel
Aviv and government offices in Jerusalem.
   ``Daddy, what do you do in the occupied territories?'' their
posters read.
   An army spokeswoman said 18-year-old Mohammed Dahaise of Gaza
City, was killed ``after he was identified as an inciter'' of a
stone-throwing attack on soldiers in the nearby Shati refugee camp.
   The spokeswoman said Dahaise died on the spot. Arab hospital
officials said he was shot in the head.
   Israel has controlled the territories since the 1967 Middle East
War, when it captured Gaza from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan.
The occupied lands are home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   In the West Bank village of Arraba, 10 Palestinians suffered
gunshot wounds Thursday in a clash set off by a demonstration
against an alleged Israeli collaborator, Arab reports said.
   Arab witnesses said Arraba villagers stoned the home of a
Palestinian suspected of collaborating and that he emerged with a
pistol, wounding four of the stone-throwers.
   Israeli troops arrived and opened fire, wounding six more
villagers, the witnesses said.
   Arab reporters said three villagers were wounded in a later
confrontation in the area, prompting the army to impose a curfew and
confine the village's 5,000 residents to their homes.
   Another army spokesman generally confirmed the account but would
say only that several villagers were wounded.
   Arab reports said 25 other Palestinians were wounded in clashes
in the occupied lands Thursday. But the army spokeman confirmed
eight injuries from other clashes in the occupied territories and
said it was checking the other reports.
   Meanwhile, a new group called the Palestinian Popular Army issued
a leaflet urging more attacks on the Israeli army and the more than
70,000 Jewish settlers who have built enclaves in the territories.
   The group said it was allied with the uprising's underground
leaders who generally support the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In another development, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
unveiled what he called ``a personal program'' for a peace
settlement in the occupied lands, Israel radio reported Thursday.
   It said Rabin proposed a three-to-six month halt in the uprising
followed by elections to choose Palestinian representatives ``who
agree to negotiate a peace solution.''
   He said the territories should be placed in a federation with
Jordan or Israel, the radio reported.
   The defense minister was also quoted as saying that Jewish
settlements in the occupied territories would not be uprooted and
responsibility for security will remain in the hands of the Israeli
army.

   Hundreds of supporters of the banned
Independent Students Organization rallied in several cities on
Thursday to demand legalization of the group, state-run media and an
opposition spokesman said.
   Students marched through the cities of Cracow, Lublin and
Wroclaw, the official news agency PAP said.
   In Cracow, a delegation of students was received by Jozef
Gajewicz, a Communist Party first secretary. Gajewicz talked to the
group about the results of this week's party meeting, which called
for greater political and union freedoms.
   The student group was founded during the period of Solidarity
trade union's legal existence in 1980-81 and was banned after the
martial law crackdown in Dec. 1981. The organization went
underground, but last fall began an open campaign to obtain legal
registration.
   Zygmunt Lenyk, an opposition spokesman in Cracow, said the group
dispersed peacefully and there were no arrests. There were no
reports of arrests in the two other cities.

<HEAD>Joint Custody Settlement in Case of Youngest College Graduate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A battle over 12-year-old mathematics
whiz Adragon De Mello _ the world's youngest college graduate _ has
been settled, with his parents agreeing to joint custody.
   Cathy Gunn and Agustin De Mello came to terms Wednesday as Santa
Cruz County sought to have Adragon named a ward of the court, said
the father's lawyer, Paul B. Meltzer. The county dropped its action,
the lawyer said.
   Adragon last year graduated at age 11 from the University of
California at Santa Cruz, earning a spot in the Guinness Book of
World Records.
   The boy was placed in a foster home in September after his mother
alleged that the boy and his father had a suicide pact. Since
November, Adragon has been living with his mother, while De Mello
had supervised visits.
   The boy's father was arrested for investigation of felony child
endangerment, but no charges were filed, and he denied forming a
suicide pact.
   Meltzer said the settlement allows each parent to spend
``significant time'' with the boy and calls for no contact between
the parents.
   Gordon Salisbury, Adragon's lawyer, said the boy is ``very happy
the way the custody is structured.''
   ``I hope my son is happy,'' said his father. ``I'm happy with the
result.''
   Neither the mother nor her attorney would comment.

<TEXT>
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle on Thursday
borrowed a line from Winston Churchill about surviving an attack in
what seemed to be a reference to the controversy over his nomination
last year.
   ``Winston Churchill once said that there's nothing more
exhilarating than to be shot at without result,'' Quayle told a
group gathered in the lobby of the National Museum of American
History.
   ``Here we are, ready to go, to do the work that you and the
people of America said they wanted us to do,'' he said as costumed
members of the U.S. Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps stood behind
him.
   The remarks seemed to refer to the GOP's November victory despite
the campaign uproar over Quayle's experience, military record and
other matters.
   He spent the afternoon shaking hands with thousands of ``our best
friends'' at the museum. An estimated 13,000 supporters paid $20
each to see Quayle, his wife, Marilyn, and his parents, and each of
the visitors received a commemorative medallion etched with his
picture.
   Quayle elaborated on the Churchill remark before a later
audience, saying it was ``rather appropriate to my particular case.''
   He arose at 5:30 a.m. and appeared on morning television talk
shows on CBS and NBC, then stopped at a downtown fast-food
restaurant for breakfast.
   After an afternoon of receptions, Quayle planned to attend the
Indiana Society ball, then the inaugural gala and other festivities
lasting until around midnight.
   Earlier, Quayle spoke to 8,000 high school students and expressed
regret about his own missed opportunities as student.
   ``As one looks back at life, I'll be the first to admit I wish I
had taken education more seriously,'' Quayle said.
   ``Seriousness about education is something, to be honest with
you, I wish I had done differently,'' he added.
   The former Indiana senator has acknowledged before that he was
not the most serious student in his class but declined in the fall
campaign to release his college grade transcripts.
   His selection by Bush to the Republican ticket in August sparked
controversy over his service in the National Guard, which allowed
him to avoid military service in Vietnam.
   Quayle received polite applause from the youthful crowd of high
school juniors and seniors that filled the Washington, D.C., Armory.
The students, who earlier in the day were addressed by
President-elect Bush, came from more than 700 schools nationwide.
   Quayle spoke of the importance of family, traditional values and
hard work.
   ``Hard work has dignity, and let me tell you, hard work has
rewards,'' said Quayle, who is among the heirs to a family newspaper
fortune. ``... Those rewards are opportunities.''
   He said the new administration will ``march forward and crusade
for greater opportunity.''
   ``I've known George Bush now for over 10 years,'' Quayle said.
``We're together on a day-to-day basis, and I can tell you that his
commitment to helping people, and particularly to helping people
that have not had the opportunities that he had or I had or you had
is not only genuine but he has a deep compassion to helping these
people out.''
   Quayle was introduced by his niece, 17-year-old Jennifer Tucker
of Paoli, Ind.

   Blowing, drifting snow cut visibility Thursday over parts of
North Dakota and Minnesota, and snow showers were scattered over
parts of Michigan and northern New England.
   Rain fell across the Gulf Coast.
   Wind reaching 35 mph, with stronger gusts, combined with as much
as 2 and 3 feet of snow on the ground to produce blowing and
drifting snow over northwestern and west-central Minnesota and
eastern North Dakota, the National Weather Service said.
   Overnight snowfall across Minnesota included 6 inches near Cook,
south of the border city of International Falls, 4 inches at Lutsen
and International Falls, and 3 inches at Baudette, Roseau and Winton.
   Snow showers spread over northeastern Minnesota and Upper
Michigan and over the northern half of New England, turning to rain
over southern New England and eastern New York state.
   Overnight snowfall in Vermont included 2 or 3 inches at Ludlow,
with 1 to 2 inches at Bellows Falls, Rockingham, Windsor and St.
Johnsbury.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended over south-central Texas
through the Texas Gulf Coast, southern Louisiana and southern
Mississippi into southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.
   During the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, Texas rainfall included
0.98 of an inch at College Station and 0.84 at Victory.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 6
degrees above zero at Gunnison, Colo., to 82 at Naples, Fla.
Thursday morning's low for the lower 48 states was 22 degrees below
zero at Gunnison.
   For Friday, snow was forecast for northern and central New
England, much of inland New York state, northern Ohio, northern
Indiana and Michigan, with rain across much of Pennsylvania and
northern Delaware. Rain and thundershowers were forecast from the
southeastern third of Texas across the lower Mississippi Valley,
southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Scattered rain was
forecast on the northern Pacific Coast.
   Highs in the single digits were predicted across northeastern
Minnesota; in the teens and 20s from the remainder of the upper
Mississippi Valley across Wisconsin, through much of Michigan and
over northern Maine; in the 30s and 40s over the remainder of New
England through New Jersey, across the northern half of the
Appalachians, the rest of the Great Lakes, the lower Ohio Valley,
the Tennessee Valley, much of Illinois, from the western third of
Iowa acoss northern Arkansas, the northern half of the Plains, the
upper Missouri Valley, and the Rockies into Utah; in the 70s to near
80 over the Florida Peninsula; in the 70s from southern California
across southern Arizona; and generally in the 50s and 60s for the
remainder of the nation.

   Government workers plan to celebrate
the end of the Reagan administration on Friday with parties, parades
and political meetings, the state radio Voice of Nicaragua said.
   ``The workers will show their ingenuity to mock imperialism and
the reactionaries in this country,'' the radio said Thursday
   It said a parade will be held from the northeastern, industrial
part of the capital to the Plaza of the Revolution, in what was
downtown Managua before it was destroyed an earthquake 16 years ago.
   A public party will follow, the broadcast said.
   The newspaper Barricada of the governing Sandinista National
Liberation Front began publishing articles by American writers this
week on ``Eight Years of Yankee Failure in Nicaragua.''
   The leftist government says it hopes normal relations with the
United States can be restored after President-elect George Bush
takes office.
   The Reagan administration financed Contra rebels who have fought
to overthrow the Sandinistas since 1981. It also has maintained
economic sanctions on Nicaragua.

   The sign on the street stand read ``Sweatshirts
$11,'' but the Bush inaugural sweatshirts were going for $18 with
the vendor's apologies Thursday.
   ``They cost me almost double,'' explained Said Mahfus, 47, as he
tended his stand on the corner of 17th Street and Pennsylvania
Avenue, a block from the White House.
   ``I pay $80 a dozen for these,'' he said, pointing to his
customary stock of ``Welcome to Washington'' and ``Georgetown
Hoyas'' sweatshits, ``and $148 for these,'' patting the shelf full
of ``George to George'' sweatshirts with pictures of both Washington
and Bush.
   Even at $18, he had sold about three dozen from this prime
location, and his stock of buttons was disappearing fast.
   ``This `George to George' is very hot,'' said Mahfus, an Afghan
refugee who has sold souvenirs on the same corner for nearly three
years.
   Mahfus hopes to return to his homeland one day. ``I was not
working on the street in my country. I had my own business,'' he
said. ``But I have to feed my family.''
   And the new president?
   ``It's great for us, especially for Afghanistan's problems. Bush
and Reagan were the best,'' he said.

   Gordon Littig, a retired military man, had a
plan: take the subway downtown Thursday, check out the reviewing
stands outside the White House, then watch the festivities Friday
from the comfort of his living room.
   Littig, 69, and his wife, Betty, were strolling in the
unseasonably warm sunshine when they heard that Bush might be
driving out of the White House soon.
   A full hour later, the Alexandria, Va., couple was front and
center in the crowd that stood in the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue
and cheered as the vice president's limousine pulled out the
driveway and Bush, his nose practically pressed against the glass,
gave a big wave.
   ``We just stumbled onto this,'' said Littig. ``We thought it
would be nice to see it here today and watch it on TV tomorrow.''
   The Littigs have been particularly pleased with the post-election
Bush.
   ``I'm more impressed now after the election at some of his
speeches than I was before. It seems like he's sort of a
practical-type person that will give us the leadership,'' he said.
   ``He's a good Republican. That's a big plus in the first place,''
said Mrs. Littig. ``He just impresses me. We thought Reagan was
wonderful and I thought he'd be a hard man to follow _ and he is
going to be a hard man to follow. But I think Bush is going to be
equally as good.''
   And as for those living rooms plans Friday?
   ``That's what he thinks,'' Mrs. Littig said firmly. ``I'm going
to try to drag him back down here to watch the parade.''

   Inside St. John's Church, facing the White
House from across Lafayette Square, organist Samuel Carabetta
practiced ``Amazing Grace.''
   The organ music filled the empty pews of the small, pillared
church that on Friday morning will be occupied by President-elect
Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle and their wives in a
private service a few hours before the swearing-in.
   Their presence will help the 172-year-old Episcopal church uphold
the title that appears on its bulletin boards: ``The Church of the
Presidents.''
   ``Every president of the United States since James Madison has
attended services here,'' the signs read.
   The Bushes and Quayles will be facing an altar draped in green
with fresh flowers arrayed beneath a cross. Above the altar, a
stained-glass window made at Chartres Cathedral in France depicts
the Last Supper.
   The parish bulletin for Sunday starts with a note from the
pastor, the Rev. John C. Harper: ``We have prayed for our leaders
this past week, and we will do so again.
   ``Our prayer is for wise actions in order that the land we love
will provide room for individuals and that truly great men and women
will love the truth so much that they will be thus enabled to
accomplish great things,'' said Harper, who will preside at the
service.

   A $25 million, four-day party celebrating
George Bush's inauguration is neither excessive nor inappropriate,
Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson said Thursday.
   ``We've passed Andy Jackson's time, when the president of the
United States could say, `Y'all come on over,' and just throw open
the doors of the White House,'' the governor said at an
inaugural-week breakfast.
   ``We're a different nation now,'' Thompson told his Illinois
audience. ``And I don't think the nation minds if George Bush begins
his inaugural with a flyby over the Lincoln Memorial and fireworks.''
   Thompson branded as ``sour grapes'' a complaint by former Sen.
William Proxmire, D-Wis., that private donors should have used the
$1,500 they spent on the inaugural dinner to feed the poor instead.
   ``The price for the dinner was not to buy $1,500 worth of food,
obviously,'' he said. ``It goes to pay the expenses of the
inaugural, which includes many events which are free and open to the
public _ whether you're a Republican or a Democrat.

   Marylanders created a giant cowboy boot and
10-gallon hat for a float, cooked thousands of meals and groomed
tiny horses in preparation for Friday's inauguration.
   ``It's been a heckuva week,'' said Jim Caulfield, president of
Ridgewell's Caterers, a Bethesda-based company that was among the
five caterers serving five $1,500-a-plate inaugural dinners
Wednesday night.
   ``We'll serve 25,000 people at 70 different locations this
week,'' Caulfield added. ``This is a logistical nightmare.''
   Six horses owned by Fernando Ruiz, 42, of Clarksburg, Md., will
march in the inaugural parade, as will 15 carefully clipped
miniature horses from Denton.
   Float makers are busy too. Earl C. Hargrove's company, which is
working on its 10th inauguration, has 66 floats on its agenda this
year. One float features a pair of maroon, gold glitter-studded
cowboy boots. One boot, probably dozens of sizes too big for even
Paul Bunyan, anchors each end of the float, a tribute to Texas,
President-elect Bush's adopted state.
   A 10-gallon plastic foam hat that stands more than 10 feet tall
will pull the entire contraption.

   George Bush, on the eve of his swearing-in as
president, said Thursday he plans no instant domestic initiatives _
no ``first 100 days'' _ and isn't ready to entertain a new East-West
summit or arms talks pending a reassessment of superpower relations.
   Bush said his inaugural address, after taking the presidential
oath at noon Friday, would be ``a broad appeal to the American
people to pitch in and help,'' but without many specific calls to
action.
   Bush met with news agency journalists at the White House prior to
reporting to the Oval Office for his last meeting with President
Reagan as his subordinate. After talking privately _ a weekly habit
on Thursdays for eight years _ the pair went to the Roosevelt Room
to share their sentiments with senior White House aides.
   According to spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, Bush said ``I wouldn't
be the president if not for my teacher here, and my friend.''
Reagan, the spokesman said, expressed equal warmth for his
successor, and quipped: ``George never took my pulse once.''
   Bush's upbeat mood was matched by Washington's glorious weather.
Inaugural celebrants strolled to and fro without topcoats in the
balmy-for-January sunshine. A mixture of sunshine and clouds, with
an afternoon chill, was predicted for Friday, when Bush takes the
oath and more than 10,000 performers join his parade to the White
House.
   Four years ago, the weather was so harsh that Reagan had to be
sworn in indoors and his inauguration parade was cancelled.
   Bush said his inaugural address ``will be an expression of
satisfaction about how far we've come as a nation, and a recognition
that we've got a long way to go,'' the president-elect said in an
interview. At the same time, he called the concept of a busy ``first
100 days'' with Congress one ``that doesn't really apply'' to a
sitting vice president elected to the presidency.
   He said, too, he is not ready to entertain the idea of meeting
this year with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, and ``I don't think
we know yet'' when U.S. negotiators will be prepared to resume
strategic arms reduction talks, once set for Feb. 15.
   ``I think the Soviets understand that my intention is not to drag
my feet, but to simply do a prudent reassessment,'' Bush said. ``I
don't think progress should be measured solely on whether there's a
summit meeting.''
   Bush spent much of the day out of the public eye after a morning
speech to high school students. He promised he will do ``all in my
power'' to help young people flourish, saying America's ``best days
are yet to come.''
   Barbara Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, meanwhile, took
their special turns in the inaugural spotlight before joining their
spouses and 12,000 other black-tie revelers for a $9 million
entertainment gala, televised live to the nation by CBS.
   The outgoing chief executive spent his last full day in office
saying goodbyes. Meeting reporters, he discussed a somber aspect of
his presidency _ his failure to win the release of nine Americans
held hostage in Lebanon, some for nearly four years.
   ``We don't know where they are,'' Reagan admitted, saying any
rescue attempt would have been foolhardy.
   ``There hasn't been a moment that this hasn't been on my mind,''
he told news service reporters.
   Bush, appearing before the audience of top high school students
from around the country, borrowed a line from Franklin Delano
Roosevelt: ``We can't always build a future for our youth, but we
can build our youth for the future.''
   He also talked about Americans' characteristic optimism, and said
``No one better personifies that than a president named Ronald
Reagan, whose shoes are going to be pretty darn hard to fill.''
   Quayle, appearing separately before the same students, made a
confession: ``As one looks back at life, I'll be the first to admit
I wish I had taken education more seriously.''
   In the Capitol, where workers buffed the heavy mahogany doors
through which Reagan will usher his successor, the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee unanimously approved Bush's senior cabinet
appointee, Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III, who had
appealed during confirmation hearings this week for a restoration of
bipartisanship in foreign policy.
   Mrs. Bush, 63, an ample, white-haired, grandmother whose
trademark is a three-strand chocker of artificial pearls, wowed
12,000 guests who spilled into the three main halls of the John F.
Kennedy Center for a $50-a-person ``Salute to the First Lady.''
   She took note of the elegant surroundings, then said: ``Speaking
of glamor, I want you all to look at me very carefully.'' Striking
coquettish expression, she continued: ``Please notice the hair, the
makeup, the designer clothes.'' With that, she whipped open the coat
of her blue suit, revealing a patterned lining to match her scarf.
   The audience roared, then burst into ovation when she added:
``Look at me and remember. You may never see it again.''
   She also exacted no small revenge for the playful chiding she
took from her husband on Wednesday, when Bush repeatedly told
audiences she was getting ``mean and tough and ugly'' about making
him do household chores _ especially packing for the move.
   ``This is a good day for me to set something straight,'' Mrs.
Bush said. ``George went around town all day yesterday, telling that
story about the rigors of packing ...
   ``Who remembers where George Bush was last weekend? Fishing. So
much for the packing story. He won't dare tell that story again.''
   The black-tie, invitation-only gala at the Washington Convention
Center was expected to draw a television audience of 40 million
people. Headliners for the prime-time extravaganza included Frank
Sinatra, ballet star Mikhail Baryshnikov, the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir and two Bush favorites _ country singers Loretta Lynn and the
Oak Ridge Boys.
   Comedian Bob Hope, the grand marshal for Friday's inaugural
parade down Pennsylvania Avenue, was summoned for a ``surprise''
appearance at the gala, expected to gross $9 million in ticket sales
and revenues from TV commercials. That will help defray the
estimated $25 million in total costs for the inaugural festivities.
   Guests at the gala were paying as much as $250 per seat,
depending on location, and $25,000 for an eight-seat ``box'' close
to the stage crowned by a canopy emblazoned with gold stars.
   Bush laughed at himself in his talk to the high school students.
   ``I certainly learned the importance of education during the
campaign,'' he said. ``I learned how vital it is to memorize dates _
Pearl Harbor day, for example.'' Bush got that one woefully wrong
during the campaign.
   But if Bush has straightened out his dates, he still needs help
on names. He told the youngsters he hopes to do better in his
inaugural address than ``Benjamin Harrison did. He spoke for an hour
and a half and then got pneumonia and died a few weeks later.''
Actually, that was William Henry Harrison, Benjamin's grandfather.

   People with few assets but extensive holdings
in U.S. savings bonds can improperly establish Medicaid eligibility
and receive benefits under the federal insurance program for the
poor, according to a report Thursday.
   The General Accounting Office, a congressional watchdog agency,
recommended the government expand a verification system that
compares income declared by public assistance program applicants and
beneficiaries with information from certain federal agencies.
   Though applicants are required to report savings bond holdings,
those who don't escape the verification system because it doesn't
include U.S. Treasury data on bond holdings and that data currently
is not available to the states, the GAO said.
   The report did not estimate the number of Medicaid recipients
nationwide who have savings bond holdings over the amount allowed
for eligibility.
   The agency matched the records of 29,213 Medicaid nursing home
residents in Massachusetts as of Dec. 31, 1984 with U.S. Treasury
records and found 143 had unreported savings bond holdings exceeding
the $2,000 limit as of April 1986.
   The outstanding bonds were worth a total of about $1.5 million,
with individual holdings ranging from $2,000 to $60,000, the GAO
report said.
   Also, 262 of the Medicaid recipients had redeemed $2,000 or more
in bonds or had a combination or outstanding and redeemed bonds
worth $2,000 or more with outstanding bonds of less than $2,000, the
report said. However, the GAO could not determine when the cash from
the redeemed bonds was disposed of.
   Applicants for Medicaid are required to disclose on their initial
application all income and assets _ including assets disposed of
during the previous two years. Medicaid agencies also conduct annual
reviews to verify continued eligibility of recipients.
   ``Our work in Massachusetts showed that the potential exists for
individuals with extensive bond holdings to improperly establish
Medicaid eligibility,'' the GAO said.
   The problem, the GAO said, is with the Income and Eligibility
Verification System. Each state is required to have such a system to
compare the income declared by program applicants with information
from the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security
Administration.
   The shared information includes interest earned on redeemed
savings bonds and on bonds paying periodic interest, but it does not
include the value of U.S. savings bond holdings.

<UNK>Researchers Seek Cause of Tumors Affecting Endangered Sea Turtles</UNK>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Research veterinarians are trying to pin
down the cause of mysterious tumors threatening the survival of
endangered green sea turtles off Florida and around the Hawaiian
islands.
   ``The incidence of the tumors has greatly increased during the
past seven years,'' said Dr. Elliott Jacobson, wildlife specialist
at the University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine, in a
statement Thursday.
   ``The best information we have so far suggests they're caused by
a virus, and at the moment, we're seeking to isolate a virus from
the tissues of affected turtles,'' he said.
   The efforts of Jacobson and co-investigator Dr. Jack Gaskin, are
supported by grants from the private ``Save a Turtle'' group in the
Florida Keys and ``Save the Turtle'' of Chicago.
   Jacobson said the tumor epidemic is a particular threat to the
already endangered green sea turtle.
   ``The tumors have been spotted on about half the green sea
turtles found along the Indian River lagoon system,'' said Jacobson,
referring to the 100-mile-long stretch of waterways protected by
barrier islands along Florida's Central Atlantic Coast.
   He said the same percentage of affected sea turtles has been
reported in Hawaii by biologist George Balazs of the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
   The tumors develop over both the soft body tissue and shell of
the turtle, often appearing on and around their eyes.
   Dr. Peter Pritchard, vice president of the Florida Audubon
Society and an expert on green sea turtles, said the disease now
threatens only certain sea turtle populations, but others are not
immune.
   ``The potential for the disease to spread through migration is
definitely there,'' he said.

<HEAD>Chopsticks Plant Closed For Repairs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HIBBING, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chopsticks plant that was hailed at its
1986 opening for boldness in taking on the Japanese in the foreign
trade war is $7 million in debt and closed for repairs after losing
$3.5 million in 1988.
   The heavily subsidized plant in this mining town in severe
decline was shut down Dec. 15 and its 65 employees were laid off
because of faulty equipment, said Ian Ward, the company president.
   Machinery intended to speed production was vibrating and spoiling
the chopsticks' veneer, said Ward, president of Lakewood Forest
Products, the Vancouver, British Columbia, owner of the plant.
   Ward said a new machine is being built and is expected to be
installed by the end of January. Production will resume in early
February, he said.
   Japanese buyers of the chopsticks haven't gotten discouraged and
will buy as many sets as the plant can produce, said Don Myers, a
Lakewood spokesman in Canada.
   Lakewood originally said it would employ up to 120 workers and
produce up to 7 million pairs of disposable chopsticks a day, but it
was making about 700,000 pairs a day when it closed, Myers said.
   The Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board loaned $3.4
million to the company in December 1985 to help get the plant
started. The company also got about $1 million in loans, grants and
free land from the city and state.
   Jim Benson, a planner with the IRRRB development agency which
issued industrial revenue bonds to make the loan, said he will visit
the plant Friday. ``It's been a concern. That's why we make site
visits,'' Benson said Thursday. ``We've been over there monthly for
the past six months.''
   The chopsticks plant, which has a contract to supply a consortium
of Japanese buyers, lost $3.5 million in 1988 on sales of $420,000,
said Myers. The plant is worth about $13 million, he said. The
company is a total of $7 million in debt, Ward said.
   Production problems have plagued the operation since its June
1986 opening.
   New problems surfaced in July 1988 when the plant installed a new
lathe, Ward said in a telephone interview from Vancouver. An
adjoining machine, called a reeler, made vibrations that disturbed
the lathe's finishing work, he said.
   The manufacturer of the reeler, which was supposed to be an
improvement over the plant's original model, is buiding a new one at
no cost to Lakewood, Ward said.
   The city, faced with a severe decline in the mining of iron ore,
gave Lakewood a $225,000 grant, 10 free acres of land, a $250,000
loan and $275,000 in tax-increment financing to get it started,
Hibbing City Administrator Harry Gherarei said. The state loaned the
company an additional $250,000, he said.
   Lakewood recently raised about $603,000 in stock offerings to be
used to restart production, Myers said.
   ``Once this one is up and running we may build a second or third
plant,'' Myers said.

<HEAD>Movie Protagonist Waits In `Toughest Prison' For Court Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Even after a judge ruled in his favor last
month and the movie ``The Thin Blue Line'' questioned his guilt,
convicted police killer Randall Dale Adams doesn't expect his
imprisonment to end soon.
   Adams has spent more than 12 years in state prison, mostly at the
Eastham Unit, a vast prison farm in East Texas sometimes called
America's toughest, for the 1976 killing of Dallas officer Robert
Wood.
   ``Don't think 13 years is the ending to it, because it's not,''
said Adams, 40, who has been serving a life sentence since his death
sentence was commuted in 1980. ``This is the beginning of the end,
but it's taken 13 years to get back to square one.''
   After a Dallas hearing in which the key witness changed his
testimony, saying Adams wasn't even in the car Wood stopped just
before he was gunned down, state District Judge Larry Baraka ruled
in December that Adams did not receive a fair trial. The judge
recommended he be granted a new one or set free.
   ``Listening to the evidence, there's reasonable evidence to
believe the man's not guilty or didn't get a fair trial,'' the judge
said. ``As far as I'm concerned, it's all done _ over.''
   But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals could take as long as two
years to act upon Baraka's recommendation, attorneys say.
   If Adams is granted a new trial, Baraka said he doubts the state
would pursue the case because so many witnesses have changed their
stories.
   Adams and his Houston attorney, Randy Schaffer, also are trying
to enlist officials to ask the state Board of Pardons and Paroles
for a pardon recommendation.
   Then there is parole, which has been denied eight times, most
recently on Jan. 10, according to state records.
   Parole board spokeswoman Karin Armstrong said Adams' case would
next be up for official review in December. But, she said, as early
as March his case could get special reviews, which the board is
conducting because of prison crowding.
   Adams says he tries to draw a line between his private life and
the publicity from ``Thin Blue Line,'' which brought out new
evidence, by putting his court proceedings out of mind.
   ``I can't just sit at my house (cell) and think of this all day
long,'' he said.
   For the time being, Adams says, he is glad to be where he is.
   ``It may be the toughest prison in America, according to
Newsweek. But I'm happy to walk the halls of Eastham,'' he said.
``You know, Texas wanted to execute me in '79. So each day past that
is a day that I'm alive.''

<HEAD>New Report Details Site-By-Site Cleanup Needs At Government Plants</HEAD>

   It will cost more to clean up the Hanford
nuclear reservation in the state of Washington than any other
government-owned plant, the Energy Department said Thursday.
   Cleaning up Hanford's radioactive and toxic wastes could cost
between $37 billion and $57 billion over the next 50 years and even
then the site wouldn't be returned to a pristine condition, the
department said in a report prepared at the request of Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio.
   The new report provided site-by-site estimates for improving
safety, health and environmental conditions at Energy Department
facilities.
   Earlier this month the department said the cost for all the
plants in the country could be $91 billion to $200 billion.
   For some plants, the new report provided higher cleanup estimates
for known problem areas. For Hanford, the report boosted the
official inventory of cleanup problems.
   The report said about 440,000 cubic yards of high-level
radioactive waste is stored at Hanford. It also said about 1,500
inactive hazardous waste sites, including nine old reactors and
processing facilities, have been found on the reservation where raw
materials for nuclear weapons have been produced since the days of
the Manhattan Project.
   ``They (DOE) keep changing the math,'' complained Rep. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore. ``Two years ago they said there were 1,000 hazardous waste
sites, now they are saying 1,500.''
   ``We hope this report will provide substantial impetus for
Congress to provide the funding,'' said Chris Sankey, a department
spokeswoman.
   Glenn pressed Budget Director-designate Richard Darman to make
the same commitment.
   ``We can't put it off,'' Glenn told Darman during a confirmation
hearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which
Glenn chairs. ``This is really a tragic situation.
   ``We have several hundred thousand people around these plants,
and workers at these sites, that are truly at risk and I don't think
we have the option, just morally as a nation, to ignore that and put
it off over a 35- or a 40-year period.''
   Darman said President-elect Bush had asked him to meet with
Energy Department officials and begin working on the issue.
   Glenn called the problems at the government's network of nuclear
bomb factories ``nothing less than an environmental time bomb.''
   Following are the Energy Department's site-by-site estimates for
the cost of improving conditions at the various facilities.
   For each site, the list provides the maximum length of time;
expected cost; and the agency's highest projected cost, depending on
the interpretation of what is required.

<HEAD>Excerpts from Bush Interview</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from President-elect Bush's
interview Thursday with a group of news organizations.
   Q. How long are you going to let the (START) talks hang and do
you think you risk losing the momentum that President Reagan
achieved?
   A. I don't think we risk losing momentum that President Reagan
achieved because I think the Soviets understand that my intention is
not to drag my feet but to simply do a prudent reassessment. And in
terms of how long _ I don't think we know yet.
   I don't feel inclined to adopt a timetable at this point. We may
be able to do that in a week or two, just have a better feel for
when these things will be finished.
   But you've got to realize we don't have a lot of the people in
place whose views will be required on a reassessment. So we'll go
forward with whatever the assets are in defense and in state and in
the NSC but all of these bureaucracies are in a state of change.
   So my main point is: I think the Soviets understand this. I made
it very clear to General Secretary Gorbachev that there was _ that
this reassessment in no way was a footdragging operation exercise.
   Q. Does that mean that the talks themselves cannot be resumed
until that review is completed?
   A. There may be things that could be accomplished. To really move
forward on talks that have already made progress, we have to finish
our review.
   Q. Do you think it's going to be six months, a year?
   A. Have no way, can't help you, don't know. ... One of the first
things I'll do as president is order this review.
   Q. What are odds of talks with Mr. Gorbachev this year?
   A. I don't think we can make the odds. And more important than
that, that we have good sound positions that we will be advocating.
And whether that results in a summit or not, I think, is less
important than the fact that the process will go forward. ... I
don't think that progress should be measured solely on whether
there's a summit meeting.
   Q. President Reagan said yesterday that we should consider
renegotiating the Panama Canal treaties if Noriega remains in power.
How do you feel about that?
   A. I think we need to go slow on all that. The treaty has certain
obligations that ought to be met. I'm a great believer that once a
treaty is entered into and ratified, it ought to be kept.
   But I'd have to look at the treaty before I have any commment on
something like that.
   Q. Did you think process (of filling senior jobs) might be more
complete by now?
   A. In terms of undersecretaries and department heads? I know
we're about where we thought we'd be on the Cabinet. On the rest of
it, I don't know what a historical precedent was. I'd like to be
further ahead, put it that way. But I think we're doing all right on
it.
   Q. What would you like to accomplish in the first 100 days?
   A. ... I keep saying ours is different. Only Martin Van Buren and
I really know how different it is. And he ain't talking. ... I'm not
shooting for any 100 days. And I think it's kind of a concept that
doesn't really apply. Some may want it to apply.
   Q. What do hope to accomplish then as you first take control?
   A. I hope to see progress made on the budget. This is the No. 1
domestic economic problem facing the country. So we're going to have
to move forward on that, in terms of negotiations with the Congress.
I'm not quite naive enough to believe they'll accept everything I'll
propose in February.
   ... And then we'll have some things we will accomplish in the
first few months. Ethics legislation will be part of it. I'd like to
see some action on not only formulating the policy, but taking
certain steps toward more accomplishment and understanding in the
environmental field.
   We'll see the drug, anti-narcotics operation get geared up in
that first few months there. And I think we've got to have a good
plan there that shows a seriousness that surely I feel. ...
   Educational initiatives are important, but they won't be simply
adding to the federal spending account.
   Monies are not going to be there to do all the things I want to
do, and that I feel are priority. So we'll have to sort through and
set priorities. Some of what I want to do will have to wait on a
solution to the budget question.
   Q. How do you see that being solved?
   A. I see it being solved through negotiation. I think you're
going to have serious negotiation. And even then, you're not going
to do this in a year obviously.
   If we can get a good agreement on the budget, I think the
psychology of that will have an ameliorating effect on these
interest rates.
   And I think the problem will be easier once world markets see
agreement has been reached and it is clear the U.S. government is
determined to get the deficit down. ...
   Q. Will your campaign proposal to reduce the capital gains tax be
in your budget plan?
   A. Yes. There are some technical things that have to be done, but
yes it will have to be there.
   Q. The State Department tape of Arafat threatening people with
``ten bullets'' _ what's your reaction?
   A. I'd like to see the context of the tape before commenting, but
clearly that does not facilitate improving relations with Arafat. So
I want to see it. I don't know what the context of that. But just
from what I've read, I'd say it's a setback to peace rather than an
enhancement of peace.
   Q. Will you authorize resumption of U.S.-PLO contacts?
   A. I'm not going to change the policy. I supported the policy. It
was part of what I wanted ... that policy will not change. In terms
of when you need more talks, I think each talk should be on a
case-by-case basis. And we'll just see what will facilitate the
peace dialogue.
   ... I can't tell you about the tape because I haven't read it or
listened to it or know what the context of it is. But if it's a
reversion to supporting international terror, that could foul up the
dialogue.
   Q. Will you maintain the present policy of benign neglect toward
hostages?
   A. I will maintain the policy of leaving no stone unturned for
the release of the hostages. But that policy has another side of it,
and that is we will not buckle under to the demands that are being
thrown out there by those that are holding the hostages. ...
   Q. Can you give us some idea of the message, the tone, you will
strike tomorrow?
   A. I've got it pretty well in my mind now. The text is locked in,
all but locked in.
   It will be just a broad appeal to the American people to pitch in
and help. It'll be an expression of satisfaction about how far we've
come as a nation, and a recognition that we've got a long way to go.
   It will be a re-emphasis of my conviction that many of these
problems that remain unsolved can best be solved by engagement of
the private thousand points of light concept. The private entities
that do things so much better than government, and that have done so
much to solve pressing problems. ...
   It will be along those thematic lines. ... I'm now an expert on
inaugural addresses in terms of numbers of words as well as themes.
Most of them, at least the modern ones, are pretty much the same in
that context: broad and thematic as opposed to point specific.
   Q. Are there any concrete actions you will take tomorrow
afternoon?
   A. There may be, but they won't be of major import. I'll go to
work, though, just as I always have.
   Q. Will you continue the Saturday radio addresses?
   A. I think we're not going to do those. We may later on.
   Q. Will you be wandering out (of the White House for
spur-of-the-moment trips in the evening and weekends)?
   A. I can't pledge to be anchored down. But I'd like to work out
some understanding that the world's not going to come to a
screeching halt if you don't know that I'm eating Peking duck over
in Virginia some place.
   And you may not agree with that, but I think it's silly to have
to feel that when the president goes out of that thing for a private
supper, or to eat in a restaurant, that serious journalists, or
their editors, feel that the nation's business will come to a halt
if that is not reported.
   I'm not going to give up my ability to make up a decision in a
hurry. ...
   What's being protected? You mean, if I fall over and choke in the
restaurant? Suppose I fall over and choke in the White House _
you're not there.

<HEAD>Michael Dukakis, Other Dignitaries Attend Funeral Of Lloyd Bentsen
Sr.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lloyd M. Bentsen Sr. was eulogized Thursday
for a ``life he invested in other people'' in a funeral attended by
more than 1,000 people, including his U.S. senator son and Michael
Dukakis.
   Bentsen, 95, died at the wheel of his automobile Tuesday morning
in a two-car crash at a rural intersection in Hidalgo County, in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley.
   The Texas House passed a resolution Thursday that honored
Bentsen, an early developer of the state's southern tip along the
Mexican border, saying ``Texas lost one of its most esteemed
citizens.''
   Dr. James Eaves, delivering the sermon at First Baptist Church,
hailed the ``complete life'' of Bentsen, who rose early each day and
remained active in his agricultural and real estate businesses until
his death.
   Bentsen would be remembered for his hard work, devotion to his
family, and his ``life he invested in other people,'' said Eaves,
the former interim pastor of Bentsen's church, and a professor at
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth.
   ``I remember about the time I asked Senator (Lloyd) Bentsen (Jr.)
to run with me, his dad had just done a round trip to San Antonio to
negotiate a land deal and had driven himself up and driven himself
back all in one day, and this man was 95 years of age,'' said
Dukakis, Massachusett's governor and the 1988 Democratic Party
presidential candidate, after the funeral.
   ``I remember the last rally we had here in McAllen, and he was up
on that platform very proud of his son, very proud of the campaign
and just a very strong, very good person,'' Dukakis said of the
elder Bentsen, who also played a prominent role in the Democratic
National Convention last summer.
   Bentsen grew up one of six children of Danish immigrant parents,
thrashing wheat and busting wild horses in South Dakota. He came to
Texas in 1917, met his wife, Dolly, and started building his south
Texas empire, which included farming, ranching, agricultural,
banking, oil and real estate.
   He eventually held nearly 50,000 acres of farms and ranches and
played a major role in the development of Texas' citrus industry.
But later he also recognized the need to preserve the border area's
vanishing wildlife habitat, and donated land that became the
587-acre Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park.
   He and Dolly, who died in 1977, had four children: Lloyd M.
Bentsen Jr.; Kenneth, a Houston architect; Don, a McAllen
businessman; and Betty, wife of a wer Rio Grande Valley businessman.

   Shining Path guerrillas tried to black out the
capital, and police killed two rebels who attacked a patrol car
Thursday, officials said.
   The violence came during an industrial ``armed strike'' called by
the Maoist rebels but ignored by workers, officials reported.
   Members of the guerrilla group blew down three power pylons on
Lima's outskirts late Wednesday night, causing a momentary flicker
of lights in some districts of the capital, police said.
   They said the sabotage was in support of the ``armed strike,'' a
term used by the Shining Path to imply violence against anyone
refusing to take part.
   At about dawn Thursday, guerrillas attacked a patrol car in an
industrial sector, wounding a policeman. The officer's companions
returned fire, killing two of the attackers, and police
reinforcements arrested 15 suspects, authorities reported.
   Soldiers patrolled in armored vehicles and manned street-corner
sentry posts in the city's two most important industrial zones.
Reporters on the scene said labor activity appeared normal.
   Police said advertisements for the strike were painted on walls
in neighborhoods around factories.
   Dozens of strikes, some crippling, have been staged during the
past year because of severe economic problems led by a record
inflation rate of 1,722 percent for 1988.
   Thursday's strike call was the first for Lima issued by the
rebels, but Shinging Path ``armed strikes'' paralyzed Ayacucho, 225
miles southeast of Lima, for a week in October and Huancayo, 130
miles east of the capital, for one day in November.
   Both cities are in the Andes region, where the Shining Path
movement began in 1980 and is greatly feared.
   More than 12,000 people have been killed since the insurgency
began. The Shining Path recently began infiltrating labor unions and
carrying out attacks during strikes.

   The homeless lined up for a soup-kitchen meal
Wednesday outside Union Station, where wealthy Republicans gathered
for a $1,500-a-plate feast of Maryland crab and roast loin of pork
with George Bush and Dan Quayle.
   Three hours before the start of the candlelight inaugural dinner,
several hundred street people enjoyed a ``counter Inaugural
banquet'' of hot chili and rice, tortilla chips, salad and apple
cider on the plaza in front of Union Station.
   While they ate off of paper plates, the homeless listened to
guitar players and watched a pro-abortion street theater featuring a
man in tennis shoes wearing a Bush mask and a sign reading, ``I
oppose abortion'' hanging around his neck.
   Protesters organized by a group called, ``The Counter-Inaugural
Coalition for a Peoples' Agenda,'' carried placards reading, ``Food,
Not Bombs,'' ``George Knew'' and ``The Skies Are for Stars, Not
War.'' Another sign under a huge peace symbol read, ``Now Appearing
In a Four-Year Show, Son of Reaganstein, co-starring Big Bird.''
   U.S. Park Police said the demonstrators were being dispersed when
the inaugural dinner in the newly-refurbished station began in
mid-evening.
   The president-elect and his vice president, Quayle, were guests
of honor at the lavish dinner attended by more than 2,500 Republican
stalwarts and fat-cat contributors. The black-tie crowd was so large
the dinner was held at Union Station and the nearby Pension Building
and Corcoran Gallery of Art.
   For $1,500 ticket, each invited guest was to hear brief remarks
by Bush and Quayle at the dinner sites and feast on a four-course
dinner.
   Outside on the Plaza, Park Police Sgt. Robert Kass banished a
half dozen conservative Republican counter-demonstrators for lack of
a permit.
   The leader of the group, Eugene Delgaudio, 34, executive director
of the private, ultra-conservative activists group known as ``Public
Advocate,'' said he wanted to show ``there's a better way than
openly, political negativism.'' He said his demonstrators were to
welcome the black-tie dinner guests with American flags and signs
reading, ``Welcome Non-Liberals.''
   Several homeless people paused between spoonfuls of chili to say
that the $2.25 million in proceeds from the inaugural dinners should
be spent to provide food, additional shelters, job training and
subsidized public transportation for Washington's street people.
   Referring to the inaugural diners, Roosevelt Carrington, a
30-year-old homeless person, said, ``I think maybe they should eat
the same thing we're having so they'll know what it's like.''
   Said Ronnie Thompson, 38: ``They done robbed most of it from
us.'' He said the inaugural dinner proceeds should be used for the
homeless because ``a lot of them have given up.''
   More than 1,000 people were served at the counter-inaugural
dinner at Union Station.
   As guests began arriving shortly before 7 p.m., several hundred
of the people at the counter-inaugural banquet began shouting,
``What about the homeless'' and ``50,000 dead from AIDS. Where was
George?''
   Although the Park Police allowed the demonstration to spread
closer to the train depot than the demonstrators' permit allowed,
the protestors remained 100 yards from the entrance where the
invited guests were emerging from their cars and were barely audible
from that distance.
   At about 7:30 p.m., one half hour before the Union Station
banquet would get officially underway, the Park Police received
reinforcement and barricades which were set up in front of the
demonstrators.
   Park Police Sgt. G. F. Wallace, asked whether the barricades had
been planned in advance, said, ``I'm not in on these decisions, but
I imagine it was spontaneous because of the crowd's activity...we
can't have the police spread out or people can sneak through. We
should have had them up there before.''
   There was no indication that any of the invited guests to the
Union Station dinner were even aware of the demonstration. None of
them came over to see what is going on.
   At the majestic Corcoran Gallery of Art, dinner guests who also
paid $1,500 each were serenaded up a royal blue carpeted stairway by
violins playing, ``This Could Be The Start of Something Big.''
   Elegantly attired guests wandered through art displays ranging
from modern neon art to traditional American pieces. The gallery was
hung with blue bunting with white stars and large arrangements of
red roses decorated the corridors.
   Among the guests were Sen. John Warner, R-Va., and Bush's son,
Marvin, and his wife, Margaret. The younger Bush said he was having
fun, but mostly waiting for Friday's swearing in of his father.
   ``The rest will be fun,'' he said, adding, however, ``the one we
will all be looking forward to will be Friday - an incredibly proud
moment for all of us.''
   His wife, who wore a fitted, strapless black gown with a brocade
bodice, said she had never seen George and Barbara Bush so excited
as they have been with the inauguration approaching. ``They're like
two kids,'' she said.

<HEAD>Communist North Ready To Start Joint Ventures With South Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea says it stands
ready to start trade and joint venture projects with its capitalist
rival, South Korea, the Ministry of Trade and Industry announced
Thursday.
   It said the North made this known when one of its senior trade
officials met for business talks with a South Korean businessman in
Tokyo on Dec. 30.
   The announcement said that Lee Kang-sae, a vice president of
Sunkyong Ltd., a leading Seoul trading firm, had government approval
for the talks.
   Ministry officials refused to identify the North Korean official.
   The North Korean told Lee the Pyongyang government intends to
give ``active support'' for joint venture projects between business
companies of the two sides, the announcement said.
   ``The two sides discussed wide-ranging measures to promote trade,
especially in the areas of textiles and mining products, and the
North Korean side was ... enthusiastic about starting joint
projects,'' it said.
   South Korean business magnate Chung Ju-yung will leave for the
North on Monday for a 16-day visit to discuss investment and joint
venture projects. The government formally authorized the visit on
Thursday.
   Accompanying Chung, 74, honorary chairman of the giant Hyundai
group, will be two executives specializing in civil engineering and
plant construction.
   Chung is orginally from North Korea. He is the first leading
South Korean businessman to be invited by Pyongyang to visit the
North since the Korean peninsula was divided into communist North
and capitalist South in 1945, when Soviet and U.S. troops ended
Japan's colonial rule over Korea.
   Observers in Seoul believe the North is under pressure to revive
its sagging economy even with investment from South Korea. The North
reportedly owes about $5 billion to communist-bloc as well as
Western nations.
   North Korea adopted a joint venture law in 1984, but failed to
lure major foreign investment. Last year it created a new government
ministry to handle joint venture business with foreign concerns.
   Also Thursday, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that
South Korean radical students will be allowed to attend the World
Youth Festival in Pyongyang this year but will be warned to avoid
political discussion.
   Yonhap said the government will send members of the radical
National Council of Student Representatives as well as other
students.
   South Korean officials previously took the position that the
North's invitation was aimed at stirring up anti-U.S. and
anti-government activism.
   Yonhap, quoting an unidentified government source, said Seoul now
felt ``it is desirable to make full use of all opportunities . .. to
promote exchanges between South and North Korea.''
   The festival, held every four years, is a major political, arts
and sports event involving mostly communist and Third World nations.
   Yonghap also reported that Washington may consider closing the
U.S. cultural center in Kwangju, which has been attacked by radical
students seven times since last year.
   It quoted U.S. Charge d'Affaires Thomas S. Brooks as telling
Kwangju Mayor Choi In-ki on Thursday: ``After yesterday's attack on
the Kwangju cultural center, we think it may be time to reconsider
whether to keep it any longer.''
   The mayor disagreed, telling Brooks ``it is not proper to
consider the attack as the intention of the entire citizenry,''
Yonhap added.
   Kwangju, 180 miles southwest of Seoul, is the capital of South
Cholla province.
   About 50 students attacked the center with firebombs and rocks on
Wednesday. No one was hurt, but damage was done.
   The students accuse the United States of complicity in the harsh
military suppression of a bloody civil uprising in Kwangju in 1980.
America denies it.
   Also Thursday:
   _The government has decided to jam ``slanderous'' North Korean FM
radio broacasts aimed at young audiences in South Korea, officials
said.
   _Three shipyard workers took poison but survived during a violent
labor protest at Samsung Shipbuilding's head office in Seoul, police
said. The workers said they were protesting the company's alleged
suppression of the labor movement.

<HEAD>Trawler Flees Disputed Waters After Irate Islanders Threaten Violence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A French fishing
company ordered one of its ships to leave disputed waters off
Canada's Atlantic Coast on Thursday after citizens of this French
island territory threatened to ram it.
   Fernand Leborgne, president of the French fishing company
Comapeche, broke a five-day deadlock in the dispute by ordering the
factory ship Grande Hermine to go to a U.S. port.
   Comapeche officials in Paris said the decision was aimed at
ending the ``violent tension'' that developed this week when
islanders threatened to ram the trawler with a smaller boat if it
did not leave the area.
   ``It's a partial victory,'' said a weary Victor Reux, economic
adviser to St. Pierre and Miquelon, a group of eight French-owned
islands. ``For the time being we are happy, but nothing is over.''
   The 6,000 people living on the rocky archipelago 10 miles south
of Newfoundland rely almost entirely on fishing for their
livelihood. Last fall, a compromise in a long-running dispute
allowed one factory ship from France to fish in the zone.
   But the dispute flared again Sunday when the French government
allowed the Grande Hermine to fish in the zone. Another trawler, the
Victor Plevin, also owned by Comapeche, has been fishing in the area
since early January.
   The fishermen charge the factory ships take in too many fish and
don't provide any employment at the territory's fish processing
plants.
   The Grand Hermine will stay away from the area during a new round
of negotiations between the territory and Paris, Comapeche officials
said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thursday called
President Reagan a ``true and perfect gentleman'' in a letter of
thanks and farewell to one of her staunchest allies.
   The letter, made public by Mrs. Thatcher's 10 Downing St. office
the day before President-elect George Bush takes over from Reagan,
read: ``Dear Ron, As you leave office, I wanted simply to say thank
you.
   ``You have been a great president, one of the greatest, because
you stood for all that is best in America.
   ``Your beliefs, your convictions, your faith shone through
everything you did. And your unassuming courtesy was the hallmark of
the true and perfect gentleman. You have been an example and an
inspiration to us all.''
   Mrs. Thatcher also thanked Nancy Reagan ``for all the warmth and
support which she has given you, as well as for her own very special
contribution in the war against drugs.''
   The prime minister said she and her husband, Denis, ``wish you
both every happiness as you lay down your great burden.''
   Mrs. Thatcher added in her own handwriting: ``We shall miss you
both very much. Warm personal regards. Yours ever, Margaret.''
   The ``special relationship'' between Britain and the United
States was strengthened greatly during the long terms in office of
Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entire crews of airliners on long-haul flights have
been found to be asleep, the Civil Aviation Authority said Thursday
in announcing new controls to prevent overwork by pilots.
   It said a study found evidence that some pilots worked too many
hours and some crews had constant changes in their rosters.
   Dr. Geoffrey Bennett, the authority's chief medical officer,
said: ``I can remember seeing one or two reports when the whole crew
were asleep while a long-haul aircraft was cruising.
   ``If asked, any long-haul pilot of 20 years experience will say
that at some stage he will have woken up and found the whole crew
asleep. This is not to say there is any great deal of hazard in
this.''
   Many necessary flight functions are computerized in today's
airliners.
   Bennett said there was discussion of captains arranging
``organized naps'' for crew members during long flights.
   Civil Aviation Authority guidelines, to be introduced in April,
result from a study of 10 airline tour operators last summer that
showed existing rules were being exploited.
   While saying no rules were broken and safety was not at risk, the
authority made clear there were instances of duty periods for pilots
being extended, sometimes as a matter of course rather than to meet
exceptional circumstances.

   Crowds returned to the streets of Miami on Thursday
night _ not for civil disobedience, but rather for slam dunk and
Michael Jordan.
   People streamed in to the area surrounding Miami Arena for the
National Basketball Association game between the Miami Heat and the
Chicago Bulls.
   The game was a test of whether this city had calmed after three
nights of looting, burning and rock throwing that followed the
police shooting of a black motorcyclist just 12 blocks from the
arena.
   The sold-out game came two nights after officials canceled a Heat
contest with the Phoenix Suns.
   ``We had no concern about coming down here at all,'' said Glen
Haft, who brought his wife and son. ``We thought things had calmed
down. We were sure the police would make sure there were no
problems.''
   Haft's son, David, 11, had been looking forward to the game
featuring slam-dunk artist Michael Jordan's only Miami appearance
this year, but confessed he feared he might miss the game.
   ``I was afraid I was going to get bottles and rocks and sticks
thrown at us but it hasn't happened so far,'' David said.
   There was no indication of trouble in the area surrounding the
new, pastel pink stadium. About 100 police officers _ 60 more than
usual _ maintained a highly visible presence, and there were no
incidents.
   The $52 million, 15,000-seat stadium opened last summer and it
and its NBA tenant were an instant success.
   Fifteen of the Heat's 18 games home games have been sell-outs. A
19th game was canceled because of the riots Monday. Thursday night's
game had sold out in October 18 minutes after tickets went on sale.
   But empty seats in the arena were still visible at halftime,
indicating some no-shows.
   The arena is an important part of plans to revitalize the
neighborhood and bring people back to the city's downtown.
Construction has already begun on an apartment building complex for
people who work in the city; the arena is designed as the anchor of
that project.
   But not all the fans thought the location of the arena on the
edge of Overtown was that wise.
   ``It's a good place, I just think they should have put it some
place else,'' said Dwayne Burgard. ``They should have known
something like this would happen.''
   City boosters were anxious for the night to go smoothly.
   ``It's absolutely critical that the game takes place tonight,''
said Bill Collom, president of the Greater Miami Chamber of
Commerce. ``It's just got to take place.''
   The street vendors and ticket scalpers had similar sentiments.
One T-shirt seller said he lost hundreds of dollars when Tuesday
night's game was canceled.
   Raymond Scales, a city school counselor, had a good night by
selling out of T-shirts that read, ``I survived the Miami riot.''
   ``I don't think people had much to worry about here tonight,''
said Scales. ``I think it's good they put the arena here. This area
needs to be revitalized.''

<HEAD>Crime Rate Up 17 Percent In Gorbachev's Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms
contributed to a 17 percent increase in the Soviet crime rate last
year, the interior minister was quoted Thursday as saying.
   ``Robberies, assaults and theft of personal property increased in
frequency by more than a third,'' Interior Minister Vadium Bakatin
said in an interview in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda.
   Attacks on police increased and street crime rose by more than 40
percent, said Bakatin, who supervises the Soviet Union's uniformed
police.
   In his first major interview since taking over in October, he
said police themselves were often corrupt and ill-prepared to fight
crime.
   Under Gorbachev, officials and the state media have been more
open about reporting drug abuse, prostitution and other crimes,
including details of criminal investigations.
   But Bakatin's half-page interview in Pravda was an important
admission that reform has brought problems as well.
   He said the reforms have created ``complicated, at times painful
processes of self-cleansing, an increase in civil and ethnic
self-awareness.''
   Two republics where ethnic awareness is growing most rapidly,
Latvia and Estonia, headed the areas where Bakatin said crime is
growing most rapidly.
   He also cited several times the violence between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis, where Interior Ministry troops were called in to
restore order.
   Many criminals released from labor colonies under legal reforms
have been unable to find work because state industries are cutting
back their workforces to meet efficiency demands of Gorbachev's
economic reforms, he said. Some return to crime.
   Bakatin also said police are ill-prepared to cope with organized
crime seeping into the cooperative movement of private enterprise,
which Gorbachev has encouraged to provide goods and services not
available under the state economy.
   Bakatin gave no figures for the number of crimes committed, but
said, ``It can be stated boldly that the level of crime in the
country is significantly higher than statistics indicate today.''
   He also said the police system should be reformed.
   ``We have everything in the system of the Ministry of Internal
Affairs: bribery, treachery, bureaucratism, callousness, rudeness,
departmental separatism and illegality,'' he said.
   Some local police have tried to keep the number of crimes they
report as low as possible, fearing that reporting an increase will
damage their careers, he said.

   TABA, Israel-Egypt Border (AP) _ Negotiators reported progress on
the Taba border dispute after opening talks were delayed for 90
minutes Thursday by a squabble over whether Egyptian delegates would
arrive in a car with Israeli or Egyptian license plates.
   The Egyptians finally drove up in a U.N. bus, accompanied by
jeeps from both countries.
   The two sides finally sat down to discuss the border strip of
Taba, with its Israeli-built luxury hotel and holiday village, and
later reported progress on the issue of access by Israeli tourists
to the 250-acre resort strip.
   Abraham Sofaer, the U.S. mediator, said he expects a compromise
can be reached.
   The focus on access for Israelis suggested the strip could wind
up in Egypt's hands after straining Israeli-Egyptian relations for
six years.
   Reuven Merhav, the chief Israeli negotiator, reported ``progress
in the mutual issues we discussed, and arrangements regarding access
by Israelis.''
   He said the agreed points would be summarized in Friday's round
of negotiations as an ``initial agreement.''
   Nabil El Arabi, head of the Egyptian delegation, told reporters:
``I don't see any problem to finishing the negotiations in two
days.'' He said only ``very small items'' were left to discuss.
   ``We would like Israeli tourists to come here, not only by the
tens of thousands but by the tens and hundreds of thousands,'' said
Arabi.
   Taba came under Israeli rule when Israel captured the Sinai
Peninsula during the 1967 Middle East war. In 1982, Israel withdrew
from all of Sinai except Taba following the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian
peace treaty.
   The dispute was submitted to international arbitration. In
September, the arbitrators awarded Egypt key border points, but said
they were not authorized to determine a final marker that includes
the beach resort.
   The two countries are negotiating over where to place the last
marker.
   The talks are also supposed to develop a framework for Egyptian
purchase of the Sonesta Hotel, with the final deal to be worked out
by negotiations involving the hotel owners.
   As talks were going on, a group of Israeli yacht owners sailed
along the Taba coastline to demand free water access. An Israeli
gunboat chased them away.
   About 50 Israelis from nearby Elat symbolically marked the border
by stretching a rope that put Taba within Israel. One protester was
detained, Israel radio said.

   Fired National Security Council aide Oliver
North is challenging efforts by prosecutors in the Iran-Contra case
to subpoena the notebooks he compiled of his daily activities at the
NSC, the judge in the case disclosed Thursday.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell issued an order specifying
that North's filing outlining his opposition would be sealed to
protect references to a grand jury transcript. The filing was made
Wednesday, the judge's order said.
   Gesell had earlier scheduled a hearing for next Wednesday in the
event that North opposed the subpoena for the notebooks, which
detail his involvement in the Contra resupply operation as well as
the Reagan administration's arms sales to Iran.
   North used the spiral-bound stenographer's notebooks from Feb. 1,
1983 until the day he was fired, Nov. 25, 1986, when the
administration disclosed that a portion of the proceeds from the
Iran arms sales had been diverted to the Contras fighting the
leftist government in Nicaragua.
   Portions of the notebooks were turned over to the congressional
Iran-Contra investigating committees and disclosed during hearings.
   But North, through his attorney Brendan Sullivan, invoked his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination last year when a
Senate committee tried to get the notebooks.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan will get to look a gift horse in
the mouth after all.
   After professing ignorance of the impending gift most of the day,
the government finally confirmed Thursday evening that it plans to
send the outgoing president a horse from the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police.
   The first hint the gift was planned came Wednesday, when the
White House staff presented Reagan with new harnesses for the horses
at his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif.
   Reagan held aloft the leather gear and said: ``When I get home, I
understand the Canadian Mounted Police are delivering a horse. This
will take care of that horse.''
   But the Mounties, the prime minister's office and the Department
of External Affairs said all day Thursday they knew nothing of the
gift _ possibly because of a U.S. law preventing presidents from
accepting gifts while in office.
   After Friday's inauguration of President-elect George Bush, the
restrictions are gone.
   Late Thursday, a spokesman for Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
office said: ``I can now tell you that the president is getting a
horse, when he ceases to be president. That's all I can tell you.''

   Black-tie guests at Thursday night's gala in
honor of George Bush's inauguration sniffed that it wasn't
``appropriate'' as their festive evening got off to a dissonant
start with protesters screaming, ``Bush, Quayle, you can't hide; we
charge you with genocide.''
   Some three dozen demonstrators from gay and lesbian rights
groups, armed with a megaphone, taunted the fur-bedecked partygoers
as they waited in long lines to get through security screenings at
the Convention Center.
   ``Fifty thousand dead from AIDS; where was George?'' they
screamed, along with ``Money for AIDS, not for inaugurals,'' and
``Someone you love will die for AIDS; where will you be?''
   Police asked organizers to keep the circle moving, to clear an
area of sidewalk for passersby and to turn the megaphone down a bit.
They complied only with the first two requests, but police said
nothing further about the decibel level.
   ``The reason we're here is that $32 million is being spent on the
inauguration,'' said Robert Bray of Washington, a spokesman for the
demonstrators. ``We want to call attention to the fact that there's
a huge problem George Bush must face. ... He has been handed this
legacy by former President Reagan and he has to handle it.''
   Signs lofted by the protesters were direct: ``The government has
blood on it's hands. One AIDS death every half hour.''
   ``I don't think it's appropriate at all,'' said Tom Aubrey of the
American Bankers Association, one of 12,000 guests at the nationally
televised gala featuring Frank Sinatra, Chuck Yeager, Loretta Lynn
and Randy Travis, among others. ``I don't think a celebratory
evening is the time or place for this kind of demonstration.''
   ``I think they like trying to rain on somebody else's parade,''
commented Doug Richardson, who works with the transition for
Transportation Secretary-designate Samuel Skinner.
   Jeff Vogt of Arlington, Va., who has been tapped for a job in the
White House public liaison office, asked for ``Silence, please. ...
There's a time and place for it.''
   Protesters angry with GOP policies of all kinds are staging
alternative events throughout the week.
   So far, the protests have been peaceful.
   A gathering of hundreds Wednesday night outside Union Station,
where some 2,500 Republicans attended a $1,500-a-plate gala,
featured free food and chants such as ``What about the homeless?,''
but no violence.
   That was the plan, said an organizer of the Counter-Inaugural
Coalition for a People's Agenda, which has some 80 member groups
ranging from the Gray Panthers to the Committee in Solidarity with
the People of El Salvador.
   The coalition's members, including the gay and lesbian rights
groups demonstrating Thursday night, had agreed in advance not to
conduct any civil disobedience.
   ``We want to ensure that we maintain a positive attitude,''
coalition spokeswoman Lisa Fithian said.
   Thursday night, a ``No Honeymoon'' concert benefiting the
Christic Institute, which has sued the U.S. government over its
Central America policies and activities, charged $25 per ticket.
Entertainers David Crosby and Graham Nash were featured.
   Demonstrators planned to be out in force Inauguration Day, along
with the National Organization for Women, which has scheduled a
silent protest along the parade route.
   The NOW demonstrators were to wear buttons numbered 1 to 1,000
that light up in rebuke to Bush's oft-stated reliance on ``a
thousand points of light.'' The buttons will carry the message
``Keep Abortion Legal.''
   ``We want Mr. Bush to know this is a re-mobilization, that we're
not going to stand by and see what little rights we have whittled
away,'' said NOW spokeswoman Junior Bridge.
   Bridge said a survey of the parade route revealed little access
to those without tickets. ``The public is obviously not a welcome
part of this inauguration,'' she said.
   The northwest corner of Lafayette Square, across the street from
the White House, has been set aside for demonstrations, but there is
no hour-by-hour schedule of who will be able to use the space.
   ``The extravagance of George Bush's inauguration _ by far the
most expensive in U.S. history _ demonstrates how far removed the
Bush-Quayle administration is from the concerns and worries of most
American people,'' Fithian said.
   Courtney Miller, an organizer with Justice for Janitors, part of
the coalition, noted that his people have a role in the inauguration
festivities, but not one that gets much attention.
   ``These are the people who will be at the inaugural parties after
the glitz and glitter is shut down,'' Miller said.
   The coalition, whose slogan is ``1,000 Sparks of Dissent,
Inaugurate a People's Agenda,'' plans a Counter-Inaugural Ball at
the Crispus Attucks Museum on Friday night, with a $6 to $10
admission. On Saturday, the coalition will hold a Counter-Inaugural
Forum at All Soul's Church, followed on Sunday by an interfaith
gathering outside the National Cathedral featuring traditional
Native American prayers from representatives of the Piscataway
nation.
   The coalition's groups include: American Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee; Anti-Fur Coalition; DC Statehood Party; Student Coalition
Against Apartheid and Racism; Environmental Action; Jobs With Peace;
National Coalition for the Homeless; National Gay and Lesbian Task
Force; National Pledge of Resistance; Peace Park Anti-Nuclear Vigil;
Socialist Party, USA; United Farm Workers; Vietnam Veterans Against
the War; Women Strike for Peace and Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom.
   Many of those groups, as well as Mitch Snyder of the Community
for Creative Non-Violence, have called on Bush to ask those who
donated money for the inauguration to donate an equal amount to
solve some of the problems facing the country.
   And some just want the nation's policies changed.
   Ken Butigan of the National Pledge of Resistance said, ``George
Bush, read our lips. The U.S. war in Central America must end. ...
What Ronald Reagan learned during eight years was that there is no
mandate for war.''
   Daniel Becker, legislative counsel of Environmental Action,
called on Bush to change the policies of the administration he has
served for eight years ``that showed marked hostility to
environmental protection.''

   A hearing on whether Ferdinand Marcos is too sick
to stand trial on racketeering charges was interrupted Thursday with
word that the deposed Philippine president had suffered a collapsed
left lung.
   In Honolulu, Marcos' doctors said his condition had improved and
he was listed as stable, said hospital spokewoman Norma Kop at 4:15
p.m. Earlier, Marcos' doctors said he was in guarded condition.
   Ms. Kop said Marcos would remain in the hospital's intensive care
unit through Friday, she said.
   The hearing was to resume Friday. But U.S. District Judge John F.
Keenan said at the end of the day that, if reports from Hawaii were
correct: ``There is no way in the world he is going to be arraigned
in a courtroom in the next couple of weeks _ or maybe months.''
   Prosecutors in New York were cross-examining a doctor who had
testified that Marcos was a ``dying man,'' too ill to be brought to
trial, when a FBI agent entered with a note on the 71-year-old
former president.
   After conferring with lawyers in his chambers, Keenan announced
that Marcos' left lung collapsed that morning and that he was
returned to the intensive care unit at St. Francis Medical Center in
Honolulu, where he has been since Sunday with pneumonia and
bronchial asthma.
   Keenan said doctors had been able to reinflate Marcos' lung and
added, ``I also understand there was an additional cardiological
problem.''
   ``He's doing much better now,'' Wong said. Asked if Marcos was
out of danger, the doctor said, ``I think so. If he weren't, I'd
still be in there.''
   Later, Ms. Kop said Marcos was resting and sleeping in the
intensive care unit. She said that during the lung collapse episode,
there were indications Marcos suffered a heart irregularity or
arrythmia.
   Wong said he couldn't say how long Marcos would remain in
intensive care. Marcos' wife, Imelda, was at his bedside, hospital
officials said.
   Mrs. Marcos, dressed in black, left the hospital at 12:50 p.m.
HST and refused to answer questions while she walked to her black
limousine.
   Keenan is to determine if Marcos is fit to stand trial on charges
he stole $103 million from his country. Marcos and his wife have
been living in Hawaii since their ouster in a popular uprising in
1986.
   Since his indictment in October, Marcos had asked that the
arraignment be moved to Hawaii for health reasons. He has had two
kidney transplants and has been hospitalized three times in the past
two months, twice for congestive heart failure.
   On Wednesday, Marcos' attorneys argued that the leader was now
too ill to be arraigned anywhere.
   Before the hearing was interrupted Thursday, Dr. Robert Eliott, a
cardiologist, testified for the defense that he was shocked by
Marcos' physical condition when he examined him earlier in the week
at the Honolulu hospital.
   ``He was unable to complete a sentence without stopping and
gasping,'' Eliot said. The doctor, who went to Hawaii to give Marcos
a stress test, said Marcos was suffering from heart failure and
kidney problems.
   ``To make a long story short, I felt this was a dying man,'' he
said.
   The Marcoses are accused of plundering their homeland, funneling
the money into foreign bank accounts and using it to buy prime New
York real estate and art. Mrs. Marcos was arraigned in New York in
October and released on $5 million bond.

   Authorities investigating the stabbing death
of Oregon's corrections chief said Thursday they are focusing on the
possibility he was slain by a former inmate bent on revenge.
   Michael Francke, 42, who was found dead outside his office early
Wednesday, had received death threats ``on a regular basis,'' a
friend said.
   District Attorney Dale Penn said Thursday many leads were being
pursued and one motive could be revenge connected with Francke's
work in Oregon or New Mexico.
   Francke was head of New Mexico's prisons before coming to Oregon
about 19 months ago.
   Investigators had no suspects and no weapon was found at the
scene. Penn said police where looking into whether any recently
released inmates had a motive.
   An autopsy showed Francke died of a stab wound to the heart.
   Former state Rep. Chuck Sides, a friend of Francke's, said the
corrections chief made comments about death by stabbing several
weeks ago.
   ``I can't remember what brought it up, but he told me exactly how
a person would die with a stab through the heart,'' Sides said.
``Basically, he showed me with his own hand how you would do that.''
   Francke apparently stayed after a staff meeting ended Tuesday
evening and was killed sometime before midnight in the parking lot,
Penn said.
   Sides said the corrections chief had shown him a letter
threatening his life last fall.
   Sides said he could remember no details of that letter but that
Francke shrugged it off with a joke about which legislator might
have sent it.
   ``Michael was getting death threats on a regular basis,'' Sides
said. ``It was part of the job, almost.''
   Sides said Francke had told him he was glad to have left the New
Mexico Correction Department because of death threats there.
   Gov. Neil Goldschmidt on Wednesday named Francke's top aide,
corrections manager Dick Peterson, to serve as interim director.

   Patrick Purdy, the gunman who killed five
Southeast Asian children in a crowded schoolyard, had no grudge
against any particular ethnic group, just ``a hate for everybody,''
police said Thursday.
   Thirty other people were wounded in Tuesday's attack at Cleveland
Elementary School, which ended when Purdy _ a loner with drug and
alcohol problems and a fascination with all things military _ killed
himself.
   Most of his victims were children of Southeast Asian refugees,
but Capt. Dennis Perry said: ``Through his lifetime, Mr. Purdy
developed a hate for everybody.''
   Perry said Purdy's enemy list apparently varied from day to day.
He might be mad at one group but ``the next day if he talked to Joe
Dokes and he talked about the Lebanese ... he probably didn't like
them either.''
   Purdy was described as a danger to himself and others and
suffering from ``mild mental retardation'' in a mental health report
prepared after his arrest in El Dorado County in 1987, Perry said.
Arrested for firing at trees with a pistol, he tried to hang himself
and slit his wrists while in custody, authorities said.
   Perry described Purdy, who attended the school as a boy, as a
``loner, no friends, no particularly known girlfriends, a problem
with alcohol, a problem with marijuana and a distinct dislike for
everybody _ not a particular race, everybody.''
   ``In a way he beat us, because we'll never know'' why he did it,
said Perry, chief of the investigation.
   Purdy, 26, slipped into the schoolyard after detonating a pipe
bomb in his battered station wagon. He fired more than 100 bullets
with a Chinese-made semi-automatic AK-47 assault rifle before taking
his own life with a pistol.
   The five youngsters killed were all children of Southeast Asian
refugees.
   Hospital officials said a 6-year-old boy wounded in the groin was
upgraded from serious to stable condition Thursday; seven pupils
were in stable condition, and six others, including a teacher, were
listed in fair condition. Four more people were discharged from
hospitals Thursday, officials said.
   Steve Sloan, who worked with Purdy at a Stockton machine shop,
said Thursday he remembered a conversation in which Purdy expressed
his dismay at how well Vietnamese refugees were treated in the
United States.
   ``We allow Vietnames to come in and we give them a place of
residence and a car and money and help to find a job,'' Sloan said
in describing Purdy's attitude.
   ``I'm sure he did'' harbor a dislike for Vietnamese, Sloan added,
but said Purdy never singled out any racial or ethnic groups.
   ``He expressed hatred and bitterness and anger towards just about
anybody who asked him to do something,'' Sloan said, adding that
Purdy appeared to feel he was being ``dealt a short deck.''
   ``It always seemed like he was on the edge of snapping,'' he said.
   Perry said autopsy results on Purdy would not be available until
next week, but that there was no immediate evidence of hard drug use.
   Purdy had purchased a number of weapons in the past four years,
including several small-caliber pistols and a 9mm semi-automatic
MAC-10, Perry said.
   In the shabby motel room where Purdy lived his last few weeks,
police found about 100 toy soldiers and other military toys and a
camouflage cloth scrawled with grimacing faces.
   When he attacked the school, he was wearing an olive drab T-shirt
with the Iranian battle cry ``Death to the Great Satin,'' an
apparent misspelling of Satan.
   A close friend of Purdy's in 1987 and 1988 said Purdy would drink
heavily and plunge into dark moods ``where he didn't want to live.''
   ``He'd get into these attitudes where he wouldn't want to talk to
anybody,'' said Kelley Riley, 25. ``He had a bizarre attitude, kind
of paranoid. ... He wanted to make it on his own (as a welder) but
he couldn't. He'd get upset at things. He'd get mad at himself.''
   Meanwhile, more Cleveland Elementary students returned to class
Thursday. The school reported 674 students in attendance, three
times the number who showed up the day after the shooting. The
school has 975 students.
   Counselors wearing yellow armbands continued their work of trying
to minimize the children's trauma.
   Phitsamay Phenegpahnt, an 8-year-old third-grader, wasn't
enthusiastic about returning to school. ``I scared. Man shoot, shoot
at me,'' she said.
   ``She is real quiet, but she talks about the school shooting
every time,'' said her father, Somsack, who walked her to school.
``She watches the news on TV.''

   Trading records of the Chicago Board of Trade and
Chicago Mercantile Exchange were subpoenaed Thursday in an FBI probe
of alleged widespread fraud at the nation's two biggest futures
exchanges.
   The U.S. attorney's office subpoenaed all trading records dating
to Jan. 1, 1983, Mercantile spokesman Andrew Yemma said.
   Similar records were subpoenaed at the Board of Trade and the
Board of Trade Clearing Corporation, said spokesman Raymond
Carmichael, adding that executives ``must and will'' comply with the
request.
   FBI agents posed as traders in the probe focusing on 50 to 100
brokers, traders and executives at the Merc and Board of Trade, the
Chicago Tribune reported Thursday, citing unidentified sources.
   In Chicago, FBI spokeswoman Diane Rivers and Assistant U.S.
Attorney Daniel Gillogly in Chicago would neither confirm nor deny
such an investigation was under way.
   In Washington, however, law enforcement officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity, confirmed the Justice Department was
investigating allegations of fraud at the two exchanges.
   ``We are now aware of an investigation and we intend to cooperate
with it,'' Yemma said.
   Chicago Merc attorney Jerrold Salzman said he was contacted late
Wednesday by several traders who had been subpoenaed by the FBI.
   However, the Board of Trade ``has no knowledge of surveillance
activities of any nature being conducted on the trading floors or
any other Board of Trade location,'' Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said
in a statement Thursday.
   Over a two-year period, investigators secretly tape-recorded
hundreds of conversations on the exchanges' trading floors, the
Tribune said.
   Investigators believe traders cheated customers out of millions
of dollars in the execution of buy-and-sell orders at the exchanges,
which deal in a variety of contracts for delivery of grains,
livestock, Treasury bonds, foreign currencies and other commodities,
the newspaper said.
   Several subpoenas were served Wednesday, but arrests or
indictments were at least a month away, the Tribune reported.
   Investigators believe some trades were rigged to keep customers
from getting fair-market prices and some brokers sent false reports
to customers to hide the skimming of profits of overcharges on
commissions, the Tribune said.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that
regulates futures trading, had no comment, said spokesman David Gary
in Washington.

Trade Commission's bureau of economics and from 1982 to 1983, she
was assistant director of the office.
   Bush's office also said former Sen. David K. Karnes, who was
defeated in his election bid for the Senate by Bob Kerrey in
November, would be nominated as chairman of the Federal Agricutural
Mortgage Corp.
   Other nominations included:
   Anne E. Brunsdale, chairwoman of the International Trade

   The man with the microphone was preaching Jesus
through a battered speaker near the Liberty City checkpoint. ``His
love is e-e-e-ternal,'' he intoned as police checked motorists in
the garish light of flares and squad car flashers.
   A few miles north, officers in helmets and flak vests closed in
on a house that might have been the source of gunfire, while fellow
officers laughed and lounged a hundred feet away.
   The streets of Miami's Overtown and Liberty City neighborhoods
were a little easier Wednesday night. But they were still far from
normal.
   The looting and gunfire that punctuated the past two nights was
muted. Police were still out in force. They wore body armor and
toted loaded shotguns, but this night they sipped sodas and snacked
on sandwiches and ice cream as their radios occasionally crackled
with reports of car fires, smashed store windows and rock throwing.

   Americans have read his lips but expect George
Bush to break his pledge of no new taxes, although a solid majority
likes him anyway, a national poll has found.
   Bush made opposition to taxes a cornerstone of his presidential
campaign, and six in 10 respondents to the Media General-Associated
Press poll agreed he should not seek a tax increase. But 71 percent
said they think he will.
   Even still, the survey found high approval ratings for Bush, who
takes office Friday as the 41st president. Respondents voiced high
expectations for his presidency and gave him strong marks for his
cabinet choices.
   A solid 59 percent said they viewed Bush favorably, precisely the
same approval rate President Reagan received in a Media General-AP
poll last spring. Only 25 percent rated Bush unfavorably; the rest
withheld judgment.

   A woman describing herself as the best
friend of a schoolyard killer whose clothes and guns bore radical
Islamic slogans says his struggle to cope plunged him into dark
moods ``where he didn't want to live.''
   ``He had a bizarre attitude, kind of paranoid,'' said Kelley
Riley, whom residents of the area described as Patrick E. Purdy's
frequent companion in late 1987 and early 1988. ``He wanted to make
it on his own (as a welder) but he couldn't. He'd get upset at
things. He'd get mad at himself.''
   However, she said, Purdy was ``nice'' most of the time, would
``just walk away when he was mad,'' was never violent toward anyone
and never demonstrated an unusual interest in guns.
   Authorities concede they may never know why Purdy, described as a
drifting loner with a long criminal record, returned to the school
of his youth in army clothes and sprayed rifle fire at a playground
full of pupils Tuesday, killing five, wounding 29 children and one
teacher and then killing himself.

   Psychologists say mass murderers like the
drifter who sprayed rifle fire at his boyhood school are part of a
recent unprecedented wave of ``grandstand suicides'' expressing a
hair-trigger anger at the world.
   But some experts warn that such acts of violence, whether they
represent a copycat trend or are only isolated incidents, should not
turn the nation's schools into ``armed camps.''
   The issue took on new significance as police investigated the
motivations of Patrick Purdy, a drifter who returned to his former
elementary school on Tuesday and opened fire on a crowd of children,
killing five students and wounding 30 people before killing himself.
   ``For these people, it is typically their last chance to show
society how angry they are,'' Michael Mantell, chief psychologist
for the San Diego Police Department,'' said Wednesday. ``Striking
out at children is their way of building up their flagging egos by
taking out their frustration on young victims.''

   A new kind of surgery can correct a
common heart rhythm abnormality that is the underlying cause of
225,000 disabling strokes in the United States each year, its
developer said.
   The experimental procedure cures a disorder known as atrial
fibrillation, which affects an estimated 1.5 million to 2 million
Americans.
   Although the strokes that result from this problem can sometimes
be prevented with blood-thinning drugs, that treatment is often
ineffective and may itself cause unwanted bleeding.
   The new technique was developed by Dr. James L. Cox of Washington
University School of Medicine, who described it Wednesday at a
meeting of the American Heart Association. Slices are made in the
atria, the two upper pumping chambers of the heart.

   Researchers today reported the first ``very
promising'' evidence outside a test tube that an experimental new
treatment will slow the lethal spread of the AIDS virus inside the
body.
   The medicine, CD4, apparently works as a decoy, mimicking the
blood cells that the virus usually infects and kills.
   In a report in today's journal Nature, researchers reported that
the treatment dramatically reduced the level of virus in monkeys
infected with the simian version of the AIDS virus.
   ``This is the first evidence in vivo (in a living animal) that it
has anti-viral effects with chronic administration in a relevant
animal model,'' said Dr. Robert Schooley of Massachusetts General

   Garlic and onions can put a crimp in your
social life, but they also could provide unexpected protection
against cancer, according to a study published by the National
Cancer Institute.
   The study compared foods eaten by stomach cancer victims with the
diet of healthy people in Linqu, China. Researchers found that the
strong-smelling vegetables ``can significantly reduce the risk of
stomach cancer.''
   Published this week in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute, the study says researchers used questionnaires to compare
the dietary habits of 685 patients with stomach cancer with those of
1,131 other people, matched by age, gender, occupation and
education, who had no diagnosed cancer.
   People in the cancer-free group each year consumed at least 25
and sometimes more than 50 pounds of allium vegetables, a genus
which includes onions, garlic, leeks, chives, ramps and scallions.
   The cancer patients generally ate less than 25 pounds of the
vegetables.

   President Reagan leaves an America that's
older, eats less red meat, gives birth to fewer babies, is less
likely to divorce and has 16,741,546 more residents than when he
took over the White House eight years ago.
   The Census Bureau estimated the population at 246,879,546 as of
Jan. 1 of this year. When Reagan took office in 1981, it stood at
230,138,000.
   That means an increase of 16,741,546 people in eight years. Or a
population growth of 5,749 people-a-day under the Reagan
administration.
   Just as well, because the extra wage earners will be needed to
help pay a national debt which grew sharply over the period, rising
from $994 billion in 1981 to an anticipated $2.87 trillion by the

   The rate of increase in consumer prices held
steady in 1988 at 4.4 percent, the government said Thursday, but
many economists are warning that inflation could accelarate
moderately this year.
   Although the rise in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index
last year was identical to the 1987 gain, the reasons were very
different.
   The summer drought pushed food prices up by 5.2 percent in 1988,
compared with 3.5 percent a year earlier. Last year's gain was the
steepest since 1980. Consumers got a break on energy costs, which
rose a scant 0.5 percent, compared with 8.2 percent in 1987.
   The inflation rate excluding the volatile food and energy
catagories _ a compilation many economists say is a better gauge of
underlying inflationary pressure than the larger index _ did
accelarate, from 4.2 percent in 1987 to 4.7 percent last year.

   What happened on his fifth mercy mission remains a mystery, but
other Western hostages freed since he vanished have reported seeing

   New rumors crop up almost every week: He was killed trying to
escape Shiite Moslem extremists who held him; he was smuggled to
Iran in a coffin to stand trial as an American spy; he will be
ransomed for $7 million.
   No group has claimed to hold Waite. The British government, which

made. No photographs or videotapes have been released to prove he is
alive.

   Heart disease patients who smoke are three times
more likely to have chest pains and restricted blood flow to their
hearts than those who don't light up, researchers say in a study
touted as the long-sought ``smoking gun.''
   The finding is the first direct evidence linking cigarettes and
heart disease, said an editorial accompanying the study in Friday's
Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The data indicated smokers were more likely than non-smokers to
have angina, or chest pains, and painless periods of inadequate
blood flow to the heart, both called ischemic episodes, the
researchers said.
   These episodes lasted longer among smokers, whose median episode
was 24 minutes compared to 2 minutes for non-smokers, the study
said. Both frequency and duration increased as the number of
cigarettes increased, the study said.

Eduard Shevardnadze as ``encouraging.'' U.S. arms negotiator Stephen
Ledogar said the speech was ``very upbeat, very positive,'' but
warned against reading more into the statement than the Kremlin
intended.
   Shevardnadze's speech came on the final day of a gathering that
produced a 35-nation human rights accord. Shevardnadze said the
agreement was the product of a changing relationship between East
and West.

   Benny O'Berry's side-by-side businesses in Miami's
Liberty City section survived the 1980 and 1982 riots unscathed. But
Tuesday night, one of them, a grocery operated by an Arab family for
a year, was looted and burned to the brick.
   ``There's no doubt about it. If they had known I still own the
building, they would have never torched it,'' said O'Berry, a black
businessman whose driving school next door was untouched.
   As the dust settled in Liberty City and Overtown, shopkeepers in
the predominantly black neighborhoods shoveled up debris and counted
up their losses Thursday.
   Business owners and a black community activist said it was clear
black-owned businesses were spared and others specifically targeted
during three nights of rioting.

only if the nation faced a crisis so severe that there was no
alternative.
   Darman, at his confirmation hearing, sought to fend off Democrats
probing whether Bush might circumvent his presidential campaign
pledge to seek no new taxes, perhaps by using a different name for
revenue raisers.
   ``I think the president meant no new taxes as it would ordinarily
be understood by ordinary Americans,'' Darman told the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee. ``I think the burden of that is the

   At least 20 percent of American adult men have
had one or more homosexual experiences, and a minimum of 3.3 percent
have such contacts with some frequency, according to a study by the
National Research Council.
   The study, an analysis of data collected by questionnaires in
1970 and in a 1988 national survey, suggests that the minimum number
of American men who have had at least one homosexual experience is
lower than the estimates compiled 40 years ago by famed sex

<BYLINE>By DAVID GERMAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The image of a dour, shoeless English boy
and his absent, carefree mother prompted Julia Baird and Geoffrey
Giuliano to collaborate on a book.
   The boy is the public image of young John Lennon, Baird's
half-brother and Giuliano's idol. But the neglected urchin and his
live-it-up mother _ who was also Baird's mother _ never existed, the
authors say.
   ``That woman laughing, singing, dancing, saying goodbye to John,
and John standing there alone crying `Mummy, Mummy!' That's not my
brother, that's not my mother, that's not my children's
grandmother,'' said Baird, who recently spent three weeks in the
United States promoting her book, a family portrait of Lennon and
his Liverpool roots.
   Published in North America last fall, ``John Lennon, My Brother''
was co-authored by Giuliano, a Beatles aficionado who lives in this
Erie Canal city about 25 miles north of Buffalo.
   The two-year, cross-Atlantic collaboration came from two
different motives. Giuliano wanted to do a book about Lennon. Baird
wanted to do a book about the ex-Beatle's maligned mother, whose
name also was Julia.
   The result is a little of both, a mishmash of anecdotes showing a
moody but generally happy Liverpool boy singing with his mother in a
bathroom with good acoustics.
   Baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his
father decamped and Julia turned her son over to her sister, Mimi,
Lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother.
   ``I didn't do it for John,'' said Baird. ``I wanted to set the
record straight about our mother, and that ties in with John. I feel
my mother has been badly misrepresented in the press.''
   Baird, a 41-year-old teacher in Cheshire, England, was born seven
years after Lennon to Julia and her common-law second husband, John
Dykins. She and her younger sister, Jacqui, grew up with their
parents amid an extended family of aunts, uncles, cousins _ and big
brother John.
   The book tells of the sisters getting hauled out of the bathtub
when teen-agers Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison drop by
for bathroom jam sessions with Julia. It tells of an alternately
thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his step-sisters at
the movies for hours while he goes on a date, who between songs at a
Beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the Dykins girls
out of the front row, away from screaming fans threatening to storm
the stage.
   But mostly it tells of a mother and son who, while living apart,
had a loving relationship.
   The book got its start after Baird watched a British television
special in 1985 marking the fifth anniversary of Lennon's murder.
The show presented Julia ``as an unfit mother, no mother at all,''
Baird said.
   Baird complained and was urged to tell her story. She wrote an
essay and arranged to publish it in Liverpool. Then she met
Giuliano, who was in Liverpool to promote his first book, ``The
Beatles: A Celebration.''
   Giuliano, 35, a self-proclaimed huckster, convinced Baird to work
with him on a book, which he pieced together from interviews with
Baird in England. While proofreading the text, Baird sent a copy to
McCartney. He sent his blessing, plus a bonus: a brief foreword for
the book.
   With a collection of rare early photos, the book is more a family
album than a biography. Giuliano's text reads like oral history, as
if a British schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across
the reader's knees to boast about her brother, the musician.
   However, the book is a narrow view of Lennon, a child's
recollections of an aspiring brother. After Julia was killed in a
traffic accident in 1958, Baird saw less and less of Lennon, losing
contact with him for years when he and wife Yoko Ono moved to the
United States. The end of the book describes what Baird calls
Lennon's desire to regain his lost Liverpool roots, when she and her
step-brother exchanged letters and phone calls during 1975-80.
   Baird has been accused of cashing in on her step-brother but
insists she just wants to tell the family's story of Lennon's early
years.
   ``I could have cashed in when John was alive,'' Baird said.
``When John died the tabloids in England were knocking on the door
saying, `Write your story, name your price.' We quickly showed them
the door.''
   Also shown the door was Albert Goldman, whose sordid biography,
``The Lives of John Lennon,'' hit bookstores about the same time as
Baird's book. Baird, who read Goldman's scathing biography of Elvis
Presley, said she turned down an interview with Goldman, who brands
Lennon homosexual, anorexic and possibly a murderer.
   ``I had heard Goldman was doing the book six years ago, and I
knew what the tone would be,'' Baird said. ``Most people, including
Goldman, write books based on other books that have it all wrong.''
   Giuliano was harsher.
   ``Goldman was in it for the money from day one,'' Giuliano said.
``Goldman knows the formula: the more sleaze, the more dough. So
what's his motive? If he writes the sleaziest book he makes the most
dough.''
   Baird herself wasn't blind to the business end of publishing. She
agreed to change the title from ``My Brother John'' to ``John
Lennon, My Brother.''
   The cover's look-alike photos of Baird and Lennon in granny specs
also help, but she said she didn't don them to sell books. They're
on the National Health, Britain's medical plan, and she and Lennon
inherited their mother's short-sightedness, Baird said.
   The book itself is a loving look through rose-colored specs of a
brother whose art touched millions.
   ``It's not a major biography,'' Giuliano said. ``This book is a
little slice out of a big pie, out of a big life. It offers a lot of
previously unknown details on Lennon's early life. It's a
sympathetic view, sure, but what's not to love?''

<HEAD>Actor-Turned-Author Writes Valentines To Beatles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GERMAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geoffrey Giuliano is on the track to
Hollywood stardom with a stopover in a mansion on the Erie Canal
where he's writing portraits of the artists who influenced him.
   At the moment, the actor-turned-author is writing his fourth book
on the Beatles, ``Dark Horse: The Secret Life of George Harrison.''
   Five years ago, Giuliano was living in Toronto, out of work and
out of money. The 35-year-old had played roles from Shakespeare to
Ronald McDonald on stages from England to Florida. He had cut two
offbeat rock albums, developed a pilot for a British comedy TV show
and exhibited his collage art across Canada. He also had met George
Harrison and Paul and Linda McCartney, and interviewed Yoko Ono and
Sean Lennon for Playgirl magazine.
   Still he was broke. On a whim, he called a publisher in Toronto,
saying he had one of the world's largest collections of Beatles
artifacts, inside contacts with the musicians and were they
interested in a book?
   They were, and the result was ``The Beatles: A Celebration,'' a
slick, oversized Valentine of a book published in 1986 by Methuen
Publishing in Canada and St. Martin's Press in the United States.
   His next book, ``My Brother, John Lennon,'' written with the
slain Beatle's step-sister Julia Baird, came out last fall.
Giuliano's ``Tomorrow Never Knows: The Beatles' Recorded Rarities,''
is in production, and a Canadian publisher, Stoddard General, has
bought the Harrison biography.
   The book will be the authoritative biography, ``the one-stop
shopping place'' for those seeking information on Harrison, Giuliano
boasts.
   Giuliano, his wife, and their three children moved to Lockport
two years ago, living in an 1850s canalside mansion he bought and
restored with his book profits. The mansion has become something of
a monastery, he says. After ``Dark Horse,'' he plans to scale back
his writing to a book every three or four years so he can focus on
acting.
   He plans to move to Los Angeles next year, hoping to break into
movies and ``bring some intelligence to Hollywood.''
   Giuliano admits he has a bloated ego and turns it on anyone or
anything he lumps in with the modern age of mediocrity: The media
trivializes American life and are largely at fault for making
``people today far more superficial and covetous than their
parents.''
   ``My wife's parents had clear plastic over their furniture. We've
got it over our minds,'' Giuliano said.
   Giuliano's Beatles books have been something of a ``thank you''
to the group that helped him keep the plastic off his own mind. But
``Dark Horse'' will be his last book on the group, he says.
   ``I acknowledge the gift the Beatles gave me,'' Giuliano said.
``I've spent a few years trying to get others to understand them.
But now I want to move on. Already I'm a little embarrassed, I feel
like I've stayed at the fair too long. I've been on the Magical
Mystery Tour long enough.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Still Plan to Seek Money from U.S. for Proposed Dump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bullfrog County, pop. 0, was born at 3
a.m. on the last day of the 1987 Nevada Legislature and died last
year in court.
   The legislators' invention, a new locality levying the state's
highest taxes on the proposed site of the nation's first high-level
nuclear waste dump, proved unconstitutional. But the idea of making
the federal government pay for choosing Nevada lives on.
   ``I don't know of any current proposal out there but I think that
if we have to take the dump we should be compensated for it,''
Assembly Taxation Comittee Chairman Bob Price said as the 1989
session opened Jan. 16.
   Some believe Nevada could begin collecting tax-like fees from the
federal government as it tests the proposed site, whether the
underground repository is built there or not, said Senate Taxation
Committee Chairman Charlie Joerg. ``I think we'd be foolish not to
look into the possibility of collecting money from the government.
We should get some benefit from this.''
   A resolution from the 1987 Legislature resurfaced in the Senate
on opening day this year. It would establish a special tax district
around the site to let the state collect $5 per $100 of assessed
valuation, as if the respository were a private project. The rate is
the maximum allowed by the Nevada Constitution and about three times
the local levy around the proposed tax district.
   Backers of the assessment plan want money in lieu of taxes to
offset the impact on local governments, which would have to provide
housing, education, law enforcement and other services for people
working at the $2 billion dump.
   Assembly Speaker Joe Dini said lawmakers should move cautiously
to avoid sending a signal to Washington that Nevadans are willing to
accept the nation's nuclear garbage. ``We've had advice that if we
try to get money out of the federal government it will weaken our
position to fight the dump.''
   Assemblywoman Myrna Williams introduced a resolution with 35
co-sponsors urging Congress to halt the dump. Williams blasted a
measure introduced in the state Senate to negotiate with the
government, saying, ``It implies consent.''
   In 1987, Congress passed legislation directing the Department of
Energy to concentrate on Yucca Mountain as a place to bury spent
fuel from nuclear power plants. The site 110 miles northwest of Las
Vegas could be licensed in 1995.
   The Legislature responded by carving 144 square miles out of Nye
County as a way to let the state collect the maximum property tax
rate. That could have cost the federal government an estimated $8
million to $25 million a year.
   Bullfrog County _ inhabited by rattlesnakes, coyotes, lynx,
kangaroo rats and lizards, but no humans _ was named after a Nye
County mining district that failed in a bid to become a separate
county nearly 80 years ago. It was given a three-member commission
and a county seat 250 miles away in Carson City.
   Nye County sued the state, challenging Bullfrog's creation on 37
different legal grounds in a 92-page brief. Its major claim was that
because Bullfrog had no residents it had no representative
government and was unconstitutional. It also contended that it was
entitled to any money collected.
   ``Nye County should be compensated more. We have to recognize
mitigating factors because they would be closest to the dump,'' said
Joerg.
   Retired Nevada Supreme Court Justice David Zenoff ruled Feb. 11,
1988, after 30 minutes of oral agruments, that Bullfrog County was
unconstitutional. He said it stretched its legal limits ``every
which way,'' and left too many constitutional issues ``hanging in
the air.''
   The legislator who introduced the Bullfrog County bill, former
Assemblyman Paul May, did not run for re-election.
   Former Gov. Richard Bryan, who signed the bill, was elected to
the U.S. Senate in November. He has vowed to use his new position to
force re-evaluation of the process that singled out Yucca Mountain
from among three candidates. The other two were in Deaf Smith
County, Texas, and near Hanford, Wash.
   The first investigative drilling into Yucca Mountain has been
delayed five months, to November 1989, as government scientists
struggle for the first time with rules that govern civilian nuclear
plants. The Energy Department's weapons-building activities are
exempt from Nuclear Regulatory Commission rules.

<HEAD>New Book Attempts To Ease Fearful Flyers' Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than three years of being grounded
by dread, a nervous but determined Phil DeHart boarded a plane a few
days before Christmas so he could spend the holiday with relatives
in Indiana.
   He wouldn't have been able to get on that jet, he says, if it
weren't for a new book designed to ease fearful flyers' fears.
   ``The book tells you, `The more you understand something, the
less you fear it.' I think that's one of the things that helped
me,'' the 35-year-old painting contractor said.
   ``Fly Without Fear,'' a 172-page psychology paperback written by
the directors of USAir's Fearful Flyers Program, is helping
countless others cope with aviaphobia or just plain apprehension.
Studies show one in six Americans is afraid to fly, making it one of
the two or three things people fear most.
   ``It's the next best thing to the class that we do,'' said Capt.
Frank Petee, a former pilot who is director of special projects for
USAir.
   Petee and Carol Stauffer, a clinical social worker, based ``Fly
Without Fear'' on the seven-week program they launched here in 1975.
Some 3,000 people have taken the course, and 97 percent of them
report success.
   The course is offered in only 10 U.S. cities a year so ``when we
get a call from someone in Minnesota and they're desperate like
these people are, there's nothing to offer them,'' said Ms.
Stauffer. ``Now they have a book.''
   One person helped by the course was Patricia Hass, an editor at
Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., who asked them to write the book. Dodd, Mead
released it in November but Petee and Ms. Stauffer have taken over
distribution from the liquidating publisher.
   Like the program, ``Fly Without Fear'' describes the mechanics of
flying and the reason for turbulence. It also discusses the four
main fears of flying: acrophobia, or fear of heights;
claustrophobia, or fear of closed spaces; fear of crashing or dying;
and fear of not being in control. It suggests relaxation techniques
and other methods for overcoming them.
   The book also emphasizes air safety. An average 18,000 commercial
flights carry 1 million people daily in the United States, generally
without incident, said Ms. Stauffer. ``It's by far the safest way
one can travel.''
   Knowing the odds as well as something about the process of flying
comforted DeHart during a week that unnerved even the most fearless
flyers.
   After twice poring over ``Fly Without Fear,'' DeHart flew Dec. 21
from his home in Phoenix to Indianapolis. That was a few hours
before a bomb aboard Pan American World Airways Flight 103 exploded
in the sky over Scotland.
   He returned Dec. 26 _ the day an Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 was
forced to land in Charleston, W.Va., with a 14-inch hole torn in its
fuselage.
   That's bad timing for anyone, but especially for someone whose
fear stemmed from the misfortune of being at airports within a few
hours or days of crashes.
   DeHart passed through Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on
Aug. 3, 1985, a day after a Delta Air Lines jumbo jet crashed,
killing 137 people. ``I could see all the wreckage out there,'' he
said.
   ``I made a vow to myself I wasn't going to get on another
airplane.''
   Accidents tend to push ``borderline'' fearful flyers over the
edge, said Ms. Stauffer. ``It's just so awesome to think about. If
you already have some fear inside you, brewing there, something like
that is enough to set it off.''
   Petee acknowledges his job undoubtedly will be ``tougher from
here on in'' because of the Pan Am bombing and recent accidents.
   ``Quite often, you have to revert back to the fact that these
things happening like this are so far and few between. They really
are,'' he said. ``When you go back 25 to 30 years, only 2 percent of
accidents were caused by maintenance-related incidents. Only 2
percent.''

<HEAD>George Bush Would Like It: Kinder, Gentler New Series on CBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps to welcome the Bush administration, CBS
offers a kindler, gentler new TV series.
   ``Dolphin Cove,'' premiering Saturday, is a nice family drama
with a splash of sophistication mixed in with all the sappiness.
This is a show for people who still cry at the end of ``Old
Yeller,'' not cynics who watch ``Miami Vice'' in the secret hope
that Tubbs will shoot Crockett.
   Frank Converse stars as Michael Larson, a scientist who moves to
Australia under the aegis of a wealthy businessman who wants to
prove that dolphins are as intelligent as human beings.
   If viewers aren't immediately caught up in the drama of Flipper
fielding flash cards, there are the more accessible concerns of the
scientists' two children _ young Katie, who lost her will to speak
after being in a car wreck that killed her mother, and David, a
sulky teen-ager who wants to go home to his girlfriend in America.
   Trey Ames (``A Year in the Life'') plays David and Karron Graves
is Katie. Nick Tate plays Baron Trent, the sponsor of the research
project, who harbors a secret plan to salvage a valuable ancient
sunken ship.
   Peter Benchley, author of ``Jaws,'' is one of the creators of the
series, which is filmed on location in Australia. He also wrote the
premiere, so it's hard to predict the quality of subsequent episodes.
   Once the family arrives in Australia, they meet hired hand Didge
(Ernie Dingo), an Aborigine who rides horses, flies a helicopter and
generally helps explain the strange new land.
   They settle in, sort of, to mosquito nets _ ``There used to be
vultures, but the mosquitoes ate them,'' Didge explains _ and pizza
topped with alligator meat.
   Larson dives into his work, but two bottle-nosed dolphins in his
care only make fun of him by splashing him with water and squealing
what apparently is dolphinese for ``nyah, nyah, nyah.'' But they
take to silent Katie and establish an E.T.-like rapport with her.
   David, meanwhile, is appalled at being sent, in uniform, to St.
Crispin's, which his father neglected to tell him is an all-boys
school. ``The girls go to St. Somewhere Else,'' Larson explains.
``Oh, good, St. Elsewhere. This gets better all the time,'' sulks
David. The inside joke is a reference to co-executive producer John
Masius, a former writer-producer on ``St. Elsewhere.''
   On to high drama, though, when Katie's new therapist, Allison
Mitchell (Virginia Hey), clumsily makes a reference to her own
mother, causing Katie to run off and swim into the dangerous ocean.
But it is we who are plunged into the depths _ of
Lassie-come-home-ness _ when the wise dolphins leap a barrier and
race out into the deep to rescue the mute child and her teacher.
   If that's not enough to bring tears to your eyes, the episode
ends with Katie watching an old videotaped home movie of her mother.
(Count the number of fathers raising kids alone on TV, and it begins
to look like moms are an endangered species.)
   The dolphins might not speak English, but they sure know how to
overact. If the series goes, they'll no doubt be demanding
renegotiation of their contracts and greater creative control.
   But the human characters seem a likable bunch, and ``Dolphin
Cove'' is not a bad place to visit. And thanks to remote control you
don't have to live there.

   MS. SMITH WATCHES WASHINGTON _ C-SPAN's audience rose 97 percent
in 1988, according to a study by the University of Maryland Survey
Research Center. About 53 percent of households with television that
had access to the public affairs cable network watched some
programming on it during the year. The survey, a telephone poll of
2,379 randomly selected households, revealed that C-SPAN attracted
viewers in 21.9 million households _ it is available in 41.5 million
households. Viewers were younger and more often female than previous
studies indicated _ 54 percent in the 25-44 age range and 51 percent
female. They are a politically active bunch, though. Eighty-four
percent said they were registered and 78 percent said they voted in
the 1988 presidential election. C-SPAN doesn't get television
ratings like everybody else since it is a non-profit service
provided by the cable industry and doesn't carry advertising.

<HEAD>Graham Prays That Bush Have ``Cool Head And Warm Heart''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prayer by evangelist Billy Graham at today's inauguration of
George Bush as U.S. president asks that he be given ``a cool head
and warm heart'' and the ``uncompromising courage'' to do what's
right.
   Although inaugural ceremonies usually feature a cross-section of
religious participants, only the veteran evangelist was singled out
for it this time, asking a divine hand on the new president.
   In ``this momentous hour of our history ... give him the wisdom,
integrity and courage to help this become a nation that is gentle
and kind,'' implores the text of the opening prayer.
   ``Protect him from physical danger. And in the lonely moments of
decision, grant him thy wisdom to know what is morally right, and an
uncompromising courage to do it.
   ``Give him a cool head and a warm heart. Give him a compassion
for those in physical, moral and spiritual need.''
   Graham, asked about being the only clergym commissioners, meeting in
emergency session Wednesday,
appointed a panel with subpoena power to investigate the fatal
shooting of an unarmed, 23-year-old black motorcyclist by a Hispanic
policeman. And the sister of the motorcyclist's passenger, who died
after the vehicle crashed, made a televised appeal for an end to the
violence.
   ``Put down your weapons _ I do not want my brother to be
remembered with the riots,'' Claudia Lubrin said on local television.
   The rioting that followed the killing has left one person dead,
eight shot, about 20 buildings burned and numerous others looted in
the black neighborhoods.
   It also has left image-conscious city officials scrambling to
minimize the impact on Sunday's Super Bowl. The Cincinnati Bengals
remained at their downtown hotel, just blocks from the Overtown
disturbances.
   ``What has happened the last two days has certainly taken the
glitter off the Super Bowl,'' said Dick Anderson, a former Miami
Dolphin player and chairman of a host city committee spending $2
million this week to enhance Miami's image.
   ``That's really what life is over there,'' said Bengals
quarterback Boomer Esiason. ``It really puts this game in
perspective.''
   Police deployed about 450 officers, and worked to meet sporadic
outbreaks of violence with shows of force. ``Field forces'' of
officers clad in bullet-proof vests and riot gear were stationed on
the edge of the riot-torn neighborhoods. Caravans of squad cars
raced through the areas, and SWAT teams searched for troublemakers.
   ``We hope we can normalize and go back to routine patrolling,''
said Deputy Police Chief Walter Martinez. ``We don't like being out
here 12 hours and being shot at.''
   Speaking at the city commission meeting, Mayor Xavier Suarez
apologized to police ``for actions that may have endangered their
lives unduly.''
   Suarez didn't elaborate at the meeting, but he told The New York
Times that he may have erred when he allowed the sister of the dead
motorcyclist to view her brother's body shortly after he was shot
Monday night, the Times reported today. He said her reaction
appeared to incite a group of nearby youths, who showered police
with bottles.
   ``I took the sister over to the deceased,'' Suarez said. ``I
should have done that under more controlled circumstances. All the
kids followed me. Things got out of hand. I don't believe what I did
was the trigger. In fact, I may have helped for a while by going
there and talking to people. But I would have done it differently if
I had it to do all over again.''
   The Times said Suarez later called to say that he had not
intended those comments for publication.
   Black leaders warned Suarez before the commission meeting
Wednesday that their community would no longer accept empty promises
and business as usual.
   ``The word is out that there will be more disturbance,'' said the
Rev. William Washington. ``Now we've got to act and act quick.''
   Commissioners unanimously approved the special panel to
investigate the shooting of Clement Lloyd, who was speeding with a
friend, Allen Blanchard, through Overtown. Blanchard died in a
hospital Tuesday of injuries from the motorcycle crash.
   After discussions, the commissioners approved a suggestion by
Miller Dawkins, the lone black on the five-member commission, who
wanted a board consisting of five policemen and five Overtown
residents, with the mayor as chairman.
   Dawkins said the board will not satisfy the young people throwing
rocks and bottles, and he appealed to them for time.
   ``I'd like to tell them to give us a chance to work this out, and
to work on all our other ills, such as poor housing, poor education,
joblessness,'' he said. ``And they have to work with us instead of
creating other problems like they are doing now.''
   The FBI, the State Attorney's Office and the police internal
review board are also investigating the police shooting. William
Lozano, 29, the Colombian-born police officer who shot the
motorcyclist in the head, was relieved of duty with pay pending the
investigation.
   Anderson said on ABC's ``Nightline'' that his department had
``major concerns'' about the shooting.
   ``There seem to be some unusual circumstances,'' the police chief
said.
   Most schools that closed Tuesday reopened, although attendance
was down.
   Liberty City was the site of a 1980 race riot also linked to the
death of a black motorcylist at the hands of white police officers.
The 1980 uprising left 18 people dead. In 1982, a riot in Overtown
sparked by a police shooting caused millions of dollars of damage to
businesses and buildings.

<HEAD>Salad Bars: Where the Savings Are _ and Aren't</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Convenience-conscious Americans have made salad
bars one of the most popular new supermarket innovations in recent
years, and with some care these shoppers can also realize value for
their money.
   Salad bar ingredients have proven popular not just for salads,
but also as ingredients in stir-fry dishes, side dishes, sandwich
fillings and the raw materials for a hearty soup, say researchers
Eileen Patz Newman and Dianne D. Odland.
   Nutritionists at the Department of Agriculture decided to look
into the growth of supermarket salad bars, and studied those at
markets in the Washington, D.C. area.
   They found that some items, not surprisingly, cost a lot more on
the salad bar than they do if purchased in larger units in other
sections of the market.
   But other items cost about the same, and shoppers could even find
savings on some items at the salad bar, the researchers reported in
the magazine Family Economics Review.
   The difference exists, of course, because salad bars generally
charge one per pound price for whatever ingredients the customer
selects, while prices for the same items bought individually would
vary widely.
   Cucumbers, carrots, green cabbage, yellow onions and watermelon,
for example, were as much as four times more expensive at the salad
bar.
   And salad-bar buyers paid triple the regular price for lettuce,
celery, bean sprouts, red cabbage, zuccini, canned kidney beans and
peas, cole slaw, macaroni salad, potato salad and hard-cooked eggs,
the researchers said.
   Tomatoes, spinach, radishes, green pepper, cantaloupe, sliced
beets, chickpeas, raisins, pineapple, tofu, egg salad and cottage
cheese cost about double if bought at the salad bar.
   On the other hand, mushrooms, cauliflower, broccoli, spring
onions, strawberries, honeydew, grapefruit, peaches, pears,
three-bean salad, pickled beets, salsa and rice pudding cost about
the same at the salad bar as in other supermarket areas.
   And the nutritionists found that shoppers could actually save
money at the salad bar by buying alfalfa sprouts, pineapple,
mandarin orange slices, tuna fish, American cheese, domestic ham,
sunflowwr seeds, croutons, chow mein noodles, jalapeno peppers,
pitted olives and bread pudding.
   While their research concentrated on supermarkets in the
Washington area, shoppers in any part of the country might also find
savings by comparing per-pound costs of salad bar foods to the same
item in other sections.
   A straight price comparison isn't always valid, of course,
because at the salad bar shoppers can buy any quantity of an item
then need, eliminating potential waste.
   This can be especially important for one- and two-person
households or those who prepare meals at home infrequently. Buyers
from those homes need to consider whether they can use an entire
head of cauliflower or carton of cottage cheese, or if much of it
will end up thrown away eventually, negating the saving.
   Another consideration is time, since salad-bar ingredients are
already cut up and prepared. This may be an advantage for the cook
who needs items for a stir-fry dinner and doesn't want to spend the
time slicing and chopping.
   Sale prices and local price differences also make a difference,
the researchers pointed out.
   But the final conclusion is that basic salad ingredients are most
costly at the salad bar while salad toppings and products of animal
origin can offer a saving there.
   Thus, consumers anxious to make the best use of their shopping
dollar, and who have time and storage space, might want to consider
buying items like lettuce, carrots and cabbage at the regular
produce counter, and turning to the salad bar for the extras such as
tuna, ham, sprouts, cheese and croutons.

<HEAD>`Rain Man' Leads List of Films Shot in Nevada in 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You'll forgive Nevada film chief Robert Hirsch
if he shows a special interest in the Academy Award nominations this
year.
   Some of the years leading movies, films likely to capture a
nomination or two, including the hit ``Rain Man,'' used Nevada
locales during 1988 _ a record year for Hirsch's state Motion
Picture Division.
   ``I picked up a copy of Variety the other day and here's this
double page spread promoting `Rain Man' for Oscar nominations,''
Hirsch said proudly, thumbing through the entertainment publication.
``Then I came to this ad for `Midnight Run,' then another for the
film `Things Change.'''
   Significant shooting on the three movies was carried out in
Nevada last year. The three films helped boost Nevada film industry
revenues to $50 million in 1988 _ 10 times the annual revenue
generated before former Gov. Richard Bryan appointed Hirsch to head
the new Motion Picture Division in July 1983.
   ``That's real income, dollars spent in the state by the industry,
with no multipliers applied,'' Hirsch said.
   Hirsch recently issued a glowing report, reflecting Nevada's
growing role in the film industry. A number of top box-office stars
are headed for the state, promising an even bigger year in 1989.
   Twenty-two feature films, 25 television and-or movie projects and
five documentaries used Nevada locations for filming during 1988.
Commercial production increased 400 percent over 1987. Nearly half
of the 52 projects used Southern Nevada locales.
   The year's film highlights included ``Rain Man'' with Dustin
Hoffman; ``Midnight Run,'' which starred Robert DeNiro and Charles
Grodin; Clint Eastwood's ``Pink Cadillac''; ``Far From Home'';
``Bonanza: The Next Generation''; ``Homer and Eddie''; and ``Once
Upon a Texas Train.''
   Other TV films shot in Nevada included ``High Mountain Rangers,''
``Elvis and Me'' and the former hit NBC series, ``Crime Story.''
Other theatrical features included ``Rambo III'' and ``China Lake.''
   Several factors are making Nevada an increasingly attractive
location for filming.
   ``One of the keys is the level of cooperation you get from our
resorts,'' Hirsch said. ``The contribution of the resort industry is
significant. Even if the hotel isn't used in the film, and the
studio is just looking for a place to stay, the hotel costs in
Nevada are half what they would cost in Texas or Colorado.
   ``The motion picture industry is first and foremost a business.
If we can save a company money on such things as hotel rooms, it
gives us an edge.''
   Another factor, according to Hirsch, is the lack of bureaucracy
in Nevada because it is a small state. ``We can get an answer for a
film company in a matter of hours,'' he said. An example was
``Midnight Run.'' Hirsch negotiated with authorities to close a
section of busy Interstate 15 southwest of Las Vegas to film a
roadblock segment for the movie.
   One-third of ``Midnight Run'' was filmed in Nevada. A significant
portion of ``Rain Man'' was also filmed in the state, much of it
during a month-long stint at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas last summer.
   The movie features the glitz and pizzazz of the Las Vegas Strip
and the world-famous resort, but it also captured on film some less
famous Southern Nevada locales. The tiny town of Blue Diamond,
southwest of the city, got a new laundromat front for one scene. A
diner in tiny Pahrump, 50 miles west of Las Vegas, was refurbished
for another scene.
   The diverse locales offered in Nevada is a major selling point
Hirsch hammers home to movie production companies _ from the glamour
and excitement of Las Vegas to nearby desert landscapes, and the
scenic Sierra Nevada in the northern part of the state.
   ``This is an exciting place to be and it has a vast appeal to the
Hollywood mentality,'' Hirsch said of the Las Vegas area. ``Desert
is desert, whether it's outside of Las Vegas, in Arizona or the high
desert of Colorado. But most people would rather spend their
off-time in Las Vegas if they had their choice.''
   Several major films are scheduled for shooting in Nevada in the
upcoming months.
   _ Tom Selleck will be shooting ``Hard Rain,'' a movie for the
Disney Co. that also features Ben Kingsley.

<HEAD>Their Songs Are Question Marks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Though mainstream radio has so far chosen to
resist the songs of They Might Be Giants, the biting lyrics and
unique music of guitarist John Flansburgh and accordion player John
Linnell have helped the two-man band build a substantial following.
   ``Our songs are question marks,'' Linnell said. ``We leave a lot
more stuff hanging out than other bands.''
   The music is simple, catchy and deceptively cheerful. ``Shoehorn
With Teeth'' could almost be mistaken for a toothpaste commercial if
it weren't for the lyrics: ``He wants a shoehorn, the one with
teeth. People should get beat up for stating their beliefs.''
   And ``Kiss Me, Son of God'' would fit right into a glee club
recital if someone could find a way around these words: ``Now I
laugh and make a fortune off the same ones that I tortured and the
world screams, `Kiss me, son of God.'''
   ``I think what's weird about our songs is that they work much
more on a synmbolic level than on a literal level,'' Flansburgh
said. ``I'm not trying to make it more poetic than it really is.
We're not too concerned about being really explicit. I think it's
better for a person listening.''
   Linnell and Flansburgh grew up in the suburbs of Boston and
became friends in high school.
   ``We hung out with a clique of people who were like-minded,''
Linnell said. ``We were on the staff of the school newspapaer. The
high school had a newspaper office so we could hang out in the
office and we didn't have to hang out in the hallway.''
   Linnell was the first to show interest in music, playing in high
school bands, but Flansburgh would eventually catch the bug.
   ``I did sort of tape stuff at my own home and started getting
into the punk rock thing,'' Flansburgh said.``Then a friend of mine
gave me a guitar and said, `Play this and you'll never be the
same.'''
   A friend was also the source of Linnell's accordion.
   ``I'd been a keyboard player in other bands, but someone gave me
this accordion and John and I started messing around with that,''
Linnell said. ``I immediately took to it. I think it has the biggest
effect on us on stage. We both have instruments where we can stand
up and move around.''
   After graduating from high school, they went their separate ways,
but reunited in 1981 when both moved to New York and ended up in the
same apartment building. Before long, they were working on songs and
did some home recordings.
   But the two Johns, as they're sometimes called, decided to start
performing and the response was encouraging enough for them to seek
a recording contract.
   ``We were considerably farther off stream when we first
started,'' Linnell said. ``We had done a lot of tapes that weren't
strictly music. Typical sort of high school experimentation. It's
kind of still with us in a way.''
   They still didn't know what to call the group. After trying out
different names, the two Johns were saved by yet another friend.
   ``He was a ventriloquist,'' Flansburgh recalled. ``He had a list
of names for his own performance and one of them was `They Might Be
Giants.' We just decided to rip his name off.''
   Their self-titled debut album came out at the end of 1986 to
nearly unanimous critical acclaim and respectable sales of 100,000
copies.
   ``It was incredibly informal,'' Linnell said. ``All we were doing
was taking tapes we had made and remixing them.''
   Both the first album and ``Lincoln,'' their latest LP, were
released by Bar-None Records, an independent label based in Hoboken,
N.J. ``Lincoln,'' consists of 18 short songs whose titles include
``Purple Toupee'' and ``Snowball in Hell.''
   ``I don't think we're particulary good at writing 10-minute, free
improvisational songs,'' Flansburgh said. ``What we do is really a
normal art form. It's two minutes long and it's got to be catchy
somehow. Once you're secure writing in that medium it seems sort of
unlimited.''
   Even if They Might Be Giants has failed to rule the air waves,
the two Johns are certainly kings of the telephone lines.
   When Flansburgh and Linnell were living together in Brooklyn,
Flansburgh came up with the idea of ``Dial-a-Song.'' By phoning
1-718-387-6962, one can reach an answering machine that plays the
latest They Might Be Giants song. There is no additional cost for
the caller, nor does the duo collect a profit.
   It was a way for people to get our songs without having to leave
their house,'' said Flansburgh, who estimates that Dial-a-Song
receives 100 calls a day.
   ``We didn't want people to go into this incredibly crowded room
with all the smoke. I never went to nightclubs because we're not the
most nightlife-oriented people. We could just relate to people who
worked during the day.''

<HEAD>Chinese Artists Reunite 10 Years After Unprecedented Exhibit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade after their avant-garde exhibition in a
Beijing park shook up the moribund Chinese art world, a group of
pioneering artists has reunited in this British colony for their
first retrospective.
   The youthful Chinese artists, known as ``The Stars,'' shot to
prominence in 1979 when they marched through Beijing to protest
police interference in a show they had set up without official
approval.
   The authorities gave in and allowed the artists to stage the
exhibition, unprecedented in Communist China, that featured
once-forbidden topics such as nudes, abstracts and works of
aesthetic rather than political content.
   After another show in 1980, however, the 30-member group
disbanded. While some remained active in Beijing, others scattered
around the globe, settling in Europe, Japan and the United States.
   Six of the artists were recently in Hong Kong for a retrospective
featuring the work of 12 group members. The exhibition opened
earlier this month in the basement gallery of a posh residential
neighborhood and is scheduled to run for five weeks before moving to
Taipei, Taiwan and Paris.
   Sculptor Wang Keping said The Stars were significant by showing
that artistic activity in China need not be organized or approved by
the ruling party. ``Earlier art was all the same,'' he said.
   Individuality was the driving force behind the group, agrees
Chang Tsong-zung, the owner of Hanart Gallery who organized the
retrospective. ``The only common aim of the artists when they first
started was that they wanted to be different from each other.''
   Bo Yun, a teacher at the Academy of Arts and Design in Beijing
whose abstract scroll paintings are part of the retrospective, said
artistic freedom in China has advanced since the group's landmark
1979 exhibition but limitations remain.
   There is no problem, he said, ``if you use a work of art to
satirize an opponent of the government. But if you mock the
government, I'm afraid that will pose a problem.''
   Members of The Stars also say Beijing no longer allows them to
exhibit as a group, thwarting two attempts in 1983 and 1986. The
reason, believes Bo, is that the group's name has become a symbol of
the democracy movement.
   The retrospective includes works that date from the group's
heyday, including Wang's Buddha-like bust of Chairman Mao Tse-tung
signifying the deification of the Communist leader during the
ultraleftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. It is called ``The Idol.''
   Other pieces adopt obviously current themes, including the
mixed-media work ``Safe Sex'' by Ai Weiwei that features a
prophylactic attached to a rain coat. Prices run from hundreds to
thousands of dollars.
   The works are as different as the paths the artists have taken
since they disbanded after their Beijing exhibitions.
   Wang, 39, a soft-spoken man with a wisp of a goatee who joined
the fanatical Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution, moved to
Paris in 1984, convinced he could not develop further in China
largely because of political pressure. ``Art freedom is only
possible in a democratic country with human rights,'' he said.
   The sculptor lives and works out of a workshop he rents from the
French government and has been featured at the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Paris and the Olympic Sculpture Park in Seoul,
South Korea.
   Wang recently wrote a political play titled, ``The Retrial of Wei
Jingsheng,'' a contemporary of The Stars who led a fledgling
pro-democracy movement in China before being jailed for 15 years in
1979. Wang said the play will be performed in Paris this March.
   Bo, 40, has remained in Beijing although he is considering a move
overseas. He supplements his 150 yuan ($40) a month salary by
selling his paintings to foreigners in China and at overseas
exhibits. He owns a tiny Fiat, a sign of financial well-being in a
country where private cars remain rare.
   Other Stars on display in the retrospective include Huang Rui and
Ma Desheng, the two leaders of the group, and Li Shuang, who was
arrested in 1981 and sentenced to two years of labor re-education
for ``incitement to debauchery.'' When she was arrested, she was
living with a French diplomat but had not yet married him.
   The exhibition includes caligraphy by Zhong Ahcheng, also known
as Ah Cheng, whose fictional work ``The King of Children'' was
translated to film and premiered at the Cannes Film Festival last
year.
   Although The Stars have spread throughout the world they have
stayed in touch with one another. From the heady days of 1979-80 was
forged ``a feeling of brotherhood'' that has not diminished, Bo said.

<TEXT>
   AL-MATARIYA, Egypt (AP) _ Ancient Heliopolis, where legend says
the phoenix was resurrected from its own ashes, is buried or in
ruins. But like the fabulous bird that brought it fame, the city
itself is emerging from the ashes of time.
   Egyptian archaeologists are discovering remains under farmlands,
in the shadow of apartment high-rises, down alleyways and in
mid-campus at Ein Shams University.
   ``So much is left, but there's so much trouble getting to it,''
said Mohammed Abdel-Galil, chief antiquities inspector for
al-Matariya, a crowded suburb six miles north of downtown Cairo. He
is heading the search for ancient Heliopolis, struggling to keep a
step ahead of a critical need for space to accommodate an exploding
population.
   The isolated temple columns, mud-brick houses, fallen obelisk,
decorated tombs with star-studded ceilings and pieces of mummies
hint of the glory of the lost spiritual center the Greeks named
Heliopolis _ City of the Sun. It honored the sun god Re, whose
temple complex dominated ancient Egypt's history.
   An elegant reminder of Heliopolis' past, an obelisk, stands in
New York's Central Park. Its twin, the misnamed ``Cleopatra's
Needle,'' graces the bank of the Thames River in London.
   The most impressive Heliopolis remnant in its original home is a
solitary obelisk of red Aswan granite, erected almost 4,000 years
ago by Pharaoh Senwosret I. It weighs 121 tons and towers more than
67 feet above a quiet park amid the daily hubbub of modern life.
   Gamal Fares Abu-Fares, a young antiquities inspector, plucked a
blue faience statuette from a desecrated brick tomb more than 2,000
years old.
   ``Grave robbers took the valuable things and tossed relics like
this one aside,'' he said. ``The whole area is one vast cemetery.''
   Nearby, an angry-looking man paced back and forth _ the owner of
the construction site where the tomb was discovered.
   ``Every time we find another relic, he shakes his head,''
Abu-Fares said, explaining that it means the owner can do no work
until the excavators finish.
   By law, construction cannot begin in Egypt without a permit from
the Egyptian Antiquities Organization certifying the site's
historical unimportance.
   In al-Matariya, where the probability is high of archaeological
significance, Abu-Fares spends part of each day riding through new
housing areas checking building permits. His reception can be far
from friendly.
   ``Sometimes, we get into fistfights,'' he said.
   Historians fear for the city whose intellect dazzled early
Mediterraneans. It gave the world the obelisk. Its mathematicians
and astronomers created a solar calendar, 365 days divided into 12
months.
   Ancient Heliopolis' high priests created a think tank that
beckoned the leading brains of the day: the law-giver Solon came, as
did the mathematician Pythagoras. Plato spent years absorbing
Heliopolis' storehouse of knowledge.
   The sprawling modern suburb that Cairenes know as Heliopolis lies
southeast of the ancient city, which covered what is now Al-Matariya
and nearby areas.
   For almost 3,000 years of pharaohs, Heliopolis stood undaunted,
bowing only to a brash young Macedonian, Alexander the Great, who in
331 B.C. founded a rival city 130 miles to the north, Alexandria.
   By the time Christianity took hold more than 400 years later,
Heliopolis _ called ``On'' in the Old Testament _ was a ghost town.
Its remains were slowly covered by sand or they were carted away to
build the medieval city of Cairo.
   In legend, ancient Heliopolis lives side-by-side with the
phoenix. That dying magical bird set fire to itself on the altar in
the great temple of Re, and a new phoenix would fly from the ashes
to heaven, a promise to the ancients of resurrection.
   But two years ago, the city became far more than legend to
construction workers digging the foundation for an engineering
school at Ein Shams University, named for the spring where ancient
Egyptians believed the sun took its daily baths morning and night.
   As they dug, they unearthed evidence of a tomb, the first of an
eventual 15 that archaeologists would find.
   On a recent day at the dig, a tin can sat on the ground, holding
hundreds of colorful mummy beads that once adorned the dead. Skulls,
pieces of mummies hacked by grave robbers searching for jewelry and
layers of mummy wrappings were clearly evident in the
cross-sectioned hillside, frozen in time.
   To the din of nearby construction, excavators gingerly removed
remains with picks and shovels.
   A mile away, inspectors are excavating a large cemetery with
tombs decorated for officials 2,500 years ago. Sarcophagi line
uneven ground where a high-rise had been planned.
   Al-Matariya's Abdel-Galil, a soft-spoken man, constantly tours
such excavation sites, trying to piece together the meaning of
relics saved from steam shovel and pile driver. His work takes him
bumping from one rocky road to another, from modern suburb to remote
village, a 10-minute trip through a time tunnel.
   He said the most important find so far is a mile-long double
mud-brick wall separating a suburb from farming fields. According to
surviving accounts of early travelers to ancient Heliopolis, the
wall stretched for more than three miles, surrounding an enormous
city.
   In a quiet village about a mile from the wall, Abdel-Galil walked
among columns heralding the exploits of pharaohs Ramses III and
Ramses IV.
   ``We think a large temple of Ramses III is near here, maybe under
the fields,'' Abdel-Galil said. ``We have to find out, but we have
problems. The villagers don't have a sense of history.''

   Robin Williams traverses the country, ridiculing
Republicans. Ronald Reagan is ``the world's largest Muppet.'' Dan
Quayle is ``the Stepford candidate.'' George Bush is a political
hypnotist: ``T'ousand points of light, watch de watch.''
   People laugh. They reward Williams with ovations. And they elect
Bush.
   ``I don't know, I can't understand it,'' Williams said, in a
recent interview. ``Bush still got elected. ... It was like, `What?
Wait a minute, why?' I kept doing joke after joke, firing. Quayle is
too easy. I mean, it's like shooting bullets into a dead horse.''
   He intends to keep on firing _ at such targets as the Supreme
Court (``some of what you see is trying to write the Constitution on
an Etch-A-Sketch'') and the imperial presidency (there is an effort
to ``turn Congress into this kind of benign boys club. They pass a
law, and it's like ... `What laws? We don't need no stinkin'
laws.''')
   The jokes keep coming, but there is an underlying seriousness to
Robin Williams' wacky world. One measure is the political material
that has been incorporated in his act in recent years; another is
the charity benefits in which he participates.
   This March he will appear on the third-annual HBO ``Comic
Relief'' to raise money for the homeless; on Feb. 6, he will appear
at a New York benefit to raise money for housing and for medical
vans to treat homeless children, a project sponsored by singer Paul
Simon. Tables for the show at the Sheraton Centre sell from $10,000
to $25,000. That kind of ticket puts a lot of pressure on a
performer.
   ``You know the chicken's not what they're paying for,'' he said.
   Williams, 38, is coming off his biggest screen success, ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' in which he portrayed an irreverent Saigon
deejay. He's just completed work on a new film, ``The Dead Poets
Society,'' about a teacher at a private boys school in the 1950s.
   But it was Williams' artistry as a stand-up comic that launched
his career and made him an enormous success.
   He's much in demand on the benefit circuit. His main charities
involve AIDS and the homeless, and he finds himself turning down
worthy causes.
   ``The problem is you don't want to end up being like someone who
would go to the opening of an envelope,'' he said.
   ``You diminish your power; you also diminish your ability to help
the cause if you start doing every cause. Then people go, `Oh, it's
him.' There was a time when I did do every benefit. `Save the
Shrimp' _ he's there! `People, people, listen _ cocktail sauce is a
horrible fate, people!'''
   He tries to find out as much as he can about his causes and
candidates. ``You better know about it, or you'll get creamed.
They'll start asking, `Do you know his stand on the basic budget
deficit?'''
   In a child's voice: ``No. He's a nice guy though. Drives a good
car.''
   He picks his causes from ``gut feeling'' and experience. He has
watched as acquired immune deficiency syndrome struck his friends, a
generation of performing artists. ``It was everybody _
choreographers, designers, everything, gone,'' he said.
   He is proud of a ``Saturday Night Live'' bit he did on condoms.
   ``I was trying to reach people other than people who know about
them, trying to reach 14 year olds: `It's a balloon. I know, it's
difficult. (blowing sound) Use it. Inflate it. Put it on. It's a
bathing cap of love. Don't be afraid.' `Uh, well, I'll lose my
sensitivity.' `Yeah, you're real sensitive. SLAP! Wake up! Wise up,
Sparkie!'''
   Homelessness, too, is an issue he has observed personally. Most
recently, while in New York to perform in Lincoln Center's
production of ``Waiting for Godot,'' he was stopped by panhandlers
each night on the way to the theater.
   ``New York looks like Bombay,'' he said. ``People are stepping
over other people. Two people froze to death last night. You go to
Grand Central Station and people are stacked like cord wood. People
are stepping over them, and there's (Mayor Edward) Koch, kind of
like Mayor (Elmer) Fudd, saying, `I feel like de pwabwem will go
away uhhhhhh.''
   He is shaken by the city shelters. ``For me, the most horrifying
thing is that there are children. You can't not be moved when you
see a child in these shelters, when they're living in these big,
open dorms,'' he said.
   Children play an important role in Williams' thinking. He traces
his involvement in causes to the birth of his son, Zachary, nearly
six years ago. Fatherhood, he says, ``connects you immediately with
everything.''
   ``I want the world to be at least slightly better for him, to
make it a little bit better so that he will not have to live
underground with a two-headed dog,'' Williams said.
   He uses comedy, he said, ``to lash out, to cut through things _
to cut through the illusion of things, that everything is all
right.''
   This is not always well received. Some audiences balk at
political humor, and ``they'll look like a deer in the headlights of
a Peterbilt (a tractor-trailer).''
   Williams says there are few things that do not lend themselves to
comedy.
   ``Part of being a comic is that you're forced to laugh at
everything,'' he says. ``It makes it difficult to live with one. ...
There is dark humor, too. And everybody has that dark humor, even
about the darkest and bleakest things.''
   He tries to avoid cruelty _ a line he admits to having crossed
more than once. He describes a ``bad comic-good comic'' battle
within.
   ``That's cruel, that's unnecessarily cruel,'' the good comic says.
   ``Yeah, but it's funny. Yeah, it's cruel, but it's REAL funny,''
says the bad comic.
   ``It's cruel.''
   ``Yeah, but ya gotta laugh. Go with it. Don't be afraid!''
   ``No, no, no.''
   ``Oh, shut up.''
   Then, says Robin Williams, the middle mind says: ``Yeah, it's
funny.''

   When Jerri Kiesler used to get upset, lonely, or
bored, she'd pull out her dozen credit cards and zoom to the
shopping malls in search of some little bauble to raise her spirits.
   ``I liked to go to specialty stores where they would call me by
my name as I walked through the door,'' said the 50-year-old Dayton,
Ohio, grandmother. ``It gave me a feeling of self worth.''
   Her mood changed as the bills arrived, followed by late notices,
dunning letters and curt telephone calls from creditors. In two
years, Mrs. Kiesler amassed $12,000 in credit-card debt, nearly half
her annual income from an accounting job. There was no way she could
pay all the bills.
   She now jokes that at least her trip to bankruptcy court was made
in style, thanks to the dresses and more than 200 pairs of shoes
she'd charged from 1984 to 1986.
   Mrs. Kiesler, who filed for personal bankruptcy three years ago
and has remained ``clean'' since, is one of many American
credit-card holders facing crippling financial problems from the
enormous power of plastic.
   The National Foundation for Consumer Credit says about 2 percent
of the 130 million Americans who buy on credit are mired in
credit-card debt, 4 percent face ``some difficulties'' and 10
percent experience ``some discomfort.''
   Some troubled card-holders might take cash advances from one card
to pay debt from another, the foundation says. Others dip into
savings or borrow from friends and neighbors.
   Credit problems grow more acute this time of year because the
Christmas bills start rolling in. The American Bankers Association
says holiday credit card use rose between 8 percent and 9 percent in
1988 over the previous year.
   Debt counselors and therapists say they've noticed a steady
increase in the number of people with credit problems seeking help,
and requests for assistance have intensified this month.
   Many claim that's partly because banks and credit card companies
have lowered their standards by giving people far more credit than
they can handle.
   Luther Gatling, who runs the non-profit Budget &amp; Credit
Counseling Services Inc. in New York, said that while calls for help
from debt-swamped clients might be more noticeable after the
holidays, ``this business doesn't really have an ebb or flow.''
   ``It used to be that we got real busy the end of January. But
because of the proliferation of credit you don't see it as
acutely,'' he said. ``Christmas does heap on credit (and) ... this
may push some people over the edge.''
   To help credit-card addicts, the Maryland-based National
Foundation for Consumer Credit, an umbrella group for services like
Gatling's, has nearly doubled its nationwide offices to around 400
in the last two years, said foundation president Donald L. Badders.
   He said the number of individuals and families receiving budget
counseling from them soared to 211,000 for the year ended Oct. 1
from 176,700 in 1987 and 118,000 five years ago.
   ``As baby boomers came of age in the past 10 years ... the
consuming public has grown,'' Badders said. ``The complexity of
consumer economics has grown.''
   So has the spendthrift yuppie mentality, to some degree.
   ``We've gotten to be a much more materialistic society. The cost
of looking successful is going up and up,'' said Evan Steffans, a
therapist at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, who co-founded a
Shopper Stoppers counseling program with Mrs. Kiesler three years
ago.
   Badders said the percentage of debt-dogged consumers has remained
fairly constant but the size of their debt is ``a lot deeper than it
was 10 years ago.''
   For example, the average person counseled at the foundation
offices in 1980 had around $9,000 in accummulated debt, compared
with $15,000 in 1987 and $17,000 last year. Badders said credit card
debt is the fastest growing component of overall consumer debt.
   ``This tells us that the percentage of those getting into trouble
have taken advantage of more credit opportunities,'' he said. ``What
I've seen happen is more aggressive marketing on the part of credit
card companies.''
   That marketing, some credit counselors contend, can be
irresponsible. The counselors complain that banks, in particular,
don't adequately supervise different subsidiaries that peddle cards.
   Mrs. Kiesler and many others who have faced even worse credit
problems claim they sometimes have received card applications from
the same banks harassing them to pay delinquent bills.
   ``It became a challenge to get credit cards. I still get
applications,'' said Mrs. Kiesler, now unemployed.
   Joseph L. Boutin, an executive vice president for Howard Bank in
Burlington, Vt. and an ABA executive vice president, said those
cases are rare. He said most banks thoroughly check credit
backgrounds.
   ``I'm sure you're going to be able to find some banks that have
lowered their standards for whatever reasons,'' Boutin said. ``Most
banks recognize when they make a loan they have to be paid back
because we have deposit funds at risk.''
   Still, more people who are normally considered a greater credit
risk _ young adults, teens and modest-income earners _ hold a
significant portion of the approximately 850 million credit cards in
circulation.
   Robert Johnson, director of Purdue University's credit research
center, said his most recent data show 21 percent of families with
annual income of less than $10,000 were card holders in 1986, vs. 12
percent in 1983. He said 42 percent of those under age 25 had credit
cards in 1986, vs. 20 percent in 1983. Many bankers and merchants
agree that solicitations for new credit card customers have
increased, but they attribute it to wider acceptance of credit cards
and growing competition for customers.
   This rivalry has pressured issuers to reduce annual fees or lower
interest rates, at a time when interest rates have been rising.
   Further squeezing profits are tax-law changes reducing the
deductibility of credit-card interest. The ABA says about a third of
all card users used to pay their entire bills at the end of the
month, but in the last year that rose to 40 percent. Many issuers
had derived much of their earnings from interest payments on
balances left outstanding.

   Skinheads have grabbed headlines recently for
their white-power and Nazi leanings. But in fact not all skinheads
share those views and they often battle among themselves. The
skinhead culture is intense, complex and tribal, often built more on
friendship and unity than on ideology. Here is a look at the
phemonenon, particularly what happened among a group of skinheads in
Milwaukee.

<TEXT>
   In the early days the whole crew was cool. Hippy
Pat and Big Brian lived at the house. Little Bryan, John and his
brother Tiny were around. So were Jeff the black skinhead, Mike the
Jew and a whole lot of other guys.
   Nobody gave you bad slack; there wasn't much politics and there
was plenty of beer. Sure, you might go out on manhunts or
fag-bashing, but you weren't after anyone in particular. Mostly it
was a place to hang out, a place to be with your skinhead brothers,
a place you felt you belonged.
   They called the house at 700 Wright the 700 Club. As a joke, they
called themselves SHAM, Skinheads Around Milwaukee.
   Then, things got weird, and then it got scary.
   Today SHAM is the Skinhead Army of Milwaukee. Depleted by
defections and arrests, its numbers are down to a hardcore few who
praise Hitler, preach white power and recruit for the cause.
   They are opposed by the Brew City Skins, anti-racist skinheads
who include old SHAM members. There have been fights between the two
groups of former friends and the violence is likely to continue.
   ``It's real sad what happened,'' said John Lyman, a thoughtful
21-year-old skinhead who has tried to maintain a neutrality between
the warring factions. ``We were all brothers, that was important to
us. Then it went every which way and now everybody totally hates
each other.''
   The story of SHAM is a mirror to what is happening around the
country. Disaffected teen-agers, attracted to the skinhead culture
by its music, its sense of belonging and its urban warrior image,
are waging tribal wars on the hard streets of the nation's cities.
   Some become avowed racists and fascists who sport swastika
tattoos. Sometimes they set upon the targets of their rage.
   Others choose a militantly anti-racist stance, battling not only
the racists but also those who try to remain apolitical.
   ``There is definitely a war going on within a subculture of
society and 99 percent of us aren't aware that it's happening except
for those moments when it spills out and a Jew or a black is
assaulted,'' said Chip Berlet of Political Research Associates, a
Cambridge, Mass., think-tank that studies right wing movements.
   Most public attention has focused on the talk show and crime news
sensationalism of racist skinheads, whose numbers are thought to be
around 3,500.
   Assaults on minorities and synagogue vandalism by these skinheads
have made headlines in big cities like Chicago and Dallas and
smaller communities like Grand Rapids, Reno and Paramus, N.J. Three
skinheads have been charged with beating an Ethiopian immigrant to
death with baseball bats in Portland, Ore. Skinheads have thrown
racial slurs and chairs during national talk show appearances.
   ``I want a white world,'' said Scott, a 21-year-old skinhead in
Chicago. ``I don't want my kids to go to school with niggers and
Jews. I'll die for my race. I'll die for my skinhead brothers.''
   There has been less news media coverage of anti-racist skinheads
who have been in bloody brawls with their rivals in places like
Chicago and Minneapolis. No one has counted their numbers, but in
many cities they are equal if not stronger in number than the racist
skinheads.
   Last weekend skinheads from eight Midwestern cities held a summit
in Minneapolis to form a ``syndicate'' to organize and fight the
racist skins.
   ``This is a war,'' said Dave, a member of the Minneapolis
Baldies. ``We're not going to stop till we've wiped out the scum.''
   Both factions pay homage to the British sociological stew of the
1960s and early '70s that produced the skinhead phenomenon from the
ranks of working class youths. They shaved their heads and adopted a
style of dress from the factories that included high-laced,
steel-tipped Doc Marten work boots, suspenders, called braces on
both sides of the Atlantic, and Fred Perry knit shirts.
   At some point the movement shifted. Many skinheads, victims of
Britain's high unemployment, began to blame and attack Pakistanis
and other immigrants. Skinheads were recruited by the National
Front, Britain's ultra right wing political movement. Ska, a
racially mixed music once favored by skinheads was replaced by the
hardcore rock of Skrewdriver, a band whose music is a call to arms
for white supremacists.
   One song complains:
   ``They come here to this country from the jungles and the trees,
   ``Traitors in the Parliament gave them a better deal ...
   ``Before the night falls, heed the white call.''
   Basic skinhead philosophy rejects drugs and encourages a pride in
yourself and your country. Skinheads also stress a family unity
among themselves, an enticement to many alienated youths whose real
families have been fractured.
   ``A lot of them are damaged goods,'' said Larry Harding, a
Portland probation officer. ``They come from broken homes, they
don't fit in in school and they are sometimes attacked by ethnic
gangs. Being a skinhead offers them a chance to be part of
something.''
   While some American skinheads like Scott were first attracted by
the white power message, many others, like those at Milwaukee's 700
club, join the scene for its style and unity.
   ``It was more out of a strong sense of friendship, a sense of
security,'' said Tom Dusick, another ``neutral'' skin who was at the
700 Club when it began in late 1987. ``When you went down there, you
were important and no one was going to mess with you skinheads.''
   The scene in the early days of SHAM was open and relaxed. Jeff
Merchant, a black skinhead from Chicago was an accepted member of
the crew.
   But the crew members weren't angels. They would get beery and go
out on ``manhunts,'' roaming nearby Downer Avenue in search of
trouble.
   ``It's not like we really were looking for it, but 10 bald guys
walking down the street, somebody's got to say something,'' said
Merchant, now a leader of the Brew City Skins.
   But even in the early days there was a latent racism. The crew at
the 700 Club would joke about Jews and blacks. Even today some of
Lyman's friends talk about ``the niggers who do all the crime,'' and
the Jews ``who own all the corporations.''

   ``A lot of us are from places where there are no black people or
Jewish people, so a lot of the guys just had these stereotype ideas
and it just took something to bring them out,'' said Lyman.
   Most agree things began to change with the appearance of Pat
O'Malley, an intense, gravel-voiced 18-year-old from Madison with a
spiderweb tattoo on his shaved skull and a swastika ``tatt'' on his
finger.
   O'Malley got a post office box and began corresponding with
racist skinhead groups in Chicago and Detroit and with White Aryan
Resistance, a Fallbrook, Calif., group run by Tom Metzger, host of
the white power ``Race and Reason'' cable television show.
   The material sent to SHAM was filled with jarring words and
images. ``Nigger'' and ``kike'' appeared often along with talk about
revolution and race warfare. Much of it was in the form of
``fanzines,'' newsletters published by racist skinhead groups in
America and Europe.
   ``The skinhead phenomena has its own motor and own leadership and
then you have Metzger who is trying to inject ideology, discipline
and a level of expertise,'' said Leonard Zeskind, research director
for the anti-racist Center for Democratic Renewal.
   Metzger says he is doing nothing more than responding to the
anger and frustration of young whites.
   ``They see they are slipping through the cracks economically and
they don't feel they have much of a future,'' he said. ``I give them
guidence on the law to stay out of trouble and I give them our
ideology. But I don't try to organize them. They have their own
subculture and tampering with it would destroy it.''
   Whatever the reason, the scene at the 700 Club slowly changed.
   Someone drew a cross-hairs on the television set and labeled it
the ``niggerscope.'' When a black appeared on the screen there would
be cheers of ``we got another one.''
   Merchant retaliated by changing the label to ``Naziscope,'' and
altering the ``white power'' scrawls on the wall to ``white coward.''
   Nobody threatend Merchant _ after all, he was a brother skinhead
_ but after awhile he stopped coming around.
   ``They started handing out hate literature and stuff and people
told me, `Hey, just don't go over there,' so I didn't,'' he said.
   The black college student wasn't alone. Bryan Lauer, Little
Bryan, dropped out too, turning his back on a childhood friend who
had become more and more racist.
   ``I can't talk to him anymore,'' said Lauer.
   But SHAM continued to grow. Word went out on the post office box
grapevine that Milwaukee had a cool scene. Racist skins from
Detroit, Chicago and Texas showed up and moved in.
   Now the scene got scary.
   ``I remember this one guy who had been in Virginia and Detroit
and Cleveland saying how he was going to die to see this country all
white,'' said Dusick. ``They were talking about how they were going
to exterminate everybody.''
   He concluded, ``These guys are wacky,'' and he didn't go back.
   SHAM moved from the wrecked house on Wright Street to another
address. Members attended Klan and Nazi rallies in other cities and
attracted local media coverage by goose-stepping and then brawling
at a neighborhood fair.
   A newspaper printed a map of the skinhead house and carloads of
teen-agers began to drive by, tossing bottles and shouting threats.
   Last July 14, Hollin Lange, a member of the Dallas Hammerskins,
was hit by birdshot while standing outside the house. Six days later
he and O'Malley fired into a car of teens, claiming they had seen a
gun.
   The shooting ended SHAM. As in other cities, like Chicago and Los
Angeles, the violence and subsequent arrests broke up the group,
sending some members fleeing to Oregon, Texas and Oklahoma.
   These days the five or so remaining members of SHAM keep a low
profile at their new house. The street buzz is they are recruiting
younger kids in nearby towns like Racine and Kenosha. They refuse to
talk to the press as does O'Malley, who is scheduled to go on trial
this week.
   Lauer and the Brew City Skins are also recruiting, passing out
literature to explain the differences between them and SHAM.
   ``We want people to know we're different,'' said Lauer.
   ``Neutrals'' like Lyman and Dusick are facing growing pressure to
choose between the two sides.
   ``It's getting real hard to stay out of it,'' said Lyman.
   If forced to choose, Lyman says he will have to back his friends
in SHAM. He doesn't believe in their hatred, but he goes back with
them to the days when it was just a bunch of people with shaved
heads and a kinship.
   ``It's a real deep friendship thing. It made me feel like I was
somebody for once,'' he said. ``Even if they are the worst to
everybody, they were still our brothers.''

   Budget &amp; Credit Counseling Services Inc., just
north of the Wall Street financial district, seems almost cheery
with smiling receptionists, bright lights and pretty pastel-colored
cubicles.
   But once inside, debt-plagued clients are asked to spill their
financial guts, detailing everything from mortgage payments to the
monthly cost of cleaning their underwear.
   A recent visit showed it's seldom pleasant.
   Mary, a 58-year-old Brooklyn woman, sat tearful as counselor Ann
Quigley tried to concoct a repayment plan for the $12,056 in credit
card debts she racked up over two years. Mary said she made the
charges, mostly for cash advances, to help pay her 19-year-old
grandson's college costs.
   ``I really don't know how I spend it because I don't make it,''
said the woman, who earned $17,352 last year in her social services
job, 10 percent of which was donated to her church.
   ``Have they (creditors) been calling you a lot?'' asked Ms.
Quigley.
   ``No, just sending letters mostly,'' Mary replied. ``I knew after
the start of the year that they would start bugging me, though.''
   ``Tell me, how much is your monthly rent? Transportation costs?
Laundry or dry-cleaning bill? ...,'' Ms. Quigley asked.
   She discovered that all of Mary's $926 monthly pay is spent on
necessities. That left nothing for savings _ not to mention the $455
a month Ms. Quigley had proposed as a payback to creditors under a
three-year plan.
   ``Would you consider getting a part-time job?'' she asked.
   Meanwhile, several feet away, Mark, a 30-year-old word processor
operator, sat with a phone in his ear. He had discarded his $10,000
worth of credit-card bills two years ago, and was trying to
re-establish contact with creditors.
   ``Who invented these credit cards anyway?'' he huffed.
   The New York budget counseling office, which sees about 10,000
families and individuals a year, is one of about 400 offices
nationwide affiliated with the non-profit Maryland-based National
Foundation for Consumer Credit. It's also one of the busiest.
   Foundation President Donald L. Badders says the number of people
seeking credit help has risen steadily for reasons ranging from
family economic problems to wider credit card use.
   In the fiscal year ended Oct. 1, the foundation offices counseled
211,000 clients, 78 percent higher than five years ago. Last year,
the foundation said it recovered $242 million to businesses through
the repayment plans it arranged with clients.
   For a $20 fee, sometimes waived for extreme cases, these offices
act as an intermediary between debtors and creditors, arranging for
small monthly repayments.
   There are also for-profit budget counseling offices, but the
foundation says some are fly-by-night operations that charge big
fees and make false promises.
   ``Watch out for credit clinics that purport to be able to repair
your credit rating because it cannot be done,'' said Luther Gatling,
founder and president of the New York budget counseling office.
   Debtors have several options to reform.
   Besides following the foundation's standard three-year plan, they
can take out a debt-consolidation loan. But some experts warn these
loans are disguised home-equity loans, saddling a debtor with the
risk of losing his home if he fails to repay.
   Another alternative is personal bankruptcy. Debtors can either
repay loans after liquidating assets under Chapter 7 of federal
bankruptcy laws or reorganize and stave off creditors under Chapter
13. Either way, their credit rating will remain tarnished for at
least seven years.

   The U.S. trade deficit ballooned to $12.5
billion in November, the biggest imbalance in five months, the
government said in a report many private economists and even the
Reagan administration viewed as a disappointing indication of how
deep the country's trade problems are.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday the trade gap was 22
percent larger than October's $10.3 billion deficit, reflecting a
surge in imports, particularly for business capital goods, and a
slight drop in exports.

   Japan said its surplus of exports over imports
surged in December to a monthly record, despite official assurances
that the Asian economic giant is moving forcefully to open markets

   Although the Finance Ministry said Wednesday the surplus shrank
for all of 1988, figures showed it was widening in the last four
months of the year, capped by the $9.65 billion imbalance recorded
last month.

   Americans used more energy in 1988 than in any
year in history, and oil imports hit a 9-year high, an industry
trade group said.
   The American Petroleum Institute said Wednesday a more
encouraging development last year was an indication the nation is
making new gains in the efficient use of energy.
   The trade organization, representing the bigger U.S. oil
producers and refiners, said U.S. consumption of all types of energy

   U.S. industry operated at its highest rate in

the modest pace of growth should allay fears of increasing inflation.
   Use of industrial capacity at factories, mines and utilities rose
0.1 percentage point to 84.2 percent last month, the Federal Reserve

better business activity for this year, financial executives at many
U.S. corporations foresee the possibility of an economic downturn in
1990.
   For three consecutive quarters, a majority of executives
responding to the National Association of Accountants survey have
predicted a recession will occur next year.
   Asked to project where the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial

   The Federal Reserve Board authorized five of
the nation's largest banks to underwrite corporate debt and said it
would decide in a year whether to allow banks to underwrite stock.
   The unanimous decision Wednesday by the seven-member board
greatly expands the type of underwriting permitted, but still
severely limits the quantity of underwriting.
   The Fed said bank holding companies may only conduct securities
underwriting through a separate subsidiary regulated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. And, the subsidiary may earn no
more than 5 percent of its revenue from underwriting activities.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The energy futures market gathered more steam,
with the price of crude oil reaching a 14-month high and refined
petroleum products rising more than a penny a gallon.
   Analysts attributed Wednesday's rally largely to a bullish trade
report on oil production and to continued optimism that the
13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will abide
by its production-cutting pact that went into effect Jan. 1.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled
at $19.26 a barrel Wednesday, up 31 cents from Tuesday, when it
gained 7 cents.
   Wednesday's close was the highest since Nov. 3, 1987, when the
near-term contract settled on the exchange at $19.49 a barrel. At
that time, there were concerns that the Iran-Iraq war could
seriously disrupt shipments of crude from the Persian Gulf.
   Among refined contracts traded on the exchange Wednesday, the
February contract for home heating oil settled 1.56 cents higher at
54.61 cents a gallon. The contract had fallen 0.11 cent on Tuesday.
   February unleaded gasoline jumped 1.16 cents to settle at 52.26
cents a gallon, after rising 0.19 cent Tuesday.
   ``Traders are more confident in OPEC and they feel that OPEC will
continue to get it together through the summer,'' said Bob Baker, an
energy analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The oil cartel had agreed last fall to slash daily output to 18.5
million barrels in an effort to prop up sagging worldwide oil
prices. OPEC members have shown signs of sticking to that agreement,
and prices have steadily risen since the first of the year.
   Baker said a weekly report from the American Petroleum Institute
showing a sharp decline in U.S. oil supplies also added a positive
tone to the energy market Wednesday.
   API, which represents the major U.S. oil producers and refiners,
said oil imports last year jumped to the highest level since 1979.
It said production fell to 8.1 million barrels a day, a nearly 3
percent drop from 1987.

   Whittle Communications LP plans to launch a daily
televised news show that will include commercials and give schools
thousands of dollars in equipment to show it in the classroom during
the school day.
   In its first venture into television, the Knoxville, Tenn.-based
media company plans to begin testing its daily 12-minute news show _
which includes up to two minutes of ads _ in early March in four to
six schools.
   If the seven-week test proves successful, the program could
launched nationally in the fall of 1990 in up to 10,000 schools with
as many as 7 million students at a cost of more than $100 million in
hardware alone.
   Christopher Whittle, chairman and founder of the company, said
the project represents ``what we hope will be our major contribution
to the media business'' in the 1990s, and possibly Whittle's most
lucrative venture.
   Whittle believes the program has advantages for students,
educators and advertisers. But the plan also has raised questions
about allowing marketers to make sales pitches in the classroom.
   Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television, a
self-styled children's advocate, said it is ``outrageous to let
sales people into the schools connected to education.''
   The schools will get dozens of television monitors, a satellite
dish and a system hooking it all together so that the news show,
dubbed Channel One, can be shown to students daily. The schools can
use the system for their own non-commercial purposes, provided they
run the show or explain why not.
   Whittle said the hardware alone will cost about $50,000 per
school, a price many schools could not afford.
   The show, initially being produced in Los Angeles, will be sent
by satellite to the schools every weekday. It is being produced by
Susan Winston, a former producer of ABC's ``Good Morning America''
show.
   A typical show _ which could have possibly four 30-second
commercials _ would have several hard news stories relevant to
students in the 12-to-17 age group and narrated by young anchor
people, a profile of someone in the news, a segment in a multi-part
series on an issue like the environment and other features,
interlaced with trivia or a quiz.
   Whittle said 60 percent of the ad time has been sold for the test
but refused to identify the buyers. He said if the program goes
national, sponsors will be asked for long-term commitments, possibly
up to five years.
   He said many advertisers are interested in reaching the elusive
teenage audience, which has attracted even wider attention as teens
have started shopping for the family because both parents work
outside the home.
   But the paid pitches have raised some concerns.
   Whittle has identifed only three of the schools selected for the
test. They are Mumford High School in Detroit, Eisenhower Middle
School in Kansas City, Kan., and Central High School in Knoxville,
Tenn.
   Robin Oden, principal at Mumford, conceded he has reservations
about airing commercials in school.
   But he said the advantages of getting the video hardware and a
timely program with educational value outweighed the negatives of
the commercials.
   The school could ``absolutely not'' afford to buy the 103
television monitors and satellite dish it will get for the test
project, Oden said.
   He likes the idea of being able to use the system to address the
entire school by television, show videos of classroom lessons or run
tapes recorded from television, such as a special on Martin Luther
King Jr.
   Nonetheless, Oden said he told Whittle Communications he would
not permit a show, for example, which had advertising that
encouraged students to wear the type of clothing or jewelry to
school that Mumford's dress policy forbids.
   Whittle said his agreement with the schools allows administrators
to review shows before they are aired and to withhold them if they
find something objectionable, provided they report their reasons for
doing so.
   He said he has banned ads for beer or other alcoholic beverages,
cigarettes and contraceptives.
   Whittle Communications has found rewards in creating media aimed
at reaching narrowly-defined audiences. Its revenue amounted to $150
million last year, and Time Inc. paid $185 million for a 50 percent
interest in the concern last October.
   Whittle currently reaches about 10,000 students with sponsored
posters and its GO! (Girls Only!) magazine.
   Last summer, it launched Special Reports magazine, a series of
six magazines available only in doctor's waiting rooms. That project
generated $40 million a year in ad revenue.

<TEXT>
   Steel imports rose in November, pushing the
total for 11 months of 1988 to a level 6.8 percent above 1987,
although foreign steel continued near the limits set by a U.S. quota
plan.
   November imports totaled 1.85 million tons, up from 1.55 million
tons in October and 1.78 million tons in November 1987. For the
first 11 months of the year, imports were 19.47 million tons in
1988, compared with 18.23 million tons in 1987.
   The figures were compiled by the American Iron and Steel
Institute in Washington, D.C., using Commerce Department data, and
were released Wednesday.
   Market penetration by imports was 22.2 percent in November, up
from 18.9 percent in October and 21.5 percent in November 1987. For
the 11 months, foreign steel captured 20.6 percent of the market in
1988 and 21 percent in 1987.
   Import quotas due to expire in September after five years in
force were intended to restrict imported steel to 20.2 percent of
the U.S. market.
   A rival to the U.S. producers' organization, the New York-based
American Institute for Imported Steel in New York, said that after
subtracting semifinished steel ordered by U.S. mills from foreign
producers, market penetration was only 17.7 percent, below the 18.5
percent goal for that category.
   U.S. steelmakers bought an estimated 2.84 million tons of foreign
steel in the first 11 months of 1988, the AIIS said.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady, Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was steady against most major currencies
in European trading this morning, buoyed by speculation the market
was preparing to test central bank resolve at keeping the U.S.
currency from climbing.
   Gold prices were mixed but also steady.
   The dollar withstood several rounds of central bank intervention
Wednesday following the report of a bigger-than-expected U.S. trade
deficit in November, dealers said.
   The market had expected a deficit of about $11 billion, but
instead it widened sharply to $12.5 billion from a revised $10.3
billion in October.
   Traders said today they interpreted the dollar's resilience as a
sign the market was gearing up to test central bank willingness to
intervene to slow the dollar's advance.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7555 to buy one pound, dearer than $1.7550 late Tuesday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.8665 West German marks, down from
1.8705; 1.5885 Swiss francs, down from 1.5890; 6.3735 French francs,
down from 6.3800; 2.1062 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0925; 1,368.75
Italian lire, up from 1,356.75; 1.1920 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1937.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.30 Japanese yen to a closing 129.20
yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 129.15 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $402 a troy ounce, down
from $402.25 late Wednesday. At mid-morning, major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $402.30.
   In Zurich, gold was slightly lower, trading at a bid $402.25,
compared with $402.40 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 81 cents to close at a bid
$403.83.
   Silver bullion fell on the London market to a bid price of $5.92
a troy ounce from $5.94 bid late Wednesday.

   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen
today despite an increase in the U.S. trade deficit, while share
prices eased on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 129.20 yen, up 1.30 yen from Wednesday's
finish of 127.90 yen. It opened at 128.55 yen and ranged between
128.37 yen and 129.35 yen.
   The dollar, which now has gained 3.08 yen in four days, finished
above 129 yen for the first time since its 129.65 yen closing last
Oct. 12.
   The U.S. trade report released Wednesday showed a $12.5 billion
deficit for November, up 22 percent from October.
   But Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of Daiwa Bank in Tokyo said investors
still were buying dollars. He said they looked for continued high
U.S. interest rates because the figure showed that with steady
economic growth, the United States still was able to increase
imports.
   Higher U.S. interest rates tend to make dollar-denominated
investments more attractive to foreigners.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 127.03-point gainer
Wednesday, shed 43.15 points, or 0.14 percent, closing at 31,311.40.
   The index gained in early trading, but then started to fall as
institutional investors moved to the sidelines, while some others
were selling to collect profits, said a dealer with a major
securities firm in Tokyo.
   ``The Nikkei's decline, triggered by the selling of steel issues,
was mainly because of the falling yen,'' said the dealer, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Other dealers said the recent uptrend in oil prices also
discouraged investors.
   In active trading, volume on the first section was estimated at
1.2 billion shares.

<HEAD>More Price Hikes In Yugoslavia, Including Gas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavs, already frustrated by a
sharp fall in living standards, were hit Thursday by a new wave of
price increases on more than 300 goods and services, including
gasoline, diesel fuel and other oil derivatives, averaging 28.58
percent.
   A liter (0.26 gallons) of high-octane gasoline went up by 31
percent, and now costs 2,260 dinars (41 cents). The liter price of
regular gasoline jumped from 1,610 dinars (29 cents) to 2,120 dinars
(39 cents) and diesel fuel rose from 1,420 dinars (26 cents) to
1,850 dinars (34 cents).
   Average Yugoslav monthly wages amounts to the equivalent of about
$80.
   The national petroleum company attributed the increase to a 36.62
percent depreciation of the dinar against the U.S. dollar since the
last fuel price hike on Nov. 12, which makes foreign oil purchases
more expensive in the local currency.
   Yugoslavs were hit as of the start of this year by an
unprecedented wave of price hikes for about 1,000 goods and services
ranging from 30 to 70 percent. The increases applied to food,
drinks, clothing, cosmetics and nearly all services.
   The hikes further boosted the country's rampant inflation which
recorded 251 percent for 1988. Living standards have dropped by half
since 1980 and have fallen to the level of mid-1960s, according to
official statistics.
   The statistics also say that nearly 70 percent of Yugoslav
workers live in a state of ``existential minimum.''
   A record of nearly 1,400 strikes, seriously threatening the
country's communist system, were officially registered last year,
amid public calls for the introduction of a multi-party system as a
solution to the protracted Yugoslav crisis.
   Marjan Orozen, president of the country's state-run trade union,
was quoted Thursday as saying that ``social tensions and discontent
of the people could at any moment cause an explosion'' of labor
unrest.

<TEXT>
   West Germany's central bank said
Thursday that it was raising two key interest rates a half
percentage point each to battle inflation and counter the Deutsche
mark's recent slide against other major currencies.
   The Bundesbank said that effective Friday it was boosting its
discount rate to 4 percent and the Lombard rate to 6 percent.
   The discount rate is the interest the central bank charges on
loans to member banks, while the Lombard rate is the rate charged
for short-term loans when securities are used as collateral.
   In a statement, the Bundesbank said its policy-setting council
decided on the increases to dampen money supply growth, a sign of
growing inflation, and to counter the depreciation of the mark
against other major currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar.
   The world financial markets had expected West Germany to raise
its interest following the sharp rise in the dollar in recent days.
   Still, shortly after the rate increases were announced the dollar
continued to rise in nervous European trading, hitting a nearly
four-month high in Frankfurt, dealers said.

<HEAD>Motorola Files Lawsuit Against Hitachi, Cites Patent Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. has filed a lawsuit charging that
Hitachi Ltd. has infringed on several of the U.S. company's patents
and is engaging in unfair competition in the sale of microprocessors.
   In the lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, Motorola
accuses Tokyo-based Hitachi of engaging in unfair competition with
its new H-8 microprocessor.
   Also named in the lawsuit are Hitachi America Ltd. of Itasca,
Ill., and Nissei Sangyo America Ltd. of Rolling Meadows, Ill., both
distributors of Hitachi products.
   ``Hitachi America is greatly surprised at this action by
Motorola,'' spokesman Sam Nishikawa said. ``Until Hitachi America
has had an opportunity to review the complaint, we are unable to
comment on this matter.''
   A hearing was scheduled for today on Motorola's request for an
injunction halting sales of the microprocessor. The lawsuit also
asks for monetary damages to be determined by the court.
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., says the unfair competition
began shortly after Motorola granted a patent license to Hitachi for
certain Motorola microprocessors in May 1986.
   The company says the Hitachi H-8 microprocessor series infringes
on at least four Motorola patents.
   The microprocessor is a digital electronic device that performs
the control and arithmetic functions of a computer.
   Motorola says its patent license and related technology
agreements with Hitachi specifically limit the use of Motorola's
confidential and proprietary information on the MC6800-68000
families of microprocessors.
   Despite the limits, Hitachi introduced its Zero Turn-Around Time
microprocessors in 1986, using Motorola technology that was excluded
from agreements between the companies, Motorola said.
   Motorola spokesman Tim Kellogg said his company had been in
negotiations with Hitachi since October in an effort to stop sales
of the H-8 microprocessor.
   ``We have had patent licenses with Hitachi for more than 10
years,'' Kellogg said. ``This is the first time we have had to sue
them.''
   In 1983 Hitachi, one of Japan's largest makers of computers,
electronic circuits and consumer electronic products, agreed to pay
International Business Machines Corp. between $2 million and $4
million a month for eight years.
   Hitachi agreed to the payments to settle an IBM lawsuit that
charged Hitachi with using computer software that too closely
resembled software copyrighted by IBM. Hitachi did not admit to any
guilt in the agreement.
   Also in 1983, Hitachi pleaded guilty to federal charges of
attempting to obtain and transport stolen IBM computer materials to
Japan. It paid the maximum fine of $10,000.
   The Motorola lawsuit claims that Hitachi used Motorola's
exclusive proprietary technology to coerce Motorola into extending
additional patent license rights to Hitachi.

<HEAD>Church's Fried Chicken Announces Company's Auction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church's Fried Chicken, fighting a $290
million hostile takeover by its chief rival, says it is for sale,
but still calls inadequate the buyout offer made by Popeyes Famous
Fried Chicken and Biscuits.
   Church's, which over the past three months has sold off
restaurants and taken Popeyes to court in an attempt to halt the
hostile takeover bid, announced Wednesday that it would be in the
company's best interest to be auctioned off.
   In a prepared statement, the company's board of directors said it
could end the bidding for the company's sale within 30 days.
   The statement also said that Church's financial advisers still
believed Popeyes offer of $8 per share was inadequate, but that it
was willing to provide Popeyes the information that had been
provided to other interested third parties.
   ``We believe the offer by Copeland is inadequate and to have them
(shareholders) move on that is not in their best interest,'' said
Church's attorney Diane Kerr. ``We think this decision is a move
made out of responsibility by the directors for the shareholders.''
   Popeyes is owned by Al Copeland, who earlier this month was given
permission to continue his attempted takeover of Church's, after
federal court proceedings stalled his efforts.
   San Antonio-based Church's, the country's No. 2 chicken
restaurant chain with 1,478 units, has been fighting since last
November a hostile takeover bid by New Orleans-based Popeyes, the
country's No. 3 chicken chain with 703 restaurants.
   Church's claims that two of its former executives now working for
Popeyes used illegally obtained information in the buyout offer and
that the buyout would violate U.S. antitrust laws.
   On Nov. 4, Church's adopted anti-takeover bylaws to make a
takeover less attractive, and later challenged Popeyes in court.
   Church's announcement Wednesday came a day before a San Antonio
federal judge was to preside over a hearing to determine the
legality of anti-takeover bylaws.
   Church's spokeswoman Faye Kilgore said that Ernie Renaud,
Church's president and chief executive officer, would not be
available for comment Wednesday.
   Popeyes officials did not return telephone calls to The
Associated Press.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz of New Orleans in late
November prohibited Popeyes from buying Church's stock until it
revealed more information about its buyout offer.
   Church's, meanwhile, sued by shareholders worried that their
earnings would be jeopardized if the company was not sold, announced
in mid-December that it would immediately close 120 of its
restaurants around the country.
   In January, a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel said that
Popeyes could continue with its takeover bid.
   Under the tentative plan given to Schwartz in December, Popeyes
planned to close 250 of Church's restaurants, rename 303 others as
Popeyes, sell 440 others for $160 million and would keep 83
restaurants with the Church's name.

   Share prices were higher in active trading at
midday Thursday, with players encouraged by the market's ability to
easily surpass its previous post-crash highs.
   Shares were also boosted by bullishly interpreted British
unemployment and industrial production figures.
   But shares fell back from their morning peaks when a stock
shortage appeared to ease.
   By about 12:30 p.m., the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was up 17.3 points, or 0.9 percent, at 1,909.4 points, off
from its early morning best level of 1,913.5 points up. The index
slumped to its minimum of 1,904.5 at midmorning.
   Volume was a healthy 494.1 million shares by midday, compared
with 301.6 million shares at the same time Wednesday.
   ``There's lots of business for everybody,'' said one market
maker, who described trading as ``electric.''
   Britain's underlying average earnings dipped in November, easing
worries over inflationary pressures on the economy, dealers said.
Unemployment and manufacturing both dropped.
   ``The market's reaction was one of pleasure to the figures,'' a
trader said.

<HEAD>Report of Big Trade Deficit Doesn't Faze Financial Markets</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with reports on consumer price index and housing starts.
Tightens thruout. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation on the consumer side reached 4.4 percent during 1988,
the same as a year earlier, as hefty, drought-induced increases for
groceries offset stable energy prices, the government reported today.
   The gain, as measured in the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index, matched the 1987 increase, which was the highest since 1981
but was four times the 1.1 percent rate in 1986, a 25-year low.
   A 0.3 percent rise in the index in December, which followed a 0.3
percent November increase, helped inflation finish the year at a
moderate pace.
   The summer drought, which shriveled crops and seared pastures,
pushed food prices for the year up 5.2 percent, the steepest rise
since 1980. However, energy for the year rose only a slight 0.5
percent following an 8.2 percent jump in 1987.
   In another economic report today, the Commerce Department said
housing construction fell 2.2 percent in December from the previous
month. That helped drag down construction for the entire year to
1.49 million units, the poorest showing for the housing industry
since the recession year of 1982 when 1.06 million units were built.
   December's seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.52 million units
was down from 1.56 million units a month earlier. It was the
steepest monthly drop since a 12.1 percent decline last May.
   On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that November's
trade imbalance reached $12.5 billion, the biggest in five months
and 22 percent larger than October's $10.3 billion deficit.
   But even with the November deterioration, the trade deficit for
the first 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of $137.3
billion, almost 20 percent below the all-time imbalance of $170.3
billion set in 1987.
   Many private economists viewed the latest report as an indication
of the severity of the country's trade problems.
   Undaunted by the disappointing trade figures, though, financial
markets posted strong performances Wednesday. Some analysts said
market operators took comfort from renewed hopes that inflationary
pressures may be abating.
   The stock market rose in heavy trading, with the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials up 24.11 points at 2,238.75, surpassing
its post-crash peak of 2,226.07 it reached last Friday.
   Some of the power driving equities higher came from the
surprising resilience of the dollar. Frequently in the past, a poor
trade report induced currency dealers to dump dollars but on
Wednesday heavy buying pushed the dollar higher against most leading
currencies.
   Taking a cue from the currency markets, bond prices rose with the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gaining nearly $7 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   In commodity markets, crude oil futures continued their recent
rally and pierced the important psychological level of $19 a barrel.
   In other economic reports Wednesday:
   _The Federal Reserve Board said production at the nation's
factories, mines and utilities climbed 0.3 percent in December
following a revised increase of 0.4 percent in November.
   _The Fed said the operating rate at factories, mines and
utilities rose in December to the highest rate since November 1979.
Industrial capacity rose 0.1 percentage points to 84.2 percent last
month, the highest rate since 84.3 percent in November 1979. The
operating rate for November 1988 was a revised 84.1 percent.
   But even with the November deterioration, the trade deficit for
the first 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of $137.3
billion, almost 20 percent below the all-time imbalance of $170.3
billion set in 1987.

   Anti-smoking activists have presented the
government with an action plan for a smoke-free Norway by the year
2000.
   The plan, handed to Social Minister Tove Strand Gerhardsen this
week, was a follow-up to a law adopted last year forbidding smoking
in areas like theater lobbies, bus or train terminals, and in
offices occupied by more than one person.
   The government itself has endorsed the goal of making Norway

recent years has increased by 500 tons per year. Norway has
prohibited tobacco advertising since 1973.
   Seven organizations, including the Norwegian Association of
Sports Federations, the National Public Health Assn. and the
Norwegian Cancer Society, formulated a tough program urging the
government to adopt it in stages over the next six years.
   Among the measures were a smoke-free environment in schools and
kindergartens, an increase in taxes on tobacco products and
outlawing their sale to youths under 18.
   The action plan demanded a smoking ban in prisons and other
public institutions. It called for setting aside for non-smokers at
least one-third of all hotel rooms and tables at hotel restaurants
by 1992, and further reducing that by at least half by 1995.
   All discoteques, clubs, theater, restaurant and concert halls
should be off-limits to smokers, the plan said.
   Chewing tobacco and snuff, which some Scandinavians stick to
their upper gum, would be declared health hazards.
   The plan called for a special working group including government
representatives to monitor implementation of the action plan.

   Borman's Inc. says it will contest a lawsuit by
shareholders who say they sold their stock at artificially low
prices at a time company officials were holding secret acquisition
talks with A&amp;P.
   Mortimer Flohr and Pauline Flohr, who own about 100 shares of
Borman's stock, seek punitive damages of $20 million in a suit filed
Jan. 11 in U.S. District Court in New York.
   The Flohrs also ask class-action status on behalf of all others
who sold Borman's stock between Nov. 28 and Dec. 12.
   Officials at Borman's, operator of 79 Farmer Jack supermarkets in
the Detroit area, said in a news release that the company was served
with the complaint Wednesday and would defend itself.
   The lawsuit claims that Borman's stock began trading in heavy
volumes in late November, and that on Nov. 28 a spokesman said the
company had no explanation.
   On Dec. 12, Borman's announced that it was negotiating with A&amp;P.
Its stock rose the next day to nearly $25 a share from $13. On Dec.
23, Borman's announced an agreement to sell the Farmer Jack stores
to A&amp;P for $76 million.
   Borman's officials did not return phone calls Wednesday and early
today about the suit. Lester Levy, the Flohrs attorney in New York,
declined to elaborate on the suit.

   The stock market showed some spotty gains today,
bidding to extend its early-1989 rally despite some resistance from
sellers.
   At 10 a.m. on Wall Street the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
stood at 2,238.75, unchanged from Wednesday's close.
   But gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 534 up, 439
down and 537 unchanged. Other market indicators advanced slightly.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.55 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose
0.3 percent in December, bringing the increase in the index for all
of 1988 to 4.4 percent.
   The latest monthly figure was a bit lower than most advance
estimates by financial economists, and thus helped contribute to a
generally upbeat mood in the market.
   However, brokers say the market's recent strength has not seemed
to derive from current economic news, but rather from a gradual
easing of the fears that have persisted ever since the crash in
October 1987.
   As stock prices have risen lately, they have attracted fresh
buying from investing institutions and other market participants who
began to worry that their caution might cause them to miss a
significant rally.
   Compaq Computer climbed 2 to 62} in active trading. The company
said its sales and earnings for the fourth quarter were likely to
exceed analysts' estimates.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.06 to 161.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .35 at 308.57.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 24.11 to
2,238.75, surpassing the recovery peak of 2,226.07 it reached last
Friday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 1,038 up, 463 down and 459 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 187.54 million shares, against 143.93
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Stock Sale in Lyondell Subsidiary is 3rd Biggest Initial Offering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. put half its Lyondell
Petrochemical Co. subsidiary up for sale to the public in an initial
stock offering that, at $1.2 billion, is the third biggest by an
American company.
   The sale of 40 million shares of Lyondell stock at a price of $30
per share is being underwritten by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon
Brothers Inc.
   Proceeds from sale of stock in the Houston chemical manufacturer
will go to Arco, with potential uses including purchase of
oil-producing property and repurchase of Arco stock, said
spokeswoman Jacqueline Wilson.
   Lyondell, which produces fuel and lubricants as well as oil-based
chemicals, has been approved for listing on the New York Stock
Exchange, Arco said. Its symbol on stock lists will be LYO.
   The stock sale ranks as the third largest initial public offering
by a U.S. company, though two other companies have gone public at
the same $1.2 billion price, according to IDD Information Services
Inc., which compiles such data.
   Consolidated Rail Corp. went public with a $1.65 billion stock
sale in 1987 and Henley Group Inc. had an initial public offering of
$1.3 billion in 1986. Duff &amp; Phelps Selected Utilities and Coca-Cola
Enterprises Inc. both went public at $1.2 billion.
   Arco owned all of Lyondell's 80 million shares previous to the
sale. It has given the underwriters the option of buying 6 million
shares to cover over-allotments. That could dilute Arco's ownership
to 42.5 percent, and if that happened, the Los Angeles-based oil
company said it would repurchase shares on the open market to keep
its holdings just under 50 percent.
   Here, according to IDD, are the biggest initial public offerings
by U.S. companies:
   Consolidated Rail Corp., $1.65 billion, March 26, 1987
   Henley Group Inc., $1.3 billion, May 20, 1986
   Lyondell Petrochemical Co., $1.2 billion, Jan. 18, 1989
   Duff &amp; Phelps Selected Utilities, $1.2 billion, Jan. 21, 1987
   Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., $1.2 billion, Nov. 21, 1986
   MFS Multimarket Income Trust, $1.1 billion, March 5, 1987
   Fireman's Fund Corp., $824 million, Oct. 23, 1986

<TEXT>
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. said today it has raised its
tender offer for Polaroid Corp. to $45 per share, including
approximately 10 million shares issued to Polaroid's employee stock
ownership plan, valuing the new deal at $3.2 billion.
   Stanley P. Gold, Shamrock's president and chief executive
officer, also said that Shamrock would wage a proxy battle for
control of Polaroid's board at the annual meeting May 9.
   Shamrock, a Burbank, Calif.-based television and radio concern
wholly owned by the Roy E. Disney family, previously had offered $42
a share, not including the ESOP shares, or $2.6 billion.
   There was no immediate comment from Polaroid, the instant camera
company based in Cambridge.
   Polaroid management has rejected previous Shamrock offers, and
more than 5,000 of the company's 8,300 employees signed a petition
last month saying they had ``no comfort or confidence'' that a
takeover would benefit the company.
   He added that Shamrock's slate of nominees would be committed to
the sale of Polaroid to Shamrock, ``unless a bonafide third party
offer is made for all the then outstanding shares at a higher
price.''
   Shamrock said its tender offer expires March 15 and is contingent
on obtaining at least 90 percent of Polaroid's 71.6 million
outstanding stock, including the shares in the employee stock
ownership plan.
   The takeover may hinge on a court battle over the legality of the
ESOP, which Shamrock claims was enacted to forestall a takeover. The
Delaware Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments in March on
Shamrock's appeal of a Chancery Court ruling that upheld the ESOP.
   Shamrock said that if it wins the appeal, it will raise its offer
to $47 dollars a share.

   Defense electronics contractor Fairchild
Industries Inc. has rejected an unsolicited $264 million takeover
offer by a Washington, D.C.-based investment partnership.
   Fairchild notified the Carlyle Group Wednesday it would become a
private company as a means of heading off the hostile takeover
attempt.
   A statement issued by the company read in part: ``The proposed
conditional cash purchase of $15.50 per share of common stock was
financially inadequate and not in the best interests of Fairchild
and all its stockholders.''
   The company's stock closed up 12{ cents per share Wednesday to
$16.25 following news of the rejection.
   The Carlyle Group said it would review its options, according to
Stephen Norris, one of the company's managing directors.
   ``I suspect shareholders, if given the option, would tend to
support a purchase ... over a vague plan to improve performance over
some extended period of time. Our interest in owning the company
hasn't diminshed,'' Norris said.
   The investment partnership purchased about 10 percent of
Fairchild stock last fall and offered to take the company private.
But Fairchild said it will go private in a $264 million transaction.
   Carlyle has made takover offers for an increasing number of
companies in recent years and purchased Oakite Products Inc., a New
Jersey chemical company last year.

<TEXT>
   The Murray Chris-Craft Inc. boatworks will
close Jan. 27, ending a 50-year presence here and Michigan's legacy
as home to the world's oldest manufacturer of pleasure boats,
company officials confirmed today.
   Chris-Craft's debt-ridden parent company, Murray Industries Inc.
of Bradenton, Fla., made the announcement Wednesday to the 70
workers still employed at the Holland Township plant, which employed
about 600 workers as recently as 1983.
   The workers will lose their jobs because a potential buyer of the
Chris-Craft line doesn't want the 50-year-old local classic cruiser
plant and one in Bellingham, Wash., company and union official said.
   The company filed for reorganization under the federal bankruptcy
code Dec. 9. A week ago, Murray tentatively accepted a $15 million
offer from Genmar Industries of Minneapolis, one of the nation's
largest recreational boat manufacturers. Genmar does not want the
Holland plant.
   Chris-Craft has its roots in Algonac, Mich., where it was founded
in 1874. The recreational boats have been built in at least one
Michigan plant since. When Chris-Craft opened its Holland plant in
1939 in Allegan County, it was touted as the largest boat-buiding
oepration in the world.
   Holland Township Superintendent Willis Driesenga said the closing
``will be a shock to the whole community. I think everybody at one
time worked there or knew someone who worked there.''

<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices opened sharply higher today
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for continued dry
weather in the Great Plains and indications of renewed foreign
buying interest.
   Corn and soybean futures were nearly unchanged in early trading.
   A 6-to-10-day forecast issued Wednesday by the National Weather
Service predicted at least another week of below-normal
precipitation from Texas to Nebraska, the heart of the nation's
winter wheat area.
   The forecast fanned bullish interest in the wheat market, where
memories of last year's drought are still fresh, analysts said.
   ``We're getting buying now on a weather basis,'' said Walter
Spilka, a grain-market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
in New York. ``The market looks like it's just going to work higher
now until it rains.''
   The winter wheat crop is planted in the fall and harvested in the
spring.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with March
at $4.43 a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to } cent higher with March
at $2.70\ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1} cents higher with March

   Live cattle were unchanged to .38 cent higher with February at
73.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .33 cent
higher with January at 84.70 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged

<TEXT>
   Richard Darman, nominated to be George Bush's
budget director, said today the president-elect does not plan to
weasel out of his pledge against raising taxes by calling a tax
increase something else.
   Darman told his Senate confirmation hearing he expects Bush will
abide by the ``duck test'' _ if it looks like a tax increase, it is
a tax increase.
   Bush ``meant `no new taxes' as it would ordinarily be understood
by ordinary Americans and the duck test should be applied. If
ordinary people think it is a tax increase, it is a tax increase,''
Darman said.
   He specifically included in Bush's ``read my lips'' pledge
against tax increases a boost in the gasoline tax, higher levies on
alcohol and tobacco, removal of home mortgage interest deductions
and taxation of currently exempt employee fringe benefits like
health insurance.
   Concerned that Darman was opening the door to tax increases by
some written answers to advance questions, several members of the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee questioned him about possible
new taxes.
   In his written responses Darman had said that under some
circumstances a boost in taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and liquor
could be viewed as ``user fees.'' He had also suggested that higher
taxes on Social Security benefits might be described as a `benefit
reduction.''
   But in those answers Darman went on to say that what really
matters is the ``old `If-it-looks-like-duck' rule: If it looks like
a tax to most Americans, it's a tax.''
   During the questioning today, Darman said that a serious economic
calamity caused by the huge budget deficits might force him to
recommend that Bush violate his no-new-taxes pledge. But he
emphasized that he did not foresee such a recommendation, in large
part because it is important that a new president not lose his
credibility by reneging on a campaign promise.
   Asked how many years Bush's no-tax pledge was good for, Darman
replied, ``We might as well assume forever, certainly for some
extended period of time.''
   Darman, the point man in Bush's battle to reduce the deficit, was
widely praised by committee members for his government skills and is
expected to win confirmation easily as director of the Office of
Management and Budget.
   In his opening statement Darman said it is essential to reduce
the deficit.
   ``We must end the game of wonderland politics where cuts are
increases and going down means going up,'' Darman said.
   However, Darman said Congress and the new administration must not
lose sight of other problems facing the country.
   Unless the deficit is reduced in the right way, the country runs
the risk of economic travail, he said.
   ``We must keep America growing; we must increase savings and
investment; increase productivity and renew our pioneering spirit,''
Darman said. ``These are inescapable requirements if we are to keep
America a strong and shining beacon of hope.''
   In his opening testimony, Darman made no mention of Bush's
``flexible freeze'' approach to balancing the budget without tax
increases. But several members of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee were expected to spend quite a bit of time grilling Darman
in a search for details on Bush's plan.
   Darman, the point man in Bush's battle to reduce the deficit, is
in many ways similar to David Stockman, Reagan's first budget
director. Both men have been described as brilliant political
strategists, but they have also been accused by critics of being
abrasive and intellectually arrogant.
   Darman's role as head of the OMB will put him more in the
spotlight than he was during the Reagan years, when he served as one
of the administration's top behind-the-scenes strategists, first as
a top White House aide and then as deputy treasury secretary. In
both posts, he worked closely with James A. Baker III, nominated by
Bush to be secretary of state.
   Darman resigned from the No. 2 job at Treasury in April 1987 to
take a job with the investment banking division of Shearson Lehman
Brothers. He was lured back into politics last year when he joined
the Bush campaign, serving as a stand-in for Democratic candidate
Michael Dukakis during Bush's debate practice sessions, a role
Stockman performed for Ronald Reagan in 1980.
   During the presidential campaign, Bush repeatedly asserted that
he favored a ``flexible freeze'' on spending, with overall growth of
the budget held to the rate of inflation with only Social Security
and interest on the national debt exempt from possible spending cuts.
   Bush also proposed increased spending in a variety of areas such
as education, child care and the environment, but he repeatedly
refused to provide details on which government programs he would cut
in order to lower the budget deficit.
   President Reagan submitted his final budget last week, a $1.15
trillion spending plan for the fiscal year which begins next Oct. 1.
Bush has said he will address a joint session of Congress soon after
taking office and provide an outline of his own budget proposals.
   Bush is expected to address Congress on Feb. 9. House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said in an interview
Wednesday that he has been led to believe the details of the Bush
budget would be submitted between Feb. 10 and Feb. 15.
   However, there is still a question over whether Bush will provide
enough information to satisfy Congress. Bush is being urged by some
advisers to provide only a broad outline of spending goals rather
than specific details.
   Senate Appropriations Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said
Wednesday that Congress will be disappointed if Bush does not
provide enough details in his own spending plan.
   ``I want to see the Bush budget,'' Byrd said in an interview.
``We have to see what his priorities are.''
   Reagan's final budget projected a 1990 deficit of $92.5 billion,
below the $100 billion target established by the Gramm-Rudman law.
That law established declining deficit targets for each year leading
to a balanced budget in 1993.
   While Reagan met the Gramm-Rudman targets on paper, critics
charged that his budget relies on unrealistic assumptions about how
fast the economy will grow. It also calls for elimination of 82
government programs, all proposals which Congress has rejected in
the past.

<HEAD>Occidental Claims Sabotage Before Piper Alpha Disaster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attempt was apparently made to
sabotage the Piper Alpha platform nine months before it was swept by
fire in the world's worst oilfield disaster, Occidental Petroleum
Corp. said Thursday as the official inquiry into the disaster began.
   The platform, which was operated by Occidental and owned by the
Los Angeles-based company and a consortium, was swept by explosions
and fire on July 6 last year. The bodies of 136 of the 167 men who
died have been recovered. Sixty-two men survived.
   Occidental spokeswoman Fiona McGhie said the suspected sabotage
attempt was made in September 1987 at a time when the rig was
temporarily out of operation. She said a small number of small ball
bearings were found in one of the rig's gas compressors and removed
without incident.
   ``This information has been made available to the inquiry.'' she
said, adding that the ball bearings were found in the same area in
which the explosions occurred.
   ``I wouldn't like to hazard a guess on the consequences (if the
ball bearings were not found) other than there could have been a
serious incident,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Platform managers investigated the incident but ``nobody came
forward to claim responsibility,'' she said. The government was not
informed until after the July disaster, she added.
   The Department of Energy has already said the disaster was not
caused by sabotage. In a preliminary technical report, it said a
buildup of gas following a leak in the control module was thought to
have been the cause.
   Lord Douglas Cullen, who is conducting the inquiry with three
expert assessors, Thursday dismissed a union leader's claim that the
hearing would be restricted to ``narrow technical questions.''
   ``I am concerned with all evidence which has a tenable connection
with what occurred,'' the judge told survivors, rescuers, technical
experts, lawyers and observers at the opening day of the hearing.
   The government has asked Cullen to establish the cause of the
disaster and recommend ways of preventing a recurrence.
   Three-quarters of the platform collapsed into the sea, and two
sunken accommodation sections containing dozens of bodies were later
recovered by cranes.
   Occidental Petroleum plans to topple the 250-foot-high stump of
the shattered platform with explosives next month. It said the
wrecked rig endangers shipping.
   The blazing Piper Alpha production platform lit up the night sky
for 20 miles around as helicopters and rescue boats rushed to the
rig. The gas-fed fires raged on sporadically until leaking and
burning wells were finally brought under control by Texan oil
disaster specialist Red Adair on July 29.

   On Oct. 16, 1987 the last session before the crash, the
closely-watched index closed at 2,246.74.
   Gainers outnumbered losers today in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 770 up, 522 down and 555
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 96.69 million shares at midday.
   The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose
0.3 percent in December, bringing the increase in the index for all
of 1988 to 4.4 percent.
   The latest monthly figure was a bit lower than most advance
estimates by financial economists, and thus helped contribute to a
generally upbeat mood in the market.
   However, brokers say the market's recent strength has not seemed
to derive from current economic news, but rather from a gradual
easing of the fears that have persisted ever since the crash.
   As stock prices have risen lately, they have attracted fresh
buying from investing institutions and other market participants who
began to worry that their caution might cause them to miss a
significant rally.
   ``There's a better feeling from the market itself,'' said Michael
Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Metz said the continued strength in the dollar also boosted stock
prices. When the dollar is higher, traders believe the Federal
Reserve is less likely to tighten credit.
   A stronger dollar also makes U.S. investments more attractive to
foreigners.
   Leading the NYSE's most active list was Lyondell Petrolem, which
was unchanged at 30].
   Digital Equipment surged 5[ to 104} after the company reported
quarterly earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates.
   Polaroid climbed 3[ to 39~. Shamrock Acquisition III Inc. raised
its offer for the company from $42 a share to $45 a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.57 to 161.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .68 at 318.90.

   The United States has invited finance ministers
from six of its largest allies to meet in Washington on Feb. 3 to
review the global economic situation, a Treasury Department official
said today.
   President-elect Bush, who will be sworn in Friday, has said he
wants to have a review of the problem of Third World debt, which now
has reached $1.3 trillion.
   The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven, or G-7, would bring
together Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and his counterparts
from Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   The official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the
meeting also would allow the new members to get better acquainted.
   Brady, who took over his post last summer, met other G-7 members
last September in Berlin. Tatsuo Murayama took over as Japanese
finance minister Dec. 27.
   The Treasury official said he didn't expect that the meeting
would issue a formal statement. Such statements in the past have had
big effects on international money markets.
   As the ministers meet in Washington, the leaders of the major
Latin American debtor countries will be meeting in Caracas,
Venezuela, to discuss their problem at the inauguration of
President-elect Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela.
   Perez has been insisting that the debtors must get some relief
from the tens of billions of dollars they pay out every year in
interest. Venezuela announced Jan. 1 that it was suspending payment
on the principal of its debts.
   On Wednesday, Brazil, the largest debtor, said it was delaying
interest payments for a month. Brazil only resumed payments recently
after a suspension of nearly a year.

<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent in 1988, the
same as a year earlier, as hefty, drought-induced increases for
groceries offset stable energy prices, the government said today.
   Worry about inflationary pressures preoccupied many economists
last year, but that pressure has not produced an acceleration in
inflation thus far.
   The 4.4 percent gain in the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index matched the 1987 increase, which was the highest since 1981
but was four times the 1.1 percent rate in 1986, a 25-year low.
   A 0.3 percent rise in the index in December, which followed a 0.3
percent November increase, helped inflation finish the year at a
moderate pace.
   The summer drought, which shriveled crops and seared pastures,
pushed food prices for the year up 5.2 percent, the steepest rise
since 1980.
   Poultry and egg prices jumped 17.9 percent and 16.5 percent,
respectively, because of the drought.
   On the other hand, beef and pork prices, which rose for the first
six months of the year, fell during the second half as farmers sent
more animals to slaughter as a way of avoiding high feed costs.
   Energy for the year rose only a slight 0.5 percent following an
8.2 percent jump in 1987. Still, they were far below levels before
the 1986 oil glut,when energy prices plummeted 19.7 percent.
   Fuel oil prices jumped 2.8 percent in December after falling for
six consecutive months. Despite the December advance, the price was
6.3 percent below that of a year earlier. Electricity charges rose
1.1 percent for the year, while natural gas was unchanged.
   Gasoline prices were 1.1 percent lower than a year ago. Price
increases for new and used cars also were moderate, 2.1 percent and
3.4 percent, respectively. However, the prices of auto insurance and
of financing car purchases took steep jumps of 8.4 percent and 8.3
percent, respectively.
   The cost of medical care, up 6.9 percent, also rose faster than
the general inflation rate last year.
   Tobacco prices posted one of the steepest rises of any
subcatagory, up 9.4 percent for the year.
   Clothing prices rose 4.8 percent overall, with men's and boys'
apparel up 6.0 percent and women's and girls' clothing up 3.4
percent.
   December's 0.3 percent increase left the price index at 120.5
percent of its 1982-84 base, meaning that a hypothetical selection
of goods costing $100 during the base period would have cost $120.50
in December. That figure was up 20 cents from November.
   President Reagan, who is preparing to leave office Friday, has
listed the taming of inflation as one of his proudest
accomplishments. Under his predecessor, Jimmy Carter, the nation saw
double-digit price increases of 13.3 percent in 1979 and 12.5
percent in 1980.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the report shows that
inflation ``continues to show signs of moderation. Inflation has
been going down since September.''
   Many economists worry that the country may be in for a taste of
the bad old days this year. They say tight labor markets and rising
factory operating rates will inevitably lead to higher costs for
consumers.
   The factory operating rate in December was 84.2 percent, the
highest in nine years. The higher the rate, the greater the
likelihood of shortages and price increases.
   At 5.3 percent, the unemployment rate was the lowest in 14 years.
Labor shortages in some states, particularly in the Northeast, have
already pushed up wages for entry-level jobs.
   But other analysts say consumer resistance and foreign
competition are helping to dampen price increases.
   ``It's difficult to pass along cost pressures,'' said Donald
Ratajczak, an economist with Georgia State University. ``Consumers
will back off and wait a couple of months to see if they can get a
price discount.
   ``Domestic (production) capacity pressures ... probably don't
mean as much as they once did. There are resources readily available
offshore if our prices start to rise.''
   Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve Board, whose prime job as the
nation's central bank is keeping inflation under control, has been
pushing interest rates slowly but steadily higher since March in an
effort to slow the economy and ease inflationary pressures.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a
Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm, joined Ratajczak in predicting
only a modest speedup in price increases this year.
   ``I have more confidence in the ... Fed than I ever did,'' she
said. ``I think they'll have real trouble getting inflation down to
the 2 percent range, but I think they'll keep it from accelerating.''

<HEAD>Housing For All? Control Land Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing for the urban homeless and poor is a
relentlessly growing issue, one that housing people recognize must
soon be confronted on the basis of facts rather than ideals, hopes
and dreams.
   The fact is that the best efforts of banks, builders and
bureacrats haven't been able to do much about urban land prices,
which account for a steadily growing portion of all housing costs.
Land prices are a major culprit.
   In 1949, land accounted for a mere 11 percent of a new
single-family home, or $1,045 of the average $9,500 sale price. By
1969, it had risen to 21 percent of the $26,000 sale price, or
$5,460. By 1986, the percentage was 25 percent of a $92,000 sales
price, or $22,000 _ 20 times the figure of 37 years earlier.
   The rising price of land has all but aborted some ingenious
attempts at keeping housing prices under control or affordable to a
larger number of people.
   Mortgage lenders have devised loans in such enormous variety they
can almost be customized: adjustable rate mortgages, graduated
payment loans, 15-year mortgages, biweekly mortgages, growing
equity, shared equity loans.
   Local governments have devised mortgage revenue bonds, in which
the credit of the community is used to develop housing. They have
bought up abandoned housing. They have developed sweat equity
programs.
   The Federal government has encouraged the bundling of mortgages
into securities that are offered to investors, thus bringing in a
new flow of funds from the secondary market. The tax system has been
employed in various ways.
   The private home mortgage insurance system has encouraged banks
to lend to young families with just 5 percent down rather than the
more conventional 20 percent. The Veterans Administration and
Federal Housing Administration also have encouraged such liberal
lending.
   Suppliers of building materials have experimented with new,
lower-cost products and pressured communities that stuck to dated,
restrictive building and zoning codes. They have built low-price
demonstration houses.
   The prefabricated housing industry _ which creates precut,
panelized and modular or sectional homes _ has demonstrated it can
produce quality housing at savings over on-site construction. Same
for ``mobile'' or manufactured homes.
   Developers and builders have done their share, learning to put
more housing on less land. Better product delivery systems and
building techniques have helped lower material-labor costs to 47
percent of price in 1986 from 69 percent in 1949.
   Meanwhile, a study of 30 metropolititan areas by the Urban Land
Institute, an independent Washington-based study group, illustrates
the worsening of the land-price situation.
   The institute found that while the consumer price index rose 52
percent from 1975 to 1980, the median value of raw housing sites
rose 92.7 percent. Other studies suggest the gap might have widened
since then.
   What's the answer? Some analysts maintain that buying and holding
raw land is just too good a deal for speculators and investors not
to exploit it.
   Consider some of the benefits of ownership: While foresight is
needed, a great amount of business acumen isn't required, and there
are few, if any, operational problems. Nothing need be done to the
land but wait for others to pour money and development expertise
into abutting or nearby property.
   True, there may be no immediate income from land left idle, and
there are taxes to pay.
   Those taxes, however, are often minimal compared with benefits,
such as when taxpayers build at their expense a highway adjacent to
the property, or when a builder wants the land for a housing
development.
   Some critics of taxing policy say it might be at fault.
   Instead of taxing the developers of raw land, they contend that
perhaps we should tax the owner of idle land. Or, perhaps, charge
the landowner for taxpayer improvements, such as highways and
bridges that improve value.

<HEAD>Rising Demand, Faltering Supplies Cause Energy Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coal-rich Shaanxi province is running out of the
fossil fuel that keeps its power plants running.
   Luxury hotels in Beijing have been told to cut energy use by 30
percent during peak hours, and factories are being forced to shut
down assembly lines to ease power shortages.
   Across China, millions of workers are idled and homes are
darkened every day as the nation's surging demand for energy far
outstrips its ability to generate power.
   The problem is made worse by an inefficient transportation
system, antiquated machinery, delays in construction of new
facilities and unreasonably low energy rates.
   The People's Daily said Wednesday that Shaanxi's seven power
stations, which supply more than half the electricity in
northwestern China, are down to reserves of only 80,000 tons of coal.
   The coal shortfalls persisted through the second half of 1988,
the newspaper said. One problem has been that coal mines in Shaanxi,
which has reserves of 909.6 billion tons, have shipped coal to other
provinces to get a better price.
   China produced about 900 million tons of coal last year, more
than any country in the world, but chronic shortages in some areas
worsened as a result of transport bottlenecks and poor distribution.
   Coal is used for about 70 percent of China's generating capacity
of 100 million kilowatts of electricity. The rest comes from
hydroelectric power. Two nuclear power plants are under
construction, but China has no operating nuclear reactors.
   The official China Daily said Tuesday the lack of suitable coal
and deterioration of machines in power plants were causing serious
power shortages in the capital.
   Residents in the northwest section of the city had no power
during the evening hours three days a week, and 200 large factories
were told they will lose 40 percent of their power supply during
peak morning and evening hours on some days.
   The daily said a 2,000-employee towel factory will have to find
menial work for 300 workers during peak electricity hours because
their production line will be shut down.
   About 100 hotels, including luxury hotels catering to Western
tourists, have been asked to reduce electricity use by 30 percent
during peak hours.
   Last year the city banned the use of air conditioners and
electric heaters in all public buildings, excepting such places as
hospitals, hotels, movie theaters and laboratories.
   Coal supply shortages became so bad in coastal Jiangsu province
last year that 80 percent of enterprises temporarily suspended
production. Rice planting was delayed because there wasn't enough
electricity to pump water into the fields.
   In Sichuan, China's most populous province, power output fell 45
percent short of needs as dry weather cut generating power at
hydroelectric plants last winter. In the nation's largest city of
Shanghai, power outages cost industries $16 million in one month
last summer.
   According to official reports, in 1986 the nation lost $54
billion of gross industrial output value and $8 billion in profits
and taxes due to insufficient electricity.
   China is trying to solve the energy crisis by building new
railway lines to transport coal, raising the cost of electricity and
giving priority to energy projects.
   An official of the newly formed China Electric Power Enterprises
Federation said that by the year 2000 China hopes to reach
generating capacity of 240 million kilowatts and produce 1.2
trillion kilowatt hours annually, both more than double current
levels.
   Energy output must increase by at least that rate to keep up with
the rapidly expanding economy and rising living standards that have
made energy users such as televisions, refrigerators and air
conditioners available to urban families.
   The amount of electricity produced increased 6.5 percent a year
between 1980 and 1987, but average family use went up 20 percent
annually in the same period.

<HEAD>Tyson Nearing Completion of Deal With Holly Farms, Company Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: CORRECTS name of Justus to Justice in 3rd graf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGDALE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tyson Foods official said today the
company is preparing to raise its bid for Holly Farms Corp. to $63 a
share and that the deal is very close to completion.
   Holly Farms directors met in New York on Wednesday to consider
takeover bids from the Springdale-based Tyson and from ConAgra of
Omaha, Neb. Tyson previously offered $60 a share.
   ``They haven't really put the stamp of approval on it yet,'' said
Bob Justice, Tyson vice president for community relations. ``There
are little complications we think are sure to be ironed out.''
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for Holly Farms in Memphis, Tenn., said,
``As of 8:15 no decision has been made. And without a decision there
is no announcement.''
   ``I don't think anyone has more at stake than Tyson,'' said Leeam
Lowin, a Greenwich, Conn., investor and former Holly Farms
shareholder. ``Chicken is their whole world. ConAgra is into other
things. If there is no deal, Tyson would have the most likelihood of
having troubled times in the future.''
   Officials on all sides of the long-running battle for control of
Holly Farms and leadership of the U.S. chicken industry declined
comment Wednesday.
   ConAgra executives declined to say whether they raised their bid
for Holly Farms.
   If Holly Farms' board recommends a sale to ConAgra and if
shareholders go along with that recommendation, Holly Farms
executives have said the company is expected to operate
independently of the food conglomerate.
   If the board recommends that shareholders sell their stock to
Tyson Foods, and the shareholders follow that advice, Holly Farms
will become part of the poultry empire founded by a man who ran out
of gas in Springdale and started what became the country's largest
chicken processor.
   ConAgra is seeking court permission to proceed with a contract
reached in November to acquire Holly Farms.
   ``We intend to stick by our guns,'' ConAgra spokesman Walt Casey
said Wednesday.
   Tyson Foods, the nation's largest poultry processor, has been
trying since October to take over Holly Farms, a diversified company
heavily involved in fresh poultry sales.
   Resisting those advances, Holly Farms managers worked out a
merger agreement with ConAgra, but a Delaware court blocked it on a
request from Tyson.
   Casey said ConAgra asked the court Tuesday for permission to
continue with the Holly Farms deal, though it will likely lead to
lengthy litigation.
   Jim Blair, a Tyson lawyer, said Holly Farms managers have tried
to favor ConAgra in setting rules for receiving bids, but Holly
Farms spokesman Ted Bailey denied the allegation.
   Tyson's $60 per share offer was valued at more than $1 billion.
ConAgra has proposed a stock swap also worth about $1 billion.
   Blair said Holly managers have asked their board to amend a stock
bonus plan for about 600 management employees.
   The change would require a company buying Holly Farms for cash to
pay those employees a total of $60 million, Blair said.
   In its court challenge that stopped the Holly-ConAgra merger,
Tyson said Holly Farms managers were ignoring the best interest of
their shareholders by not considering all buyout offers equally.

<HEAD>In Age of Shoddy Goods, Zippo Still Going Strong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CASSANDRA BURRELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The story goes that George G. Blaisdell, a
Pennsylvania oilman, watched in 1932 as a friend tried to light his
cigarette with a cumbersome two-piece Austrian lighter.
   ``You're all dressed up,'' Blaisdell said. ``Why don't you get a
lighter that looks decent?''
   ``Well, George,'' the friend replied, ``it works.''
   So was born the trusty Zippo lighter, an American folk object
that stands for American durability in Blaisdell's old-fashioned
way. Blaisdell didn't just guarantee his lighters, he guaranteed
them for life, no questioned asked.
   The Zippo Manufacturing Co., based in the northern Pennsylvania
town of Bradford, is the last American cigarette lighter
manufacturer. The company shipped its 200-millionth metal lighter a
couple of months ago.
   Company officials, who offered the Blaisdell anecdote, say
Blaisdell's promise set Zippos apart from the competition, foreign
and domestic.
   ``Zippos are some of the finest,'' said Eddie Dektor, a
Pittsburgh gift shop owner who has amassed 3,000 lighters, including
more than 150 Zippos, during the past 30 years.
   ``They work very well,'' he said. ``The mechanism and the
workmanship and everything is great. They also were the only company
ever to give you a lifetime guarantee.''
   Despite a decline in the number of smokers and the popularity of
disposable lighters, business is better than ever for Zippo, said
spokesman William W. Jones.
   The introduction of cheap, disposable lighters in the 1960s
actually was good for Zippo, converting match users to use of both
disposables and metal lighters, Jones said.
   ``It made the country more lighter conscious,'' he said.
   The privately owned company does not release detailed financial
figures. But Jones said sales in 1987 topped $37 million, and more
than 80 percent of Zippo purchasers buy them as gifts.
   Zippo's slowest year was 1964, the same year the U.S. Surgeon
General placed health warnings on cigarette packs.
   ``Even then we had a good year,'' Jones said. ``Sales just didn't
grow as fast as they did in other years.''
   Dektor said Zippos are history and a symbol of enduring quality
in the modern-day age of planned obsolescence.
   According to Zippo, Blaisdell set up shop in a garage in
Bradford, a city that boasts it was once capital of the world's oil
production in the late 19th century.
   Jones said Blaisdell obtained U.S. distribution rights for the
Austrian lighter used by his friend, but he could not sell them at a
profit until he improved their design, making them more attractive
and easier to use.
   Blaisdell's fascination with another recent invention, the
zipper, invented in nearby Meadville, led him to call his new
lighter ``Zippo,'' Jones said.
   The lighters achieved worldwide fame during World War II after
war correspondent Ernie Pyle publicized them. The company says
Blaisdell became known as ``Mr. Zippo'' in Pyle newspaper columns
after Blaisdell offered to distribute Zippo lighters to servicemen
overseas.
   Zippo's entire wartime production was supplied to the military,
where they were used to light smoking lamps and campfires in swamps
and jungles, cook soup in helmets and light signal fires, not
counting lighting GIs' cigarettes from Berlin to Bataan.
   The company said one pilot landed his disabled plane safely by
using a lighter to illuminate his darkened instrument panel. There
are stories of servicemen saved when bullets were deflected off
lighters carried in pockets.
   Generals Douglas McArthur and Dwight Eisenhower wrote Blaisdell
testimonial letters saying his lighters never failed.
   Blaisdell died in 1978 at age 83 in Miami Beach, Fla.
   Today, the company is owned by Blaisdell's daughters, Sarah B.
Dorn and Harriett B. Wick, and the lighters' conservative design has
changed little since the company's founding, Jones said.
   About 200,000 dropped, crushed, mutilated or unhinged lighters
are returned every year and are repaired and returned, or replaced,
within 48 hours of their arrival, Jones said. Few people abuse the
policy.
   ``We find that there are so many honest people out there, it's
amazing,'' he said.
   Zippo once received a damaged lighter from a San Francisco
security guard who had been the target of a gunman. The guard had
been carrying the lighter in his front shirt pocket, Jones said.
   ``He was confronted by someone who was trying to break in his
building and was shot at point-blank range,'' he said.
   The guard told the company he thought he had been shot in the
chest, but found the bullet lodged in the lighter when he pulled it
out of his pocket, Jones said.
   Zippos remain a favorite of ``lighter maniacs''_ collectors who
sometimes acquire several thousand lighters as a hobby.
   ``I used to get them at flea markets, at house sales and at
antique shops,'' Dektor said. ``After a while I developed an
obsession about them. I used to get up about 5 a.m. on Sunday and
hit four flea markets in one day.''
   Earlier this year, Dektor stopped adding to his collection.
Today, he's content to browse through them, recounting the stories
behind some lighters, pointing out favorites, showing off unusual
pieces.
   About 1,200 of Dektor's lighters are displayed in two cases in
his small store. An eight-piece commemorative set featuring profiles
of Elvis Presley, bought this summer during a tour of Zippo's plant,
is displayed on one wall.
   Collections of longtime lighter enthusiasts can range in value
from $5,000 to $20,000, with individual lighters usually costing
about $3, said Tom Prylinski of Erie, president of The Lighter Side,
a 5-year-old lighter collectors' club. The Lighter Side has about
110 members in the United States, Australia, England and France.

<HEAD>Apple Unveils New Version Of Macintosh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. on Thursday unveiled a
new Model in its Macintosh computer line, one that runs four times
faster than the Macintosh SE.
   The announcement came two days after it lowered prices on some of
its other products.
   Dubbed the Macintosh SE-30, the new system packs about the same
power as Apple's top-of-the-line Macintosh II in a computer that
appears identical to the earlier transportable Macintosh products.
   Apple will show off the new computer at Macworld Expo in San
Francisco this week.
   Apple Chairman John Sculley said he expected the SE-30 to play a
vital role in Apple's success, comparing it to the company's earlier
Macintosh Plus, the first Macintosh computer with features for
business use.
   Some industry observers say the SE-30 lacks the dramatic
innovation of some earlier Apple products.
   ``They said the same thing about the Macintosh Plus,'' Sculley
said. ``Almost everybody in the media panned it, and all it did was
save the company.''
   Reaction to the new product was subdued.
   ``It's not exciting, but it's necessary for their product line,''
said Tim Bajarin, executive vice president of Creative Strategies
Research International, a market research company in Santa Clara.
   The SE-30 is available in three configurations ranging in price
from $4,500 to $6,700 depending on the amount of memory and size of
the hard disk.
   ``It's expensive,'' said Tom Lafleur, director of engineering at
Qualcomm Inc. The San Diego satellite communications company uses
about 200 Macintosh computers.

<HEAD>Wayne Newton Accepts Libel Award of $6 Million</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with background, further quotes, details;

   Entertainer Wayne Newton said today he will
accept a $6 million libel award in his long-running lawsuit against
NBC, saying he feels vindicated from a nearly 9-year-old report that
linked him to the Mafia.
   ``This was not a matter of money,'' Newton told reporters at a
morning news conference. ``This was a matter of vindication of my
name.''
   Newton's attorney, Morton Galane, said the interest accrued on
the reduced $5.3 million award now equals $6 million.
   ``Such an award would be higher than any (libel) award ever
affirmed by an appellate court in the United States,'' he said.
   The case does not yet appear to be over, however. NBC attorneys
had indicated earlier they would appeal the award to higher federal
courts.
   Newton said that as far as he was concerned the case was over for
him personally. He said that if NBC appeals he will leave the matter
to his attorneys.
   Galane told reporters that one factor in Newton's decision to
accept the award was a survey of public attitudes toward Newton's
acceptance of such a high award.
   ``Three weeks ago that survey confirmed that the public believes
that the reporting of a high libel award in favor of Mr. Newton
would be perceived by others as restoration of a positive public
image,'' Galane said.
   In late December U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker gave Newton
until Feb. 1 to accept the award, which had been reduced from $22.8
million, or face the prospect of proving his case against NBC in a
new trial.
   Newton won the original amount against the network when a jury
ruled the singer was defamed in a series of broadcasts that linked
him to organized crime figures.
   Crocker later threw out all but $5.3 million of the award and
gave Newton the option of accepting the money or seeking a new trial
strictly on damages.
   The Newton-NBC case stems from an Oct. 6, 1980, broadcast titled
``Wayne Newton and the Law.''
   NBC correspondent Brian Ross reported that Newton had gone to
organized crime figure Guido Penosi for help after his
then-3-year-old daughter's life had been threatened.
   Newton argued the report left the impression that his October
1980 purchase of the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas was linked to
organized crime. The hotel has since been sold and is currently
owned by a Japanese businessman.
   Asked today if he would again ask for Penosi's help, Newton said,
``I would go to the devil himself to save my daughter's life.''
   Newton emphasized that his lawsuit was not meant to suppress
reporting of the news.
   ``All I hope is that responsible journalists will think before
they do to someone what they did to me,'' he said.

   The stock market was narrowly mixed today after
temporarily surpassing the level where it stood just before the
October 1987 crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was unchanged at 2,238.75
at 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Earlier in the session, the widely followed index was up more
than 10 points and moved past 2,246.74, where it closed on Oct. 16,
1987, the last trading day before the crash.
   Profit-taking in blue chip issues eroded today's gains in the
average. But advancing issues outnumbered losers by a margin of
about 4-to-3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
issues, with 790 up, 631 down and 512 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 142.90 million shares at
mid-afternoon.
   The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose
0.3 percent in December, bringing the increase in the index for all
of 1988 to 4.4 percent.
   The latest monthly figure was a bit lower than most advance
estimates by financial economists, and thus helped contribute to a
generally upbeat mood in the market.
   However, brokers say the market's recent strength has not seemed
to derive from current economic news, but rather from a gradual
easing of the fears that have persisted ever since the crash.
   As stock prices have risen lately, they have attracted fresh
buying from investing institutions and other market participants who
began to worry that their caution might cause them to miss a
significant rally.
   ``There's a better feeling from the market itself,'' said Michael
Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. He noted that on Wednesday,
despite a disappointing trade deficit report, the Dow Jones average
gained more than 24 points.
   Leading the NYSE's most active list was Lyondell Petroleum, a
spin-off of Atlantic Richfield Corp. that was quoted at 30\ in its
first day on the Big Board.
   Digital Equipment surged 4} to 104] after the company reported
quarterly earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates.
   Polaroid climbed 3 to 39}. Shamrock Acquisition III Inc. raised

<HEAD>Farley Again Extends Pepperell Offer, Challenges Another Defense</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farley Inc. extended its $1.4 billion hostile
tender offer for West Point-Pepperell Inc. on Thursday and asked a
federal judge to invalidate another of the textile company's
takeover defenses.
   It was the eighth extension in Farley's tender offer, which is
$48 per share. The deadline, which has been bumped back a week to
two weeks at a time since it was first set for Nov. 21, now is set
for midnight Jan. 25.
   In a motion filed in U.S. District Court, the Chicago-based
conglomerate, which controls Fruit of the Loom Inc. and Acme Boot
Co., asked Judge G. Ernest Tidwell to invalidate Pepperell's
so-called ``flip-over'' provisions that would allow its shareholders
to buy shares at a discount in an uninvited suitor.
   Most analysts, however, view the legal wrangling as delaying
tactics, giving Pepperell management time to put together their own
response.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pepperell was up 37{
cents a share at $45.62{ at midafternoon.
   In extending the tender offer, Farley said it currently has
received tender offers for about 14 million shares, which together
with the 2.9 million shares Farley already owns account for about 57
percent of Pepperell's outstanding shares.
   The amount of shares tendered has varied little since late
December, but Farley officials said that is to be expected.
   Farley's offer for the West Point, Ga.-based company is
contingent on being tendered, or owning outright, two-thirds of
Pepperell's outstanding shares, as well as overturning the textile
company's takeover defenses and voiding Georgia's anti-takeover law.
   The motion filed with Tidwell on Thursday was placed under seal,
as has much of the evidence in previous court challenges of the
takeover.
   But Farley said in a statement that the ``flip-over'' provision
``has no legitimate business purpose and harms West Point's
shareholders.''
   Even though Farley is not publicly traded, the ``flip-over''
would allow Pepperell shareholders to purchase Farley shares at a
discount, effectively reducing William Farley's control of his own
company.
   Tidwell previously has voided Pepperell's ``flip-in'' provisions,
which give shareholders the right to purchase more Pepperell stock
at a deep discount.
   That ruling has been appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, where a decision is pending.
   Tidwell also is considering Farley's claim that the state's 1988
anti-takeover law is unconstitutional. A court-appointed expert told
Tidwell last week that he believed the conditions set on mergers
were too restrictive and therefore improperly restrained trade.
   A ruling had been expected last week, but there currently is no
indication of when one will come.
   Farley also has succeeded in calling a special shareholders
meeting for Feb. 25, where his company will seek to oust current
Pepperell directors, replacing them with its own slate which then
would toss out the takeover defenses.
   Pepperell is the nation's largest publicly traded textile
company, with products including Martex towels and sheets and Arrow
shirts.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell against most major currencies
in busy European trading on Thursday. Gold prices were higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers said nine central banks, including the
U.S. Federal Reserve, intervened to halt the dollar's rise in the
morning with mixed results.
   Dealers said that as the dollar surge continued, the Fed and
government banking authorities from three other countries entered
the market a second time with more success. But by the end of the
day the dollar had resumed rising.
   The dealers said central bankers clearly did not want to see the
dollar as high as it was Wednesday, when it surged despite the
announced higher-than-expected U.S. trade deficit.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7615 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's $1.7550.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Wednesday's late rates were: 1.8672 West German marks, down from
1.8705; 1.5805 Swiss francs, down from 1.5890; 6.3315 French francs,
down from 6.3800; -2.1060 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0925; 1,368.50
Italian lire, up from 1,356.75; and, 1.1890 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1937.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.20 Japanese yen, up
from 127.90 yen. Late Thursday, in London, the dollar traded lower
at 128.75 yen.
   Gold bullion prices were modestly higher in light dealings as the
dollar's fluctuations commanded the attention.
   In London, gold closed at $402.50 bid a troy ounce, up from
$402.25. The Zurich closing bid was $403.40, up from $402.40.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at a bid $403.83, down from
$404.64.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.97 bid a troy ounce,
up from $5.94.

<HEAD>Texas Eastern Posts $40.3 Million Fourt Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Eastern Corp., the subject of a hostile
takeover bid launched this week by Coastal Corp., said Thursday its
fourth-quarter profit rose 28.3 percent while its earnings for all
of 1988 increased by 58 percent from 1987.
   The gas pipeline company attributed the yearly gains to the net
positive impact of $90 million from nonrecuring transactions and
other items.
   For the three-month period ended Dec. 31, Texas Eastern said its
after-tax profit totaled $40.3 million, or 75 cents a share, up from
$31.4 million, or 59 cents a share, in the same 1987 period.
   The Houston-based company said its fourth-quarter earnings
reflected non-recurring gains and charges with a net positive impact
of about $8 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with about $7
million, or 13 cents per share, in the 1987 period.
   Operating revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $985.6 million
in 1988 and $924.1 million in 1987.
   For all of 1988, Texas Eastern posted earnings of $151.9 million,
or $2.85 per share, compared with $96.1 million, or $1.80 per share,
in 1987.
   Texas Eastern's operating income for 1988 was nearly $3.5
billion, compared with $3.6 billion the previous year.
   Executives from Texas Eastern and Houston-based Coastal plan to
meet this weekend for the first time since Coastal announced a $2.6
billion offer for all outstanding shares of Texas Eastern stock.
   Coastal said its tender offer for Texas Eastern had commenced
Tuesday at $42 per share and that the offer would expire Feb. 13,
unless it is extended. If the buyout is successful, the
Coastal-Texas Eastern pipelines would be the nation's largest in the
volume of gas transported.

<HEAD>Brazilian Interest Payments Continue To Boost Some Bank Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   BankAmerica Corp. and three other big banking companies on
Thursday reported profits for the last quarter of 1988 and the full
year, with some reaping the benefits of Brazil's payment of back
interest.
   The banking concerns, which also included Bankers Trust New York
Corp., Bank of Boston Corp. and Bank of New York Co., said they
benefited from the overall improvement in the Third World debt
crisis, which had peaked in 1987.
   Meanwhile, two large savings and loan holding companies, Great
Western Bank of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Glenfed Inc. of Glendale,
Calif., also reported mostly higher earnings in their latest reports.
   BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, said net income for the
three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $265 million, or $1.36 per share,
more than four times as high as earnings of $60 million, or 27 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   The company said the latest results included $351 million in cash
interest payments from Brazil, which just a year ago had declared a
temporary moratorium on commercial bank interest payments.
   For the year, BankAmerica netted $726 million, or $3.79 per
share, in contrast with a a loss of $955 million for 1987. The
previous year's results reflected a second-quarter $1.1 billion
addition to its loan-loss reserves to cover shaky Third World loans.
   New-York based Bankers Trust said its fourth-quarter income
totaled $185.5 million, or $2.29 a share, compared with a record
$284.5 million, or $3.70 a share, in the previous year. The company
blamed the decline partly on lower trading volume.
   But Bankers Trust said its 1988 income reached a record $647.7
million, or $8.09 a share. That compared with earnings of $1.2
million, or 2 cents a share, in 1987, when the company added $636
million to its loan-loss reserves.
   It said it received about $95 million in Brazilian interest
payments in the fourth quarter.
   Bank of Boston said it earned $83 million, or $1.18 a share, in
the fourth quarter, in contrast with a $41 million loss in the
previous year, when it added $200 million to its loan-loss provision.
   For the year, the Boston-based company netted a record $322
million, or $4.66 a share, compared with 1987 earnings of $20
million, or 10 cents a share.
   Bank of New York said it earned $54.7 million in the fourth
quarter, a 19 percent increase over the $45.9 million earned in
1987. But earnings per share declined 11 percent on a fully diluted
basis last year, to $1.10 from $1.24.
   The New York company said the securities issued in the acquisiton
of Irving Bank Corp. at the end of last year had diluted per-share
earnings.
   For the year, net income was a record $213.0 million, or $5.21 a
share, compared with $103.4 million, or $2.81, in 1987.
   Great Western said its fourth-quarter profit was $59.7 million,
or 47 cents a share, up from $13.7 million, or 11 cents a share a
year earlier. Annual income totaled $248 million, or $1.95 a share,
up 17 percent from $212 million, or $1.66 a share, in 1987.
   Glenfed said that in the second fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31 it
earnings before extraordinary items totaled $35.16 million, or $1.19
a share, vs. $32.56 million, or $1.11 per share, the year before.
But for the six months, it's net income dropped to $66.60 million,
or $2.27 a share, from $67.20 million, or $2.29, a share.

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 454 money market mutual
funds rose by $2.20 billion in the latest week to a new all-time
high of $284.59 billion, the Investment Company Institute said
Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a $4.36
billion rise the previous week, the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group said. It was the second straight time a new record was
reached.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 226 general
purpose funds fell $2.9 million to $90.17 billion, assets of 91
broker-dealer funds increased $1.21 billion to $120.48 billion, and
assets of 137 institutional funds rose $998.2 million to $73.93
billion.
   ``Assets of funds in the broker-dealer category continued to lead
the way in boosting total assets of money-market funds to new record
highs,'' said Jacob Dreyer, the institute's senior vice president
and chief economist.
   ``The typical start-of-year inflow of monies into money-market
funds has been reinforced this year by an extremely favorable yields
offered by these funds relative to the yields available both on
competing short-term investments and on most longer-term
investments,'' he said.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.35 percent from 8.28 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.30 percent from 8.22 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 30
days, unchanged from the prior week, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts rose to 6.26 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.24 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, dipped to 5.13 percent from 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.30
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.26 the
previous week. Yields were 8.54 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.51
percent; 8.65 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.63 percent; and 8.77
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.75 percent.

   Foreign currency traders who want to make a
mark on the market can make one first with a snowball Friday when
the Philadelphia Stock Exchange opens expanded early morning trading
hours.
   The exchange is introducing a 4:30 a.m. starting time _ 3{ hours
earlier than its current opening time _ to let currency trading
coincide with morning hours in Europe. A half-hour before the
opening, the exchange is hosting a snowball throwing contest
officials expect could become a snowball fight.
   ``Maybe if we throw a snowball in somebody's face they'll
listen,'' exchange president Nicholas Giordano said Thursday.
   ``Sometimes you've got to do something corny to get people's
attention to listen to the substance.''
   The new hours will be 4:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 10
p.m., the latter period begun in September 1987 to cover the
Japanese morning hours.
   Giordano said he couldn't estimate what kind of volume to expect
with the new hours, but said there is demand for the change.
   ``In our visits to our members and customers in Europe, they have
been requesting these hours for some time now,'' Giordano said,
adding they have had ``to to sit around to 1 p.m.'' local time
waiting for the 8 a.m. opening of the Philadelphia exchange.
   ``Whether some of that business will move from the afternoon to
the morning and how much will be new business remains to be seen,''
he said.
   David Cohen, vice president of Tague Securities, the exchange's
designated specialist firm in the German mark and the Japanese yen,
said the new trading hours will mean less sleep for him but more
convenience for the Europeans.
   As for the snowball throwing, Cohen expects to be at the exchange
by 4 a.m., getting ready for the trading day.
   ``Hopefully I won't get hit in the head,'' he said.
   Lacking snow in a mild winter, officials are trucking it in, and
lacking sunlight at 4 a.m., they're setting up flood lights. Jack
Frost Mountain Ski Area of Lake Harmony, Pa., is bringing in 42
cubic yards of snow, officials said.
   Snowball throwers will have five official targets _ symbols of
some of the eight foreign currencies traded at the exchange _ but
others may develop.
   ``The temptation of having a snowball in your hand and throwing
it at someone is almost too great to resist,'' Giordano said.
   So, does the stock exchange president have a target or two in
mind?
   ``I do, but I'm not going to disclose them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Champion, Bowater Report Increased Profit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A healthy market for paper and paper products in 1988 helped
boost Champion International Corp.'s annual profit 19 percent, while
Bowater Inc.'s net income more than doubled last year, the companies
reported Thursday.
   Champion, based in Stamford, Conn., reported its 1988 after-tax
profit rose to $456.4 million, or $4.65 a share, from $382 million,
or $3.92 a share, in 1987. The company's revenue totaled $5.1
billion, up 11 percent from $4.6 billion in 1987.
   For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, the wood and paper products
company had reported net income of $119.89 million, or $1.22 a
share, up 46 percent from $82 million, or 85 cents a share, in the
same 1987 quarter.
   ``It's been very, very good,'' said Andrew C. Sigler, Champion
chairman. ``Markets for the grades of paper we produce were as
strong as we've ever seen.''
   Bowater, the largest U.S. newsprint manufacturer based in Darien,
Conn., said its fourth-quarter profit rose 54 percent to $45.5
million, or $1.22 a share, from 29.6 million, or 77 cents a share,
in the same 1987 period.
   The company's revenue rose to $367.3 million to $349.2 million,
an increase of 5 percent.
   For all of 1988, Bowater's profit soared a record 102 percent to
$164.3 million, or $4.37 a share, from $81.1 million, or $2.12 a
share, in 1987, the company reported. Sales for the year totaled
$1.4 billion, up 14.6 percent from $1.2 billion in 1987.
   ``With stable operating costs, strong pricing for our pulp and
paper grades, and a favorable dollar exchange rate to support our
export trade, all our plans made since we became public in 1984 bore
fruit,'' said Anthony P. Gammie, Bowater's chairman and chief
operating officer.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures closed moderately higher Thursday on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid mounting concern about dry weather
in winter wheat growing areas, while corn and soybean prices
finished mostly lower.
   Analysts said the rally in the wheat market was fanned by
Wednesday's 6-to-10-day weather outlook from the National Weather
Service, which predicted continued drier-than-normal conditions from
Texas to Nebraska.
   ``I think we'll continue to extend upward until some
precipitation is perceived there,'' said Richard Feltes, director of
commodity research with Refco Inc., a large Chicago-based futures
brokerage firm.
   Last week's Agriculture Department crop report, which indicated
winter wheat growers had planted fewer acres than analysts had
expected, has given the market a firm layer of support, he said.
   Liquidation of soybean and corn futures resumed Thursday
following a one-day pause in the sell-off sparked by the USDA's
report of larger-than-expected supplies of those commodities.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.42} a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
to 3{ cents lower with March at $2.68 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
3} cents lower with March at $2.34 a bushel; soybeans were 10 cents
lower to 4\ cents higher with January at $7.53 a bushel.

   Prices closed slightly higher on Wall Street
today after the stock market made a brief foray past the level where
it stood just before the October 1987 crash.
   Brokers said traders were generally upbeat because of the
market's recent advances. Stocks gave back some of the gains they
ran up in early trading today, but analysts were unconcerned and
attributed the declines to profit-taking.
   Around midday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial session was
up more than 10 points, moving past 2,246.74, where it closed on
Oct. 16, 1987, the last trading day before the crash.
   The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose
0.3 percent in December, bringing the increase in the index for all
of 1988 to 4.4 percent.
   The latest monthly figure was a bit lower than most advance
estimates by financial economists, and thus helped contribute to a
generally upbeat mood in the market.
   However, brokers say the market's recent strength has not seemed
to derive from current economic news, but rather from a gradual
easing of the fears that have persisted ever since the crash.
   As stock prices have risen lately, they have attracted fresh
buying from investing institutions and other market participants who
began to worry that their caution might cause them to miss a
significant rally.
   ``There's a better feeling from the market itself,'' said Michael
Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.

<HEAD>Dollar's Rise Could Cause Long-Term Damage To U.S. Trade</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recent speculation-fueled rise in the dollar
could cause long-term damage to the U.S. trade balance by making
American goods less competitive in world markets.
   Trade flows respond slowly but surely to changes in currency
rates, economists say. If the dollar's latest rise lasts, it could
halt or even reverse progress toward shrinking the trade gap.
   As the world's largest debtor, the United States eventually will
have to produce a trade surplus in order to generate enough money to
keep up on rent, interest and dividends to foreigners.
   On Thursday, the dollar fell against most major currencies in
response to dollar-selling by major central banks. But since its
lows of late November, the dollar is up 6 percent against the
Japanese yen and 8 percent against the West German mark.
   The dollar actually is not far above its levels of a year ago _
the problem is that many economists believe the dollar needs to be
falling to promote U.S. exports and keep a lid on imports.
   ``If exports do respond nicely to dollar changes, what do we have
ahead of us now that the dollar is no longer falling?'' Donald
Ratajczak, head of Georgia State University's Economic Forecasting
Center, said Thursday.
   The dollar appeared to defy gravity this week when it surged
upward despite reports of an unexpectedly large U.S. trade deficit
and a record Japanese trade surplus.
   Analysts say currency dealers, who once panicked at the slightest
evidence of deterioration in U.S. trade, have decided they can
safely ignore trade figures.
   They may be partially right. The central banks of the big
industrial democracies are suspending the economic law of gravity by
committing themselves to keeping a floor under the dollar.
   Without meaning to, the central banks are making the world safe
for speculators. Foreign investors believe they can put money in
dollars to take advantage of high U.S. interest rates without
worrying that the dollar will be allowed to crash and wipe out their
gains.
   Having tested the dollar's lows shortly after the election of
George Bush in November, speculators are testing the highest levels
that the central banks will tolerate.
   In the way it has swept skeptics aside, the dollar's
juggernaut-like rise resembles the rise in stocks in the bull market
of summer 1987 _ which preceded the October crash of that year.
   ``If you push the dollar up enough then people will start
wavering in their longer-term views and at a certain point they'll
throw in their towel'' and join in the buying, said Stephen Leach, a
currency analyst at Chemical Bank.
   A cheaper dollar is not a cure-all for America's trade ills, of
course. The United States has to take action on other fronts, such
as saving more and making goods the rest of the world wants.
   Still, a low-priced currency helps. The brilliant performance of
the U.S. export sector last year was a late but direct result of the
dollar's decline in 1985 through 1987.
   While currency traders have chosen to ignore the trade gap lately
and focus instead on the U.S. interest rate advantage, it seems
inevitable that persistent trade gaps will eventually demand
attention.
   The central banks' ability to intervene is puny compared to the
size of the worldwide foreign-exchange market. They may not be able
to keep the dollar's decline orderly if psychology suddenly switches
against it.
   ``The dollar will go up until it reaches the point where
everybody thinks it's going to fall, and then it will fall hard,''
Ratajczak predicted.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Advises Caution in Dealing with Corporate Takeovers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee said Thursday that lawmakers will have to consider how the
economy would be affected if they try to crack down on corporate
takeovers.
   ``I think there's an appetite here on the (Capitol) Hill to do
something,'' the chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., told
reporters. The big question, he added, ``is whether we can write a
law without causing a downturn in the economy.''
   As he has in the past, Rostenkowski indicated he thinks Congress
will act to reverse a recent trend that has seen a sharp increase in
borrowing to finance corporate takeovers and other acquisitions,
including the use of leveraged buyouts. However, he declined to
predict whether any law will be changed.
   ``Something really should be done, particularly when we are
seeing the junk-bond abuse,'' he said, referring to high-risk,
high-yield bonds that are often used to finance takoevers.
   Rostenkowski added he is ``concerned with the fact we shouldn't
have a meat axe when we are engaged in writing law, if we are going
to write law.''
   At Rostenkowski's insistence, the House in 1987 approved some
limitations on tax benefits associated with corporate borrowing. But
some analysts cited that action as one reason for the October stock
market crash, and the proposals were dropped.
   ``Some of the people who criticized us when we wrote that
amendment are now suggesting there's a need for it,'' Rostenkowski
said.
   The Senate Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee
have scheduled public hearings this month and next on takeovers and
the broad subject of corporate financing in general.
   Rostenkowski noted several other House committees are planning
their own investigations. But he emphasized that his panel and the
Senate Finance Committee, which control the tax law, should have the
major role.
   ``You get their attention when you tickle the tax code,'' he
said. The key question involved in the issue is how the law treats
the deductibility of interest used to finance takoevers,
Rostenkowski said.
   Economists say a major reason for the growing shift toward
corporate debt and away from stocks is the fact a corporation can
deduct interest on debt but not dividends on stock.

<HEAD>Health Crusader Says His Campaign Against Tropical Oils Will Continue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A health advocate whose campaign helped prompt
nine major food processors to start removing highly saturated
vegetable oils from their products vowed Thursday to continue his
crusade until all such fats are eliminated.
   ``The battle is far from won. There are hundreds of products out
there with highly saturated coconut and palm oil,'' said Phil
Sokolof.
   Sokolof, a multimillionaire Omaha businessman, announced Monday
that five major food processors joined four others that earlier said
they would work toward eliminating the ``tropical'' oils from their
products.
   ``Our victory was getting nine food giants to switch to the good
vegetable oils, and hopefully the entire industry will follow,'' he
said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   But some food processors say switching to other fats is not as
simple as just changing ingredients. They say tropical oils impart a
certain taste and texture to some foods, such as cookies.
   Among products containing coconut and palm oils are crackers,
cookies, candies, cereals, cooking ingredients, desserts, frozen
foods, canned goods and TV dinners.
   Ron Wirtz, the librarian of the American Institute of Baking in
Manhattan, Kan., said tropical oils have other desirable properties,
such as a resistence to spoilage and lower cost than certain other
vegetable oils. In addition, he said, they are superior for use in
frostings and coatings because they are stable at room temperature.
   Wirtz said the use of tropical oils in food products wasn't
common until the late 1960s. Many made the switch because the oils
were cheaper than alternative fats.
   Sokolof said he has spent $2 million of his own money on his
cholesterol-awareness campaign. In November he placed full-page ads
in five newspapers warning of the dangers of tropical oils and
listing brand names of products that contain them.
   ``Most people know that meat, dairy products, McDonald's
hamburgers are high in saturated fat. They did not know that coconut
and palm oil are,'' he said.
   Saturated fats can increase blood cholesterol levels; high
cholesterol is a risk factor for heart attacks. Sokolof, 66, blames
high cholesterol for the near-fatal heart attack he suffered 22
years ago.
   Sokolof said he will place additional newspaper ads, but they may
be broadened to include warnings about the health risks of eating
certain dairy products and meats. He also said he will point out the
use of lard and beef tallow in certain processed foods.
   ``The most important statistic the public should know is that for
every 1 percent the cholesterol level is lowered, the chance of
having a heart attack is reduced 2 percent,'' he said.
   Most of the companies that said they would phase out the use of
tropical oils said they were responding to consumer and health
concerns, not pressure from Sokolof.
   Sokolof said he believes his campaign was part of the companies'
decision-making process, but agreed the public will be the ultimate
reason food processors switch oils.
   ``If the public reads ingredient labels and does not buy the
highly saturated fat foods, companies will get the message and
respond,'' he said.
   Sokolof established his non-profit advocacy group, the National
Heart Savers Association, in 1975.
   The nine companies that said they would eliminate tropical oils
are: General Mills Inc., Ralston Purina Co., Borden Inc., Pillsbury
Co., Quaker Oats Co., Kellogg Co., Sunshine Biscuits Inc., Campbell
Soup Co.'s Pepperidge Farm division and Keebler Co.

   Gerber Products Co. said Thursday that its
fiscal third-quarter profit nearly doubled on rising baby food sales.
   Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $19.1
million, or 96 cents a share, up from $9.7 million, or 49 cents a
share, a year ago. Quarterly sales rose to $240.1 million from
$227.1 million.
   For the first nine months of the fiscal year, Gerber netted $59.5
million, or $3.01 a share, on sales of $757.6 million. That compared
with earnings of $24.4 million, or $1.24 a share, and sales of
$683.7 million in the year-earlier period.
   The company said earnings would have been higher had it not been
for $2.5 million in losses from a baby furniture operation it sold
in December.
   Losses from discontinued operations cut earnings by $12.9 million
in the 1987 nine-month period.
   Besides a strong showing in baby food sales, income also
increased in Gerber's apparel group, which sells items under the
Gerber, Curity, Buster Brown and Weather Tamer brands, the company
said.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pfizer Inc. said Thursday that strong sales in consumer and
health care products helped boost its profit to an all-time high of
$791.3 million last year, while Bristol-Myers said its profit
margins rose for the 16th consecutive year.
   For all of 1988, Pfizer's per-share profit totaled $4.70 a share,
up 15 percent from $690.2 million, or $4.08 a sare in 1987. Its
revenue rose 9 percent to $5.4 billion, from $4.92 billion in 1987.
   Pfizer's fourth-quarter net income was up 4 percent to $141.6
million, or 84 cents a share, from $136.6 million, or 82 cents a
share, in the year-earlier quarter. The company's sales during the
quarter rose 7 percent to $1.4 billion, from $1.3 billion in 1987.
   Pfizer, whose largest-selling drug is the arthritis medicine
Feldene, said sales in its consumer segment rose 54 percent and in
its health care segment, 8 percent.
   Pfizer Chairman Edmund T. Pratt Jr. said the company continued to
invest heavily in research and development and began increasing its
U.S. sales force in preparation for the introduction of a range of
new drugs.
   ``The roll-out of these new products worldwide is starting to be
reflected in Pfizer's sales,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers reported that for the fourth quarter
ended Dec. 31, its profit rose 12.4 percent to $195.6 million, or 68
cents a share, on sales of $1.5 billion. In the same 1987 period,
its net income was $174.1 million, or 61 cents a share, on sales of
$1.4 billion.
   For the year, Bristol-Myers' profit rose 16.8 percent to $829
million, or $2.88 a share, compared with $709.6 million, or $2.47 a
share. Its revenue for the year totaled $5.97 billion, up 10.6
percent from $5.4 billion in 1987, the company said.
   Richard L. Gelb, chairman of Bristol-Myers, said the company's
profit margins improved for the 16th straight year, due in part to
strong international sales, which rose 21 percent. Gelb said
exchange rate fluctuations contributed to the company's gains.

<HEAD>Citing Customer Confusion, Coors Drops `Original Draft' From Label</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE WHEELAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adolph Coors Co. on Thursday dropped the
7-month-old ``Original Draft'' label from its flagship beer, saying
too many customers thought the label change also signaled a taste
change.
   Last July, Coors replaced its longtime ``Banquet Beer'' tag with
the words ``Original Draft'' as part of an effort to update its
packaging, but the move backfired.
   ``People believed we changed the beer,'' said Mike Marranzino,
brand director for the brewery based in Golden, west of Denver. ``It
looked like a new brand name to them. But we didn't change the
beer.''
   New labels on cans and bottles that will reach store shelves in
three weeks simply will say ``Coors,'' Marranzino said.
   He said design changes made to the cans and packaging when the
Original Draft name was added will be retained because beer drinkers
like the ``contemporary look.''
   The Coors experience in some ways recalls Coca-Cola Co.'s
experiment in April 1985, when it replaced its original cola flavor
with a new one. The ensuing customer protest forced Coca-Cola to
bring back the old formula three months later, renaming it Coca-Cola
Classic.
   Marranzino said the Original Draft label was prompted by Miller
Brewing Co.'s successful advertising campaign promoting its bottled
draft beer. Coors wanted to tell customers it had been making
bottled draft beer for 30 years, he said.
   The other changes included toning down the can color from yellow
to buff, adding stripes to the can bottom and replacing the old
red-and-white packaging with an updated red-white-and-blue diagonal
design.
   Coors spokesman Doyle Albee said the label change had no
discernible effect on earnings, which reached record levels in 1988.
``We are simply responding to requests from customers,'' Albee said.
   Added Marrazino, ``The use of Original Draft has not performed
well for us, and it has created enough confusion that we will simply
remove the phrase, keeping the new graphics look.''
   Early signs of customer dissatisfaction surfaced last fall among
Coors loyalists in El Paso, Texas, and Southern California. Sales
fell in some liquor stores and taverns as cans and bottles bearing
the new label replaced the old Banquet Beer labels.
   Last month, Coors announced it would reintroduce the Banquet Beer
label in those two markets in an attempt to appease disgruntled
customers.
   Marranzino said beer with the Banquet Beer label will continue to
be shipped to El Paso and Southern California ``as long as they want
it.''

   PPG Industries Inc. on Thursday reported a 6
percent increase in its fourt-quarter profit and a 24 percent jump
in earnings for all of 1988.
   Net income for the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $102.3
million, or 94 cents a share, on sales of $1.4 billion. That
compared with earnings of $96.5 million, or 85 cents a share, and
sales of $1.3 billion a year ago.
   For the year, the company netted $467.6 million, or $4.26 a
share, on sales of $5.6 billion. In 1987, PPG's profit totaled
$377.1 million, or $3.19 a share, on $5.2 billion in sales.
   Chairman Vincent A. Sarni said gains were made in the company's
glass, coatings and chemicals division, its major businesses.
   ``For 1989 we expect to improve on our 1988 earnings
performance,'' Sarni said.

<HEAD>Digital Earnings Fall 15.1 Percent; Microsoft Rises 34.4 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp., the world's second-biggest computer
maker, said Thursday its earnings fell 15.1 percent in the latest
fiscal quarter, but the results were better than analysts expected.
   Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp., the biggest personal computer
software company, said earnings jumped 34.4 percent in the latest
quarter.
   Digital stock rose $5.25 a share to $104.87{ in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading. Microsoft rose $2 a share to $53.50 in
over-the-counter trading.
   Digital, of Maynard, Mass., said earnings fell 15.1 percent to
$279.6 million, or $2.20 a share, in its second fiscal quarter from
$329.5 million, or $2.48 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 14
percent to $3.18 billion from $2.78 billion.
   Despite the earnings decline, Digital reported stronger demand,
lower expenses and wider profit margins than analysts had expected,
said Marc Schulman of UBS Securities, the investment banking arm of
Union Bank of Switzerland.
   Tighter controls on costs will help earnings if the computer
business turns sluggish in 1989, Schulman said.
   ``Digital is beginning to see improvements in its cost trends.
One example of this cost containment is the fact that Digital's
hiring pace has slowed,'' the company said in a statement.
   Employment rose 1,250 in the quarter to 124,400, the company said.
   Digital's announcement came one day after International Business
Machines Corp., its bigger rival, reported a 12.4 percent quarterly
earnings gain.
   For the first half of its fiscal year, Digital said its earnings
fell 16.1 percent to $503 million, or $3.90 a share, from $599.5
million, or $4.50 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15 percent
to $6.12 billion from $5.31 billion.
   Microsoft, of Redmond, Wash., said its earnings rose to $47.5
million, or 85 cents a share, in its second fiscal quarter, from
$35.3 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 35
percent to $209.9 million from $155.9 million a year earlier.
   For the first half of its fiscal year, Microsoft said its
earnings rose 49 percent to $84.1 million, or $1.50 a share, from
$56.6 million, or $1.02 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 49
percent to $386.3 million from $258.5 million.
   Microsoft said international revenue, accounting for 57 percent
of its business, was particularly strong. It was the company's 13th
consecutive quarter of record revenue.

<TEXT>
   Central banks slammed the dollar lower Thursday,
cooling a rally that had brought the U.S. currency to its highest
levels since early October.
   Gold bullion prices were modestly higher in light dealings.
Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $403.60 a
troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $401.75 late Wednesday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said one round of dollar-selling by nine
central banks was unsuccessful, but a second round drove the dollar
lower against most currencies.
   Dollar sales were accompanied by West Germany's central bank
raising two key interest rates, a step intended to make yields on
German securities more attractive and keep investors from switching
from marks to dollars.
   The dollar had gotten as high as 129.8 Japanese yen and 1.88
marks before the successful attack by the central banks at
midmorning in New York.
   On Wednesday, the dollar had risen strongly despite two negative
reports: a bigger-than-expected U.S. trade deficit and a record
Japanese trade surplus.
   The dollar was due for a pullback, at least a temporary one, said
Frank Conte, vice president for foreign exchange at Barclays Bank in
New York.
   ``It just can't continue at this momentum. Since January we've
had a one-way direction, up,'' he said.
   William N. Griggs, managing director of Griggs &amp; Santow Inc.,
said he believed the dollar had gotten too cheap and the current
rise ``looks more like a return to reality or a correction.''
   But Griggs said, ``There's no way to prove what the appropriate
level ought to be.''
   The markets showed little reaction to government reports that
consumer prices rose 0.3 percent and housing construction fell 2.2
percent in December.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.20 Japanese yen, up from
127.90 yen. Late Thursday, in London, the dollar traded lower at
128.75 yen. In New York, the dollar edged up to 128.66 yen from
128.65 yen.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7615 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's $1.7550. Later in New York,
the pound rose to $1.7650 from $1.7535.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, were: 1.8548, down from 1.8721; 1.5775 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5916; 1.1873 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1907; 6.3225
French francs, down from 6.3825; and 1,359.4 Italian lire, down from
1,370.4.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Wednesday's late rates were: 1.8672 West German marks, down from
1.8705; 1.5805 Swiss francs, down from 1.5890; 6.3315 French francs,
down from 6.3800; 2.1060 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0925; 1,368.50
Italian lire, up from 1,356.75; and 1.1890 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1937.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose rose to $403.60 a troy ounce from $402.30 Wednesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $403.83, down from $404.64. In
London, gold closed at $402.50 bid a troy ounce, up from $402.25.
The Zurich closing bid was $403.40 an ounce, up from $402.40.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.97 bid a troy ounce,
up from $5.94. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery rose to $5.976 an ounce from $5.905 Wednesday.

<HEAD>Report Says Investment Group Working With Unions On Bid To Buy Eastern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group that specializes in
employee-led corporate buyouts is poised to bid for troubled Eastern
Airlines, a report published Thursday said.
   The Atlanta Constitution reported that Louis O. Kelso, a San
Francisco lawyer and a leading promoter of employee buyouts, said
the group is almost ready to approach the board of directors of
Texas Air Corp., Eastern's parent.
   The group organized last October as Grandview Acquisition Corp.,
   Among the investors involved in Grandview is former CBS Inc.
President John Backe, the Constitution said.
   A spokeswoman for Kelso reached in New York said no one was
available to comment on the report Thursday.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent declined to comment on the buyout
effort, except to emphasize that Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo
has repeatedly said Eastern is not for sale.
   Eastern union officials also declined to discuss the buyout
effort.
   ``It is very sensitive,'' said Charles E. Bryan, president of the
8,500-member Eastern unit of the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers.
   Kelso reportedly acknowledged that Grandview has yet to arrange
all of the financing needed to buy Miami-based Eastern, which
analysts have speculated could go for between $600 million and $800
million.
   Kelso told the Constitution he does not expect financing to be a
problem, even though Eastern is nearly $2.5 billion in debt, is
losing $1 million a day and has lost what were its two most valuable
assets. Those assets included the System One computer reservation
system, which is now a separate Texas Air subsidiary, and the
Washington-New York-Boston shuttle, which is being sold to developer
Donald J. Trump for $365 million.
   ``I think that Eastern can be structured in a way that it could
be a good opportunity,'' said Kelso, who developed many of the
financing methods now used in employee stock ownership plans, known
as ESOPs.
   The degree of employee ownership envisioned by Grandview and the
concessions that would be required of Eastern's workers has not been
fully determined, said Kelso and others familiar with the effort.
   Eastern's unions have been seeking employee ownership of the
airline for years. Kelso was involved in an unsuccessful ESOP effort
in the months before Texas Air bought Eastern in late 1986.
   Eastern's unions have made no secret of their desire to force
Lorenzo to sell the airline.

<TEXT>
   Richard Darman, George Bush's designated budget
director, told Congress Thursday he would recommend a tax increase
only if the nation faced a crisis so severe that there was no
alternative.
   Darman, at his confirmation hearing, sought to fend off Democrats
probing whether Bush might circumvent his presidential campaign
pledge to seek no new taxes, perhaps by using a different name for
revenue raisers.
   ``I think the president meant no new taxes as it would ordinarily
be understood by ordinary Americans,'' Darman told the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee. ``I think the burden of that is the
duck test _ if it looks lke a duck, it's a duck.''
   But Darman, who said he ``strongly'' believes that Bush ``accepts
the duck test,'' conceded under questioning by Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., that there was an exception to the rule.
   Asked by Levin if such exceptions would include ``a deficit that
threatens our economic health,'' Darman said it would, only if there
was no other way to address the problem.
   But he added, ``I am not now recommending in any way to the
incoming president that he violate the duck test, and I do not now
foresee the circumstances in which I should or would do so.''
   Darman said that in deciding whether to recommend new taxes, he
would also consider the effect such a choice would have on the
president's credibility, which he said is ``extremely important.''
   ``So I would not use exclusively the deficit as a test,'' he said.
   Darman was one of three Bush nominees to go before Congress this
week. Senate panels on Thursday recommended confirmation of two
others, Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III and Labor
Secretary-designate Elizabeth Dole.
   During a break in his hearing, Darman told reporters that he
meant his testimony to give the impression that he was ``closing the
door'' to any new taxes.
   He said he believed that new taxes would ``only be acceptable in
time of war,'' a comment that seemed to contradict his earlier
statements that a severe economic crisis might also trigger new
taxes.
   Darman told the senators that his definition of taxes would
include new levies on gasoline, employee-provided fringe benefits,
putting state and local government workers in a Medicare payroll
deduction program, and eliminating the deduction for interest paid
on home mortgages.
   But he also stated that most people would not consider the
renewal of a tax otherwise due to expire as a new tax. He cited the
3 percent excise tax on local and long-distance telephone service,
which is scheduled to expire at the end of next year but is
considered a likely candidate for renewal.
   And he said he would not consider a new tax to be one that Bush
has ``ever proposed before or even been associated with before.''
   Darman also said he was not sure how long Bush's pledge against
new taxes might last, but added, ``We might as well assume forever.''
   Darman is expected to have little trouble winning Senate
confirmation to the job of director of the Office of Management and
Budget.
   But with the government's $155 billion deficit looming as one of
this year's major political battles, Darman came under questions
from lawmakers about the shape of next year's spending plan.
   Democrats have been trying to pressure Bush into submitting a
detailed budget showing how he would address the improvements to
education, the environment and other programs he promised during the
campaign, yet reduce the deficit without raising taxes. They believe
such a spending plan must include new revenues or spending cuts that
would be unbearably severe.
   Darman said he expected Bush to submit revisions to President
Reagan's $1.15 trillion fiscal 1990 budget by mid-February.
   He also said the Bush administration wants to reach a negotiated
budget that would satisfy Congress and the White House. He sought to
play down earlier reports that the new administration would rather
face the automatic spending cuts required by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit reduction law than raise taxes.
   The Gramm-Rudman law says that if the deficit cannot be reduced
to $100 billion this year, domestic and defense programs must be
slashed until the imbalance reaches that level.
   ``I am not trying in any way to use this as a club,'' he said of
those automatic cuts.
   He also said it was his ``very strong suspicion'' that Bush would
use the same economic assumptions Reagan relied on in his spending
blueprint. Those projections, which include lower interest rates and
higher growth rates than many outside economists expect, would help
the government lower its deficit by increasing the revenues it
collects and decreasing the benefits it must pay out.
   Darman, 55, spent parts of the 1970s and most of the 1980s
working for six Cabinet agencies and the White House. He resigned
from the No. 2 job at the Treasury Department in April 1987 to take
a job with the investment banking division of Shearson Lehman
Brothers, and worked as an adviser to Bush during the presidential
campaign.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the panel's chairman, said he hoped the
committee would finish its hearing and approve Darman's nomination
on Monday. The full Senate could approve the appointment as early as
Wednesday.

<HEAD>GE Unveils Changes At The Top At Kidder, Peabody</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. on Thursday announced a
management shuffle at its Kidder, Peabody Group, the venerable Wall
Street investment house that has provided its share of problems
since GE took control in 1986.
   Installation of new leadership at Kidder reflects the corporate
parent's desire to exert greater control over Kidder's day-to-day
operations, as well as GE's latest attempt to deal with difficulties
posed by the firm, analysts said.
   GE Capital, the company's financial services division stated that
Michael A. Carpenter, an executive vice president of GE Capital, has
been named president and chief executive officer of Kidder, Peabody
Group.
   Silas S. Cathcart, a former GE director brought in as an interim
chief executive in 1987, will stay on as chairman of Kidder.
   Max C. Chapman Jr., a longtime Kidder employee who had been
running the group from his position as president of Kidder, Peabody
&amp; Co., the broker-dealer unit, resigned to pursue other interests,
the statement said.
   While at GE Capital, Carpenter built a reputation as a savvy
manager able to work well within GE's corporate structure.
   Commenting on his appointment, Gary C. Wendt, president of GE
Financial Services, said: ``Mike Carpenter, a creative and talented
thinker himself, has substantial experience in leading the type of
creative and talented people who make up the Kidder organization.''
   Carpenter also will retain responsibility for the corporate
finance group of GE Capital, which specializes in developing
financing packages for leveraged buy-outs. He will continue
reporting to Wendt.
   Once the oldest privately-held firm on Wall Street, Kidder sold
an 80 percent stake in itself to GE in April 1986, boosting Kidder's
capital base and enabling it to compete more effectively with larger
rivals.
   The 124-year-old firm suffered a major blow to its reputation
when it became embroiled in the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal.
Kidder agreed in 1987 to pay a then-record $25.3 million settle
civil charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The episode also prompted GE to make aggressive management
changes at the firm in response to what it perceived as management
weaknesses to led to Kidder's involvement in the scandal.
   The management shakeups at Kidder are seen by many as
highlighting the problems that can occur when smokestack companies
try to bring new types of business into their corporate fold, as has
happened frequently this decade.
   GE management generally has gotten excellent marks for the
handling of its expansion into financial services. But analysts say
some clashes are inevitable even in the most carefully handled
situations.
   While Wall Streeters pride themselves on an entreprenuerial
spirit, they often are criticized for following a strategy that
focuses on short-term rewards at the expense of long-term planning.
   ``It's tough for industrial companies to own Wall Street
financial firms. They drive the creative people out. Creative people
feel limited, suffocated,'' said one analyst, who asked not to be
named. ``It's not like running an insurance company or a bank.''
   Earlier this week, two senior members of Kidder's merchant
banking group announced they were leaving the firm.
   But in response to recent reports indicating GE may be sorry it
bought Kidder, Lawrence A. Bossidy, vice chairman of GE Financial
Services, stated GE was not disappointed with Kidder's 1988 results.
He said Kidder's operating net income came to nearly $50 million in
1988, up about 20 percent over 1987.
   On Thursday, GE reported its net income rose to $1.01 billion in
the fourth quarter, the first time quarterly earnings have exceeded
$1 billion. For all of 1988, GE earned $3.39 billion after taxes, up
16 percent from $2.92 bllion in 1987. The earnings benefited from a
strong showing by GE Financial Services, the largest single GE
business.
   Bossidy also emphatically denied reports that disenchantment with
the profitability of the securities business could induce GE to sell
off Kidder's retail business, which could lead to the dismissal of
2,000 employees.
   Kidder underwent a major restructuring beginning in the wake of
the October 1987 stock market crash _ as did most major Wall Streete
firms _ to consolidate and reduce costs.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Fall In Latest Week</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   NEW YORK _ The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply
declined in the week ended Jan. 9, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell $7.1 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,063.2 billion from a revised $3,070.3 billion
the previous week. The prior week's figure was originally reported
as $3,068.7 billion.
   An even broader measure, M3, decreased $3.9 billion to an
adjusted $3,903.6 billion from $3,907.5, revised from $3,905.0
billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, also declined,
falling $7.7 billion in the latest week to an adjusted $785.4
billion from $793.1 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation,
deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is
M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money- market mutual
funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of
deposit in minimum denominations of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   In other reports:
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $387 million in
the week ended Jan. 11, compared with a gain of $663 million a week
earlier.
   -The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $544 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up $235
million from $309 million a week before.
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $288.5 billion in the two-week period ended Jan. 11, up from
$285.0 billion two weeks earlier.

   Stock prices took a breather Thursday but still
managed a narrow gain, reaching a new high following the October
1987 crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues rose 0.36 to
2,239.11 after picking up 24.11 on Wednesday.
   The widely-followed barometer had a session high of 2,254.64
Thursday _ the first time it has surpassed the level where it stood
before the October 1987 crash.
   On Oct. 16, 1987, the last trading day before the crash, the
average closed at 2,246.74.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 5 to
4 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks
Thursday, with 814 stocks up, 643 down and 528 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 192.03 million
shares, up from 187.54 million in the previous session, and the
highest NYSE volume so far this year.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 226.15 million shares.
   Stock prices began the day strongly, but then gave up much of
their gains to profit-taking.
   Analysts said there were still signs of strength on Wall Street,
and they expected the market's 1989 rally to continue.
   ``I think it's entitled to at least a day or two of flatness,''
said Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. He pointed to
the advance-decline ratio as a indication of the market's underlying
health.
   The Labor Department reported Thursday its consumer price index
rose 0.3 percent in December, bringing the increase in the index for
all of 1988 to 4.4 percent.
   The latest inflation report was lower than most economists had
predicted and contributed to the positive atmosphere on Wall Street.
   However, brokers say the market's strength has not seemed to
derive from economic news, but rather from a gradual easing of the
fears that have persisted ever since the crash.
   Metz noted that the market shrugged off disappointing trade
deficit figures on Wednesday.
   Ron Doran, head of institutional trading at First Albany Corp.
said traders may also be heartened by signs that inflationary
pressures may be lessening.
   Gains by the dollar have helped ease fears that the Federal
Reserve will move interest rates higher, Doran said. When the dollar
advances, foreign goods are cheaper and inflation tends to abate.
   Leading the NYSE's most active list was Lyondell Petroleum, a
spin-off of Atlantic Richfield Corp. that closed at 30{ in its first
day on the Big Board.
   Digital Equipment surged 5\ to 104~ after the company reported
quarterly earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates.
   Polaroid climbed 3[ to 39~. Shamrock Acquisition III Inc. raised
its offer for the company from $42 a share to $45 a share.
   Caterpillar skidded 6| to 61[ after reporting it expected its
1989 earnings to be little changed from last year's profit.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $5.839 billion, or 0.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.24 to 161.25.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index closed up 0.31 at 331.87, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.37 to 286.90.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.20 to 391.08. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 318.56, up 0.34.

<HEAD>Platinum Futures Surge On Technical Factors, Botha Stroke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices surged Thursday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in a technically inspired rally fanned by
concerns about the health of South African President P.W. Botha.
   On other markets, gold and silver futures also gained; orange
juice futures fell sharply; grains and soybeans were broadly mixed;
energy futures were mostly lower; livestock and meat were mixed and
stock-index futures advanced.
   Platinum settled $8.40 a troy ounce to $9.10 an ounce higher with
the contract for delivery in April at $535.70. Platinum for spot
delivery finished at $534.20, a high for the new year.
   Analysts said the buying was triggered mainly by the April
contract's rise above $532.30 an ounce, the highest closing price of
the previous three weeks.
   Platinum prices had been on a gradual upswing for the past week,
but that action was seen primarily as a reaction to recent strong
gains in the palladium market. Palladium is a ``platinum group''
metal _ it shares some characteristics with platinum and is often
found near platinum deposits in nature.
   Platinum managed to ride on palladium's coattails through $532.30
an ounce, at which point it became much more attractive to
speculators, analysts said.
   ``The strength in palladium has spilled over to platinum and now
platinum could become a favorite based on the technicals,'' said
Craig Sloane, a metals-market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co.,
a New York-based brokerage house, said the April contract could rise
as high as $550 an ounce before finding strong resistance.
   ``Technically, the market looks quite strong here,'' he said.
   Cardillo said the platinum rally also reflected fears of
potential supply disruptions from South Africa, the world's largest
platinum producer. Those concerns were sparked by reports that
Botha, leader of the racially divided nation for the last 10 years,
had suffered a mild stroke on Wednesday.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $1.20 to $1.30
higher with February at $404.50 a troy ounce; silver was 6.3 cents
to 6.8 cents higher with March at $6.038 a troy ounce.
   Futures prices for frozen concentrated orange juice dipped
sharply on the New York Cotton Exchange on expectations for a large
Florida orange crop.
   ``At this point, we're past the critical freeze period,'' said
Judith Ganes of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``There's an expectation
that prices will have to come down to stimulate demand.''
   Orange juice settled 2.45 cents to 4.65 cents lower with March at
$1.455 a pound.
   Wheat futures moved moderately higher on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid mounting concerns about dry weather in winter-wheat
growing areas, while corn and soybean prices finished mostly lower.
   Analysts said the rally in the wheat market was fanned by
Wednesday's 6-to-10-day outlook from the National Weather Service,
which predicted continued drier-than-normal conditions from Texas to
Nebraska.
   ``I think we'll continue to extend upward until some
precipitation is perceived there,'' said Richard Feltes, director of
commodity research with Refco Inc., a large, Chicago-based futures
brokerage firm.
   Liquidation of corn and soybean futures resumed in a continuing
reaction to the USDA's report of larger-than-expected supplies of
those commodities. Contracts for delivery of soybeans from the 1989
crop advanced as traders sold contracts for near-term delivery and
bought the new-crop contracts.
   Wheat settled 2\ cents to 3} cents higher with March at $4.42} a
bushel; corn was 1} cents to 3\ cents lower with March at $2.67} a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3} cents lower with March at $2.34 a
bushel; soybeans were 9} cents lower to 4{ cents higher with January
at $7.53 a bushel.
   Oil futures were mostly lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange
following the previous session's robust advance.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 56 cents lower to 2
cents higher with February at $19.28 a barrel; heating oil was .65
cent to 1.04 cents lower with February at 53.75 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .64 cent lower to .04 cent higher with
February at 52.10 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed in a partial recovery
from the previous day's steep losses.
   Live cattle were .32 cent lower to .18 cent higher with February
at 73 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .30 cent lower
with January at 84.37 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower
to .32 cent higher with February at 43.92 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .02 cent to .40 cent lower with February at 40.20 cents
a pound.
   Stock-index futures gained modestly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of stocks
represented by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled .55 point
higher at 289.25. The contract is worth $500 a point.

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state treasury has canceled a $110
million commitment to the company acquiring RJR Nabisco Inc. because
of Michigan's new law banning investments in business with ties to
South Africa.
   Foes of South Africa's race-segregation system said Thursday they
welcomed the decision a day earlier by State Treasurer Robert Bowman
to scrap the investment in a fund run by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co., the firm buying RJR in a takeover valued at a record $24.53
billion.
   ``I think it's a courageous decision in line with the spirit of
the legislation,'' said state Rep. Perry Bullard, one of the
sponsors of the measure banning South African-related investments.
   RJR, a food-and-tobacco giant with products ranging from Oreo
cookies to Salem cigarettes, agreed to sell itself to Kohlberg late
last year.
   Based in Atlanta, RJR is one of 95 U.S. companies with South
African involvement, according to a list Bowman compiled in
compliance with the law which took effect Jan. 1.
   The measure bans new investments of state pension funds in
companies involved in South Africa until that white-ruled nation
drops its policy of racial segregation known as apartheid or until
the companies sever their ties with the country.
   It also requires the $16 billion pension fund to sell off over
the next five years the $5 billion in investments it holds in South
African-involved companies.
   Bullard and state Sen. Virgil Smith, D-Detroit, another sponsor
of the divestiture measure, said they had talked privately to Bowman
and argued against the Kohlberg investment.
   ``My reaction is a positive one,'' Smith said. ``He did what I
wanted him to do.''
   Bowman's decision makes Michigan the second state to back out of
participating in Kohlberg's fund for the acquisition of RJR.
Massachusetts withdrew earlier.
   Kohlberg officials referred inquiries to its public relations
company, Kekst and Co., in New York, but officials there didn't
return three telephone calls seeking reaction to the Michigan
decision.
   The apartheid foes' praise of Bowman was in contrast to the
criticism they heaped on the treasurer when he decided to invest
$335 million in South African-involved companies shortly before the
divestiture law took effect Jan. 1.
   Treasury spokesman Robert Kolt said the two situations were
different because the state had completed those purchases before the
investment ban took effect.
   ``We haven't actually released the money yet (to Kohlberg), which
would take place after the law took effect so that's the problem,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   A one-month record of $7.01 billion in deposits
flowed out of the nation's savings institutions in November as
increases in interest paid on deposits lagged behind the market, the
government said Thursday.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates about 3,000
federally insured S&amp;Ls, said it was the seventh consecutive month of
net withdrawals, which from May through November totaled $16.4
billion.
   In the seven months from October 1987 through last April, $28.1
billion in new deposits had flowed into S&amp;Ls as investors fleeing
stock market turmoil sought the safety of federally-insured accounts.
   James Barth, chief economist at the bank board, attributed
November's deposit drain to the fact that S&amp;Ls, on average,
increased the rates offered on one-year certificates of deposit by
only 0.13 percentage points.
   That compares with gains of about 0.20 percentage points on
commercial bank deposits and mutual funds and 0.53 percentage points
on U.S. Treasury bills, he said.
   Barth said the lag in rates paid on S&amp;L deposits indicated
thrifts, at least in November, have been able to resist market
pressures driving up their cost of doing business.
   Many analysts have been worried about how well the industry would
be able to cope with rising interest rates.
   However, James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of
Saving Institutions, said the big deposit drain was worrisome. He
said mortgage rates have also lagged other kinds of interest rates
and speculated that S&amp;Ls are taking in fewer deposits because
they're having a harder time making a profit on mortgage lending.
   ``There's been a significant cost squeeze ... so some managers
may be saying, `Why take it in if I can't make a profit on it,'''
Christian said.
   ``I do not read this at all as a situation where the industry is
having trouble attracting deposits,'' said economist Martin Regalia
of the National Council of Savings Institutions. ``... I read this
as a situation where wise institutions are backing away.'
   He added, ``Some of the money that came out of the stock market
is going to go back into the market now that it is doing better.''
   One of regulators' goals in the recent spate of S&amp;L closings,
particularly in Texas, has been to reduce the number of unhealthy
institutions paying high interest rates on deposits because that in
turn had driven up the cost of funds for all S&amp;Ls.
   Barth said in November a California S&amp;L allowed a deposit runoff
of $1 billion at a New Jersey institution it acquired in a
government-assisted deal. He was apparently referring to First
Nationwide of San Francisco's purchase of Lincoln Federal Savings
and Loan Association of Westfield, N.J.
   Also, in line with regulators' plans, 10 thrifts in the Southwest
had $1.7 billion in deposits flow out, he said.

<HEAD>Caterpillar's Profit Down 4.1 Percent in Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Earth-moving giant Caterpillar Inc. on
Thursday reported that its profit slipped 4.1 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1988, while soaring to record levels for the year as a
whole.
   Caterpillar's fourth-quarter earnings declined to $163 million,
or $1.61 a share, from $170 million, or $1.67 a share, in the
year-earlier quarter.
   The decline occurred despite an increase in revenue for the
quarter to $2.66 billion from $2.24 billion.
   For the 1988 fiscal year, the company said it posted the highest
sales and profit in its history, boosted by surging demand for farm
equipment.
   Annual earnings jumped 76 percent, to $616 million from $350
million the year before.
   Revenue for the year increased to $10.43 billion from $8.18
billion.
   ``The only appropriate word to describe 1988 financial results is
excellent,'' said Len Kuchan, company treasurer. ``We're very
pleased to have a record year but ... we're not popping any
champagne. We're too busy working on 1989.''
   If there's no celebration, it's due to the memory of the
company's disastrous performance after its 1981 triumph.
Caterpillar's market collapsed due to overcapacity in the industry
and fierce competition at home and abroad, and a strong dollar
further weakened its ability to compete overseas.
   A strict cost-cutting program _ including plant closings and
18,000 layoffs in the Peoria area _ helped Caterpillar survive $950
million in losses and serious labor turmoil over the next three
years.
   ``Vigilance is the word of the day. Our competition is still very
strong,'' Kuchan said.
   He attributed Caterpillar's strong 1988 performance to a huge
surge in demand for its equipment.
   ``We were running sales volumes last year that were not
anticipated until 1991,'' Kuchan said. ``We were not expecting the
kind of sales strength we experienced that evolved in every major
sales category and in every region of the world. The demand was
universal, especially on the replacement market.''
   Kuchan said Caterpillar officials were aware that much of the
company's equipment in the field was aging and in need of
replacement but never expected the demand that developed.
   Kuchan said the company remains guarded about its profits outlook
despite forecasting that 1989 would bring another record in sales.
He said earnings likely will only match the 1988 record performance
and not grow significantly, due to increasing costs in numerous
areas.
   ``Our costs are still too high. We're still not happy with the
return on shareholders' investments,'' he said. ``But 1989 still
will be a good year.''
   Caterpillar sales in the United States were $5.07 billion in
1988, an increase of 18 percent from 1987.
   Foreign sales accounted for $5.18 billion of Caterpillar's
business last year, or about 33 percent over the 1987 level.
   Caterpillar's worldwide workforce stood at 60,558 at the end of
the fourth quarter, an increase of 6,095 over employment levels for
the year-earlier period.

   Time Inc., the subject of recent takeover
speculation, said Thursday it had extended its stock repurchase
program and amended its shareholder rights plan.
   Time said its board approved the buyback of a total 20 million
shares, up from the 10 million approved in 1986. So far, the
publishing and entertainment company said, it has bought back 8.1
million shares under the program.
   There are currently 56.7 million shares outstanding.
   Time stock rose sharply after Thursday's announcement, closing at
$110.37{ a share, up $2.37{, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.
   The board also approved amendments to the shareholder rights plan
that would make it more difficult to mount a hostile takeover of the
firm. Among the changes approved was a lower percentage required to
trigger some of the plan's provisions.
   Time and other publishing concerns have been named from time to
time as possible takeover targets. Time said Thursday it was not
aware of any attempt to take over the firm.

<HEAD>Long-Promised Superseding Indictment Returned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury returned a long-promised
superseding indictment of Princeton-Newport Partners officials
Thursday, adding 33 more counts _ but no new defendants _ to the
previous racketeering and fraud charges.
   Five partners in the securities firm and a former official of the
investment banking giant Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. were charged in
August with racketeering, conspiracy, mail and wire fraud for an
alleged tax scam.
   The case marked the first time federal racketeering laws were
used against officials of a securities firm. No charges were leveled
against the firm itself, which was headquartered in Princeton, N.J.,
and Newport Beach, Calif.
   Drexel has since reached an agreement with prosecutors to plead
guilty to six felony counts and pay a record $650 million in fines
and penalties.
   Princeton-Newport announced it was liquidating last month,
blaming the indictment as well as the publicly-promised _ but
long-delayed _ superseding indictment for spooking many of the
firm's investors into withdrawing their capital.
   A week after the original August indictment, which accused the
six defendants of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy to create
illegal tax losses through phony stock deals, it was disclosed that
prosecutors planned an updated indictment, which could include new
charges of defendants.
   But the government pushed the date back to November and then
January without disclosing details. In October the partners posted a
$14 million bond because alleged illegal profits are subject to
seizure upon conviction under the federal racketeering laws.
   No new defendants were added by the superseding indictment.
   Specifically, the new indictment charged that the six engaged in
additional acts of racketeering, mail and wire fraud; committed
securities fraud in connection with public offerings by Drexel and
previously uncharged tax law violations.
   The defendants were identified as: James Sutton Reagan, 46, of
Pennington, N.J., one of Princeton-Newport's two managing general
partners; Jack Z. Rabinowitz, 42, head of the firm's financial and
accounting operations; Charles M. Zarezcki, 40, Princeton-Newport's
chief trader; and Paul A. Berkman, 42, chief trader for a
Princeton-Newport subsidiary. Rabinowitz, Zarezcki and Berkman all
are from Princeton, N.J.
   Also: Princeton-Newport's comptroller, Steven B. Smotrich, 33, of
Belle Meade, N.J.; and Bruce Lee Newberg, 31, who worked in Drexel's
high-yield bond department, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., until
early 1988.
   All six previously were charged with one count each of
racketeering and conspiracy for alleged schemes to create bogus tax
gains and losses through sham securities sales between
Princeton-Newport and Drexel, and other phony sales from Drexel to
Princeton-Newport, to avoid regulatory requirements and stock
manipulation.
   All were charged additionally with numerous counts of signing or
aiding and abetting false tax returns for the partnership in
1984-1986.
   All six face maximum penalties of 20 years in prison and $250,000
in fines if convicted of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy,
the most serious charges.

<HEAD>GE Earnings Up 16 Percent in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co., citing strong gains
in productivity, on Thursday announced net earnings for 1988 of
$3.38 billion, up 16 percent from the $2.91 billion it earned a year
earlier.
   Earnings per share were $3.75, up from $3.20 in 1987.
   Revenue for 1988 was $38.82 billion, 1 percent less than a year
earlier.
   Earnings for the fourth quarter of 1988 were about $1.01 billion.
It was the first quarter in which GE's reported earnings exceeded $1
billion, and was 16 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Fourth-quarter revenue was $12.30 billion, 2 percent more than
the $12.03 billion in 1987's final quarter.
   ``The year 1988 was an excellent one and the pace has not slowed
as we have entered 1989,'' GE Chairman John F. Welch Jr. said.
``This was GE's second consecutive year of strong double-digit
earnings growth. Most businesses contributed to the better earnings,
with productivity gains a pervasive factor.''
   GE said it registered gains in earnings and sales in its
plastics, medical systems and broadcasting segments, tempering
reductions in major appliances earnings.
   The decreases were attributed to significantly higher warranty
expenses for some refrigerator compressors.

<TEXT>
   Canadian Airlines International announced plans
Thursday to buy rival Wardair, the airline that began more than 30
years ago with a single aircraft and became Canada's third-largest
carrier.
   Max Ward, the former bush pilot who founded the airline,
confirmed the proposed sale, saying Wardair simply ran out of money
in its bid to grow from a charter service to a regularly scheduled
airline.
   Under terms of the deal, Canadian Airlines parent Pacific Western
Airlines Corp. will pay 17.25 Canadian dollars for each Wardair
share. Canadian Airlines is currently the country's No. 2 airline
after Air Canada.
   With about 14.4 million Wardair shares outstanding, CAI's offer
is worth around 248 million Canadian dollars.
   Ward said the buyout would leave Wardair intact and operating
under the same name, but will mean job losses for one-third of the
company's 4,500 employees.
   ``We just didn't have enough money to hold out for another year
in order to turn Wardair into another scheduled carrier,'' Ward told
a news conference. ``It's the end of an era.''
   Ward, who owns 30 percent of his company's stock, has agreed to
sell his entire block. He will stay on as Wardair chairman.
   Jack Lawless, a spokesman for CAI, stressed that the deal was not
a merger. ``We intend to keep operating these two airlines
separately,'' he said from Calgary. ``Each has its own strengths.''
   Consumers shouldn't see any difference in services, other than
some coordinating of schedules, he said.

<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raytheon Co. on Thursday reported an 8
percent boost in its fourth-quarter earnings, which it attributed to
increased sales and lower U.S. taxes.
   The electronics giant said its earnings in the quarter ended Dec.
31 rose to $127.3 million, or $1.92 a share, from $117.9 million, or
$1.69 a share, in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 3.4 percent, to $2.21 billion from
$2.14 billion.
   Rising profits reflected increased sales with higher operating
income and a lower federal income tax rate, Raytheon said. Earnings
per share were boosted further because there were fewer shares
outstanding, the company said.
   Much of the sales increase occurred in Raytheon's electronics
division, which accounted for 61 percent of sales in 1988, compared
with 61.9 percent in 1987. Leading electronics sales was the Missile
Systems Division, the company said.
   For all of 1988, earnings increased 10 percent _ to $489.6
million, or $7.35 a share, from $445.1 million, or $6.12 a share, in
1987.
   Revenue for 1988 rose 7 percent, to $8.19 billion from $7.66
billion the year before.
   Raytheon's earnings per share were based on the average number of
shares outstanding during the period. In 1988, the average shares
outstanding came to 66.6 million, down from 72.8 million the year
before.
   In the fourth quarter, there was an average of 66.3 million
shares outstanding; in that period in 1987 the average was 70
million shares.
   Raytheon employs 76,200 people worldwide, including 31,000 in
Massachusetts.

   Japan is considering an invitation from the U.S.
Treasury Department to attend a meeting of top economic officials of
the Group of Seven industrial nations in Washington on Feb. 3, a
Foreign Ministry official said Friday.
   But Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama said the timing of the
meeting could cause scheduling problems for Japan.
   ``From the Finance Ministry's point of view there are tax matters
to be considered. Let me just say there will be problems. A
blockage,'' Murayama said.
   Murayama was referring to Parliamentary debate on Japan's budget
for the next fiscal year. Budget negotiations officially began
Thursday and are expected to continue until early next month, about
the same time as the prospective G7 conference.
   The G7 meetings discuss currency stability and other
international economic issues.
   ``Finance Ministry officials say they have received an invitation
for a G7 meeting in Washington on Feb. 3, but they haven't decided
on their response,'' said the Foreign Ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   In his comments to reporters, Murayama refused to say if he would
be able to attend the meeting.
   ``It's a touchy issue so we can't provide any details now,'' said
a Finance Ministry official, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   If the meeting takes place, it will be the first for Murayama,
who replaced former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa after he
resigned due to his alleged involvement in a major scandal involving
questionable purchases of stock.
   The G7 groups the United States, Britain, France, West Germany,
Japan, Canada and Italy.
