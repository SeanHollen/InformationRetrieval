<HEAD>Yacht That Took Gary Hart On Famous Cruise Suffered From Fame</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monkey Business, the yacht that helped sink Gary
Hart's presidential aspirations in 1988, is for sale, and its
captain says notoriety from Hart's trip to Bimini with Donna Rice
hurt business.
   The charter boat, which is docked at Turberry Marina in Miami,
is on sale for $1.5 million, Capt. Butch Vogelsang said in a report
published Sunday in The Denver Post.
   The 83-foot yacht briefly became a household name in 1987, when
Miami model Donna Rice was photographed sitting on Democratic
presidential candidate Hart's lap during a cruise to Bimini.
   The photograph surfaced after published reports that Hart and
Rice spent a night together at the candidate's Washington, D.C.,
townhouse. The revelations forced Hart to withdraw from the
presidential race.
   Vogelsang said he remembers the trip to Bimini with Hart and
Rice.
   ``I'll tell you what happened. Nothing,'' he said. ``Hart didn't
do anything with the girls. A captain knows what goes on on the
ship. I can tell you this. The beds weren't touching. If anything,
Hart acted so naive. He just kind of stood around. He wasn't a
boatsman.''
   But the stories about that famous cruise nearly ruined the
Monkey Business, Vogelsang said.
   ``We were dead after the publicity,'' he said. ``We mostly
charter out for a week at a time, and anybody who spends $25,000
doesn't want people staring and saying, `Oh, there goes the Monkey
Business. Where's Gary?' They want privacy.''
   Since then, business has steadily improved, he said. ``We're
doing about 40 charters a year now.''

   Joseph Lelyveld has been named managing editor
of The New York Times, replacing Arthur Gelb, who is retiring, the
newspaper announced Saturday.
   Lelyveld was promoted from foreign editor to deputy managing
editor in July in anticipation of succeeding Gelb.
   Gelb, 65, will retire Sunday and become executive vice president
of The New York Times Company Foundation, according to the
announcement by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman of the Times
Company and publisher of the newspaper.
   As managing editor, Lelyveld, 52, will be the main deputy to the
newspaper's executive editor, Max Frankel.
   Lelyveld started at the newspaper in 1962 as a copy boy and has
reported from New York, Washington, the Congo, India, Hong Kong,
Britain and South Africa. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1986 for his
book about South Africa, ``Move Your Shadow.''
   A graduate of Harvard University and the Columbia Graduate
School of Journalism, Lelyveld has been a national correspondent
for The Times Magazine and deputy foreign editor from 1977 to 1980.
He became foreign editor in December 1986.
   Gelb worked 45 years at the Times, including as a reporter,
critic, news editor and metropolitan editor.
   As a theater critic, he was among the first to recognize talents
such as Barbra Streisand, Colleen Dewhurst, Woody Allen, Lenny
Bruce and Dick Gregory.
   In his new position, Gelb will work with the foundation's
president, Fred M. Hechinger, and will succeed Hechinger when he
retires in September. The foundation supports charitable,
educational, cultural, journalistic and environmental programs.
   The Times also announced that Carolyn Lee, 44, was appointed an
assistant managing editor. She will succeed Warren Hoge as
administrator of the 1,000-member news staff, with responsibility
for personnel and business affairs.
   Hoge, also an assistant managing editor, will supervise news and
feature coverage.

<HEAD>China Blasts Britain Over Right Of Abode Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Saturday said a British plan to give
special residence rights to 50,000 Hong Kong families was a ``gross
violation'' of Sino-British agreements on the return of Hong Kong
to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
   The Foreign Ministry said in a statement it was ``greatly
surprised'' at the British plan and threatened to take unspecified
retaliatory action.
   Britain on Dec. 20 announced it will give residence rights to
50,000 households, about 225,000 Hong Kong Chinese, to help prevent
a brain drain of the colony's most talented people before 1997.
   The British government has argued that guarantees of right of
abode will ease concerns about Chinese rule after 1997 and will
encourage people to remain in Hong Kong.
   An estimated 42,000 people, many frightened by China's bloody
suppression of the pro-democracy movement this spring, have
emigrated this year, and 55,000 are expected to leave in 1990.
   The Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the official Xinhua
News Agency, said the British plan ``is a gross violation of
(Britain's) own solemn commitment'' made in 1984 when the two
countries agreed on the reversion of Hong Kong.
   It quoted a 1984 memorandum stating that Hong Kong citizens with
British passports can use the passports after July 1, 1997
``without conferring the right of abode in the United Kingdom.''
   Some 3.25 million Hong Kong Chinese in the territory of 6
million people now have British passports but no residence rights.
   The Foreign Ministry demanded that Britain reverse its position
on residence rights. ``Otherwise, it will have to bear a series of
consequences arising therefrom. The Chinese side reserves the right
to take corresponding measures thereby.''
   It was not clear why it took the Chinese side 10 days to respond
to the British proposal.

<TEXT>
   A chain of collisions on an icy,
fogbound interstate outside Flagstaff left six people dead and at
least 34 injured Saturday, authorities said.
   Another series of collisions on a foggy stretch of interstate in
northern Florida injured 15 people, one seriously.
   The mid-morning accidents in Arizona involved about 40 vehicles,
including 16 to 18 tractor trailers, said Sgt. Allan Schmidt, a
spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety.
   There were at least three separate accident sites over a
quarter-mile stretch of Interstate 40 about five miles east of
Flagstaff in northern Arizona, officials said.
   Emergency personnel and equipment were brought in from as far
away as Kingman, 160 miles to the west.
   ``This is the all-time worst accident that I've ever personally
witnessed,'' said Coconino County Sheriff Joe Richards, a 17-year
veteran.
   ``The extensive amount of injuries, damage and death, it's
almost unbelieveable. It's nightmarish in its magnitude.''
   Schmidt initially said six people were confirmed dead, but
Flagstaff Fire Capt. Paul Hellenberg revised that figure downward
to five, including three people whose bodies were pulled from a car
trapped between three tractor-trailer rigs.
   Then an unidentified 14-year-old girl who was freed from the
same car after more than five hours died of her injuries in a
hospital, bringing the toll back up to six, Hellenberg said.
   Thirty-three other people were taken to Flagstaff Medical Center
with injuries, hospital spokeswoman Lauren Bosse said. Ten people
were treated and released, she said. Bosse said she did not know
the conditions or injuries of the others.
   At least six people were injured seriously, Fire Capt. Mike
Giovando said.
   The accidents closed the eastbound lanes of I-40, heading toward
Albuquerque, N.M., for the day. Westbound lanes were reopened a
couple of hours after the accidents.
   Traffic was backed up for several miles and had to be rerouted.
   Officials said they were investigating the cause.
   Giovando, one of the first authorities on the scene, said the
accidents apparently were the result of icy roads and fog. Up to 2
feet of snow has fallen in Flagstaff since Thursday night.
   ``It was a real heavy fog,'' Giovando said. ``We were trying to
get a hose line, then we heard people screaming that they were
being burned by the fire.''
   One truck was destroyed by fire, officials said.
   A shelter for survivors was set up at a local elementary school.
   In Florida, four chain-reaction collisions involving 25 vehicles
closed Interstate 95 for more than two hours in both directions
just south of the Georgia border, the Florida Highway Patrol said.
   Nine people were taken to hospitals, including a 5-year-old boy
who was in serious condition in the pediatric intensive care unit
of Baptist Hospital in Jacksonville, nurse Bonnie Lundblom said.
   The boy's younger brother, believed to be about 18 months old,
was in stable condition and ``doing fine,'' Lundblom said.
   Trooper Charlie Creel said the two boys were flown to
Jacksonville by helicopter.

   The 28-member crew of a Greek freighter
foundering 800 miles northeast of Hawaii fled to the safety of a
Coast Guard vessel Saturday, authorities said.
   The Vulca, with a load of scrap metal bound for South Korea from
Los Angeles, was in danger of sinking with water flooding into its
forward holds. The cause of the flooding has not been determined.
   A Coast Guard plane dropped five water pumps to the 600-foot
freighter on Friday after the ship radioed a distress call, but
none of the pumps were working by Saturday evening because seawater
continued flowing into the holds, Chief Petty Officer Dennis
Hubbard said.
   If the water was contained to just the two forward holds, the
Vulca had a chance of remaining afloat until a commercial salvage
ship arrived Monday to tow it to Honolulu, Hubbard said.
   The Coast Guard cutter Sassafras, which arrived on scene earlier
Saturday, tried to tow the Vulca out of the wind which was blowing
the water over the bow, but the effort failed, Hubbard said.
   The Sassafras, which replaced a commercial tanker that had come
to the Vulca's aid, was to stand by the abandoned freighter until
it sank or the salvage ship arrived, he said.
   The Coast Guard previously had erroneously identified the ship
as the Bulka.

<HEAD>Bush Says It's To Soon to Reduce Troops in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he's looking forward to ``an
opportunity to shake hands'' with U.S. servicemen wounded in
Panama, but that it's too early to make sharp reductions in U.S.
troops there.
   ``We don't want to act too precipitously,'' the president said
Saturday as he continued to enjoy a year-end vacation in his
adopted home state of Texas.
   Bush was travelling Sunday to San Antonio, where he was to visit
two military hospitals _ the Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center
and Brooke Army Medical Center.
   Nearly all the more than 320 U.S. serviceman wounded in the
fighting in Panama were treated at the two hospitals, although most
have since been released. Fewer than 60 were expected to still be
there for Bush's visit.
   ``I would like to, at year-end here, salute them once again for
what they've done, and I will have an opportunity to shake hands
with some of those kids,'' Bush said.
   Speaking with reporters as he finished a game of golf at the
Houston Country Club on Saturday, Bush sought to minimize the
stalemate with the Vatican over the fate of deposed Panamanian
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega has been holed up in the Vatican embassy in Panama City
since Christmas Eve. The Roman Catholic Church has balked at U.S.
demands to turn him over to the United States to stand trial in
Florida on drug-trafficking charges.
   ``I think it's time to cool it on both sides and let the
diplomatic process bring this matter to a happy resolution,'' Bush
said.
   The president said he had no quarrel with the Vatican, and might
even call Pope John II if he thinks such contact is needed to
reduce tensions.
   At the same time, Bush said the Vatican has ``a history of
giving asylum to people who are fleeing, even thugs like Noriega.''
   Bush also conceded that a U.S. raid on the residence of the
Nicaraguan ambassador in Panama City was a ``screw-up'' and
shouldn't have happened.
   But while apologizing to Nicaragua for the intrusion, Bush noted
the large arsenal of weapons uncovered inside.
   ``I would like to know what the man's doing with rocket
launchers and grenades and uzis and automatic weapons up to his
eyeballs in his house,'' Bush said. ``It makes you wonder exactly
what our young men are up against down there.''
   Bush said that while he had no immediate plans to pull out any
of the some 26,000 U.S. troops now in Panama, he hoped to bring
some of them home ``very soon.''
   ``I think the sooner we can have our troops that went down there
out, the better it will be,'' Bush said.

   An America West jetliner skidded off the
end of the runway at Tucson International Airport on Saturday
night, and three of 127 people aboard were hurt, authorities said.
   The Boeing 737, Flight 450 from Phoenix, apparently lost
hydraulic pressure while landing at 7:05 p.m. (9:05 p.m. EST),
airport spokeswoman Paula Morgan said.
   The plane carried 122 passengers and a crew of five, said Dick
Shimizu, an America West spokesman at company headquarters in Tempe.
   One passenger complained of chest pains after the landing and
two complained of neck injuries, Ms. Morgan said. They were taken
to hospitals. Shimizu said nobody who was injured was hospitalized
overnight.
   The airliner ended up nose down about 100 yards west of the
airport perimeter fence after the nose gear collapsed, Ms. Morgan
said.
   Passengers were removed from the plane through emergency chutes
on the side. Emergency equipment was rushed to the scene.
   Bill Kuhn, 19, of Tucson, who was at the airport waiting for a
friend from Tennessee and watched the landing, said: ``The plane
just flew down the runway, it wasn't stopping. I immediately knew
something was wrong.''
   He said airport officials told relatives and friends that the
plane suffered an hydraulic leak and that the tires blew, causing
it to go off the runway. Ms. Morgan also said the rough landing was
related to an hydraulic leak.

   Gunmen believed to be Moslem
bandits kidnapped a French missionary and his niece in the southern
Philippines, and police killed one of the abductors in a firefight,
police and church officials said Sunday.
   The Rev. Michel de Gigord and his 29-year-old niece, Benedict,
were abducted Saturday after leaving Saint Mary's Convent in
Marawi, 510 miles southeast of Manila. said the Rev. Leo Laviste,
Vicar General of Archdiocese of Iligan and Marawi cities.
   Laviste said they have not yet heard from the kidnappers.
   Laviste said de Gigord, was driving his niece toward Iligan
City, 20 miles to the north, when six armed men stopped their car
near the convent's gate.
   One of the gunmen shoved de Gigord from the driver's seat and,
followed by a jeep boarded by the other kidnappers, drove the
priest's car to the shores of nearby Lanao Lake and sent the two
victims by boat to an island in the lake, Laviste said.
   Neighbors who saw the abduction immediately informed authorities
in the convent who notified the local police.
   Pursuing policemen engaged in a gunbattle with some of the
gunmen who had been left behind on the lakeshore, killing one of
them, Marawi police station commander Capt. Jalandoni Cota. He said
the others escaped.
   Police also recovered de Gigord's vehicle, abandoned by the
kidnappers. There was no report on what happened to the kidnapper's
jeep.
   Sources at the Lanao del Sur provincial military and police
headquarters said the victims have been moved by the kidnappers to
the town of Madamba, 23 miles west of Marawi, late Sunday morning.
   Provincial commander Lt. Col. Omar Manabilang has sought the
assistance of the mayors of Madamba and two adjacent towns and
local Moslem religious leaders to help rescue the priest and his
niece, the sources said.
   De Gigord, a member of the Paris Foreign Mission, has been
chaplain at the Mindanao State University in Marawi for the past 10
years. He was kidnapped by Moslem bandits in February 1985 and held
captive for about a month in their mountain hideout but was
released unharmed.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers hissed, jeered, shouted and
yelled Sunday during the long-awaited testimony of disgraced former
president Chun Doo-hwan as he testified in Parliament after 13
months in self-imposed exile.
   ``Is killing innocent people an exercise in self-defense?''
yelled opposition lawmakers when Chun denied involvement in a 1980
civil uprising.
   Kim Young-bae, a national opposition legislator, marched to a
microphone and said for hundreds of thousands to hear on
television, ``The contents of his testimony and attitude are
incurring the wrath of the people.''
   Kim Dae-jung, a two-time presidential candidate and opposition
party leader who was sentenced to death under Chun's rule for
alleged sedition, was among 200 legislators and spectators at the
National Assembly.
   President Roh Tae-woo appealed to citizens in a New Year's
message Sunday ``to put an end to past affairs once the past
president apologizes for wrong-doings.''
   But by mid-afternoon, newspapers and television stations said
they were flooded with calls protesting Chun's testimony as
disappointing and angry that he had not apologized. The committee
chairman said political party offices also had been deluged by
angry telephone callers.
   Chun returned to Seoul from a remote Buddhist temple early
Sunday to testify on alleged corruption, human rights abuses and
misconduct during his seven years in office that ended in early
1988.
   There have been widespread public demands to make the truth
known about alleged misdeeds of Chun's authoritarian rule to clear
the way for more open government and more democratic reform.
   Thousands of riot police were deployed around the Parliament
building and in nearby streets to prevent attacks by radicals and
students who have staged violent demonstrations demanding Chun be
arrested and punished, but there were no clashes.
   Chun, a former general, took power with military backing in
1980. He has denied any personal corruption but 48 of his friends
and relatives have been tried and convicted of embezzlement and
other crimes.
   The 58-year-old Chun, looking somber, occasionally biting his
tongue and growing more weary as the hearings went on into the
night, said ``the president of a nation is bound to take unlimited
responsibility for the state of affairs during his tenure.''
   Chun did not make an outright apology, as some politicans have
demanded, but said he would take ``moral responsibility'' for
misdeeds under his administration. ``I didn't do anything wrong,''
Chun said.
   Legislators were outraged when Chun said he had not been
involved in the uprising which left 200 dead and at least 1,500
people injured in the southern city of Kwangju. Chun said he was
out of line of command.
   ``Marshall law authorities at that time gave troops on the scene
the discretion to open fire if they faced a war situation,'' he
said.
   ``Testify! Testify!'' lawmakers shouted.
   Some opposition leaders believe the Kwangju incident was a
scheme by Chun and his associates to seize power in the chaotic
days that followed the assassination of President Park Chung-hee in
late 1979.

bloc, was certain to trigger a crisis in the shaky governing
coalition formed after inconclusive elections in November 1988.
   According to the coalition agreement, the premier cannot remove
a Labor minister without the consent of Vice Premier Shimon Peres,
the Labor leader.
   Transport Minister Moshe Katsav of Shamir's Likud Bloc said on
Israel radio that Shamir made the announcement during the weekly
Cabinet session.
   ``The prime minister announced his intention to fire Minister
Weizman, because Weizman conducted direct and indirect meetings
with the PLO, which is against the laws of the state of Israel,''
said Katzav.
   Also Sunday, peace activists accused police of brutality and
overreaction in breaking up a demonstration by 15,000 Palestinians,
Israelis and Europeans.
   Police said they were provoked by stones, bottles and outlawed
PLO flags. Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said that in Saturday's
rally 45 arrests were made and 25 people were injured by rubber
bullets and tear gas, including an Italian woman who lost her eye
after a water canon was used. Organizers estimated 50 people were
injured.
   Israeli, Palestinian and European demonstrators joined hands to
form a human chain around the Old Walled City of Jerusalem under
the theme, ``1990- Time for Peace.''
   Sandori said several police were hit by the stones and bottles.
   Four Associated Press reporters stationed along the old city
walls said they heard pro-Palestinian slogans shouted but did not
see any stones thrown or PLO flags waved. The independent Israeli
daily Yediot Ahronot said stones were thrown but only after police
opened up with a water canon.
   Peace Now leaders demanded an official inquiry into the
shootings, claiming police had overreacted and used excessive
force, instigating much of the Palestinian violence in the largely
peaceful three-hour rally.
   The Cabinet and Parliament's Internal Affairs Committee debated
the issue Sunday.

   Three rubles will buy a cab ride in Nome as
part of a fledgling Chamber of Commerce project to let Soviets
spend their currency here.
   Jim Stimpfle of the chamber's Committee for Cooperation,
Commerce and Peace said last week the project is a way to give the
non-convertible ruble some value in the United States.
   He said he hopes that eventually acceptance of rubles in Nome
will snowball into the ruble becoming officially convertible into
dollars at a reasonable rate of exchange.
   ``It's good will, it's friendship, it's solidarity,'' Stimpfle
said.
   The ruble project grows from the opening of travel between
Alaska and the Soviet Far East during the last two years.
   Stimpfle said there were 85 flights between Nome and the Soviet
port town of Provideniya in 1989. During the summer an average of
10 Soviets a week were in Nome, either for a visit or passing
through, he said.
   Most Soviets arrive with $40 from their sponsoring organizations
in the Soviet Union, he said.
   Their government prohibits them from taking rubles from home,
but many do so anyway and make black-market swaps for dollars with
Alaskans planning trips to Provideniya.
   Stimpfle said $1 in the Soviet Union here officially brings six
rubles. In Nome, under-the-table rates for rubles vary. Under the
chamber's plan, businesses are encouraged to establish their own
rates of exchange.
   Checker Cab, which charges $3 for a ride in Nome, has agreed to
take Soviet passengers for three rubles, and Stimpfle said at least
two other businesses are willing to consider rubles.
   He's ordered stickers that say, in Russian, ``Rubles Accepted
Here'' and will distribute them to participating companies.

   A man who said small planes buzzing over
his desert homestead drowned out his portable radio has been
charged with using a 4-foot-square mirror to flash blinding
sunlight into pilots' eyes.
   Alcide Chaisson, 69, who lives in a trailer near Crystalaire
Airport, was cited Friday for obstructing a flight path, Los
Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia L. Ulfig said.
   ``It could be very hazardous,'' Ms. Ulfig said. ``They were
being blinded as they landed and took off.''
   Chaisson lives about 45 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
Crystalaire Airport is a small airfield serving private aircraft.
   The offense carries six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   ``The landing was the part that bothered us most. It was
definitely a real obvious distraction,'' said George Thomas, who
flies tow planes used to launch gliders.

   No weapons or explosives were found on the man, identified only

   The statement did not explain how the man planned to force the

have been under the influence of drugs.
   Thirty minutes after the airliner took off on a 600-mile flight
from Jiddah for the capital, Riyadh, the man gave a flight
attendant a note for the captain, the statement said.
   It demanded that the plane be flown to Larnaca, Cyprus, where
the hijacker and some companions would blow it up, the ministry
statement said.
   The pilot returned to Jiddah and when the plane landed, guards
overpowered the man and evacuated the passengers, the statement
said.
   The man was taken away for interrogation. The statement gave no

   An explosion destroyed a closed resort
hotel, and police said Sunday that organized crime figures were
probably responsible. Five months ago, the hotel manager's son was
gunned down in the street.
   No injuries were reported in the blast Saturday night at the U
Riposo hotel in Sagone on Corsica's western coast, police
investigators said.
   Whoever set the blast used bottles of gas and 220 pounds of
unidentified explosives that smashed the foundation of the 22-room,
three-story hotel, hurled rubble across the street and lit up the
night sky, police said.
   The hotel was for sale and had been closed since the end of the
summer.
   On Aug. 7, Jean Renouard, the son of the hotel manager, was shot
to death while sitting in his car.
   The previous manager, Jean Dupuis, was killed in a similar
fashion in 1985. Dupuis had been involved with a local citizens'
law enforcement organization.
   Police did not explain why organized crime figures would have
targeted the hotel or its staff.
   Organized crime in Corsica, a poor region whose main industries
are fishing and tourism, has traditionally been based on
kidnapping, extortion and murder. In recent years gangsters have
increasingly turned their attention to drugs.

<TEXT>
   Spain's plans to stage a
headline-grabbing 500th birthday party for America in 1992 have
stirred up a storm of controversy over how Portugal is celebrating
its own discoverers, who were charting the Atlantic before
Christopher Columbus was born.
   Spain and Portugal were archrivals in the push in the 15th and
16th centuries to sail off the end of known maps and find new
worlds. Both succeeded.
   But now, many Portuguese fear their neighbors are stealing the
limelight for the 1992 fiesta.
   At the center of Spain's celebrations is Seville's Expo '92, a
530-acre international fair that is set to end a six-month run Oct.
12, 1992, 500 years to the day after Columbus reached the Caribbean
island of San Salvador.
   Also making Spain hot property in 1992 will be the excitement of
the Summer Olympic games in Barcelona. And the European Economic
Community has chosen Madrid as its cultural capital on the eve of
the trading bloc's deadline to create a single European market.
   Compared with all that, Portugal's 1992 celebrations seem
lackluster.
   Lisbon's government-appointed National Discoveries Commission is
promoting research, exhibitions and the publishing of more history
books about the era.
   It has commissioned American composer Philip Glass to write an
opera for 1992 release, based probably on the Lusiads _ an epic
poem about Vasco da Gama's voyages that was written by Portugal's
16th century roving bard, Luis de Camoes.
   But the Spaniards got there first by casting Catalan soprano
Montserrat Caballe and tenor Jose Carreras in Cristobal Colon, an
opera based on trials and tribulations of the Genoese captain. It
sold out when it premiered in Barcelona in September.
   News media, executives and even historians here have called for
more glamour to promote Portugal's past glories and to show that it
is a rapidly modernizing European country.
   ``I'm ashamed at how my country is celebrating the
discoveries,'' said Waldemar de Abreu, a Lisbon publisher and
editor of ``The Portuguese Christopher Columbus _ Secret Agent of
King Dom Joao II,'' a 600-page book that claims proof the explorer
was Portuguese.
   ``Portugal could easily have pooled resources with Spain and
staged an Iberian discoveries exhibition in 1992,'' de Abreu said.
   While admitting Spain ``is pegging all the force of its
modernization on 1992,'' Vasco Graca Moura, head of the
Commission's executive board, makes no apologies for not going
overboard in that year.
   ``The main difference is that Spain is only commemorating one
date and a short journey _ Columbus' voyage in 1492 to the West
Indies,'' he said.
   ``Our celebrations began last year with Bartolomeu Dias and will
only end in 2000, with Pedro Alvares Cabral.''
   Spurred by their pioneering Prince Henry the Navigator's studies
of astronomy and cartography, Portuguese seafarers had claimed the
island of Madeira and the mid-Atlantic Azores archipelago by 1430.
   Dias took his ship around the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, leaving
da Gama to open up the sea route to India 10 years later.
   Cabral discovered Brazil in 1500, the Portuguese went east of
India to Japan, and Fernao de Magalhaes _ better known as Magellan
_ closed the Discoveries circle in 1520 by commanding the first
expedition to sail around the world.
   ``Our commemorations match our dimension _ we're smaller than
Spain, so honestly we can't be as elaborate,'' said the
commission's Antonio Mega Ferreira, though adding Portugal still
has a few tricks up its sleeve.
   Lisbon last week submitted its candidacy to the Paris-based
International Exhibitions Bureau, to hold Expo '98 _ a three-month,
international fair, only about a tenth the size of Seville.
   Instead of trying for the Olympics, Portugal is expected to bid
in January to hold soccer's World Cup in 1998.
   Expo '98's theme will be East meets West, its hero _ Vasco da
Gama. Graca Moura argues da Gama's trips to the Orient were as
important as Columbus' discovery in the West.
   Mega Ferreira's plans for Expo '98 include a subway train
connecting the undeveloped left bank of the Tagus estuary with
Lisbon's historic Belem district.
   Belem is already the site of three ornate monuments to the
discoveries _ Belem tower and Jeronimos monastery, and former
dictator Antonio Oliveira Salazar's colossal, caravel-shaped
``Padrao'' _ a pillar that navigators used to leave behind them on
land to mark the spread of the Portuguese empire.
   Salazar in 1940 organized an exhibition called ``O Mundo
Portugues'' _ the Portuguese world, that glorified the country's
discoveries and African empire to distract attention from its
isolation in Europe and World War II that was going on around it.
   ``The (center-right) government has a complex of being linked to
Salazar. They're frightened they'd be accused of nationalism, if
they did more to glorify our history,'' de Abreu said. ``But
nobody's accusing Spain's socialist government of anything, and
what is Seville if not a glorification of Spain's colonial past?''

   The man, about 40 years old, was taken to a hospital but was

Davis, then Richard Jackson and could not provide his hometown.
   Police interrogated him for three days and he told them he

   French authorities contacted British officials to see whether
anyone of similar description was reported missing in Britain.

   He was born in Pistoia in 1910 and graduated from the University
of Torino in 1932. He went on to teach political philosophy and
history of political thought at the universities of Trieste and
Rome.
   In 1984, he was elected to the Italian Senate as a member of the
dominant Christian Democrat party.
   His best known book was ``The Problem of Atheism,'' published in
1964.
   In a telegram sent to Del Noce's widow, Angela, Pope John Paul
II expressed his condolences and praised the philosopher's ``daily
commitment, in studying Christian thought, to seeking constructive
dialogue and developing the modern themes of philosophy.''

<HEAD>Nuclear Waste Projects Fell Farther Behind in 1989</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of costly delay in solving
America's nuclear waste disposal problems, the Energy Department in
1989 expected to take two big steps forward. Instead it took three
backwards.
   Thus, four decades after the nation began splitting atoms to
make electricity for consumers and nuclear weapons for the
military, prospects for permanently isolating the long-lived
reactor wastes from the human environment remain in doubt.
   In 1989, the Energy Department under a new secretary, retired
Adm. James D. Watkins, was to have broken ground on an exploratory
shaft at Nevada's Yucca Mountain to study the desert site's
suitability as an underground dump for high-level nuclear waste.
Nevada resisted, and Watkins retreated to reevaluate the whole
project.
   Progress toward opening a dump, Watkins said, was crucial to
reviving the civilian nuclear power industry, which canceled more
reactors during the 1980s that it completed. Public opposition to
further expansion of the nuclear industry is based in part on
concern about a buildup of wastes at reactor sites nationwide.
   About 18,000 metric tons of high-level radioactive waste
currently are stored in cooling ponds in 41 states, and the waste
total is expected to double by 1995.
   By November, Watkins had decided the Yucca Mountain shaft would
be delayed at least two years because of Nevada's resistance and
other problems. Also, he pushed back the projected opening date of
a waste dump to 2010 _ a seven-year delay.
   To make matters worse for Watkins, Nevada in the final week of
the year told the department it would not grant state environmental
permits to study the site, and then filed suit in federal court
seeking to force the project out of the state.
   The future of the Nevada project is likely to be one of the
hottest items on Watkins' agenda in 1990. Besides the legal and
political battles with Nevada, Watkins must find someone to manage
the on-site work. The company he planned to pay $1 billion to
manage the site, Bechtel Systems Management Inc., was disqualified
by a federal judge in August who said the selection process was
unfair.
   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, has sought to cast
the Yucca Mountain delays in a positive light, saying Watkins now
has ``a very doable game plan'' that will restore public confidence
in the department's ability to complete the project, which already
has chewed up about $500 million of utility ratepayer funds.
   A less dramatic but equally troublesome setback for Watkins was
his failure to open in New Mexico the nation's first permanent dump
for plutonium-contaminated wastes from government nuclear weapons
plants.
   As late as June 3, Watkins was reassuring the public that the
$800 million Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, buried in a salt cavern
near Carlsbad, N.M., would begin accepting nuclear waste in
September as scheduled. He cautioned against ``inaccurate public
alarm'' over problems that could delay the project. Three weeks
later, though, he officially abandoned the September starting date
and said the best he could hope for was an opening sometime next
summer.
   Construction of the New Mexico dump is virtually complete, but
efforts to certify its safety have been plagued by doubts that it
would contain the long-lived wastes as specified by regulations of
the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Delays in the New Mexico project in 1989 created yet a third
waste disposal problem: where to temporarily store
plutonium-contaminated wastes from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant in Colorado. Idaho, which had been accepting surplus Rocky
Flats waste, imposed a ban last September. Gov. Cecil Andrus said
he acted because the department failed to open the New Mexico dump
as promised.
   This added still another twist to the waste dilemma: Since waste
storage at Rocky Flats is approaching a limit agreed to by the
Energy Department, the plant would be forced to close in 1990 if no
alternative storage can be found early in the year.
   Watkins in October tried to persuade seven states _ Washington,
Idaho, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Tennessee and South Carolina _
to accept equal portions of excess Rocky Flats waste next year in
order to keep the plant open. But all seven governors turned him
down, and the problem remains unresolved.
   Stephen A. Wakefield, the department's general counsel, said
last week the Rocky Flats waste storage limit of 1,600 cubic yards
is likely to be reached by next summer.
   Because operation of Rocky Flats is of ``paramount national
importance,'' President Bush could force states to accept waste
from the plant, Wakefield said.
   ``We have the club in the closet, but it's a last resort,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Anglers will find it easier to catch their
limit of South Dakota walleye in 1990, but not because the finicky
game fish is suddenly more willing to take the bait.
   The legal daily catch has been cut from six to four as of
Monday, annoying fishermen and prompting warnings that tourism may
suffer.
   The problem is that anglers are getting too good at catching the
tasty fish.
   While fishermen once had to guess where the elusive and feisty
walleyes were lurking, many now rely on electronic sonar units to
locate them, said Dennis Unkenholz, a biologist for the Game, Fish
and Parks Department.
   ``There's more people fishing more hours,'' Unkenholz said.
``They're using bigger boats and sophisticated fishing equipment.''
   ``Walleyes are a renewable resource, but they can only sustain
so much harvest,'' he added.
   The Game, Fish and Parks Commission made the unexpected cut Nov.
6 and reaffirmed its decision Dec. 8. The agency said that in some
places, heavy fishing has caused a ``noticeable decline in the
quality of the fishery and places the future of the fishery in
serious jeopardy.''
   Unkenholz said that the reduced limit won't affect many people
because few anglers catch the limit anyway.
   South Dakota will see fewer non-resident anglers because of the
change, said Larry Atkinson, chairman of the Tourism Advisory
Board. Fishing contributes $70 million a year to South Dakota's
economy, he said.
   ``It will have a severe impact on especially the businesses that
are hanging on by a thread now,'' he said.
   Bait shops and campgrounds catering to anglers dot the shoreline
along the four Missouri River reservoirs in South Dakota. Walleyes
also are the main fare in natural lakes in eastern South Dakota.
   Since fishing licenses are not issued specifically for walleyes,
it's not possible to say exactly how many people cast their lines
for walleyes each year in South Dakota. The state record for
walleyes is about 15 pounds, although most of those caught range
between one-half pound and three pounds.

Ceausescu and Communism ``strangled, almost literally'' the
nation's intellectuals and the traditions they preserved.
   ``We are an intelligentsia of survivors,'' Sorescu said softly.
In the first years of Communism, ``intellectuals were
systematically hunted. Tens of thousands were exterminated in
camps,'' he said.
   That horror of the Stalinist 1950s _ when teachers, priests,
anybody with a brain or mastery of a foreign language was a
suspected spy or enemy of the people _ gave way in 1965 to
President Ceausescu.
   At first, Ceausescu appeared to many Romanians to be a liberal
Communist leader. He permitted more nationalist culture, defied the
Kremlin and refused to take part in the invasion of Czechoslovakia
in 1968.
   ``1968 was a big trap,'' Sorescu recalled, sitting in the
favorite room of his Bucharest home, lined with books, paintings
and other examples of traditional Romanian culture. After that, he
said, ``evil became a way of life.''
   ``The terror was horrible, and sacrifice was continuous, every
year,'' said the slim, moustachioed writer. ``Imagine if the
Jacobin terror had lasted 40 years.''
   According to Sorescu, the terror peaked for intellectuals in the
early 1980s, when Ceausescu decided to impose his order on the
Writers' Union, one of the last bastions of potential resistance to
his increasingly paranoic rule.
   Sorescu was one leading intellectual who, while avoiding open
dissidence, refused to go along with the constant pressure to sign
his name to prepared poems eulogizing Ceausescu, to inform on his
friends, or to live and write as Ceausescu thought fit.
   As a result, he received death threats on the phone and in his
mail. Neighbors and other informants would keep careful watch on
his house.
   In 1982, he spent three months under house arrest after he was
linked to a ``conspiracy'' against Ceausescu for dedicating a book
to a member of a group of arrested transcendentalists.
   The constant surveillance and awareness that all conversations
in his house were bugged meant that Sorescu never uttered
Ceausescu's name and never discussed with friends where his
manuscripts were hidden.
   Despite the repression, he managed to publish some 30 volumes of
poetry, essays and plays in Romania. But, he said, all were missing
banned passages or verses that he could only publish abroad or keep
in his drawer.
   ``The leading couple couldn't bear any popularity beyond their
own,'' he said of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu. ``They were jealous,
jealous of the living and of the dead.''
   For this reason, Sorescu said, Ceausescu forbade any celebration
this year of the centenary of the 19th century writer Mihai Manescu.
   Sorescu cautioned that the revolution that toppled Ceausescu
Dec. 22 is not over yet. ``The social mechanism of Communism has to
be destroyed,'' he stressed.
   ``When we see the underground tunnels, the double walls in every
building, the fact that people could simply disappear,'' he said,
``we will realize what torture our lives were until now and wonder
if we escaped psychologically sane.''
   For Sorescu, the network of terror inspired him to write and to
reject several offers to live abroad, knowing he should stay and
preserve the Romania he said Ceausescu was destroying.
   Repression ``created the contrary'' for Sorescu. ``It gave me
extraordinary energy to write,'' he said.

   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, will
journey to Boston on Tuesday to attend the funeral of their
brother-in-law, Alexander Ellis II, the White House said Sunday.
   Ellis died Friday of a stroke following intestinal surgery. The
67-year-old insurance executive was the husband of the president's
sister, Nancy Walker Bush Ellis.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters of the
Bushes' decision aboard Air Force One as the president flew here
from Houston to visit soldiers wounded in Panama.
   He said former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
called the Bushes on Saturday to express their condolences.
   The president has been in Texas since Wednesday on a five-day,
year-end vacation.
   Bush is scheduled to return to the White House on Monday night
after stopping in Montgomery, Ala., to go bass fishing on New
Year's Day on his way home from Houston.
   The White House had no immediate details on what time Bush would
fly to Boston on Tuesday.

   HOUSTON _ Home away from home for President Bush is Suite 271 in
the Houstonian Hotel _ two bedrooms and a parlor at the government
discount rate of $88 a room per night, plus access to a world-class
fitness facility on a wooded, 22-acre estate.
   The Houstonian here in Bush's adopted hometown _ not 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue _ is his legal residence. It's the only home he
has left in Texas.
   It is a short jog from his old neighborhood, and not far from
the glittering Galleria shopping center and skyscrapers of this oil
town where Bush's political career got its start.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, spend five to 10 nights a year at
the Houstonian. The rest of the time, the presidential suite is
open to other wayfarers for $550 a night _ a good deal steeper than
the flat $88 per room the Houstonian charges Bush and other
government workers in his entourage.
   It is not the ritziest hotel in Houston by a long shot, but it
does boast a world-class health club and a mile-long, Astroturf
jogging trail that snakes around the Houstonian's campus, hard by
the Buffalo Bayou and just outside the Loop, the main artery around
Houston.
   The Houstonian actually is more of a retreat center for
corporate conferences than a carriage-trade hotel.
   ``Joe Smith the traveling salesman we don't get,'' said General
Manager Louis R. Lanzino.
   Bush started hanging his hat at the Houstonian after selling his
old home nearby when he moved to Washington in 1981 to become vice
president.
   Why did Bush choose the Houstonian?
   ``It's a great place for him. It's secluded, it's got a
wonderful health club, familiar surroundings,'' said Stephen Hart,
a deputy White House spokesman.
   ``It's close to Otto's Bar-B-Q and friends in the (Houston)
Country Club,'' added Hart, singling out two disparate touchstones
of Bush's existence in Houston.
   Otto's, an unpretentious cafeteria-style eatery, remains a
favorite Bush haunt. And Bush, winding up a year-end vacation, got
in a round of golf Saturday at the Houston Country Club, which
costs $35,000 to join.
   ``He has to be from somewhere,'' said Craig Miller, concierge at
the adjacent Inn on the Park, who still remembers Bush as his local
congressman.
   The Houstonian does not get a lot of guests' requesting to sleep
in the president's bed.
   ``Every now and then the local Democrats rent it and have
something in there. They think that's fairly clever,'' said Miller.
   ``Our presidential suite is a very nice suite, but it's not
overdone,'' said Lanzino, choosing his adjectives carefully. He
described the Bushes as ``very down-to-earth people, and the suite
is reflective of that.''
   The Houstonian is owned by a local developer, Joe Russo, and a
Saudi businessman, Ahmad Mannai. With 300 hotel rooms and 35
conference rooms, it was near capacity when Bush and his entourage
of aides, Secret Service agents and communications specialists
rolled in Friday night.
   Most Houstonian rooms have ``servi-bars'' that offer guests
snacks and drinks _ for a price. But not Bush's suite.
   ``We've been asked to not have `servi-bars' in there,'' said
Lanzino. ``The president likes diet soft drinks and fresh fruit, so
we have that available all the time.''
   If the hotel rooms are modest, the health club is not, from the
full size gym to racquetball and tennis courts, sauna, massage and
a locker room where attendants dispense both fruit juices and
Heineken beer in cans. There is an indoor track with computerized
pacing lights that loops around nearly 80 yards worth of weight
machines, treadmills, stair-walkers and other muscle-building gear.
   ``The president claims that we have the best masseuse in the
world here,'' said Lanzino.
   The compliment is for a 47-year-old onetime South Vietnamese
major called John, who charges $40 for a one-hour massage.
   John _ his real name is Huynh Duy Nguyen _ came to be a masseur
fairly late in life. He was trained in kung fu in Vietnam, but
abandoned the martial art after seriously injuring a friend in the
fight.
   Now he uses his hands on the backs of the president of the
United States and other clients.
   ``My job, I love it,'' he said. ``Mr. President is a very
special customer. He's very good for me.''

   Despair created the swiftest
revolution in the remarkable year that rid six East European
countries of Stalinism. What took years in Poland, months in
Hungary, and weeks in East Germany, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia
was accomplished in a few days in Romania.
   But the country's new provisional leaders face the most complex
task of any Eastern Europeans, improvising a democratic government
from the ground up after inheriting the remnants of a totalitarian
system.
   The revolt first stirred Dec. 15 in the western city of
Timisoara, when hundreds overcame the fear of Nicolae Ceausescu's
regime to defend an ethnic Hungarian pastor who had battled for
religious and human rights.
   Inspired young workers and students took to the streets of
Timisoara to cry for bread and freedom. Their massacre, reported to
Romanians by Radio Free Europe, their lifeline to each other and to
the outside world, stirred the rest of the country and sparked
unrest in several cities.
   The revolution reached the vital center of the country,
Bucharest, after Ceausescu returned Dec. 20 from a three-day visit
to Iran. He branded the Timisoara demonstrators ``hooligans'' and
organized a rally to support his views.
   ``It was when he called Romanians terrorists and hooligans that
it was enough,'' said Bogdan Lazaroae, a 21-year-old Bucharest
student. ``We work hard for him to build his golden palaces, and he
calls us terrorists.''
   Students turned the pro-Ceausescu rally into an anti-Ceausescu
protest, then held out for hours against security forces who shot
at them. By the morning of Dec. 22, workers had joined the
students, and crowds swarmed over the tanks sent to mow them down.
The army _ long held down by Ceausescu and used for farming and
construction rather than fighting _ switched sides.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, fled their capital Dec. 22 as the
first waves of spontaneous joy and exultation crackled through
radio and television, by then in the hands of revolutionaries.
   Ion Iliescu _ who is now president _ and other revolutionary
leaders were summoned to the radio and television stations by the
demonstrators.
   Once on the air, Iliescu summoned all Romanians who wanted to
restore the country to attend a 5 p.m. meeting at Communist Party
headquarters.
   There, men and women who had objected to Ceausescu's rule but
were kept apart for months or years by watchful security agents met
other. New voices, like Petre Roman, emerged. Roman is now the
premier.
   Members of the makeshift government were forced to move around
in armored cars and shift headquarters by day. The population that
rejoiced at Ceausescu's downfall _ and with it the end of Communism
_ became fearful the old system could return and afraid that
Ceausescu's inheritors, many of them ex-Communists, would not
embrace real democracy.
   Free elections are promised for April, a schedule that seems
impossibly hasty in a country where there have been no politics for
more than 20 years.
   Conservative parties banned after the Communist takeover in 1947
are beginning to emerge, but, in a country where communications are
poor and radio and television are the only media reaching
nationwide, it is uncertain how much national impact they can have
by April.
   The governing National Salvation Committee said it is not a
party and therefore not a contender in the elections.
   While adopting some of the language of democracy _ separating
its powers, for instance, from those of the government _ the
committee and Iliescu have taken enormous power into their hands.
   Acting as an ad hoc legislature, they have repealed Ceausescu's
most hated laws, opened the borders for Romanians to travel,
appointed ministers and taken over the state-run media. Iliescu and
his defense minister, Gen. Nicolae Militaru, command the 180,000
army troops, and have already _ without explaining why _ sacked a
general who helped them during the revolt.
   The declaratory nature of their decrees rings old-style
Communist, even if the content is liberal, revealing how hard it
will be to overcome the stylistic remnants of Ceausescu's rule.
   Dealing with the economy will pose more enormous problems for
the new government.
   Pursuing a vision of a Greater Romania, Ceausescu burdened his
traditionally agricultural nation with industries it did not need
and could not run.
   He polluted the land, air and water with his grandiose projects
and destroyed the national heritage in cities and towns forced to
don the mask of his dreams for the proletariat _ towering apartment
blocks that looked modern but hid communal bathrooms and crumbling
walls.
   Nothing can reconstruct the thousands of old homes and 22
churches that disappeared so Ceausescu could build the Palace of
the Republic and Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism in central
Bucharest.
   His self-aggrandizing visions did give Bucharest a useful, and
efficient subway system. He also apparently managed to pay off the
foreign debt he ran up for his own glory _ by exporting the food
his people needed.
   Western diplomats in Bucharest see the lack of debt as one
potential asset as Romania's new leaders try to rebuild the nation.
   Other assets are Romania's oilfields and its scenic tourist
attractions. Romanians also have a flair for business and have
managed to salvage their peasant traditions on the land that should
be able to feed them in abundance.

<HEAD>More Judges Needed To Fight Drug War, Rehnquist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's war on drugs cannot be won if
Congress does not create more federal judgeships, Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist said Sunday.
   One of every four criminal cases handled by the nation's federal
courts is drug-related, Rehnquist said, adding, ``Some courts,
especially in border states, are approaching the outer limits of
caseload and fatigue from handling drug-related cases.''
   In his annual year-end report on the federal court system, the
chief justice said, ``From a federal law enforcement perspective,
the war on drugs will fail if the judiciary is not given the
judgeships necessary to do the job.''
   He urged Congress to ``take immediate action'' to create the 59
additional trial judgeships and 16 more appellate judgeships
requested last October by the U.S. Judicial Conference, the
policy-making arm of the federal court system. Rehnquist heads the
conference.
   To date, Congress has authorized 575 federal trial judgeships
and 168 appellate judgeships. No new judgeship has been created
since 1984.
   Rehnquist warned against creating ``an hour-glass-shaped law
enforcement system'' to battle illegal drug trafficking.
   ``Huge personnel assets have been added to bring about more
prosecutions and huge assets have been devoted to prisons to house
the convicted,'' he said. ``But without the judge power to handle
the added workload there will be a bottleneck in the middle.''
   Rehnquist cited statistics indicating that federal trial judges
now handle nearly four times as many drug cases as they did in 1980
_ from about 3,000 a year to over 11,000 a year.
   The greatest bulk of drug-related cases, as well as most
criminal cases, are handled by state courts.
   A spokesman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
said 68 percent of all new criminal cases filed in federal courts
in Iowa are drug-related; 60 percent in northern West Virginia.
   Statistics indicate that in the area of Texas encompassing the
cities of Houston, Galveston, Laredo and Corpus Christi, drug cases
represented 24.4 percent of all criminal cases in 1985 but now
represent 53.6 percent.
   Rehnquist said one of every 10 cases reaching federal appeals
courts is drug-related, representing more than half the criminal
cases handled by the appeals courts.
   He also asked President Bush and Congress to fill existing
judicial vacancies, now numbering 61.
   ``Nine of these are `judicial emergencies,' having been vacant
for over 18 months,'' Rehnquist said.
   The administrative office said two of those nine vacancies exist
in federal trial courts in New York City. The remaining seven are
in appeals courts based in New Orleans, San Francisco and the
District of Columbia and in trial courts in Pennsylvania, Colorado,
the Virgin Islands and Guam.
   On another subject, Rehnquist praised Congress for recently
voting to raise the salaries of all federal judges _ by 35 percent
as of next January.
   And he said a 1988 law that gave the Supreme Court greater
discretion over the cases it chooses to review ``is having a very
beneficial impact on the court's selection of cases.''
   Through the first two months of its 1989-90 term, the nation's
highest court has granted review in significantly fewer cases than
in past terms.
   Referring to the Dec. 16 killing in Birmingham, Ala., of Judge
Robert S. Vance, a member of the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, Rehnquist said, ``It serves as a ready reminder
that judges, like other law enforcement officers, find themselves
literally on the firing line as a result of the duties of the
office that they hold.''

<TEXT>
   Two weeks after the revolution broke
out, there still is no official word on how many people died in
street fighting throughout Romania. Estimates range from hundreds
to several tens of thousands.
   As the first sketchy witness accounts began to trickle out of
the western city of Timisoara where the uprising began, the death
toll was first estimated at hundreds, then thousands.
   Then the revolution spread to other areas in Transylvania and
finally to the capital, Bucharest. As fighting escalated in the
streets with security forces loyal to Nicolae Ceausescu battling
the army and young revolutionaries, the estimates of dead rose. At
one point a report set the number at up to 70,000.
   But only days later, French health officials were told about 700
had died.
   Initial reports from witnesses and citizens in Timisoara, where
security forces opened fire on unarmed demonstrators Dec. 17, set
the death toll in the hundreds, then appeared to concur in
estimates of between 2,000 and 4,500.
   At one point, there were estimates that 12,000 people were
killed in Timisoara, more than 7,000 of them reportedly executed by
the security forces after being detained.
   But Western journalists returning from Timisoara and other
cities in the region where heavy fighting had been reported said
they doubted those figures, and thought the total likely would turn
out to be much lower.
   On Dec. 22, the day Ceausescu was toppled and tried to escape
the capital by helicopter from the roof of his palace, U.S.
diplomats said they saw 13 killed in Bucharest.
   But East European news agencies reporting out of Bucharest
before Western reporters were able to enter the country said
hundreds had died.
   The following day, Dr. Marian Palaschivescu said he alone had
counted 54 bodies, and an Austrian pilot said he counted 30 bodies
at the airport after fierce fighting on Dec. 24.
   Ninety bodies were counted that day at only one of many morgues
in the city.
   The East German news agency ADN reported that the National
Salvation Committee seeking to run the country estimated that 5,000
were killed in only two days of fighting.
   On Christmas day, Hungarian radio cited ``authoritative
sources'' as saying some 70,000 had died and 300,000 were injured.
   But Victor Ciobanu, the health minister under Ceausescu now
supporting the provisional government, said that day that 500 had
died in Bucharest over the previous four days of fighting.
   The day after Christmas, Romanians in Bucharest began preparing
to bury their dead, and 200 freshly dug graves were counted in one
cemetery.
   French health officials were told this week that 746 people had
died in the revolution, but Western diplomats estimated from
witness accounts and their own assessments that some 10,000 people
had died.

   A 600-foot Greek freighter loaded with scrap
metal sank in the Pacific early Sunday after its 28 crewmen gave up
a two-day fight to pump seawater out of its hold and abandoned
ship, the Coast Guard said.
   The Vulka went down 800 miles northeast of Hawaii.
   The crewmen were evacuated to the Coast Guard buoy tender
Sassafras on Saturday when malfunctioning pumps failed to keep
ahead of the flooding that made the bow dip below the waterline,
officials said.
   The cause of the flooding was not determined before the ship
went down, officials said.
   There was no immediate estimate of the value of the ship and its
cargo.
   Crewmen had used pumps dropped from Coast Guard planes in an
effort to keep the ship afloat until a commercial salvage ship from
Honolulu could reach the scene Monday, said Coast Guard Chief Petty
Officer Dennis Hubbard.
   The Sassafras also unsuccessfully tried to tow the Vulka around,
away from the wind, to keep waves from washing over the bow,
Hubbard said.
   The Vulka was carrying cargo from Los Angeles to South Korea
when it radioed a distress call Friday.

<TEXT>
   Morocco appealed for help Sunday in its
battle to keep a 230-square-mile oil slick off its coastline and to
stop more oil from spilling from an Iranian tanker damaged in an
explosion two weeks ago.
   The spill was just 17 miles from shore when the government
issued the appeal on the official Moroccan Press Agency.
   An explosion aboard the Iranian tanker Khark on Dec. 19 tore
through the ship's hull as it sailed 400 miles north of Las Palmas
in the Canary Islands. The cause of the explosion was not known.
   A subsequent fire forced the 35 crew members to abandon ship,
and the vessel and her leaking cargo began drifting toward
northwest Africa.
   Morocco appealed to Britain, France, Spain and Portugal for help
in cleaning up the 37 million gallons of petroleum that spilled
from the tanker and formed the huge slick, the news agency said.
   Even French marine scientist Jacques-Yves Cousteau was asked to
help.
   The ship, which was loaded with 142 million gallons of oil, was
floating Sunday about 45 miles off the city of Safi, south of
Rabat. Specialists were trying to plug the gash in the hull.
   Potential damage to fishing stocks, tourism and other coastal
industries could cost 100,000 people their jobs, the news agency
said. An ``ecological catastrophe'' will result if the slick
reaches land, it added.
   King Hassan II's government formed a council to deal with the
crisis, but experts have had little luck dispersing the slick, the
news agency said.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir ignited a major
political crisis Sunday by firing a top Labor Party minister he
accused of meeting with PLO officials.
   Shamir accused Science Minister Ezer Weizman of defying
government policy against contacts with the Palestine Liberation
OrganizatiOnXand of conspiring ``behind the prime minister's back''
with the PLO.
   Vice Premier Shimon Peres, the Labor leader, said Shamir's
action provoked ``a very serious crisis.''
   ``The prime minister must rescind his decision,'' he said on
armed forces radio, adding ``we have nothing to compromise about.''
   Energy Minister Moshe Shahal, a leading Labor figure, suggested
Shamir wanted to ``torpedo the political initiative'' to avoid a
showdown with the United States over proposals for talks with
Palestinians and elections in the occupied territories.
   A meeting of American, Egyptian and Israeli foreign ministers is
scheduled for January in Washington.
   Labor leaders planned to meet with Peres to determine what to do
next.
   A Likud official who demanded anonymity suggested Labor would
stay in the government because it would not want to turn an
election into a referendum on whether to meet with the PLO.
   Although this was the most serious crisis of the year-old
government, there appeared to be some room for reconciliation.
   Shamir's dismissal letter does not take effect for 48 hours,
giving both parties time to work out a compromise as they have done
in repeated past crises over the past six years of coalition rule.
   Shamir said he hoped the government would not break up over the
issue. He sce Labor should not defend Weizman because he had
violated a government consensus against dealing with the PLO, which
he labeled a terrorist organization.
   ``Here's a Cabinet minister who not only acts against the
government policy, behind the prime minister's back, with our most
cangerous enemies (but) he ... instructs them how to confront our
arguments, how to conduct their relations with the United States
and how to spoil our moves.
   ``How long can we suffer this situation?'' Shamir said, thumping
his fist on a table.
   Shamir said Weizman, a 65-year-old former defense minister and
fighter pilot, had passed messages to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
and met with PLO offcials whom he declined to name.
   Weizman declined to say whether he met with anyone from the PLO
but said he had met with Dr. Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli-Arab doctor
whom foreign reports have identified as a go-between in Israeli-PLO
contacts. Weizman said he was later contacted by Israeli security
agents who advised him on what to say to Tibi.
   Israel radio reported t@aj the PLO meetings continued until
recently and were held with Peres' full knowledge and approval.
   It said they focused on an attempt to influence the PLO to
accept U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III's plan to arrange
talks between Palestinians and Israelis to revive the stalled peace
plan, and the make up of the Palestinian delegation for the talks.
Israel Television said that in recent months Weizman talked uuh
PLO officials in meetings arranged by Egypt.
   It also claimed Weizman talked with a PLO official in Zurich,
Switzerland, about Peace Now demonstrations in Jerusalem over the
weekend involving 15,000 Palestinians, Israelis and Europeans.
   The protests, which resulted in more than 25 injured and 60
arrested, angered rightwing politicians who claimed they were
arranged by the PLO.
   Weizman accused Shamir of hypocrisy, saying the prime minister
and other Israeli officials had met local PLO activists and
indirectly negotiated with the PLO through the United States.
   But Weizman said Shamir's action might force ``the state of
Israel to decide where it is headed.'-   ``We will have to finally decide
if we talk to Palestinians. ...
I have always said openly, in the press, TV, the Cabinet, that we
should talk to the PLO.''
   Arafat said in Baghdad, Iraq, Sunday that neither he nor any of
his officials had met with Weizman but said a planned meeting in
Moscow two years ago was canceled after Weizman failed to show up.

   A gas explosion rattled the financial
district Sunday, injuring at least four people, shattering windows
and sending glass and debris flying through a one-block area,
authorities said.
   The blast happened about 11:30 a.m., one block from the site of
last mon\h9s fatal crane collapse, police said.
   One of the injured refused treatment and left the scene, said
Assistant Fire Chief"Bill Shaughnesy. Others were treated by
ambulance crews. It could not immediately be determined whether any
victims were taken to the hospital, but all the injuries were
minor, Shaughnesy said.
   Traffic was rerouted around the area, which is bordered by
Chinatown and the financial district, police said. At least 10
buildings were damaged.
   Most businesses along the block were closed at the time. At
least two of the injured were sitting in cars when they were struck
by flying glass, Shaughnesy said.
   ``It was such an explosion that a lot of the evidence is gone
right now. When we arrived, it looked like a bomb had hit here. If
it had happened during a workday, I'm sure there would have been
some serious personal injured,'' Shaughnesy said.
   Officials had no estimate as yet of the monetary damage caused
by the blast, he said.
   Police and fire officials said the explosion was being
investigated, and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. crews were on the
scene trying to determine if the blast occurred inside one of the
buildings or if it was underground.
   One of the buildings near the blast was buckled along the ground
floor, a scene reminiscent of dozens of buildings that collapsed in
the Oct. 17 earthquake that ripped Northern California and killed
67 people.
   Five people were crushed to death on Nov. 28 when a 240-ton
crane toppled from a highrise under construction and crashed to the
ground one block away.

   Visiting President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
pledged his help Sunday in mediating a settlement of the civil war
in southern Sudan.
   Mubarak, in an apparent attempt to make himself acceptable to
the rebels, seemed to pour cold water on an attempt by his host,
military ruler Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir, to reactivate a 1976
defense treaty with Egypt.
   El-Bashir has asked Mubarak, as a friend of Sudan and chairman
of the Organization of African Unity, to mediate a settlement of
the war that is crippling this East African country's economy.
   However, the leader of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army,
Col. John Garang, has demanded the scrapping of Sudan's military
agreements with Egypt and Libya as one condition for making peace.
   The former civilian prime minister, Sadek el-Mahdi, whom
el-Bashir toppled in a coup on June 30, said the agreements were
canceled. But El-Bashir told the official Sudan News Agency
Saturday that Sudan and Egypt are ``consulting on the procedures to
reactivate these agreements.''
   Asked about the treaty Sunday, Mubarak, with el-Bashir standing
by his side, said, ``Sudan and Egypt are one country, and they do
not need defense agreements.''
   Mubarak spoke to reporters at Khartoum airport after arriving
for a one-day visit to celebrate the 34th anniversary of Sudan's
independence.
   ``We have contacts with the Garang movement, and our relations
with the north are strong,'' Mubarak said. ``We are doing our
utmost to solve the problem.''
   Fighting between the southern rebels and the government has
escalated yiice peace talks in Kenya collapsed Dec. 5 after five
days of negotiations. Former President Jimmy Carter acted as
unofficial observer at those talks.

   Credit and bank cards belonging to a family
of four found slain last week were used to buy sneakers, underwear,
electronic equipment and diamonds the day after the killings,
police said Sunday.
   Descriptions and composite drawings of the buyers were
circulated over the weekend by police in the hope that someone
would recognize them.
   Six purchases totaling $1,334 were made Dec. 23, the day the
bodies of Warren Harris, 39, Dolores Harris, 41, and their two
children, ages 11 and 15, were found in their suburban Ithaca home,
police said. The four had been bound, shot in the back of the head
and their bodies set on fire the night before.
   Police believe the cards are being used by a man and a woman,
said Capt. Carl Shaver of the state police Bureau of Criminal
Investigation.
   The partly charred bodies were discovered when a neighbor heard
a smoke alarm. Police said there was no sign of a forced entry, and
neighbors speculated the friendly family may have opened their door
to people saying they had car trouble.
   The Harrises lived in Ellis Hollow, an affluent section of this
rural town about five miles from Ithaca in western New York state.

   Sheriff's deputies responding to a call at
a house owned by actors Bryan Brown and Rachel Ward discovered that
the bombs used in movies look just like the real thing.
   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Sunday the fake
bomb was discovered after a man called from Australia to ask if
deputies could check on his ex-wife and daughter, who were living
in the house. Authorities said the woman, who was not identified,
rents the house from Brown and Ward.
   Upon their arrival at the house Saturday, deputies saw in the
garage what looked like four sticks of dynamite connected to a
timer.
   ``Arson-explosives personnel responded and confirmed that it was
a movie prop,'' said Sgt. Mark Dailey.
   ``It ended up being empty tubes stuffed with newspaper,'' said
Deputy Steven Wilson. ``But it had all the right markings and it
was the right shape and color.'' He added that the device looked so
real the bomb squad decided to confiscate it.
   Similar props were used in the 1986 movie ``F-X,'' in which
Brown played a special-effects expert who used smoke bombs, fake
blood and dummies to elude pursuers.
   Miss Ward, who is Brown's wife, has appeared in such films as
``Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid'' and ``Sharkey's Machine.''

<TEXT>
   A non-profit corporation has been formed to
channel medical supplies and other emergency contributions to
Panama, where fighting left thousands homeless and many wounded, an
official said Sunday.
   ``AID To Panama'' has been designated as the official
organization to receive funds and other contributions, said Carlos
F. Rodriguez, Panama's newly appointed ambassador to the United
States.
   ``Our task of rebuilding our beloved country has begun,'' said
Rodriguez in a statement. ``However, urgent humanitarian needs are
still unmet and all help is needed. We appreciate all offers of
assistance from our American friends.''
   Rodriguez said the need is greatest in Panama City, where a week
of fighting has left an estimated 25,000 people homeless and care
for the many wounded is urgent. Hospitals face dire shortages of
all medical supplies, he said.
   Dr. Jose Trinidad Castillero, Panama's minister of health, has
issued an urgent appeal for intravenous solutions, antibiotics,
insulin, and anaesthetics. The shortage of blood is so severe, that
doctors at Santo Tomas Hospital donated their own blood, Rodriguez
said.
   ``AID to Panama'' is working with Catholic Relief Services and
Direct Relief International, two groups organized to respond to
international health care needs. Corporate donations of supplies
and transportation already have been received but Rodriguez said
individual cash donations are urgently needed.
   Checks and other contributions should be made to ``AID To
Panama'' and sent to either:
   Catholic Relief Services, 209 W. Fayette Street, Baltimore,
21202; or, ``AID To Panama'' Sun Bank (Acct. No. 01-890-0114-0297),
777 Brickell Ave., Miami, Fla. 33131.

<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official in the new government
declared Sunday that the Communist Party is dead and will not be
allowed to take control as the country moves toward democracy in
the new year.
   Also Sunday Romania's interim president, Ion Iliescu, abolished
the death penalty, saying that the late Nicolae Ceausescu and his
wife were ``the last persons that deserved this fate.'' The couple
was executed a week ago.
   Iliescu, in a New Year's address, also reaffirmed the nation's
commitment to political pluralism and re-introduced the concept of
private ownership.
   In other developments, the Agerpres news agency reported that
the former head of the dreaded Securitate secret police had been
detained, and army units continued to search for Securitate
holdouts loyal to Ceausescu.
   But there were no reports of major clashes as Romanians
celebrated their first free New Year's Eve in decades.
   One newspaper carried a warning from police asking holiday
merrymakers not to use fireworks and noisemakers in the capital,
where the streets were filled with nervous soldiers armed with
automatic weapons.
   Hungarian television reported that an assailant it did not
identify stabbed Ceausescu's son, Nicu, immediately after he was
shown on Romanian television Dec. 22.
   The assailant was arrested while the younger Ceausescu underwent
an operation for his stomach wound ``which was successful,''
Hungarian TV said.
   Nicu Ceausescu was the Communist Party chief in the Transylvania
town of Sibiu until the revolution that ousted his father. He was
one of dozens of Ceausescu family members who were given positions
of power.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Corneliu Bogdan, one of the members of
the government that took over after Ceausescu's overthrow Dec. 22,
told reporters Sunday there is no danger of Communists gaining the
upper hand again.
   ``The Communist Party is dead,'' Bogdan said, adding that party
members are a minority in the current government, which will run
the country until elections planned in April.
   Bogdan did not say how many Communists were in the temporary
leadership. But he said their expertise was needed.
   ``I was deceived,'' Bogdan said of his own membership in the
party. ``I will pay for it,'' he added without elaboration.
   He said said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would
visit Jan. 5 or 6, and said ``all possibilities are alive'' for
cooperation with the Soviet Union.
   Iliescu, in comments carried by all state media, told the
nation's 23 million people that despite stubborn resistance by
pro-Ceausescu forces, ``the revolution has triumphed and will
remain unvanquishable.''
   The interim govermnent seeks ``a large, novel political
pluralism,'' he declared.
   Iliescu also:
   _promised a moratorium on expensive construction projects
undertaken by Ceausescu despite wide-spread privation at home.
These include the Danube-Bucharest Canal, with a projected cost of
$2.5 billion; and Ceausescu's pet project, the nearly completed
Palace of the Republic, which has consumed $600 million.
   _declared land on which farmers live and surrounding plots
private property, re-establishing a concept banned for decades, and
also announced that farmers would again be allowed to sell produce
and animals raised on leased land, as long as they did not demand
``mercurial prices.''
   Agerpres reported the signing of a decree by Iliescu providing
the legal basis for creation of new political parties _ an
important step toward free elections.
   The decree bans fascist parties and others that ``propagate
ideas at variance to the state and law and order,'' Agerpres said.
   At least six new political parties have emerged since
Ceausescu's overthrow.
   The decree also states that officials of the defense and
interior ministries, judges, prosecutors, members of state radio
and television cannot join political parties, to ensure their
impartiality.
   Ceausescu ruled for 24 years and refused to accept the reforms
orchestrated by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The revolt
against him began Dec. 15 and climaxed Dec. 22 when Ceausescu and
his wife, Elena, fled.
   Agerpres said former Securitate chief Iulian Vlad was arrested
Sunday along with former deputy interior ministers Giani Bucurescu
and Aristotel Stamatoiu, and Vasile Gheorghe, another senior
Interior Ministry offical.
   The four have been removed from active duty and were being held
for questioning, the report said. Vlad is a colonel general, while
the other three are lieutenant generals.
   The Agerpres report did not specify what charges, if any, the
four faced.
   Prime Minister Petre Roman, meanwhile, defended the decision to
execute Ceausescu and his wife after a hasty military trial.
   ``There were great risks in guarding him,'' Roman was quoted as
saying by the Bucharest newspaper Adevarul. ``We had secure
information that (Securitate) paratroopers were prepared to attack
the place where Ceausescu was, and the place was not well guarded.''
   Adevarul _ the former Communist Party daily that now appears as
a non-affiliated daily _ and other newspapers reserved much of
their space for rejoicing over the first New Year's Eve without
Ceausescu.
   Romanians on the street greeted each other and foreigners with
cheerful shouts of ``Multi Ani,'' which means Happy New Year, as
they trudged through the snow and slush or stood in long lines to
buy food for their holiday dinners.
   Many walked up the hill above the broad street Ceausescu named
The Avenue of Socialist Victory, to the 17th century Patriarchal
Church,@Uhere they offered prayers for the dead and asked for
peace, prosperity and freedom in the new year.
   There is no firm figure of how many people died in the Romanian
revolution, but the death toll is believed to be in the thousands.
   Romanian television broadcast a special Romanian Orthodox New
Year's Mass, celebrated by Patriarch Theocrist, to the entire
country.

   Thousands of people bearing sleeping
bags, ice chests and lawn chairs gathered Sunday, vying for a spot
along the 5{-mile route for the 101st Tournament of Roses Parade.
   Parade watchers started looking early and often for a prized
stretch of sidewalk, keeping Pasadena police officers busy shooing
them away until noon Sunday.
   After that, everything was legally up for grabs, and folks
started to stake their claims along Orange Grove and Colorado
boulevards. A few minutes after noon, every foot of the parade
route was lined with people.
   A pizza restaurant was making deliveries on the sidewalks, while
entrepreneurs were selling motor home parking spaces at every
parking lot, front lawn and driveway within eyeshot of the parade.
Some fraternity members were guarding as many as 20 folding chairs.
   The crowd gathered Sunday under clear, warm and sunny skies, but
the National Weather Service forecast a mostly cloudy New Year's
Day in Pasadena, with overnight temperatures in the low 40s,
accompanied by light winds.
   Vivian and Gary Larrick of Laverne parked their motor home near
the route and set up lawn chairs Sunday morning.
   ``The kids are going to stay here,'' said Mrs. Larrick, sitting
along Colorado Boulevard near a used car lot converted to a
campground. ``We're going to stay in the motor home. We're not
crazy.''
   The festivities that begin with the morning Rose Parade were to
continue Monday afternoon with the 76th Rose Bowl football game,
between Southern Cal and Michigan, where game time temperatures
should warm up to the low 60s, with a chance of showers at game's
end.
   About 1,100 police officers were on hand. Police last year
reported about 320 arrests before the parade, most for public
drunkenness and fighting.
   Officials in the past several years have routinely predicted 1
million visitors for the parade, and have done so again for 1990.
   Tournament officials said some 350 million television viewers
were expected to tune in worldwide as the parade is broadcast to 90
countries. The Rose Bowl game also will be broadcast live to Europe
for the first time.
   This year's parade theme was ``A World of Harmony,'' and the
marching order included 60 floats, 22 bands, and 275 equestrians,
all led by Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the grand marshal. Glenn was
one of America's first seven astronauts and the first U.S.
astronaut to orbit the Earth.

<HEAD>Polish Zloty Devalued</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Bank of Poland is devaluing
the Polish zloty by 32 percent, Polish media reported Sunday, in
another step aimed at making the currency convertible and improving
trade prospects.
   Until now, the zloty could not be used for international
transactions because it is not convertible to other currencies.
   Polish radio said Sunday that the new official exchange rate set
by the bank will be 9,500 zlotys to $1 as of Monday. Banks and
exchange offices are closed on New Year's Day.
   It was the largest devaluation since Parliament approved the
non-Communist government in September. The zloty has been devalued
12 times since then.
   The government is supporting the effort to reduce the gap
between the official rate of the zloty and a legal, though
unofficial rate available to all citizens.
   On Saturday, the unofficial rate legalized earlier this year,
which reflects the former black market rate, hovered at about 9,000
zlotys to $1.
   The government previously announced it hoped the zloty would be
completely convertible by Monday, but Finance Ministry officials
explained last week that the unofficial rate will still exist.
However, the government intends to try to keep the gap between the
two rates to a minimum through bank intervention.
   Creation of covertibility of the zloty has been a centerpiece of
economic legislation passed by both houses of Parliament last week.
   The devaluation also occurs before major price hikes expected
Monday.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 70,000 revelers welcomed the new year in
Trafalgar Square with dancing, singing, drinking and frolicking
that left at least 114 people injured, police said.
   Two people were rushed to the hospital from the central London
square, one with a suspected fractured skull and another with a
heart attack, police said.
   Police arrested 36 people for public order offenses, mainly
drunken and disorderly behavior, a spokeswoman said on condition of
anonymity.
   The turnout was one of the largest since violent New Year's
revels in 1983, attended by more than 100,000 people, police said.
Two women were trampled to death that year in a surging crowd in
the square.
   The midnight signal from the Big Ben clocktower overlooking the
Houses of Parliament by the River Thames was barely audible half a
mile away in noisy Trafalgar Square, the traditional focal point of
celebrations in the British capital.
   Many revelers only realized the 1990s had arrived when a huge
electronic sign suspended from Nelson's Column flashed the message
``A Happy New Year.''
   Crowd-control barriers were erected around the column, a
145-foot monument to the British naval hero Horatio Nelson which
dominates the square.
   Several hundred policemen were deployed in and around the
square. Its two fountains were switched off and boarded up, nearby
roads were closed to traffic and police confiscated bottles and
cans of liquor at entrance points to the square.
   Scotland Yard police headquarters said security had been the
same as in previous years. The aim was to allow people to have ``a
happy but law-abiding time,'' a spokesman said.
   Rock fans in Eastern Europe were scheduled to hear Ireland's top
international rock band U2 in a live broadcast from Dublin.
   The U2 New Year's Eve show had been scheduled for European
Community-wide radio coverage, but arrangements were made to air
the show in the Soviet Union, East Germany, Hungary, Yugoslavia and
Czechoslovakia.

   Two cars collided on a West Texas highway
Sunday, killing seven people, police said.
   The crash occurred on U.S. Highway 67 about 27 miles south of
Marfa when a vehicle carrying one man crossed the center line and
struck the other vehicle, which was carrying six people, said
Department of Public Safety Trooper Mark Riordan.
   The identities of four of the victims were withheld until
relatives could be notified. The others, all occupants of the
second car, were identified as Richard L. Armendariez, 29, Noe
Armendariez Molinar, 27, and Vanessa Armendariez, 8. All were from
Rankin, but their relationship was not immediately known, police
said.
   ``I would have to say this is probably the worst collision since
the bus crash,'' Riordan said, referring to the September school
bus crash in Alton, Texas, that killed 21 students.
   In Flagstaff, Ariz., fog and ice were blamed for Saturday's
62-vehicle chain pileup that killed six people, injured 34 and kept
sections of Interstate 40 closed for 17 hours.
   Twenty-four people remained hospitalized Sunday, four in
critical condition, authorities said.

<HEAD>Suspected Leader of Drug Death Squads Arrested</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chief of the death squads organized
by the Medellin cocaine cartel was arrested at a police roadblock
in central Colombia, authorities said Sunday.
   Elsewhere, battles between leftist guerrillas and security
forces left eight rebels and four soldiers dead, radio reports said.
   In other violence, a bomb exploded early Sunday in Bogota,
destroying two cars, the national police said in a statement. No
one claimed responsibility for the attack.
   The latest drug-trafficking suspect to be arrested was Jose
Manuel Cruz Aguirre, chief of the Medellin cartel's right-wing
death squads, who is wanted in Peru, the Administrative Security
police said in a separate communique.
   Aguirre was arrested Friday night on a highway about 35 miles
south of Bogota, the security police said. There were no immediate
details on what charges he faces.
   Death squads financed by drug traffickers have killed scores of
peasants suspected of sympathizing with leftist guerrillas, who
have tried to extort cattle ranchers in areas where traffickers
hold property.
   The death squads also have killed about 740 members of the
country's biggest leftist political party, the Patriotic Union,
presumably because the party has the support of the country's
estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas.
   Aguirre also was part owner of one of Colombia's professional
soccer teams, Deportes Tolima, the security police said. Colombian
authorities have claimed for years that drug bosses are among
owners of several professional soccer teams in Colombia.
   Aguirre was the third purported member of the Medellin cartel
arrested in four days. The others were Jose Antonio Ocampo Obando
and Camilo Antonio Ruiz Vega.
   Ocampo Obando, arrested Friday, is considered by Colombian
authorities to be the fifth most important member of the Medellin
cartel. He is wanted for extradition by the United States, police
said last week.
   Ruiz Vega was a top confidant of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the
No. 2 leader of the Medellin Cartel who was killed by police Dec.
15.
   On Saturday, police confiscated a 25,000-acre ranch belonging to
Rodriguez Gacha in the central state of Tolima, the security police
also said in their communique Sunday.
   The biggest battle between guerrillas and the army was Saturday
near the Caribbean coastal town of Turbo, the Defense Ministry said.
   Six guerrillas of the Popular Liberation Army and two soldiers
were killed, the Colombian radio networks RCN and Caracol quoted
the military command as saying.
   Also Saturday, guerrillas from the same group ambushed an army
patrol in northeastern Colombia, the radio networks quoted the
army's 5th Brigade headquarters in Bucaramanga as saying.
   They said two guerillas and two soldiers were killed.
   The People's Liberation Army is one of six guerrilla groups in
Colombia and claims it adheres to Maoist Chinese doctrine.

   Moslem bandits released a French
missionary and his niece on New Years Eve, a day after they were
kidnapped in the lawless southern Philippines, officials said
Monday.
   The Rev. Michel de Gigord and his 29-year-old niece, Benedict,
were freed unharmed Sunday night after negotiations between the
kidnappers and local officials, military and civilian authorities
said.
   They were handed over to Roman Catholic officials and were
expected to leave for France as soon as possible.
   The two were abducted by six armed men Saturday after leaving
Saint Mary's Convent in Marawi, 510 miles southeast of Manila.
   The incident occurred in a lawless region where hundreds of
people have been kidnapped in recent years. Official records show
no one has ever been convicted in any of the kidnappings despite
government promises to restore law and order.

   Talk and game show host Pat Sajak married
former Playboy model Lesly Brown in a private ceremony Sunday.
   Sajak, 42, married Brown, 24, in a 40-minute ceremony at St.
Mary's Roman Catholic Church as about 10 police officers stood
guard outside.
   Information about the ceremony was sketchy because the couple
sold exclusive rights to the nuptials to People magazine.
   Brown is a University of Maryland graduate and former ``Miss
Georgetown'' who appeared in Playboy magazine's 1988 ``Women of
Washington'' feature.
   She met the host of ``The Pat Sajak Show'' and ``Wheel of
Fortune'' at the celebrity opening of a restaurant in Irvine,
Calif., in 1988.
   Few celebrities were counted among the 100-150 guests, but
Sajak's wheel turner and close friend, Vanna White, was spotted
dodging from the church.

<HEAD>State Inspectors Check Colorado Ski Lift</HEAD>

   Inspectors were at an Aspen ski resort
Sunday to determine why a chairlift slid 35 feet backward, causing
five skiers to fall or jump to the ground and leaving 200 others
stranded.
   A 14-year-old Evergreen girl broke her back in Saturday's
accident at the Buttermilk ski resort and remained hospitalized,
authorities said.
   Four people were treated for minor injuries. Three of the
stranded skiers were treated for hypothermia and released.
   The cable on the mile-long lift slid 35 feet in eight seconds
before an emergency brake caught hold, Aspen Skiing Co. officials
said.
   Some of the stranded skiers were stuck aloft for up to two hours
as ski patrol members evacuated the lift, using ladders and a T-bar
attached to a hand-held rope, officials said.
   Resort officials did not know how far the skiers fell because
the height varies as the chair moves up the mountain. They said
none of the drops was major.
   It was the first chairlift accident at Buttermilk since the ski
area opened in 1958, said Terri Hart-Roberts, an Aspen Skiing Co.
spokeswoman. The lift, built and installed in 1969 by Herron Poma,
is a fixed-grip chairlift, a common design in which each chair is
permanently attached to the lift cable.

<HEAD>Help Wanted Index Falls, Shows Weakening Labor Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   A widely watched measure of the labor market
sent out weak signals in November, a business research group said
in a report for release today.
   The Conference Board said its Help-Wanted Index dropped six
points in November, erasing almost all of October's five-point gain.
   The seasonally adjusted index fell to 145 in November from
October's 151 and September's 146. The November reading was 11
points lower than the year- earlier level.
   ``As the decade ends, the economy is not now growing fast enough
to keep up with the rise in the working-age population,''
Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said. ``Consequently, new
entrants, or re-entrants, to the work force spend a little more
time finding jobs,'' he said.
   ``Clearly, this is a weakened labor market but not a declining
one,'' he said, noting that the U.S. unemployment rate probably
will edge up in 1990.
   The jobless rate was 5.4 percent in November, up from 5.3
percent in October and the same as in November of 1988. Goldstein
said the rate may rise to 5.8 percent by June.
   Job advertising volume fell in seven of the nine regions of the
country measured by the New York-based research group. Only the
East South Central and Mountain regions showed increases while New
England continued to be the weakest as it has been for several
months.
   The Help-Wanted Index is based on ad volume in 51 major
newspapers across the country. The Conference Board says ad volume
has proven to be sensitive to labor market conditions and provides
a gauge of change in the supply of jobs.

<HEAD>Money Magazine Says Small Investors' Holdings Grew 200 Percent in
1980s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investment portfolio of the average small
investor tripled in the 1980s, aided by the booming stock market,
according to an index compiled by Money magazine.
   The magazine said its Small Investor Index grew 200.5 percent
during the decade.
   At that rate, holdings worth $14,791 on Dec. 31, 1979, grew by
the end of 1989 to $44,439, which the magazine says is the size of
the typical individual investor's portfolio today. The index
assumes that all earnings were reinvested.
   The gain for the decade was equivalent to an 11.6 percent annual
return, compared with a 6 percent return during the 1970s, Money
said. After inflation, which averaged 5.1 percent a year in the
1980s, investors saw real annual profits of 6.5 percent. During the
1970s, they actually lost 1.3 percent a year after inflation, the
magazine says.
   The growth of investment portfolios in the 1980s resulted
primarily from the longest bull market in stocks since the 1950s,
Money says.
   Small investors also benefitted from the boom in money-market
mutual funds, which allowed them to earn two to four percentage
points more on their cash than in the 1970s, when they generally
kept cash in low-yielding passbook savings accounts.
   For 1989, small investors saw their portfolios increase by 14.5
percent on average, according to the Money index. Again, much of
the increase was due to the runup in stocks.
