   Four-term socialist Mayor Bernard Sanders'
party won another victory Tuesday, as former community development
director Peter Clavelle defeated Alderman Nancy Chioffi to become
Sanders' successor.
   Clavelle, the Progressive Coalition candidate, had 5,626 ballots,
or 52 percent of the vote, to 4,400, or 41 percent, for Democrat
Chioffi, a store owner who also had Republican backing, according to
unofficial results.
   Sanders _ often billed as the nation's only socialist mayor _ had
decided against another term. Clavelle shies away from the socialist
label, but ran under the banner of Sanders' party.
   ``Today was a referendum on Progressive government, and we won
it,'' Clavelle told a throng of 150 supporters. He said he would
continue to push most of Sanders' platform, which includes
affordable housing and public access to the Lake Champlain
waterfront.
   Also in the race were Greens party candidate Sandra Baird and
``tax revolt'' candidate Michael Hackett. Baird received 596 votes,
or 5 percent, and Hackett 91, or slightly less than 1 percent.
   Cold weather, which brought the wind chill factor to 43 degrees
below zero Tuesday morning, may have kept some of the city's 25,000
registered voters away from the ballot box. Jo Lamarche, secretary
to City Clerk James Rader, said turnout was below average in the
city of 38,000.
   The Progressives' success once again deprives the Democratic
Party of the mayor's seat, which Democrats have not held since
Sanders beat longtime incumbent Gordon Paquette by 10 votes in 1981.
   Sanders said the win was significant because it showed the
Progressives' strength.
   ``It's not a one-man show, it's a movement,'' he said. ``That's
what we've accomplished tonight.''
   He said American voters have been demoralized by the political
process.
   ``People look to the Democratic Party, they don't see anything.
They look to the Republicans, and they don't see anything. There is
one city in America that has said we can go beyond staus quo
politics, we can talk real issues to the people, we can have a dream
of a city and a state and county that is fundamentally different
than it is now,'' Sanders said.
   The 47-year-old mayor, who is known for railing against the rich
and powerful, decided in the fall to leave politics to teach and
write.
   With a promise to fight for the underdog, the Brooklyn, N.Y.,
native was elected in 1981 by 10 votes over a Democrat. He was
re-elected three times by more comfortable margins, winning in 1987
with 6,901 votes to 5,594 votes.
   Even Sanders' critics give him credit for reinvigorating city
politics. U.S. News and World Report rated him in 1987 as one of the
nation's 20 best mayors. Burlington has prospered and has been
ranked highly in national quality-of-life surveys.
   Elsewhere around Vermont it was Town Meeting Day, and residents
braved the cold to travel to their town halls and approve school
budgets and socialize with friends and neighbors not seen for a year.
   In nearly 70 towns, residents voted on a non-binding resolution
asking the Legislature to reinstate the death penalty, last used in
the 1950s. At least 45 towns supported capital punishment, but 18
rejected or tabled it. One town that voted down the resolution cited
the recent film, ``The Thin Blue Line,'' which suggests that an
innocent man faced the death penalty in Texas.
   Two years ago, about 30 towns took up the question, and
two-thirds voted for reinstatement, said Republican Rep. Nancy
Sheltra, a proponent of capital punishment and major force behind
the town meeting resolution.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday dismissed charges against
half of the 14 defendants in a massive, mob-linked drug conspiracy
trial, finding prosecutors failed to prove their case because of
``ineptitude.''
   ``If these drug dealers are walking free it's because you people
are not competent,'' U.S. District Judge John Sprizzo told
protesting prosecutors as he dismissed narcotics conspiracy charges
against seven defendants in the Pizza Connection II drug trial.
   ``You let them go,'' Sprizzo told prosecutors later in the day.
``Don't lay at my feet your ineptitude.''
   The judge then barred lawyers from talking to reporters about the
case.
   Sprizzo dropped the drug conspiracy charge after the government
finished presenting its case and defense lawyers, contending the
charge was too broad, made routine requests for the dismissal of
charges for lack of evidence.
   The trial, which began last October, is a spinoff from the
original, 17-month-long Pizza Connection drug trial, so named
because prosecutors accused the defendants of using pizzerias in the
Midwest and Northeast as fronts for their heroin dealing and
money-laundering conspiracy.
   Eighteen of the 19 defendants in the first Pizza Connection trial
were convicted.
   The 14 defendants in the Pizza Connection II case were accused of
participating in a massive conspiracy to distribute heroin, cocaine
and marijuana. Some also were charged with possession of drugs with
intent to distribute.
   The seven remaining defendants face maxiumum penalties of life in
prison if convicted.

   Jesse Jackson fasted for three days because he
hungers for the defeat of Democratic mayoral nominee Richard M.
Daley, but some Democrats say Jackson's efforts are straining the
two-time Democratic presidential contender's party credentials.
   ``What kind of credibility does that give Jackson nationwide with
other Democrats?'' asks Illinois party Chairman Vince Demuzio.
``This is certainly not going to bode well for Jackson nationally if
he has any future ambitions, which I'm sure he does.''
   Jackson backed Mayor Eugene Sawyer in the Democratic primary won
last week by Daley, but that was because his candidate of choice _
Democratic Alderman Timothy Evans _ sat out the primary in favor of
a third-party bid in the April 4 general election.
   The attack on Jackson's party credentials is only the latest
event in what has become an imbroglio in the politics of Chicago's
black community since Harold Washington, the city's first black
mayor, died near the start of his second term in 1987.
   Jackson has tried to be a peacemaker, but his plea for unity
among supporters of Sawyer and Evans during the primary went
unheeded. Now his position is at odds with the man Jackson
successfully backed to head the Democratic National Committee.
   Ron Brown, the first black to hold the top post, has announced
his support of Daley, said Mike McCurry, spokesman for the DNC in
Washington.
   To top it off, Republicans have taken note of the black split in
Chicago and some see it as playing into the hands of new Republican
National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, who is trying to lure
disenchanted blacks to the GOP.
   Jackson says he is unfazed.
   ``In these contests, sometimes you win the votes and sometimes
you don't, but you must always preserve your dignity,'' he said
Monday in a telephone interview while enroute from Tuskegee to
Montgomery, Ala.
   ``What that Democratic machine represents is a violation of
people,'' Jackson said of what he thinks would be a closed
Democratic party under Daley. ``It strips them of their dignity.''
   Daley denies that he represents the past or the politics of his
father, the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, who ran a vast patronage
army. Young Daley talks, as do others, of unifying the city and
giving all people opportunities.
   Jackson identifies the issue in his support of Evans, running on
the Harold Washington Party ticket, as ``reciprocity,'' meaning he
won't support those who haven't supported him.
   U.S. Rep. Marty Russo, D-Ill., a Daley ally who has criticized
Jackson's opposition to the Democratic mayoral nominee, received a
letter from Jackson that requested a meeting, Jackson spokesman
Frank Watkins said later Monday.
   ``If you are serious about unity in the Democratic Party, I am
perfectly willing to meet with you and Richard Daley to discuss a
similar deal,'' said the letter drafted by Watkins. ``If I do run
(for president) in 1992 will you support my candidacy as a favorite
son? That is the basis of a reciprocal deal.''
   Watkins said the letter was ``kind of a rhetorical device.''
   ``He's really not willing to talk to Daley,'' Watkins said.
``Rev. Jackson is supporting Tim Evans.''
   Jackson backed a slate of Democratic Cook County candidates last
year, including Daley in his successful bid for a third term as
county state's attorney. But he notes Daley didn't support him in
his 1988 presidential bid and didn't endorse Washington in 1987.
   ``I reached out to Daley and endorsed him, and yet he seems to
have no sense of obligation to be reciprocal or fair,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson denies that race is the only issue, although Daley is
white and Evans is black. He says the issue is one of ``going
forward'' instead of backwards.
   ``In Daley, there is relief for those who have a history of
monopolizing; grief for those who've been locked out,'' Jackson said
Saturday at an Operation PUSH meeting where he also announced his
three-day fast. Jackson, who was taking only liquids, planned to
return to a normal diet on Tuesday.
   A mostly white coalition of aldermen elected Sawyer over Evans a
week after Washington died and many Evans supporters sat out last
week's primary. Sawyer got about half the votes Washington did from
the city's 19 predominately black wards.
   Some political analysts say Jackson's run against the party's
endorsed candidate in Chicago will have little bearing on his
national standing.
   ``It will certainly be used against him, but I think Chicago
politics is seen as .. a unique situation,'' Thomas Cavanagh
director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for the Study of
American Government in Washington, said Monday. ``People who like
what he stands for probably won't care if he endorses the
(Democratic mayoral) nominee or not.''

<HEAD>Kennedy Says Time Ripe For Democrats To Seize Ideological Initiative</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy said Monday the
Republican Party is ``succumbing to the delusion'' that the old ways
will still work, opening the door for Democrats to regain the
ideological initiative.
   ``It is time for Democrats to become once again the party of
ideas,'' the Massachusetts Democrat said in a lecture at Yale
University. ``Our opportunity now _ our responsibility _ is to ...
to put forth a vision for the 1990s and beyond.''
   The 1988 election, which he said was ``so apparently devoid of
ideas,'' also revealed how important they are. The Republicans
succeeded in defining the contest because ``there was no compelling
Democratic message,'' he said.
   ``Competency was not enough,'' he said in a reference to the
failed presidential campaign of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
``Ideology, which is about ideas, was missing, and our opponents
filled the gap....''
   ``If you don't define yourself, your opponent will. That is very
dangerous in life and devasting in politics,'' Kennedy said at a
news conference after his speech. ``The Republicans were able to
define both Governor Dukakis and the Democratic Party in a way I
didn't recognize.''
   The senator said the Democrats are now presented with a great
opportunity because ``this Republican president _ and perhaps the
Republican Party _ have run out of ideas.''
   ``The administraion has no agenda other than coping, no real
budget, no major initiatives and very little to say about what
George Bush calls `the vision thing,'' Kennedy said.
   ``The administration holds office, but doesn't know what to do
with it,'' he said.
   Kennedy said the Republican Party ``can't live permanently off
the legacy of Ronald Reagan any more than Democrats can succeed by
simply repeating Franklin Roosevelt or John Kennedy.
   ``The other side is now succumbing to the delusion that did so
much demage to Democrats in other days: They assume that old ways
will continue to work, that they don't have to rethink them, that
they have won and will win if only they rerun the campaigns of the
past.''

<TEXT>
   A slumping economy is sending Norwegians on
bargain hunts in junk shops and second-hand stores.
   When North Sea oil wealth flowed, Norwegians spent freely in an
economy that quickly became overheated, but the boom came to an
abrupt end two years ago when oil prices plunged.
   ``Business is booming,'' said Leon Andersen, who runs a Salvation
Army shop in the city of Stavanger. ``It's better than ever. So far
this year sales are up 30 percent compared to last year.
   ``People come here looking for everything from used clothes to
furniture. They're being more careful with their money.
   ``We just may run out of used merchandise. People seem to be
holding onto their things. They make do with an old couch for
another year or use an old dress another season.''
   Stavanger, the nation's oil capital on the west coast, was
hardest hit by the collapse of oil prices in 1986, but the drop in
national income has squeezed the whole country.
   With its offshore oil fields pumping 1.44 million barrels a day,
lower crude prices quickly chilled Norway's overheated economy.
   Tough measures, including legislated wage controls, have helped
reduce inflation and the trade deficit. But unemployment doubled in
the last year to 4 percent, the highest since the 1930s, and
thousands of businesses went broke.
   The government decisions, combined with a modest recovery of oil
prices, hold out promise for the future, but it may take time before
it is felt in the household budget.
   ``Many Norwegians may be willing to lower their standards a
little compared to 1986,'' said Oddbjoern Eiden, an economist for
the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry.
   He said consumer spending declined 1.6 percent in 1988 after
dropping 2.7 percent in 1987. In 1986, the peak of the oil boom and
spending spiral, consumption leaped 5.7 percent.
   ``It's hard to say why people would buy more used merchandise,''
said Oddbjoern Knutsen of the state Institude of Social Research. He
said it was possible that Norwegians were simply returning to a
normal state of affairs.
   ``I don't think the spending spree of mid-1980s was typical. Oil
resulted in an economic growth that was without equal in the West.
And people spent money freely,'' he said.
   ``It's more typical of Norwegians to be careful with money. If
they are indeed buying more used things and not discarding as much,
then it seems we are returning to the cautious ways of the 1950s and
1960s, when Norway was not a rich nation.''
   Arne Johansen, who works for Oslo's five-store Elevator thrift
shops, said he noticed an upswing in sales just after the economic
slump began.
   ``We haven't noticed much of an increase since 1987 at any of our
stores individually. Sales are pretty stable. But a lot more used
merchandise shops have opened in Oslo during the past year or two,''
he said.
   ``Business is up,'' said Willy Olsen, who has owned Oslo's
Willy's Used Merchandise for 22 years. ``But a lot of new stores
have opened. There must be 10 that opened in the past two years.''
   Twenty-nine thrift shops are listed in the telephone book for
Oslo, a city of 425,000.

   Communist rebels have established a
shadow government and are collecting taxes in this northern town
named for the family of Ferdinand Marcos _ a fierce anti-Communist
during his 20-year rule.
   Local military and civilian officials say this town of 12,000
people that is 230 miles north of Manila became a rebel stronghold
after the former president fled to Hawaii in the 1986
military-civilian uprising that propelled Corazon Aquino to power.
   ``In the time of Marcos, they were only in the mountains,'' Mayor
Felicito Tamayo said of the rebel New People's Army. ``Now they have
been able to reverse that. It's as if the timing was great _
Communists entering and Marcos leaving.''
   Marcos town is about 10 miles south of Sarrat, where the former
president was born 71 years ago. The town's 13 outlying hamlets,
most named for members of Marcos' family, have become gateways for
guerrillas to slip down from the mountains into populous areas of
Ilocos Norte province.
   ``They just pass through,'' said Melecio Duldulao, 45, chief of
the hamlet of Imelda, named for Marcos' wife. ``Occasionally, when
they come at lunchtime, we ask them to join us. But that's all.''
   Tamayo said the rebels have killed civilians, seized private
property for their ``revolutionary agrarian reform'' and have forced
businesses to pay protection money, or what they call
``revolutionary taxes.''
   On March 1, army troops raided a 14-acre rebel training camp less
than two miles from the town. The camp, which was abandoned,
contained obstacle courses and a makeshift clinic.
   Tamayo said the rebel activity has created a climate of fear in
the town which civilian and military officials appear powerless to
stop.
   ``By 6 p.m., you should have already eaten and gone home,''
Tamayo said. ``Then make sure all the windows are closed.''
   Townspeople say they try to remain neutral in the conflict but
find themselves increasingly drawn into the cycle of violence.
   ``Cory arrived and the New People's Army arrived,'' said Helen
Abrigado, wife of a town official. ``We are really having a hard
time. We are afraid. If we see the (rebels), we get scared. When we
see the military we also get scared.''
   Duldulao said the rebels began infilrating his hamlet, about a
mile east of the town center, in 1984. Four years later, they killed
Artemio Manguma, leader of the village security volunteers and a
suspected military informant, he said.
   Several months later, rebels tied up Duldulao in front of his
eight children but released him after his wife, Milagros, convinced
them he had no links to the military.
   ``They have organized in the (village) level,'' said Brig. Gen.
Bayani Fabic, northern Luzon commander. ``They have organized
economic committees and are already collecting taxes.''
   The army's 45th Infantry Battalion operates in the area, and
Fabic has stepped up intelligence-gathering operations against the
shadow governments, which he considers the principal threat.
   ``To us, the armed component is easy to control,'' Fabic said,
referring to armed guerrillas. ``But to uproot the political
structure of the shadow government, that is a very tedious process.''
   Rev. Rock Bonoan, a spokesman for Roman Catholic archdiocese,
said the church plays a leading role in mediating between the
military and the rebels. He said priests often must defend
parishioners accused by the military of sympathizing with the
rebels, whose insurgency is 20 years old.
   ``Most of them are victims in this war,'' Bonoan said. ``People
are branded Communist rebels even before they become one.''
   Last May, gunmen who Bonoan said were believed to be soldiers
massacred a family of five in the nearby town of Vintar. No one was
arrested, he said.
   ``That has added to the people's dissatisfaction and
demoralization with the government,'' Bonoan said. ``They have lost
confidence in the government.''

   Residents left high and dry when this town's

   Others among the 50 or so Wash-Out customers travel 30 miles to
do their laundry in other towns.
   ``I feel very badly if someone has to travel 32 miles to do a
load of laundry,'' said Virginia Pierce of the state Department of
Natural Resources. ``On the other hand, I would feel a lot worse if
someone contracted a disease that terminated their life.''
   Authorities said Wash-Out's owner, Dennis Morse Jr., used to
allow waste water into a sewer near a neighboring nursing home. But
he was told last year the state agency would not renew its permit if
the laundry continued to dump water there.
   ``They're going to have to change the law, because if they don't,
you're not going to see a Laundromat in a small town,'' said Morse,
who closed his 13-year-old business recently.

<HEAD>Chinese Pupils Better Than Americans At Math</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese primary school pupils are far better at
mathematics than American youngsters and are more organized and
attentive in their studies, a study by experts from the two
countries indicates.
   The study by the Chinese Academy of Science and the University of
Michigan surveyed pupils in 20 Chicago schools and 11 Beijing
schools, the official Xinhua News Agency reported today.
   Professor Fang Ge of the Chinese academy's Institute of
Psychology said in a report on the study that said one reason the
Chinese outshined the Americans was that American textbooks teach
less about fractions, ratios, proportion and decimals than Chinese
textbooks.
   She also said Chinese teachers spend more time on math, and that
general math concepts are taught earlier in Chinese than American
schools.
   Ms. Fang noted that American children spend half their class time
without leadership ``and are more likely to be engaged in
inappropriate activities than Chinese students.''
   American students spent less than half the time on assigned tasks
as Chinese children, and American children pay less attention to
their teachers, the paper quoted her as saying.
   Ms. Fang added that Chinese children may be under greater social
pressure to succeed because passing national examinations to get
into good schools is directly related to their future jobs.
   The report did not provide figures on how the two groups scored
in the math tests.

<HEAD>Rats Flourish In Britain's Mild Winter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wintertime, and the living is easy in the kingdom
of Rattus norvegicus, the common brown rat which has become
uncommonly numerous around Britain.
   Complaints about rats are up as much as 70 percent in parts of
London, which has had just a touch of slush during a very mild
winter. Similar increases have been reported in Bristol, Manchester
and other large cities.
   ``I've never, never known such a year,'' said Stuart Slater,
chief environmental services officer of Babergh District Council
northeast of London. ``I haven't had a Saturday off since the end of
November.''
   Norman Foster, health officer for the Mid-Suffolk Council, said
he received 1,323 rat complaints last winter. This year, he had
matched that total by late December _ before winter had officially
begun.
   Rentokil, one of Britain's largest exterminators, has doubled its
sales of poisons this winter, said Peter Bateman, the company's
director of public relations.
   With the increase in rats, there has been a growing concern about
Weil's disease, which is spread by rat urine in water. The ailment
used to be seen mostly in miners and sewer workers, but cases have
cropped up among water skiers and canoeists.
   The reasons for the rat's prosperity are various.
   ``We've had mild winters before, without having more rats,'' said
Graham Twigg, retired senior lecturer in Zoology at Royal Holloway
College at the University of London and author of scholarly books on
vermin.
   ``Certainly in towns, one aspect of it is the lack of good
hygiene,'' said Twigg, who has done research on rats in coal mines
and Caribbean canefields.
   ``It's one of those things, a general lack of attention. This
country is pretty scruffy,'' he said.
   Hilary King, spokeswoman for the Institution of Environmental
Officers, said decaying Victorian sewage systems in big cities have
contributed to the problem. She also blamed the illegal dumping of
garbage, and the spread of fast-food restaurants.
   Efforts to poison rats have been frustrated by the rich menu of
trash and debris, especially from fast-food restaurants, said Angela
Moon, environmental health officer for the borough of Lambeth in
south London.
   ``They would rather eat that than our poison,'' she said.
   The sewers, at least, have their defenders.
   ``There have been a lot of stories around recently, a story which
comes up year after year after year, that rat populations are
increasing and sewers are decaying. I just say: prove it,'' said
Brigette Daniels, spokeswoman for Thames Water, which is responsible
for a thousand miles of sewers in and around London.
   If there are more rats about, she said, ``we believe they are
above-ground rats.''
   In Bristol, an industrial city in western England, the sewers are
taking the blame without dispute.
   ``The sewers are crumbling because of lack of upkeep, and the
rats are finding it increasingly easy to get out,'' said Peter
Archer, Bristol's assistant chief environmental health officer.
   ``Also, there is a great deal of redevelopment going on, and if
the drains are not properly sealed when the old buildings are
knocked down the rats can find their way up them and appear, to
everyone's horror, on the nice piece of landscaped garden outside
the gleaming new office blocks.''
   Archer said his rat-control budget has not been increased in
three years, and nine of 54 positions in his department are vacant.
   ``We can control rats in two ways _ by blocking up the holes in
the sewers so that they cannot get out, and by poisoning them. We
want to do both, but the government's spending limits mean that we
cannot do either properly,'' he said.
   Twigg dismissed stories in the tabloid press which have claimed
that a ``super rat'' has emerged from the sewers.
   He recalled coal miners telling him about big rats, rats big
enough to enter in a dog show, and the sage insight of one miner:
``No one ever sees a small rat.''

   The furor over Salman Rushdie's novel ``The
Satanic Verses'' highlights a gulf between Western Europe and its
Moslem minorities. Here is a report from an English city with a
large Moslem community.

<TEXT>
   Bradford's Moslems invited Eric Pickles,
leader of the city council, to a public burning of ``The Satanic
Verses'' and were surprised when he refused.
   The incident illustrates the gap Salman Rushdie's novel opened
between Western Europe and its minority Moslems _ between men like
Sher Azam, spiritual leader of Bradford's 60,000 Moslems, and
Pickles, the Anglo-Saxon businessman to whom he extended the
invitation.
   Azam, born in Pakistan 48 years ago, was equally offended by
British outrage at the book-burning.
   ``We were left with even more hurt and frustration,'' he said.
``The publicity we got was that Moslems are doing something not in
line with British culture and tradition.''
   Pickles, 36, said: ``They were genuinely surprised I wouldn't go.
That burning book brought back all kinds of images of repression, in
particular Nazi Germany in the '30s. ... It's an obscene act.''
   The protest Jan. 14 in this north England city of 500,000 people
was widely publicized in Moslem countries. Some analysts believe it
began the international crisis in which Iranian spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered Rushdie killed, driving the
author him into hiding.
   Outraged Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggesting he wrote the holy Koran rather than receiving it directly
from Allah.
   Like most Bradford Moslems of his generation, Azam arrived from
Pakistan in the 1950s to work in a textile mill. He now heads a
chain of Moslem-run supermarkets and is president of the Council of
Mosques, the Bradford Islamic organization.
   From book burning in Bradford to pro-Khomeini demonstrations in
Paris, the uproar over ``The Satanic Verses'' has increased the
alienation of Western Europe's 5 million Moslems.
   Officials in Ravenna, Italy, ordered increased security around a
monument to Dante Alighieri on Sunday after a group threatened to
blow it up because the medieval poet's famed ``Divine Comedy''
places the prophet Mohammed in hell.
   The main Moslem communities are Turkish immigrants in West
Germany, who have made no significant protest about Rushdie's book;
North Africans in France; and Pakistanis and Indians in Britain.
   Firebombs have been thrown at two mosques in Britain and there
are fears of a religious and racial backlash against Moslems.
   Bradford's Council of Mosques is on the edge of the Asian quarter
and has been under discreet police guard since intruders broke in
last month and left a message: ``Leave Rushdie Alone.''
   Most government and intellectual comment has focused on Rushdie's
right of free speech, but the affair has racial undertones and has
revived calls for stricter curbs on Third World immigration.
   ``It is becoming disturbingly clear that immigrants, anyhow from
Islamic countries, are going to constitute the biggest concentration
of religious fanaticism ... this country has experienced for many
centuries,'' Peregrine Worsthorne, editor of the conservative Sunday
Telegraph, wrote in a signed editorial.
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of the extreme-right National Front
in France, said the controversy reflects ``exactly what I am afraid
of for France and Europe, namely the invasion of Europe by Moslem
immigrants.''
   Conservatives like Worsthorne say British liberals are reaping
the harvest of their multicultural doctrines, which hold that ethnic
minorities should be free to preserve their cultures rather than
blending into the society.
   Commentator Auberon Waugh pointed to the irony of Rushdie
enjoying the protection of a government he has likened to a police
state and the police he has denounced as racist.
   ``He should pay for any police protection he may judge
advisable,'' Waugh wrote in the conservative weekly Spectator.
   Rushdie was born in Bombay, India, of Moslem parents but now is a
British citizen. ``The Satanic Verses'' was published in Britain
last fall.
   Liberal intellectuals, among whom Rushdie is prominent, have
united with Margaret Thatcher, the Conservative prime minister who
ordinarily is their favorite hate figure, in defense of free speech.
   The opposition Labor Party also joined it, but notes that Mrs.
Thatcher's record includes banning broadcast interviews with members
of the outlawed Irish Republican Army and spending millions on law
suits to suppress ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of a retired
intelligence agent.
   ``They (the government) are total hypocrites,'' Labor foreign
affairs spokesman Gerald Kaufman said in an interview. ``They've
spent the last several years suppressing freedom of speech in every
way they can.''
   Labor also has been accused by some of its own supporters of
pulling its punches for fear of losing Moslem votes.
   Many British Moslems consider speeches by Cabinet ministers about
democratic values and civilized behavior insensitive at best and at
worst intolerant.
   ``Those who wish to make their home in Britain, to contribute to
our society and to prosper within it, cannot deny to others the very
freedoms which drew them to this country,'' Education Secretary
Kenneth Baker said at a political meeting in Bradford.
   Liaqat Hussain, one of Azam's deputies, responded: ``They are
turning the attention of the British public against the Moslem
people.''
   Former Mayor Mohammed Ajeeb, the first non-white to run a British
city, said: ``A form of racism manifests itself in times of tension
and that's what is happening now,''
   In one view, the Rushdie affair is a power struggle between
fundamentalists and secularized Moslems. Some Islamic religious
leaders have supported Khomeini's death call and none has publicly
rejected it.
   Moderate Moslems are embarrassed and fear association with a
fundamentalist image that equates in many West European minds with
hostage-taking, airline bombings and keeping women in veils.
   Pickles said of the situation in Bradford: ``We've done all right
so far over this ... but if something happens to Mr. Rushdie, then
we could be in trouble.''

   More than 3,000 Poles have recently been
caught trying to smuggle food into Western Europe to sell at a
profit, the official PAP news agency reported.
   In one case, a Pole tried to smuggle a goat and a baby pig into
West Berlin, Zygmunt Janczyk, spokesman for the main customs office,
was quoted as saying.
   ``We will fight this negative phenomenon until it vanishes
completely,'' Janczyk was quoted as saying in the report Monday.
   PAP did not say during what period of time the offenders were
caught by customs officials.
   PAP did not say during what period of time the offenders were
turned back. Communist authorities on Jan. 1 eased procedures to
obtain passports and thousands of Poles have headed West to trade,
mainly to West Berlin or Austria where visas are not required.
   Janczyk said Poles were allowed to take enough food for their
journey, but a 300 percent customs duty is charged on any excessive
amount.
   He said some Polish passengers on a train en route to West Berlin
threw food away when they saw customs officers approach.
   Trading in the West is tempting to Poles because they can buy
goods in Poland for zlotys, sell them for hard currency in the West
and then convert that money back into zlotys at the black-market
rate for a profit.

<TEXT>
   A judge who rejected a defense lawyer's claim
of stress as the basis for a mistrial has added an attorney to help
represent ``Night Stalker'' defendant Richard Ramirez.
   Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan announced Monday he had
appointed Ray Clark as co-counsel in the serial 1985 murder case
that took six months to select a jury.
   Clark will assist Daniel Hernandez and Arturo Hernandez, no
relation, in the defense of Ramirez, 29, a drifter from El Paso,
Texas.
   Ramirez is charged with 13 slayings and 30 related felonies in a
string of nighttime attacks that terrified California in the summer
of 1985.
   Daniel Hernandez has been the lone defense attorney since last
July when Arturo Hernandez left the case without explanation. Tynan
ordered him back to court after Daniel Hernandez threw the case into
turmoil two weeks ago by reporting he was suffering from nervous
exhaustion and needed a six-week break to recuperate.

<HEAD>Report: Immigration Commissioner Alan Nelson Being Ousted</HEAD>

Commissioner Alan C. Nelson will be replaced as part of a ``major
turnover'' in the administration intended to reflect President
Bush's priorities and views, the Los Angeles Times said.
   Despite a concerted effort by Nelson to hold onto his job, the
search for his replacement is under way, the newspaper said in
Tuesday editions.
   Nelson presided over the government's massive program to give
legal status to illegal aliens.
   The report came in the wake of a recent Justice Department audit
that was highly critical of INS management practices, citing such
problems as missing documents, massive backlogs of cases and failure
to conduct background checks on many applicants for citizenship.
   In addition, Nelson has been criticized for the agency's plan to
dig a four-mile-long ditch on the Mexico-California border near San
Diego to deter smuggling.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, whose department oversees the
INS, wants to bring ``new blood'' to the agency, the Times said.
   The president indicated ``he would like to see major turnover of
people in the Administration to reflect his views and priorities,''
a Justice Department source told the Times.
   ``The attorney general has been engaged in the process of
interviewing people for major positions,'' said spokesman David
Runkel. ``No determination has been made with regard to INS.''
   No decision on a replacement is expected this month, the Times
said. Administration sources said several people have been mentioned
as possible successors to Nelson, but no front-runner has emerged.
   ``We're not in a position to confirm or deny that. To the best of
my knowledge, he has not been told that. I just talked to him,''
said Nelson's chief spokesman, Greg Leo.
   The report that Nelson was being ushered out was no surprise to
several immigrant rights activists.
   ``There are enough people out there who want him out to start a
club,'' said Mario Moreno of the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund.
   Nelson, a former San Francisco attorney who took over the job in
1982, oversaw implementation of the landmark 1986 immigration reform
law and was sharply criticized by alien advocates who said he was
slow in informing the public about the measure's provisions.

<HEAD>Milan Presents A Cozy, Sporty Look</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1989-1990 winter look _ Italian style _
is a cozy combination of soft fabrics and casual styles.
   Italy's top ready-to-wear designers, including Armani Versace,
Ferre, Krizia, Fendi, Moschino Missoni and Biagiotti, are showing
their winter wears during the five days of shows here.
   As the second day unfolded Monday, it became apparent that Milan
designers are not going to sacrifice wearability for creativity.
   Gone are the padded shoulders, frilly blouses, and short
hip-hugging skirts, to be replaced by dropped sleeves, sporty
sweaters, and lots and lots of pants.
   There are skirts as well, but except for Gianni Versace, who
shocked the fashion crowd with a miniskirt so short it barely
covered the derriere, designers opted for a classic knee length, or
a comfortable mid-calf hemline.
   Milan will always favor black, but the winter wear was also full
of bright colors and prints for both day and night.
   Its a big season for message prints as well, with such slogans as
``very expensive'' appearing on a Moschino jacket, and the word
``fog'' written on the back of a gray cashmere dress by Biagiotti.
   Then there are the usual floral prints, this time inspired by
rich velvet, geometric figures and letters, and the animal prints
championed by Krizia. This year she dedicates her collection to the
ferocious tiger, putting his stripes as well as his face and tail on
sweaters and dresses alike.
   Speaking of animals, there is a runway battle going on between
the conservationist designers, who are showing only fake furs this
season, and those who cannot abandon the luxurious feel of the real
thing.
   Thus Giorgio Armani at his Emporio collection opened with a group
of stuffed animals ranging from teddy bears to sables to introduce
his new line of synthetic fun furs. The look-alikes were fashioned
into elegant stoles and capes, full length coats, and sporty jackets.
   At the other end of the spectrum are the Fendis, who show their
new fur collection today, but who are showing off their original
ultra-light workmanship of humble skunks and squirrels as well as
lofty sable and mink, throughout the week at their downtown Milan
showrooms.
   In the accessory department, the big item is the long strand of
beads in shiny stones or gold, somewhere between a designer jewelry
rip-off and 1920's flapper beads. These beads can be worn casually
by day, or decorate an otherwise simple black evening gown. Krizia
even had strands twined around the collar of a lavish fur coat.
   Shoes this season are generally flat to go with the comfortable
look of the clothes, with a rare spiked heel for more sophisticated
evening wear.
   After a number of seasons of cropped boyish haircuts, designers
are proposing women with manes of wild curly hair. If all hair
growing lotions fail to produce the required length by October,
chief Italian fashion pranster Franco Moschino offers a solution _ a
curly blond wig, the same one the balding black mustachioed designer
wears in his present ad campaign.

   At least 25 Hindu pilgrims were reported
killed in a stampede and a separate building collapse during the
Hindu festival that celebrates the birthday of Shiva, the faith's
god of destruction.
   Twenty people died Monday near Patna, capital of Bihar state, of
suffocation during a stampede as people rushed to a shrine to
worship, The Press Trust of India news agency reported.
   Five pilgrims died at Ginar in Gujarat state in the partial
collapse of a building containing a Shiva idol, news reports said.
   Millions of Hindus across India celebrated the festival,
believing Shiva will ensure well-being.
   People rush to shrines on festival days to offer flowers in a
ritual of worship, causing periodic stampedes because idols are
normally located within enclosed spaces or rooms.

<HEAD>Drug Related Parole Violations to be Reported Sooner</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Parole Commission is tightening its
drug regulations on federal parolees who used to get up to three
chances to slip up and use drugs before the commission heard about
it.
   The previous policy ``stated that when any three violations
occurred in a 12-month period, the probation officer didn't have to
notify us until after the three violations occurred,'' said Linda
Marble, the commission's director of case operations and program
development.
   ``Now we require it immediately,'' she said Monday. ``As soon as
the first drug violation occurs, they have to notify us.'' The new
procedures are effective immediately.
   Affected by the new rules are about 12,900 people on parole and
2,500 who were required to serve their full sentences less good time
off, she said. The latter are under Parole Commission supervision
until the end of their original sentences.
   They are supervised by about 2,220 probation officers.
   ``The reason that it's so important to find out immediately if
these people are using drugs is because they commit criminal
behavior to support their drug addiction,'' Ms. Marble said.
   ``It's a very expensive habit and they have to get the money for
it somewhere,'' she said. ``Most of them don't have jobs or good
enough jobs to pay for the drugs, and it's important to get those
people off the streets to protect the public.''
   Parolees who have had a history of drug abuse ``are required to
submit to urinalysis, to participate in drug counseling sessions
and, on occasion, to be placed in an inpatient drug treatment
program,'' Ms. Marble said.
   Not all parolees found to have used drugs, missed a counseling
appointment or failed or refused to submit a urine sample would be
sent back to prison, she said.
   The commission has a range of options from returning the parolee
to prison immediately after a hearing to sending him to a
community-based drug-treatment center, she said.
   Ms. Marble estimated that 50 percent of federal prisoners are
confined for drug charges _ drug dealing to money-laundering _ but
these rules are aimed at those among them who use drugs.
   The new procedures were approved by the commission 7-0 at a Feb.
8 meeting but not announced until Monday.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Intervene in Corporal Punishment Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conflicts are sure to continue among the
nation's courts over the use of corporal punishment in public
schools due to the Supreme Court's reluctance to address the issue.
   The court on Monday refused, without comment, to review a Texas
law that permitted two kindergarten girls to be paddled severely for
snickering.
   Lawyers for the girls cited Department of Education studies
indicating that 30,000 American schoolchildren are physically
injured each year ``because of the infliction of corporal punishment
to a degree that requires medical treatment.''
   Their appeal said those studies estimate ``at least 100,000
children develop emotional and learning disabilities from excessive
and inappropriate school punishment each year.''
   The American Medical Association and the National Committee for
Prevention of Child Abuse also urged the justices to hear arguments
in the case.
   But the court left unresolved whether the Constitution affords
any protection against corporal punishment by teachers and school
administrators.
   Left intact is a Texas law that allows the use of all necessary
corporal punishment, short of deadly force.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Texas law, but
other federal appeals courts have made it easier for schoolchildren
to sue in such cases. For example, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled in a New Mexico case that ``at some degree of
excessiveness or cruelty'' such punishment violates constitutional
rights.
   The justices in 1977 ruled that public school disciplinary
measures involving physical force do not amount to ``cruel and
unusual punishment'' banned by the Constitution's Eighth Amendment.
   While the decision barred students from suing teachers and school
administrators in federal court over alleged Eighth Amendment
violations, it left them free to sue in state courts under state
laws.
   The 1977 decision left it unclear whether corporal punishment
ever may violate the Constitution's 14th Amendment that protects due
process rights.
   The case the court turned aside Monday came from Jacksonville,
Texas, where on May 6, 1987, Crystal Cunningham, 5, and Ashley
Johnson, 6, were paddled twice _ once by their school principal and
once by their teacher.
   Mary Sue Bruno, the principal at Westside Kindergarten School,
saw the two girls snickering in the hall and gave each child two
swats on the buttocks with a wooden paddle.
   When the girls returned to the classroom, teacher Rosa Cook saw
them still snickering. She took the girls into the hallway and gave
each three more swats across the buttocks with a wooden paddle.
   Each girl missed six days of school. The lawsuit filed in their
behalf said the reason for their absence was ``severe pain'' and
fear of returning to school.
   According to court documents, both girls were taken to a child
welfare office where social workers who examined the paddling
bruises said the two had been subjected to child abuse.
   The children's federal lawsuit _ dismissed by a judge _ sought
monetary damages in alleging the girls were victims of conduct that
was ``excessive, brutal, disproportionate to the circumstances (and)
shocking to the conscience.''
   In other action Monday, the Supreme Court:
   _Ruled that people accused of drunken driving usually have no
right to a jury trial if they face a jail term of no more than six
months. The court said unanimously in a Nevada case that states do
not violate fair-trial rights by treating drunken driving as a petty
offense not warranting trial by jury.
   _Rejected an appeal by Northeastern states seeking to force the
federal government to crack down on acid rain and other pollution
they say is caused by factories and power plants in other states.
   _Agreed to review the fines imposed against four Yonkers, N.Y.,
councilmen for defying a federal judge's order to adopt a housing
desegregation plan.
   _Agreed to decide in a case from Washington state whether a
prison inmate is entitled to a court hearing and other
constitutional safeguards before being forced to take anti-psychotic
drugs.

<HEAD>Crisis in Relations Drags on; Election Seen as Rigged</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With the prospect of a rigged election
perpetuating the rule of Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega,
administration officials and other experts see little hope of any
thaw in U.S.-Panamanian relations.
   Panama's ruling coalition has selected a Noriega confidant,
Carlos Duque, as the official candidate in the May 7 election, an
indication that Noriega intends to continue running the government
from behind the scenes, much as he has for the past five years.
   This is causing headaches for U.S. policy makers, who see Panama
as one of the major hemispheric issues facing the new
administration, ranking alongside debt, drug trafficking and Marxist
penetration of Central America as priority problems. A prime concern
is the continued smooth functioning of the Panama Canal.
   Almost nothing has gone right for the United States in Panama
since relations began to deteriorate in June 1987. A year ago,
administration officials confidently predicted Noriega would quickly
fall after a series of U.S. sanctions were imposed.
   But Noriega, the Defense Force commander who is under indictment
in Florida on drug smuggling charges, has survived the challenge,
leaving U.S. officials perplexed and divided on what to do next.
   Gen. Fred Woerner, the Panama-based commander of U.S. forces in
Latin America, has taken the unusual step of going public with his
concerns, suggesting that Noriega is the beneficiary of a policy
vacuum in Washington.
   There is virtually unanimous agreement among government and
outside analysts that Noriega is laying the groundwork for a
fraudulent election.
   Woerner says Noriega ``has been moving adroitly to manipulate''
the balloting against an opposition slate.
   The State Department said last month that ``it is hard to imagine
a free and fair election'' being carried out in an atmosphere of
``heavy-handed repression and intimidation.''
   A report released last week by the Puebla Institute, a lay Roman
Catholic human rights group, said Panama denies basic civil
liberties and that Noriega allies control the electoral tribunal and
voter lists and also are in charge of the balloting.
   Leslie Hunter, who wrote a portion of the report, said there is a
widespread expectation in Panama that ``these elections will be the
most fraudulent of all in a series of fraudulent elections'' in that
country.
   Carl Gershman, president of the U.S.-funded National Endowment
for Democracy, said a huge majority of Panamanians oppose Noriega
and they may be able use the election process to their advantage.
   Gershman, who returned recently from Panama, said Noriega could
be weakened politically from the process if it exposes the depth of
the sentiment against him.
   Noriega may be faced with a choice of calling off the election or
engaging in massive fraud to ensure victory, leaving him in a
difficult position both at home and internationally, Gershman said.
   Ambassador Juan Sosa, a captain of the anti-Noriega forces in
Washington, agreed that Noriega may have to confront that unhappy
choice. ``Nobody believes the election will be a solution in the
struggle,'' Sosa said.
   Sosa was appointed by ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle as
ambassador, and the United States continues to recognize both. In
February 1988, Delvalle tried to fire Noriega but instead was
deposed by Noriega's allies hours later.
   Latin American democracies have kept a diplomatic distance from
the Noriega-led government, and the United States has shunned
virtually all dealings with it.
   This has created a variety of problems for U.S. diplomats in
Panama, including obtaining such mundane items as license plates and
driver's licenses. To minimize hardship, the State Department has
sharply reduced its staff in Panama and additional cuts are under
consideration.

   Army Warrant Officer James W. Hall III feels
remorse for spying in behalf of Warsaw Pact nations and hopes for
clemency from the military judge before whom he pleaded guilty to 10
counts of espionage, his lawyer says.
   Vaughn E. Taylor, Hall's civilian counsel, said Monday that the
30-year-old New York City native is ``truly sorry for whatever
damage he may have done to national security'' and will ``throw
himself on the mercy of his military judge.''
   Under a plea agreement, Hall cannot receive the death penalty.
   Hall admitted during his court-martial Monday that he
participated between 1983 and 1988 in a conspiracy to deliver
classified military information to East Germany and the Soviet Union.
   Col. Howard C. Eggers, the military judge presiding at the
court-martial at Fort McNair in southwest Washington, will decide
whether to accept Hall's plea after hearing the prosecution's case
and defense witnesses. Court officials said the final verdict and
sentence probably would come Friday at the soonest.
   Hall, an intelligence analyst with a top-secret security
clearance, was arrested Dec. 21 near Savannah, Ga., and accused of
delivering film and documents dealing with communications
intelligence and war plans to Warsaw Pact nations.
   At the time of his arrest, Hall was assigned to the 24th Infantry
Division and worked as an intelligence analyst in the Army's G-2
intelligence section. He joined the Army in 1976 and spent most of
his career in Europe working as an analyst of intercepted radio and
telephone traffic and coded messages.
   Hall pleaded guilty under an agreement that prohibits the
government from seeking the death penalty. The maximum punishment he
could receive is life in prison, forfeiture of all pay and
allowances, dishonorable discharge and a fine.
   A still-secret part of the plea agreement outlines the sentence
that Hall will receive unless the presiding judge, who is not
permitted to see the sentencing agreement, imposes a lighter
sentence. If the judge imposes a sentence that is harsher than the
one in the agreement, the agreement will prevail.
   Hall waived his right to a grand jury-type hearing to determine
if a court-martial was warranted and agreed to be tried by a single
military judge rather than a panel of officers.
   He also agreed to submit to ``unlimited debriefing'' and
polygraph examination by government officials and to testify, if
called, at grand jury proceedings against Huseyin Yildirim, a
Turkish-born, naturalized citizen to whom Hall allegedly passed the
classified information.
   The plea agreement requires that Hall sign away any profits he
might earn in the future from any publication based on his
involvement in the espionage case.
   Taylor said through a military spokesman that he would not
comment on Hall's motivation for passing classified information
until after Hall has been questioned by Eggers during the closed
part of the court-martial.

   The first Senate Democrat to support Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower has frequently sided with Republicans
but also cast crucial votes against three of former President
Reagan's nominees.
   Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama was Reagan's most consistent
Democratic supporter in the Senate, but he played a major role in
the Senate rejection of Supreme Court nominee Robert H. Bork.
   He also cast the deciding vote in the Senate Judiciary
Committee's rejection of two other Reagan nominees, William Bradford
Reynolds for the number three post in the Justice Department and
Jefferson B. Sessions for a federal judgeship in south Alabama.
   But Heflin on Monday announced that he would break ranks with his
Democratic colleagues and support Tower's confirmation.
   ``I will rely on his pledge and give him a chance to prove
himself,'' Heflin said in a speech on the Senate floor, referring to
Tower's promise to swear off drinking if he is confirmed to head the
Pentagon.
   Heflin met privately with President Bush for 45 minutes last week
to discuss the Tower nomination. He said afterward that he believes
a president's appointments should be confirmed unless it can be
proven ``that the person is flawed or that he would be a detriment
to the country.''
   In Tower's case, Heflin said he was not convinced after reading
the FBI reports that the former Texas senator has a drinking problem
that would disqualify him from serving in the nation's top military
post.
   ``In reviewing all of the charges, I have concluded that his
conduct in many areas is not applaudable and not without justifiable
criticism, but on the other hand, not disqualifying,'' he said.
   Heflin also cited Tower's qualifications for the Pentagon post
and said that in the six years that he served with Tower in the
Senate, between 1978 and 1984, he never saw nor heard any evidence
that Tower had a drinking problem.
   Had Tower been nominated for a lifetime judgeship, Heflin might
well have voted against confirmation. But he said the since the
secretary of defense serves at the pleasure of the president, Bush
will be responsible and accountable for Tower's conduct.
   ``It is the president's cabinet,'' Heflin said, ``not Congress'
cabinet.''
   Heflin, a 67-year-old ex-Marine and former Alabama chief justice,
was widely criticized in Alabama for his opposition to both Bork and
Sessions, but neither vote appears to have caused him any lasting
political damage.
   First elected to the Senate in 1978 with more than 90 percent of
the general election vote, Heflin was re-elected in 1984 with 63
percent of the vote against a conservative GOP opponent.
   His only announced challenger in 1990 is Republican state Sen.
Bill Cabiness of Birmingham, a businessman who chaired the state's
delegation to the Republican convention that nominated Bush for
president.

<HEAD>Massive Flare from Sun Disrupts Communications, May Affect Satellites</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: May be topped.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the most intense solar flares since 1984
could still be making itself felt Wednesday by triggering the aurora
borealis and giving faulty commands to satellites.
   The massive flare erupted Monday on the eastern edge of the sun,
sending a burst of radiation that interfered with a navigation
system and some communications, federal officials said.
   Officials expected havoc early today as a result of a burst of
high-energy particles from the flare, which they said could affect
some aircraft communication and television signals.
   Forecaster Joe Kunches at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's Space Environment Services Center in Boulder,
Colo., said the flare was beyond the measuring capacity of the
agency's GOES satellites. He estimated the solar eruption was the
most powerful since April 1984.
   The flare, detected at 9:05 a.m. EST, affected the Loran
navigation system of the Coast Guard and disrupted some short-wave
radio communications.
   Gary Heckman, director of the Boulder center, said another
effect, called a geomagnetic storm, may arrive at Earth about 9 a.m.
EST Wednesday.
   A geomagnetic storm is a wave of magnetically charged particles
smashing into the Earth's magnetic field, disrupting natural
currents and triggering the aurora borealis, or northern lights.
   The storm also slightly heats the atmosphere, causing it to
expand. This, in turn, can affect the flight paths of satellites in
relatively low orbits.
   The geomagnetic storm, said Heckman, also could energize
particles trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. If these particles
hit a satellite, he said, it could cause the craft to receive stray
signals or faulty commands.
   Heckman said the flare occurred on the eastern edge of the sun,
which means that much of the radiation will not affect the Earth
directly. The same area of the sun that spawned the flare, however,
is rotating closer into view.
   ``Over the next two weeks we could more more vulnerable to more
flares,'' he said.
   The sun goes through phases of intense activity. It passed a low
point in 1986 and is now climbing toward an expected peak in
intensity later this year or early in 1990.
   A flare occurs when energy stored by the sun's magnetic fields
suddenly becomes unstable and is converted to heat and radiation
within a few minutes, Heckman said.
   He said NOAA solar telescopes recorded a flare of particles
rising some 70,000 miles from the surface of the sun.

   A lawmaker wants the state to change its
name to ``Dakota'' to project a simpler, warmer image, but one
newspaper suggests officials should take a hint from their neighbor
to the north.
   Sen. Tim Mathern is sponsoring a resolution to drop ``North''
from the state's name, a change voters would have to approve.
Supporters say ``North'' connotes a cold, harsh climate.
   Mathern told the state Congress' Joint Constitutional Revision
Committee on Monday that the adjective detracts from the word
``Dakota,'' which means ``friend'' or ``ally'' in the Sioux language.
   ``Dakota speaks to what we are most proud about, the
wholesomeness and hospitality of our people,'' he said.
   Business also would appear to support the change, said state
Tourism Director Jim Fuglie. Telephone books in North Dakota's four
largest cities list only 27 businesses with ``North Dakota'' in
their name while 233 use ``Dakota,'' he said.
   A Montana newspaper poked fun at the debate by sponsoring a
contest to suggest a better name. The winner of The Billings Gazette
contest was ``Manitscolda,'' pronounced ``Man-it's-cold-uh,'' an
apparent takeoff on North Dakota's northern neighbor, Manitoba.
   The committee took no action on the resolutions.

   Steve Crothers thought his pet
lizard was a goner until he began hearing about sightings of a
creature variously described by frightened residents as a 6-foot
alligator or a diminuitive Godzilla.
   Then he knew that Cleopatra, his 3{-foot Nile monitor lizard, was
alive and leaping.
   ``I had already supposed she was dead or someone had stolen her.
But when I heard a few months ago about this thing people were
seeing, I knew right away,'' he said.
   Animal control officers captured Cleopatra on Saturday after a
resident reported seeing the lizard.
   Crothers no longer has room in his life for the reptile, though,
so he sold the lizard to a woman for $75 on Sunday.
   ``I have a 10-month-old daughter and my wife doesn't want it
around the baby,'' he said. ``I don't have the money to go buy it a
new cage, and anyway, I can't keep pets at the apartment I have now.
It's three strikes and you're out.''

   Officials trying to reclaim city streets
from flocks of messy birds have found an unlikely ally: brightly
colored beach ball-sized balloons with huge, buggy eyes.
   ``Supposedly, they look like predators and the birds go somewhere
else,'' Mayor Ronald N. Young said.
   Flocks of blackbirds, crows and other birds have been befouling
sidewalks, cars and pedestrians in this city 45 miles west of
Baltimore.
   ``I was learning how to do the two-step real well,'' said Bonnie
Zimmerman, a secretary at city hall, which is surrounded by trees
and has received a heavy bombing from the birds.
   Advice on how to solve the potentially unsanitary problem has
been plentiful, ranging from mass poisonings to a community bird
shoot.
   Officials seeking a bloodless solution tried electronic chirping
devices and plastic owls without success. But since setting up about
two dozen of the menacing ballooons, the birds have moved along and
city workers have reclaimed park benches in front of city hall.
   ``We're crossing our fingers,'' said Robert L. Strine, the city's
director of public works. ``The short-term results appear good.''

<HEAD>Israel's Largest Peace Movement Under Attack</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's largest peace movement has come under a
new barrage of criticism from hawks and Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir is heading the attacks by questioning group members' loyalty
to their country.
   Shamir's remarks Sunday that Peace Now activists are in cahoots
with ``the most dangerous and extremist of our enemies'' triggered a
barrage of accusations and counterattacks.
   Peace Now members, like all other Israeli citizens, serve in the
armed forces and do annual reserve duty.
   ``They are sabotaging Israel's political war, the war for
Israel's security ... They are helping the most dangerous and most
extremist of our enemies,'' Shamir said.
   Tzahi Hanegbi, a member of Shamir's hard-line Likud bloc, agreed.
   ``At the height of the uprising when there are blood riots and
Jews are being murdered, they (Peace Now members) go crawling toward
the leaders of the uprising and break a rule that every
self-respecting Jew abides, which is to wait for the government's
decisions,'' Hanegbi said.
   He was referring to the actions Saturday of thousands of Peace
Now members, who tried to drive into the occupied territories to
talk peace with Palestinians. The army, which bars political
activity in the occupied areas, sealed the West Bank and turned back
activists headed to Arab villages.
   Underlying the attacks on Peace Now, however, is the group's
controversial decision several months ago to change its stand toward
the Palestine Liberation Organization _ which right-wing circles
still consider a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction
of Israel _ and call on the government to talk peace with Chairman
Yasser Arafat.
   The government refuses to negotiate with the PLO.
   Peace Now also favors territorial compromise.
   The loosely organized Peace Now does not keep membership rosters,
and therefore has no clear estimate of its popularity. But scores of
thousands of people turned up at a recent rally calling for talks
with the PLO.
   On Monday, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens urged leftist legislator
Yossi Sarid to cancel a scheduled trip to New York later this week
for a Columbia University conference with PLO officials.
   ``This is an attempt to try and influence the (Israeli)
government, not through a debate in Parliament or through
elections... but through the foreign media and foreign
governments,'' he said. ``This, to my mind, is something that should
not be done.''
   Yisrael Harel, a leader of the Gush Emunim Jewish settlement
movement in the occupied territories, has accused Peace Now of
running to talk with Palestinians while resisting talks with
right-wing Israelis.
   ``The agenda should be that first we come to a national
consensus, and then present that to the Arabs,'' Harel said.
   Shamir, meanwhile, called Peace Now ``the most marginal of
marginal elements,'' and added: ``They aren't worth the paper used
to write on about them.''
   Twenty legislators of left-wing parties and the center-left Labor
Party signed a letter to the prime minister, demanding he retract
the statements, made at a meeting of his right-wing Likud bloc.
   Peace Now activist and playwright Benny Barabash had harsh words
for Shamir, and accused him of ``starting a drive of incitement and
bloodletting.''
   He was referring to the 1983 murder of peace activist Emil
Greenzweig, killed by a fellow Israeli who hurled a hand-grenade
into an anti-war and Peace Now rally.
   Peace Now does not plan to give up its struggle.
   The movement was formed in 1978 as a pressure group to persuade
then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin to make concessions for peace
with Egypt. A peace treaty was signed the following year, with
Israel returning the entire Sinai desert captured in 1967.
   Movement leaders feel the 15-month-old Palestinian uprising has
created an historic opportunity for another peace settlement in the
region.
   ``It's our job to prepare people's hearts for compromise,''
Barabash said.
   Some 399 Arabs and 17 Israelis have been killed in the
Palestinian revolt against Israel's 21-year occupation of the Gaza
Strip and West Bank.

<TEXT>
   That green stuff you see the next time you
open the refrigerator might not be last week's meatloaf.
   Reynolds Metals Co., the people who brought you Reynolds Wrap and
Reynolds Plastic Wrap, has introduced colored plastic wrap.
   The clear, clingy stuff will now be available in red, blue,
yellow and yes, green.
   The company's advertising says the new wrap, which costs the same
as its clear counterpart, ``makes the mundane task of wrapping
leftovers fun.''
   ``The addition of color gives an emotional appeal to plastic
wrap, which in its clear form is considered purely a functional
product,'' said Reynolds brand manager Jane D. Nims.
   Marabel Morgan, author of ``The Total Woman,'' who has advocated
that women add excitement their marriages by greeting their husbands
at the door wearing only in plastic wrap, says the colored wrap ``is
a great idea. It would really add a lot of zip,'' she said in a
telephone interview from her home in Miami.
   Crystal Color Plastic Wrap generated lots of enthusiasm in focus
groups and simulated test markets, said Anne F. Waring, a
spokeswoman for Reynolds' consumer products division.
   ``Adding color to plastic wrap makes a useful product exciting,''
she said, noting that the same thing has been done to paper clips
and rubber bands.
   The company will promote use of the colored wrap in crafts as
well as food storage, Ms. Waring said Monday, and will have several
special promotions around the holidays.
   Ms. Waring declined to speculate on the impact the colored wrap
might have on sales or how much the new product, which has been in
the works three to fours years, cost to develop.
   The consumer products division accounts for 10 percent of
Reynolds' sales, she said.
   In 1988, Reynolds reported a record net income of $482 million,
or $8.35 per share, on revenues of $5.6 billion.

<TEXT>
   Share prices rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
on Tuesday, and the dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 9.63-point
loser Monday, rose 61.08 points, or 0.19 percent, and closed at
31,937.94. The index plunged in early trading but turned around by
midmorning.
   The dollar closed at 129.03 yen, up 1.40 yen from Monday's
127.63-yen finish. It opened at 129.25 yen and ranged between 128.87
yen and 129.28 yen.
   ``The arrest of (Hisashi) Shinto certainly caused the early
morning decline in the index, but a majority of investors seemed to
have recovered from their (initial) discouragement,'' said an
analyst with Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
   Prosecutors on Monday arrested Shinto, former chairman of the
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan's largest company, on
charges of bribery in connection with a major stock scandal
involving top politicians. His arrest was expected to spark concern
over the fate of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's administration.
   Another factor affecting the Nikkei index, a key barometer for
the market, was Tuesday's account settlement in the futures market,
the analyst said. Participants were inclined to sell off issues and
buy cheaper future issues, he said, speaking anonymously.
   In currency dealings, trading was described as light as market
players stepped to the sidelines following news of the arrests of
Shinto and his former secretary, said a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Because the dollar had risen quite high against the yen already,
participants were reluctant to continue their dollar buying, but
``there are no incentives not to buy the dollar either,'' the dealer
said.
   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told reporters
Tuesday that the yen's decline ``did not have anything to do (with
Shinto's arrest). It's a market, afterall, and who knows why it
moves.''

<TEXT>
   Increases in housing prices and mortgage
interest rates caused a January drop in an index measuring the
ability of a typical American family to buy a home, a real estate
trade group says.
   The National Association of Realtors says its affordability index
was at 108 in January, down from 111.2 in December. It was the
largest month-to-month drop since a similar decline in January 1988.
   The new January number means that a family earning the median
income of $32,207 annually had 8 percent more income than needed to
qualify for a mortgage covering 80 percent of the purchase price of
a median-priced home.
   The median price for an existing home in January was $91,500,
meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. January's
median was up $2,800 from the previous month.
   The mortgage rate used to calculate the index rose to 9.61
percent in January from 9.59 percent, representing a composite of
fixed and adjustable rates.

<NOTE>FDA Warns About Garlic Mix</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some commercial and homemade chopped garlic and
oil mixes can cause potentially fatal botulism if left at room
temperature, the federal government warns.
   The Food and Drug Administration also asked producers of the
commercial products to review their labeling to assure that the need
for refrigeration is clearly marked on shipping cartons and the
product containers.
   The warnings follow an investigation in Kingston, N.Y., last
month in which two men and a woman were hospitalized with botulism
after a dinner at the home of one of the victims. The three had
eaten a chopped garlic and oil mix that had been used in a spread
for garlic bread, the FDA said.
   The agency said garlic and oil mixes containing little or no
acidifying agent such as phosphoric or citric acid should be kept
refrigerated at all times _ from manufacture to consumption.
   FDA studies have shown that garlic in an oil mixture can support
growth of clostridium botulinum bacteria, whose spores produce a
deadly toxin under certain conditions.
   Botulism is characterized by blurred or double vision, speech and
breathing difficulty and progressive paralysis. Without prompt and
correct treatment, a third of those diagnosed with it may die, the
FDA said.
   Preliminary findings in the Kingston incident being investigated
by the New York Department of Health implicated a commercially
prepared mix called Colavita Chopped Garlic in Extra Virgin Olive
Oil, distributed by Colavita Pasta and Oil Co., Newark, N.J. The
firm is recalling the product and told New York officials that
distribution was discontinued more than a year ago, the FDA said.

   A member of the Federal Communications
Commission is castigating ``exorbitantly paid'' television
journalists and entertainers who he said carried out an
unconscionable campaign against the recent attempt in Congress to
raise the pay of high-level federal officials by 51 percent.
   Commissioner James H. Quello, who would have gotten the pay hike
had it cleared Congress, said it was ``the ultimate in
unconscionable self-appreciation for TV and cable personalities ...
many of whom make 10 to 25 times more than a senator or congressman,
to indulge in a Messianic binge against a salary adjustment to keep
pace with inflation for congressmen, key government officials and
judges.''
   ``Are exorbitantly paid personalities and anchors who utilize
government licensed airwaves to accommodate their perpetual quest
for ratings, money and power really performing more valuable service
than those that grant and manage communications licenses, pass laws
and govern the nation? I think not,'' Quello said in a speech for
the New York chapter of the Federal Communications Bar Association.
   The pay plan would have raised congressional salaries from
$89,500 to $135,000. Quello said Congress and the news media
``failed to emphasize enough that this was a catch-up increment''
recommended by the panel ``to keep government pay abreast of
inflation.''

<HEAD>Muscovites Flock to Record Stores for Western Rock Album</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Soviet rock music fans thronged record
stores in a snowstorm to buy a new album by some of the West's
biggest stars and carry home autographs of the likes of British
rocker Peter Gabriel.
   The album, with music by two dozen Western musicians, was
produced by Greenpeace, the international environmental group.
Millions of dollars from its sales will go toward fighting
environmental problems in the Soviet Union.
   The hoopla was especially great Monday on Moscow's Kalinin
Prospekt outside the Melodiya store, where Gabriel and Annie Lennox
of the Eurythmics autographed copies of ``Breakthrough.''
   The album also contains music by artists including U2, Sting, the
Grateful Dead, Talking Heads, Huey Lewis and the News, Bruce Hornsby
and the Range, Sade, John Cougar Mellencamp and Dire Straits.
   At the Kalinin store, a police guard was posted at the door, and
a steel barricade was set up on the sidewalk as young Soviets
wearing traditional Russian fur hats and Western-style ski caps
massed.
   Melodiya, the name of the state's record company as well as
record stores, is known for small pressings of popular albums,
especially rock, and the initial pressing of 500,000 copies of
``Breakthrough'' was likely to last just a couple of days _ if not
hours. Melodiya plans to release 3 million copies, as well as
500,000 cassettes, in this country of 285 million people.
   A black market for Western rock recordings thrives in the Soviet
Union, and even Melodiya Director Valery Sukharado admitted to
reporters, ``I don't know how many (copies) will be released on the
black market.''
   The two-record album carries a compilation of songs previously
issued in the West by the individuals and groups. International
release is scheduled for April 25.
   Sukharado said Melodiya will donate about $16 million from record
sales to a Moscow-based charity that is working with Greenpeace on
environmental problems in the Soviet Union.
   Peter Bahouth, the executive director of the Greenpeace branch in
the United States, said his organization plans to open an office in
Moscow.
   Some of the rock stars told a news conference here that they were
surprised at how well rock is known in the Soviet Union, where the
music was once condemned as ``decadent'' and kept underground.
   Now, the sounds of Dire Straits or Soviet pop stars like Black
Coffee are heard on once-staid official Radio Moscow.
   Jerry Harrison, keyboard player for the Talking Heads, said he
and several other Western musicians visited a rock music center
Sunday night in Gorky Park and saw Soviet musicians who had made
their own instruments.
   ``That shows how much the kids in the Soviet Union want to play
rock music and are interested in it,'' Harrison said.
   Gabriel said he liked several Soviet rock groups and quipped,
``This is the best way to conquer the West.''
   He said he learned during his visit that one of his albums had
been released in the Soviet Union and ``found the fans here very
warm, friendly and generous.'' Gabriel said he would like to perform
in the Soviet Union next year if his band is ready.

   A woman at odds with her husband over who
should have control of their frozen embryos says the eggs represent
life and the case should be looked at as a custody battle.
   Her husband says the eggs represent his future and that he should
be allowed to determine if he becomes a father or not.
   The courts don't know what to say as there isn't much precedent
concerning in-vitro fertilization and divorce.
   ``I consider them life,'' Mary Sue Davis, 28, said of the eggs
that she and Junior Lewis Davis placed in frozen storage a few years
ago as part of the in-vitro fertilization program at Fort Sanders
Regional Medical Center in Knoxville.
   ``If I cannot have them, then I'd like to donate them to another
person,'' she said in an interview Saturday at the couple's log home
in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains.
   Davis, 30, filed a divorce petition last month that also asked
for a temporary restraining order preventing his wife from having
any of the seven eggs implanted. The document called them joint
property.
   Blount County Circuit Judge W. Dale Young quickly granted the
order as attorneys searched for any court rulings that could guide
them. No further court dates have been set.
   Davis said his wife's ability to have the embryos implanted after
the divorce violates his right to control his own future.
   He did not ask that the embryos be destroyed.
   It's unsettling ``to know that ... 10 years from now I could be
walking down the street and bump into my child and not know it,'' he
said.
   He also objects to Mrs. Davis donating the embryos to another
woman.
   ``I would not let her donate,'' he said. ``If I would not let her
have them, why would I give them to a complete stranger?''
   The Davises met while both were in the Army and stationed in West
Germany, he as a serviceman and she as a secretary.
   After they were married in 1979, they moved to Tennessee where
she works as a service representative at a boat company in nearby
Knoxville and he is an electrical technician for the Maryville
Housing Authority.
   The Davises were unable to conceive a child and gave up on
adoption when they learned their only chances were for foster
children, who later could be taken away.
   They opted for in-vitro fertilization, which involves surgically
removing a woman's eggs from her ovaries and fertilizing them with a
man's sperm in a laboratory dish.
   The embryos are then either implanted or frozen for future
implantation.
   Frozen embryos are viable for several years, the divorce petition
said.
   The chances of a pregnancy are about 15 percent with each egg
that is implanted, in-vitro fertilization specialists say. Each
implant costs between $4,000 and $10,000.
   The couple said they never signed a contract before entering the
program and never discussed what would happen to the eggs should
something happen to either of them. Such contracts are fairly common
in ``test tube baby'' cases.
   Mrs. Davis said the eggs are the result of years of surgery,
tests and self-administered injections and are her best shot at
becoming a mother.
   ``I would love to be a mother,'' she said. ``I'm not even sure I
can go through the program again. It's a very hard process, mentally
and physically.''
   She also said that if she became pregnant with any of the embryos
she would consider raising the child by herself and not seek child
support.
   ``I respect her (view),'' Davis said. ``But the fact remains that
she can still have a baby through another donor.''
   The only case resembling the Davises' seems to be that of a Los
Angeles couple killed in a 1983 airplane crash.
   The couple, Mario and Elsa Rios, did not leave instructions on
what to do with the embryos they had in frozen storage. Debate
followed as to whether the fertilized eggs should be destroyed,
implanted inside another woman or left frozen.
   The embryos remain frozen and are stored at the Monash
University-Queen Victoria Medical Centre in Melbourne, Australia,
where the Rios' had participated in an in-vitro fertilization
program, a hospital spokeswoman said last week.

   Levity has returned to the police barracks
in this ailing steel mill town now that residents have raised
$110,000 to enable nearly half the force to return to work following
a week's layoff.
   ``It's the greatest feeling in the world,'' said Alfred Tedesco,
one of 21 officers who returned to work Sunday following a week-long
furlough.
   ``We're used to being on the other side of the fence. And to see
something like this touches a part of your heart.''
   The layoffs, ordered by Mayor Louis Washowich to save $90,000,
were to last three months. But the fund-raising campaign led by the
voluntary ambulance crew in this town 15 miles south of Pittsburgh
netted more than enough money to bring all the officers back
immediately.
   ``As a police officer, you tend to become hardened to life. You
deal with the criminal element for so long that you tend to believe
there are only two types of people in this world, cops and bad
guys,'' said Inspector Daniel Kochman, who was laid off after more
than nine years on the force. ``To see something like this opens
your eyes again.''
   The McKeesport Emergency Medical Services started the campaign
with a $15,000 donation from its own building fund.
   Throughout last week, some of the 38,000 residents dropped
thousands of dollars into cans at churches, clubs, restaurants and
businesses, and people from as far away as Nevada sent checks and
good wishes.
   By Friday, the campaign netted more than $54,000, which
Pittsburgh-based Equibank promised to match.
   ``I would have bet my whole year's pay that they wouldn't have
made it,'' said Judy McLaren, a clerk on the 50-member police force.
   Others weren't so skeptical, though.
   ``People here have seen hard times. They know what it's like to
be down,'' said Connie Derrick, who manages a discount store. ``For
a town that depressed to get that much money together says a lot.''
   Donations have continued to pour in, said Betty Patterson,
president of the ambulance service. Fund-raisers from disco dances
to polka parties are planned every weekend for the next month.
   Any surplus money will be saved for next year, she said, so the
police department can use it in case of a similar financial crunch.
   Washowich ordered the layoffs after state arbitrators awarded the
police 4 to 4{ percent wage hikes.
   The mayor had asked all city employees to accept wage freezes
after the city found itself $1.3 million in debt at the end of last
year, but the police refused and the issue went to arbitration.
   New officers on the force make $14,000 to $14,500 a year, or
about $6.97 an hour.
   Although heartened by the campaign, the mayor said the city still
must deal with the $225,000 cost of the increase in police salaries
in 1990.

<HEAD>Rebels Plan Offensive; Legislator Rejects Election Delay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LAS VUELTAS, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the country's
rightist-controlled legislature has rejected postponement of this
month's presidential elections _ leftist rebels' main condition for
participation.
   Ricardo Alvarenga made the statement Monday, a day after a rebel
commander interviewed in this town said the guerrillas are on the
verge of a new offensive in the country's nine-year civil war.
   Prospects for peace had dramatically brightened then dimmed after
Jan. 24, when the guerrillas offered to participate in the
presidential vote and respect its outcome if given six extra months
to prepare and guaranteed security. The rebels boycotted all five
previous national elections this decade as shams.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte has proposed a six-week delay of
the vote, but rebels dismissed it as inadequate.
   The military called a three-month unilateral cease-fire last week
and urged the rebels to do the same.
   But Diego, a top officer of the rebels' Popular Liberation
Forces, said Sunday that, ``We are ready to escalate the war.'' His
force is one of five guerrilla factions united in the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front.
   ``To say we will (escalate the war), then not do it, would be
stupid both militarily and politically. So you can be sure we'll do
it,'' he said, sitting on a bench in a classroom off the main square
of Las Vueltas, a rebel-dominated town in the northern province of
Chalatenango. Diego is a nom de guerre.
   Over his shoulder was slung a Soviet-designed AK-47 assault
rifle, one of several hundred Diego said his group bought indirectly
this year from U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels based in Honduras.
   ``The AKs are part of the military leap we're preparing,'' Diego
said. ``It is more potent in terms of firepower. It makes its user
feel more powerful, while contributing to the demoralization of the
enemy.''
   Salvadoran rebel chiefs said last year they were acquiring arms
indirectly from the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. But AK-47s, the
standard Contra weapon, have never been so evident among Salvadoran
guerrillas as during the past few weeks.
   Contra leaders deny their forces, which have been mostly idle
since Washington cut off military aid 13 months ago, are selling
weapons. El Salvador's military high command contends Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government is giving AK-47s to the rebels.
   Several reports say the weapon may already be in the hands of up
to 10 percent of the estimated 7,000 rebel fighters.
   Diego did not say when the offensive might begin.
   On Monday, Alvarenga said the constitution blocks any change in
the date of elections.
   ``Just like they (the guerrillas) do not accept the March 19 date
for whatever reasons, we do not accept any change in the date,
because constitutionally the date cannot be changed,'' he told
reporters at the National Assembly.
   On Saturday, the rebels repeated their charge that the
U.S.-backed government was procrastinating and proposed direct talks
this week in San Salvador, the capital.
   The single-chamber legislature, controlled by the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance, or ARENA, has virtual veto power
over any postponement.
   ARENA, of which Alvarenga is a leader, is favored to win the
presidency in next week's election.
   The constitution says the election must be held at least two
months before a new government takes office. Duarte's term ends on
June 1.
   Leaders of Duarte's Christian Democratic Party have said
elections could be legally postponed and an interim president named
by the legislature if a political consensus existed to do so.
   The civil war has claimed the lives of about 70,000 people, most
of them civilians.

   The death threat from Iran's fundamentalist patriarch prompted
the 12 European Economic Community nations and several other
countries to withdraw their ambassadors from Iran.
   In a conciliatory move, Britain's Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe said after the Iran parliament vote last week that ``The
Satanic Verses'' has offended some Britons as well as Moslems.
   Tehran Radio welcome the statement, but demanded that Britain
take ``concrete action.''
   Iran suggested London could defuse the crisis by banning the
novel and prosecuting Rushdie. Britain has steadfastly refused to do
either.
   Nineteen people have died in Pakistan and India in violence
related to the book, which has been banned in countries including
Pakistan, India, Kenya and Egypt.

   IRNA said the Foreign Ministry decision to sever ties was
announced at 11.30 a.m., ``exactly the same time the Majlis
(parliament) last Tuesday decided to give Britain seven days to
decide over the matter.''
   The agency, quoted a Foreign Ministry statement as saying: ``The
world oppressors and the West which find genuine Islam against their
objectives and plots, have risen against Islam and in this
anti-Islamic campaign the role of the British government is salient.
   ``In the past two centuries, Britain has been in the frontline of
plots and treachery against Islam and Moslems,'' said the statement,
according to IRNA, which was monitored in Nicosia.
   ``The Moslem nations will not forget the British plots, including
creation of the Zionist regime, the all-out support for it, sowing
of discord among Moslems and working against Islamic movements in
Iraq, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan and other Islamic countries,'' it added.
   ``Over the years, colonial Britain which has received severe
blows from the creation of the Islamic movements, has changed its
tactics and ways of opposing Islam.
   ``To this end it has adopted more sophisticated cultural and
political methods, rather than the previous military and direct
intervention,'' IRNA quoted the statement as saying.

<HEAD>Conservative GOP Senator Won't Seek Third Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE RECHT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Gordon Humphrey says a man can
take only so much of ``meeting presidents and meeting prime
ministers and spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year,'' and
is calling it quits after this term.
   ``You only get one life, and I didn't want to spend the rest of
my productive years in Congress,'' said the 48-year-old Republican,
who describes himself as the most conservative voice in the Senate.
   He said he would return to private life, although he did not rule
out a future run for office.
   Humphrey, with two years left on his six-year term, said he was
making his decision public now to give potential Republican
candidates a chance to raise money needed for the race.
   ``I have to admit I was very tempted to run again, not
withstanding my pledge of old to limit myself to two terms,''
Humphrey said. ``Power, after all, is not only corrupting ... but
it's addictive. It's fun exercising power; politics is fun.''
   The problem, he said, is ``you get caught up with it, meeting
presidents and meeting prime ministers and spending hundreds of
billions of dollars a year. ...
   ``You lose touch with the real world,'' he said. ``I don't think
I've reached that part yet, but I think it could happen in a third
term.''
   A former airline pilot who never considered himself a politician,
Humphrey had never held office before he ran for the Senate in 1978
and pulled a stunning upset over Democratic incumbent Thomas
McIntyre.
   He easily won re-election in 1984, and would have been considered
the favorite to win again in 1990 in a heavily Republican state.
   Humphrey occasionally criticized the Reagan administration for
softening its stance against communism and supporting a
congressional pay raise.
   But his voice has been heard the loudest as an opponent of
abortion and the pay raises and as a supporter for the Afghanistan
rebels.
   Humphrey has consistently been given 100 ratings by conservative
groups that monitor Senate votes and zero ratings by liberal groups.
   Humphrey called Congress a ``wonderful institution, but human
nature mucks it up an awful lot.'' He complained that Congress is
deteriorating because it is ``becoming more and more powerful at the
expense of the presidency.''
   ``We used to hear about the imperial presidency,'' he said.
``Nowadays, we're hearing about the imperial Congress.''

<HEAD>Mikhail Baryshnikov Stars in `Metamorphosis' on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS three grafs with other New York reviews; No PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Misha talks! Yes, Mikhail Baryshnikov has as much
stage presence as a theater actor as he does as a dance superstar.
   He proves it in ``Metamorphosis,'' a riveting adaptation of Franz
Kafka's short novel that arrived Monday night at Broadway's Ethel
Barrymore Theater.
   Baryshnikov is fine. But the real star of the evening is director
and adaptor Steven Berkoff, who imposes a theatrical unity on the
play that is astonishing.
   Every component of this stylized production serves the script
brilliantly _ from setting to costumes to lighting to music to
movement to acting. There is a seamlessness to this production, a
quality that also enhanced Berkoff's provocative staging of
``Coriolanus,'' which played recently at the New York Shakespeare
Festival.
   Still, most theatergoers will focus their attention on
Baryshnikov. In his first dramatic stage role, he portrays Gregor
Samsa, a hard-working traveling salesman who wakes up one morning
and finds he is turning into an insect, a dung beetle to be specific.
   You'd expect his physical movements to be superb, and they are.
Dressed in a striped waistcoat and knickers and wearing wire-rimmed
spectacles, Baryshnikov epitomizes Kafka's beleaguered little man,
while at the same time suggesting the insect. He uses his feet,
hands, arms and legs to mime his gradual change into the bug. It's a
startling transformation, powerful, unnerving, yet touched with pity.
   But Baryshnikov also is in command of his voice, using it to
great effect in sorrow _ listen to him call out for his mother _ and
in humor, particularly when he munches the food thrown to him by his
horrified family.
   The action, lasting some 95 minutes without intermission, unfolds
on a raked stage with black lines radiating across a gray floor. The
scenic supervisor is Duke Durfee. A large skeleton of black metal
bars shaped like a spider fans out across the playing area. Three
spider-like stools are strewn across the footlights. Upstage, above
a small ramp, is a cage where Gregor spends much of the evening
watching his family. There are no props. Everything is suggested
rather than played realistically.
   Three other actors, portraying Gregor's family, share the stage
with Baryshnikov for the entire play. Each is a distinctive,
memorable character. Rene Auberjonois plays the father, a gruff
bully fearful of losing his son's meal ticket, while Laura Esterman
is right on the edge _ and on target _ as the loving yet fearful
mother. Madeleine Potter exudes a steel reserve as Gregor's faithful
sister.
   Mitch Kreindel and T.J. Meyers offer fine comic cameos as an
outraged chief clerk and a fussy lodger. In a way, they all scurry
like insects in a frenzy over Gregor's hideous transformation.
   Berkoff sees ``Metamorphosis'' as an existential horror story
with no way out for the tormented Gregor or for the other, almost
hysterical characters.
   The director captures that mood of desolation through dramatic
use of lighting, supervised here by Brian Nason. There are several
episodes when giant shadows play across the back wall of the set,
giving the drama a nightmarish quality. Larry Spivack's music
contributes to that tension, building in volume as the family
realizes what has happened to Gregor and what eventually must be
done to get rid of him.
   Berkoff's production ends on a poignant note. The final image _
Baryshnikov curled up in almost a fetal position _ is haunting. But
then the whole show is a series of haunting images, pictures that
reinforce Kafka's striking story of what society does to those who
are more than a little different.
   In other reviews, Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times: ``It's
hard to guess who will suffer most ... devotees of Franz Kafka,
whose story is distorted into Marxist kitsch by this adaptation, or
fans of Mikhail Baryshnikov, whose stage debut as a dramatic actor,
however dignified, amounts to little more than a sideshow to the
loud circus surrounding him.''
   ``Kafka never lets the human dimension disappear, however surreal
the situation,'' Howard Kissel wrote in the Daily News. ``Berkoff,
on the other hand, never lets the human dimension appear at all. ...
As an attempt to convey Kafka's world, Berkoff's adaptation is
tiresome. As a piece of merchandising, though, it's a triumph.''
   ``The Berkoff play itself is an expressionist impression of the
Kafka original _ with little of the finite detail that makes the
Kafka so chilling and moving,'' wrote Clive Barnes in the New York
Post. ``... However, whatever objections one may have to Berkoff as
an adaptor, his work here as director is fascinating and
unquestionably effective.''

   Well gol-l-l-l-y! Not only was Sheriff Andy
Taylor's hometown of Mayberry mythical; the hometown of actor Andy
Griffith, who created the role, hasn't existed for decades.
   Mount Airy has been in a Twilight Zone.
   As a result of a typographical error, the city's charter was
inadvertently repealed by the Legislature on March 29, 1967. That
means that such official acts as tax levies, elections and town
expenditures haven't been valid _ technically _ since then.
   ``Whoops,'' said state Rep. David H. Diamont. ``Legally, the
whole town hasn't existed for 22 years.''
   To patch things up, Diamont has introduced a bill to validate all
acts by the Surry County municipality's town board since the foul-up.
   Legislative officials aren't sure who made the mistake, but
believe it apparently occurred in drafting legislation or in putting
the law on the books.
   Gerry F. Cohen, director of bill drafting for the Legislature,
said staffers recently spotted the error after Mount Airy officials
asked about a law concerning the appointment of the tax collector.
   ``We found the disappearance of Mount Airy while doing
research,'' Cohen said. ``I wouldn't be surprised if there were
other missing cities out there.''

   India will provide economic and
humanitarian aid to the embattled Soviet-backed government of
President Najib in Afghanistan, officials of both countries say.
   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil of Afghanistan declined to give any
details of the assistance, which was announced Monday as he
completed a five-day visit.
   He would not say if it would involve an airlift of food to the
besieged Afghan capital of Kabul. Most of the Afghan countryside is
in guerrilla hands.
   A spokesman for India's Foreign Ministry also said agreement had
been reached but gave no details.
   The Afghan official accused Western nations of thwarting relief
missions. A U.N. airlift of food was halted after one flight last
month when airline crews refused to fly to Kabul, fearing for their
safety.
   The United States, western European nations and their allies
closed their embassies in Kabul in January and February as the
Soviet Union withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan.
   The Western allies said they were worried security would
deteriorate after the Soviet withdrawal was completed on Feb. 15.
   India is the only non-Soviet bloc nation that maintained
relations with Kabul after the Soviet Union intervened in
Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up its client regime.
   Speaking in Dari through an interpreter, Wakil repeated his
government's complaints that the United States and Pakistan were
continuing to support the guerrillas who have been fighting to
unseat his government for a decade.

<TEXT>
   Visionaries in this aging small town
wanted to bring profits to Prophetstown to save it, so they went out
and bought a company.
   ``We figured if we didn't grow, we'd die,'' said Howard ``Bud''
Thompson, 58, a hog hauler and president of Prophetstown
Manufacturing Inc., which brought Clear Creek Furniture Co. to this
community of 2,100.
   ``It's going to take something like this to keep small towns
alive, revived, or whatever you want to call it,'' he said. ``As you
go around Illinois you can smell death.''
   Clear Creek has eight workers who saw, sand and spray finish on
oak furniture patterned after designs of the 18th and 19th century.
The furniture sells in 14 states, especially the Midwest.
   With the federal government's approval, local officials created
PMI, sold $10 shares and made an offer to Darrell Milsap: You need
the capital, we want your furniture.
   Milsap and his wife, Diane, packed up the company and moved 75
miles from Granville in north-central Illinois to the banks of the
Rock River in Whiteside County, where they manage the business now
owned by PMI.
   ``It's very difficult to keep a small town going,'' said Clear
Creek's chief assembler, Wayne Proeger, 34, turning off his electric
saw to talk about the company and the future of his hometown,
population 2,100, about 140 miles west of Chicago.
   ``I like living in small, rural communities. There's more of a
relationship between citizens. In big cities people don't talk to
one another.''
   Thompson, a member of the Illinois State Board of Education,
believes the furniture company has boosted the town's pride. When
PMI was selling stock to make the purchase of Clear Creek possible,
it posted signs that said, ``Buy A Share In Prophetstown's Future.''
   Many did.
   ``The spirit has returned,'' said Thompson, who noted that
residents, many of whom are elderly, recently voted twice over 12
months to raise their taxes.
   ``People keep their lawns mowed and their bushes trimmed. Pride _
it's an ingredient I sure appreciate. I know it sounds a little
hokey, but that's what it's all about.''
   PMI hopes to add a few more small companies to Prophetstown's
economy, moves that would depend on the profits earned at Clear
Creek.
   Last year, Clear Creek had sales of $280,000. Thompson is
projecting sales of $360,000 for 1989, and Milsap hopes to add a
second shift.
   ``Sales haven't been a problem,'' said Thompson.

   Snow and rain was falling along much of the Atlantic seaboard
this morning while rain was falling in northern California and parts
of the Pacific Northwest.
   A storm centered over North Carolina produced snow from the Ohio
Valley to the middle Atlantic states and southern New England. The
heaviest accumulations were in Pennsylvania, where up to 10 inches
blanketed the Laurel Mountains in the western part of the state and
up to 6 inches fell in eastern areas.
   Winter storm warnings were in effect today for northern and
central portions of Maryland and Delaware, northern Virginia and the
eastern part of West Virginia.
   Showers and thunderstorms doused part of the southern Atlantic
Coast region. Fayetteville, N.C., recorded 1.37 inches of rain in
the six hours ending at 1 a.m. EST. Several other areas between
Maryland and South Carolina had over three-quarters of an inch.
   In the West, a cold front carried rain into northern California
and parts of the Pacific Northwest.
   A winter storm watch was posted for late today for the Lake Tahoe
area of Nevada and the northern Sierra Nevada range of California.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation this morning.
   Today's forecast called for snow in the middle Atlantic region,
with some lingering snow likely in the central Appalachians and the
upper Ohio Valley. Rain was expected to be scattered across the
Carolinas and central and southern Florida, and widespread from the
northern and central Pacific Coast to Idaho and Utah.
   Highs were forecast to be in the teens and 20s from the Northeast
to the Great Lakes; the 30s from eastern parts of the northern
Plains through the middle Mississippi Valley, the lower Ohio and
Tennessee valleys into southern Virginia; the 60s and 70s from
central and Southern California through the southern Rockies to the
Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and across much of the Florida
peninsula; and the 80s to near 90 degrees across the desert
Southwest. Highs elsewhere were expected to be in the 40s or 50s.
   Temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 14 degrees below zero at
Houlton, Maine, to 77 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Papers Speak Of Rail Safety Crisis After 42 Die In Three Crashes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition lawmakers charged that Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's government is not spending enough on Britain's
state-run railways after the system's third fatal train crash in
three months.
   Forty-two people have been killed in the three crashes, the
latest of which occurred Monday near Glasgow and claimed the lives
of two passengers. Forty-four people were hurt when the two commuter
trains collided.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon later acknowledged passenger
fears of traveling on the British Rail network.
   ``We have got to allay that concern (among the public about rail
safety) and remove that concern,'' he said in Parliament.
   On Saturday, five people died and 94 were injured when two
passenger trains crashed near Purley station on London's southern
outskirts.
   Thirty-five were killed and more than 100 injured Dec. 12 in a
crash involving three passenger trains at Clapham Junction near
London.
   John Prescott, transport spokesman for the opposition Labor
Party, on Monday called for an inquiry into safety ``to ensure that
standards are not being compromised in order to meet financial
targets that are too tight and demanding.''
   Speaking in the House of Commons, Prescott quoted a former
British Rail safety official, Stanley Hall, as saying safety was
being compromised because Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government was ``tight-fisted.''
   Prescott said the government grant to the rail system had been
cut by 35 percent in five years, a decrease of more than $3.4
billion.
   Channon accused Prescott of trying to score political points. He
said government investment in British Rail was running at
``historically incredibly high levels.'' It stands at $963 million
this year and will rise to an average of $1.29 billion a year over
the next four years, he said.
   Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the National Union of
Railwaymen, the 117,000-member train engineers' union, said
government cuts have impaired safety.
   The liberal London newspaper The Guardian, in an editorial today
on the three crashes, wrote: ``This is becoming an epidemic .... No
one wants money spent foolishly. But if it is a choice between a
safe or a more profitable railway, there is not much doubt which way
the public would vote.''
   The independent Times of London, in a headline, spoke of a
``safety crisis.''
   The Conservative tabloid the Daily Mail spoke of a ``growing
crisis of confidence'' among passengers.

<TEXT>
   Journalists today are generally more
responsible than ever, but some ``trash television'' interview
programs are ``absolutely, totally useless stuff,'' says Walter
Cronkite.
   The former CBS anchorman said programs that depend on the sordid,
lurid and sensational endanger good journalism.
   ``I am concerned about the garbage that is masquerading as
television these days,'' Cronkite said. ``Most of it is real
scandal-tabloid journalism ... absolutely, totally useless stuff.''
   But, Cronkite said, ``We're very lucky. ... We have a more
responsible press today in this country than we've ever had.''
   He said reporters now are much more enterprising and
conscientious than during the mid-1940s and several years after,
when journalists were passive and practiced ``reporting by handout.''
   Cronkite, who lives in New York, made his remarks Monday during a
news conference to pitch a local water pollution documentary he
narrated. He signed off for the last time as anchor of ``The CBS
Evening News'' eight years ago Monday.

<HEAD>Troops Kill One Palestinian, 26 Reported Wounded</HEAD>

   Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian
teen-ager today and blew up the houses of two Arabs suspected of
killing a soldier, the army said. Twenty-six Arabs were reported
wounded by gunfire in protests.
   In the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian doctor said soldiers and border
police barged into a U.N. clinic while chasing demonstrators and
clubbed 25 people, some awaiting treatment for other injuries.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Hakam Baker, 18, was fatally
shot in the neck and back by soldiers.
   An army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
dead man was one of three suspects who fled from an army patrol,
ignoring orders to halt and warning shots fired in the air. He said
the man had a record of anti-Israeli activities and was wanted by
security forces on unspecified charges.
   However, residents told an Arab reporter that Baker was standing
on a rooftop when he was hit and said that soldiers gave no advance
warning before opening fire.
   The shooting occurred as the army conducted a security sweep in
the narrow, winding streets of Nablus' casbah.
   About 90 minutes after the shooting, the army said soldiers
destroyed two houses near the casbah. The houses belonged to two
suspects who allgedly dropped a concrete block on the head of
paratrooper Benny Meisner on Feb. 24. The house from which the block
was thrown was demolished earlier.
   Today's death brought to 391 the number of Palestinians killed
since Palestinians began a revolt against Israel's 21-year
occupation on Dec. 8, 1987. Seventeen Israelis have also died.
   The unrest in Gaza and the West Bank came in protest of the
deaths of three Palestinians on Monday, including the unexplained
death of a Palestinian held in a Shin Bet interrogation center.
   Widespread demonstrations took place in both refugee camps and
towns in the Gaza Strip, where 650,000 Palestinians live. Arab
reports said 22 Palestinians were wounded by gunfire, and there
several reports of soldiers beating Arabs.
   Arab reports said four Palestinians were wounded in the West Bank.
   Claire Grimes, a spokeswoman for the U.N. Relief and Works
Agency, which administers refugee education and relief programs,
said that ``Every area of the Gaza Strip is very active.''
   Youths left school, set up barricades and burned tires in
Jabaliya refugee camp to protest the death Monday of camp resident
Ahmed Ramadan Azami, who was shot in the chest by soldiers during a
demonstration.
   Army spokesmen said a curfew was imposed on Jabaliya but said
they had no details about the violence in the camp or elsewhere in
the Gaza Strip.
   Soldiers chased Palestinians into the U.N. agency's clinic in the
refugee camp and caused some damage to the facility, an Arab doctor
and a U.N. official said.
   A physician at the clinic, who identified himself only as Dr.
Ahmed, told The Associated Press by telephone: ``We treated 45 cases
of beatings, regular bullets, rubber bullets, and there were
hundreds of relatives gathered in front of the clinic.''
   Some of the relatives threw stones at soldiers, who chased
Palestinians into the clinic, the doctor said. There, the soldiers
beat about 25 people with nightsticks and broke windows, a
microscope, the office telephone and some syringes, he said.
   ``They beat some of the injured people we were treating,'' Dr.
Ahmed said, adding three beating victims suffered factured skulls
and were sent to a hospital.
   An U.N. official, who insisted on anonymity, confirmed the
incident in Jabaliya and said damage was still being assessed.

<HEAD>Relatives Fear for Hostages After Iran Breaks Ties With Britain</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Satanic Verses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives and friends of Britons believed held in
Lebanon and Iran said today that Iran's decision to break diplomatic
ties with Britain will make it harder to free the captives.
   ``Hostages' families all around the world will be upset that a
major player in this game is now out of the arena,'' said John
Waite, a cousin of missing Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite. ``We
will have to sit back and wait, rather dismayed.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported today that
Iran decided to sever ties at the end of a one-week deadline that
Iran's parliament had set for Britain to disavow Salman Rushdie's
novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Britain withdrew its diplomats from Iran after Iran's spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called for Rushdie's death on
Feb. 14. The novel has set off worldwide protests by Moslems holding
the book to be blasphemous.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Saturday that Iran must
repudiate the death threat before diplomatic relations can be
normalized.
   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held in
Lebanon by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Waite, journalist
John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dual
British and Irish nationality whose release is also sought by the
Irish government.
   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, a New
York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they
killed him. His body was never found.
   ``Nothing can ever be resolved unless there can be discussions
with the other side _ that was the whole basis of Terry's life,''
said John Waite, whose 49-year-old cousin vanished in Beirut on Jan.
20, 1987, while trying to negotiate the release of two U.S. hostages.
   Waite said many Moslems had been ``deeply insulted'' by Rushdie's
novel. But he added, ``I don't see that the British government could
have acted in any other way'' over Khomeini's death threat.
   The brother of British businessman Roger Cooper, imprisoned in
Tehran for alleged spying, said he expected the diplomatic break to
remain for ``quite some time.''
   ``Iran doesn't like losing face, and they are unlikely to come
forward with a begging bowl,'' said journalist Paul Cooper. ``This
will have a very negative effect on the chances of my brother and
the hostages (in Lebanon) being released. It is a sad day.''
   ``Our government appears to have made the condition that Khomeini
should retract what he said, but he is not the type of person to do
that,'' Cooper told reporters.
   Chris Pearson, a friend of McCarthy, said the hostages' prospects
of being freed ``have evaporated for the time being.''
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in
Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, the chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   China today declared martial law in the Tibetan
capital of Lhasa following three days of anti-Chinese rioting by
pro-independence activists in which at least 12 people were killed.
   The measure marked the first time since the Cultural Revolution
that martial law has been publically announced in China.
   Police slapped a temporary curfew and cleared the streets in the
afternoon, threatening to shoot anyone found in the central square
or in the Tibetan section nearby, an American witness said. They had
fired on protesters earlier today, said foreign travelers.
   The State Council, or cabinet, said martial rule would be imposed
at midnight. The order was signed by Premier Li Peng, the official
Xinhua News Agency said.
   By early this afternoon, groups of 20 to 30 police armed with
automatic weapons, shields and sticks had begun taking positions
throughout the Tibetan part of Lhasa, telling all people to get off
the streets, an American witness said.
   ``All the Tibetans just disappeared, everybody just evaporated,''
said the American who was given shelter in a Tibetan house. ``All
demonstrating stopped.''
n clashes between police and Tibetans
demanding an end to Chinese rule over the mountainous and remote
southern region.
   There were no reports of casualties today.
   Western travelers today quoted Tibetans as saying as many as 75
people died and 300 were wounded. There was no independent
confirmation.
   Martial law was never imposed during previous outbreaks of
pro-independence violence in Lhasa over the past 18 months. Police
armed with tear gas, guns and machine guns had been charged with
subduing the violence.
   It was last publically imposed during the ultra-leftist Cultural
Revolution from 1966-76, when bands of Red Guards fought armed
battles on the streets of dozens of Chinese cities.
   Chinese police today fired on Tibetans for a third day in Lhasa
and pro-independence activists carried Tibet's banned snow lion flag
around the city's center and lit bonfires of Chinese-owned goods,
the tourists said.
   Tibetans stoned Chinese civilians who ventured into the Tibetan
section of town. One American tourist said he saw a Chinese man
running up the city's main street, Beijing Road, bleeding from his
face and neck.
   A Japanese tourist quoted one wounded Tibetan as saying hospitals
were only treating Chinese, leaving injured Tibetans to fend for
themselves.
   American and Japanese tourists said today's protest march began
shortly after noon near the main square.
   About 50 Tibetans, mostly young, began marching from the square
toward Beijing Road with the Tibetan flag. As they marched, they
threw stones.
   The crowd swelled to about 100 as it passed in front of a
centrally-located hotel, frequented by foreigners, said an American
tourist from Galveston, Texas.
   The protest ended when two trucks carrying 60 armed police
dispersed the crowd, Japanese tourists said. The American said he
saw three Chinese policemen with automatic weapons charge the crowd
on foot.
   Most of the tourists, who spoke by telephone, did so on condition
of anonymity for fear of police reprisals.
   The protests began Sunday when 13 Buddhist monks and nuns started
marching near the Jokhang Temple, a center of Tibetan Buddhism. They
shouted: ``Independence for Tibet!'' Police opened fire, and a crowd
of Tibetans began ransacking Chinese buildings.
   On Monday, thousands of Tibetans flooded the old city. They broke
into small Chinese- and Moslem-run stores, hauled out their goods,
and burned them in bonfires.
   The violence broke out just days before Friday's 30th anniversary
of a failed Tibetan uprising against the Chinese.
   China claims Tibet has been part of China since the 13th century.
Many Tibetans say Tibet should be independent and led by the Dalai
Lama, their spiritual leader who fled to exile during an aborted
uprising in 1959.
   On Monday, the Dalai Lama appealed to world leaders to persuade
the Chinese to find a peaceful solution to the unrest.
   China and the Dalai Lama have agreed to discuss the Tibetan
situation but have yet to agree on a site for the negotiations.
   China has said it will not discuss Tibetan autonomy, which the
Dalai Lama has proposed Tibet be granted in its internal affairs.

<HEAD>Legislator Sees New York Restoring Death Penalty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York will have a new death penalty law by
Nov. 1, predicts the chief Assembly sponsor of legislation to put
the state's electric chair back into use after a 26-year hiatus.
   The Democrat-controlled Assembly approved a bill to restore
capital punishment, following an emotional debate that lasted more
than five hours Monday night.
   On the strength of the 97-48 vote, sponsor Vincent Graber, a
Buffalo-area Democrat, predicted his chamber would override a
promised veto by Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The Republican-controlled state Senate is certain to do likewise,
having approved the death-penalty bill each year for 12 years, most
recently last month. The Senate has voted to override Cuomo's
vetoes, but the Assembly hasn't.
   Monday's 97 death penalty supporters plus two who were absent add
up to 99 ``yes'' votes in the 150-member Assembly. Graber predicted
he would have the 100 votes needed for a veto override by the time
the attempt comes, probably in May.
   ``Certainly it's a whole new ballgame,'' said Graber of the
political pressure that will face death penalty opponents. ``I think
one of them will blink.''
   New York is one of only 13 states without a death penalty law,
and the only one among the nation's seven largest states. New York's
old death penalty statute was gradually eliminated by a series of
court rulings, and the electric chair was last used in 1963.
   Cuomo favors a life-without-parole sentence for murderers.
   During the debate, Graber noted that the number of murders in New
York state last year rose to 2,225, an increase of 213 murders from
1987. And pointing out that most of those murders occurred in New
York City, Graber read off a list of what he said were the 20 most
dangerous Assembly districts in the state. All were in New York City
and all but one were represented by legislators who had voted
against the death penalty bill in the past.
   ``I wouldn't want to reside in one of these Assembly districts,''
Graber said. ``Not having a death penalty in this state isn't
working.''

<HEAD>Book Traces Mayor's Conservative Shift, Recounts Mother's Abortions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, debating social issues in a
new book co-written with Cardinal John O'Connor, says when he was a
child his mother resorted to illegal abortions because of
Depression-era poverty.
   Throughout ``His Eminence and Hizzoner,'' which goes on sale next
week, Koch describes his transformation from a Greenwich Village
liberal to a man who shares views with many conservatives.
   Koch says that a few years before his mother, Joyce Koch, died in
1961, ``she told me that during her lifetime she'd had a number of
abortions. ... Her reasons were economic.''
   When she was pregnant with Koch's younger sister, Pat, his mother
``told me that she tried to induce a miscarriage by jumping off
chairs and trunks. It didn't work. When she finally accepted that
the child was going to be born, she worried that she might have
injured the fetus.
   ``Personally, I don't think abortion on demand is a good idea,''
Koch wrote. Nevertheless, Koch has consistently opposed outlawing
abortion.
   When asked Monday by the New York Post about his position, Koch
said, ``Women will get abortions no matter what the law is for a
whole host of reasons, and I would not want us to go back to the
coat hanger, or other home remedies or quack doctors.''
   The Post and other news organizations, including The New York
Times and New York Newsday, obtained the book Monday.
   In an interview with the Times, Koch said none of the views he
expresses in the book are new.
   Koch, who plans to seek a fourth term as mayor this year, denied
that the book's publication is meant to shore up his support among
Roman Catholic voters. But when asked what impact the book could
have on his political career, the mayor said, ``I hope it helps.''
   For his part, O'Connor restates his opposition to New York City's
gay rights bill, abortion and giving out condoms and hypodermic
needles to stem the spread of AIDS.
   The book, published by William Morrow &amp; Company, costs $18.95.
Both men have said they would donate their earnings to charities.
Koch said the book was O'Connor's idea.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western diplomats said today they
expect Moslem guerrillas soon will launch a long-awaited offensive
against communist forces who still hold Afghanistan's key cities
following the Soviet pullout.
   Insurgents fighting to establish an Islamic republic hint they
are preparing a decisive battle to bring down the Marxist Kabul
government once spring melts snowbound mountain passes, the
diplomats said.
   ``The battle plans appear likely to be executed roughly
simultaneously, with serious fighting expected in most areas during
the month,'' one Western source said on condition of anonymity.
   Guerrilla spokesmen in neighboring Pakistan said an interim
government announced Feb. 24 by the fighters may hold its first
meeting inside Afghanistan on Thursday.
   Washington and Islamabad, the guerrillas' main backers, have
withheld formal recognition of the rival government until it
establishes a capital and begins a functional administration.
   ``Regime forces are extremely worried about the imminent massive
assault by the Afghan (guerrillas) in many areas,'' the Afghan News
Agency of guerrilla leader Gulbaddin Hekmatyar claimed Monday.
   It said the insurgents have sent clandestine messages to
civilians to flee eastern Jalalabad city and the southeastern city
of Kandahar. Diplomats earlier reported similar notices in the
capital.
   Combined assaults on the key cities of Kabul, Jalalabad, Kandahar
and Herat in the west will be tricky.
   Guerrilla field commanders have disagreed over timing and tactics
for fear of causing unnecessary civilian casualties. Many have
argued for an extended siege to encourage defections in hopes the
communists will collapse from poor morale.
   Nearly 1.5 million Afghans, or 10 percent of the population, have
died in the civil war since the ruling People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan seized power in a 1978 coup.
   Soviet forces intervened in December 1979. They withdrew last
month after losing 13,000 men.
   Western diplomats in Pakistan said commanders based near
Jalalabad also are concerned about their ability to control outsize
guerrilla groups that have converged there.
   ``(It) could become a problem, entailing unnecessary killing and
destruction,'' said one source.
   Combined reports indicate fighting around Afghanistan is on the
rise after a winter lull.
   The guerrillas claim thousands of government troops have
surrendered or been captured since the last Red Army soldiers went
home on Feb. 15.

<TEXT>
   California sea lions with a taste for trout are
frustrating wildlife officials by swimming nearly 300 miles back to
Seattle's ship canal within days after they are trucked off to the
ocean.
   Agents trying to protect a wild fish run caught three more sea
lions on Monday, said Susan Ewing of the Washington Department of
Wildlife.
   But a third sea lion that was trapped and shipped to the Pacific
Ocean has returned to the Ballard ship locks, a favorite fishing
ground for the sea lions, said Hal Alabaster, spokesman for the
National Marine Fisheries service.
   The latest returnee was discovered in the floating capture cage
being used to trap the sea lions in an effort to protect steelhead
trout migrating from Puget Sound to Lake Washington through a ship
canal, Alabaster said.
   The three sea lions that have returned have made the 280-mile
trip in four days.
   ``I think we're kind of taking it in stride,'' Ms. Ewing said.
``At least we're giving the fish some relief.''
   Wildlife agents plan to ship all the captured sea lions to
Klipsan Beach on the southwestern Washington coast.
   Eleven sea lions have been transported to the beach. Two others
that were trapped died after they were sedated for tagging, and five
more were let go because cold weather made it risky to drive them to
the coast.

   Fawaz Younis says he commandeered an airliner
in 1985 on command from his Amal militia superiors in the belief
that the act might stop the factional bloodshed in Lebanon.
   Younis also testified Monday that he had given a detailed
confession to FBI agents who arrested him in 1987 because he was
seasick, in shock and ``wanted to do anything so that they would
just leave me alone.''
   An appeals court has already ruled that the confession was valid,
although defense attorney Francis D. Carter has sought to convince
the jury that it was improperly obtained because Younis was ill and
without an attorney at the time.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. has not yet ruled
whether he will instruct the jury to heed the defense argument that
Younis was innocent because he was just following orders.
   Today's scheduled trial session was canceled because of hazardous
conditions caused by snow and freezing rain.
   Younis, 30, has pleaded innocent to a six-count indictment
stemming from the hijacking of a Royal Jordanian Airlines plane in
Beirut, Lebanon, on June 11, 1985. No one was killed in the incident.
   The case is a test of a 1984 statute under which the United
States asserts ``long-arm'' jurisdiction over the taking of American
hostages abroad.
   Younis said Monday that on June 10, 1985, the day before the
hijacking, he was summoned to the office of Aqil Hamiyya, the
military commander of Lebanon's Amal militia. Younis said he was
introduced to four other men and ordered to lead them in the
hijacking.
   Younis, speaking through an Arabic interpreter, testified that he
received more detailed orders from another Amal commander named Ali
Hassan. The Amal militia is the military arm of a Shiite Moslem sect
headed by Nabih Berri, Lebanon's minister of justice.
   ``We were in a state of war,'' Younis said, describing the armed
struggle that has engulfed Lebanon since 1975.
   ``I was following military orders,'' he said he told FBI agents
who arrested him more than two years later. ``It served the
interests of my people and my country.''
   Younis, taking the stand on the sixth full day of the trial, told
the jury he had served in the Amal militia for six years before the
hijacking, and that he carried out the orders in the belief that
``perhaps my action would stop the war and stop the bloodshed of the
youth of Amal.''
   In 1985, Younis said, parts of Lebanon were occupied by three
foreign armies: the Syrians, the Israelis and Palestinian resistance
fighters who had been forced into camps in predominately Moslem West
Beirut.
   The Lebanese Army had split, with a substantial number of
soldiers fighting alongside Amal. In the weeks before the hijacking,
some Palestinian fighters in West Beirut took civilians and Amal
militiamen hostage, he said.
   The hijackers read a statement during a stop in Tunis demanding
that the Palestinians be removed from Lebanon.

<TEXT>
   Government tax agents today raided the
offices of the Indian Express, a national newspaper that has been
highly critical of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   About 30 agents from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence
searched the newspaper's office in Bombay, according to S.C. Parija,
the agency's director. He said agents were searching for evidence of
tax violations by the paper.
   Parija called it ``a small action to investigate specific
points.''
   The Express, India's largest English-language daily with a
circulation of 1.1 million, frequently carries articles, editorials
and cartoons critical of Gandhi and the governing Congress Party.
   Hari Jaisingh, editor of the Bombay edition, said the raid
appeared to be related to business.
   ``Editorial work has not been affected, mercifully,'' he said.
   Senior newspaper executives, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said accountants and other business managers were interrogated by
tax agents.
   One official said the raid may have been prompted by information
provided by a disgruntled manager who was dismissed.
   Today's raids were not the first against the newspaper.
   Agents raided the newspaper offices in January 1987, shortly
after publication of a series of articles alleging a link between
the prime minister and a kickback scandal involving arms contracts
with foreign companies.
   Express editors charged the 1987 raid was politically motivated
and could not have been carried out without Gandhi's permission.
   In March 1986, a house in New Delhi used by the newspaper's
chairman was raided after the newspaper published a leaked copy of a
letter from then-President Zail Singh that was critical of Gandhi.

<HEAD>Activists Slam Government On 1,000th Day Of Emergency</HEAD>

   Anti-apartheid activists today
accused the government of reneging on a promise to release a
substantial number of detainees as South Africa marked its 1,000th
day under a state of emergency.
   ``We challenge the government to lift the state of emergency,
because even that has failed to break the resistance of the
people,'' said Mohammed Valli, a former detainee and a spokesman for
the banned United Democratic Front, the country's largest
anti-apartheid coalition.
   Valli and other speakers at a Johannesburg news conference
reiterated a call for the government to free all being held without
charge. Some have been in custody the entire 1,000 days under
emergency regulations.
   A group of detainees began a hunger strike Jan. 23, demanding to
be released or put on trial. Hundreds in custody joined the strike,
and Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok said Feb. 16 he would
release a ``substantial number'' of detainees within two weeks.
   The government says it has freed 279 people held in South African
prisons since then, and more than 500 people remain in detention.
   The Hunger Strike Support Committee said 202 detainees have been
released and about 700 remain in prison. Many of those released have
been placed under tight restrictions that limit their movements and
prohibit them from participating in anti-government groups.
   ``Anger is growing among detainees, their parents, mass-based
organizations and the community as a whole at Vlok's failure to
honor his agreement,'' the Support Committee said in a statement.
   ``The general impression created as a result of his talks with
lawyers, church leaders and detainees' parents was that well over
half of the detainee population would be released,'' the statement
added.
   More than 500 activists in detention have participated in the
hunger strike, but most resumed eating when Vlok promised the large
scale releases. However, detainees in Natal Province have continued
their fast and about 50 remain hospitalized nationwide, the Support
Committee said.
   The committee said detainees were considering rejoining the
hunger strike and that sympathy fasts were being planned around the
country.
   A spokesman for Vlok, Leon Mellet, said the law and order
minister was ``looking at each detainee's case individually.''
   An estimated 30,000 people, almost all black, have been detained
for varying lengths of time under the state of emergency declared by
President P.W. Botha on June 12, 1986.
   The government has banned most black-led anti-apartheid groups
since the emergency went into effect.
   Some 4,000 people have died since widespread unrest erupted in
September 1984. Most deaths occurred before the nationwide state of
emergency was declared, although there has been ongoing
black-on-black faction fighting in Natal Province.
   Police said today five blacks were killed overnight in unrest
around the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg, where most of the
fighting has occurred.
   The state of emergency gives security forces widespread powers
and prohibits most forms of peaceful protest. Censorship rules
imposed under the emergency restrict reporting about unrest and
actions by security forces, but the measures have not been
comprehensively enforced.

<HEAD>Long-Dead Baby May Have Lived About A Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELKRIDGE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The skeleton of an infant found in a trunk
appears to have been a girl who lived about a month before dying of
an unknown cause 50 years ago, according to a Smithsonian
Institution anthropologist.
   Douglas H. Ubelaker, curator of anthropology at the Smithsonian,
said Monday the age of the baby's remains ``were compatible'' with a
T-shirt the infant was wearing that bore the logo ``World's Fair
1939.''
   He and the state medical examiner, Dr. John E. Smialek, said the
infant appeared to have been alive for as long as a month before it
died and there was no evidence of any fatal injury or disease that
might have caused the death.
   Smialek said his office is ``listing the cause of death as
undetermined.''
   The remains were found Feb. 15 in an steamer trunk kept by the
late Martha C. Shields in the basement of her home in this small
town about eight miles south of Baltimore. The skeleton was wrapped
in blankets, along with a Bible, a small chest and the remnants of a
baby girl's white dress.
   Mrs. Shields' children, Robert, 29, and Joyce, 31, told state
police that they made the discovery Feb. 15 when they opened the
trunk expecting to find their mother's will.
   When the two were young, their mother had warned them never to
play near the trunk, they said. Before she died Feb. 13 of a liver
ailment and other problems, the 67-year-old woman asked them to take
care of what was inside it, police said.
   Neither child could remember any family discussion of a sister
who died at birth or shortly afterward.
   Smialek said the examination of the remains did not determine
whether Mrs. Shields bore the child.
   Detective Michael E. Davey of the Maryland State Police said he
has drawn a blank on his investigation.
   ``Unless somebody comes forward, there is nothing more we can
do,'' he said. ``We can't even determine if a crime occurred.''

   Iran severed diplomatic relations with
Britain today and accused London of anti-Islamic ``treachery'' for
refusing to denounce Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iran's parliament had given Britain one week to lift Britain's
diplomatic embargo and ``clarify'' its stance on the book many
Moslems consider blasphemous.
   London blamed Tehran for the break. It comes after Britain
withdrew all its diplomats from Iran to protest Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's Feb. 14 religious edict calling on Moslems to kill
Rushdie for insulting Islam.
   ``The present situation is entirely of Iran's making,'' said a
Foreign Office statement. ``Incitement to murder is a violation of
the most elementary principles and obligations that govern relations
between sovereign states.''
   Iran did not formally communicate to Britain its decision to end
relations, the statement said.
   Relatives of Britons believed held hostage by pro-Iranian
radicals in Lebanon said they are saddened and dismayed by Iran's
move.
   ``Hostages' families all around the world will be upset that a
major player in this game is now out of the arena,'' said John
Waite, a cousin of missing Anglican envoy Terry Waite.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a Foreign
Ministry statement as saying: ``The world oppressors and the West,
which find genuine Islam against their objectives and plots, have
risen against Islam, and in this anti-Islamic campaign the role of
the British government is salient.
   ``In the past two centuries, Britain has been in the front line
of plots and treachery against Islam and Moslems.''
   Iranian clerics have put a bounty of $5.2 million on the head of
the author, a British citizen born to a Moslem family in India.
Rushdie, 41, went into hiding and is under police guard with his
wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins.
   Iran's threats prompted the 11 other European Economic Community
nations, and Norway, Sweden and Canada to recall their ambassadors
from Iran.
   A radical Palestinian group, the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command led by Ahmed Jibril, has
said it will kill Rushdie.
   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman
condemned the Palestinian threat.
   ``This terrorist group is based in Damascus and therefore ... we
call on Syria to take appropriate action,'' Redman said.
   In Vienna, British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe indicated
to reporters he wants the Soviet Union to take a stronger stand and
influence Iran to rescind the death threat.
   Howe said he and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
discussed the Rushdie affair in private talks Monday in Vienna.
   He told Shevardnadze ``there can be no justification for (Iran's)
incitement to murder ... and no justification for seeking to impair
the freedom of speech in a country like ours,'' Howe said.
   The Soviets have said Western countries are justified in their
indignation. They have not condoned the decree, but said Khomeini
may have had to act under Islamic teachings.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Saturday she
believes the novel has deeply offended Moslems, but her government
still insists Iran must revoke the death sentence before relations
can be normalized.
   Iran rejected Thatcher's statement of sympathy, saying it was
insufficient and suggesting London defuse the crisis by prosecuting
Rushdie and banning the novel. Britain refuses to do either.
   Moslems have objected to Rushdie's portrayal of the prophet
Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and the book's suggestion the Koran,
Islam's holy book, was not inspired by Allah.
   Rushdie has said his novel was meant to explore good and evil
secularly, and was not meant to insult Islam.
   Nineteen people have died in Pakistan and India in violence
related to the book.
   In Bangkok, Thailand, about 300 Moslems demonstrated against
Rushdie today outside the British Embassy, as their government
prepared to ban the novel.
   National Thai Police chief Gen. Pow Sarasin was to sign an order
today banning distribution and sale of the book, a police spokesman
said.

   Five children died when a bomb
resembling a toy exploded in a refugee village on Pakistan's border
with Afghanistan, a newspaper reported today.
   The independent English-language newspaper The Nation said a
sixth child was seriously injured in Monday's explosion.
   One of the children spotted an object that looked like a toy, and
when they picked it up, the object exploded, the Lahore newspaper
said, citing unidentified government officials.
   There was no immediate official comment on the report.
   More than 3 million Afghan war refugees live in Pakistan, which
has been the target of hundreds of bomb explosions. Most have ripped
through crowded bazaars in villages and cities in the Northwest
Frontier Province that borders Afghanistan.
   Most Afghan refugees live in tent villages and sprawling camps of
adobe huts in the border province.
   Local authorities charge Afghanistan's ruling communists are
behind the explosions. Many Afghan guerrilla groups are based in
Pakistan.
   A civil war has raged in Afghanistan since 1978. In December
1979, Soviet troops intervened to back the government, but the
Soviets withdrew all troops Feb. 15.

   An inmate serving a life sentence for
murder accidentally electrocuted himself by biting into an
electrical cord while sitting on a toilet, prison authorities said.
   ``It was a strange accident,'' said state Department of
Corrections spokesman Francis Archibald. ``He was sitting naked on a
metal commode.''
   Michael Anderson Godwin, 28, apparently was trying to repair
earphones to a television set when he bit into the cord, Archibald
said. A corrections officer making a routine check found him at 9:15
p.m. Sunday.
   Godwin was severely burned in his mouth and tongue, Richland
County Coroner Frank Barron said. It appears the electrocution was
accidental, he said.
   Inmates at the Central Correctional Institute are allowed to have
small televisions in their cells but must use earphones.
   Godwin was sentenced to death in 1981 for a murder and sexual
assault committed while he was on work release for a 1978 robbery
conviction, Archibald said. During a retrial he was found innocent
of the sexual assault and was resentenced to life in prison.

   Engineers today swapped out a faulty
electronic part on the space shuttle Discovery and NASA expressed
optimism it could hold the latest delay to two days and launch
Discovery on Monday.
   ``We're still pressing ahead toward a Monday launch at 8:07
a.m.'' said space agency spokesman Dick Young. But he said a firm
date could not be set until after the replacement unit was
thoroughly checked out, a task expected to take several hours.
   The launch, which had been set for Saturday after three earlier
postponements, received its latest setback on Monday when a
prelaunch test disclosed the failure of a ``Master Events
Controller,'' a vital system that commands separation of the booster
rockets and the external fuel tank from the shuttle in flight.
   Engineers replaced the failed unit with one borrowed from sister
ship Columbia and then had to postpone testing so that explosive
devices throughout the spaceship could be disarmed to avoid an
accidental firing.
   The explosives are fired in flight to separate such things as the
spacecraft from the launch pad and the booster rockets and external
fuel tank form the spaceship.
   Officials were worried that any extended delay could affect the
launch period for the high-priority Atlantis mission that is to
propel the Magellan probe out of Earth orbit toward Venus.
   NASA has said if Discovery, which is to carry five astronauts,
could not be launched by March 18, it might have to yield the pad to
Atlantis, set for liftoff April 28. If Magellan can't be launched
between that date and May 23, the planet will not in proper position
again until 1991.
   Discovery is to make the third shuttle flight since the
Challenger explosion killed seven astronauts more than three years
ago. During five days in orbit, the astronauts are supposed to
deploy a communications satellite and conduct scientific experiments.

   Hundreds of police and security guards
held back vengeful relatives today as a confessed North Korean agent
went on trial for the bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed
115 people.
   ``I`m here to kill you!'' shouted one person. ``Bring back my
husband!'' another screamed at Kim Hyon Hui as security agents led
her into the courtroom.
   She buried her face in her hands and sobbed.
   In January 1988, she admitted on South Korean television that she
planted a bomb disguised as a radio and liquor on the Boeing 707 in
November 1987 to disrupt last summer's Olympic Games in Seoul. She
also told the court today she had been a North Korean agent.
   The Korean Air plane flying from Baghdad to Seoul disappeared
over the Andaman Sea as it approached the Burmese coast. All 115
passengers and crew were lost.
   North Korea denies it had anything to do with the bomb.
   About 1,500 police and security agents guarded the court today to
prevent disruption from relatives and possible threats from North
Korean agents.
   Crying and sobbing relatives among a few allowed into the
courtroom interrupted the hearing repeatedly, demanding the
defendant's death. Twenty security agents surrounded her.
   Some relatives shouted claims that Kim actually was a South
Korean agent used by the government to discredit the north and stir
up support for the Seoul administration.
   Prosecutor Ahn Kang-min reviewed Kim's life story, questioning
her about her training as a North Korean intelligence agent. The
accused sat slumped forward, replying ``yes'' to all the questions.
   The defendant repeated an earlier statement that she received the
order to blow up the plane through a top Communist Party official
who said he acted for Kim Jung Il, son and political heir of North
Korean leader Kim Il Sung.
   Ahn presented charges of mass murder, destruction of an aircraft
and violation of national security and civil aviation laws.
   The court adjourned until March 21, when defense lawyers will
present their case.
   Court sources who declined to be identified said the woman
probably will be saved from the death sentence because she allegedly
was duped by North Korean intelligence.
   The bomber has said North Korean officials fooled her into
believing South Korea was a police state, but she realized she was
duped after she was brought to Seoul.
   Other captured North Korean intelligence operatives have been
pardoned and used as propaganda symbols against the north.
   The defendant and an elderly man who helped her plant the bomb
were arrested shortly after the blast in Bahrain. They tried to take
cyanide hidden in cigarettes. The other agent died. Kim recovered
and was extradited.
   South Korea successfully hosted the Olympics last September.
Communist North Korea boycotted after it unsuccessfully demanding to
be a co-host of the Games, which it saw as a major political coup
for Seoul.
   The two Koreas have been enemies since the division of the Korean
peninsula in 1945.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl today called on
the Soviet Union to remove its chemical weapons from Eastern Europe,
a day after the United States said it wanted to speed their removal
from West Germany.
   ``The United States has taken a step that the Soviet Union and
its allies should now follow without delay,'' Kohl said.
   ``I call on the Soviet Union, in turn, to pull out its chemical
weapons stationed in Eastern Europe and to destroy them,'' Kohl said
in a statement issued to the news media.
   On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
President Bush is exploring ways to accelerate the removal of aging
U.S. chemical weapons from West Germany.
   ``The United States is prepared to lead in dealing with this
problem,'' Baker said.
   Kohl said he was hopeful that the weapons could be withdrawn
ahead of a 1992 deadline agreed upon by both sides in 1986.
   Government officials said Monday the weapons would be removed and
destroyed in the United States.

   Rain, sleet and snow pelted the East, threatening to push streams
over their banks in already drenched North Carolina today after
heavy snow forced the closure of the Missouri Legislature and
stopped the mail in Oklahoma.
   The weather was blamed for at least 24 deaths, with nine in
Missouri, including three people who collapsed after shoveling snow.
   The storm caused millions of dollars in damage to poultry
operations in a four-state region as poultry houses collapsed under
the weight of the snow.
   The bad weather also forced President Bush to cancel a trip today
to Lancaster, Pa., and Wilmington, Del.
   Up to 10 inches of snow kept some schools in southern Illinois
closed today. Schools also were closed today in parts of Delaware,
Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., because of icy
roads.
   A storm system over North Carolina brought rain and snow to the
Atlantic seaboard early today. Snow extended from the mid-Atlantic
Coast to southern New England and the Ohio Valley.
   ``The ground is very wet and saturated,'' said Dennis Decker, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Raleigh, N.C.
``It won't take much in the way of additional rain to produce a
quick rise on some of the smaller creeks and streams.''
   Rain caused flooding across southern West Virginia, closing roads
in 14 counties, and in Tennessee, about 120 families were forced to
evacuate from along the swollen Cumberland and Harpeth rivers.
   In Pennsylvania, the Monongahela River crested at 6.3 feet above
flood stage this morning at Charleroi and also overflowed at
Braddock, Elizabeth and McKeesport. ``There is some damage at these
levels, most often to warehouses or storage areas along the river
and roads,'' said weather service hydrologist Aldo Angelo.
   The heaviest snowfalls _ 16 inches _ were recorded in parts of
Missouri and Oklahoma. Up to 10 inches covered the Laurel Mountains
of western Pennsylvania on Monday.
   The Missouri Legislature canceled Monday's and this morning's
sessions because of the storm.
   Nine inches of snow snarled traffic in Tulsa, Okla., prompting
even the intrepid U.S. Postal Service to call off most deliveries
Monday.
   ``Today our rule of thumb is, if the carriers can deliver by
walking from the station they will. If they have to drive, forget
it,'' said Bob Hunt, director of city operations for the U.S. Postal
Service.
   Ice on Interstate 35 north of Denton, Texas, caused a 20-mile
long traffic tieup this morning.
   Icy runways forced Cincinnati's Lunken Airport, which handles
mostly commuter and private flights, to continue diverting arriving
flights elsewhere.
   The St. Louis area received 11 inches of snow, the third largest
accumulation for a 24-hour period in March since record-keeping
began in 1874.
   That prompted election officials in St. Louis to ask a judge to
postpone today's primary for a week. The request was turned down by
Municipal Judge Evelyn Baker, who looked out an office window Monday
afternoon and noticed that the snow had stopped.
   Government officials said reports indicated that as many as 700
poultry houses in southwest Missouri, northwest Arkansas, northeast
Oklahoma and southeast Kansas were damaged.
   ``This could be the single biggest disaster ever to hit the
poultry industry,'' said Lynch Butler, president of Simmons
Industries Inc., of Siloam Springs, Ark., which processes about 1.5
million chickens a week.
   ``We've suffered major losses in summer heat waves, but I'm not
aware of a single larger loss in terms of property and I've been in
this business for 20 years.''
   Weather-related deaths included one in Georgia, five in Oklahoma,
two in Ohio, one in Arkansas, two in Alabama, from a fire started by
lightning, nine in Missouri, one in Pennsylvania and three in
Maryland.
   Icy pavement and blowing snow hampered travel in many areas. The
weather slowed commuters in the New York City area who had thought
they were home free Monday after a judge barred ``sympathy''
walkouts by railroad workers in support of striking Eastern Airlines
workers.
   The weather service said 2.7 inches fell Monday in Newark, N.J.,
breaking the record for the date of 2.4 inches set in 1943.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze agreed today that
Baker would visit Moscow in May and discuss the possibility of a
superpower summit meeting.
   Baker also told Shevardnadze that the Bush administration would
complete its review of its strategic nuclear arms policy next month
and afterward a date might be set for the resumption of negotiations
to slash missile arsenals.
   ``I am pleased with this meeting,'' Shevardnadze told reporters
outside the residence of U.S. Ambassador to Austria Henry Grunwald.
``I believe ... that there will be good cooperation between us.
Maybe this is the most important conclusion.''
   Shevardnadze said the Moscow meeting with Baker would be used to
discuss the future agenda for the superpowers and ``the prospects
for a summit meeting.''
   But Baker, speaking after Shevardnadze, also stressed some sharp
differences between the two sides.
   He objected specifically to the Soviets' proposal to try to curb
NATO and Warsaw Pact battlefield nuclear missiles in new arms
control negotiations that open Thursday and on a Soviet drive to
hold a Mideast peace conference.
   ``The situation cries out for some hard work on the ground,''
Baker said in explaining why he did not think the time was right to
try to get Israel and the Arabs together at the table.
   On the combat aircraft issue, Baker noted the mandate for the
arms talks specifically exclude battlefield nuclear weapons and
naval forces, which Shevardnadze said Monday would have to be the
subject of negotiations in the future.
   Baker also said he took issue with what he called recent ``Soviet
posturing on Iran.'' He declined, however, to specify what his
objections were to Soviet policy toward Iran, where Shevardnadze
recently paid a visit.
   Iran's relations with the West have chilled over the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's death threat against Salman Rushdie, author of
the novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems consider
blasphemous.
   In his speech to the current 35-nation Foreign Ministers'
conference Monday, Shevardnadze said there ''should be no playing on
contradictions'' such as ``the West's difficulties with Iran.''
   A U.S. official, briefing reporters under rules that barred
identifying him, later called that remark snide. It was evidence of
old thinking rather than the new dogma the Kremlin professes now
guide its foreign policy, the official said, suggesting the Soviet
Union should condemn Iran's death threat against Rushdie.
   The two men met for 67 minutes alone with their interpreters.
Their delegations then joined them for a further hour.
   On the strategic arms negotiations that were due to resume in
February but remain suspended, Baker said the United States would
complete its policy review by the end of April.
   This will pave the way to set a date for the resumption of the
talks at the Moscow meeting with Shevardnadze, Baker said.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviets had suggested April or May as firm
dates for the resumption of the strategic arms-reduction talks.
   On the differences between East and West proposals for the new
conventional arms control talks, Shevardnadze also noted significant
gaps between the two positions but added: ``Negotiation is
negotiation. It is a complex process and I believe that in this
process we will be able to find mutually acceptable decisions.''
   The new round of arms-reduction negotiations formally begins
Thursday, bringing together all 16 nations of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and the seven Soviet-led Warsaw Pact countries.
   On Monday, Shevardnadze outlined a three-phase proposal that
calls for both sides to eliminate imbalances in their forces and
then further reduce troops and major weapons systems by 10 to 15
percent over the next two to three years.
   The broad Soviet proposals seemed certain to open up splits
between the United States and other NATO allies. Kremlin reforms and
Moscow's apparent new willingness to disarm have already led some
west Europeans to question the purpose of the Western military
alliance.
   NATO has said it wants to retire at least 25,000 Warsaw Pact
tanks. Only then would both sides reduce armor, artillery and
personnel carriers by 5-10 percent.
   The Western alliance says the Warsaw Pact has at least a 2-to-1
edge in tanks and artillery, even after President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's pledge in last December to unilaterally remove 5,000
tanks and 50,000 men from eastern Europe by 1991.

   One of three city judges charged after a federal
bribery investigation pleaded guilty today in a deal that set her
maximum sentence at five years in prison, court officials said.
   Recorder's Judge Evelyn Cooper was to have gone on trial today in
U.S. District Court on charges of accepting $9,000 in bribes to fix
two criminal cases and arrange for a convict's early release. The
indictment also charged her with failing to report income from the
bribes.
   Cooper, 47, pleaded guilty to one count of extortion of $5,000
and to signing a false tax return for 1984, said a court spokeswoman
who would not give her name.
   Cooper had faced 20 years in prison if convicted of bribery, and
three years for filing a false tax return. No sentencing date was
set.
   In the other bribery cases, a state district judge is serving a
10-year sentence and another judge was acquitted last week of four
bribery charges but a mistrial was declared on a racketeering charge.

<HEAD>Marxist PLO Leader Vows to Escalate Struggle Against Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a Marxist PLO faction today
said his group would increase guerrilla attacks against Israel,
saying such actions were not included in the Palestine Liberation
Organization's renunciation of terrorism.
   George Habash, leader of the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, told a news conference ``there is no
resolution (by the Palestine National Council) ... providing for a
truce in south Lebanon between us and the Israelis.''
   He said his guerrillas ``will not only keep up the armed
struggle, but also will escalate it and diversify its forms and
methods.'' He did not elaborate.
   His organization is the second-largest faction of the PLO after
Yasser Arafat's Fatah.
   In December, the United States ended a 13-year ban on public
contacts with the PLO and initiated dialogue with PLO chief Arafat
after he renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   Arafat's announcement was more explicit than a statement issued
by the Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, in
November.
   Arafat, like Habash, has said military operations against Israel
were not considered terrorist acts. But he recently indicated he
would be willing to negotiate a truce in south Lebanon.
   Washington has said guerrilla attacks in south Lebanon could have
a negative impact on the U.S.- PLO dialogue. There has been no
progress in the talks since President Bush took over in January.
   Since December, guerrillas have clashed three times with Israeli
troops and their allies in south Lebanon. Ten guerrillas have been
killed in the shootouts, but no Israelis have been hurt.
   Israeli officials have said that in all three cases, the
guerrillas were planning to infiltrate into Israel, but were
uncovered while still in Israel's self-designated security zone in
south Lebanon. Israel set up the buffer in 1985 when it removed the
bulk of its forces, three years after invading Lebanon.
   Israeli jets have struck Palestinian targets in Lebanon three
times this year, killing two guerrillas and wounding 34 people.

   At a White House news conference called after a snow and ice
storm forced cancellation of a quick presidential trip to
Wilmington, Del., and Lancaster, Pa., Bush said free collective
bargaining, not a government-imposed strike delay, is the best way
of resolving the Eastern strike.
   The airline has cancelled virtually all of its flights because
few pilots have crossed the picket lines set up by machinists
beginning at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
   Bush spoke as congressional Democrats pressed for action by the
White House to stop the strike. ``I still feel that the best answer
is a head on head, man to man negotiation between the union and the
airline,'' the president said.
   The president said a government-imposed settlement could cause
the airline to shut down totally. Bush refused to invoke a 60-day
delay that could have blocked the walkout temporarily.
   The strikers had threatened to set up picket lines to disrupt
rail and other transportation. Bush said he would urge Congress to
act if that happened. He said it isn't fair for a rail commuter on
Long Island to be caught up an an airline strike.
   As for the poilots' slowdown on other airlines, Bush said he
recognized their concerns about safety during the Eastern walkout,
but told them they should not make ``the innocent traveling public a
pawn in this dispute.''

   The judge in the Oliver North case has leveled
scathing criticism of the government's handling of memos written by
Robert Owen, North's courier to the Contras.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell issued an order saying that
government intelligence experts sometimes classify material which is
already being accurately reported in the news media. Gesell
concluded in the order that he may disregard claims of
classification that are ``frivolous.''
   The judge's six-page memorandum issued Monday denies a motion by
North's lawyers to dismiss the indictment against the fired White
House aide, but it is a strong attack on government procedures for
classifying information.
   On Feb. 27, North's lawyers were notified by Owen's attorney that
uncensored versions of classified memos by Owen on the Contras had
been turned over last June to a private group in a civil suit.
   North's lawyers were using some of the memos to cross-examine
Owen on the witness stand and were seeking to disclose some of the
names in the censored memos. Names of foreign officials and
intelligence operatives were blacked out.
   Owen's lawyer told North's attorneys he had told prosecutors on
Feb. 10 in the office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh about
the memos becoming public. Informed at the time were office security
chief Allen Stansbury, prosecutor Michael Bromwhich and another
attorney in the office. Stansbury asked Owen's lawyer to turn over
the memos, but he refused and no one in Walsh's office took any
further action until Feb. 27 when the private group, the Christic
Institute, announced its intention to publicize the uncensored text
of the memos.
   Stansbury ``made only a half-hearted attempt to retrieve copies
of the memoranda,'' said Gesell. ``He made no attempt to retrieve
them from the Christic Institute.''
   Stansbury's ``boss at the Department of Justice was out of town
and he simply did not act,'' said the judge. ``He never advised
trial counsel of his inaction and he never pursued his authority to
resolve the matter one way or the other. He proved incompetent for
the task assigned to him.''
   Bromwich ``also failed to follow up. ... He let the matter slip
his mind under the pressure of trial preparation.''
   Gesell said that with regard to classifying material, the
executive branch ``has frequently ignored the requirements'' set out
in a presidential executive order.
   ``It is now abundantly clear that many documents that should have
been classified from the outset were not classified in any way, at
certain agencies such as the National Security Council and
Department of State,'' said the judge. ``No effort was even
attempted to follow precise directives found in the Executive Order,
either by the agencies or by the interagency group'' of intelligence
experts.
   ``This has resulted in a haphazard process of review of
non-classified materials to determine what can now be released
publicly,'' said the judge. Gesell said the conscientious work of
the interagency group of classifying and declassifying at the same
time ``has created uncertainty as to the status of many papers.''
   He said the Owen memos reflect ``difficulties that arise when
necessary procedures for control of national security data are
observed in the breach. Among other things, it leads to the often
absurd situation where the press is accurately reporting information
in the public domain while the court is confronted with
representations that the same facts must never be officially
acknowledged.''
   Gesell noted that the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.,
in a case involving accused terrorist Fawas Younis, concluded that
the court may disregard claims of classification that are frivolous.
   ``The court will do so hereafter should an occasion warrant,''
concluded Gesell.
   Meanwhile, prosecutors are outlining North's links with a
conservative activist convicted of illegal fund-raising for the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The case lost a round to the weather today as snow and freezing
rain here forced a suspension in the trial along with other
proceedings in U.S. District Court.
   Carl ``Spitz'' Channell testified Monday about how he set up a
foundation, which eventually was used to solicit tax-exempt
contributions for the guerrillas fighting the leftist government of
Nicaragua.
   Channell was convicted in April 1987 of conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service by illegally using the tax-exempt
foundation to support Contra military activities. One of the 12
criminal charges against North, a White House aide at the time, is
that he helped in the fund-raising effort.
   Channell said that in 1985 he succeeded in getting two letters
from Contra leader Adolfo Calero authorizing him to be a fund-raiser.
   Channell's group, the National Endowment for the Preservation of
Liberty, used White House briefings and private meetings with
President Reagan to persuade private contributors to make donations.
It raised more than $10 million.

   Electing a successor to socialist Bernie
Sanders as Burlington's mayor, a push to bring back the death
penalty and a host of environmental issues were on the agenda today
as Vermont observed its annual Town Meeting Day.
   Voters braved wind chills of 43 degrees below zero to travel to
their local town halls and settle affairs for another year.
   In Burlington, turnout was described as light to moderate.
``Maybe their cars, some of them probably wouldn't start this
morning,'' said Jean Poulin, an office assistant in City Clerk James
Rader's office.
   Burlington, population 38,000 and the nearest thing Vermont has
to a big city, will be choosing between a liberal Democrat and two
candidates further to the left to replace Sanders.
   The 47-year-old mayor, nationally known for outraged rhetoric
against American corporate capitalism, is taking leave from
politics, at least temporarily, to teach and write.
   Peter Clavelle, who eschews the socialist label but is running
under the banner of Sanders' Progressive Coalition, is favored to
win over Democrat Nancy Chioffi and Greens party candidate Sandra
Baird.
   Clavelle initially angered many Sanders backers by ducking even
the Progressive label, calling himself only an ``independent'' in
his first batch of campaign literature. But lately he has more
clearly articulated the activist politics he helped execute as chief
of the Community Economic Development Office under Sanders.
   In about three dozen towns around Vermont, residents will be
voting on a non-binding resolution asking the Legislature to
reinstate the death penalty, last used in the 1950s.
   On Monday night, at least six towns approved the death penalty
resolution. It was tabled in one community and rejected in three,
including Rockingham, where residents said they were afraid of
sending an innocent person to the electric chair.
   At least nine towns will decide whether to form environmental
conservation commissions. Nine communities already have such boards,
which are volunteer groups created to protect a town's natural
resources.
   In several other communities, voters may authorize selectmen to
create funds with local taxes to protect land resources such as
farmland, waterfront property and scenic areas.
   Several towns approved resolutions expressing worries about a
proposed pipeline to bring natural gas from western Canada through
New England. In Rockingham, where the proposed line would go through
a historic cemetery and two church parking lots, residents approved
a resolution to examine the safety and economic need for the line.
   In Hartford, residents approved a resolution giving them a say if
the state tries to locate a proposed 15,000-seat sports and arts
complex in their town. Proponents want the complex to keep the Volvo
International Tennis Tournament in the state.

   Bush defended anew his choice of John Tower for defense
secretary, saying, ``I'm not going to pull back on this.''
   He repeated three times that a president has the right to choose
members of his Cabinet.
   Bush said he believed Tower would keep his pledge not to take
another alcoholic drink if confirmed. ``He said he'd never touch
another drop of liquor and you'll have 25,000 people in the Pentagon
making sure that's true,'' the president said.
   On another topic, Bush dismissed a reporter's suggestion that his
administration had gotten off to a slow start.
   He said the administration is not ``adrift'' and there is ``no
malaise'' in the White House.
   Bush ticked off a list of administration initiatives: a proposal
to deal with ``a serious national problem'' _ the crisis in the
savings and loan industry; his budget proposals; his five-day trip
to Japan, China and South Korea during which he conferred with 19
foreign leaders; his administration's forthcoming proposals for
dealing with chemicals which accelerate ``the greenhouse effect;''
his drug adviser's forthcoming recommendations; his ethics
commission's forthcoming report; his housing secretary's
fact-finding trips and his forthcoming proposals on child care.
   ``I will not be stampeded by some talk that we have not come up
with some bold new foreign policy proposals in 45 days,'' Bush said.

   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa today met
with Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak and later reported progress in
monthlong negotiations between the opposition and communist
government.
   He announced the last session of the talks would be held April 3,
and various working groups composed of experts will finish putting
the final touches on the accord by March 20.
   The period between March 20 and April 3 would be devoted to
reviewing the agreement, he said.
   ``All basic problems, like pluralism, ... will be achieved in
time, in line with our commitments,'' said the Solidarity leader,
looking cheerful after the eight-hour meeting with the leader of the
government side in the talks. ``I am very satisfied.''
   Walesa indicated agreement was reached on legalizing the three
main banned independent organizations at issue in the talks _ the
Solidarity trade union movement, the farmers' union Rural Solidarity
and the Independent Students Association.
   Agreements on ``all those organizations, a mininum of three''
will be achieved, he said.
   He said further talks with Kiszczak might be necessary.
   ``We are removing obstacles that have appeared here and there.
But we are only removing them politically, and the rest must be
worked out at the (various working group) tables,'' he said.
   Walesa spoke outside the Roman Catholic episcopate in Warsaw
after returning with a vanful of advisers from the meeting in a
secluded government villa outside the capital.
   The session came the morning after a Communist Party session that
gave Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski qualified support for his policy of
rapprochement with the opposition, government spokesman Jerzy Urban
said in a telephone interview.
   Urban described Monday's meeting of the party's governing Central
Committee as ``very difficult.''
   He said committee members ``expressed different fears and doubts,
remembering the events of 1981,'' when Solidarity grew in membership
to include one of every three Poles and pressed its demands with
general strike threats.
   Authorities suppressed the free trade union movement in a
December 1981 military crackdown, ending its 16-month legal
existence.
   ``The general outcome of the meeting (Monday) was approval for
the party leadership,'' Urban said.
   Walesa and the interior minister also met Thursday and agreed
that the talks, aimed at restoring the Solidarity's legal status and
producing a consensus for guiding the country out of economic
turmoil, should move more quickly.
   The two sides are in general agreement on the outlines of a
national compromise: legalization of Solidarity in exchange for the
opposition's participation in early elections that would guarantee
the ruling Communist Party a continued majority in parliament.
   But several obstacles have appeared, including the authorities'
hesitation to legalize the Independent Students' Association,
disagreement over a program to index wages to inflation and how much
access the opposition is to be given to the state-controlled mass
media.

   A car bomb exploded near the American
University Hospital in Moslem west Beirut today, killing two women
and injuring 21 people, police said.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, a staunch ally of the Syrians who
police west Beirut, blamed the blast on the Christian cabinet of
Gen. Michel Aoun.
   The explosive-laden yellow Fiat blew up in front of a fruit and
vegetable stall at an intersection off a main commercial
thoroughfare.
   One of the victims was killed as she maneuvered to park her car
near the stand, police said.
   Another woman died at the hospital, said a police spokesman, who
under standing regulations is not identified.
   The explosion started a fire involving several parked cars and
shattered glass in surrounding buildings.
   Three people were evacuated by ambulance, and the police
spokesman said ``civilians carried most of the casualties on their
backs to the American University hospital,'' several hundered yards
away.
   Jumblatt charged at a news conference that the bomb was part of a
campaign by the Christian cabinet to choke private militias in
Lebanon.
   ``Those who are trying to encircle us, today sent us a
booby-trapped message,'' Jumblatt told a news conference at his
family's ancestral palace in Mukhtara, southeast of Beirut.
   Tensions between Lebanon's rival Christian and Moslem cabinets
have increased since Monday, when Aoun ordered the army to block
merchant ships trying to dock at militia-controlled ports instead of
those run by the government.
   Aoun has said his move will cut off the main revenues of private
armies. But his Syrian-backed Moslem rivals view it as an economic
blockade of Moslem regions.
   At the scene of the blast, a witness who also spoke on condition
of anonymity said he was in a building 150 feet away when the blast
occurred. It shattered windows there.
   ``I was having my coffee. First, I felt the glass crumbling down,
then I heard the blast.''
   He said when he looked out of the window, he saw fires and a body
lying in the street.
   Gunmen fired their rifles in the air to make way for the
ambulances.
   It was the fourth car bombing in Lebanon this year.
   By police count, 11 people have been killed and 47 wounded in the
previous three car bombings since Jan. 13.
   Last year, 116 people were killed and 488 wounded in 20 car bomb
explosions across the country, plagued by a 14-year-old civil war.
   No group claimed any of the explosions, but Moslem and Christian
officials have blamed each other's militias for them.

<HEAD>Soviet Nuclear-Powered Refused Three Port Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Soviet Far Eastern ports, wary of nuclear
power after the Chernobyl disaster, have refused to allow the
docking of a nuclear-powered merchant ship that a newspaper today
compared to a ``homeless child.''
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said the 858-foot-long Sevmorput has been
anchored off Vladivostok for four days because the City Council
refused it entry. The newspaper said city officials will not allow
the ship to dock until they receive additional information about its
radiation safety.
   Officials of the Pacific port of Nakhodka and the coastal Magadan
region have also rejected port calls by the ship, the newspaper said.
   The newspaper said fractures recently appeared in the $260
million ship, but that its ``atomic heart'' was not damaged. It did
not say how the damage was inflicted.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said the vessel was like a ``sea monster''
and a huge ``offended homeless child.''
   On Saturday, the newspaper Vodny Transport reported that a
nuclear reactor meltdown nearly occurred last fall aboard another
nuclear-powered ship, the icebreaker Rossiya.
   Public opposition to nuclear power has been mounting in the
Soviet Union since the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Ukraine. At least 31 people
were killed in the accident, and a cloud of radiation spread
worldwide.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's news
conference Tuesday.
   Bush: Well, as you know, we got canceled out of Lancaster, Pa.,
and Wilmington today, and so I thought it might be an opportune
moment to stay indoors, take a few questions.
   The Lancaster trip has been rescheduled for the 22nd of March,
and I look forward to going there, talking to the people and really
discussing that community participation on drugs.
   I want to take this brief opening statement opportunity to
restate my belief that free collective bargaining is the best means
of resolving the dispute between Eastern Airlines and its unions.
   I continue to feel it would be inappropriate for the government
to intervene and to impose a solution.
   This dispute has gone on for more than 17 months, and it's time
for the parties involved to get down to serious business and reach
an agreement.
   The action-forcing event in this case is the strike, and that is
the tool at the disposal of labor, and they're properly going
forward with that.
   Management and labor now have to find a settlement.
   But let me just say that I hope my position on secondary boycotts
is well known.
   Thankfully, these boycotts have not yet materialized, and I hope
they don't.
   Temporary restraining orders have been in effect yesterday and
today in the New York and Philadelphia areas.
   But even when those restraining orders lapse, I remind all
parties that secondary boycotts are not in the public interest, and
I will send legislation to Congress to forbid them, if that is
necessary.
   It is not fair to say to a commuter on a train coming in from
Long Island, that you're going to be caught up and victimized by a
strike affecting an airline.
   It simply isn't fair in my view.
   Secretary Skinner has been monitoring the situation from the very
beginning.
   In my view _ on top of it.
   The Department of Transportation and the FAA have taken every
precaution to ensure airline safety during this period.
   And I understand that the pilots are talking about a work
slowdown beginning today.
   Certainly, I must recognize their special concerns for safety
during this period, but I also would urge them not to make the
traveling public, the innocent traveling public, a pawn in this
dispute.
   So, that's my view on the airline strike.
   And I hope that it is settled in the traditional way _
management, labor sitting down and working out an agreement.

<TEXT>
   Wait a minute, we've got to go to the _
   Q. Oh!
   A. Protocol. Sorry about that.
   Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, your struggle to win
the confimation of Senator Tower and the seeming lack of direction
has caused a lot criticism that your administration is in drift,
there is malaise. What is your response and what are you going to do
about it?
   A. My response is that it's not a drift and there isn't malaise.
   And I talked to a fellow from Lubbock, Texas, the other day which
was the best phone call I've made.
   And he said, ``All the people in Lubbock think things are going
just great.''
   And so _ and he is a very objective spokesman _ (laughter) _ the
guy that _ huh?
   Q. Do you really think you're doing fine when you _
   A. I think we're on track.
   Q. _ don't really know where your administration is going with a
plan?
   A. Well, let me help you with where I think it's going.
   In the first place, in a very brief period of time, we addressed
ourselves to a serious national problem, the problem of the S&amp;L
bailout.
   That is still moving forward.
   It takes a little time.
   I've challenged the Congress to act.
   Secondly, we came up in a very short period of time with a great
amount of detail, far more than the two previous administrations,
regarding the budget; sound proposals.
   The No. 1 problem facing this country, in my view, is getting
this federal budget deficit down.
   Not only did we address it, but we addressed it in considerable
detail and talks are going on right now to try to solve that problem.
   I've taken a substantive foreign policy trip that took me not
only to three countries, but where I met with, I think, some 19
representatives of 19 countries and talked about their objectives
and mine for foreign policy.
   Our secretary of state has not only touched base with all the
NATO leaders but has had a productive meeting with Mr. Shevardnadze.
   The defense reviews and the other foreign policy reviews are
under way.
   And I will not be stampeded by some talk that we have not come up
with bold new foreign policy proposals in 45 days; not going to be.
   So I think plenty of substantive things are going on.
   And then I have made clear _ you saw my statement on CFCs on the
environment.
   Our environmental man is over there, Bill Reilly, a very able
administrator, attending a conference that will then lead, in my
view, to unilateral proposals by the United States _ not in terms
just of CFCs, but other global environmental matters.
   We are confident of the confirmation of Bill Bennett, and he is
charged with a six-month mandate to do something _ map out the drug
program.
   And he will be very serious about going forward on that.

<TEXT>
   I appointed early on an ethics commission, which has been
meeting, and will be coming out with, I think, sound proposals.
   And so we'll start moving forward legislatively there.
   I spelled out in my speech an education agenda, and that will be
followed, the speech, very shortly with legislative initiatives.
   We're moving forward with our volunteer approach, this national _
the organization to pursue national service under Greg Petersmeyer
here in the White House.
   Our secretary of HUD has taken some fact-finding speeches _ trips
_ and made some good comments, speeches, about our objectives in
terms of the homeless.
   So I would have to urge _ and everyone here is familiar with my
position on child care, that's going to take legislation, but I
think the Congress clearly knows where we want to go there.
   So I would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be
bubbling around, that nothing is happening.
   A lot is happening _ not all of it good, but a lot is happening.
   Q. Mr. President, you mentioned your Asian trip. Now, one of the
issues that arose there was kind of a disagreement or a dispute with
China over a dissident attending your dinner. And it seems that you
failed to raise human rights in your meetings with Chinese leaders.
Is this going to be your preference, for conveying harmony rather
than confrontation over human rights?
   A. No, it was raised.
   When Marlin spoke to you at the beginning of the trip there in
China and said it hadn't been raised, he was right.
   It hadn't been raised publicly in the meetings with _ that I'd
had up to that moment.
   I believe Deng Xiaoping was the one where he spoke.
   But it was raised by me personally.
   But you know, there's two schools of how you do the human rights
agenda.
   I think that President Reagan was correct when he raised the
human rights agenda with the Soviets privately rather than beating
his breast and doing it publicly.
   And I think the results have been rather penetrating.
   There's still a long way to go with the Soviets.
   But I have not only raised them, but the very invitation to that
dissident, that they thoroughly disapproved of, shows our public
commitment to it.
   And there was a reference to it in his speech.
   So it all depends how you _ how _ in our toasts.
   So, it all depends, you know, what approach you take.
   But I think quiet discussion is a good approach to trying to
effect the human rights objectives that I feel very strongly about.
   Craig?

<HEAD>Bush Says He's Open to Sensible Answer on Problem of Assault Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he is open to a
``sensible answer'' to the proliferation of semiautomatic assault
weapons and has asked William Bennett, his nominee for drug policy
coordinator, to work on it.
   Bush, a member of the National Rifle Association, has said he
opposes a ban on such guns. In a news conference today, he said he
talked to Bennett about the problem after Bennett was quoted as
saying he might favor curtailment of such weapons as a way to cut
down on drug-related violence.
   Bush said he told Bennett: ``I'm not so rigid that if you come to
me with a sensible answer that takes care of the concerns that I've
felt over the years, I'll take a hard look at it, and I'll work with
you to that end.''
   He said he wants to find ``what can be worked out with finality
on AK47s ... and still do what's right by the legitimate sportsman.''
   ``It isn't as easy as it seems,'' Bush said.
   Bush was to have gone to Pennsylvania today to speek on drugs,
but the trip was scrapped due to the icy and snowy weather that
battered the East Coast.
   On Monday, Bush began a week devoted to an anti-drug message,
appealing to military veterans to help combat narcotics by
encouraging drug-education programs and anti-drug legislation at the
state and local levels.
   ``You've fought for your nation once and your nation needs you
again,'' Bush said in an address Monday to several thousand people
at a Veterans of Foreign Wars conference.
   Bush has asked Congress for $5.5 billion for the battle against
drugs, with most of the money going to law enforcement efforts and
border interdiction.
   His request for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 is 21 percent
more than the $4.6 billion allocated for this year. It is $236
million more than former President Ronald Reagan had sought in his
first draft of the spending plan.
   Bush told the veterans that drugs were ``a threat no less real
than the adversaries you have battled.''
   ``The notion that America is a nation at peace is only partly
true, as long as the violence and destructive power of drugs assault
our communities,'' he said.
   Bush said he will ``mobilize all our resources, wage this war on
all fronts. We're going to combat drug abuse with education,
treatment, enforcement ... interdiction and, yes, with our nation's
armed services.''
   Speaking of involvement by the military, Bush said, ``when that
prudently can be done and when that's what it takes, we are going to
have to go all out.''
   Bush had planned to carry his anti-drug message today to
Pennsylvania and Delaware, but a storm along the East Coast caused
him to cancel the trip. White House aides said it would be
rescheduled, probably for next week.
   On another subject, Bush said Monday that he supports ``lower
levels of armaments'' in Europe but with a continued backup by
nuclear weapons.
   ``For America and its allies, a survivable nuclear force will
remain the ultimate deterrent of aggression,'' Bush said.
   His comments coincided with a proposal by the Kremlin for heavy
reductions in troops and armor in Europe. Moscow also urged
negotiations to eliminate all battlefield nuclear weapons from the
continent.

   Q. On that regard, on human rights, will it always be the first
thing you mention with the Soviets, as it was under President Reagan?
   A. I don't recall it always being the first thing, because the
last meeting I attended with him and Mr. Gorbachev it was raised,
but it wasn't the first thing.
   But it will be high on our agenda.
   I confidently expect that Jim Baker will continue to raise it.
   And yes, it will be an agenda item.
   Q. Mr. President, on the air strike, your opposition on Capitol
Hill, many of the Democrats up there, wanted you to intervene in
this strike. Should you have to go to Congress for emergency
legislation to deal with secondary boycotts, it is likely they are
going to say, ``No, no. We want you to intervene first.'' If the
Eastern pilots succeed and the machinists succeed in imposing
secondary boycotts, you seem to be on a collision course there. Will
your policy hold firm?
   A. It will hold firm.
   The secretary is testifying, I think at this very moment, about
the kind of legislation you are talking about and some wanting to
compel the president to convene this board.
   So there are two schools of thought.
   I still feel that the best answer is a head-on-head, man-to-man
negotiation between the union and the airline.
   And I think that is better and more lasting, incidentally _ the
agreement that would stem from that _ more lasting than an imposed
government settlement which could cause the airline to totally shut
down.
   So I think there could be some, you know, confrontation.
   But I will stick with my view, and I will keep _ and if, indeed,
innocent parties are threatened through the secondary boycott
mechanism, I will move promptly with the Congress, and what would
happen, and I don't want to buy into a lot of hypothesis here, but
you would have an outcry from the American people on the basis of _
that I mentioned about that commuter.
   It is not fair to, you know, have innocent people victimized by a
struggle between Eastern Airlines and the Machinists union.
   So there may be a different _ a closely-fought contest, and there
might _ I know there's some widely differing views on this.
   Q. But if that should happen, sir, you must recognize that there
would be great pressure on you to at least stop it for 60 days. Are
you intent on not doing that?
   A. I am intent on staying with what I've outlined is our
administration's policy, and it is the correct policy.
   And I think it's the best way to have a solution to this question.
   We'll go right across here and then start _ greater than

   EASTERN STRIKE
   Bush urged pilots for other airlines not to slow operations as a
way of supporting the Eastern Airlines strike and thus ``make the
innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute.''
   The president stood by his opposition to government intervention
to stop the walkout, but he said that if striking machinists try to
shut down rail service he will ask Congress to ban such secondary
boycotts.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   TOWER NOMINATION
   Bush reiterated that he is determined to press his nomination of
John G. Tower to be secretary of defense to a showdown vote in the
Senate because ``I want him and I believe he is the best man for the
job.''
   He noted that Tower has pledged not to touch a drop of liquor if
he gets the defense job, and he said, ``You'll have 25,000 people in
the Pentagon making sure that's true.''
   Bush said that his backing of Tower against Democratic opposition
in the Senate ``isn't iron-willed stubbornness; it's a question of
fundamental principle here.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ARMS REDUCTION
   The president gave a preliminary welcome to the Soviet proposal,
made Monday at an East-West conference in Vienna, for a reduction in
conventional weapons and military personnel in Europe.
   Bush cautioned, however, that he had not yet seen Secretary of
State James A. Baker III's cabled report on the conference of
foreign ministers from NATO countries and Warsaw Pact nations.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SLOW START
   Bush said the Tower debate has not immobilized his
administration, as some critics are saying.
   He said the administration is not adrift, ``we're on track.''
   ``I will not be stampeded by some talk that we have not come up
with bold, new foreign policy proposals in 45 days,'' Bush said.

   CONTRA AID
   There is not much question that the Contra rebels in Nicaragua
will need additional aid, he said.
   ``We simply cannot and I will not leave the Contras out there
with no humanitarian aid at all,'' said Bush.

   GUN CONTROL
   He is willing to be flexible on action to limit sales of
automatic and semi-automatic weapons, but the issue is a complicated
one, he said. ``It isn't as easy as it seems for those who are

   Sweden's public telephone company next
year will offer computer terminals to households instead of
telephone directories, opening the way for services such as
electronic mail, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   Telephone company official Tor Krusell said the trial use of the
Videotex system, involving 100 households, was successful.
   ``About 30 percent liked it ... especially the opportunity to
look up telephone numbers anywhere in Sweden,'' Krusell said.
   Subscribers will be able to conduct bank transactions and order
taxis, airplane tickets and mail order goods through the system.
   They also can send a letter from one terminal-owner to another.
Delivery will take less than a second, compared with normal mail
delivery, which takes about a day within Sweden.
   Videotex already is being used by about 45,000 Swedish companies,
Krusell said.

   A living room set that graced the salon of Ludwig
Von Beethoven fetched about $8,333 on Tuesday as a leading Viennese
auction house joined a French auctioneer in selling 19th and 20th
century Austrian treasures.
   The furniture was owned by Beethoven until his death in 1827 and
was part of his estate. French Auctioneer Jacques Tajan said the
five-piece ensemble was purchased by an American he declined to
identify.
   Built by the German Biedermeier school that was famous for
crafting functional and comfortable designs, the set consisted of a
love seat with a curved back and arms in solid walnut, three
fan-backed chairs covered in green felt, and a small laminated table.
   In an attempt to find new markets for Austrian art, Vienna's
centuries-old Dorotheum auction house collaborated with Tajan on the
sale. It was the first major auction of Austrian art objects in
Paris.
   Tajan said more than 300 items sold for a total of $833,000.
   ``It's not an overwhelming success, but it isn't bad either
considering that the French public is not familiar with Austrian
tastes,'' he said.

   A stowaway cat from Baltimore survived a
two-week journey by land and sea from the United States without food
or water _ only to be killed when it arrived in Britain because of
strict quarantine laws, an official said Tuesday.
   The cat apparently was locked in a container full of tires in
Baltimore, said John Mackie, Staffordshire county's emergency
planning officer.
   The container made the 3,000-mile journey to an auto factory in
Rocester, western England, by ship and truck.
   The long-haired, gray-and-white cat survived by drinking the
condensation on the inside of the sealed container, Mackie said.
   When it was discovered, however, a veterinarian decided it had to
be killed because of the rabies risk.
   ``The risk was slight, but rabies is endemic in the United States
and the import of cats and dogs is strictly controlled because of
it,'' Mackie said.
   The factory organized a collection to keep the cat in quarantine
for the required six months, but the vet declared the cat was in too
poor a condition to survive the quarantine period and he killed it
painlessly, Mackie said.

   North Korea accused South Korean troops of firing
machine guns Tuesday at a guard post on the North Korean side of the
border and contended it was part of attempts to start a new war.
   Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in
Tokyo, said the firing ``gravely threatened the safety of civilian
policemen of our side on routine duty,'' and said their patience
prevented the incident from developing into an armed conflict.
   It said the firing occurred Tuesday morning in the central sector
of the border area between North Korea and South Korea.
   ``The gun firing, timed to coincide with the aggressive `Team
Spirit '89' joint military maneuvers staged by the U.S. imperialists
and the South Korean puppets, shipping huge aggressive forces and
destruction weapons into South Korea, vividly shows how frantically
they are trying to unleash a new war by aggravating the situation on
the Korean peninsula,'' the agency said.
   North Korea has demanded cancellation of the Team Spirit exercise
this month, saying it makes progress in a Korean dialogue
impossible. U.S. and South Korean officials say the annual military
exercise _ in which about 200,000 U.S. and South Korean troops are
involved _ is purely defensive.
   North Korea suspended talks between legislators of both countries
in protest of the military exercise. Other talks aimed at arranging
the first meeting between both sides' prime ministers also have
bogged down because of Team Spirit, but another session is set for
April 12.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today praised the naming of
Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater to the Howard
University board of trustees as students continued to occupy the
administration building in protest.
   The students said they would stay until Atwater, who was Bush's
campaign manager, is removed from the board. Classes were suspended
today due to snow and freezing rain.
   Bush was asked if the students at the largely black campus, who
question Atwater's commitment to black concerns, had a legitimate
complaint.
   ``No. I think it's a good thing he's on the board ... I think
that'll work out just fine,'' Bush said at a news conference.
   No arrests have been made in the latest round of a protest that
began late last week. On Friday, students disrupted the university's
annual charter day convocation and prevented entertainer Bill Cosby
from giving the main address.
   From as few as 250 to more than 1,000 students were occupying the
Mordecai Wyatt Johnson Administration building after the takeover
began Monday morning, according to varying reports. Reporters were
not allowed inside.
   Michael Lewis, a junior who is serving as a spokesman for the
protesters, said in a statement that Atwater is ``regarded by
students to be opposed to the black agenda.''
   The university refused to comment last night on the students'
actions or on what steps might be taken.
   A group of students met with Howard University President James E.
Cheek and Board of Trustees Chairman John E. Jacob on Saturday to
discuss a list of demands.
   On Sunday, Atwater met with a group of students in an attempt to
allay their concerns, according to an Atwater spokeswoman. She said
he was unavailable for interviews, but he remained committed to his
seat on the Howard board.
   Although some professors and students have praised the
appointment as an intelligent move, others have attacked it as poor
symbolism.
   Some of Atwater's critics point to his use of the furlough of
convicted criminal Willie Horton to criticize the judgment of
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
nominee, during George Bush's campaign last year.
   ``He masterminded use of the Willie Horton issue to contribute to
the rising anti-black sentiment of the American people,'' Lewis
said, during an earlier interview. ``And we feel that facilitated
the election of former (Ku Klux) Klansman David Duke to the
Louisiana state Legislature.''
   Aside from the removal of Atwater, students are demanding a more
``Afro-centric'' curriculum, a better financial aid processing
system and improved campus security.

   The Soviet media gave Raisa Gorbachev some rare
coverage Tuesday, carrying a report on the Kremlin first lady's
comments on her husband's reforms and how the world's women have
improved prospects for peace.
   ``If people currently are more confident of a peaceful future, we
know that much of the credit goes to women actively working on all
continents for friendship, cooperation and profound mutual
understanding of nations,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said at a reception she
gave Monday in honor of International Women's Day, a Soviet holiday
that will be celebrated Wednesday.
   Her remarks were reported by Tass, the official Soviet news
agency.
   Although Mrs. Gorbachev is shown frequently on Soviet state-run
television and has been interviewed by Western reporters, her views
are rarely reported in Soviet media or heard by her fellow citizens.
   It was unusual for Tass to cover her reception for wives of
ambassadors and other diplomats in Moscow, wives of members of the
ruling Communist Party Politburo and Soviet women in various fields.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, who captures world attention on frequent trips
abroad with her husband, arouses contrary passions in Soviets.
   Some are curious about the dashing, 57-year-old woman who has
changed the role of the Soviet leader's wife into something more
resembling that of the wives of U.S. presidents.
   Until Mikhail S. Gorbachev to power four years ago, the spouses
of Kremlin figures kept a low, often invisible profile, with the
exception of Russian revolutionary Nadezhda Krupskaya, the wife of
Vladimir I. Lenin, who was a member of the party's policy-making
Central Committee.
   Many Soviets look askance at Mrs. Gorbachev, whose wardrobe is
large and glamorous by Soviet standards. Others grumble that the
former teacher of Marxist-Leninist philosophy is too involved in her
husband's work.
   Mrs. Gorbachev's recepition gave her an opportunity to share her
opinions on both domestic and international affairs.
   ``Soviet people are putting into practice plans of revolutionary
restructuring. We are connecting to it the destiny of our country,
of our nation,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said in a reference to her husband's
reforms. ``We want our public life in all aspects _ socio-economic,
political, moral, ecological, and in the sphere of human rights and
freedoms _ to be worthy of a human being.
   ``By transforming and renewing our society on a socialist basis,
on the principles of humanism and democracy, we are making our
country more open for all the nations of the world,'' she said.
   Mrs. Gorbachev greeted her guests individually and gave each of
them a bouquet, said Rebecca Matlock, the wife of U.S. ambassador
Jack Matlock.
   ``She's a very attractive, intelligent and vocal woman. If they
let her speak more often, everyone would benefit,'' Mrs. Matlock
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``I hope with the example of Nancy Reagan coming here and the
television coverage she received here will make it acceptible for
the spouses of leaders to think their own thoughts and express
them,'' Mrs. Matlock said.
   Mrs. Matlock, who was referring to Mrs. Reagan's visit during the
Moscow summit meeting last summer, was one of several hundred guests
at the reception.
   The Gorbachevs later attended a celebration held in Moscow's
Bolshoi Theater to mark International Women's Day. The ceremonies,
broadcast on TV, showed Mrs. Gorbachev returning to the more
traditional protocol role of the Soviet leader's wife.
   Gorbachev sat on the dais with other Politburo members and
dignitaries, while his wife was in the audience.
   In a dispatch showing the limited political clout of women in
Soviet society, Tass also reported Tuesday that of 2,901 candidates
running to represent territorial districts in a new national
assembly, only 17 percent are women.
   Voters nationwide on March 26 will choose 1,500 deputies for the
Council of People's Deputies, a new body that will elect the Soviet
president and parliament. Organizations such as the Communist Party
and trade unions are directly electing deputies to fill 750 other
seats.

<HEAD>Bush Says Pentagon People Will Keep Eye on Tower</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 9 grafs new with further detail on Nunn provbe; picks up
at pvs 6th graf, Meanwhile today, and edits below to tighten</HEAD>

   President Bush said today that 25,000 Pentagon
employees will provide a ``fail-safe guarantee'' that John Tower
abides by his vow to abstain from drinking if he is confirmed as
secretary of defense.
   As Bush underlined his support for his nominee, Senate
Republicans accused Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., of improperly reopening
the investigation into the former Texas senator's personal fitness
to serve.
   Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he
had dispatched investigators from the Senate Governmental Affairs
investigations subcommittee that he also heads to Dallas to probe
new allegations against Tower. He said he did so because he
understood the FBI had ended its own work on the case and was ``out
of business.''
   As the Senate opened its fourth day of debate on the nomination,
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he found it ``very
troubling'' that Nunn had acted on his own to reopen the Tower
investigation using Senate employees.
   ``Why are we investigating Senator Tower?'' Dole asked. ``Isn't
the FBI record adequate? When does this investigation stop?
   Nunn later told Dole that there were ``three or four new
allegations'' and said he had advised Republicans on the
investigations panel before acting.
   He said he had been told the FBI was no longer on the case so
forwarding the allegations to the bureau would have been ``an
exercise in futility.''
   ``There was no other way to check them,'' Nunn said, adding that
iot would satisfy him if the FBI took over.
   Republicans, including Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said they found
Nunn's action ``questionable'' and ``inappropriate.''
   Meanwhile today, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said that
while some other Democrats may follow the lead of Sen. Howell
Heflin, D-Ala., and announce support for Tower, there are not enough
votes to confirm the nominee.
   Mitchell said also that while some Republicans are talking of
prolonging the debate through Easter, he wants a vote soon,
``certainly this week.''
   Commenting in the aftermath of Heflin's decision to support
Tower, Mitchell, D-Maine, said it is entirely possible some other
Democrats may follow the senator's lead.
   ``I feel that when the vote is taken the nomination will be
rejected,'' Mitchell said. ``I do not believe there are sufficient
votes to result in the confirmation of Senator Tower.''
   Bush, commenting at an impromptu news conference at the White
House this morning, said: ``John Tower has said he'll never touch
another drop of liquor and he'll have 25,000 people at the Pentagon
making sure he keeps his word. I would say we have a fail-safe
guarantee.''
   Heflin's decision on Monday heartened Tower's Republican leaders,
who said they may yet ask the Senate to let the nominee defend his
battered reputation from the floor of the chamber itself.
   Mitchell told reporters today he is prepared to comment on that
possibility but will do so only if the request is actually made.
   Some senators who are not part of the GOP leadership have said
the debate may be extended through Easter. Mitchell said he will
oppose such a lengthy delay.
   ``It is my hope it can be concluded soon and certainly this
week,'' he said.
   Heflin said Monday that the FBI had not built a persuasive case
against Tower. He said he is convinced the nominee would not break
his pledge never to drink again if confirmed as the nation's defense
chief. He said Tower is qualified for the job by reason of
background and expertise in military affairs.
   But the encouragement GOP leaders drew from Heflin's announcement
was dampened when another Southern Democrat _ Sen. David Pryor of
Arkansas _ said he would vote ``no.''
   ``I feel this man is going to create rather than solve
problems,'' Pryor said.
   Pryor cited the former Texas senator's lucrative consulting ties
with leading defense contractors after leaving government service as
a U.S. arms negotiator and as chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   Heflin and Pryor announced their decisions shortly after
President Bush called on Democrats to ``put aside partisanship'' and
support the nominee, basing their decisions on their personal
knowledge of Tower's 24-year Senate career rather than ``rumor and
innuendo.''
   Heflin is a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and
chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee. Republicans said that if
someone of Heflin's background is unconvinced by allegations against
Tower in the massive FBI report, other Democrats might be persuaded
to follow his lead.
   The most recent Associated Press survey found 47 Democrats and
one Republican _ Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D. _ either solidly
opposed or leaning against confirmation. Forty Republicans and one
Democrat were either leaning for or supporting confirmation.
   ``We have a better chance, but it's still an uphill fight,'' said
Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, after Heflin's announcement. ``We're
looking for more good men.''
   Republican leaders met with White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu and said later that the possibility of asking the Senate to
permit Tower to come to the Senate floor to answer questions remains
an option.
   Such a dramatic appearance _ if approved _ would be unique in the
Senate's 200 years of experience in judging candidates for Cabinet
positions.
   It would give Tower the chance to rebut allegations that he has
drinking problems, has indulged in indiscreet behavior toward women
and has opened the appearance of possible conflict of interest in
his relations with the defense industry.
   In making his announcement, Heflin said the president and the
American people would see to it Tower kept his word not to drink if
confirmed as secretary of defense.
   ``John Tower _ if confirmed _ will live in a glass bowl,'' Heflin
said ``No one will be more closely watched. ... His most persistent
watchdog will be the American people.
   ``I'm willing to rely on his pledge and give him a chance to
prove himself,'' Heflin said. ``Giving one a chance to redeem
himself or herself is one of the great redeeming factors of the
American way of life.''
   In addition to Heflin, the Bush administration has courted Sen.
Bennett Johnston, D-La., who has labeled the FBI report on Tower as
``unreliable.''
   Johnston says he has not made a decision even though he believes
``there needs to be more fairness put into this process.''
   Republicans said they are also looking at a short list of other
possible Democratic converts, including Sens. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.;
Charles Robb, D-Va.; Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas; and Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I.

   Q. Mr. President, back to Helen's question, the sort of sense
that's developing that, let's say, the John Tower fight is sapping
you _ your ability to get on with other issues. How long are you
willing to fight this fight, let the debate go on? Are you ready to
now call for them to have a vote, say today or tomorrow, just to get
this behind you one way _
   A. No.
   Q. _ or the other?
   A. No. Because, Lesley, in the first place, there's two major
principles: Fair play, and secondly, the right of the president to
have _ historical right _ to have who he wants in his administration.
   And I've heard a lot of judgments on Tower based on reports
during _ people reading the same report and coming out with
different judgment.
   I want him.
   I believe he is the best man for the job.
   There are a lot of historical precedents behind my desire to have
him and, you might say, right to have him, barring any very clear
reason not to.
   And therefore, I will stay with it.
   And secondly, it's the Senate that controls when they vote or
not, and I will leave that to Bob Dole and to George Mitchell, both
of whom I think are conducting themselves very well.
   Q. May I ask you _
   A. This is a follow-up, yeah?
   Q. _ a question about the chain of command question, because the
senator admits to excessive drinking, which would disqualify him for
a job in the so-called chain of command. Does this not disturb you
at all, that that's the qualification for a job _
   A. No, I think he'll measure up to that qualification.
   Indeed, he has said he'd never touch another drop of liquor and
you'll have 25,000 people in the Pentagon making sure that's true.
   So what _ I mean, here's a, I'd say, a fail-safe guarantee.
   It doesn't bother me.
   And I _
   Q. (Inaudible.)
   A. No. I think he _ I think when you look at the record and look
at the testimony, as I have _ and I haven't had one single senator _
not one _ served with him over the years, say, ``I have seen him. My
first-hand evidence is this man is ineligible because of his
consumption of spirits.''
   Not one.
   And isn't that a little bit unusual?
   So I go right back to the president's right to have his choice.
   Let's keep it on a non-partisan basis.
   I would just reurge that both Senator Nunn and George Mitchell
have told me, ``Wait a minute. This isn't a partisan fight.''
   And I would simply ask that they keep reiterating that to those
senators who may not have made up their minds with finality, and
let's go to a vote.
   But I'm not going to pull back on this.
   And Lesley, it isn't iron-willed stubbornness.
   It's a question of fundamental principle here.
   And I've spelled out my call for fair play, and I'm going to keep
reiterating it.
   So let the Senate work its will.
   It's not going to hurt.
   And this concept that you can never work in the future because
people disagree with you in the Senate, I simply don't accept that.
   Q. Mr. President, you have said that the FBI report guns down the
accusations against Senator Tower, and yet you have also said that
there can be no release, in practical terms, because of the
confidentiality of people interviewed. Have you given consideration,
given the problem with the nomination, to asking those interviewed
to waive the right of confidentiality so that the public doesn't
have to take your word for it as to the degree to which this report
exonerates the senator?

   A confessed North Korean agent said in
court Tuesday she planted the bomb that blew a South Korean jetliner
apart over the Andaman Sea in 1987, killing all 115 people aboard.
   Relatives of victims shouted insults as security agents led Kim
Hyun-hui into the courtroom for the opening session of her trial.
One relative screamed ``I'm here to kill you!'' and another: ``Bring
back my husband!''
   The 27-year-old defendant buried her face in her hands and sobbed.
   Ms. Kim told the court later she bombed the Korean Air Boeing 707
on orders from leaders of communist North Korea who wanted to
disrupt the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. The bomb exploded as the plane
approached the Burma coast Nov. 29, 1987, on a flight to Seoul from
Baghdad, capital of Iraq.
   Her admission came in response to questions by prosecutors. After
the prosecution finished presenting its evidence, the court
adjourned until March 21, when defense lawyers will present their
case.
   Ahn Kang-min, the senior prosecutor, asked whether the order to
bomb the plane came from Kim Jung Il, son and heir-apparent to North
Korean leader Kim Il Sung. Ms. Kim replied ``Yes'' in a barely
audible voice.
   Recounting the defendant's earlier confession to being a North
Korean agent, the prosecutor said Kim Jung Il's order was issued
through a senior Communist Party official. He said it the bombing
was intended to frighten foreign countries away from the Seoul
Olympics.
   Although Ms. Kim had confessed to the bombing in a national news
conference a year ago, her trial was delayed as part of South
Korea's effort to avoid trouble with North Korea before the games.
The North Koreans have denied involvement in the bombing.
   Mass murder and destruction of an aircraft are among six counts
against the defendant and she could be sentenced to death if
convicted, but indications are that her life would be spared.
   Government officials have said she probably would be pardoned and
used for propaganda against North Korea.
   One said privately: ``She deserves capital punishment, but
keeping her alive is more useful. She is a valuable evidence showing
North Korea's atrocity.''
   He said other North Korean agents captured by South Korea,
including one who attacked the presidential mansion in 1968, had
been pardoned for that purpose.
   About 1,500 police were deployed Tuesday at the Seoul District
Criminal Court to hold back angry relatives and guard against a
possible North Korean attempt to assassinate Ms. Kim. Everyone
entering the court walked through a metal detector and was
physically searched.
   Crying and wailing relatives allowed into the courtroom
interrupted the hearing repeatedly and about 20 security agents
surrounded Ms. Kim. Two women lunged at her during the afternoon
session and guards took them away.
   Some relatives shouted claims that she was a South Korean agent
being used by the government to discredit the North.
   Prosecutors opened the trial by reviewing the defendant's life
and asking questions about her training as a North Korean
intelligence agent. She slumped forward in her chair and replied
``Yes'' to the questions.
   Ms. Kim said she and another agent, traveling on forged
passports, planted a bomb disguised as a radio and liquor when they
flew on the plane from Baghdad to Abu Dhabi.
   She and her companion, an elderly man, were arrested in Bahrain
three days later and tried to kill themselves with cyanide hidden in
cigarettes. He died but Ms. Kim recovered and was extradited.
   At the televised news conference in January 1988, she said she
was a North Korean agent and had planted a bomb on the plane.
   North Korea demanded to be a co-host of the Olympics, which it
saw as a political victory for South Korea, and boycotted them when
the demand was refused.
   The Korean Peninsula has been divided since 1945 and the two
sides fought a war in 1950-53.

   A. Or the word of the opponents. Yes, we have thought about that,
and I'm not sure where our counsel's office stands on it.
   But I'll tell you that the precedent is troubling, when you take
testimony and then _ and then certainly you can't go ahead and
release.
   I mean, I just could not do that.
   And I think it's very damaging in the future.
   So, I'm saying I have read it, this is my view, and it is _ it's
inhibiting because it does confine the debate on the floor.
   But I really worry about the precedent.
   So, I have not been pushing for sanitization and then release, or
for selective release, or for _ I hadn't thought about this concept
of going to somebody and say, ``Would you release us from
confidentiality?''
   I think that would chill future proceedings.
   Let's go back in the back. Right in the middle back there.
   Q. Mr. President, you mentioned yesterday in the speech to the
VFW that this 90-day deadline that you had imposed on yourself for
the strategic review might slip because you said that the results
wouldn't be rushed. Is there going to be a new deadline? And is the
fact that you don't have a sitting defense secretary contributing to
that?
   A. I hope there's not going to be any slippage.
   I want that, I want the budget review, I want the management
review completed by then.
   And look, not having a defense secretary in place, no question
that it's an inhibiting factor.
   But I went over to the bureau the other day in a _ I mean the
Defense Department _ in a trip that was interpreted for one purpose.
   And what I went over, really, for was a more _ was another
purpose.
   And the purpose I went over there for was _ please understand,
we've got to keep these reviews going forward.
   And I am very grateful to those people, some of whom won't be
there in a new administration, all of whom _ or most of whom _ have
served in the past administration, for seriously addressing
themselves to these various reviews.
   I hope we can make the target.
   The minute that's made _ the target is made _ and the review
comes, then we have a lot of decision-making.
   But I want to _ I don't want to be footdragging, and, therefore,
I'm going to try to keep the heat on without slippage there.
   Yes?
   Q. The head of Eastern Airlines, Frank Lorenzo, is from Houston,
Texas. Is he a friend of yours? Did he give money to your campaign?
And one of his vice presidents is on your staff as head of
congressional relations. Is he giving you advice?
   A. He has recused himself, as I understand it, from the Eastern
Airlines, and he is not giving me advice.
   I know Frank Lorenzo, and in all probability, he gave money to
the Bush-Quayle campaign.
   Q. Does _
   A. Now _ a follow-up?
   Q. Does that influence you in any way?
   A. No, it does not influence me in any way.

   When next winter rolls around, no woman need
worry that she will be left out in the cold.
   Italian designers showing their fall-winter 1989-90 collections
here this week devote much of their creative talent to coats, from
the pratical polo to dramatic capes and elegant dusters.
   The cut is as generous as it is cozy. Ample sleeves, huge shawl
collars, and loosely pleated backs contribute to create a soft
flowing effect. Most often belted at the waist, these outer
coverings are either cropped at the hip, or so long they can double
as street sweepers.
   The favorite fabric is wool, but leather and shearling also play
heavily in the collections, not to mention fur, from fake to
extravagant mink.
   Colors are warm fall shades ranging from forest greens, to
vineyard reds and purples, to beiges and browns.
   The unpractical but dramatically stylish cape, often hooded like
a medieval friar's, also makes a comeback.
   Ferragamo and Genny, who showed Tuesday, midway through the
fashion week, count heavily on the coat for winter warmth.
   Ferragamo _ the Florentine family known for its town and country
chic and its shoes _ presented a chocolate colored duster with super
wide sleeves, tied at the waist, and a series of chic car coats with
bright gold buttons.
   On the whole, the Ferragamo collection was very smart and sporty,
with trim pants suits in black and white checkered patterns, and
patchwork leather blazers and knee-length skirts for daytime, and
sophisticated long sleeved silk jersey gowns, buttoned or unbuttoned
at the back with gold buttons for evening.
   Genny, designed by Versace but more subdued than his presentation
of micro miniskirts during his own collection Sunday night,
presented the most opulent coat wear seen thus far on the Milan
runway, in his series of lavish mink wraps.
   These unabashedly expensive creations, made up no doubt of
hundreds of skins to create the huge collar, ample sleeve and wide
swirling hemline, go against the current conservationist trend for
imitation furs in elegant styles, favored among others by Armani
(Emporio) and Moschino.
   The Genny collection was snappy and young with a wide variety of
pants ranging from man-tailored to tight-fitting jodhpurs, and
short-cropped jackets. Skirts were a mere four inches above the
knee, a conservative length for flamboyant Versace, but still had
his trademark tight derriere.
   Evening at Genny's is basically black, enriched by traditional
pearl accessories, or an enticing rhinestone embroidered bustier
peering out of a slinky chiffon gown.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Said Planning to Replace Nelson at Immigration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will replace Alan C.
Nelson as head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, an
administration source said Tuesday.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who recently received a
department audit that criticized management and operations of INS,
is searching for someone to take over the agency, said the source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The source confirmed a report in Tuesday's editions of the Los
Angeles Times that Nelson would be not be kept as INS commissioner
in the Bush administration.
   It has been long presumed by department watchers that Nelson,
along with most other political officeholders in the Justice
Department, would be replaced.
   Nelson, a San Francisco lawyer close to former Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, became INS commissioner in 1982.
   He was criticized by immigrant rights advocates for being slow to
implement the provisions of the 1986 immigration reform law, which
provided for massive amnesty for illegal aliens.
   INS became embroiled in a number of lawsuits charging that it was
improperly making it difficult for illegal aliens to obtain legal
status under the new law.
   The Justice Department audit, completed two weeks ago, cited INS
for its failure to conduct background checks on many applicants for
citizenship and found that 23,000 valuable naturalization
certificates had been lost by the agency's Miami regional office.
   The special audit, conducted at Thornburgh's request by the
Justice Department's management division, raised ``serious questions
which are being reviewed now at the highest levels of the
department,'' spokesman David Runkel said last week.
   Besides losing naturalization certifications, which had a street
value of up to $115 million, INS was cited in the audit for failing
to take action two years after investigators had discovered that
61,500 naturalized citizens had not surrendered their permanent
resident alien cards.

   President Bush today urged pilots threatening a
sympathy slowdown in support of the Eastern Airlines strike not to
``make the innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute,'' and
stood by his opposition to government intervention to stop the
walkout.
   He said that if striking machinists try to shut down rail service
he will ask Congress to ban such secondary boycotts.
   House Speaker Jim Wright responded that Bush's refusal to halt
the strike by appointing an investigative panel ``would be
unprecedented,'' noting that over the past half-century 33 such
boards have been named in transportation disputes.
   Bush said once again that he is determined to press his
nomination of John G. Tower to be secretary of defense to a showdown
vote in the Senate because ``I want him and I believe he is the best
man for the job.''
   Bush reminded a White House press conference that Tower has
pledged not to touch a drop of liquor if he gets the defense job,
and ``you'll have 25,000 people in the Pentagon making sure that's
true.''
   The president said that his backing of Tower against Democratic
opposition in the Senate ``isn't iron-willed stubbornness, it's a
question of fundamental principle here.''
   Bush quickly added the news conference to his schedule this
morning after an ice and snow storm forced cancellation of a
presidential trip to Lancaster, Pa., and Wilmington, Del.
   The president gave a preliminary welcome to the Soviet proposal,
made Monday at an East-West conference in Vienna, for a reduction in
conventional weapons and military personnel in Europe. The proposal
was outlined by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   ``It looks to me he is moving toward the oft-stated public
position of NATO in this regard, and that is good,'' Bush said, but
cautioned he had not yet seen Secretary of State James A. Baker
III's cabled report on the conference of foreign ministers from NATO
countries and Warsaw Pact nations.
   Bush was asked if he would pursue ``linkage'' in his relations
with the Soviet Union.
   He said issues are related, and if the Soviets cooperate with the
United States in one area, it will respond in another area. ``So
there is linkage,'' he said.
   For example, the president said he would welcome any reduction in
Soviet military aid to pro-communist forces in Central America or an
increase in the number of Soviet Jews permitted to emigrate to the
West, he will welcome that.
   ``When something good happens, give them credit,'' Bush said.
``There clearly has got to be some linkage.''
   Bush said the Tower debate has not immobilized his
administration, as some critics are saying, countering simply that
they are wrong.
   He said the administration is not adrift, ``we're on track.''
   ``I will not be stampeded by some talk that we have not come up
with bold, new foreign policy proposals in 45 days,'' Bush said.
   The president also defended his chief of staff, saying John
Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor, knows his way around
Washington and is doing his job well. Bush said he has total
confidence in Sununu.
   On other issues, he said:
   _There is not much question that the Contra rebels in Nicaragua
will need additional humanitarian aid. ``We simply cannot and I will
not leave the Contras out there with no humanitarian aid at all,''
he said.
   _He is willing to be flexible on action to limit sales of
automatic and semi-automatic weapons, but the issue is a complicated
one. ``It isn't as easy as it seems for those who are understandably
crying out to do something,,' he said.
   _He did raise the issue of human rights in China during his visit
to Beijing, but did so privately. Bush was criticized because the
topic was not on his announced agenda. But he said it was better
handled quietly and ``I confidently expect Jim Baker will continue
to raise it.''

   The state Supreme Court has suspended a
lawyer for a year for pocketing Girl Scout cookie proceeds belonging
to her daughter's troop.
   Marlene T. Sipes of Columbia, a lobbyist with the South Carolina
Medical Association, has repaid the $1,819 she kept in 1986 for
personal and family business. The court issued a reprimand and
announced the suspension Monday.
   The court said Mrs. Sipes' conduct constituted ``a breach of
trust accompanied by fraud'' and involved ``dishonesty, deceit and
misrepresentation.''
   Mrs. Sipes, a graduate of the University of South Carolina Law
School, worked three years as a law clerk and paralegal for the
state Department of Consumer Affairs before going to work for the
medical association last year.
   She did not return messages left at her office Tuesday.

<HEAD>Kitty Dukakis Returns Home From Treatment Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' wife waved at reporters
and held her husband tightly when she arrived home today after
spending a month in an alcohol treatment program.
   Emerging from a car driven by her father, Harry Ellis Dickson,
Kitty Dukakis smiled broadly. ``Doesn't she look terrific,'' said
the governor, his arm around her.
   Asked what was the best part of returning home, Mrs. Dukakis
said, ``Being with my husband.'' Without missing a beat, her husband
added, ``Being with my wife.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, had been in Edgehill Newport, an intensive
residential facility in Rhode Island, since Feb. 5. She entered the
facility after several bouts of excessive drinking at home following
her husband's failed presidential bid.
   Following the family's wishes, the governor's staff was publicly
silent about Mrs. Dukakis' condition and her treatment. The
governor's press office has been bombarded with inquiries and
interview requests, but no plans have been made for Mrs. Dukakis to
discuss her experience.
   Mrs. Dukakis was driven home by the governor and by her father.
On the way home, she visited with her 5-week-old granddaughter.
   ``Kitty and I will never be able to thank personally the
thousands of people in Massachusetts and from throughout the country
who have written or called with kind words of encouragement and love
and support for her during her treatment,'' Dukakis said.
   A statement by his office said Mrs. Dukakis expects ``soon to
resume a full and active schedule'' but provided no details.
   One senior Dukakis administration official said he had no reason
to believe the treatment was not a success.
   ``Every indication from the governor's attitude and what he has
had to say is that it has been successful and that Kitty is going to
resume an active, independently fulfilling schedule, following up
all the plans she had been making before,'' said the source who
refused to be identified.
   ``Our feeling is it is a private matter,'' James Dorsey, the
governor's press secretary, said. But he added, ``There may come a
time when the governor and his wife decide to make it not a private
matter.''

   A rush-hour power failure struck
large areas of the capital on Tuesday, causing huge traffic jams,
police said.
   It was not clear what caused the break in Amsterdam's electric
power supply, but it occurred shortly after a nitrogen tank in a
subway station started leaking at 5 p.m., according to a police
spokesman who declined to be identified.
   The nitrogen was used as a coolant in an electrical switching
box, the spokesman said.
   The outage affected about half of this city of 650,000, according
to a radio report.
   The city's main thoroughfares became clogged when hundreds of
traffic lights failed, and cable television sytems went out.
   Less than an hour after the failure, several areas were on line
again, the police spokesman said.

   Q. Mr. President, this is supposed to be _ the theme of the week
is drugs this week, and you mentioned again this morning your
commitment to ridding the country of drugs. But your designate for
drug czar, William Bennett, has said that, as part of what _ the way
that he would like to help end drug violence would be to consider a
ban on semiautomatic weapons, which is opposed to your own
viewpoint. And we're getting more and more evidence from doctors and
police that there's gunfire in the streets and wounds that they
haven't seen since the Vietnam War, because of these weapons. What
do you say to people whose families have _ family members have been
maimed by these kinds of weapons?
   A. I say the same thing I say to a person whose family has maimed
by a pistol or a explosive charge or whatever else it might be _ a
fire _ this is bad, and we have got to stop the scourge of drugs.
   And I talked to Bill Bennett about that, because I said, ``Bill,
what can be worked out with finality on AK-47s? What can be done and
still, you know, do what's right by the legitimate sportsman?''
   I'd love to find an answer to that, Rita, because I do think that
there has to be some assurance that these automated attack weapons
are not used in the manner they're being used.
   So I'd like to _ and I told Bill. I said, ``Look, I _ don't worry
about what you said up there.'' I said, ``I can identify with what
was behind your thinking on that very, very easily.''
   I'd like to find some accommodation.
   The problem, as you know, is that automated AK-47s are banned,
and semiautomated are not.
   So in they come; and then they get turned over to automated
weapons by _ through some filing down.
   It isn't as easy as it seems to those who are understandably
crying out, ``Do something. Do something.''
   But I've tasked Bill; I've said, ``Bill, work the problem. Find
out. And I'm not so rigid that I can't, if you come to me with a
sensible answer that takes care of the concerns I've felt over the
years, I'll take a hard look at it and I'll work with you to that
end.''
   Dave?
   Q. Mr. President, do you support the Republican Congressional
Committee's decision to make Jim Wright its No. 1 target next year?
And doesn't that conflict with your _
   A. Hey, listen, I've got enough fights on my hands now, Dave.
   I _ (laughter) _ I'm not looking for any more.
   Let the Congress do its thing, and I'll just stay right where I
am plugging away on a matter of principle for a battle that's going
on in the _ I'll let you know if I want to take on any more.
   Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, on foreign policy, there's some confusion over
how you feel about linkage, about linking Soviet good behavior,
particularly in Central America, to granting them technological
transfers and economic credits. If Gorbachev helps you in Central
America, specifically Nicaragua, are you willing to help him
economically?

<HEAD>Baker Doesn't See PLO Raids as Terrorism; Bush Wants Arafat to Speak
Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SHANNON, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has
concluded that attacks by PLO guerrillas against Israelis in
southern Lebanon were not acts of terrorism requiring a break-off of
U.S. talks with Yasser Arafat's organization.
   A senior State Department official, aboard Baker's plane on the
way home from Vienna, said Tuesday concerning what should be labeled
terrorism, ``We make a mistake if we define that too closely.''
   In Washington, President Bush was asked at his news conference
whether Arafat, in refusing to criticize the raids, was backing down
on his condemnation of terrorism.
   ``I hope not, and I'd like to see him forthrightly condemn any
terror that might be perpetrated by the Palestinians,'' Bush
answered. ``I stop short of saying he's condoning it or that he is
furthering it; I'm not saying that. But I'd like to see him speak
out. It would do wonders, it would be very good for a future
dialogue.''
   When the questioner asked if Arafat was jeopardizing the current
dialogue, Bush replied, ``To the degree terroristic acts are
condoned, it doesn't help the dialogue.''
   Arafat's renunciation of terrorism and recognition of Israel's
right to exist prompted the United States last December to open
talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Since then PLO guerrillas have conducted at least three raids
against Israeli forces _ raids the Israeli government contends were
aimed at infiltrating Israel itself.
   Senior U.S. officials, including then-Assistant Secretary of
State Richard W. Murphy, had said at the onset of the dialogue that
it would be suspended if terrorism recurred.
   Baker subsequently warned the PLO the attacks could hurt the
talks and U.S. efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. Last
Friday the State Department questioned Arafat's commitment and
whether he wanted to control PLO factions that carried out the raids.
   ``If the PLO leadership cannot or will not exercise such control,
it raises questions regarding the commitments undertaken in the name
of the PLO, indeed questions about the PLO's ability to carry out
their commitment,'' spokesman Charles E. Redman said.
   The strong statement appeared to suggest the Bush administration
was reconsidering the dialogue.
   But as Baker flew home from Vienna, where he had met with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, that impression dissolved.
   Baker's view ``is that the dialogue should continue,'' the
official said. ``It is important.''
   For Baker , he said, ``the real test is terrorism.'' We make a
mistake if we define that too closely.''
   The official recalled the late Supreme Court Justice Potter
Stewart's observation that he could not define pornography but would
know it when he saw it. Baker's view on terrorism was described to
reporters as similar to Stewart's on pornography.
   For instance, the official said, Baker considers the attack on
the U.S. Marine headquarters near Beirut in October 1983, in which
241 Marines and sailors were killed, as an act of terrorism.

   A. Look, the more cooperation we can get on regional objectives,
our regional objectives _ in this instance, the democratization of
Central America _ the more help we can get towards that end by the
Soviets with pulling back their large amount of military support,
the better it would be between relations.
   So, there is linkage.
   But when it gets to the specifics of what I'll be willing to do,
that'll come out under this whole policy review.
   But we are not going to back away from agenda items, including
regional tensions.
   And when something good happens, give some credit.
   When the Soviets come out of Afghanistan, which happened here not
so long ago, give them credit for that.
   When you get lightening up a little bit on the question of Soviet
Jews or something of that nature, give some credit.
   So, there is _ I don't know exactly how to help you in terms of
how much linkage there is, but there's clearly got to be some
linkage.
   Q. Sir, have you been getting the cables back from Vienna from
Secretary of State Baker? He's been meeting with Foreign Minister
Shevardnadze. Is Shevardnadze saying anything encouraging along this
line?
   A. Well, I haven't gotten _ I hadn't seen the overnight cable
from Baker reporting on that meeting so I can't comment.
   I read some reports of what Shevardnadze said in terms of
conventional forces, and it looks to me like he's moving towards the
oft-stated public position of NATO in this regard, and that is good
_ where it's not a question of numbers you take out, it's a question
of numbers that are left when you finish taking troops out.
   So, I think there's been some encouraging _ but I have not yet
seen the Baker report, and I haven't talked to him since his visit.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, non-military aid to the Contras will run out at
the end of the month. Do you plan to propose new aid to the Contras
and some package of carrots and sticks for the Sandinistas?
   A. Well, I hope there are some _ I hope there is some
understanding on the hill that these people must not be left without
humanitarian aid.
   And we have already, through the secretary of state before he
left, pointed out that that was my inclination, was to strongly
support the appeal for humanitarian aid.
   We simply cannot, and I will not, leave the Contras out there
with no humanitarian aid at all _ ability to stay alive at this
juncture.
   Q. But will you _ would a package include some promise of renewed
military aid, depending on the Sandinistas' behavior at this point?
   A. We are talking, as I think the secretary said the other day,
about how best to move the process of democratization forward.
   Had a very interesting talk with Mr. Cerezo on that.
   And I'm hopeful that before the 90-day period is up, you know, on
the presidents coming out, that we can get some very clear
statements.

   Engineers Tuesday replaced a failed
electronic part on Discovery with one borrowed from sister ship
Columbia, and NASA said it hopes to launch the space shuttle and its
five astronauts on Monday.
   ``We're still pressing ahead toward a Monday launch at 8:07
a.m.,'' said space agency spokesman Dick Young. But he said a firm
date might not be set until Wednesday, after the replacement part
had been thoroughly checked out.
   The launch, which will deploy a $100 million communications
satellite, had been set for Saturday after three earlier
postponements. But it received another setback on Monday with the
failure of a system that commands separation of the two booster
rockets and the external fuel tank from the shuttle in flight.
   Engineers replaced the unit with one from space shuttle Columbia
and began the testing of it on the launch pad Tuesday.
   The unit detonates explosives in flight to separate such things
as the spacecraft from the launch pad and the booster rockets and
fuel tank from the ship.
   NASA has said if Discovery is not launched by March 18, it might
have to yield the pad to space shuttle Atlantis, which is set for
liftoff April 28 on a high-priority mission in which it will propel
the Magellan probe toward Venus.
   Magellan must be launched between that date and May 23 because
the planet will not be in proper position again until 1991.
   Discovery is to make the third shuttle flight since the
Challenger explosion killed seven astronauts more than three years
ago.
   During five days in orbit, the astronauts are scheduled to deploy
a communciations satelllite and conduct medical and scientific
experiments.

<BYLINE>Will It Play in Lubbock? ^By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lubbock may be George Bush's Peoria.
   He cited a fan from the Texas city on Tuesday in defending the
beginning of his administration, which some critics contend is
getting off to a slow start.
   Bush told a White House news conference that he had ``talked to a
fellow from Lubbock, Texas, the other day. ... And he said: `All the
people in Lubbock think things are going just great.'''
   The reference to populatiry in a smaller city in the nation's
midsection evoked memories of the phrase ``Will it play in Peoria?''
which became popular in the Nixon administration.
   If Lubbock is to replace Peoria as the standard for middle
American acceptance, let's see how the two compare, based on
statistics reported in the Census Bureau's ``County and City Data
Book: 1988.''
   Lubbock is physically bigger, with 106.3 square miles of land
compared to just 42.2 square miles in Peoria. Lubbock has more
people too, outnumbering its Illinois companion 186,400 to 110,290.
   But Peoria is a bit more crowded, at 2,614 people per square mile
compared to 1,754 in Lubbock.
   The two cities are diverging in size.
   From 1980 to 1986, the Sun Belt city of Lubbock saw its
population grow 7.2 percent. Over the same time, Peoria lost 11.2
percent of its residents.
   In racial breakdown, the cities are somewhat similar. Peoria has
a population that is 81 percent white and 17 percent black, while
Lubbock is 81 percent white and nearly 19 percent black. Peoria has
about 1 percent Asians to help make up the discrepancy.
   On the other hand, 19 percent of Lubbock's residents are
Hispanic, while this group makes up only 1.4 percent of the people
in Peoria. Hispanics can be of any race.
   Peoria is older, with 12.3 percent of its people aged 65 and
over, compared to 7.8 percent in Lubbock.
   Lubbock's birth rate is 20.1 births per 1,000 people, compared to
16.5 for Peoria, while the death rate is 9.8 per 1,000 in Peoria and
6.6 for Lubbock.
   Peoria has a narrow lead in high school graduates, 69.6 percent
of its residents compared to 69.3 percent in Lubbock. On the other
hand, Lubbock counts 22.4 percent of its people with four years of
college, compared to 16.5 percent in Peoria.
   Per capita income in Peoria in 1985 was $11,140, compared to
$10,452 for Lubbock, with 12.4 percent of the people in the Illinois
metropolis below the poverty level compared to 14.4 percent in the
Texas city.
   Peoria, in the midwestern farm belt, is twice as wet as the
semiarid high plains city in Texas. Rain averages nearly 35 inches
annually in Peoria but only 17.7 inches in Lubbock.
   Peoria is also colder, with an average January low reading of
13.3 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to a low of 24.3 degrees for
Lubbock.
   But summers are hotter in Texas, with July's high averaging 91.0
degrees for Lubbock and 85.5 degrees for Peoria.

   But in terms of humanitarian aid, I don't think there'll be much
resistance to that at all.
   Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, on another regional question, Yasser Arafat has
refused to criticize any of the raids within Israel that have been
carried out. Is he backing down on his promise against terrorism?
   A. I hope not, and I'd like to see him forthrightly condemn any
terror that might be perpetrated by the Palestinians.
   I stop short of saying he's condoning it or that he is furthering
it; I'm not saying that.
   But I'd like to see him speak out _ it would do wonders.
   It would be very good for a future dialogue.
   Yes, Jim?
   Q. Well, is he jeopardizing the dialogue as it sits now?
   A. To the degree terroristic acts are condoned, it doesn't help
the dialogue.
   Yes?
   Q. There is a school of thought in Washington, Mr. President,
that perception is often reality, or becomes reality. The perception
is that your administration is floundering, that your White House
staff is inept. How do you deal with it? How do you turn it around?
   A. I ask for your forbearance and leadership in this regard,
pointing out all the things that I spelled out in the beginning,
comparing that in terms of appointments.
   I've spared you the statistics on appointments which I had
prepared, because one of the hits is, ``You haven't sent up any
names. You haven't done anything about names.''
   And so, I would refer to my notes, Jerry, if that's all right.
   And I have lost my notes on this _ no, here they are.
   And in terms of the Reagan-Bush administration, at this juncture,
55 names as of March 6th had been announced.
   On the Bush-Quayle administration, 67 have been announced.
   So, it's not bad.
   We're a little bit ahead in terms of announced names.
   Now, you've got some different problems here, because one is
nomination and the other is intent to nominate.
   And intent to nominate means there's still some more paperwork to
be done.
   But in terms of who we want in place, we're moving along all
right.
   I'd like to see it faster, of course, but that's one of the
allegations _ disarray.
   First, I have great confidence in my staff, and every chief of
staff goes through this drill where he gets saluted for his
brilliance, and a month later he gets attacked for his something
else.
   And I have total confidence in John Sununu.
   He knows the way this town works.
   He has a respect level that comes from being a _ and there he is
_ (laughs) _ a respect level that comes from being a governor.
   And so, we're all used to this.
   Hey, this is light compared to what it was like about a year ago
in my case, so that's why I still feel relaxed.

   American workers' productivity rose a barely

labor costs, a major inflation measure for business, shot up at an
annual rate of 5.6 percent, the government reported Tuesday.
   The latest news from the Labor Department confirmed an initial
report by the department a month ago which showed that productivity,
or output per hour of work, turned sluggish in the final three
months of the year while inflationary pressures intensified.
   The 5.6 percent rise in unit labor costs was almost double the
3.7 percent rate of increase in the third quarter. Unit labor costs
reflect changes in hourly compensation as well as changes in
productivity.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last week cited labor
costs as one of the factors behind the central bank's recent
decision to push interest rates higher in an effort to fight
inflation.
   Analysts said that Tuesday's report, which did not revise the
unit labor costs from the initial estimate, would likely add to the
central bank's resolve to keep pushing interest rates higher,
especially if the report on February unemployment, to be released on
Friday, comes in as strong as expected.
   With demand for workers pushing up against tight labor markets
and high factory operating rates, economists are worried that
resulting pressures are starting to be seen in rising wage demands
by workers and product-price increases on the part of businesses.
   ``Almost any reasonable person has to be scared about inflation
right now,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc.
of Lexington, Mass. ``There is clear evidence that compensation
costs are accelerating.''
   The fear is that if wage demands begin chasing rising consumer
prices, the country could be plunged back into a wage-price spiral
similar to the one in the 1970s that then-Federal Reserve Chairman
Paul Volcker fought with the steep 1981-82 recession.
   The 5.6 percent rate of increase for unit labor costs in the
fourth quarter reflected a 5.6 percent rise in hourly compensation,
which includes wages and salaries as well as fringe benefits.
   In the final six months of the year, hourly compensation was
rising at an annual rate of 5.7 percent, a sharp acceleration from
an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first six months of 1988.
   Analysts said most of the increase in the final half of the year
reflected rising health insurance costs.
   For the year as a whole, productivity increased 1.4 percent,
matching the average annual gains since the end of the 1981-82
recession.
   The final quarter's 0.1 percent rise in nonfarm business
productivity reflected a 3.7 percent increase in output which was
nearly offset by a 3.6 percent rise in the number of hours worked.
The weak advance continued a sawtooth pattern in which a strong gain
in one quarter has been followed by a poor showing in the next.
   Productivity rose at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the first
quarter of 1988, dropped at a rate of 2.4 percent in the second
quarter and then rebounded at a 2 percent rate in the July-September
quarter.
   Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said
that the 1.4 percent advance for the year, while up from a 0.8
percent increase in 1987, was still a dismal performance compared to
the rapid gains of 3.3 percent posted in the two decades following
World War II when American workers enjoyed healthy wage gains and a
rising standard of living.
   ``This set of figures reinforces the fact that productivity
growth in this country is still very sluggish,'' he said. ``If
productivity is hardly growing at all, that means that people's
standard of living is not rising either.''
   The Bush administration is counting on productivity rising about
2 percent a year as a key underpinning of its economic forecast
which sees the budget deficit being eliminated by the year 1993.
   However, many private economists believe this forecast is overly
optimistic despite a major push by U.S. industry since the last
recession to modernize production facilities.
   Tuesday's productivity report showed that total U.S.
productivity, including the farm sector, fell at an annual rate of 2
percent in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the continued
effects of last summer's severe drought.

<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, in a congressional
appearance that in itself signaled a change from the Reagan
administration, pledged Tuesday to ``steward HUD into a new era''
and vigorously seek solutions to the nation's housing ills.
   ``I don't think there's been a time when there have been more
people willing to put aside (partisan differences) and try to find
solutions to the vexing problems in our society,'' Kemp said in his
first testimony as secretary of housing and urban development.
   ``We'll leave politics until 1992,'' he said.
   Kemp, who has already toured several public housing projects in
an ambitious schedule, outlined a series of sharp turns away from
the last eight years and said he's ``willing to be audacious'' in
addressing inner city problems.
   He said his priorities include strong enforcement of last year's
fair housing law, the revitalization of what he called the ``Third
World economies'' of inner cities and a hope to end homelessness in
the United States.
   ``I believe that a dream must be recaptured for our urban cities
and for those people, urban and rural, who today live their lives in
poverty and despair,'' said Kemp, a former nine-term congressman
from upstate New York.
   But members of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban
Affairs were as impressed with his appearance as with what Kemp
said. His predecessor, Samuel Pierce, last testified in Congress in
March 1985 as HUD became a battleground over Reagan era spending on
social programs.
   ``Snow, sleet or rain, I think it's very symbolic that I am here
today,'' said Kemp, adding, ``We're all in the process of putting
aside partisan difference to see what works.''
   He pledged to ``implement vigorously'' the law Congress passed
last year strengthening federal regulations against housing
discrimination.
   ``I am going to steward HUD into a new era of fair housing
enforcement,'' Kemp said. ``We will try to end, to the extent
possible, discrimination in housing.''
   Kemp also promised that President Bush will fully fund the
McKinney Act, which Congress passed last year over Reagan
administration objections, to provide housing for the homeless.
   ``This, from a historical standpoint, is something that can no
longer be neglected,'' he said. ``I'm not going to approach this
from some 18th century laissez faire attitude ... I believe our
priority should be to end (homelessness).''
   A booster of enterprise zones, in which businesses would get tax
breaks for locating in certain areas, Kemp said he will push the pet
project but bowed to opponents by saying, ``I don't think of
enterprise zones as a panacea.''
   ``My mind is open,'' he told the committee. ``My door is open. I
want you to know my heart will be open to solutions as well.''
   Although most members of the committee lauded Kemp warmly,
several urged him to seek more money for housing programs and said
they'll judge his commitment by the bottom line in President Bush's
budget.
   ``Hope is no substitute for a positive program,'' said Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif. ``I will hold you to your rhetoric and your claim
to do something about homelessness.''

<HEAD>Fears Mount For Japanese Mountain Climbers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Park Service requested help
from the Army as fears mounted that three Japanese climbers trying
to make a winter ascent of Mount McKinley were near death somewhere
near the summit.
   The Park Service on Tuesday said little can be done until
hurricane-force winds buffeting the 20,320-foot peak abate.
   The climbers have not been heard from in more than a week and are
believed to have run out of food six days ago, said John Quinley, a
park service spokesman. The men have a radio but have made no
contact, he said.
   The Army has Chinook helicopters specially equipped for
high-altitude rescues, but they are not expected to be able to fly
until Thursday or Friday because of the wind, Quinley said.
   An Army plane circled the mountain repeatedly on Monday,
broadcasting messages, but received no response from the climbers,
Quinley said.
   Quinley said park rangers believe the climbers could be holed up
in a snow cave somewhere between 17,000 feet and the summit of Mount
McKinley, North America's highest peak.
   He said there is also concern that the men have run out of fuel
needed to melt snow. Without water, they could quickly succumb to
dehydration and hypothermia.
   McKinley, because of its location near the Arctic Circle, is
judged to be one of the most difficult winter climbs.
   ``Based on what they took, they're six days out of food,''
Quinley said. ``But the park service has a cache at 17,200,
apparently fairly close to where they would be camped, and there's
food and fuel there.''
   The National Weather Service reported sustained winds of 60 mph
to 100 mph in the area. Climbing ranger Bob Seibert of Talkeetna
estimated those winds reach 90 mph to 200 mph as they funnel through
passes in the mountains.
   He identified the missing climbers as 39-year-old Noboru Yamada,
the group leader, 31-year-old Teruo Saegusa and 34-year-old Kozo
Komatsu, all of Tokyo.

   A smiling Kitty Dukakis came home Tuesday from a
month-long stay in an alcohol treatment program, escorted by her
father and her husband.
   With his arm around her waist, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis asked,
``Doesn't she look terrific?''
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, entered the Edgehill Newport treatment center
in Rhode Island on Feb. 5 after developing a drinking problem that
her husband blamed on exhaustion and the letdown following his
failed presidential bid.
   Mrs. Dukakis was driven home by her husband and her father,
conductor Harry Ellis Dickson. On the way, she visited her
5-week-old granddaughter, Alexandra Jane Dukakis.
   Emerging from a car outside her Brookline home, Mrs. Dukakis
smiled broadly and waved to reporters and photographers. Asked what
was the best part of being home, she said, ``Being with my
husband.'' The governor added, ``Being with my wife.''
   The governor and his wife quickly disappeared inside their home.
   ``We and our family are extremely grateful and deeply touched by
the love and support she has received from so many people,'' Dukakis
said in a statement.
   The statement said Mrs. Dukakis expects ``soon to resume a full
and active schedule.'' She recently signed a book contract and
launched a public speaking career.
   Edgehill, a 160-bed facility founded in 1980, operates an
intensive 28-day alcohol program that serves more than 1,000
patients a year.
   Mrs. Dukakis had revealed during her husband's campaign that she
had earlier conquered a 26-year addiction to diet pills.

   A south-to-north ``Freedom Caravan'' will
leave Mississippi in late June to commemorate the 25th anniversary
of the slayings of three civil right workers in Philadelphia,
officials said today.
   The caravan will leave Mississippi on June 20 and arrive in New
York City on June 24 for a memorial ceremony in the city where James
Chaney is buried.
   The bodies of Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were
found in an earthen dam in Neshoba County in 1964, six weeks after
the young men had been reported missing. They had each been shot in
the head.
   Although no one was ever tried for the murders, eight men were
convicted on federal charges of denying the three their
constitutional rights.
   The slayings and the aftermath were the subject of the movie
``Mississippi Burning,'' which received an Academy Award nomination.
   State Rep. Aaron Henry, a black lawmaker and president of the
Mississippi NAACP, said at a news conference that the caravan from
Mississippi to New York would be a symbol of a ``new foundation of
human rights'' in America.
   He said the events will include rallies in Jackson or Meridian
and in Philadelphia. The caravan, including buses and cars, will
proceed through Alabama, Washington and then to New York.
   Gov. Ray Mabus called the commemoration an important event to
symbolize changes in Mississippi and across the South.
   James Farmer, the former director of the Congress for Racial
Equality, said the event will show to people in the northern states
that Mississippi has changed over the past 25 years. He said it will
be a ``prayer pilgrimage of recognition ... of the goodwill that has
come again.''

   Mayor Edward I. Koch says in a new book that his
mother underwent illegal abortions because of Depression-era poverty
and tried to induce a miscarriage while pregnant with his sister.
   In ``His Eminence and Hizzoner,'' written with Cardinal John
O'Connor, Koch describes his transformation from a Greenwich Village
liberal to a man who shares views with many conservatives.
   Koch says that a few years before his mother, Joyce Koch, died in
1961, ``she told me that during her lifetime she'd had a number of
abortions. ... Her reasons were economic.''
   When pregnant with Koch's younger sister, Pat, his mother ``tried
to induce a miscarriage by jumping off chairs and trunks. It didn't
work,'' Koch says. ``When she finally accepted that the child was
going to be born, she worried that she might have injured the fetus.
   ``Personally, I don't think abortion on demand is a good idea,''
Koch writes. Nevertheless, Koch has consistently opposed outlawing
abortion.
   The book, published by William Morrow &amp; Co., goes on sale next

<HEAD>New Orleans Symphony Shakes Off Debt And Serves Up Chopin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Maxim Shostakovich will raise the baton before
a sold-out house Wednesday night in a concert that backers hope
signals the end of years of debt and discord for the New Orleans
Symphony.
   The symphony suspended operation a year ago, unable to pay its
musicians and nearly $4 million in debt.
   It is reopening with the help of volunteers, corporate gifts,
donated services and free rent for five years, its president said
Tuesday.
   ``I'm elated,'' said Ronald W. Jones, who assumed the job of
bailing out the orchestra in December. ``We have put together a
wonderful staff that has been working 24 hours a day doing what
everyone said couldn't be done.''
   The financial crisis had been building for years and was blamed
on mismanagement before the symphony got a full-time manager in
1986. Public and corporate financial support eroded and the money
problems led to a musicians walkout in 1987.
   Jones, president of Louisiana Coca-Cola Bottling, was picked to
head the symphony board and engineer a comeback.
   ``It really got to people in this city when the symphony was
dark. They realized what they were in danger of losing and decided
to make sure it wouldn't happen,'' Jones said.
   Jones also helped the city during last summer's Republican
National Convention. He took over a faltering private fund drive and
helped raise the $5 million needed to pay New Orleans' cost of
serving as host.
   Donations of $225,000, earmarked for the symphony if it reopened,
will pay off the remaining debts and leave the books in the black
Thursday morning, Jones said.
   The symphony's home, the Orpheum Theater, is being completely
restored and has been sold to seven investors, eliminating $2.4
million of the symphony's debts, Jones said. The investors, who have
asked not to be identified, have agreed to let the symphony use the
theater for free for five years.
   ``The work on the theater has been done by volunteers and
contractors who have donated their services for the most part,''
Jones said.
   In addition to eliminating the debt, Jones said the symphony had
two other goals _ selling out their first performance and 50 percent
sales of the subscription tickets.
   ``Our opening concert has been sold out for over a week and our
subscription sales are running at 80 percent,'' he said.
   Shostakovich, music director of the symphony, will conduct a
program of Chopin, Brahms, and Wagner in the reopening concert. It
will be the third season for the son of the Russian composer Dmitri
Shostakovich.

memo that he will no longer honor claims he considers frivolous.
   In an order late Monday dismissing a North contention that
prosecutors were guilty of misconduct, Gesell blamed many of the
problems in handling secret documents on the Bush administration.
   The North trial was in recess Tuesday because of snow and
freezing rain.
   It has become clear, Gesell said in the written order, that many
documents were classified only for purposes of the North trial, now
in its fifth week, when they were not deemed secret before.
   Not that they all should be out in the open, the U.S. District
judge added.
   ``It is now abundantly clear that many documents that should have
been classified from the outset were not classified in any way, at
certain agencies such as the National Security Council and
Department of State,'' he wrote.
   No effort was made to follow rules set down for classification
and ``this has resulted in a haphazard process of review of
nonclassified materials to determine what can now be released
publicly,'' he said.
   Triggering the judge's ire was an instance last month while
Robert Owen, North's courier to the rebels fighting the Nicaraguan
government, was being questioned. During questioning about letters
Owen had written to North, prosecutors used versions of the letters
with some names and places censored.
   But it turned out that uncensored versions of the memos long ago
had been turned over by Owen's lawyer to a private group, the
Christic Institute, which was involved in a lawsuit, and that the
prosecution had known about it for two weeks. The Institute made the
uncut documents available to news organizations.
   Owen's lawyer said he had told prosecutors on Feb. 10 in the
office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh about the memos
becoming public. Informed at the time were office security chief
Allen Stansbury, prosecutor Michael Bromwich and another attorney in
the office. Stansbury asked Owen's lawyer to turn over the memos,
but he refused and no one in Walsh's office took any further action
until the Christic Institute announced its intention to publicize
the uncensored text.
   Stansbury ``made only a half-hearted attempt to retrieve copies
of the memoranda,'' said Gesell. ``He made no attempt to retrieve
them from the Christic Institute. ... He became uncertain and
confused. His boss at the Department of Justice was out of town and
he simply did not act. ... He proved incompetent for the task
assigned to him.''
   Bromwich, too, was to blame, said Gesell, for letting the matter
slip his mind but ``he had no purpose to conceal or to mislead.''
   The whole brouhaha, said Gesell, illustrates a problem ``which
continues to plague the course of the trial'' _ how to apply the law
which governs handling of secret material in court.
   While an interagency group has worked on classifying and
declassifying documents for trial, he said, it has at the same time
created uncertainty about the status of many papers.
   ``It leads to the often absurd situation where the press is
accurately reporting information in the public domain while the
court is confronted with representations that the same facts must
never be officially acknowledged,'' he said.
   Gesell called attention to an appeals court decision in another
case this year that district courts can ignore claims of
classification that are frivolous.
   Should the occasion warrant, said Gesell, he will do just that.

<HEAD>Bush Counters Commentaries That He's Moving Too Slowly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Reports that the Bush administration is off to
a stumbling start are common in the nation's capital, but the
president said they haven't reached Lubbock yet and he won't be
upset until they do.
   ``A lot is happening,'' said the president Tuesday, obviously
nettled by commentaries that very little appears to be going on in
his administration.
   ``Not all of it good, but a lot is happening,'' Bush told an
impromptu White House news conference.
   At the top of the list of the not-so-good things happening for
the new administration is the prolonged fight over the nomination of
former Texas Sen. John Tower to be secretary of defense.
   But that was not all. Critics have also said the administration
is moving very slowly in filling other posts.
   Bush said that was a bad rap and offered some numbers to make his
case.
   He noted that eight years ago, as President Reagan was forming
his administration, ``at this juncture 55 names, as of March 6th,
had been announced. On the Bush-Quayle administration, 67 have been
announced. So it's not bad. We're a little bit ahead in terms of
announced names.''
   David Gergen, a former Bush adviser and Reagan White House aide
who now is editor at large of U.S. News and World Report, put the
numbers in a different perspective in an article published last
weekend in the Washington Post.
   Gergen said the president had nominated people for only two of 41
Pentagon slots that require Senate confirmation. Gergen used similar
figures for other Cabinet departments _ two of 17 at Transportation,
two of 20 at Energy and one of 18 at Interior.
   Perhaps more telling than the numbers was the perception that
Bush was not matching his own rhetoric.
   The day after his election victory, Bush said, ``I will, for the
most part, bring in a brand new team of people from across the
country that will reinvigorate the process.''
   So far, the new team has a familiar look about it.
   To head the 14 Cabinet departments, Bush stuck with three
holdovers from the Reagan administration and chose three others who
had held Cabinet-level jobs in the preceding eight years.
   Four appointments went to veteran Washington hands who had served
in Congress, including Tower and former Reps. Jack Kemp, Manuel
Lujan and Edward Derwinski.
   One outsider nominated was Robert Mosbacher, very much a Bush
insider from Texas. The other three outsiders were Louis Sullivan,
James Watkins and Samuel Skinner.
   Not an unfriendly critic of the president, Gergen startled some
Washingtonians with such observations as, ``There is a deepening
sense in Washington that something is badly amiss in his (Bush's)
administration.
   ``Some of his most ardent friends furrow their brows and quietly
shake their heads. ... So far, despite some excellent appointments
at the top, it (the administration) has put together only a shell of
a government.''
   Gergen anticipated Bush's contention that all was well in the
West Texas city of Lubbock.
   He noted that President Carter, a Democrat, learned that when the
Washington Beltway crowd turns against an administration ``those
feelings ripple out and can eventually sink a president.''
   The first shots often are aimed at the chief of staff, in Bush's
case former Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire, a man who is
described as bright and abrasive _ in roughly equal proportions.
   ``Every chief of staff goes through this drill where he gets
saluted for his brilliance, and a month later he gets attacked for
his something else. And I have total confidence in John Sununu,''
said the president.
   While it was a heartfelt endorsement, the fact that Bush felt he
had to express his confidence in his chief of staff was an early
sign that the knives are out for the former governor.
   But it was a phone conversation with a supporter in Lubbock that
the president was most eager to talk about.
   The supporter, Bush said, had commented, ``All the people in
Lubbock think things are going just great.''
   Bush said he learned from the call ``never (to) get all too
up-tight about _ about stuff that hasn't reached Lubbock yet, and be
sure that there's some accomplishments going on,'' he said.
   That may prove true. But will it play in Peoria?

<HEAD>Character Actor Specialized in Army Roles, Had `Dynasty' Cameo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry Andrews, a craggy, jut-jawed character actor
who specialized in military roles, has died at the age of 77.
   Andrews died in his sleep Monday night at his home in the
southern village of Salehurst, said his agent, Lawrence Evans.
   Andrews made his stage debut at age 21 and had many Shakespearean
roles, including Horatio in ``Hamlet'' in New York in 1936. He
served as an artilleryman in World War II and made his first movie
in 1952, opposite Alan Ladd in ``The Red Beret.''
   He once said he was offered a Hollywood contract in his younger
days, but ``they wanted me to have my ears pinned back like Clark
Gable and the gap filled in between my front teeth. I wouldn't have
minded that, but then they said the name was too plain and would
have to go, and a bit of chin. So I said no.''
   Instead, he became a stalwart of postwar British cinema, most
memorably as the tough warden of a British army prison opposite Sean
Connery in the 1965 film ``The Hill.''
   Andrews' towering physique and growling voice made him a natural
for the part of a general in ``The Battle of Britain'' in 1969, but
he also showed a comic flair as the campy older man in 1970's
``Entertaining Mr. Sloane.''
   In 1985, he was in Hollywood appearing in a play when he was
asked to play a single-episode deathbed scene as Blake Carrington's
long-lost father in ``Dynasty.''
   Andrews told the Daily Mail he had never been a TV watcher, and
``I was startled when the Americans in my play kept saying to me,
`Gosh, an episode of `Dynasty.' What an accolade!'''
   Actress Sylvia Syms, who starred with Andrews in the 1958 war
movie ``Ice Cold in Alex,'' remembered him as ``the gentle giant.''
   ``He was a perfect gentleman and a lovely, soft-spoken man... I
can't think of anything nasty to say about him, except that he had
bony knees.''

   Eastern Airlines struggled to restore its
Northeast shuttle Tuesday, throwing its strike-diminished work force
into an intense battle with competitor Pan Am for the lucrative line.
   ``Fly Us With No Reservations,'' Eastern declared in full-page
newspaper advertisements, pledging routine service between
Washington, New York and Boston. ``Our No. 1 priority is to keep the
shuttle flying.''
   But ridership was low at Eastern, while Pan Am, moving
aggressively to capture Eastern regulars, reported strong shuttle
business. Since the strike Saturday, Pan Am has doubled its
rush-hour service, added a bigger airplane and aggressively promoted
its frequent-flier program to shuttle passengers.
   ``We don't look at this as extra capacity for a few days. We look
at it as an opportunity to win long-term allegiance,'' said Pan Am
spokesman Jeff Kriendler. ``We are trying to take advantage of the
special opportunity.''
   ``It's fair,'' said Tim Cook, a spokesman for Eastern, which is
selling its shuttle to developer Donald Trump. If the tables were
turned, he said, ``We'd be doing the same thing.''
   Eastern, which has operated its shuttle for 27 years, held just
over half the business before the strike, for a profit of about $30
million last year. The rest _ roughly 5,000 passengers each weekday
_ had been gradually wrested away by Pan Am since it opened its
shuttle in 1986.
   Cook said Eastern operated 60 percent of its shuttle flights
Monday _ the others canceled by snow, not strikers _ and hoped to
fly them all Tuesday, despite continued bad weather. Crews were
mainly management employees.
   Patronage was low. A source at Eastern, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it had been averaging 15 or 20 passengers per
shuttle flight. Ronnet Anderson, a New Yorker on the 9 a.m. shuttle
from Washington, said it carried just four passengers.
   ``A lot of people went over to Pan Am just to avoid the hassle,''
Cook conceded. ``But we're routine today and expect to be routine
from here on out.''
   The problem may not be Eastern's for long, with a pending $365
million sale to Trump. Some Wall Street analysts suggested the
strike, if it led to bankruptcy, could endanger the sale; others
said Trump will be getting a somewhat tarnished property.
   ``The hardest thing in any marketing business is to get somebody
to try your product,'' said Louis Marckesano, airline analyst at the
Philadelphia brokerage house Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ``If Pan
Am indeed is able to provide a good product, there's a good chance
they'll be able to keep at least some of the additional traffic
they've taken from Eastern.''
   But Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle Inc., said he was
``not the least bit worried.''
   ``I think when we start operating it's going to be big news,''
Nobles said. ``I think the Trump name is a very powerful name. We
are not worried about whether we're starting from one market share
or another market share.''
   Pan Am _ which has gone so far as to laminate shuttle travelers'
business cards into free luggage tags at its terminals this week _
had another view.
   ``This just gives us a golden opportunity to get those Eastern
diehard passengers,'' said Perette Ross, shuttle marketing director
for Pan Am. ``Hopefully they'll become loyalists to the Pan Am
shuttle.''

<TEXT>
   A bomb hidden in a car exploded during the
Tuesday morning rush hour near the American University hospital in
Moslem west Beirut, killing two women and wounding 21, police said.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt blamed the bomb on Gen. Michel
Aoun's Christian Cabinet, charging its was part of the Lebanese
leader's efforts to neutralize the war-torn nation's private armies.
   ``I looked out of the window and saw fire blazing in several
cars, a corpse in the middle of the street and people running in all
directions,'' said a man who watched the blast form a nearby
building. He refused to give his name.
   The fourth car bomb in Lebanon this year was placed in a yellow
Fiat that exploded in front of a fruit and vegetable stall off the
main Hamra commercial thoroughfare.
   A woman maneuvering to park her car near the yellow Fiat was
killed when the bomb went off, a police spokesman said. The blast
threw her body from the car.
   He said the second woman, a passer-by, suffered serious head
wounds and died later in the hospital.
   The bomb triggered fires in nine cars parked near the stall and
shattered windows in surrounding buildings.
   Panicking motorists caused several accidents as the tried to flee
the scene, said a woman who identified herself only as a telephone
operator from the nearby Cavalier Hotel.
   Ambulances were slowed by rush-hour traffic, the police spokesman
said.
   Accountant Jamal Hamoud said he watched as ``gunmen fired their
rifles in the air to make way for the ambulances.''
   Ambulances evacuated only three of the wounded.
   ``Civilians carried most of the casualties on their backs to the
American University hospital,'' a few hundred yards away, the police
spokesman said.
   Most of those injured suffered minor cuts from glass shards, he
said.
   Jumblatt, whose Progressive Socialist Party militia is allied
with the Syrians who police west Beirut, said the bomb was a warning
from Aoun.
   ``Those who are trying to encircle us, today sent us a
booby-trapped message,'' Jumblatt claimed.
   He was referring to efforts by Aoun's helicopter gunships and
gunboats to prevent merchant ships from docking at illegal port
facilities run by his and other militias along Lebanon's coastline.
   The air-and-sea patrols started Monday, ignoring rocket fire by
Jumblatt's militia based near Jiye port, south of Beirut.
   Aoun's aim to choke off the main revenues of private armies has
provoked objections from Syrian-backed Moslem leaders who consider
it an attempt to restrict their operations.
   Moslems refuse to recognize Aoun's military Cabinet, appointed by
outgoing President Amin Gemayel in September after parliament failed
to elect his successor. They pledge allegiance to the Moslem Cabinet
of Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who governed under Gemayel.
   By police count, 11 people were killed and 47 wounded in three
January car bombings.
   Twenty car bombs exploded in 1988, killing 116 people and
wounding 488.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Justices Plead for Budget Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked Congress for
a budget increase of $1.4 million to ease what one justice said is
such a severe money pinch the court is having trouble paying for
typewriter repairs.
   ``We're hurting,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told a House
Appropriations subcommittee. ``We have a real strain on our budget.
We can't keep our typewriters operating.''
   The court is asking for $17.3 million for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, an increase of a little more than $1.4 million
over the current budget.
   Rep. Joseph D. Early, D-Mass., gave a mixed reception to O'Connor
and Justice Antonin Scalia, who also spoke in support of the budget
request.
   ``I'm really not that sympathetic,'' he said. ``We can't be all
things to all people.''
   But later Early expressed support and urged the justices to speak
out more forcefully to attract attention to the court's plight.
   ``It's ludicrous to treat you the same way as anyone else,'' he
said. ``We've got to spend more money.''
   ``I don't know waht you should be doing, all threatening to
resign or something,'' Early said.
   Adding that the entire federal court system needs more money, he
said, ``There's not one federal judge who couldn't leave and
increase his salary by 20 to 25 percent.''
   Underscoring the point, O'Connor said she knew of one former
clerk to a Supreme Court justice who recently left for private law
practice and ``is earning more than the justices.''
   The annual salary of a Supreme Court justice is $110,000.
   Included in the court's budget request are $110,000 for library
shelves and $160,000 to improve its computer system.
   O'Connor said 18 staff positions at the court have not been
filled because of a hiring freeze imposed to meet budget restraints.
   ``Every (justice's) chambers and office of the court has been
affected by the hiring freeze,'' she said. It ``is having a negative
impact on the efficiency and morale of remaining employees who must
take on extra work when positions become vacant.''
   Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, the subcommittee chairman, said, ``You
shouldn't have to put up with it. We'll see what we can do.''

<HEAD>Actress Joins Campaign Targeting Pesticides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Meryl Streep joined forces with a
public interest group Tuesday in launching a nationwide campaign to
focus attention on concerns about the health effects of pesticides
on young children.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, a private environmental
group, recently gained widespread attention when it issued a report
claiming the Environmental Protection Agency does not adequately
take into account the relativley high consumption of fruits and
vegetables by children when setting limits on cancer-causing
pesticides.
   The EPA has denied the allegations and said that children are not
exposed to an unusual health risk because of the pesticides.
   Ms. Streep said she hoped the campaign would put pressure on the
government to re-examine its methods of setting pesticide standards
on fruits and vegetables and promote the shift to organic farming so
that such pesticides could be eliminated.
   ``As parents, we care passionately about our children. We
shouldn't have to worry about the safety of the food we feed them,
especially fruits and vegetables that are essential to our
children's health,'' said Ms. Streep, who has three children.
   She is co-chair of ``Mothers and Others for Pesticide Limits,''
which was formed to coordinate the campaign. Ms. Streep also agreed
to take part in a television advertisement cautioning parents about
the use of pesticides on fruits and their potential effects on
children.
   The group has bought time on a Washington television station for
the ad and plans to distribute it elsewhere around the country as a
public service announcement, said a spokesman, David Fenton.

   President Bush asserted Tuesday that he is as
committed to human rights as former President Reagan had been, even
though Bush didn't publicly focus on the issue during his recent
trip to China.
   ``I think quiet discussion is a good approach to try to effect
the human rights objectives that I feel very strongly about,'' Bush
told a White House news conference.
   The president defended his conduct in not making a big issue of
an incident in which Chinese police prevented dissident Fang Lizhi
from attending a barbecue in Beijing last week hosted by Bush.
   Fang had been on Bush's invitation list.
   ``The very invitation to that dissident that they thoroughly
disapproved of shows our public commitment to it (human rights),''
Bush said.
   Reagan raised human rights issues in each of his meetings with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and once invited a group of
Soviet dissidents to meet with him in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   On a trip to China in 1984, Reagan protested angrily when Chinese
authorities censored parts of his nationally televised address,
including a portion dealing with religion.
   Still, Bush sought to draw a parallel between his own
presentation of human-rights concerns in meetings with foreign
leaders and Reagan's approach.
   ``You know, there's two schools of how you do the human rights
agenda,'' he said. ``I think that President Reagan was correct when
he raised the human rights agenda with the Soviets privately rather
than beating his breast and doing it publicly.''
   ``And I think the results have been rather penetrating, still a
long way to go with the Soviets,'' Bush said.
   During his China trip, Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater,
said that Bush had not raised the issues of human rights with
Chinese leaders _ presumably including the key issue of human rights
in Tibet, scene of recent clashes between police and rioters seeking
independence from Beijing.
   China on Tuesday imposed martial law in the Tibetan capital of
Lhasa after three days of anti-Chinese rioting.
   Bush on Tuesday said that the press secretary's statement was
true up the point that Fitzwater spoke, but that he later raised the
general issue in a private meeting with Chinese senior leader Deng
Xiaopeng.
   ``It was raised by me personally,'' he said.
   On the subject of linking economic concessions to the Soviets to
human-rights progress, including an easing of emigration
restrictions on Soviet Jews, Bush said: ``There's clearly got to be
some linkage.''
   ``When Soviets come out of Afghanistan, which happened here not
so long ago, give them credit for that. When you get some lightening
up a little bit on the question of Soviet Jews or something of that
nature, give some credit,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   A top U.S. Roman Catholic church official
says he expects ``points of difference'' to emerge between the
Vatican and American bishops but no confrontation in an
extraordinary meeting beginning Wednesday.
   ``There will be probably, in any free-flowing discussion, points
of difference _ points of difference that will be discussed and
faced,'' said Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis, president of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   He didn't go into specifics, but there have been differences over
the right of Catholics to dissent from church teaching to how much
weight bishops' conferences should have.
   Thirty-five U.S. prelates gathered Tuesday in Rome on the eve of
the four-day meeting with Pope John Paul II and top Vatican
officials.
   The U.S. bishops originally had requested the meeting in 1986,
when tensions with the Vatican were high over its disciplining of
several clergy members considered too permissive on such issues as
ministering to homosexual groups and artificial birth control, which
the church bans.
   As tensions eased in recent years, the bishops considered
dropping the request. However, the pope wanted the meeting held,
according to Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   In his speeches to American Catholics, the pontiff has expressed
concern about people who disagree with church teaching and practice
what Vatican officials call ``cafeteria Catholicism'' _ obeying some
doctrines and ignoring others.
   In this week's meetings, he and other Vatican officials are
expected to encourage the bishops to be ardent proponents of church
teaching in a secular society.
   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the West German who heads the powerful
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, will deliver a major
address Wednesday that is expected to set the Vatican's tone for the
meeting. A Vatican source described it as a ``thought-provoking''
talk.
   Vatican officials stress the meeting won't be confrontational.
   May said the bishops hoped to bring to Rome a better
understanding of the 52 million-member American Catholic Church.
   ``There's been a lack of understanding on the part of some people
(in the Vatican),'' he said in an interview Tuesday. ``Some of these
men have not been in the United States, or not very much ... some of
them haven't been as fully conversant with our ways of doing things
in a cultural contest.''
   He said he hoped for a ``deeper understanding of separation of
church and state, a deeper understanding of the freedom of thought
in the United States ... a deeper understanding of the democratic
process that we're used to, which is not always the way things are
done in the church.''
   He added that the pope ``seems to have gotten a new vision'' of
the United States from his trips there and meetings with American
bishops last year.
   ``I think it (the meeting) will be significant in the life of the
church,'' said May. ``It will probably build a stronger sense of
unity between the Vatican and the bishops, a better understanding
and realization of how we're all try to do the same thing in
different contexts.''
   The pope has held extraordinary meetings with bishops from
Brazil, to discuss liberation theology, and bishops from Holland,
where the church was split into conservative and liberal factions
over issues such as celibacy and the role of women in the church.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met
with the Soviet foreign minister Tuesday and agreed to visit Moscow
in May, where they will discuss prospects for a Bush-Gorbachev
summit.
   His two-hour meeting with Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Vienna took
place the day after they outlined their governments' positions at a
35-nation conference on reducing conventional military forces in
Europe. Baker's plane made a refueling stop in Shannon on the flight
home.
   Baker resisted a Soviet overture to reopen negotiations in April
or May on reducing long-range _ or strategic _ nuclear missiles. He
said the Bush administration wants to complete parallel reviews of
its arms control policy and nuclear force structure before resuming
the talks.
   Reopening the talks on long-range bombers, nuclear submarines and
missiles will be discussed during the visit to Moscow in the first
half of May, after the parallel studies are completed in April, he
said.
   In Vienna after the meeting, Baker told reporters the United
States ``is not ready to set a date'' at this point for a summit
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The secretary criticized the Soviets about Iran and military aid
to the leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua. He said Moscow
was ``posturing'' on Iran, which Shevardnadze visited recently, and
had helped arm Nicaragua in a ``way out of proportions'' manner that
threatens its Central American neighbors.
   A senior State Department official traveling with Baker said the
Soviet offer to mediate the furor over British writer Salman
Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' interferes with a U.S.
campaign to isolate Iran.
   Iran's fundamentalist Shiite Moslem regime believes the novel
blasphemes Islam and its patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has
ordered his followers to kill the author. Iran broke relations with
Britain on Tuesday because it did not condemn the book and prosecute
Rushdie.
   Despite clear differences on those and other issues, the
get-acquainted session between Baker and Shevardnadze appeared to go
well. Baker said it was held ``in a very positive atmosphere,
reflecting a determination to cooperate.''
   As they parted at the residence of Henry Grunwald, the U.S.
ambassador to Austria, Shevardnadze ``told me it was a very good
beginning, and I would agree with that,'' Baker said.
   Baker objected to the Soviet attempt in Vienna to seek reductions
in combat aircraft and naval forces and also eliminate short-range,
or battlefield, nuclear weapons. He said the mandate for
negotiations that begin Thursday excludes missiles and ships.
   Shevardnadze's proposal for separate negotiations on the nuclear
weapons with ranges of up to 300 miles conflicts with U.S.
determination to keep Lance missiles in West Germany and triple
their current range of about 70 miles.
   On Monday night, a senior State Department official briefing
reporters under rules of anonymity said the Soviets were looking for
``fissures'' in the Western alliance.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany has proposed delaying the
Lance modernization for two or three years.
   On the trip home, Baker said Soviet suggestions for conventional
force reduction were ``remarkably close to the NATO proposal.''
   NATO has called for sharp reductions in Warsaw Pact tanks,
artillery and armored personnel carriers to Western levels, followed
by additional cuts of 5-10 percent on both sides.
   Shevardnadze proposed a first-phase reduction of 15 percent by
1992 and 40 percent by 1995.
   U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce long-range arms have been
suspended for three months. In mid-February, Bush postponed a
resumption until the policy review was completed.
   Shevardnadze told a news conference in Vienna he suggested to
Baker the talks resume in April or May but the secretary said the
United States ``will need more time.''
   On the plane, Baker said he told Shevardnadze it was ``premature
to lock in on a date now,'' with the review in process. He added to
reporters: ``It is our strong desire to build on the progress that
has been made to date.''
   When the talks were suspended, negotiators had reached tentative
agreement on several weapon ceilings but were having trouble on ways
to guard against cheating.

<HEAD>Rare News Conference Reveals Soviet Reformers Began Work in 1983</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   Soviet reformers began planning their economic
program two years before Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985,
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said Tuesday, and he implied they molded
communist ideology to fit.
   ``We had to find theoretical foundations for all the actions that
we wanted to pursue afterward,'' Ryzhkov said.
   In a rare news conference that offered an unusual glimpse of the
personality of a Soviet leader, Ryzhkov also revealed he is a
workaholic who loves to read, misses the smell of newly machined
metal from the factory where he spent 20 years, and is frustrated at
the slow pace of reform.
   ``We have to have a lot of patience to implement what we have
decided, because the scale of the country is so vast,'' he told 33
women journalists gathered in ornate St. Catherine's Hall of the
Grand Kremlin Palace on the eve of International Women's Day.
   Ryzhkov said planning for perestroika _ Gorbachev's program of
economic and social reforms _ began two years before Gorbachev was
elected head of the Communist Party. That would be in 1983, about
the time former KGB chief Yuri Andropov came to power.
   ``Even at that time, we had forces who understood that everything
was not healthy in our economy,'' Ryzhkov said.
   For the first two years after Gorbachev took over in 1985, they
worked on theory that would support their ideas, he said.
   Gorbachev has rejected many long-standing Soviet principles in
his effort to revive a sickly economy. He is trying to do away with
a system in which Moscow bureaucrats decide what is produced
throughout the country, and trying to transform the word ``profit''
from the height of capitalist evil to a measurement of socialist
success.
   Ryzhkov also promised to reveal the long-secret Soviet defense
budget in 12 to 18 months, after accountants have arranged it in a
form comparable to U.S. figures, apparently for use in arms
negotiations.
   As part of the plan to shift Soviet spending ``from swords to
plowshares,'' defense factories that produce 60 percent military
hardware and 40 percent consumer goods will move to a 50-50 ratio by
1991 and 40-60 by 1995, he said. For example, the Moscow Aviation
Factory soon will produce pasta, he said.
   Ryzhkov, whose popularity soared in December when he was seen
nightly on Soviet TV cmmiserating with Armenian earthquake victims,
said he found the slow pace of economic reform the most upsetting
part of his job.
   ``I like to see how the decisions we are taking in the state
bodies are implemented in the level of real life,'' he said. That's
why he enjoys visiting factories that remind him of the Ural
Machine-Building Plant in Sverdlovsk where his career began, ``to
feel the smell of machine parts being manufactured, the smell of
real work,'' he said.
   Ryzhkov blamed part of the country's problems on corrupt
bureaucrats, and he made no promises of quick dividends from
perestroika, saying 40 percent of factory equipment must be replaced.
   ``We have to make certain investments, we have to have know-how,
and we have to have time for that,'' he said.
   The premier also tackled the notorious shortage of laundry soap.
   ``In Moscow, we used to sell 80 tons of detergent daily. Now we
sell 300 tons daily, and still we have lines for detergent.'' Then
he quipped, ``I don't believe the overall washing has increased all
that much.''
   He suggested that journalists created a self-fulfilling prophecy
by publicizing a soap shortage until people began hoarding even more.
   To eliminate shortages, he said, wages must stop rising faster
than retail trade and productivity.
   In an unusual discussion of his personal life, Ryzhkov said he
answers his own phone in a 13-hour to 14-hour workday, and continues
work at home. As a result, he misses the theater and concerts.
   The 59-year-old premier said his wife, Ludmila, is a mechanical
engineer who designed excavators at the same factory where he rose
to director. He said she reads extensively on the countries they
visit and works on behalf of orphans.
   Ryzhkov said his daughter is a law professor at the Academy of
the Interior Ministry, and her husband also is a lawyer, in the
customs office. They have two children, Ludmila, 2, and Nikolai, 6.
   In remarks appropriate to the women's holiday, Ryzhkov promised
to reduce the time women waste in food lines and to cut the female
workforce in hard-labor jobs.
   Women already hold 25 percent of the management jobs in the
Soviet Union, and this should expand under perestroika, Ryzhkov said.
   ``Until now, administrative methods were more suited to a man
with a loud voice,'' he said. ``Now we have to control the economy
not with a shout but with an intellect, and that will allow women to
have their say.''

   The strike by machinists at Eastern Airlines is
viewed as pivotal for organized labor, which is eager to see how the
government handles the dispute and the implications for workers'
rights in the 1990s.
   Ironically, the unions are looking for help to a railway labor
law, which it once vigorously opposed. The law allows the president,
if he chooses, to intervene. It also allows secondary boycotts in
strikes involving railroads and airlines.
   Not since former President Reagan ushered in a new hard line
against labor when he fired 11,000 federal air traffic controllers
in an illegal strike in 1981 have the stakes in a strike been
greater than in the dispute at Eastern.
   Employers in the recession years of 1981 and 1982 did not
hesitate to demand wage concessions from workers and get them.
Automatic inflation-indexed, cost-of-living adjustments that were a
fixture of labor contracts in previous decades disappeared from many
settlements in the '80s.
   Steel, auto and rubber workers counting on $15 to $21 hourly
wages took wage cuts, as did meatpackers and airline workers paid
half as much.
   Those who balked _ copper miners in Arizona, meatpackers in
Minnesota or pilots and machinists at Continental Airlines after
Frank Lorenzo acquired it _ found themselves on the street, replaced
by non-union workers often willing to work for half as much.
   The return of national economic prosperity after the recession
did not reverse the trend.
   But through it all, two groups of union workers were able to
preserve and in some cases even increase their wages relative to
inflation: teachers and other state, county and municipal employees,
and railroad workers.
   The first group did it through a recognition that U.S.
educational standards were falling, by using public sector
collective bargaining laws enacted under President John F. Kennedy,
and by demonstrating an ability to cut off vital public services.
   Rail workers persevered largely through the 1926 National Railway
Labor Act, a law governing labor relations in both railroads and
airlines and passed largely in an effort to stem union power through
government intervention and maintain transportation vital to
interstate commerce.
   Recent uses of the railway labor law have raised union hopes.
   The president and Congress have broad powers under the railway
labor law to impose contract settlements on management and unions
through Presidential Emergency Boards. They lack those powers in
other sectors of the economy.
   Reagan used the mechanism several times, blocking threatened
railroad strikes and effectively stifling management bids for
concessions.
   And although the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act forbids striking union
members at one company from picketing another company, the Supreme
Court in 1987 upheld the legality of such secondary boycotts at
railroads and airlines.
   Unions are counting on that combination to defeat Eastern
Airlines and Lorenzo, its principal owner, whom AFL-CIO President
Lane Kirkland this week called the ``Typhoid Mary of union busters
in the transportation industry.''
   It was Lorenzo who acquired Continental Airlines in 1981 and then
declared bankruptcy two years later _ a move that allowed him to
cancel all of the company's union contracts. Eventually all of the
union workers were replaced.
   The Supreme Court later upheld Lorenzo's right to abrogate
Continental's labor contracts under the bankruptcy statutes,
creating a fear among labor leaders that the example could be
followed by any company.
   The AFL-CIO spearheaded legislation passed by Congress in 1985
changing the law, but ever since then Lorenzo has been at the top of
the labor organization's enemies list.
   Bringing an end to the favored tax treatment given debt-financed
leveraged buyouts exemplified by Lorenzo's acquisition of Eastern in
1986 has this year replaced trade at the top of labor's legislative
agenda.
   Kirkland acknowledged the ``broad implications'' if Eastern
succeeds in cutting the pay of its aircraft mechanics by $4,000 a
year and its ramp workers by $8,000 annually as demanded in the
company's last offer before the strike Saturday.
   ``There are no doubt those who are cheering him on in management
and certain circles in corporate America who want to see his tactics
succeed,'' he said Monday. ``This company is not in trouble because
of the wages it pays _ labor costs at Eastern are lower than other
airlines operating profitably and efficiently.''
   ``This company is in trouble because it's in hock to the banks
some $2.5 billion,'' Kirkland said. ``The interest cost on that debt
... in excess of $800,000 a day ... is virtually equal to the amount
this company is losing.
   ``This is not an atypical situation in American industry with the
vast infection of leveraged buyouts and enormous debt loads that
have been saddled on otherwise good companies.''

<BYLINE>Soviet Pacific Ports Rebuff Attempts by Nuclear-Powered Ship to
Dock ^By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Soviet Far East ports and a nearby region have
refused entry to a nuclear-powered Soviet merchant ship for fear it
is radioactive, and a newspaper likened the vessel Tuesday to a
``homeless child.''
   The 860-foot Sevmorput, launched only months ago, had been
anchored off Vladivostok for four days because the city council
refused entry, the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya said. It said city
officials decided March 2 not to let the ship dock until they
receive additional information about its radiation safeguards.
   Officials of Nakhodka and the nearby Magadan region also refused
port calls after tens of thousands of residents protested to a radio
station, the newspaper said.
   Izvestia, the government daily, reported on opposition to the
Sevmorput on March 2. A report in a third newspaper Saturday said
said a meltdown in a nuclear reactor on another Soviet ship was
narrowly averted.
   The Sovietskaya Rossiya article indicated residents became
fearful of the Sevmorput because they had not been given details
about problems with it.
   Fractures appeared in the $260 million barge carrier soon after
it began its maiden voyage Dec. 31 from the Crimean port of Kerch to
the Far East, the newspaper said.
   Experts rushed in to check whether radiation was released and
found the ship clean, confirming its ``atomic heart'' was not
damaged, the article said. It did not say how the damage occurred or
precisely when the incident occurred.
   According to the newspaper, the ship has good safeguards and
could even withstand the crash of a jetliner or a collision with a
huge icebreaker, but it added:
   ``A deficit of information, piled on top of the invisible shadow
of the Chernobyl tragedy and the most complex ecological situation
in the region, detonated a powerful explosion of public
indignation.''
   Public opposition to nuclear power has grown since the explosion
and fire April 26, 1986, at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the
Ukraine. At least 31 people were killed and the plant spewed
radioactivity that eventually spread around the world.
   Authorities are closing a nuclear power plant in Armenia, a
region prone to earthquakes, and have canceled plans to expand other
plants.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said the Sevmorput was like a ``sea
monster,'' uneconomical because of its size. It said the ship would
lose $19.3 million this year and $22.9 million in 1990.
   It described the vessel to an ``offended homeless child'' and
said every day it is idle costs $88,525.
   On Saturday, the newspaper Vodny Transport said a reactor
meltdown nearly occurred Nov. 11 on the icebreaker Rossiya while it
was docked at the northern port of Murmansk. It said operator error
was responsible.

<HEAD>Annunzio Says Commemorative Coin-Sales Law Cuts National Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., says the national
debt has been reduced by about $750 million through sales of U.S.
commemorative coins and related programs but more must be done ``to
get this terrible debt under control.''
   Annunzio, a former chairman of the House Banking, Finance and
Urban Affairs Committee's subcommittee on consumer affairs and
coinage, says a law earmarking profits from sales of commemorative
coins to reduce the national debt has been ``a step in the right
direction, but we need to take a lot of steps to pay off this
debt,'' which now stands at about $2.7 trillion.
   ``We've got to earmark tax money or even have a surtax. I know
some people won't like to hear that talk about a surtax, but we've
got to get this terrible debt under control. It's the biggest, most
serious problem facing this country today,'' Annunzio said Monday.
   A law passed in 1982 authorizing the U.S. Mint to sell gold and
silver coins and use proceeds for debt retirement and other special
purposes ``is my own small way of dealing with the problem,''
Annunzio said.
   According to the subcomittee, which Annunzio headed for a decade,
profits from the sales are approaching $960 million.
   Of that, it said $742 million is money to reduce the debt and
$214 million is for special programs _ support of U.S. Olympic
athletes and restoration of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.
   The debt-reduction figure includes $409 million from profits on
commemorative coins, $200 million from sales of gold and silver
coins, $25 million last year from special collector coin sets and a
projected profit of $108 million from the 1988 Olympic coin program.
   ``There was no coin program before I became chairman,'' Annunzio
said. ``Now, we have this clicking on all cylinders. ... I just hope
to God it doesn't go down the drain.''
   He said private marketers of coins and precious metals opposed
the legislation when Congress first considered it, ``and they'll
never give up, especially now that I'm gone.''
   ``I don't think there's all that much support for private
enterprise to take over,'' said Greg De Niro, a dealer at the
Maryland Coin Exchange in Silver Spring, Md.
   ``Personally, as both a dealer and a collector, I'm very happy
with the way things are now,'' he said Tuesday. ``The government
makes a profit. So do we. ... It's been a good for everyone
involved.''
   Annunzio left the coinage panel chairmanship this year to become
chairman of the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision,
regulations and insurance.

   The U.S. Army said Tuesday it
believes it knows where a young soldier was during an 11-day
disappearance near the East German border, but it declined to
elaborate.
   Electronics specialist Michael A. Peri, 21, of Laguna Niguel,
Calif., had been missing from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in
Fulda since Feb. 21, but returned voluntarily Saturday.
   The Army said he has been charged with being absent without leave
and with violating military regulations by coming within a little
more than a half-mile of the East German border.
   ``We have an idea where he was, but we have no additional
information to release pending completion of the investigation
surrounding the circumstances of his absense,'' said Maj. Dennis
Pinkham.
   In an interview from the U.S. military's European Command
headquarters in Stuttgart, Pinkham said it was ``routine procedure,
not to reveal details about such an investigation until it is
completed.''
   Peri, who worked in a military intelligence office in Fulda,
about 65 miles northeast of Frankfurt, had in his possession a
portable computer missing from his office when he returned.
   In addition, a military vehicle Peri had signed out was found
Feb. 23 abandoned undamaged near the town of Obersuhl, in the
restricted zone along the East German border, prompting initial
speculation that he may have defected.
   Peri has been confined to a military detention center in
Mannheim, said Lt. Col. Jake Dye, spokesman for the U.S. Army 5th
Corps.
   Theft charges also filed against Peri applied to the vehicle and
other items, including the portable computer Peri took from the
office where he worked, Dye said.
   Peri's disappearance baffled military officials, who said he had
been a model soldier.
   Peri had worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist and
was responsible for monitoring radar and other military signals. He
has been stationed in West Germany for a year.

   Protesters fighting a high-speed rail link between
London and the Channel Tunnel said Tuesday they had won major
concessions from British Rail, including slower trains and tunnels
over one-third of the route.
   The council of the London borough of Lewisham said it obtained
the information from a leaked copy of a British Rail document. The
state-owned rail company declined to comment, saying it would
publish its proposals Wednesday.
   Lewisham is campaigning with residents of southeast England
against plans to cut a new high-speed rail route through London and
the countryside to the rail tunnel under the English Channel that
will link England and France. The channel tunnel is to open in 1993.
   The London-Folkestone route is a hot political issue for Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher. It is also a serious ecological issue
that comes at a time when Mrs. Thatcher needs to demonstrate concern
for the environment.
   Council spokesman Graham Taylor said that according to the
document, 24.6 miles of the 68-mile route would run underground, and
maximum rail speeds would be 140 mph instead of the previously
suggested 180 mph.

   Riots over police brutality broke out
Tuesday during the funeral of a man killed by police last week,
witnesses said.
   Mourners, some of whom carried signs saying ``No to police
brutality,'' attacked police trucks following the funeral, according
to the witnesses. No injuries were reported.
   The violence spread quickly as rioters attacked government
vehicles trapped in the traffic jam created by the protest,
witnesses said.
   On Friday night, police shot and killed three people after a bus
driver, fleeing a traffic police officer, ran over and killed an
elderly man.
   Last month, a court sentenced to death a policemen for the 1987
shooting of two brothers. The court ruled the murder, which started
rioting in which eight people died, was not justifiable.

<HEAD>Mad Motorists Fighting Tolls With Vengeance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorists angered by having to pay both
bridge tolls and higher taxes are fighting back, dropping everything
from cherry bombs to bras into toll baskets. A couple of the baskets
have even been shot at.
   A year ago, Jacksonville citizens voted to replace the city's
many bridge and road tolls with a half-cent sales tax.
   The tax has been in place since Jan. 1. The tolls go on.
   ``Either tax us or toll us, but not both together at the same
time. We're being raped. Financially raped,'' said Sally Gooch, 38,
whose weekly driving takes her over some of the four pay bridges
spanning the St. Johns River.
   City officials say residents got just what the voted for _ if
they read the fine print.
   The tolls remain until state bridge bonds can be refinanced using
the tax as a basis of repayment instead of the tolls. Officials say
the refinancing could take six months. If the task isn't done by
Dec. 31, the law says the tax will be repealed.
   The mayor has vowed the tolls will be gone by September.
   Many motorists don't buy the vows and explanations.
   The 35-year-old toll machines are being hit by liquid soap,
cherry bombs, razor blades and gum. Other items found include
chicken dinner leftovers, marijuana, bras, shrimp, beer cans and
women's underpants.
   ``We've got a real mess out there between now and September,''
said Lou Hazlett, regional toll manager for the Florida Department
of Transportation. Motorists, he said, have even opened fire on toll
machines. ``We had two of them shot just last week,'' he said.
   Toll collectors aren't faring much better.
   ``Drivers are throwing plums at them. One grabbed a collector's
arm and then drove off, dragging her out of the booth. Others throw
their money on the ground. When you confront them, they say the
collector didn't reach out far enough,'' said Marie Belch,
supervisor of the Matthews Bridge toll plaza.
   For a time, about 14 percent of those passing through the
unmanned lanes weren't paying the tolls, which translated at one
point to $115,000 in lost monthly toll revenue.
   Officials responded to that by hiring more off-duty Jacksonville
police to issue $52 tickets to those who don't pay, and officials
say that has helped.
   Mayor Tommy Hazouri vowed last week, ``If I have to stand on the
road and do it myself, those booths will come down in September.''
   ``Trust me,'' he said.
   Hazouri, who campaigned in 1987 on a plank of getting rid of the
tolls, is being bombarded with satire.
   A local radio station started playing ``Tommy,'' sung to the tune
of ``Darlene.''
   ``We voted you mayor of Jax. Remember it was tolls or tax. Just
tell us the truth. Take those dern tolls down. Tommy, please don't
let us down,'' the song goes.
   The Florida Times-Union, the local newspaper, runs a small daily
item called ``... and counting'' featuring the number of days that
both the tax and tolls have been in effect.
   ``We call it double taxation and they call it co-collection,''
said attorney John Bryant, an opponent of the tax.

   President Bush said Tuesday there ``clearly has
to be some linkage'' between U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union and
the Soviets' behavior in Central America.
   U.S. officials have long complained that the Soviets give
military aid to the leftist Nicaraguan government that the
administration-backed Contras are trying to oust.
   Bush administration officials have said they are hopeful the
Soviets might change that approach, a change that might be
encouraged by U.S. willingness to deal in other areas such as trade
and technology with economic benefit to the Soviets.
   The president said Tuesday in a news conference, ``The more help
we can get towards that end by the Soviets, with pulling back their
large amount of military support, the better it would be between
relations. So there is linkage.''
   He said of the Soviets that the United States should ``give them
credit'' when ``something good happens,'' such as their military
pullout from Afghanistan and the easing of restrictions on Soviet
Jews.
   ``I don't know exactly how to help you in terms of how much
linkage there is, but there's clearly got to be some linkage,'' Bush
told a reporter who questioned him on the Nicaraguan issue.
   He declined to give specifics, saying the matter is still under
policy review by his young administration.
   The State Department's preliminary estimates are that Soviet
weapons deliveries to Nicaragua last year totaled $515 million, the
highest total since 1980 when the Soviets first started aid to
Nicaragua.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III had been expected to bring
up the subject of U.S.-Soviet cooperation in the Central American
peace effort during his talks this week with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze in Vienna, sources said.
   Baker has indicated he might entertain the idea of U.S.
concessions to the Soviets in certain areas if they show what the
U.S. government considers good faith in dealing with Nicaragua.
   Bush on Tuesday reiterated his support for keeping the Contras
going with non-military aid while the Nicaraguan government is made
to prove it will live up to democratization promises it makes in a
peace agreement being worked out by the Central American presidents.
   `I hope there is some understanding on the (Capitol) Hill that
these people must not be left without humanitarian aid. ... We
simply cannot and I will not leave the Contras out there with no
humanitarian aid at all,'' the president said.
   Asked about the possibility of military aid, which would have dim
prospects in Congress, Bush said, ``We are talking ... about how
best to move the process of democratization forward.''
   He said he would look for ``clear statements'' on democratization
in the agreement being worked out by Nicaragua's President Daniel
Ortega and the presidents of Central America's four democracies. The
document also would include disbanding the Contras.
   When Baker visited Capitol Hill last week to consult with members
of Congress on a Contra aid package, he carried proposals that also
would offer the Sandinistas economic incentives if they show what
the administration considers progress in such areas as press and
political freedoms.

   Industrialized nations committed themselves Tuesday
to banning chemicals destroying the ozone layer, but they reacted
coolly to Third World demands for money to find substitutes.
   China, India and other populous developing nations embarking on
mass production of consumer goods containing chlorofluorocarbons
reason that since the West invented and produces most of the
ozone-destroying chemicals, the West should pay to replace them.
   Despite the split, the 123 countries at an international
conference on the ozone layer agreed pressure is on scientists and
industry to find safe alternatives before more damage is done to the
fragile atmospheric shield.
   William Reilly, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
said the three-day conference that ended Tuesday sparked as much
public discussion as any international environmental issue since the
1985 Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union.
   ``We are all in this together,'' he said. ``We're all going to
have to find ways to collaborate in cleaning this mess up. It
affects us all.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, the conference host,
said all countries, including financially strapped Third World
nations, must do their part to save the ozone layer.
   ``It is not a case of some countries asking other countries to
act,'' she said. ``It is a case of every country taking action ...
No one can opt out.''
   Chlorofluorocarbons are widely used in aerosol propellants,
refrigerants, air conditioners, fast-food cartons and computer
solvents.
   They are stable and non-toxic when released into the atmosphere,
but 10 to 100 years later, when they rise 15-20 miles to the
stratosphere, their chemical bonds are broken apart. Scientists say
their chlorine atoms destroy ozone, allowing more of the sun's
ultraviolet rays to reach Earth, causing more skin cancer and eye
cataracts, and suppressing human immune systems.
   Related chemicals known as halons, used primarily in firefighting
equipment, cause the same damage, but are 10 times as efficient at
it.
   ``Even if all the chemicals which damage the ozone layer were
banned tomorrow, ozone depletion would continue for more than a
decade and it would take our planet something like 100 years to
replenish the ozone already lost,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, an Oxford
University-educated chemist.
   Chlorofluorocarbons also trap heat and warm global temperatures,
a process known as the ``Greenhouse Effect,'' which already is
thought to be responsible for climate changes.
   More than 1 million tons of the damaging substances are produced
annually, mostly by the United States.
   Several companies are working on substitutes, including the
American chemical firm Du Pont, which is the world's largest
manufacturer of chlorofluorocarbons, and Britain's Imperial Chemical
Industries. Some are working together to complete toxicity tests and
environmental assessments required by governments.
   Du Pont says it has ``candidate alternatives'' for all major
markets and hopes to market them by the mid-1990s. Reilly said
American carmakers told him they plan to use substitutes in
air-conditioning systems of their 1994 models.
   The United States and the 12-nation European Community have
promised to try to ban those chemicals by 1999 _ surpassing the
goals of the 1987 Montreal Protocol which requires they be halved by
the turn of the century.
   The protocol has been ratified by 33 countries. Another 20
countries told the conference they will sign up, and 14 are thinking
seriously about it, said Britain's Environment Secretary Nicholas
Ridley.
   Japan said it will consent to an international prohibition on
producing and using environmentally harmful chemicals, said Japanese
Environment Agency Director General Masahisa Aoki.
   ``If an agreement by each country regarding total abolishment can
be reached by the end of this century, Japan will agree to it,'' he
said.
   China and India, which have not signed the Montreal Protocol,
urged Western nations to create a new international fund to help
them acquire technologies to replace the chemicals.
   Prince Charles, long a defender of the environment, backed the
Third World countries' call.
   ``While we simply must eliminate CFCs ... we must not do so by
forcing developing nations to forego some of the benefits of
industrialization which developed countries have enjoyed for so
long,'' said the heir to the British throne.

   The city said Tuesday it is
turning one of Adolf Hitler's most ambitious building projects into
a museum documenting his popularity, horrors of the Holocaust and
other aspects of Nazism.
   The goal is to learn lessons from the past, said a city spokesman.
   Plans call for the museum to be located in a huge coliseum that
was to have been an imperial congress hall. But the Nazis never
finished the construction that began in 1937.
   ``We want to show how the Germans were actually fascinated by
Hitler,'' says Carlo Jahn, a historian in charge of the project.
   ``Hitler was at fault, but not the only one. Without the
fascination of the Germans for the Nazis, all the violence could not
have occurred,'' he said in an interview.
   More than 60 percent of Germans then thought they were better off
under Hitler, said Jahn.
   Nuremberg's leftist Social Democratic city council approved plans
for the museum Saturday.
   Costs have not yet been worked out, Jahn said, but he hoped they
would include permanent displays and salaried staff.
   ``We hope to set up an institute supported by the federal
government, Bavaria state, and public donations, because this is not
just the city's inheritance, it is national,'' the historian said.
   ``We want to eventually make the museum a full-time center of
studies about the phenomena of the Nazis, a combination museum and
research documentation center on those times.''
   He envisoned history experts using the center ``to study and
compare the results of totalitarian Nazi politics with other
political systems.''
   Nuremberg, about 125 miles northwest of Munich in Bavaria state,
was the site of the Nazi party's annual rallies.
   Jahn said Hitler chose Nuremberg because it was a traditional
government conference site before the Nazis took over, and ``Hitler
wanted to give the impression they had ties with tradition.''
   To further cement that impression, Hitler commissioned his chief
architect, Albert Speer, to construct the coliseum and a stadium to
hold 450,000 people at Nuremberg.
   The large stone facade of the incomplete building is located on
the outskirts of the city. The area was to be the site of columned
structures, stadiums and parks, inspired by architecture in ancient
Rome and Greece.
   Hitler wanted the complex to reflect the Nazis' interest in
architecture and to commemorate the Third Reich, which he boasted
would survive a thousand years. It ended in ruins in 1945 after 12
years.

<HEAD>Armenian Refugees Protest at Government Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 70 Armenians who fled the southern republic
of Azerbaijan because of ethnic violence massed in a government
office Tuesday to demand a meeting with Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov,
a dissident said.
   Sergei Grigoryants, a dissident journalist who is half Armenian
and half Russian, said the refugees wanted to talk to Ryzhkov about
what they see as government attempts to force them to return to
Azerbaijan.
   At least 141,000 Azerbaijanis have fled Armenia, and 159,000
Armenians left Azerbaijan, most of them since violence erupted in
the region in the Caucasus Mountains in November. The violence,
sparked by a territorial dispute between Armenians and Azerbaijanis,
has claimed 91 lives, the government says.
   Grigoryants said the government has been all but forcing the
Armenian refugees to return to Azerbaijan by evicting them from
hotels and not giving them permanent places to live or new jobs. The
refugees fear they will become targets of the ethnic hatred if they
return to Azerbaijan.
   The government contends the refugees would be safe if they
returned, and says it is trying to find new jobs and homes for those
who wish to stay away.
   A group of the refugees showed up Friday at the offices of the
Council of Ministers, the Soviet Cabinet, to demand a meeting with
Ryzhkov, Grigoryants said. An aide promised that Ryzhkov would meet
the refugees in a few days and try to help.
   On Monday, the refugees received word that Ryzhkov had refused a
meeting because the issue was resolved, so 70 of them returned to
the office Tuesday to protest, and seven announced a hunger strike,
according to the dissident.
   The predominantly Moslem Azerbaijanis and mostly Christian
Armenians have been at odds since February 1988 in a dispute over
the Nagorno-Karabakh district of Azerbaijan. Armenians, who make up
the majority of the district's population, complained of
discrimination under Azerbaijani control, and demanded annexation
with the Armenian republic. They have staged huge demonstrations and
strikes in Armenia.

<HEAD>Last Major Lending Organization For Peru Cuts Off Funding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peru on Tuesday confirmed its last major source
of development loans has cut off aid because the nation has fallen
more than six months behind in debt payments.
   One newspaper said the suspension in aid by the Inter-American
Development Bank closes ``the circle of Peru's international
financial isolation'' and accused President Alan Garcia of
converting Peru into a ``leper in the world of international
finance.''
   The suspension follows similar actions by the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank since 1986, a year after Garcia
announced he would limit debt payments to 10 percent of his nation's
exports.
   A spokesman for the Economy and Finance Ministry, speaking on
condition of anonymity, confirmed the validity of a copy of a telex
published in Tuesday's La Republica newspaper from the
Inter-American Development Bank to the Peruvian government.
   The telex, dated March 1, said the international lending agency
was suspending credit to Peru because it was more than 180 days
behind in debt payments, the maximum period allowed under the bank's
regulations.
   The World Bank has said Peru's foreign public and private debt
totals $19 billion. A ministry spokesman said Peru was $70 million
behind in payments.
   Garcia, who has accused the International Monetary Fund of being
a ``tool'' of foreign banks, said Sunday his government had stopped
paying the Inter-American Development Bank because the bank's
programmed loans to Peru are less than what Peru is scheduled to
repay on its old debt.
   He said his government's policy is to ``have a positive cash
flow'' from the lending agency.
   Government sources told The Associated Press that the bank had
rejected recent Peruvian requests for new development loans on the
grounds that the projects presented for approval were hastily
planned and did not meet technical requirements.
   Economy and Finance Minister Carlos Rivas Davila denied the
Inter-American Development Bank's suspension had isolated Peru from
international financial aid.
   ``The fact that there is no access for the moment to IDB's
resources does not mean that Peru is isolated from the international
financial system,'' he said. ``Our operations with the Andean
Reserve Fund, the Andean Development Corporation and government
agencies, among others, are normal.''
   But reports of the suspension brought criticism from the news
media and government opponents.
   ``The circle of Peru's international financial isolation has been
closed,'' Manuel d'Ornellas, one of the country's most respected
journalists, wrote in Tuesday's edition of Expreso.
   He accused Garcia of being responsible for converting Peru into
``leper in the the world of international finance.''
   When Garcia took office in 1985, he imposed a ceiling on debt
payments equal to 10 percent of the nation's export income. His
defiant stand was praised by many politicians in Latin America,
which as a region owes more than $400 billion to Western creditors.
   Garcia used the money to finance an economic recovery program,
but Peru ran out of dollar reserves a year ago and the economy has
entered its deepest recession of the century. Inflation reached a
record 1,722 percent last year.

   President Bush said Tuesday that he wants to
find a way to prevent criminal use of semiautomatic assault guns but
still ``do what's right by the legitimate sportsman.''
   The president, a lifetime member of the National Rifle
Association, said he directed William Bennett, his nominee for drug
policy coordinator, to look into what can be done about the
proliferation of semiautomatics on city streets.
   Although he said previously that he opposed banning such weapons,
Bush said Tuesday that he assigned Bennett to ``work the problem,''
and told him:
   ``I'm not so rigid that if you come to me with a sensible answer
that takes care of the concerns that I've felt over the years, I'll
take a hard look at it, and I'll work with you to that end.''
   Bush said he spoke to Bennett after the nominee was quoted as
taking a position opposite the president in saying he would consider
outlawing the weapons as a way to cut down on drug-related violence.
   The semiautomatic AK-47 guns have provoked increasing public
outcry with an escalating number of shootings involving gangs and
innocent bystanders.
   Bush said he wants to find ``what can be worked out with finality
on AK-47s ... and still do what's right by the legitimate sportsman.
I'd love to find an answer to that.''
   The NRA has been active in opposing any semiautomatic-ban efforts
on Capitol Hill on the grounds that such limits would also affect
hunting rifles.
   Asked what he would tell family members of those who were killed
and maimed by such weapons _ which inflict wounds doctors learned to
treat in the Vietnam War _ Bush said, ``I say the same thing I say
to a person whose family has been maimed by a pistol or an explosive
charge or whatever else it might be _ a fire _ this is bad, and we
have to stop the scourge of drugs.''
   But he added in terms of curbing semiautomatics, ``It isn't as
easy as it seems to those who are understandably crying out, `do
something. Do something.'''
   While Bush voiced concern about the terror waged by
semiautomatics, his comments coupled with his association with the
NRA left gun-control activists skeptical.
   ``He hasn't supported anything,'' such as a waiting period to buy
such guns instead of the current over-the-counter purchase, said
Stay Onders, public relations spokeswoman for the National Coalition
to Ban Handguns. ``I think he got some backlash from his original
statement,'' opposing a ban on semiautomatics, she added. ``I think
he's just trying to make himself seem a little moderate.''
   Efforts to outlaw semiautomatics have taken a higher profile
since mid-January when a gunman took a Chinese-made AK-47 into a
schoolyard in Stockton, Calif., and shot 35 people, including five
children who were fatally shot.
   Bush held his news conference on short notice after a winter
storm caused postponement of a planned trip to Pennsylvania and
Delaware that was to have focused on an anti-drug message.
   On Monday, Bush told a Veterans of Foreign Wars audience that
``the notion that America is a nation at peace is only partly true,
as long as the violence and destructive power of drugs assault our
communities.''
   He pledged to ``mobilize all our resources'' to combat drug abuse.
   Bush has asked Congress for $5.5 billion for the battle against
drugs, with much of the money going to law enforcement.

   Police on Tuesday detained more than 30
people protesting a crackdown on an earlier demonstration.
Authorities called for punishment for journalists they said are
trying to drive a wedge between ethnic Latvians and Russians.
   The developments were in line with the Communist Party's growing
intolerance toward a growing nationalist movement in Latvia and its
two neighboring republics on the Baltic Sea, Estonia and Lithuania.
   The Russian-language newspaper Sovietskaya Latvia published a
directive of the Latvian party's Central Committee accusing the
republic's state-run radio, television, newspapers and magazines of
``one-sidedness, bias, and jumping to conclusions that does not
weaken but heats up the situation.''
   It urged Communist Party organizations to punish party members in
the media who ignored an order in January to cool the atmosphere.
   Anticipating the crackdown, Latvian actors demonstrated Monday
outside Communist Party headquarters, and the official Tass news
agency said 26 were detained.
   Hundreds of Latvians gathered Tuesday evening at the Riga
headquarters of the Interior Ministry, which is in charge of the
police, to protest the detentions, said one of the demonstrators,
Boris Sokolov.
   In a telephone interview, Sokolov told The Associated Press in
Moscow that the demonstrators carried posters saying Monday's
detentions were illegal.
   Police moved in and ripped down one poster that called Interior
Ministry officials ``Today's Stalins,'' said Sokolov, a member of an
independent political group called the Democratic Union.
   Sokolov said he and 33 other demonstrators were detained.
   Tass quoted a government official as defending Monday's
detentions.
   ``Interior Minstry officers have nothing against meetings and
demonstrations, provided the organizers comply with the law,'' Tass
quoted Latvian Interior Minister Bruno Steinbrik as saying.
   But it said he added: ``This time, picketers' unsanctioned
actions hampered public transport. They were asked to disperse, but
some of the protesters started insulting militiamen.''
   Most of the 26 detained Monday were freed without charges, but
three will face administrative punishment, Tass said.
   The directive published in Sovietskaya Latvia did not give
specific examples of biased reporting. But journalists and Latvian
activists said the party leadership was upset by news coverage that
led to the adoption of limits on the immigration of non-Latvians
into the small republic, and by reports that some of the immigrants
were jumping queues for housing.
   The journalists also have covered protests on ethnic,
environmental and other sensitive issues.
   The newspaper did not specify how the journalists would be
punished.
   Of Latvia's 2.6 million inhabitants, 54 percent are Latvians, and
33 percent are ethnic Russians.
   Latvia, like the other Baltic republics of Lithuania and Estonia,
was absorbed by the Soviet Union in 1940, one year after a pact
between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany consigned the area to the
Kremlin's sphere of influence.
   In January, the Latvian Communist Party chief, Janis Vagris,
expressed alarm over rising tensions in the republic. He said the
party itself was feeling the effects of ``ethnic stratification.''
   Political ferment has increased markedly in the Baltic states
with the liberalized atmosphere fostered by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. Some residents now openly say they want to gain their
homelands' lost independence.

   A pregnant woman, her husband and their
2-year-old son were rescued after being stranded in the Kalahari
Desert for nine days, a relative said Tuesday.
   Jonathan Hayman, his wife, Laura, and their son, Romano, were
driving across the Central Kalahari Game Reserve on Feb. 23 when
their truck broke down, said Lawrence Wright, a cousin of Hayman.
   After three days, the Botswana family ran out of food and water
and began walking back toward their hometown of Serowe, more than
120 miles away, Wright said.
   The mother and child were too weak to continue after three days,
but Hayman, 24, continued and was found by farm workers Saturday.
   A Botswana Defense Force helicopter located Mrs. Hayman and her
son, Wright said.
   ``I had given up hope,'' said Mrs. Hayman, 23. ``I thought we
were both dead.''
   She said she and her son survived by sucking the moisture off
plants during the night. Daytime temperatures in the Kalahari Desert
often reach above 100 degrees time of year.

<HEAD>1988 Receipts Likely Up Slightly from 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher prices for last year's drought-reduced
vegetable harvests probably boosted growers' receipts slightly from
the record level of $9.2 billion in 1987, the Agriculture Department
said Tuesday.
   ``Total output of vegetables probably fell about 4 percent in
1988 because of declines in potato, dry bean and processing
vegetable production,'' the department's Economic Research Service
said in an outlook report. ``Assuming normal weather, output should
rebound in 1989.''
   While projecting higher overall income for vegetable farmers last
year, the department's report _ a summary of another report, not yet
released _ did not have a figure for projected 1988 income.
   The report released Tuesday also said that per capita use of
vegetables, which probably declined in 1988 because of smaller
production, is expected to return to pre-drought levels this year.
   ``Utilization probably will continue to be enhanced by general
economic conditions in the United States,'' the report said. ``With
real disposable incomes and employment remaining relatively strong,
domestic demand for all types of vegetables should continue robust.''
   Exports of fresh vegetables, which soared in 1988, are expected
to continue rising this year, reflecting the decline in the dollar
and growth in the Japanese market, the report said.
   One reason for the export increase is a rise in french fry
shipments to Pacific Rim countries.
   Potato prices paid to growers are projected to average even
higher than the department's initial forecast of $5.49 per
hundredweight, the report said. Last year's average was $4.35 per
100 pounds. As a result, potato farmers are expected to expand their
1989 acreage.

   Proposed delegates would be subject to Israel's approval, and the
government would reject any Palestinian affiliated in any way with
the Palestine Liberation Organization, said spokesman Yossi Ahimeir.
   ``With the help of Jordan and Egypt, and with good will, it will
be possible to choose a (Palestinian) delegation which will be a
temporary representational body until the beginning of autonomy,''
Ahimeir said in an interview.
   Shamir's proposal was made public as the issue of peace with
Palestinians caused increasing splits in the coalition Cabinet of
his right-wing Likud bloc and the left-leaning Labor Party.
   Some Labor Cabinet ministers have proposed talking to the PLO
under certain conditions. Others favor choosing Palestinian
negotiators by elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   But Shamir rejects both ideas, Ahimeir said, confirming Tuesday
newspaper reports.
   He said an interim autonomy plan granting Palestinians limited
autonomy should be established before elections. Palestinians could
then hold elections for an administrative council that would
negotiate a long-term solution, he said.
   Speaking to a visiting Socialist International delegation, Labor
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin raised the possibility of elections
Monday as a way to get around the impasse over the PLO, which Israel
considers a terror organization bent on destroying the Jewish state.
   ``With these political figures elected in the territories, we
will conduct negotiations concerning the interim period ... and
following a period of time we shall reach a discussion of the
permanent solution with Jordan representatives of the residents of
the territories,'' Rabin said Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of Labor said he supports
negotiations with any Palestinian who agrees to give up terror and
the claim that Palestinian refugees have the right to return to
abandoned homes in Israel, and accepts Israel's right to exist
within secure borders.
   A spokesman for Shahal said Tuesday that once conditions were met
``the PLO is no longer the PLO as we know it today.''
   Communications Minister Gad Yaacobi, also of Labor, was quoted by
the Jerusalem Post as saying PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat could be a
negotiating partner if he were elected by Palestinians in the
occupied territories.
   Yaacobi and Shahal added their voices to those of Labor's Ezer
Weizman and Motta Gur, both ministers without portfolio.
   Shamir described Shahal's proposal as ``jibberish'' at a news
conference Tuesday where he restated his refusal to negotiate with
the PLO.
   ``It is our determination not to talk to this body (the PLO)
because they are opposed to peace with us,'' Shamir said.

<HEAD>Pinochet Reported Planning Plebiscite to Amend Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FEDERICO QUILODRAN</BYLINE>

   President Augusto Pinochet plans to call a
plebiscite in the next three months to propose changes in the
military-drafted Constitution, a government official and a newspaper
said Tuesday.
   Changes to be ratified by a popular vote in May or June may
include one that allows Pinochet to seek re-election in a December
presidential vote, according to the El Diario newspaper.
   The newspaper quoted unidentifed government sources as saying
Pinochet is expected to announce the plebiscite Saturday as part of
his annual state-of-the nation address.
   When asked at a news conference Saturday about reports of a
second referendum, Pinochet said only, ``Everything is possible,''
and refused to elaborate.
   But Jaime Guzman, one of Pinochet's closest political allies,
said Tuesday: ``I have firm indications that the president will
announce a plebiscite to amend the constitution.''
   In October, voters rejected a proposal to extend Pinochet's term
until 1997 and set the Dec. 14 election date. The Constitution bars
Pinochet from running again.
   However, a number of right-wing groups have repeatedly asked that
the Constitution be changed to allow the 73-year-old president and
army commander to seek re-election.
   Last week, Pinochet refused to rule out a new presidential
candidacy.
   ``It's too early to talk about that,'' said Pinochet, who has
ruled since a bloody 1973 coup.
   The opposition has demanded constitutional changes since the
campaign for the October referendum. However, the specific changes
they want such as the elimination of one article that bars Marxist
parties and another that appoints one-third of the 35-member senate,
have been flatly rejected by Pinochet.
   Consequently, opposition leaders have shown little enthusiasm for
a second plebiscite.
   ``The only constitutional change we want is the one that restores
popular sovereignty,'' said Ricardo Lagos, who heads a moderate
socialist party.

<HEAD>Flag's Use in Artwork: Desecration, Celebration, Cause for Reflection?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEGGY ANDERSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American flag is still on the floor at the
School of the Art Institute despite a museum-goer's arrest, a
lawsuit, threats of economic reprisals and protests from veterans,
who vowed Tuesday to step up their opposition.
   ``I had 2,500 people here (Sunday) and I'm going to have 25,000
people here (protesting) next Sunday,'' said Republican state Sen.
Walter Dudycz, a Vietnam veteran.
   School officials haven't been swayed by the furor over a student
artwork featuring a flag spread on the ground.
   ``We feel .. that the First Amendment is at stake in a very big
way here,'' said Tony Brown, vice president of the school of 1,700,
which is affiliated with the Art Institute of Chicago, one of the
nation's most respected museums.
   ``You almost have a charge from the public, if you're going to be
a great institution to take a very serious look at freedom of
expression,'' he said.
   The work that caused the uproar is ``What is the Proper Way to
Display the U.S. Flag?'' by Scott Tyler, 24, of Chicago, who calls
himself ``Dread'' Scott.
   The exhibit consists of the flag; a photographic montage on the
wall with pictures of flag-draped caskets, South Koreans burning the
flag and a ``Yankees go home'' sign; and a ledger for comments on a
shelf below the photos.
   Veterans contend the work invites viewers to trample the flag as
they go to the ledger, and on Saturday, Susan Willhofft, an art
teacher from Arlington, Va., was charged with felony desecration of
the flag for stepping on it.
   Protests began a week after the exhibit opened Feb. 17 for a
five-week run.
   Veterans said they consider the flag's placement a desecration,
and they were joined by several politicians, including Republican
mayoral candidate Ed Vrdolyak.
   ``I personally shed a lot of blood defending the flag. ... We
defended it in Vietnam, we're going to defend it here in our city,''
said Robert Kolling, who lost a leg in Vietnam and was among the
throngs demonstrating Sunday.
   Dudycz and Vrdolyak urged a boycott of the school's corporate
sponsors and also said they would try to cut off state funds from
the institution.
   The school gets its money from federal, state and corporate
sources, said spokeswoman Beth Sullivan, but she said she did not
have exact figures.
   ``I'm getting phone calls from all over the country. People are
asking what they can do,'' Dudycz said Monday.
   Brown had no comment on the threat to cut off funds.
   The school closed the exhibit Feb. 25 after threats to students
and the building, but it was reopened on Friday.
   The same day, Circuit Judge Kenneth Gillis dismissed a lawsuit
from veterans seeking to take the flag off the floor. ``This exhibit
is as much an invitation to think about the flag as ... to step on
the flag,'' he said.
   Veterans of Foreign Wars spokesman Robert Jones said Tuesday his
group would abide by Gillis' ruling. But he said the VFW would
petition members of Congress and others to complain about the
desecration.
   Ms. Willhofft's attorney, David Steinberg, called her an
``innocent out-of-town tourist who was entrapped,'' and said the
Supreme Court has overturned three flag-desecration prosecutions
since 1969 and is considering a 1984 flag-burning that occurred
during the GOP National Convention.
   Another work at the school stirred controversy last spring when
black aldermen stormed the halls to remove a painting of the late
Harold Washington that depicted the city's first black mayor wearing
women's underwear.
   School officials have refused to disclose Tyler's whereabouts.
The works in the exhibit were selected by faculty members.

<TEXT>
   A group of 57 political prisoners at a
high-security prison have gone on a hunger strike to protest an
alleged beating by soldiers and demand a government investigation, a
lawyer said Tuesday.
   Ersan Sansal, a defense lawyer, said the inmates told him they
began the hunger strike March 1 after more than 100 special commando
soldiers entered the cell blocks and kicked and beat prisoners.
   The lawyer said one inmate was hospitalized with broken ribs and
that four others suffered concussions and were taken to the prison
infirmary.
   Hilmi Baykal, a prosecutor investigating the incident, confirmed
the prisoners were on a hunger strike but declined to give any other
details.
   Prison authorities also placed 19 inmates in isolation cells
after the incident, the lawyer said.
   Sansal said fasting inmates want a fair investigation of the
incident and the release of prisoners from isolation cells.
   The inmates are accused of belonging to leftist organizations
that were active before the 1980 military takeover. They are being
tried under accusations of trying to overthrow the government.

<HEAD>400,000 More Tons of Wheat Sold to China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private exporters have sold China an additional
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part of 2 million
tons authorized Feb. 27 for China under the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses
of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The latest sale boosted to more than 7.8 million tons the amount
of wheat sold to China for 1988-89 delivery under the EEP.
   Sims said the latest sales were handled by Cargill Inc., 150,000
tons; and Louis Dreyfus Corp., 250,000 tons.
   The wheat was sold for shipment in April and May and will carry
an average subsidy rate of $22.19 per ton, or about 60 cents a
bushel, he said. Slightly more than 1.6 million tons are still
available under the current authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 400,000 tons would be about 14.7 million bushels and,
at recent prices of about $4.1l per bushel, would have a farm value
of around $60 million.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday dismissed suggestions
that the fight to salvage John Tower's nomination as defense
secretary has paralyzed his administration.
   ``I think we're on track,'' Bush said in answer to a host of
recent stories depicting an administration in disarray and without
momentum.
   He ticked off a number of initiatives, such as foreign policy
talks with world leaders, saying, ``I would simply resist the clamor
that nothing seems to be bubbling around, that nothing is
happening.''
   Several political figures, including some Republicans, have said
they believe the long Tower confirmation battle has sapped White
House energy and held up other important business, such as key
decisions about national defense strategy and the appointments of
top-level government officials.
   But during a White House news conference, Bush said there were
``plenty of substantive things'' taking place in the seventh full
week of his presidency.
   ``If you would just write down all those wonderful things I told
you that are happening, and get it out to that wide readership,'' he
told reporters, ``it would be very helpful to me.''
   Although Bush said he wants to see the pace of nominations and
appointments move more quickly, he cited statistics he said show
more key nominations made at this juncture than were announced after
six weeks by the Reagan administration in 1981.
   David Gergen, a White House communications director during the
first two years of the Reagan administration and now editor at large
of U.S. News &amp; World Report, harshly criticized Bush in an article
written for the editorial section of Sunday's Washington Post.
   ``Win or lose on the Tower fight, President Bush now stands
perilously close to the edge of a cliff,'' Gergen wrote. `` ...
There is deepening sense in Washington that something is badly amiss
in his administration.''
   Asked about Gergen's criticism, Bush said, ``Well, I think he's
wrong.''
   Questioned about Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's statement
that Democrats in Congress should seize the national policy
initiative, Bush replied, ``Ted Kennedy? Enough said.''
   Bush conceded, however, that ``that's one of the allegations _
disarray.''
   But he said ``I don't think the American people make up their
minds on perceptions,'' and he said he has ``total confidence'' in
former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, White House chief of staff.
   ``Every chief of staff goes through this drill where he gets
saluted for his brilliance and, a month later, gets attacked for his
something else,'' Bush said.
   Bush defended time-consuming reviews he has ordered in areas of
foreign policy, strategic defense and Pentagon budget management,
saying ``it is a prudent thing to do.''
   He acknowledged that not having a secretary of defense in place
at the Pentagon was ``an inhibiting factor'' in getting the
strategic review completed in 90 days, but said ``I hope there's not
going to be any slippage'' in meeting the May 10 deadline. ``I don't
want to be foot-dragging.''
   Bush maintained he has provided Congress with more details on his
budget thinking than had either former presidents Ronald Reagan and
Jimmy Carter.
   He said moved quickly on the savings-and-loan crisis, that he is
pushing ahead with a reassessment of America's drug problem, with a
host of environmental initiatives and with a system of national
service for the young.
   ``Go back and look at history,'' Bush urged reporters. ``It kind
of goes in cycles. But I'm not deterred at all.''

   ``Today'' show regulars Bryant Gumbel and Willard
Scott patched things up publicly Tuesday _ sort of _ with the folksy
weatherman trying to lead his severest critic in an oath on computer
memo writing.
   Scott had threatened to leave if Gumbel did not apologize for
saying in an in-house memo to the producer that the weatherman was
killing the show with ``his assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays
and bad taste.''
   Their first effort to make up occurred Monday, but a technical
problem with the telephone and a video link prevented the two from
completing an on-air conversation.
   Tuesday morning, they tried again, and this time the hookup
worked.
   After some banter about the previous day's snags _ ``I hung up on
you,'' Scott joked _ they got down to business.
   Scott told Gumbel to raise his right hand and repeat after him:
   Gumbel raised his left hand.
   Scott: ``I, Bryant Gumbel...''
   Gumbel: ``I, Bryant Gumbel...''
   Scott: ``...will promise...''
   Gumbel: ``...will promise...''
   Scott: ``...to never write another memo and leave it in the
computer again.''
   Gumbel: ``...but I can't write in longhand.''
   The session concluded with Gumbel and co-host Jane Pauley wishing
Scott, who turned 55 on Tuesday, a happy birthday and a good
vacation. Scott, surrounded by a crowd of cheering fans, appeared
happy. But then, he always does.

   At least 500 soldiers, including
colonels and generals, are under investigation for corruption as
part of the military's attempt to cleanse its image, according to
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos.
   The list included 140 officers with the rank of colonel or above,
Ramos said after a Senate hearing Monday. Most of the alleged
offenses took place under Ferdinand Marcos' administration, he said.
   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said most senior officers
under investigation have retired. But he said those in active
service include Lt. Gen. Antonio Sotelo, the vice chief of staff.
   Documents released by the Anti-Graft Board of the Armed Forces of
the Philippines showed 744 people were charged with graft, including
580 soldiers, 19 police officers and 145 civilians working in
military agencies. They showed 146 military officials have been
cleared of graft charges.
   Ramos also said the military is to implement major changes in the
armed forces, but he denied it was connected with the investigation
of graft charges.

   Israeli troops Tuesday shot and
killed a Palestinian who ignored orders to halt. U.N. officials said
baton-wielding troops clubbed 25 people in a Gaza Strip clinic.
   The incidents occurred during widespread clashes between
stone-throwing Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops in the
occupied territories after the deaths of three Palestinians on
Monday.
   In addition to the reported beatings Tuesday, at least 34
Palestinians were shot and wounded, most in the occupied Gaza Strip,
Arab hospital officials said. Ten of the gunshot wounds were
reported in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, where the medical clinic
was raided.
   Army spokesmen confirmed the latest death and six of the
injuries, adding other reports were being investigated.
   Also Tuesday, the army blew up the houses in Nablus of two
Palestinians accused of killing a soldier last month. Paratrooper
Benny Meisner died Feb. 24 when a building block was dropped on his
head from the roof of a house.
   Israel radio carried the sound of the explosions, and jeering and
whistling by protesting Palestinians could be heard in the
background. Israel television said the two suspects confessed to the
killing.
   In another development, Israeli newspapers reported Tuesday that
the army detained five soldiers suspected of extoring tens of
thousands of dollars from Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The reports said the soldiers allegedly held Palestinians at
gunpoint while they frisked the men and searched their homes, taking
tens of thousands of dollars, Israeli shekels and Jordanian dinars.
   The military command said it was checking the reports.
   In Nablus' market, 18-year-old Hakam Baker was fatally shot in
the neck and back by soldiers, hospital officials said.
   An army spokesman, who cannot be identified by name under
military rules, said Baker fled from an army patrol, ignoring orders
to halt and warning shots fired in the air. He said the man had a
record of anti-Israeli activities and was wanted on unspecified
charges.
   Baker was the 391st Palestinian to be killed since the uprising
against Israeli rule in the territories erupted in December 1987.
Seventeen Israelis also have died, six of them soldiers.
   The fatal shooting occurred as the army conducted a major
security sweep in the narrow, winding alleys of Nablus' market,
which has been a center of unrest.
   The city of 120,000 people, the West Bank's largest, was put
under curfew, which restricts people to their homes. Troops with
automatic rifles stood guard atop buildings along the main road into
the city.
   In the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian doctor said soldiers and border
police barged into a medical clinic run by the U.N. Relief and Works
Agency in the Jabaliya refugee camp. UNRWA supervises aid programs
for Palestinian refugees.
   The physician at the clinic, who identified himself only as Dr.
Ahmed, told The Associated Press by telephone: ``We treated 45 cases
of beatings, regular bullets, rubber bullets, and there were
hundreds of relatives gathered in front of the clinic.''
   Some of the relatives threw stones at soldiers, who chased
Palestinians into the clinic, the doctor said.
   Inside, the soldiers beat 25 people with nightsticks and broke
all the windows, a microscope, a telephone and some syringes, he
said.
   ``They beat some of the injured people we were treating,'' Dr.
Ahmed said, adding three beating victims suffered factured skulls
and were sent to a hospital.
   An army spokesman said more than 1,000 people had gathered
outside the clinic in Jabaliya and that preliminary reports
indicated some Palestinians were wounded by soldiers.
   But he was unable to give a specific number or any details
concerning the actions of the soldiers inside the clinic. A radio
report said several people were arrested, including one UNRWA worker.
   Doctors at Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City said they treated 37
Palestinians for beating injuries, including some from Jabaliya.
Among the wounded was a 2-year-old girl who suffered a broken leg in
a clash with soldiers.
   Among the deaths that spurred Tuesday's unrest was that of
Mahmoud Yousef Masri, 32, who died in a Gaza prison after several
days of intensive questioning.
   An autopsy conducted by the prison authority revealed that Masri
died of natural causes and was not physically abused, Israel
television reported.
   The television said Masri had an ulcer condition and died in the
corridor of the prison, not the interrogation room as had been
alleged.
   Justice Minister Dan Meridor told army radio Tuesday that he had
heard no claims of torture in the case, but the death was being
investigated.

<HEAD>Agency Says Steel Rails from Canada Being Sold Below Fair-Market
Value</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday it has
made a preliminary determination that steel rails from Canada are
being sold in the United States at less than fair-market value.
   In an investigation that began last September with a petition
from Bethlehem Steel Corp. on behalf of the U.S. steel industry, the
department found dumping of rails by Algoma Steel Corp. Ltd. and
other unspecified companies in Canada.
   The department is expected to make a final ruling by May 22. If
the agency's initial determination stands, the U.S. International
Trade Commission would decide within 45 days whether the imports
threaten injury to the U.S. steel industry.
   If the ITC finds that imports with an unfair price advantage over
comparable domestic products are harming U.S. industry, anti-dumping
duties are imposed.
   Imports of steel rails from Canada in 1987 were valued at about
$10 million. The rails are used in the railroad industry, rapid
transit lines, subways and mines.

<HEAD>Massive Flare from Sun Disrupts Communications, May Affect Satellites</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another high-intensity flare spewed from the
sun Tuesday, but federal officials said it was not as massive as an
eruption Monday that interfered with a radio navigation system and
some communications.
   Forecaster Mike Abbott at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's Space Environment Services Center in Boulder, Colo.
said the new flare was classed as an X-1, far weaker than the
earlier one but ``still pretty significant.''
   Solar flares are massive eruptions that burst suddenly from the
face of the sun. The eruptions send waves of electromagnetic
radiation and charged particles out into space. These waves can
disrupt communications on Earth and trigger brilliant displays of
the aurora, or polar lights.
   Abbott said Monday's flare overpowered instruments aboard NOAA
satellites that are able to measure solar intensity only up to what
is called X-12. Initially, experts estimated the flare at an X-20,
but that has been revised.
   ``A more thorough review of the data came up with an estimate of
about X-15,'' said Abbott. ``That's still an exceptional flare'' and
is the most powerful since April 1984.
   A powerful burst of X-rays and ultraviolet radiation, which
crosses the 92 million miles between Earth and the sun in just eight
minutes, was detected about 9:05 a.m. EST Monday. It disrupted a
Coast Guard Loran navigation system and some short wave radio
communications, officials said.
   At the Goddard Space Center, which monitors the Solar Max
Satellite for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
officials reported that a stream of radiation from Monday's solar
flare briefly overpowered the satellite instruments.
   ``The satellite (Solar Max) was stunned for about a minute and
then recovered,'' said Carolynne White, a NASA spokeswoman. The
Solar Max satellite focuses instruments on the sun to gather data
for scientists.
   Monday's flare may have created a storm of geomagnetic energy
that could impact the Earth sometime late Tuesday or early Wednesday
morning, said Abbott. He said the storm is expected to be ``major to
severe'' in the latitudes near both of the Earth's poles, and
``minor'' in the mid-latitudes. The storm could last for two to
three days, Abbott said.
   ``Major to severe'' geomagnetic storms can block some radio and
navigation communications between aircraft and ground stations, and
can interfere with some long distance telephone service by
generating an electrical charge along cables.
   The areas of Earth apt to be most affected by the major to severe
storm, he said, are those above 65 degrees latitude. This would
include much of Alaska, Canada, and Greenland, and the far northern
parts of Asia and Europe. South of the equator, only Antarctica is
above 65 degrees.
   Geomagnetic storms also create spectacular natural light shows by
energizing the Earth's magnetic fields over the north and south
poles. This creates the aurora, known north of the equator as the
Northern Lights.
   Radiation from solar flares also can affect orbiting satellites,
but Ms. White said there were no reports at Goddard of any
instrument problems from solar radiation. Goddard monitors up to 21
satellites for NASA.
   Bursts of solar radiation can affect satellite orbits by causing
the Earth's atmosphere to heat and expand slightly. This can put
molecules of atmospheric gases into contact with satellites in low
orbits and cause the craft to slow slightly and drop lower.
   More solar flares may occur at any time during the next 10 to 11
days, NOAA forecasters said.
   Abbott said the solar flares erupted from a region on the sun
that just rotated into view from the Earth on Monday. The area,
marked by sun spots, will take about 11 more days to move across the
face of solar sphere as the sun rotates.
   ``The probability of there being more solar flares is high,''
said Abbott. The fact that two flares occurred in the sun spot
region indicates that it is very active and apt to spawn more
eruptions, he said.
   The sun goes through phases of intense activity. It passed a low
point in 1986 and is now climbing toward an expected peak in
intensity later this year or early in 1990.
   A flare occurs when energy stored by the sun's magnetic fields
suddenly becomes unstable and is converted to geomagnetic radiation
within a few minutes.
   NOAA said solar telescopes recorded the flare of as a tongue
flamelike particles rising some 70,000 miles from the surface of the
sun.

<HEAD>Budget-Caused Cutbacks Will Cost Eventually, Patrick Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick told a House panel
Tuesday that budget-caused cutbacks in staff and computer equipment
this year could cost the Treasury $48 million in future revenues.
   Patrick said the Federal Communications Commission needs
additional funds in fiscal 1990 to hire more staff and buy more
computers to relieve a backlog of license and telecommunications
service applications that increased about 20 percent from 1988 to
1989.
   ``Delays in licensing caused by staff shortages or lack of
automatiion affect not only applicants, but adversely impact the
(gross national product) and reduce tax revenues,'' Patrick told the
House Appropriations subcommittee on commerce, justice and state,
the judiciary and related agencies.
   The subcommittee is considering the White House Office of
Management and Budget's request for $109.8 million in funds for the
FCC for fiscal 1990. That would be an increase of $10.2 million over
the fiscal 1989 appropriation of $99.6 million. The FCC had sought
$111.9 million.
   Patrick said the FCC's appropriation in fiscal 1988 was the same
as fiscal 1989 and that the agency began fiscal 1989 on Oct. 1,
1988, with a $5 million deficit because of pay raises and health
benefit increases.
   To cover that shortage, Patrick said he imposed a hiring freeze
and did not replace workers who retired or quit. Other cuts included
a 75 percent reduction in automated data processing equipment
purchases, he said.
   He said his staff estimated that a one-year reduction of $5
million in its fiscal 1989 appropriation, if continued beyond fiscal
1990, could reduce the present value of federal tax revenues by
roughly $53 million, producing a net revenue loss of about $48
million.
   Rep. Joseph D. Early, D-Mass., criticized the cutback in
automated equipment purchases.
   ``I don't think that's good management,'' he told Patrick.
   But Patrick said the agency had gotten to the point it couldn't
cut staff any further. He said in the first quarter of fiscal 1988
the agency had a backlog of 10,322 applications for new services in
the telephone industry. By the first quarter of fiscal 1989 the
backlog had grown to 12,317 applications or a 19 percent increase.
The backlog in radio applications was 20 percent, he said.

<HEAD>Crowds Drawn By Wonder of Partial Solar Eclipse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solar telescopes yielded views of
flare-producing sunspots and silhouetted mountains on the moon
Tuesday as crowds gathered to watch a partial solar eclipse visible
across western North America.
   ``There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,'' said
Ed Krupp, director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, where 600
children and at least 400 other people watched the moon block out 37
percent of the sun's surface at 10:50 a.m. PST.
   ``It was certainly a lively crowd,'' he said. ``There was a
festival atmosphere.''
   ``It's kind of neat,'' said map maker Jan Mayne, who was among
dozens of people watching the eclipse through two types of solar
telescopes at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial
eclipse, those watching through Caltech's telescopes could see
mountains on the edge of the moon silhouetted against the sun. Also
visible were gas jets on the sun's surface and a giant group of
sunspots that on Monday produced the most intense solar flare _ a
burst of heat and radiation _ since 1984.
   ``There was a stunning view of that large sunspot group,'' Krupp
said.
   The eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a
diagonal line stretching roughly from Mazatlan, Mexico, northeast to
Dallas and Chicago.
   Views were best farther west and north. But because the eclipse
was partial most people didn't notice the slight dimming of sunlight.
   ``You can't tell the difference between a partial eclipse and a
second-stage smog alert,'' joked one observer at Caltech.
   Several people viewed the eclipse through welder's helmets in
downtown Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of
the sun at 9:13 a.m. AST.
   In San Francisco, the moon eclipsed 46 percent of the sun at 9:52
a.m., but the event wasn't visible because of clouds that were so
thick they delayed arriving flights at the airport.
   A slight dimming was noticed in Seattle, where partly cloudy
skies allowed a glimpse of the 56 percent eclipse at 10:10 a.m. PST.
   The percentage of the sun blocked out and time of maximum eclipse
at other locations included 52 percent at 11:28 a.m. MST in
Edmonton, Alberta; 46 percent at 11:09 a.m. MST in Boise, Idaho; 36
percent at 11:10 a.m. MST in Salt Lake City; 35 percent at 9:58 a.m.
PST in Las Vegas; 25 percent at 11:17 a.m. MST in Denver; 15 percent
at 12:42 p.m. CST in Minneapolis, and a measly 3 percent at 12:44
p.m. CST in Milwaukee.
   Fearful that people would suffer eye damage during the eclipse,
scientists warned against staring at the sun directly or through
inadequate filters, including smoked glass and photographic film or
filters.
   Alan MacRobert, spokesman for Sky &amp; Telescope magazine, said
there were 245 known eye injuries in the United States after an
eclipse in 1970, but warnings about the danger reduced the number to
three during a 1984 partial eclipse.
   From any single spot on Earth, a partial eclipse occurs every
several years, said Ken Libbrecht, as assistant professor of
astrophysics at Caltech.
   Total solar eclipses are visible from any single location roughly
once every four centuries, though they are visible about every two
years from somewhere on Earth, he said.
   The next total eclipse will happen July 11, 1991, sweeping across
Hawaii, the Pacific Ocean, lower Baja California in Mexico, the west
coast of Central America and finally Colombia and Brazil, MacRobert
said.

<TEXT>
   NBC won the ratings for the 37th week in a
row, but which network is second for the season depends on whose
compilation of the Nielsen ratings you use.
   All three networks agree that ABC and CBS tied for second place
for the week ended March 5. But, with the season due to end April
23, the networks disagree on second place for the season-to-date.
NBC's wins go back to last season.
   NBC was the unquestioned winner for the week ended March 5 with a
16.1 rating and a share of 26 in the A.C. Nielsen Co. listing.
   ABC and CBS tied for the past week with 12.6 and a 20 share. Each
ratings point represents 904,000 homes with television. The share is
a percentage of the sets in use.
   The past week offered no surprises in the listings, with NBC's
``The Cosby Show'' still in first place. ABC's ``The Wonder Years''
was in eighth place after its move to Tuesday night between ``Who's
the Boss?'' in seventh place, and ``Roseanne,'' in third place.
   NBC, which lists the beginning of the season as Sept. 19, put ABC
in second place after 24 weeks. Its season-to-date ratings are ABC
12.9 with a 21 percent share and CBS 12.6 with a 20 share. NBC leads
season-to-date with a rating of 16.0 and a 26 share.
   CBS, counting the season from Oct. 24, lists itself in second
place with a 12.9 rating and a 21 share. It gives ABC 12.8 and a 21
share.
   ABC's Nielsen listings put ABC and CBS in a tie with 12.8 each.
It also counts the season from Oct. 24.
   The difference in the season beginning is due to the writers
strike last summer, which caused a delay in the premieres of many
series.
   NBC set the season opening at the traditional start time because
it had the Summer Olympics from Seoul, Korea. Differences may also
result from interpretations by the networks of the raw data from
Nielsen.
   It appeared that ABC would finish in second place for the second
year, but CBS became a contender with the miniseries ``Lonesome
Dove.''
   The Top 10 this past week was dominated by two nights, NBC's
Thursday comedies and ABC's Tuesday comedies. All four NBC Thursday
shows were at the top, as were three ABC shows.
   ABC's new comedy ``Coach,'' which had a special preview following
``Roseanne'' on Tuesday, placed 11th. But for its premiere in its
regular Wednesday time slot the show dropped to 46th place.
   Here are the Top 10: NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``A
Different World,'' ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``Cheers,'' NBC's
``Golden Girls,'' ABC's ``Who's the Boss?,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,''
ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and NBC's ``Dear
John.''
   The CBS special movie ``Day One'' was 29th in the ratings. The
premiere of the CBS series ``Hard Time on Planet Earth'' was in 65th
place.
   ``Married ... With Children,'' the Fox Broadcasting Co. comedy
that came under attack last week from a Michigan mother who said the
show was ``lewd and anti-family,'' was 54th.
   The lowest-rated show of the week was Fox's ``Beyond Tomorrow.''
Here are the four other lowest shows of the week: Fox's ``The
Reporters,'' Fox's ``The Tracey Ullman Show,'' ABC's ``a Fine
Romance'' and Fox's ``Duet.''
   ABC said ``A Fine Romance'' had its last telecast last week and
would be replaced temporarily by a two-part movie special.
   Among the evening news shows, CBS was the winner with a rating of
11.5. ABC was second with 11.2 and NBC was third with 10.5.

<HEAD>GAO Backs Plan to Recover Costs from Estates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal and state governments could save as
much as $500 million a year if efforts were made to recover some of
the costs of nursing home care from the estates of Medicaid
recipients and their spouses, a congressional report said Tuesday.
   The report by the General Accounting Office recommends that
Congress require states to establish asset-recovery programs similar
to one run by the state of Oregon, which recovers about $10 for
every $1 spent on its Medicaid program.
   ``If implemented carefully, estate recovery programs can achieve
savings, while treating the elderly equitably and humanely,'' the
report said.
   However, ``it's a sensitive issue whenever you talk about
someone's right to leave an inheritance,'' said Jim Linz, assistant
director of Medicare and Medicaid issues for the GAO.
   Linz estimated total federal and state Medicaid savings at $400
million to $500 million if all states had an estate recovery program
such as Oregon's.
   Medicaid is a more than $50 billion federal-state health
assistance program for the poor. The federal government sets broad
guidelines for the programs and provides the bulk of the money, but
the states set eligibilty criteria and administer the programs.
   Most of the elderly who become eligible for Medicaid's nursing
home benefit do so by ``spending down'' their assets to meet the
income and asset limits for the program, the GAO said. However, the
program allows a Medicaid recipient to retain his home _ usually a
person's primary asset _ as long as a family member is living there
or the recipient expects to return to the home.
   Unless a state has an estate recovery program, however, it cannot
recover assets that remain at the time the recipient dies, or if
their spouse is living, at the time the spouse dies, the GAO said.
Often, the only remaining asset is the recipient's home.
   Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have programs
allowing recovery of Medicaid benefits from recipients estates, with
annual recoveries totaling about $42 million, according to a June
report by the inspector general for the Department of Health and
Human Resources.
   None of the programs approaches the effectiveness of the Oregon
program, which recovers an average of $327 per Medicaid nursing home
resident, which totals about $4 million annually, the GAO said. The
next highest recovery rates are $160 per Medicaid nursing home
resident in New Hampshire and $109 in Massachusetts.
   The key elements of Oregon's program, according to the GAO, are
procedures for identifying a Medicaid applicant's assets, tracking
and preserving assets while Medicaid assistance is provided, and
recovering from the recipient's estate. The law also allows for
recovery from the spouse's estate if the state didn't recover from
the recipient's estate.
   The GAO said advocacy groups for the elderly in Oregon say that
the state's program incorporates enough flexibility so that estate
recoveries don't create undue hardships on the recipient's heirs.

   Twenty-five years after the slayings of
three young men drew the nation's attention to the civil rights
movement, a new Freedom Summer caravan is being planned to
commemorate the deaths, organizers said Tuesday.
   Civil rights leaders from Mississippi and across the nation were
joined by Gov. Ray Mabus at the announcement of the caravan, which
will leave Philadelphia, Miss., on June 21 and travel to Washington
and New York.
   ``It will be kind of a prayer pilgrimage of reconcilation where
the spirit of good will which Mississippi has recaptured will come
alive again,'' said James Farmer, the former chairman of the
Congress of Racial Equality.
   Farmer, who played a major role in the original Freedom Summer
demonstrations in 1964, said Mississippi has shed its ``ugly image
of hatred'' and can be a model for the rest of the nation.
   He said he realized that when he Mabus greeted him in the
governor's office once held by the late Theodore Bilbo, a strident
segregationist.
   ``I knew then that in this great land of ours, all things are
possible,'' Farmer said.
   Mabus also spoke of change in Mississippi. ``Today, once more,
the officials of Mississippi are standing in the schoolhouse door,
but this time we are standing in that door to open it wider and to
make sure that everybody gets in,'' he said.
   The caravan will commemorate the slayings of Andrew Goodman,
James Earl Chaney and Michael Henry Schwerner, whose bodies were
found in an earthen dam near Philadelphia six weeks after their
deaths on June 21, 1964.
   Chaney was a 21-year-old black from Meridian; Goodman, 20, and
Schwerner, 24, were white New Yorkers who were among the young
people from around the nation who flocked to the South to protest
racial discrimination during Freedom Summer.
   Julia Chaney Moss, the sister of James Chaney, said the caravan
would ``recreate that moment in time in 1964 to educate the youth
and re-educate those older of us who maybe have become complacent in
our lives, and to re-dedicate ourselves to human rights, civil
rights and voter registration.''
   State Rep. Aaron Henry, president of the Mississippi branch of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said
the caravan would begin with rallies in Jackson and Meridian and
then head on to Philadelphia.
   Later stops are planned in Selma, Ala.; Washington, and New York,
where a rally will be held on June 24 near where Chaney is buried.
   Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner vanished after being arrested and
jailed in Philadelphia on a traffic violation. No one was tried for
murder, but eight men were convicted on federal charges of denying
the three their civil rights.
   The incident was fictionalized in the Oscar-nominated movie
``Mississippi Burning,'' which has won critical acclaim but also has
been widely accused of minimizing the role of black Mississippians.

   New Warsaw Pact proposals to eliminate
short-range nuclear weapons in Europe drew a split response on
Tuesday, indicating NATO could face a long battle over modernizing
those weapons in West Germany.
   On Monday, NATO and the Warsaw Pact outlined proposals for new
talks opening Thursday on reducing conventional arms and forces from
the Atlantic to the Ural mountains in the Soviet Union.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization focused on drastic
numerical reductions in Soviet tanks and artillery. Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze proposed deep cuts in troops and all
kinds of weaponry, including combat aircraft and battlefield nuclear
rockets.
   Shevardnadze also proposed new talks on the tactical nuclear
weapons, which have a 300-mile range, preceded by moves to withdraw
them from large parts of West Germany, East Germany and
Czechoslovakia.
   Western officials said his proposals seemed aimed at West
Germany, where there is increasing reluctance to go along with
American demands for immediate modernization of aging U.S.
battlefield nuclear rockets.
   West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, did not
mention Shevardnadze's proposal in his speech Tuesday to a 35-nation
foreign ministers' conference that precedes the formal opening of
the new talks Thursday.
   Genscher also failed to mention the need to keep a nuclear
deterrence in the NATO arsenal, ranged against what the West says
are far larger Warsaw Pact land forces in Europe.
   By contrast, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas termed nuclear
weapons an ``irreplaceable'' deterrent.
   ``The maintenance of credible defenses, the modernization of this
or that weapon is necessary,'' Dumas said Tuesday.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe also said a nuclear
deterrent is needed when he laid out NATO's proposals on Monday.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III held his first talks
Tuesday with Shevardnadze, agreeing to go to Moscow in early May to
fix a possible summit and resumption of talks to reduce long-range
nuclear missiles.
   Both men said later their meeting took place in a good atmosphere.
   But Baker took issue with Shevardnadze's proposals for talks to
eliminate battlefield nuclear missiles, noting that these were
specifically excluded from the mandate for the new talks.
   A U.S. official suggested on Monday that Shevardnadze's proposal
was meant to see if Moscow could open up fissures in the alliance.
   The United States made its own appeal to West German opinion
Monday by announcing it will explore ways for speeding the
withdrawal of chemical weapons due out by 1992.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who has irritated the
Americans by asking for a two-year delay on modernizing short-range
nuclear missiles, hailed the move and on Tuesday urged the Soviet
Union to destroy its chemical arms in East Europe.
   Genscher lined up behind the alliance proposals for the new
talks, but signaled he feels East and West should cooperate on
disarmament.
   He said West Germany and Poland will act as joint hosts in June
to a conference of military experts from NATO, the Warsaw Pact and
neutral European nations to work on criteria for turning the
military might massed in Europe into purely defensive forces.
   After meeting Baker, Shevardnadze noted the differences between
his proposals and NATO's, but added:
   ``Negotiation is negotiation. It is a complex process and I
believe that in this process we will be able to find mutually
acceptable decisions.''
   West European newspaper commentators welcomed the new efforts to
start dismantling military forces on the world's most heavily armed
continent.
   The liberal British newspaper, the Guardian, suggested, however,
that NATO was upstaged by the Soviets and questioned whether
alliance nations had yet ``begun to leave behind the Cold War
atmosphere.''
   ``If the dynamism of the Soviet side is not recognized and _
critically but positively _ matched by the West, that is a true
failure of imagination,'' it said.
   The Belgian newspaper, La Libre Belgique, said it sees little
common ground between NATO and Warsaw Pact positions and wondered
whether the talks will fail as earlier negotiations to reduce tanks
and troops in central Europe did.
   But other commentators and Western officials expressed optimism
because of new Soviet willingness to disarm.

<TEXT>
   The Senate voted 99-0 on Tuesday to confirm
career diplomat Thomas Pickering to be U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.
   Pickering, who will succeed retired Army Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters,
most recently served as U.S. ambassador to Israel.
   During his 30-year career as a Foreign Service officer he also
has been ambassador to Jordan, Nigeria and El Salvador.
   No opposition to the nomination was voiced during a brief debate
on the Senate floor, and senators of both parties hailed Pickering
as an experienced and talented diplomat.
   Several said that he begins his duties at the U.N. with
opportunities for breakthroughs in settling conflicts in many parts
of the world.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the senior GOP member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said Pickering will confront
anti-American, anti-Israeli and pro-Soviet attitudes from many U.N.
members.
   ``He is wading into a real quagmire ... of anti-American and
pro-communist bias,'' Helms said.
   In the roll call, only Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., did not vote.
   No mention was made in the brief Senate debate of the controversy
that developed when, during his service as ambassador to El
Salvador, Pickering accepted a private document from a Central
American official and delivered it to Oliver North, then a staff
member of the National Security Council.
   The document _ apparently later delivered by North to leaders of
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua _ was an offer to provide $1 million
in military equipment.
   During his confirmation hearing Pickering said that although he
delivered the letter to North, he did not believe he had violated a
congressional ban in effect at the time which barred direct or
indirect aid to the Contras.
   He said he delivered the letter to North outside of normal State
Department channels only because he knew North was the Reagan
administration's liaison with the Contras.

   The government and the opposition have
overcome barriers to a compromise, and an accord on political and
social reforms should be signed April 3, Lech Walesa said Tuesday.
   ``I am very satisfied,'' the founder of Solidarity said after an
eight-hour meeting with the interior minister, Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak, and other government and Communist Party officials.
   Opposition spokesmen said agreement was reached on legalizing the
banned Independent Students Association, known by its initials NZS,
which had become a sticking point in the month-old ``round table''
negotiations.
   The news came on the eve of the anniversary of student riots
March 8, 1968. On Tuesday, city officials in Warsaw took the unusual
step of issuing permits for two commemorative marches by students.
   ``We are finalizing the round table,'' Walesa said. ``All basic
problems, like (union) pluralism ... will be achieved in time, in
line with our commitments.''
   Authorities proposed negotiations with the opposition, led by
Walesa's union, because of strikes in 1988 and fears of further
social problems due to shortages, low wages and inflation running at
an annual rate of about 60 percent.
   Among the goals Walesa and other opposition leaders set were
restoration of legal status to Solidarity, the independent farmers'
union Rural Solidarity and the student association.
   All were formed in the labor turmoil of 1980, when Solidarity
became the first free union in the Soviet bloc. They were outlawed
after martial law was imposed in December 1981 but have continued to
function.
   Officials indicated soon after the talks began Feb. 6 that
Solidarity and Rural Solidarity would be legalized, but the student
group's fate remained in doubt.
   A joint communique carried by the official news agency PAP after
Tuesday's meeting said ``there were conditions for a further
rapprochement of stances on the key issues of dialogue and
directions of proposed political, economic and social reforms,
including the registration of the NZS student union.''
   Piotr Konopka, a Solicarity spokesman, said: ``It seems that this
is an unequivocal decision on registration of NZS. This is good news
for the students, but it's also good news for us because all the
people taking part in the talks on our side have emphasized that
registering NZS was one of the key problems.''
   No other agreements were mentioned in the joint statement. It
also said nothing of such issues as the form for parliamentary
elections in which the opposition would participate and an
opposition demand that wages be indexed to the cost of living.
   Walesa said he and Kiszczak might have to meet again but the
working groups on specific topics should finish by March 20. The
period between then and April 3 would allow each side to study the
tentative agreement, he said.
   About his meeting with Kiszczak, who leads the government
delegation, Walesa said: ``We are removing obstacles that have
appeared here and there, but we are only removing them politically
and the rest must be worked out at the tables because the experts
are there.''
   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, national spokesman for Solidarity, said: ``I
imagine the final agreement will be in the form of a resolution
including general declarations, maybe accompanied by annexes with
details, signed by all the participants at the round table.''
   Walesa spoke to reporters outside the Roman Catholic episcopate
in Warsaw after returning from the meeting accompanied by advisers.
He boarded a train soon afterward for Gdansk, the Baltic port where
he works as a shipyard electrician and founded Solidarity during a
strike in August 1980.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the Walesa-Kiszczak meeting
included ``attempts to separate out subjects on which we can reach
agreement in order to leave for the future subjects on which we
haven't reached agreement.''
   At a news conference, he listed requirements for an accord as
``working out a document about what links Poles, an agreement on
non-confrontational elections and practical implementation of trade
union pluralism.''

<HEAD>Subcommittee Approves Uniform Poll Closing Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee approved legislation
Tuesday to impose a uniform closing time for polls across the 48
contiguous states.
   The elections subcommittee of the House Administration Committee
approved the measure on a voice vote. Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash. and the
subcommittee chairman, said he expected Congress will approve the
bill this year.
   The measure, similar to ones twice approved by the House, now
goes to the full committee.
   Election officials in the West have complained that voters in
their states sometimes decide not to vote when the winner of a
presidential election is known before their polls close and that the
drop in turnout has affected the outcome of close local races.
   Under the bill, polls would close simultaneously in the 48
contiguous states at 9 p.m. EST. In the Pacific Time Zone, daylight
saving time would be extended for a maxiumum of two weeks in
presidential election years. The extension would allow polls in that
time zone to close at 7 p.m. PDT.
   Alaska and Hawaii are exempt from the legislation.
   Swift said the need for a uniform poll closing time became
apparent after the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections when the
television networks, using exit polling data, projected the winners
before western polls closed.
   In 1988, however, the problem was different as President Bush
rolled up a ``large electoral college majority'' before western
polls closed, said Swift.
   ``Had this legislation been in place, all of the polls would have
been closed before a winner was known,'' said Swift.
   Swift said that studies have shown voter turnout can drop by up
to 2 percent when a winner in the presidential contest is known
before the polls close.
   ``This can be a crucial in tight, local elections,'' said Swift.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Says Major Deficit Reduction Would Mean Tax Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee, told President Bush's budget director on
Tuesday that any major reduction in the federal deficit would
require a tax increase.
   ``I don't want to raise taxes, but I can't see how we can achieve
a significant amount of deficit reduction on the spending side
only,'' Rostenkowski said as his committee heard testimony from
Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
   Rostenkowski also told Darman that there was little chance of
enacting two administration tax-increasing proposals, broadening the
Medicare tax to all state and local employees and blocking an
automatic reduction in the airport excise tax. Those ``simply do not
have the votes to pass,'' he said.
   The White House refuses to consider those levies as tax boosts.
In response to questions by the committee, Darman said he might
consider other revenue-raising measures as something other than tax
increases.
   For example, applying the telephone excise tax to wire services,
now exempt, might be considered ``loophole closing,'' he said. Other
changes might be considered user fees.
   But he said Bush had shown no indication that he was softening
his opposition to new taxes.
   ``If someone were going to change his (Bush's) mind, it would
take a major effort,'' he said.
   At a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston, D-La., complained to Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady that the administration was using rosy economic assumptions
and other gimmicks to make its budget proposal fall within the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction targets.
   Johnston said the administration hadn't offered a realistic plan
that could serve as ``a starting point'' for serious negotiations
and that the Gramm-Rudman targets might have to be relaxed even if a
credible plan were advanced.
   He said it was doubtful that ``enough taxes and real budget cuts
with real economic assumptions'' could be enacted to meet the
Gramm-Rudman targets for fiscal 1990.
   Brady defended the administration's economic assumptions as
realistic and said that while Gramm-Rudman was imperfect, ``it is a
form of sanity'' that has been reassuring to financial markets
anxious to see progress toward deficit-reduction.
   Like Darman, Brady said he would oppose changing the Gramm-Rudman
law and its $100 billion deficit limit for fiscal 1990. The
administration claims it has met the target without increasing taxes.
   ``I feel very strongly that we should not move the goal lines,''
he said. ``... I think we do have a starting point. I have optimism
that we're going to reach the goal line without moving it.''
   Darman and Brady plan to resume discussions this week with
congressional budget writers. The administration's goal is
full-scale negotiations on the budget for fiscal 1990, which begins
Oct. 1.
   Congressional Democrats complained that the administration has
been slow to provide information on policies it would favor in a
deficit-reduction plan, especially the cuts required in domestic
programs.
   Bush, in a news conference Tuesday, repeated his assertion that
he has provided Capitol Hill with more detail than other presidents
did at the beginning of their administrations.
   ``More detail has been sent to the hill at this time in our
administration _ let me clarify that _ than at any time for either
the Reagan administration, 1981, or the Carter administration in
'77,'' he said. ``They hadn't gone up with near this amount of
detail to the hill.''

<HEAD>Dead Woman Had Feared Ex-Husband Would Kill Her, Co-Worker Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS P. WYMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MISHAWAKA, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lisa M. Bianco tried to put her past as an
abused wife behind her by working at a women's shelter but always
feared her ex-husband would return from prison to kill her.
   ``She said her choice at that time would be to run, change her
identity and hope he wouldn't identify her, or stay and fight,''
said Michalyn Chilcote, director of the Elkhart County Women's
Shelter. ``She wasn't quite sure what was going to happen.''
   On Saturday, her ex-husband, Alan L. Matheney, 38, did return and
bludgeoned the 29-year-old Ms. Bianco to death outside her home with
the butt of a shotgun, police said.
   Matheney had been freed hours earlier on an eight-hour furlough
from an Indiana prison, where he was serving time for beating his
wife and confining the couple's two children, authorities said.
   Within hours of the woman's death, Matheney surrendered to police
and was taken into custody. Murder charges were filed Tuesday.
   Matheney's arrest ``didn't faze him in the least,'' said South
Bend police Sgt. Norval Williams.
   ``He had, you might say, completed a mission he set out to
achieve,'' Williams said, ``and now that he had done what he wanted
to do he was ready turn himself in, and more or less ready to pay
his dues.''
   Protests mounted over the decision to grant Matheney a furlough
from the Correctional Industrial Complex near the Indiana State
Reformatory at Pendleton, and Gov. Evan Bayh over the weekend
suspended the program.
   ``There are a lot of women who are very, very angry, and angry at
the system,'' said Bonnie Bailey, president of the Mishawaka
Commission on the Status of Women.
   ``Lisa did everything she could to legally get into the system
and get her husband locked up and the system failed,'' she said
Tuesday after an emotional commission meeting.
   Ms. Bianco had become a counselor at the women's shelter in
August and rose quickly into the $14,000-a-year job as program
director, said Ms. Chilcote.
   ``We chose her mainly because she had been an abused woman and
knew what it felt like,'' said Ms. Chilcote. ``She could look at
them and say, `Yeah, I was at the bottom of the pit, too, and I
climbed out.'''
   In December, she asked for and received a volunteer appointment
to the Mishawaka women's commission. ``That was her way of trying to
get her life back together and possibly contributing, helping
others,'' said Ms. Bailey.
   Two state Department of Correction employees were suspended
without pay Monday for issuing the pass and failing to notify Ms.
Bianco that Matheney had been granted the furlough, said department
spokesman Vaughn Overstreet.

<HEAD>Kohl Calls On Soviets To Withdraw Chemical Weapons From Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday urged the
Soviet Union to remove its chemical weapons from Eastern Europe and
destroy them.
   The appeal followed a U.S. proposal to speed the removal of
chemical weapons from West Germany.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a news release, said the Soviets and
United States have a unique opportunity to make significant progress
in ending the threat of chemical warfare.
   ``The United States has taken a step that the Soviet Union and
its allies should now follow without delay,'' Kohl said.
   Referring to the U.S. proposal, he said, ``I call on the Soviet
Union in turn to pull out its chemical weapons stationed in Eastern
Europe and to destroy them.''
   West German opposition leaders have said the U.S. proposal was
vague and disappointing.
   On Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker said President Bush
wanted to explore ways to accelerate the removal of U.S. chemical
weapons from West Germany.
   ``The United States is prepared to lead in dealing with this
problem,'' Baker said, but the early removal of the chemical weapons
will require ``safe storage and the development of practical plans
to destroy them.''
   He also said the Soviet Union has enormous stocks of such weapons
threatening Western Europeand he urged Soviet leaders to join in the
mutual destruction of ``these frightening weapons.''
   In Canberra, Australia, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said
Tuesday that Australia will be the host of an international
conference to halt the proliferation of chemical weapons.
   The meeting is tentatively scheduled for the latter half of the
year but Evans did not say how many countries might attend. A
government spokesman said ``all the major players are expected.''
   ``The momentum is there in terms of the will to get these
horrifying weapons out of ... business once and for all,'' Evans
said.
   He said the conference initiative followed talks with Baker about
how to build on the momentum generated by the Paris Conference on
Chemical Weapons attended by 149 countries in January.
   Kohl said he was hopeful chemical weapons could be withdrawn from
West Germany and Eastern Europe ahead of a 1992 deadline agreed upon
by both sides in 1986.
   He said he assumed that only technical matters had to be dealt
with in securing the early removal of chemical weapons from West
German soil.
   Horst Ehmke, a leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party,
questioned the U.S. plan.
   He said the removal of aging chemical weapons meant nothing if
they might someday be replaced by a new generation of binary
chemical weapons.
   ``The only event to celebrate will be an agreement in Geneva for
the world-wide destruction of chemical weapons,'' Ehmke said.
   Binary chemical weapons use two chemicals that when combined
produce a deadly gas.
   Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Monday that West Germany
agreed to allow the United States to deploy the new binary chemical
weapons if there should be a threat of war.
   Kohl, in a television interview, said he would oppose replacing
the aging weapons in West Germany in an era of declining tensions.
   ``We will do everything in our power to ensure that these weapons
disappear,'' he said. ``We don't need them.''

<HEAD>Top Mushers Battle for Lead in Dog Sled Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Susan Butcher, who won the last two
Iditarod dog-sled races with Rick Swenson on her heels, chased
Swenson on Tuesday as the two winningest mushers in race history
fought for the early lead in the 1,100-mile trek.
   Joe Runyan of Nenana actually was farthest along the trail early
Tuesday. But he had not yet taken his mandatory 24-hour rest stop,
while Swenson, Butcher and five others declared theirs at Rohn,
which is 266 miles from the start in Anchorage and 902 miles from
the finish line in Nome.
   Swenson, Butcher and DeeDee Jonrowe of Willow were expected to
start racing about noon AST Tuesday.
   Historically, Iditarod front-runners have faded badly by the time
they reached Nome, more than 1,100 miles from the start.
   In past years, Butcher, who has won the last three races, and
Swenson, the only four-time winner, have been content to bide their
time, making their moves much later in the race.
   But this year Swenson and Butcher went straight to the front. He
led Butcher into Rohn by 13 minutes.
   ``It just worked out that way,'' Swenson said of their quick
start. ``The thing is there was no one else that was going to go.''
   The two intense, outspoken competitors used to be neighbors in
Manley, but Swenson has moved to Two Rivers. Their rivalry has grown
to epic proportions throughout the state.
   ``I think I can beat her ... but she's got a good team, and she
might beat us all,'' Swenson said. He said his team this year is
better than the one that was runner-up to Butcher last year.
   On Monday, three people escaped serious injury when a
single-engine airplane chartered by an Anchorage TV station crashed
while covering the race.
   The field of mushers dwindled to 46 Monday night when 83-year-old
Norman Vaughan called it quits at Skwentna, just 151 miles into the
race. Two other mushers dropped out earlier at Big Lake, only 71
miles along the way.
   Inpired by a dog-sled relay of serum to Nome for a diphtheria
outbreak in 1925, the Iditarod was founded in 1973. The winner this
year is to get $50,000 of the $250,000 purse. The remainder will be
shared by the next 19 finishers.
   Most of the Iditarod mushers are from Alaska. Others are from
Montana, Minnesota, Wyoming, New York, France and Japan.

   President Bush should be given more time to
organize his administration and put together his policies and
programs, a longtime Bush friend from Texas said Tuesday.
   Robert W. Blake said he was pleased and surprised to hear that
Bush, at a news conference earlier in the day, had cited ``a fellow
from Lubbock'' as ``an objective spokesman'' on the Bush presidency.
   When asked at the outset of the news conference about
commentaries that his administration is in disarray in part because
of the protracted fight with the Senate over Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower, Bush said, ``My response is that
it's not adrift and there isn't malaise.''
   ``And I talked to a fellow from Lubbock, Texas, the other day,
which is the best phone call I've made,'' the president said. ``And
he said all the people in Lubbock think things are going just
great.''
   Blake, who is involved in the oil and gas industry, said in a
telephone interview from Lubbock that Bush had called Sunday.
   ``He's only had 45 days,'' Blake said Tuesday, saying he has
known Bush since 1951 and came to know him better during Bush's
ill-fated 1964 Senate campaign against Democrat Ralph Yarborough.
   ``All they do is criticize him,'' Blake said. ``But he's upbeat.
You will not find George Bush when he's down. He just called; we
talked back and forth, like friends do. I just feel like they ought
to give him a year to 18 months to get things done.''
   Blake, who served on Bush's national campaign finance committee
last year and has made several donations to Bush's campaigns, said
he knows no one ``would would work any harder than George Bush.''
   He said he told Bush not to worry about the Tower problem.
   ``I said, `You pick him, and then you have no more control over
it,''' Blake related.

<HEAD>U.N. Official Calls For `Month of Tranquillity' in Sudan War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior U.N. official on Tuesday called
for a month of peace in the war-torn south to enable the transport
of 100,000 tons of food and medicine to about 2 million people
facing starvation this summer.
   James Grant, director general of the U.N. Children's Fund and
personal representative of U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, said the international community was in a race against time
to position and distribute the supplies in the south before the
rainy season starts in May.
   The operation will cost an estimated $20 million for food that
has not yet arrived in Sudan, $48 million for transportation and
about $12 million for other expenses in Sudan, said James Ingram,
executive director for the U.N. World Food Program.
   He said this amount does not include the worth of the bulk of the
food already in Sudan, nor money for medication or immunization
programs or vital structures like digging wells.
   ``This is a race against time _ a race to avoid the repetition of
the disaster which happened when the rains blocked the
transportation of foodstuff,'' Grant said. He said more than 250,000
people died last year when food was blocked, up to one-half of them
children.
   Grant said 2.25 million southerners in government- and rebel-held
areas needed food and medication in varying degrees this summer and
that 100,000 people could die if the operation failed.
   He spoke on the eve of a U.N.-organized conference in which
Western donor governments, non-governmental relief agencies and the
Sudan governments are participating to organize the ambitious rescue
operation.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army is not representated.
   Ingram described the operation as ``very very daunting'' and
stressed there was an ``absolute need'' for a month of peace.
   Grant said he had indications the rebels might agree to such a
proposal.
   ``We are in some consultation with them. I believe the prospects
of developing a month of tranquillity is something which can emerge
in the next few day,'' he said.
   Sources close to the conference said the donors, especially the
United States, would strongly pressure the Khartoum government to
enter peace talks with the rebels.
   On Monday, U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman urged
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government to talk peace.
   The Sudanese government and the rebels both have used food as a
weapon in the 6-year-old war in the south. Western relief officials
estimate that in 1988 alone, about 560,000 southerners died of
starvation or while fleeing the war.
   The rainy season starts in May and lasts until the end of
September. It turns roads into swamps and makes airstrips unusable.
   Referring to previous international efforts to bring relief to
the south, Grant said they were ``far too short to carry people
through, once the rains start in the spring.''
   Ingram said that starting Wednesday, a six-week program would
begin to transport 3,000 tons of food and supplies to the south in
Hercules C-130s.

<HEAD>Friend of President Charged In Trading Scandal Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roger-Patrice Pelat, a longtime friend of President
Francois Mitterrand, died Tuesday in a hospital three weeks after he
was charged in an insider trading scandal that has embarrassed
France's Socialist government. He was 70.
   Pelat was admitted to the American Hospital in the Paris suburb
of Neuilly on Feb. 27 suffering a pulmonary embolism and died of a
heart attack Tuesday, a spokeswoman said. She spoke on condition of
anonymity in keeping with hospital policy.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse said Mitterrand went
to the hospital after hearing of Pelat's death.
   Pelat and Mitterrand met in a German prisoner-of-war camp in 1940
and later fought together in the French Resistance.
   Over national television on Feb. 12, Mitterrand defended Pelat as
a man of courage and integrity, but said if Pelat were found guilty
of an offense, ``then in my role as president I would not be able to
maintain the same kind of friendship I have had with him for so
long.''
   Four days later, Pelat was charged with receiving insider
information that allowed him to buy shares of the U.S. company
Triangle Industries Inc. shortly before the French state-owned
aluminum manufacturer Picheney SA offered a much higher price last
year in a successful takeover.
   Pelat and his family sold their shares after the price soared,
making a profit of about $350,000.
   Five others also were charged by an investigating magsitrate with
receiving insider information or with insider trading. Either charge
carries the same maximum penalty of two years in prison and a fine
of up to four times the amount of illegal profits.

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International urged Jamaica on Wednesday to
abolish its death penalty and allow its 200 prisoners on death row
to live, saying many may not have had a fair trial.
   The London-based human rights group, which opposes the death
penalty unconditionally, said many of the prisoners are poor and
illiterate and were not well represented in court. Some have been
convicted by a single witness's testimony and have difficulties
making appeals, it said in its 85-page report.
   Jamaica's death row population is one of the highest per capita
in the world. The West Indies island nation has about 2.3 million
people.
   The death penalty, which was halted for four years ending in
1981, is mandatory for murder in Jamaica, said Amnesty. It said
authorities hanged 59 people between August 1980 and February 1988.
   Amnesty's report covered conditions from 1984 to 1988.
   It said nearly half of those sentenced to death have spent more
than five years on death row, and some have been there for 12 years.
   They are kept in the St. Catherine District Prison outside the
capital Kingston, where they live in unsanitary conditions, without
opportunities to exercise or work, the report said.

   Ridge released a copy of a letter dated Monday to Frank Light, of
the State Department, from Abdullahi A. Addou, Somali ambassador to
the United States.
   The letter said that the Somali president ``has granted amnesty
to the following people and they are free from prison,'' and listed
21 prisoners, including Sulieman Nuh Ali. Ali's case has been
investigated by Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
group that had classified him as a ``prisoner of conscience.''
   According to Ridge, Ali was held without charges since 1982 and
then was found guilty of treason last year.
   Ali, 45, attended Pennsylvania's Allegheny College in the
mid-1960s before transferring to Howard University and earning a
degree in architecture and urban planning.
   He took a job with the Somalia Ministry of Public Works building
low-cost housing for workers, then went into business for himself.
   A former classmate helped launch a student petition drive at the
Pennsylvania school, and 28 House and Senate members recently sent a
telegram of protest to the Somali president.

<HEAD>Administration Still Weighing Third World Debt Moves</HEAD>

   The Bush administration has completed a review
of Third World debt strategy but is still deciding what approaches
to take to the problem, officials said Tuesday.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady refused to answer specific
questions about a published report detailing elements of the plan
the administration has under review. He told reporters after
congressional testimony on the Bush budget that questions about
Third World debt would be answered at an upcoming hearing.
   Art Siddon, a Treasury Department spokesman, said the Treasury
Department had completed its review and officials were examining
possible changes but that no final decisions had been made.
   Siddon said he could not comment on a Washington Post story which
said the administration's plan would put heavy emphasis on
encouraging banks to voluntarily forgive part of the debt owed to
them by developing nations.
   The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying that the plan
under consideration by the administration would emphasize reducing
the size of outstanding debt and would tap the resources of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to make it more
attractive for banks to forgive a portion of their loans.
   In a speech last week, Brady termed Third World debt ``perhaps
the most difficult'' of the major issues facing the new
administration.
   ``Unlike the federal budget deficit or even the savings and loan
industry crisis, this is not a problem that we in the U.S. have the
power or the resources to solve by ourselves,'' Brady said in a
speech to the American Bankers Association.
   The new administration is receiving pressure from U.S. allies to
go beyond the ``Baker plan,'' formulated by Secretary of State James
A. Baker III in 1985 when he was Treasury secretary in the Reagan
administration.
   Under the Baker plan, the international banking community was to
provide about $30 billion in new loans to Third World debtors who
agreed to make economic reforms.
   However, the amount of new bank lending fell far short of the
goals and as a result there has been growing pressure for a new
approach that would reduce the debt burden.
   That pressue intensified last week after riots in Venezuela which
were touched off after the newly elected government of President
Carlos Andres Perez announced austerity measures as part of an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund to get more loans for
the debt-strapped country.
   In another development Tuesday, the Twentieth Century Fund
released a report calling for the Bush administration to support
major new initiatives to resolve the debt crisis.
   ``The long shadow cast by the debt crisis covers far more than
the economies of the debtor countries,'' the report concluded. ``It
threatens democratic institutions in debtor countries, strains
North-South relations and poses serious political risks for
creditors as well as debtors.''
   The report, prepared by a 12-member task force of business
leaders, politicians and academics, recommended extention and
flexible rescheduling of existing interest payments as ways of
reducing the $1.3 trillion debt burden carried by the Third World.
   John Gaines Heimann, vice chairman of Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets and the head of the task force, said he hoped the Bush
administration would go further than the Baker plan in addressing
the debt problem.
   ``The administration seems to be taking a very pragmatic point of
view and I hope that is evidenced in their set of recommendations,''
he said.
   The Twentieth Century Fund is a non-partisan research group which
has conducted a two-year study of Third World debt.

   The Communist Party has lost members and
may suffer more defections as Hungary approaches multiple-party
politics, party officials said Tuesday.
   A Justice Ministry official said the new constitution to be
enacted by Parliament will guarantee independent parties the right
to exist, but the first open elections under the charter will not be
held until 1995.
   Party officials also are preparing to sponsor an East-West
conference in Budapest of Christian Democrat, Liberal, Socialist and
Communist parties to discuss the concept of a ``common Europe.''
   Janos Berecz, secretary for ideology, told reporters after a
Central Committee meeting about 3,000 members left the party during
the recent debate over the 1956 Hungarian revolt.
   Imre Pozsgay, a reformer and member of the ruling Politburo,
caused controversy by saying the revolt, crushed by the Soviets, was
a popular uprising, not a counterrevolution as in the official
version.
   He based his assessment on a report of a party committee
reviewing Hungary's postwar history. A subsequent Central Committee
session issued a statement saying the revolt began as a popular
uprising but became a counterrevolution.
   Tuesday's meeting adopted a manifesto that appears designed to
inform and reassure rank-and-file party members who have become
confused about widely publicized political and economic reforms at a
time of inflation, declining living standards and a rising deficit.
   Berecz told the Central Committee reform was the only course for
Hungary. ``We (Communists) have no other alternative because, during
the elections, the nation will decide in favor of the party of
consistent reforms in their own interests,'' he declared.
   He said the party's membership might continue to decline but it
would gain new meaning for the public by professing the values of
freedom, justice and solidarity.
   ``We should expect that the ... competition of the various
political movements will impose an encouraging or even compelling
force on us,'' he said of alternative parties and groups organized
in recent months.
   Many of those hope to win seats in Parliament when the
multiple-party system becomes reality.
   Geza Kileni of the Justice Ministry told journalists the new
constitution, to be submitted to a referendum next year, will not
mean open politics immediately and that the transition ``could last
several years.''
   He said the first parliamentary elections based on the new
charter would be in 1995, but a multiple-party system would be
established before that.
   Trade unions, interest groups and possibly others will be allowed
to enter candidate in next year's elections but the rules have not
been determined, he said.
   Party spokesman Laszlo Major said the conference on a ``common
Europe'' should be held in early summer and that 22 parties from
East and West would be represented, including the Liberals and
Progressive Conservatives of Canada and the U.S. Democratic Party.
   He said only parties from the Soviet Union, Poland and Yugoslavia
would attend from Eastern Europe.

   A prominent Lebanese banker who was
reported to have been kidnapped called his office Tuesday and said
he would return within 48 hours.
   Roger Tamraz told his Paris office: ``Tell everyone not to panic.
It's finished now. I will be with you in 24 to 48 hours,'' a
colleague said.
   The colleague, who spoke by telephone from Paris on condition of
anonymity, said Tamraz did not disclose his location.
   On Monday, another associate said Tamraz had been kidnapped Feb.
19 and was being held for ransom. He said he believed those holding
Tamraz were acting for people who suffered losses in the recent
collapse of Lebanon's second-largest bank, Bank Al-Mashrek, which
Tamraz headed until December.
   Bank Al-Mashrek is involved in a liquidity crisis with several
subsidiaries, including banks in Switzerland, France, Jordan and
Qatar.
   The colleague in Paris said Tamraz, 48, asked him to tell the
press that he had been ``in retreat to prepare my case.''
   The Beirut daily As-Safir reported Tuesday that Tamraz had called
to say he was ``not the victim of a kidnap operation.''
   Asked Tuesday about the report, the associate said: ``What does
one mean by kidnap? He is a guest but he is not free to move before
he settles certain accounts.''
   The associate said Tamraz was seized when he went to a meeting in
Chtaura, a town in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley Feb. 19.
   He said a $1.5 million payment was made several days later after
Tamraz contacted family and friends.
   Tamraz was not released after the first payment and a second
payment was demended, the associate said.
   Tamraz, a Maronite Catholic, was educated at Cambridge University
in England and at the Harvard Business School.

   Masked gunmen killed three men
Tuesday as they chatted at a village gas station and then escaped in
a car that had been stolen about 15 minutes before the attack,
police reported.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army asserted responsility and in a
statment to the local news media claimed the service station was a
stronghold of the Ulster Volunteer Force, a Protestant paramilitary
group that also is banned.
   Police said the three men were slain in Coagh, 50 miles west of
Belfast, and none had any connection with Northern Ireland's
security forces.
   The victims were identified by local residents as Leslie Dallas,
in his early 40s and owner of the station; Ernest Rankin, 72, who
was retired, and Austin Nelson, in his 60s, a retired truck driver
and violin maker who appeared on a television program Monday to
discuss music in Northern Ireland, a British province.
   During the program Nelson said, ``Whenever I pass on _ hopefully
not for a while yet _ nobody will remember Austin Nelson.''
   Police said two of the men were killed instantly and the third
died on his way to a hospital.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said children
leaving a school bus saw the shootings and reported the killers
cheered as they drove away.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,
issued a statement saying, ``The murders occurred at the corner
where local people congregate to chat. The brutality of these
murders and their open sectarianism must be condemned.''
   Adrian Ringland, the chief superintendent of the local RUC unit,
told Britain's Independent Television News: ``This is total anarchy
... when in a quiet village in the middle of Tyrone you get a
situation where people come in with high-powered rifles and just
spray bullets indiscriminately around a business premises in the
village _ absolute horror.''
   The Rev. William McCrea, a Protestant minister and a member of
Parliament from the area, visited the scene and said: ``The gunmen
opened fire from a passing car. They came down the street, opened up
on the garage and brutally did to death these men.''
   Denis Haughey, the local representative for the Social Democratic
and Labor Party, the province's largest Roman Catholic party, called
the killings ``a foul and brutal act.''
   Police said the car used by the killers was stolen about 15
minutes before the shootings by two armed men a few miles away in
the Catholic stronghold of Ballinderry near Ardboe.
   The Ulster Volunteer Force claimed responsibility last month for
killing John Joe Davey, a town councilor in the area for Sinn Fein,
the legal political wing of the predominantly Catholic IRA.
   Also on Tuesday police announced they discovered a cache of guns,
ammunition and Czechoslovak-made Semtex explosives buried in a wood
in northern England, near the seaside town of Scarborough where
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is to attend a conference of her
Conservative Party in April.
   Semtex is often used for IRA bombings. In 1984, Mrs. Thatcher
narrowly escaped injury when an IRA bomb exploded in the hotel where
she was staying for a party conference in Brighton, southern
England. Five people died in the blast.
   More than 2,720 people have been slain in Northern Ireland in
nearly 20 years of political and sectarian conflict, 15 of them this
year.
   The IRA is fighting to unite the province, where Protestants
outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the mainly Catholic Irish Republic.

   The District of Columbia Council, taking
emergency action in an attempt to curb drug-related violence in the
nation's capital, voted Tuesday to require that people who use guns
when they commit a crime in the city must be sentenced to five years
in prison.
   It approved a bill also aimed at improving the city's
before-trial detention program by allowing judges to refuse to
permit bond for people accused of violent crimes even if they have
no criminal record.
   ``This is an emergency bill, and requires a lot of debate, but
these are emergency times,'' said James Nathanson, a member of the
council. ``The people of this city are telling us we have to do
something.''
   The emergency measure, which will remain in effect for 90 days
before being reviewed, came as the city sought to slow the pace of
drug-related killings. Police blame about 60 percent of last year's
record 372 killings on drugs. So far this year, 98 people have been
slain in the district, 43 more than during the matching period in
1988.
   The legislation also attempts to stem a flow of illegally
purchased weapons into the nation's capital. According to police
statistics, 3,863 weapons were seized on city streets during 1988,
compared with 2,225 the year before.
   The bill survived a challenge from several council members who
complained that it would clog the city's already overcrowded court
and prison systems, and objections from others who said it needed
more debate.
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. proposed the measure almost two weeks ago,
saying the city should start ``an all-out assault on weapons.''
Since then, city, police and court officials have twice met to
discuss the bill.
   The emergency measure strengthens the city's handgun law, already
considered one of the toughest in the nation. The old law set
maximum punishment at one year in jail and a $1,000 fine for anyone
caught with unregistered weapons.

   China imposed martial law on the Tibetan capital
of Lhasa after three days of bloody riots protesting Chinese rule,
and an American traveler said thousands of soldiers flooded the city
early Wednesday.
   Tibetan mobs had ransacked Chinese-owned stores and burned their
contents, stoned government buildings and attacked Chinese in
demonstrations for independence and an end to Chinese rule in the
remote mountain area.
   Official accounts said at least 12 people were killed and more
than 100 wounded. Unofficial reports had up to 75 people killed and
300 injured.
   Police imposed a temporary curfew and cleared the streets Tuesday
afternoon, threatening to shoot anyone found in the central square
or in the Tibetan section nearby, the traveler said by telephone
from Lhasa.
   At midnight, jeeps carrying loudspeakers sped through the city
ordering residents to stay inside and informing them martial law had
begun, he said.
   It was the first time since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution that
martial law had been publicly announced in China.
   Dozens of trucks packed with soldiers of the People's Liberation
Army later entered Lhasa, the American reported.
   ``Soldiers were patrolling in the streets,'' said a report by
Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, quoting Maj. Gen. Zhang
Shaosong, political commissar of the Tibet regional military command.
   ``There's a lot of sirens going and a lot of troop movement
outside,'' said the American, who spoke on condition of not being
identified for fear of police reprisals.
   He said he was speaking from a hotel in the center of Lhasa and
had stopped looking out the window after a soldier came to the
window and blocked his view.
   ``Now I'm here with a blanket over my head in the office hoping
that no one will notice,'' he said, speaking in a muffled voice so
as not to attract attention.
   Xinhua said the whole city and parts of two adjoining counties
would be ``cordoned off'' and ``all meetings, parades, strikes,
petitions and any other gathering are banned.'' The order also gave
security forces vast powers to stop vehicles and pedestrians in the
city of 70,000people.
   No foreigners were allowed to enter Lhasa without permission, and
those in the area without permission were required to leave, the
order said. The American, who said he had not been informed of the
rule, estimated there were about 80 foreigners in Lhasa.
   The nationally televised nightly news announced martial law
Tuesday evening, saying the Lhasa city government had been
authorized to take ``any measures necessary to restore order.''
   ``Any person who defies martial law or who instigates others to
do so will be severely punished,'' said the order, approved by
China's Cabinet and signed by Premier Li Peng.
   Xinhua said martial law had been imposed because ``separatists
have been constantly causing disturbances in the city over the past
few days.''
   In Geneva, Chinese delegate Li Zuomin told the U.N. Human Rights
Commission the riots were triggered by ``a few separatists (who) do
not wish to see progress and better living standards in Tibet'' and
by terrorists sent from outside. He said the violence ``endangered
the security and sovereignty of China'' and forced authorities to
take ``corresponding measures.''
   On Sunday and Monday, clashes between police and Tibetans left 11
Tibetans and one Chinese policeman dead, along with 100 wounded,
official reports said. On Tuesday, Westerners quoted Tibetans as
saying as many as 75 died and 300 were wounded _ including an
instance in which Chinese militia burst into homes and killed at
least five people.
   Two groups of about 100 Tibetans marched Tuesday near the main
square and on Beijing Road, the main thoroughfare. Police then
cleared the streets, the American said. Sounds of gunfire crackled
in the afternoon.
   ``All the Tibetans just disappeared, everybody just evaporated,''
said the American, who was given shelter in a Tibetan house. But by
nightfall, Tibetans began to venture outside again and a bonfire
blazed on Beijing Road after Tibetans ransacked and burned another
Chinese store.
   Martial law was not imposed in outbreaks of pro-independence
violence in Lhasa in the past 18 months that left scores dead and
hundreds hurt.
   The government last imposed martial law during the ultra-leftist
Cultural Revolution in 1966-76 when bands of Red Guards fought armed
battles on the streets of dozens of cities. A form of martial law
was declared on all of Tibet on March 23, 1959, after an aborted
uprising against Chinese rule.
   China claims Tibet has been part of China since the 13th century.
Many Tibetans say Tibet should be independent and led by the
traditional Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama, who fled in exile during
the aborted uprising in 1959.
   On Monday, the Dalai Lama appealed to world leaders to persuade
the Chinese to find a peaceful solution to the protests.
   The Dalai Lama has proposed that China grant Tibet autonomy in
its internal affairs in exchange for the stationing of Chinese
troops on Tibetan soil and the management of Tibet's foreign
relations by Beijing. China has rejected the proposal but is
considering the Dalai Lama's proposal of negotiations.
   In India, the Dalai Lama's administration said Tuesday it was not
surprised by the imposition of martial law.
   ``For all practical purposes Lhasa was already under martial law.
The Chinese have only formalized it,'' said Tashi Wongdi, the
Tibetan leader's chief representative in New Delhi, when contacted
by telephone.

<TEXT>
   This city took some of the wind out of
Peoria, Ill.'s perennial bluster of being Everytown U.S.A. when
President Bush said the people of Lubbock think he's doing a fine
job.
   When reporters questioned Bush Tuesday about criticism that his
administration was adrift, he replied:
   ``I talked to a fellow from Lubbock, Texas, the other day which
was the best phone call I've made. And he said, `All the people in
Lubbock think things are going just great.'''
   So what do Lubbockites really think about that Texan in the White
House?
   ``I really haven't been paying that much attention,'' said
Shirley Hubbard, a convenience store clerk.
   ``They're (Congress) giving him a hard time about (John) Tower,
but I say stick with it,'' said retiree William Berns. ``He knows
what he's doing.''
   While the majority of people questioned about Bush by a reporter
outside the post office approved of his leadership thus far, most
wouldn't give their names.
   ``He's a Texan and he understands us,'' said one man.
   Matt Malouf, who wrote a letter to the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal
last week, defended Bush and blasted the Senate for its handling of
Tower's confirmation as defense secretary: ``I would rather be ruled
by the first 100 names in the Lubbock phone book than these clowns
who now reign in the Senate.''
   In choosing Lubbock as his example of middle America, Bush picked
an easy sell.
   This city on the South Plains has a population of 186,400 and
more than 150 churches, many of them large and conservative.
Residents of Lubbock County gave the GOP ticket 69 percent of the
vote in November.
   Here, the agrigulture-based economy rises or falls on the
strength of the annual cotton crop. Two consecutive strong harvests
gave this city the lowest unemployment rate in the state at 5.2
percent.
   Lubbock is also the home of one of Bush's dearest friends,
independent oil investor Robert W. Blake, who was the caller Bush
was referring to when he said Lubbockites were behind him.
   Blake said Tuesday he was surprised and pleased to hear Bush
citing him as ``an objective spokesman'' on the Bush presidency. The
two had spoken on Sunday.
   ``He's only had 45 days,'' Blake said, saying he has known Bush
since 1951 and got to know him better during Bush's unsuccessful
1964 Senate campaign against Democrat Ralph Yarborough.
   ``All they do is criticize him,'' Blake said. ``But he's upbeat.
You will not find George Bush when he's down. He just called, we
talked back and forth, like friends do. I just feel like they ought
to give him a year to 18 months to get things done.''
   Lubbock Mayor B.C. ``Peck'' McMinn said people here are ``pretty
representative of how the run-of-the-mill people feel across the
country. Not the political hype or anything, but the rock-solid
thinkers are pretty representative of how the situation is going.''

<HEAD>Sullivan Sees No Reason to Change Catastrophic Care Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan told Congress on Tuesday that he sees no reason to change
the new catastrophic care program financed by a surtax on elderly
Americans.
   ``We're aware of a number of concerns that have been expressed
(about the financing provision) but ... we are also concerned about
the many examples of our elderly citizens being wiped out
financially by the tremendous costs of illness,'' Sullivan said.
   ``We feel that because this legislation has just been enacted we
don't have much experience with it yet. We'd like to follow this and
see if adjustments need to be made,'' he told the House Ways and
Means Committee.
   Leaders in the House and Senate also have been generally
unsympathetic to the complaints from senior citizens who oppose the
financing provision of the program, which helps the elderly and
disabled bear the cost of illness that otherwise would threaten
their financial stability.
   For Medicare-eligible Americans _ those who are over 65 or
disabled _ whose incomes are high enough that they pay at least $150
a year in federal income taxes, the surtax is 15 percent of their
income tax this year. Next year it is 25 percent and it could rise
by as much as 1 percentage point a year after that.
   Sullivan's testimony to the House panel was his first before a
congressional committee since his confirmation to the Bush Cabinet
by the Senate last week.
   ``We welcome you to the reality of budget deficits,'' said Rep.
Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the committee. ``You'll find
us as agreeable as the budget permits.''
   The secretary was asked many of the same questions he had been
asked at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance
Committee and a subsequent hearing before the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee. At those hearings, he deferred on many of the
budget questions that were raised, saying he had not participated in
detailed budget discussions with Bush administration officials.
   Rostenkowski said President Bush's proposal to reduce Medicare
spending in fiscal 1990 by $5 billion is unacceptable and the
effects of the deficit-reducing Gramm-Rudman law are preferable. If
Gramm-Rudman cuts were made, Medicare spending in 1990 would be
reduced by about $2 billion.
   Sullivan, however, said the across-the-board cuts of the
Gramm-Rudman law would ``tie our hands to utilize funds that are
available in the most productive way.''
   The secretary also assured the panel that the administration's
proposed cutbacks _ chiefly freezing and scaling back increases in
payments to hospitals and physicians _ were designed not to affect
benefit levels.

   The Communist Party leadership in the

single-party rule in Yugoslavia, newspapers said Tuesday.
   The party leadership in Slovenia, the most westward-looking of
Yugoslavia's six republics, has long advocated the necessity of
radical reforms in overcoming the country's worst social and
economic crisis.
   This was the first time, however, that the party's ruling
presidium has come out openly in favor of ending one-party rule.
   ``The end must come to socialist (Communist) and all other
fundamentalisms,'' said a document formally adopted Monday by
Slovenia's party presidium.
   The document, published Tuesday by the Vecernje Novosti daily,
was intended to serve as a guideline for upcoming political and
economic reforms in Yugoslavia.
   It alluded to traditional beliefs based on a literal
interpretation of Marxism-Leninism and regarded as fundamental to
Communist faith.
   ``Instead of ... single-party rule ... political pluralism should
be affirmed,'' the document said.
   The party will support ``freedom, democracy, political pluralism,
economic efficiency'' and the creation of an ``affluent society
within Europe,'' Vjesnik, another daily, quoted the statement as
saying.
   Yugoslavia has been a single-party state since 1946, when the
Communist Party abolished all forms of opposition. Recently,
however, a number of alternative groups, including a full-fledged
Social Democratic Party, have been set up in Slovenia and in the
neighboring republic of Croatia.
   The founding of independent alternative groups has met with
vehement opposition in Yugoslavia's largest republic of Serbia,
where thousands of university students demonstrated last week
demanding an end to the groups in Slovenia and Croatia.
   Serbia's hard-line party leadership is generally believed to have
orchestrated the demonstrations. It has repeatedly called for
abolition of the independent groups.

<HEAD>Iran Severs Relations with Britain Over Rushdie Book</HEAD>

on moderates advocating better relations with West</HEAD>

   Iran broke relations with Britain on
Tuesday because it refused to suppress ``The Satanic Verses,'' whose
author is under a death sentence by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for
blaspheming Islam.
   Khomeini's fundamentalist Shiite Moslem regime, which has put a
price of $5.2 million on novelist Salman Rushdie's head, said it was
determined to defend Islam from foreign insults.
   Britain said the 88-year-old patriarch's order that his followers
kill Rushdie, a British citizen, violated the principles of
international relations and the diplomatic rupture was ``entirely of
Iran's making.''
   Iran decided Feb. 27 to sever diplomatic ties unless Britain met
its demands, expressed as follows in a parliamentary resolution:
   ``If the British government does not declare in a maximum period
of one week its opposition to the unprincipled stand against the
world of Islam, the Islamic republic of Iran and the contents of the
anti-Islamic book `The Satanic Verses,' the Foreign Ministry of the
Islamic Republic of Iran is obliged to break all bilateral political
ties.''
   Moslems object to what they see as Rushdie's portrayal of the
prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and his implication that
Mohammed wrote the holy Koran rather than receiving it from Allah.
Rushdie says the novel, published last year, is a secular study of
good and evil that is not meant to offend Moslems.
   More than a dozen countries have banned the book, including
Egypt, India, Pakistan and Iran. Riots it inspired in India and
Pakistan have taken at least 19 lives.
   Rushdie, 41, was born in Bombay, India, to Moslem parents but has
said he no longer practices religion. He has been in hiding since
Khomeini pronounced the death sentence and Iranian clerics offered
the reward.
   In London, the Foreign Office said Tuesday that British officials
had not received formal notification from Iran and learned but
learned of the action through news reports and a Tehran radio
broadcast.
   Hussein Musavi, the Iranian premier, said on Iran's state radio
that Britain had made ``a big mistake'' and Moslem countries would
not permit their beliefs to be insulted.
   ``We are prepared to employ all our might in order to defend the
borders of our beliefs,'' he said.
   An Iranian statement accused Britain, which Khomeini's clerics
consider their worst Western enemy after the ``Great Satan'' United
States, of ``being in the front line of plots and treachery against
Moslems'' for two centuries.
   ``The world oppressors and the West, which find genuine Islam
against their objectives and their plots, have risen against Islam
and in this anti-Islamic campaign the role of the British government
is salient,'' said the Foreign Ministry statement, distributed by
the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   After Khomeini ordered Rushdie killed, Britain closed its embassy
in Tehran and its 11 European Economic Community partners _ along
with Canada, Norway and Sweden _ recalled their ambassadors to Iran.
   The confrontation with Britain quashed attempts by more moderate
elements in Tehran to open up to Western Europe in hopes of trade
and economic assistance in rebuilding after the 8-year-old with
Iraq. A cease-fire in the war was reached last August.
   A Foreign Office issued Tuesday in London said: ``The present
situation is entirely of Iran's making. Incitement to murder is a
violation of the most elementary principles and obligations that
govern relations between sovereign states.
   ``It is Iran's actions which have removed the substance from our
relations and made it impossible to conduct normal business.''
   The dispute arose as relations between Britain and Iran were
returning to normal. In December, Britain re-opened its embassy in
Tehran, which had been closed for eight years.
   Sweden, whose envoy returned to Tehran over the weekend, will
resume handling British interests in Iran.
   Relatives of the three Britons missing in Lebanon expressed
dismay. The three are believed held by Shiites loyal to Iran and
another Briton, Roger Cooper, is imprisoned in Tehran on espionage
charges.
   The British Foreign Office said Iran canceled a scheduled visit
to Cooper on Tuesday by a Swedish diplomat.
   ``We will have to sit back and wait, rather dismayed,'' said John
Waite, a cousin of Anglican church envoy Terry Waite. ``Nothing can
ever be resolved unless there are discussions with the other side;
that was the whole basis of Terry's life.''
   Terry Waite, 49, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while trying to
negotiate the release of two American hostages. Nine Americans are
among the 15 foreign captives in Lebanon.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Sir Geoffrey Howe, her
foreign minister, have said they realize the novel offends Moslems.
They insist the death threat be dropped, however, and reject demands
that the book be banned and its author prosecuted.
   In other developments:
   _Indonesia's attorney general, Sukarton Marmosudjono, said the
book would soon be banned in that country.
   _At least 700 schoolchildren marched in Dhaka, Bangladesh to
protest the novel, and President Hussain Mohammad Ershad said
Rushdie should be put on trial.
   _In Canada, two buildings at the University of Alberta campus in
Edmonton were shut down for several hours Monday because of a bomb
threat protesting a scheduled discussion of ``The Satanic Verses,''
officials said. No bomb was found.

   From the Cathedral of Chartres' soaring Gothic
vaults to Picasso's weightless Desmoiselles d'Avignon, works of art
have long been associated with flight.
   Now, Boston artist Lowry Burgess' sculpture ``Boundless
Aperture'' is scheduled to take off with the space shuttle Discovery
and give art a lift, quite literally, out of this world.
   The 7-pound cubic sculpture, part of the artist's 20-year effort
to stretch the human imagination, is the nation's first and possibly
last interstellar art offering.
   ``If any art went up previously it was done without our knowledge
and we certainly don't approve of it,'' said Tony Maull, who was
staff director for the NASA committee that approved Burgess's work
for flight. ``And there is no intention to send any other objects up
at this time.''
   Burgess conceived his ``Boundless Aperture'' sculpture more than
two decades ago as part of a larger project entitled ``The Quiet
Axis,'' that includes one sculpture embedded in the Pacific Ocean
floor off Easter Island and another placed in the Hindu Kush
mountains in central Afghanistan.
   ``Boundless Aperture'' consists of a 6-inch cube inside of which
floats another cube bearing colorful holographic plates inscribed
with poetry. On its return it will be placed inside a rock
outcropping on the DeCordova Museum's grounds in Lincoln, Mass.
   The artist allows that his latest sculpture is fairly esoteric,
but insists that anyone can appreciate space art.
   ``There are more art enthusiasts out there than the people at the
museums,'' he said. ``A lot of people are very eager to see a
cultural dimension to the space effort. It's humanizing.''

   Big Stan is losing his marbles.
   Big Stan is the 80-story, marble-sheathed headquarters of Amoco
Corp., nicknamed back when the company was known as Standard Oil of
Indiana. At 1,136 feet, it is the tallest marble-faced building in
the world.
   But not for long.
   Amoco officials say Big Stan's 43,000 marble panels are coming
loose and must go.
   The panels will be replaced with granite during a facelift that
begins next month and could cost up to $80 million before its
completion in three years, said Shelby C. Pierce, manager of
engineering for Amoco.
   ``We decided to bite the bullet rather than continue forever on a
maintenance program,'' Pierce said Monday of the replacement
project. ``We decided to get it over with.''
   Many Chicago artists and architects are ready for the change.
   ``Carrara marble, which is what's on the building, is
beautiful,'' says architect Walter Netsch. ``Michelangelo used it.
But Michelangelo didn't leave his work outside.''
   The used marble is too weak for buildings and too warped for
countertops. Until a buyer is found, the marble will be piled up
outside the headquarters, said Pierce.
   ``This granite is very strong and stable,'' he said. ``I wanted
to make sure that 15 years from now someone doesn't have to go
through what I'm going through.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. soldiers will be used against the
narcotics trade in drug-producing nations only in support roles and
at the request of those countries, U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh said Tuesday.
   Thornburgh commented near the end of a visit to Bolivia during
which he met with government officials, including President Victor
Paz Estenssoro, and addressed a conference on drug abuse.
   ``It is important to reaffirm this administration's position with
regard to the use of military forces outside the United States,'' he
told a news conference.
   ``These forces will never be mobilized except at the request of
the host country and only in ways that would provide logistical and
law enforcement support to these countries.''
   About 50 U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, border patrol, Coast Guard
and military training and advisory personnel now are assigned to
Bolivia in those capacities.
   The United States sent 195 soldiers to Bolivia for three months
in 1986 to provide logistical support for raids on labs that process
coca leaves, the basis of cocaine.
   Since the soldiers left, Washington has increased its support to
Bolivia's anti-drug campaign, training and equipping 600 narcotics
police permanently assigned to coca-producing regions.
   Thornburgh is visiting Bolivia, Peru and Colombia to meet with
leaders about how to stem the flow of drugs. Traveling with him is
Jack Lawn, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   In his speech to a meeting of the U.N. Fund for Drug Abuse and
Control in La Paz, the attorney general said Bolivia's
``accomplishments in securing democratic principles and overseeing
an important economic recovery have earned President Paz Estenssoro
great acclaim in the United States.''
   He said the Bush administration is preparing a strategy against
drug abuse and production.
   ``We recognize the relationship between demand and consumption of
drugs is equally important as interdiction and crop reduction,''
Thornburgh declared.
   The U.S. Embassy said $15 million had been budgeted for drug
interdiction in Bolivia for fiscal 1989 but it had been cut to $9.5
million.
   This impoverished nation of 7 million people produces the raw
material for at least one-third of the cocaine that reaches U.S. And
European markets, theDEA says.
   At least 350,000 Bolivians make their livings growing coca
leaves. The leaves are processed into cocaine paste, which is
refined into cocaine.

   The Bank of Spain on Tuesday approved a $35O
million loan to provide Venezuela with temporary economic relief
after rioting over austerity measures killed at least 300 people
there last week.
   The bank said in a statement that it arranged an immediate loan
of $200 million with the Central Bank of Venezuela to be be paid off
by the end of the year once Venezuela begins to receive emergency
financing from the International Monetary Fund.
   The Bank of Spain will make available $150 million more after
Venezuela and the IMF sign an economic adjustment program.
   The announcement, which gave no further details, had been
expected since Spain announced March 3 that a bridge loan was being
put together.
   Venezuela's reserves are depleted as a result of the country's
$33 billion foreign debt, the fourth-largest in Latin America.
   Venezuela, a founding member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, saw its fortunes sag greatly after oil prices
plunged in 1981.

   A Democratic senator said Tuesday he had seen
Defense Secretary-designate John Tower ``under the influence of
alcohol'' in the Senate, making the dramatic claim shortly after
President Bush insisted that ``not one'' senator has first-hand
evidence that Tower had a drinking problem.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, meanwhile, flatly
predicted the nomination would be rejected when it comes to a vote.
Even so, Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut became the second
Democrat to support confirmation.
   ``I owe John Tower the same fairness and careful judgment he used
22 years ago,'' Dodd said, referring to Tower's 1967 defense of Tom
Dodd, then a senator and the father of the current senator. The
elder Dodd was censured by the Senate for improper use of campaign
funds.
   Despite Dodd's decision, Democrats showed increasing confidence
in their ability to prevail and as Republicans complained bitterly
about the tactics of a key Democratic opponent to the nomination,
Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia.
   In a riveting exchange on the fourth day of increasingly heated
debate, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said he saw Tower ``under
the influence of alcohol'' while on the Senate floor. Tower was a
senator from 1961 to 1984.
   ``But inebriated to the point that he could not operate?''
interrupted Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
   ``I have not seen him inebriated to the extent he could not
perform his duties,'' replied DeConcini, who said later he had seen
Tower ``under the influence'' several times.
   But Tower, in a statement, denied the charge, saying, ``I have
never been inebriated on the Senate floor.''
   Bush, in a session earlier Tuesday with White House reporters,
repeated his oft-stated insistence that no senators had first-hand
information that Tower was hampered by a drinking problem.
   ``I haven't had one single senator _ not one _ (who) served with
him over the years, say, `I have seen him. My first-hand evidence is
this man is ineligible because of his consumption of spirits,'''
Bush said.
   Mitchell said that despite the decision Monday of Southern
Democrat Howell Heflin of Alabama to support Tower, the nomination
will lose.
   ``I believe that when the vote occurs the nomination will be
rejected and it is obvious if the Republicans had the votes they
would now be demanding the vote take place,'' Mitchell told
reporters.
   ``I frankly see no benefit to anyone ... in unnecessarily and
needlessly prolonging this matter,'' he said.
   But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said, ``This has
just barely started.''
   He left open the possibility of asking the Senate to let Tower
answer the charges against him on the floor itself. But he seemed to
concede it would be a last-ditch attempt to stave off defeat, and
Democrats said Tower had ample opportunity to defend himself before
Nunn's committee.
   ``If we can see 50 votes, we don't need to make the request,''
Dole said. ``But if we need one or two, the answer is yes ... yes,
we're going to make the request. I'd like to hear John Tower defend
his record in the Senate.''
   An Associated Press survey shows 47 Democrats and Sen. Larry
Pressler, R-S.D., leaning against or solidly opposed to confirming
Tower, and 40 Republicans and two Democrats either leaning for or
supporting confirmation.
   Democrats hold a 55-45 edge in the Senate.
   A partisan squabble kicked off the day as Dole and other
Republicans complained about a decision by Nunn to direct staff from
a separate subcommittee that he heads to investigate new allegations
of excessive drinking against Tower.
   ``We are disturbed by this partisan unit under the control'' of
Nunn, Dole said. ``... I didn't send out any strike force, Sam Nunn
did.''
   Nunn defended his weekend move, saying the FBI had told him its
agents had completed the probe and he had no other choice but to
send Senate staff. But he said he was dropping the investigation
after White House counsel C. Boyden Gray had assured him the FBI
will look into any new allegations.
   But that was merely a prelude to the fireworks later in the day.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., complained bitterly about comments
Dole made on a network interview program in which he referred to the
``vicious personal attacks'' on Tower, including Hollings' use of
the words ``crocked,'' ``sloshed,'' and ``comatose'' from the FBI
report.
   In turn, Dole bristled at the South Carolina Democrat's use of
the term ``Mr. Alcoholic Abuser,'' in reference to Tower. ``Where's
the vicious attack?'' said the Republican leader.
   Mitchell tried to cut short the debate when he repeated Senate
rules that lawmakers cannot cite excerpts from the FBI report. But
instead he himself got caught up in an angry exchange with Sen.
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., over conclusions drawn from the report.
   Bush repeated his support for Tower and termed the nominee's
pledge to swear off alcohol if confirmed by the Senate as a
``fail-safe guarantee.''
   ``I think he'll measure up to that qualification. Indeed, he has
said he'll never touch another drop of liquor and you'll have 25,000
people in the Pentagon making sure that's true,'' Bush told an
impromptu White House news conference.

<HEAD>Money-Losing Thrift Ordered to Sell $12 Million Rubens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A savings and loan which lost $10 million lost
quarter has been ordered by the state to sell a $12 million painting
bought as office ``furniture'' and hung in the chairman's home.
   CenTrust Savings Bank recently bought ``Portrait of a Man as
Mars,'' by Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens from Sotheby's auction
house, paying a $1.2 million commission in addition to the $12
million purchase price.
   In a March 3 letter, the Florida Office of Comptroller expressed
its displeasure with the purchase and ordered the Miami-based bank
to sell the painting within 30 days.
   The state has not yet heard what CenTrust plans to do about the
order, Wendy Mitchler, a spokeswoman in the thrift supervising
office in Tallahassee, said Tuesday.
   However, she said it was rare for savings institutions to oppose
the comptroller because the office supervises all state-chartered
thrifts.
   Bank Chairman David Paul said neither he nor his thrift did
anything wrong, and called the dispute a ``tempest in a teapot.''
   Alex Hager, the chief of the thrift supervision office, said that
for the bank to hold the masterpiece ``creates the likelihood of an
abnormal risk or loss,'' and called the purchase ``inherently
speculative.''
   Hager's letter said the comptroller's office did not understand
how CenTrust, which has lost money for the past two quarters, could
justify buying the painting.
   He questioned why Paul, who is active in Miami's art circles, was
keeping the painting in his home.
   ``Your letter indicates that the painting, although currently
displayed in your personal residence, was acquired as `furniture and
fixtures of CenTrust and is reflected on the balance sheet as an
asset of the institution,''' Hager wrote.
   Paul said the Rubens is in his home only because new executive
offices in CenTrust Towers have not yet been completed.
   He said the purchase was part of a wise pattern of investing,
noting that the average painting has appreciated 15 percent a year
recently.
   CenTrust, which has assets of $10.2 billion and 68 offices around
Florida, valued its entire art collection at about $20 million. The
comptroller's office has a higher estimate of $30 million.
   ``We have been very careful to put together, with the help of the
curator of Sotheby's, a museum-quality art collection,'' Paul said.
``We're no different than the major banks.''

   A court convicted a man Tuesday
and sentenced him to 10 months in jail for insulting Jews in a

Nazi Holocaust.
   Rainer Graf Adelmann, 40, also was convicted of forming an
``anti-Semitic club.''
   Adelman wrote that Jews killed by the Hitler regime had
themselves to blame because they ``went along with Nazi laws'' and
finally ``voluntarily showed up for their own deportations.''
   Judge Hermann Frank said: ``The Jewish population and the Jewish
race has been insulted and defamed in the worst fashion.''
   Adelmann told the court he had not intended to insult anyone and

   The Soviet Union has begun withdrawing
three-quarters of its troops from Mongolia as promised, including
the entire Soviet air force there, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov announced Tuesday.
   He did not tell reporters when the pullout would be completed or
how many troops were involved.
   Mongolia lies between China and the Soviet Union. Beijing says
removal of Soviet troops from the region is a necessary step to
improving relations between the two communist giants. President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is to travel to Beijing on May 15 for the first
Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   Gorbachev announced the withdrawals from Mongolia on Jan. 18.
   Moscow began withdrawing its troops from Mongolia in 1987, but
did not say how many were there. Western analysts estimated the size
of the Soviet force at 40,000 to 60,000 troops before withdrawals.
   The Soviet Union also is withdrawing troops from Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
   Jacob Kossman, a lawyer regarded by court
friends as a legal genius whose list of clients included prominent
mob figures Angelo Bruno and Albert Anastasia, has died at age 79.
   Kossman died Sunday at the Fox Chase Cancer Center.
   Among those he represented were James Hoffa, the late president
of the Teamsters Union; Anastasia, the former head of what was known
as Murder Inc.; and Bruno, the Philadelphia mob boss who dined with
Kossman the night Bruno was gunned down in front of his home.
   Kossman ``was the Albert Einstein of the courtroom,'' said
Jeffrey Miller, a former assistant U.S. attorney who rented office
space from the lawyer. ``He didn't dress like a lawyer, didn't talk
down to juries.''
   Friends said Kossman never argued about the innocence of his
clients, but he insisted they were entitled to the best defense
possible under the Constitution.
   ``If he didn't win his verdict with the jury, he'd win it on
appeal,'' said Carmen Nasuti, a former assistant U.S. attorney who
worked against Kossman as a prosecutor and later with him as a
defense attorney.
   ``He had a way of analyzing things that was phenomenal,'' said
Nasuti. ``His mind could analyze through the toughest problem.''
   Survivors include his wife, Dr. Estelle Gold; a stepdaughter and
stepson, and two sisters.

<HEAD>Spokesman Says Evidence `Indicates' Soviets Killed Polish Officers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has concluded that
``everything indicates'' that more than 4,000 Polish army officers
massacred at Katyn were killed not by the Nazis but by Soviet secret
police, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   Chief government spokesman Jerzy Urban said, however, the
evidence is circumstantial, and Poland continues to press for speed
in the Soviet review of one of the most emotional blank spots in
Soviet-Polish history.
   It was the strongest government statement yet pointing to Soviet
culpability, although an official newspaper last month published a
wartime Polish Red Cross report indicating the officers were killed
on Soviet territory well before the 1941 Nazi invasion of the Soviet
Union.
   Urban has said the inscription on a monument in Warsaw blaming
the Nazis will be changed.
   ``We think that everything indicates that the crime was committed
by the Stalinist NKVD,'' the secret police force that preceded the
KGB, Urban said.
   ``The Soviet historians are analyzing this material and are right
to state that it's only circumstantial evidence.''
   The officers had been deported to the Soviet Union. Hitler's army
uncovered their bodies in spring 1943 in the Katyn forest, 12 miles
west of Smolensk in the western Soviet Union.
   Official Soviet and Polish histories long held the officers were
killed by the Nazis in 1941, but many Poles and Western historians
blamed the Soviets.
   Poland and the Soviet Union formed a joint commission in 1987 to
consider the evidence on Katyn and other historical questions. The
Polish side has submitted its material and indications have emerged
of growing impatience with the Soviet review.
   Urban said Poland understands the Soviets want to review material
in their own archives but ``we are for speeding up the process of
looking for them.''
   Poland was attacked first by the Nazis from the west and then
from the east by the Soviet Union in September 1939. Many Poles and
Western historians say the Soviets killed the Polish officers in the
spring of 1940, when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were still
observing a non-aggression pact.

   Actor Ben Vereen, honored Tuesday with
columnist Ann Landers and country music singer Tammy Wynette,
pledged to continue the fight ``to free America from its chains of
drugs and mental illness.''
   The three celebrities were honored by mental health groups for
their efforts to build public awareness on the issues of mental
illness and addictions and remove the social stigma from these
disorders.
   ``I'm not proud of the fact that I once had a drug problem, but I
am proud I did something about it,'' Ms. Wynette, who overcame
dependency on prescription drugs, said at an awards reception on
Capitol Hill.
   Vereen, a national spokesman for the campaign for ``A Drug Free
America,'' said programs must use education to reach parents, school
leaders and teachers about how to spot mental illnesses such as
depression that can lead to drug abuse. Then, they must reach out
with compassion to those afflicted.
   ``What we have to do is ... open our arms and say we know how
what you're feeling and tell them there are people who care,''
Vereen said.
   Ms. Landers urged: ``Let's be sympathetic, let's be kind, let's
be caring and let's recognize the burden these people who have
mental illness are carrying. I can't tell you how much pain, how
much suffering is out there.''
   The ``From Shame to Hope'' awards were co-sponsored by the Mental
Health Liaison Group, the Alcohol and Drug Problems Association of
North America and the Mental Illness Research Advocacy Coalition _
Learning and Educating.
   The groups stressed the need for more information on mental
illnesses and drug and alcohol addictions, and praised the Alcohol,
Drug Abuse and Mental Illness Administration, which leads the
federal government's research efforts on mental and addictive
disorders.

<TEXT>
   The Appeals Court ordered on Tuesday
that reggae singer Bob Marley's estate be sold for $8.6 million to
the New York-based recording company Island Logic.
   Marley's widow, reggae singer Rita Marley, and lawyers for his 11
children had argued that the price was too low and appealed earlier
approval of the sale by the estate's administrator, a Kingston bank.
   Marley, 36, died of cancer in May 1981 in a Miami hospital
without leaving a will.
   Judge Ira Rowe upheld the sale and ordered that Island Logic pay
for the estate at once and not over a 10-year period as proposed
originally.
   Assets include Marley's song catalogs valued at $5.3 million, $3
million in recording royalties and record distribution rights,
recording equipment, and real estate in Jamaica.
   Marley was survived by his mother, his wife and their four
children, and seven other children born to seven different women.
   On Feb. 22, his four children by his wife, who perform as Ziggy
Marley and the Melody Makers, won the reggae music section of the
Grammy awards in Los Angeles with their album ``Conscious Party.''

<HEAD>Sandinistas and Rebels Accuse Each Other of Cease-Fire Violations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government and
Nicaraguan rebels on Tuesday accused each other of scores of
violations since Jan. 1 of the year-old cease-fire.
   The Defense Ministry said the rebels, known as Contras, had fired
upon Nicaraguan troops and civilians on 140 occasions since Jan. 1.
   In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, the rebels' Nicaraguan Resistance
organization said Sandinista troops fired on its forces 69 times
during January and February.
   Defense Ministry spokeswoman Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos denied the
Resistance allegations and said the rebel attacks were ``an open
violation of the cease-fire.''
   ``We completely respect the cease-fire, but if the Contras attack
we have to defend ourselves,'' she told The Associated Press. She
said none of the rebel attacks was ``of great scope.''
   The leftist Sandinistas and the U.S.-backed rebels reached a
provisional cease-fire agreement in March 1988, but talks on a
permanent truce to the 8-year-old civil war stalled in September.
   Since June the government has extended a unilateral cease-fire on
a monthly basis that has been tacitly accepted by the rebels.
   An estimaed 11,000 Contra guerrillas fled to Honduras after U.S.
military assistance expired in February 1988. They have drawn from
$27 million in U.S. humanitarian aid that is to expire at the end of
this month.
   Col. Pasos said ``small, dispersed Contra groups that have lost
social support and are desperate because of the scant supplies they
receive'' were responsibile for the attacks this year.
   A statement released by the Sandinista army listed what it said
were recent cease-fire violations by the rebels. It gave this
account:
   On Sunday rebels fired into the village of San Jose, 190 miles
east of Managua, killing three peasants, including two who belonged
to a civilian militia. The day before rebels stopped a truck at La
Pinnuela, 175 miles east of the capital, and robbed the people
aboard the vehicle.
   On March 1, two people were killed when about 40 rebels fired on
a small boat carrying passengers on the Escondido River near Salto
Hamaca, 195 miles east of Managua.
   The Nicaraguan Resistance report accusing the Sandinistas of
cease-fire violations said that on Feb. 20 Rafael Ramos Herrera, a
rebel officer known as Commander Nelson, was killed in an ambush by
government troops in Zelaya province.
   ``All of these Sandinista attacks that constitute a frank
violation of the cease-fire declared by the Nicaraguan regime have
been denounced to the United Nations and the Organization of
American States,'' the report said.

   A 19-year-old Navy recruit died during training
last year because he was intimidated, because the service neglected
safety procedures and because higher-ups pressured the facility to
turn out more graduates, congressional investigators said Tuesday.
   And the General Accounting Office said the recruit, Lee Mirecki
of Appleton, Wis., was not the only sailor to die from such lapses
in Navy training schools around the country over the last two years.
   Investigators said safety problems contributed to five of 16
deaths in Navy training programs 1986 and 1987. The GAO said some of
the flaws have still not been corrected.
   Mirecki, the agency said, had panicked during a swimming-pool
drill known as ``sharks and daisies,'' in which swimmers must free
themselves from an instructor who simulates a drowning person and
grabs the recruit from behind.
   Mirecki was counseled, given a medical examination and found
``not physically qualified'' for the course because of a phobia of
being held under water.
   Despite the findings, he was enrolled in the class a second time
and forced into the pool again.
   The GAO said Mirecki left the pool and clutched an equipment
rack, shouting ``I quit'' and ``please don't put me back in the
water.''
   But instructors dragged him back to the pool. He struggled and
was eventually pulled out unconscious but could not be revived.
   An autopsy led authorities to believe Mirecki died of heartbeat
irregularity caused by extreme fear, fatigue and insufficient oxygen.
   The school's lead instructor was found guilty by a general
court-martial of negligent homicide, demoted and confined for 90
days. Eight others associated with the class were given
administrative punishments, including demotions and reprimands.
   Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., who requested the investigtion along with
other members of the state's congressional delegation, called
Mirecki's death ``a tragedy waiting to happen.''
   ``This GAO report is a catalog of failures by the Navy, which led
to Lee Mirecki's death and others,'' Roth told a news conference.
   He vowed to see that the remaining problems are resolved and
asked Vice Admiral John Disher, head of the service's training
system, to contact families of recruits who died in training ``to
tell them what really happened.''
   The GAO said it had discussed its findings with the Navy and
reported that officials ``generally agreed'' and ``were receptive to
suggestions on how to improve training safety and death and mishap
investigations.''
   Roth said he believed the Navy initially covered up the reason
for Mirecki's death, thinking ``this would go away like so many
other cases in the past.'' But the persistence of Mirecki's family
and classmates, Roth said, brought the truth to light.
   The GAO said that some improvements have been made at the school:
The ``sharks and daisies'' drill has been dropped; instructors are
better trained; safety equipment is kept by the swimming pool, and
there is a clearer policy regarding students' rights to drop out of
a course.
   But the GAO said that there remains great pressure on students
not to drop out of a course because it is made clear to them that
doing so will adversely affect their careers, and that there still
is no system to alert instructors to students with a history of
problems.
   ``The bottom line,'' Roth said, ``is that Navy instructors still
are not trained to conduct high-risk training and that students
still are not screened to make sure they can handle the dangers.''
   In Mirecki's case, Roth pointed to GAO findings that he had
untrained and unsupervised instructors and was prevented from
dropping out because of pressure on the school to increase the
number of graduates it turned out.
   The GAO also faulted the Navy for its investigation of Mirecki's
death and said the service doesn't always investigate such deaths as
thoroughly as it should.
   In addition, the investigators wrote that ``the ability of these
investigations as presently conducted to identify and address safety
issues is questionable.''

   An aide to Gov. Buddy Roemer raised hopes
Tuesday for a compromise in a 15-year-old federal desegregation
lawsuit against Louisiana's colleges and universities.
   The court-appointed special master overseeing the integration
effort had scheduled a morning hearing but called off the session
after meeting with lawyers. Attorneys were to meet with him
Wednesday in private, a secretary said.
   John Kennedy, counsel to Roemer, and state Sen. William
Jefferson, attorney for the Southern University System, said earlier
Tuesday that lawyers in the case were getting closer to a
settlement. But neither would give details or predict that a
settlement would be reached.
   Nor could they be reached later for comment. Calls to their
offices and hotels were not returned.
   Asked about speculation that a proposed settlement had been drawn
up, John Keller, chairman of the Board of Regents, said, ``I would
be pretty sure they've gotten pretty far. But not sure they have
gotten that far.''
   Thomas Todd, a lawyer representing Grambling State University
alumni, said the delay did not mean that settlement was imminent.
   ``There's nothing to be read into this. Negotiations are always
continuing. They never stop. But there are a lot of technical things
that have got to be done in conjunction with a hearing like this,''
said Todd. ``One of those is negotiation.''
   The U.S. Justice Department filed the lawsuit against the
Lousiana system in 1974.
   Louisiana, the Justice Department, Southern University and the
Grambling State University Alumni Association all have proposals
before special master Paul Verkuil, appointed by a three-judge
federal panel to supervise desegregation of Louisiana's 13 state
universities and six two-year colleges.
   Grambling, as one of the nine schools run by the Board of
Trustees for State Colleges and Universities, backs the state's
plan. But its alumni association, like Southern, objects to what it
sees as moves that would eliminate traditionally black schools and
deprive underprivileged black youngsters of the help they need to
adapt to college life and courses.
   Those moves include a keystone of the state's plan: consolidating
the boards that govern Southern, the Louisiana State University
system and nine regional colleges _ and the board that oversees
those three boards _ into one ``superboard.''
   Roemer said he would not budge on the superboard issue but might
accept the establishment of weaker, advisory boards without the
power to hire, fire or set budgets.
   The state's plan also calls for a statewide community college
system, which Southern and the Grambling alumni contend would keep
many blacks from ever making it into a four-year university.
   The Justice, Southern and Grambling alumni plans depend heavily
on moving programs from predominantly white schools to schools that
are predominantly black, an arrangement Kennedy says failed in other
states that tried it.
   Verkuil is president of the College of William &amp; Mary in Virginia
and a former dean of Tulane University's law school.

<TEXT>
   A pair of senators introduced legislation
Tuesday to permanently ban cigarette smoking on all domestic
flights, a bill that immediately received the endorsement of Surgeon
General C. Everett Koop.
   The measure would expand the current prohibition against smoking,
which covers flights of two hours or less and is due to expire in
April 1990.
   ``The time has come to protect the health and safety of all
airline passengers,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who
co-sponsored the bill with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   At the senators' news conference to announce the proposal, Koop
said such a ban is ``long overdue.''
   He cited a recent study by the National Cancer Institute which
found that passengers in non-smoking sections of airliners had
similar levels of nicotine in their saliva and urine to travelers in
smoking areas.
   The bill would leave intact the $1,000 fine that can be levied
against those violating the smoking ban, and the $2,000 penalty for
people caught tampering with smoke detectors in airline restrooms.

   Light snow or freezing rain fell from the Gulf Coast to the north
Atlantic Coast as temperatures fell to record lows in Texas and the
Northeast. Mild weather prevailed in the western half of the nation.
   Temperatures dropped to record lows in 15 cities in Texas and the
Northeast.
   The snow fell as far south as New Orleans, but did not accumulate
there. Light snow and freezing drizzle slickened roads around
Birmingham, Ala., and in eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia.
Interstate 59 in Birmingham was closed.
   Advisories for snow or freezing rain were in effect in North
Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania. Light snow
also fell along sections of the north Atlantic Coast and in Michigan.
   Strong winds produced gale warnings along the North Carolina and
mid-Atlantic Coast and coastal flood watches and warnings from the
Delaware coast to North Carolina's Outer Banks.
   Showers and thunderstorms brought heavy rain to southern Florida,
especially the Florida Key. On Big Pine Key, a
thunderstorm-generated tornado damaged awnings, roofs and tree limbs.
   Scattered showers fell across the Intermountain West between the
Sierra Nevadas and the Rockies.
   In Texas, record lows for the date were set in Brownsville (32
degrees), Corpus Christi (28), Houston (28), San Antonio (26),
Victoria (27), Waco (21) and Wichita Falls (11). Records were tied
in College Station and the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where it was 20
degrees.
   In the Northeast, the temperature dropped to a record 2 degrees
in Worcester, Mass., and 3 degrees in Portland, Maine. Records were
also set in Burlington, Vt., Newark, N.J., and Syracuse, N.Y., and
tied in Hartford, Conn.
   But the nation's low was 19 degrees below zero in Caribou, Maine.
Wind chill advisories were in effect in southern Maine and New
Hampshire.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 4
degrees below zero at Burlington to 86 degrees at Santee, Calif.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for light snow in sections of
the mid-Atlantic Coast states, rain or snow in eastern North
Carolina and rain, with snow in higher elevations, from the northern
and central Pacific Coast to the northern Rockies and eastern
Montana.
   Temperatures were expected to climb into the 20s and 30s from the
Great Lakes to the northern and middle Atlantic Coast states, the
50s and 60s from Florida to the central Gulf Coast, southern and
western sections of the Great Plains and most of the Rockies and
Intermountain West to the northern and central Pacific Coast; the
70s in Southern California and much of New Mexico; and the 80s to
lower 90s in southern Arizona.

   Donna Ashlock, the teen-ager who received a
dead admirer's heart when her own failed, died unexpectedly in her
sleep Tuesday while awaiting a second transplant.
   Ashlock, 17, died around noon at her home in the central
California town of Patterson, said Jim Cullen, a spokesman for
Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco, where the
first transplant was performed.
   ``Her death today comes as a severe shock,'' said Dr. Andrew
Fryer, the girl's pediatric cardiologist.
   ``Donna was seen by us last week, and was in pretty good shape,''
Fryer said at a news conference. He said her condition recently was
``very stable'' and described the girl as being cheerful and in good
spirits.
   Although doctors weren't certain what caused her death, Fryer
suspected cardiac arrhythmia, the irregular beating of the heart.
The arrhythmia probably led to cardiac arrest and sudden death just
three weeks before the girl's 18th birthday, Fryer said.
   Ashlock, who was taking a nap, probably did not awaken, he added.
   Her body had repeatedly tried to reject the heart of 15-year-old
Felipe Garza Jr., which she received after Garza died in January
1986.
   The girl's case drew international attention when it was reported
that Garza, who had a crush on his high school classmate, had told
his parents he wanted to leave her his heart after his death.
   Ashlock's death shocked hospital staff members, said Pacific
Presbyterian spokeswoman Nancy Millhouse.
   ``We're very saddened by it,'' she said. ``There are many people
at this hospital who have gotten close to her over the year. She
turned to the hospital as a place to have friends and get out of the
limelight.''
   Garza, the son of farm laborers who had been suffering from
blackouts and headaches when he talked with his parents about
donating his heart, died suddenly on Jan. 4, 1986 after a blood
vessel burst in his brain.
   ``I hope that what Peno (Felipe) did shows how people can help
each other,'' Ashlock said in a statement 12 days after the
transplant surgery. ``I was surprised when Dad told me about Peno
and what he had done for me. I felt very sad, but thankful for what
he did.''

   Dissident teachers staged another one-day
walkout Tuesday, and the government news agency Notimex said about 5
million children were affected and stayed home from school.
   It was the third walkout in a month by the dissidents, who are
demanding pay increases and the removal of the head of the National
Teachers Union, Carlos Jongitud Barrios.
   An estimated 50,000 teachers joined a march in downtown Mexico
City that snarled traffic.
   The government condemned the strike late Tuesday in a statement
released by the Education Department, saying the walkouts
``constitute illegal actions that are contrary to the public
interest.''
   ``The damage suffered by students is irreversible and no one has
the right to injure youth,'' it added.
   The government offered to consider teachers' grievances through
dialogue.
   Virtually all public schools in Mexico City were closed. Notimex
reported scattered walkouts at schools nationwide, with dissident
teachers from at least 17 states participating in the march in the
capital. Mexico has 32 states and the federal district of Mexico
City.
   Many of the teachers in the march had pay stubs pinned to their
clothing. Teachers make an average $170 a month, and the dissidents
are seeking a 100 per cent pay raise. Mexico's minimum monthly wage
is about $75.
   ``We barely earn more than common laborers, those who sweep
floors, but we have to have a lot more education'' secondary-school
teacher Ricardo Pena told The Associated Press.
   Marching were members of the National Schoolteachers Coordinate,
a faction opposed to the National Teachers Union, which represents
about 1.2 million teachers and education workers.
   The dissidents claim Jongitud has used his 17 years as union
leader to gain power and wealth while ignoring the plight of the
teachers.
   ``A E I O U! Out With Jongitud!'' the marchers chanted .
   One large banner showed Jongitud riding a stick horse labeled
``PRI,'' the initials of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, which counts on organized labor as one of it strongest
supporters.
   Jongitud is closely allied with the PRI and is now the senator
from San Luis Potosi state.
   The dissidents claim leaders of the national union sell teaching
jobs for about $2,100 each.
   The government does not recognize the National Schoolteachers
Coordinate.

   Prosecutors on Wednesday arrested a former vice

   Takashi Kato, 58, became the highest-ranking public official to
be arrested in the unfolding scandal after Shigeru Kano, former head
of the Labor Ministry's employment service division, who was taken
in Feb. 17.
   Also Wednesday, Masao Tatsumi, former executive of Recruit Co.,
an employment-information conglomerate, was apprehended by
prosecutors on charges of bribing Kato. That brought to 11 the total
number of scandal-related arrests to date.
   Two Recruit officials who were arrested Feb. 15 were freed
Tuesday by the Tokyo District Prosecutor's Office. The office has
yet to decide whether they will be indicted.
   Recruit is at the center of the scandal in which a select number
of individuals, particularly politicians, were offered the
opportunity to purchase bargain-priced shares of a real estate
subsidiary up until September 1986.
   When the shares were offered for over-the-counter trading in
October 1986, their value rose substantially and holders were able
to earn hefty profits.
   Kato's arrest had been expected for weeks. Prosecutors had been
questioning him over the past few days over his ties to Recruit.
   Kato allegedly purchased 3,000 unlisted shares in a
Recruit-Cosmos subsidiary in September 1986 and earned a windfall of
about $53,000 a month later, Kyodo News Service quoted prosecutors
as saying.
   The former vice labor minister, who retired voluntarily in
January 1988, has been accused of providing special favors to
Recruit during his 1983-85 tenure as director general of the
ministry's Employment Services Bureau, Kyodo said.
   On Monday, Higashi Shinto, former head of Japan's largest
corporation, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, was arrested on charges
of accepting bribes from Recruit.
   The Recruit scandal has severely damaged the reputation of Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, whose support rating has dwindled to 21.3
percent in the latest poll by the mass circulation daily Yomiuri
Shimbun.
   Three Cabinet ministers resigned after reports that they directly
or indirectly purchased Recruit stock. Takeshita has denied personal
involvement in the scandal but has acknowledged his own aide bought
2,000 shares of Recruit stock.

   Road crews plowed and pedestrians trudged through the slushy
remains of a snowstorm that canceled a presidential visit Tuesday in
the Northeast, disrupted Missouri's Legislature for a second day and
caused a 20-mile backup in Texas.
   ``It's history now,'' meteorologist Ray Williams of the National
Weather Service in Paducah, Ky., said of the storm blamed for 29
deaths. ``Fortunately it's March and it will start turning back to
warmer weather.''
   Before the storm moved from the Midwest across the Eastern
Seaboard, it tangled the morning rush hour in Baltimore and
Washington and knocked out electricity to 40,000 customers at
Annapolis, Md., and along the Eastern Shore from Georgetown, Del.,
to Salisbury, Md., and thousands more in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
   Utility workers battled ice, strong winds and frigid temperatures
to restore power lines. Schools closed in several states.
   In Oklahoma, where up to 16 inches of snow fell, a 61-year-old
woman who went outside to get wood for her stove apparently froze to
death as temperatures dipped into the teens Tuesday, police said.
   ``She went out to get the wood in her house coat and socks and
she fell and passed out'' 40 yards from her front door, said Tulsa
Sgt. Dick Bishop.
   In Locust Grove, Okla., a pregnant woman and her husband had to
wade through waist-deep snow when their truck got stuck in snow on
the way to the hospital. The baby was delivered by a paramedic in a
nearby house.
   Forecasters in Oklahoma, however, predicted a sudden rise in
temperatures as high as the 80s later this week. In southern
Illinois, where winds of 15 mph made temperatures in the low 30s
seem like 5 to 10 degrees, highs were expected to reach the 60s by
Saturday.
   A backup on Interstate 35 in northern Texas prompted about 100
truck drivers to park their rigs in Marietta, Okla., Police Chief
Charles Dunn said. About half needed tow trucks to get on their way
again Tuesday, he said.
   At least 450 stranded motorists spent the night in churches,
homes and a high school in the tiny town of Valley View, Texas,
where their plight elicited gifts of food, blankets and cots from
many of the 514 residents.
   ``I've never seen an outpouring of kindness like this,'' said one
of the motorists, Donny Rohrbach from San Antonio, who spent the
night in a pew.
   Sgt. Thomas Lefaivre of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said
the main roads in the St. Louis area were open, ``but traffic was
very heavy. The secondary roads are going to remain covered until it
gets a lot warmer.''
   President Bush canceled a trip to Lancaster, Pa., and Wilmington,
Del. The Missouri Legislature, which called off its session the day
before, was delayed several hours Tuesday morning.
   Snowfall since the weekend accumulated to a foot or more along a
swath from Ardmore, Okla., into Missouri, with 10 inches in Decatur,
Ill., and up to a foot in northern Arkansas, where the collapse of
280 poultry houses left up to $35 million in damage and dead birds.
   Snow flurries and freezing drizzle were reported Tuesday morning
as far south as Mobile, Ala.
   Because of dangerous driving conditions, some schools closed in
Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington,
D.C. Southern Illinois University-Carbondale shut its doors for only
the third time in a decade.
   Rain caused flooding across southern West Virginia, closing roads
in 14 counties. In Tennessee, about 120 families were forced to
evacuate from along the swollen Cumberland and Harpeth rivers.
   In Pennsylvania, the Monongahela River crested at 6.3 feet above
flood stage Tuesday morning at Charleroi and also overflowed at
Braddock, Elizabeth and McKeesport. ``There is some damage at these
levels, most often to warehouses or storage areas along the river
and roads,'' said weather service hydrologist Aldo Angelo.
   Weather-related deaths included 12 in Missouri, seven in
Oklahoma, three in Maryland, two each in Alabama and Ohio, and one
each in Arkansas, Georgia and Pennsylvania.

   Aviation security has improved, but federal
agents still managed to slip 156 weapons through airport security
resulting in $1.18 million in fines against domestic airlines, the
Federal Aviation Administration announced.
   The agency said the weapon detection rate for all airlines
checked was 93.1 percent, compared to 88.2 percent in July 1988 and
78.9 percent in the first such tests of the system in 1987.
   In a separate Transportation Department report Monday, airlines
showed improvements in the number of flight delays, baggage problems
and passengers with reservations who were ``bumped'' off flights.

   Iran today severed diplomatic relations
with Britain and accused it of anti-Islamic ``treachery'' for
refusing to denounce Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses''
and lift its diplomatic embargo.
   Iran's parliament had given Britain one week to ``clarify'' its
stance on the book, which many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   Britain withdrew all its diplomats from Iran after Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, in a religious edict issued Feb. 14, called on
Moslems to seek out and kill Rushdie for insulting Islam.
   Iranian clerics subsequently offered a bounty of $5.2 million for
the author, a British citizen born to a Moslem family in India.
Rushdie, 41, went into hiding with his wife and is reportedly under
police guard.

   Republicans are heartened by Democrat Howell
Heflin's decision to vote for John Tower as defense secretary and
say they may yet ask the Senate to let the nominee defend his

   Heflin said the FBI had not built a persuasive case against Tower
and said he is convinced the nominee would not break his pledge
never to drink again if confirmed as the nation's defense chief. He
said Tower is qualified for the job by reason of background and
expertise in military affairs.
   But the encouragement GOP leaders drew from Heflin's announcement
on Tuesday was dampened when another Southern Democrat _ Sen. David
Pryor of Arkansas _ said he would vote ``no.''
   ``I feel this man is going to create rather than solve

   Communist rebels have established a
shadow government and are collecting taxes in this northern town
named for the family of Ferdinand Marcos _ a fierce anti-Communist
during his 20-year rule.
   Local military and civilian officials say this town of 12,000
people that is 230 miles north of Manila became a rebel stronghold
after the former president fled to Hawaii in the 1986
military-civilian uprising that propelled Corazon Aquino to power.
   ``In the time of Marcos, they were only in the mountains,'' Mayor
Felicito Tamayo said of the rebel New People's Army. ``Now they have
been able to reverse that. It's as if the timing was great _
Communists entering and Marcos leaving.''
   Marcos town is about 10 miles south of Sarrat, where the former
president was born 71 years ago. The town's 13 outlying hamlets,
most named for members of Marcos' family, have become gateways for
guerrillas to slip down from the mountains into populous areas of
Ilocos Norte province.

<HEAD>Peru Seeks to Overcome Effects of Failed Land Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANETE, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though the ancient Incas thrived on this
Andean nation's stingy soil, Peru today has farming woes that drain
its funds and leave it short of food.
   Analysts say the major culprit is a land reform program, South
America's largest, that has failed to keep modern Peru's feeble farm
production growing at the same pace as the population.
   ``Agriculture was mortally wounded by the agrarian program,''
Peru's leading newspaper El Comercio said in a recent editorial
bemoaning the 20th anniversary of the event.
   Many people think the spreading chaos in Peru _ marked by the
flight of hundreds of thousands of highland peasants to city slums,
a deep economic recession and a leftist guerrilla insurgency _ has
been aggravated by the failure of land reform.
   Politicians and agronomists alike are frantically seeking
solutions and they hope recent legislation will help.
   The issue is reflected by ``The Castle,'' an ornate mansion on a
former cotton barron's estate. It sits like a fading symbol on the
outskirts of Canete, an oasis town on the desert coast 100 miles
south of Lima, the capital.
   Like hundreds of other large farms, the estate's 1,500 acres were
expropriated and organized into a cooperative for the 100 peasant
families who had worked the land as virtual serfs.
   Today The Castle lies abandoned and deteriorating, much like the
agrarian reform instituted by the leftist military ruler at the
time, Gen. Juan Velasco.
   But its surrounding fertile farmlands have begun to reflect their
former glory since the government allowed the cooperatives to be
divided up among their members.
   ``Under Velasco we all made good money, but no one wanted to
work,'' said Jubilio Ensiso, 42, one of The Castle's farmers.
``They'd spend just four or six hours in the fields.
   ``Now we put in twice that because we are working for ourselves.''
   He farms 11 acres of corn, cotton and pumpkins.
   Velasco's land reform program sought to break the aristocracy's
grip over the countryside. His aim was to distribute income and
increase farm output.
   About 22 million acres were redistributed, more land than in any
reform program outside of Cuba.
   Productivity suffered as peasants with no management experience
took control. Analysts say the program eventually failed in a morass
of inefficiency due to poor planning and execution.
   Fewer than 20 percent of Peru's landless peasants actually
received land, according to the Institute for Peruvian Studies, a
private social research center.
   Since the program began in 1969, farm output has grown slightly
more than 1 percent yearly, while the population grew by 2.5 percent
a year.
   As a result successive governments have had to increase imports
of food staples. The 1988 foreign grocery bill reached $600 million,
one-quarter of Peru's export earnings.
   The problem was aggravated when the debt-strapped government of
President Alan Garcia late last year ran low of foreign currency to
pay for the imports.
   Sporadic shortages of wheat, dried milk and other staples have
plagued Peru since then, and the government has asked other nations
for emergency food.
   Modern farming woes contrast sharply with the success of the
Incas, who routinely had a surplus after feeding a population
estimated at more than half of Peru's current 21 million.
   Though the Spanish destroyed the Incas' highly organized society,
some of their agricultural expertise, including desert irrigation
canals and mountain terraces, is still widely applied by Peruvian
peasants today.
   ``The Incas were probably the best agronomists in the world. They
had to be to survive,'' said Marc Dourojeanni, a professor at Lima's
National Agrarian University.
   Dourojeanni says just 3 percent of Peru, which is roughly the
size of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico combined, is suitable for
cultivation.
   Five years ago the government drastically modified the failing
reform program and began allowing cooperatives to cut their lands
into parcels, with equal sections going to members to reap whatever
profits they could.
   Farmer Ensiso says output since then at the former cotton estate
here has grown about 20 percent since then, a figure he says is
generally true of other cooperatives that divided up their lands.
   Peru's total farm production rose 7 percent in 1988, compared
with a 9 percent decline in the economy as a whole.
   Specialists say the agricultural troubles are far from resolved
but agree the modifications in land reform are helping.

<HEAD>Israelis in Egypt Keep Low Profile 10 Years after Peace Pact</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Despite 10 years of peace, Israelis living
in Egypt still face resentment and are forced to keep a low profile
for reasons of politics and security.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, on a rare trip to Egypt by a senior
Israeli official, tried to raise Israeli visibility recently by
visiting this state-owned farm where Israeli experts are involved in
an irrigation project.
   ``This project is a big success,'' Arens said, ``and being a big
success it will become well known.''
   The project was started in 1986 but was kept quiet until the
foreign minister came with a busload of journalists.
   Egypt's agriculture minister, Yussef Wali, noted that while the
project had not been publicized in Egyptian media it is highly
visible to Egyptians because it is about 60 miles north of Cairo on
a main highway to Alexandria on the Mediterranean.
   ``It is seen by thousands of people, and this is real publicity
for the project,'' Wali said.
   The farm, however, has no sign to show that Israeli experts are
there watching over such crops as chilis, sweet peppers, tomatoes
and cucumbers.
   A large green-and-white billboard, however, announces Saudi
Arabian cooperation in other aspects of the farm.
   Mark Zuk, 38, one of a half-dozen Israeli agriculture advisers
here, said he had no specific instructions to hide his presence. But
he added that political events sometimes made the atmosphere tense
and he avoids sensitive topics. One such topic is the 15-month
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where Israeli soldiers have killed more than 390 Arabs.
   ``We never talk about political subjects,'' Zuk said. ``They
don't bring it up and neither do I. I feel comfortable with the
people I am working with and don't feel any rejection.''
   Thousands of Israeli tourists have visited Egypt since Israel
signed the peace treaty March 26, 1979, that ended three decades of
war. About 100 Israeli Embassy staff members and their families now
live in Cairo, but only about a dozen non-official Israelis work in
Egypt on a full-time basis.
   Ovadia Keidar, 48, an Israeli agronomist who lives in Cairo with
his wife and three of his five children, said the relationship
between Israelis and Egyptians remains tentative, complex and often
emotional.
   ``The peace agreement is not something that you can switch on and
off. You make the peace gradually, breaking through one barrier and
then another. I believe that peace will survive the occasional ups
and down. What we have to do is understand each other.''
   Keidar was born in Egypt, speaks Arabic fluently and has a good
knowledge of the country. His family was forced out of Egypt after
the 1956 Suez war, and Keidar became a settler in the Sinai Desert
after it was captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   He then fought as an Israeli soldier on the Egyptian front in the
war of 1973, was uprooted from his Sinai settlement by the 1979
peace agreement and returned to work in Cairo five years ago.
   In the beginning, he said he was afraid for his safety but
eventually decided to stay.
   ``If I couldn't start here who could?'' he said
   Keidar said his battle for acceptance has produced mixed results.
He recalled that when his daughter was 5 years old she was excluded
from the birthday party of her best friend because her friend's
parents didn't want an Israeli in their home.
   ``She was very hurt and sad,'' he said.
   When his daughter turned 6, Keidar had a birthday party in a
restaurant and his daughter's friend attended.
   ``We met the parents there and became friendly,'' he said. ``One
of the parents studied with my cousin.''
   The Keidars now visit the Egyptian family in their home. But the
Egyptian family, who are related by marriage to Palestinians, have
yet to visit the Keidar home.
   ``There are still some barriers because of the Palestinian
problem, but I can understand them,'' said Keidar, adding he
believed relations would remain uneasy with Egypt until there was a
negotiated settlement of the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The low point in Egyptian-Israeli relations came Oct. 5, 1985,
when seven Israeli tourists were killed when an Egyptian policeman
opened fire on a beach party at Ras Bourka in the Sinai. The
policeman, Suleiman Khatir, was sentenced to life in prison. He died
in jail as a result of what authorities said was a suicide.
   Earlier the same year, an Israeli Embassy employee, Albert
Atrakchi, 30, was assassinated by a gunman in Cairo.
   The only resident Israeli correspondent in Egypt, Yoram Mizrachi
of the liberal newspaper Haaretz, moves frequently to avoid being
targeted after the Egyptian weekly Al Ahali described him as a
dangerous man and published his address.
   Other Israelis, he said, use bodyguards because of resentment
among Egyptians.
   Mizrachi, who has been in Egypt about six months, recalled that
Egyptian journalists once demanded he leave a news conference.
   ``One of them called out that there was an Israeli present, and
they would not participate if I did. So I left.''
   Mizrachi said, however, he was able to move freely to cover the
news, visiting neighborhoods throughout Cairo and even the
Palestinian Liberation Organization.
   A former commander of Israeli troops in south Lebanon, Mizrachi
recently interviewed PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, risking censure and
possible prosecution at home for dealing with the outlawed group.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As ``Baby M'' turns 3 this month, the
controversy that surrounded her birth to a surrogate mother has
diminished little.
   More than 60 bills have been introduced in state legislatures and
three in Congress to ban, regulate or study surrogacy since the
March 27, 1986, birth to Mary Beth Whitehead of the little girl she
was paid $10,000 to carry.
   Melissa, as Baby M now is named, lives with William and Elizabeth
Stern in Tenafly, with one six-hour visit a week from her biological
mother. Her parents won't talk about the case, their daughter, or
the woman who bore her and is now engaged in a 22-city promotional
tour for her book, ``A Mother's Story.''
   ``I really thought this was something special,'' said Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould, now married to Dean Gould, whose child _ her fifth
_ she is expecting in July. ``I really thought it was a way for an
empty-armed couple to have a child.''
   ``I really was naive,'' she said recently. She criticized the
clinic where she was inseminated with Stern's sperm for inadequately
explaining the process and how she might feel, but realizes she
should have asked more questions.
   ``I thought it was something so wonderful. You don't think of the
bad. ... I didn't want to hurt the Sterns. It was very hard to tell
them, `No, you can't have the baby''' she named Sara _ the name on
the birth certificate. Mrs. Whitehead-Gould returned the $10,000 to
Stern.
   The case ``alerted the public to in vitro research,'' said Robert
D. Arenstein, a New York lawyer for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould who has
been working for the past year with the Washington-based National
Coalition Against Surrogacy.
   ``You just can't take somebody's baby away from them. All these
things had never been addressed in a contract,'' Arenstein said.
   The coalition sees surrogacy as ``a creation of tragedy,'' said
its lawyer, Andrew Kimbrell. The group was established partly to
provide low-cost legal aid to women involved in surrogacy contracts
and as a support network for them.
   Among supporters of surrogacy is Gary N. Skoloff, a lawyer for
Stern.
   ``One out of seven married couples in the United States are
infertile,'' Skoloff said. ``Since medical science has now figured
out a way for a couple to have a child through artificial
insemination, it ought to be legalized but be well-regulated.
   ``If adoption can be well-regulated then surrogacy can be
well-regulated.''
   The New Jersey Supreme Court, while awarding custody of Baby M to
William Stern, last year outlawed surrogacy for pay in the state.
State Sen. Catherine Costa has introduced a bill to regulate
arrangements for surrogacy contracts.
   Louisiana, Nebraska and Kentucky have declared surrogacy
contracts void and unenforceable. Michigan also assesses criminal
penalties for paid surrogacy. An Indiana law prohibits the state
from enforcing a surrogacy contract. In Florida surrogacy-for-hire
is illegal, but a woman can voluntarily bear a child for someone
else and be reimbursed for medical and some living expenses.
   At least three bills have been introduced in Congress to ban
surrogacy, to prohibit federal enforcement of the contracts and to
bar use of federal money to help veterans get children through
surrogacy.
   The American Bar Association, without endorsing surrogate
motherhood, last month offered a blueprint for legalizing surrogacy.
It suggested that contracts be limited to married couples and a
surrogate mother who would have 180 days to change her mind after
conception. A judge would have to approve the pact before
conception, and the egg or the sperm would have to come from the
couple.
   Skoloff believes surrogacy will be debated until it's legalized
in three or four states where all couples will go. ``The whole idea
is to protect kids, and having no statute is giving them the least
amount of protection,'' he said.
   ``A Mother's Story,'' written with investigative journalist
Loretta Schwartz-Nobel and published by St. Martin's Press Inc.,
begins with the birth and is limited by court order only to Baby M's
second birthday.
   The Sterns tried to block the book, arguing it would exploit the
child. Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, 31, said she wrote the book so her
daughter would know her side of the story, and to help her other
children cope with the case.
   ``It's pretty much over for me,'' she said. ``But I hope if one
woman reads this, she will think again about her doing it.''

   It's probably the first time during the course of
an interview that the star has been told, ``Get out of the trash!''
   No, the star is not Geraldo Rivera. She is Cinnamon, a red
Doberman pinscher, a rescue dog whose job it is to search through
forests, lakes or earthquake rubble to find people.
   ``The only thing Cinnamon loves more than people is doughnuts,''
notes Cinnamon's owner and trainer, Shirley Hammond, explaining why
Cinnamon keeps dipping her nose into the conference room trash can
seeking the discarded remains of a pastry.
   Cinnamon is one of the dogs taken to Mexico City to help find
victims buried beneath the massive 1985 earthquake.
   And she is among the remarkable working dogs featured in the
National Geographic special, ``Those Wonderful Dogs,'' airing
tonight on PBS.
   ``Those Wonderful Dogs'' is a fascinating and lovingly
photographed film that will please dog-lovers enormously but doesn't
get overly sentimental. It was written and produced by Barbara
Jampel. Richard Kiley provides the narration. The special is
dedicated to the memory of film editor John Dabney, who did such an
excellent job of putting it all together.
   Other dogs featured in the special include sheepdogs, combat
dogs, dogs who assist the disabled and sled dogs.
   The special ranged as far as New Zealand to observe a team of 10
sheepdogs who help one couple manage a huge, remote sheep farm.
``Without the dogs,'' says farmer Grant Calder, ``we'd be broke in
12 months.'' He observes that his dogs are willing to work till they
drop, and all they seek in return is approval from their master.
   There are two different kinds of sheepdogs, the ones who nip at
the heels of the sheep and ``headers,'' who control the sheep from
in front by staring into their eyes. Once the sheep are in the pens,
the dogs run across the backs of the packed herd to move them along.
   The special moves on to Alaska, where Susan Butcher takes the
filmmakers through the training regimen that has produced her
champion sled teams, regular winners of the 1,100-mile Iditarod sled
race.
   One of the most touching segments is set in a more mundane
environment, a typical American home, where lives 17-year-old Mike
Knowlton, a victim of spina bifida who uses a wheelchair, and his
yellow Labrador retriever, Zest.
   Zest is a product of California-based Canine Companions for
Independence. Similar to a Seeing Eye dog, she helps her owner by
pulling his wheelchair, turning off light switches, picking up
dropped objects _ and serving as an ice-breaker. Mike says he used
to be too shy to approach other students at his school, but now they
come up to him to pet the dog.
   If you grew up on ``Lassie,'' Hammond will disappoint you when
she insists that rescue dogs like Cinnamon aren't aware that they
are saving people's lives, but are only playing a hide-and-seek game.
   Hammond is a founder of the California Rescue Dogs Association,
whose members found dozens of survivors beneath the rubble of the
Mexico earthquake. Cinnamon herself was responsible for finding
eight people, Hammond says.
   Cinnamon also searches for people who have wandered into
wilderness areas and become lost. She even locates drowning victims,
riding in a boat and detecting the gases emitted by a body beneath
the water.
   Maybe Cinnamon doesn't know she's saving lives, but she does have
a different signal when she finds a live person _ ``she wags her
behind'' _ than the more subdued scratching at the surface when she
finds a dead person.
   Rescue dogs have to be trained to ignore their natural instinct
to jump off unstable surfaces. They are taught to walk a horizontal
ladder so they become more aware of the position of their hind feet.
   Rescue dogs are selected for their love of all people. Hammond
said many dogs will search all day for their beloved owner, but
don't care about strangers. Hammond said she picked Cinnamon, now
8{, out of litter of pups because she was the one most eager for
human contact. Sure enough, though she had only just met her
``interviewer,'' she happily administered a face-washing.

   Nobody loves to hate people like people
love to hate auto mechanics.
   If your car is broken, you need it fixed right away. But you
sometimes can't get it fixed right away and it costs too much when
it is fixed _ if it was fixed right.
   And you can't really understand what that mechanic is saying
anyway. Is all that gobbledygook just the cover for a rip-off?
   It's all a matter of communication, according to the head of an
award-winning school for auto mechanics, who says communication
skills and ethics are just as important in the curriculum as gaskets
and spark plugs.
   ``One of the most difficult things is to be able to communicate
in a two-way fashion,'' said Richard Diklich, coordinator of the
automobile technology program at Longview Community College.
   ``There is a basic element of distrust on both sides. I've found
that customers often don't want to have their cars fixed because it
is going to be an inconvenience and expensive. So they let it go and
the problem gets worse and it becomes more expensive.''
   The Longview auto tech student spends about two-thirds of the
time working on mechanics and about one-third in liberal arts
classes.
   ``We try to work with the technical student on communication
skills, consumer attitudes, work ethic and attitude as a part of
what we do,'' Diklich said.
   Students study, for example, composition and reading or speech or
American history along with courses on diagnosis and repair of
automotive brake systems.
   Longview this year won the annual competition of the Motor
Vehicle Manufacturer's Association and the American Vocational
Association Industry Planning Council. The school had finished
second in the prestigious competition last year.
   Students enrolled at Longview have the option of following one
program that is closely linked with General Motors, Ford or Toyota.
They get half their training at the school and spend half their time
working in the shop at a manufacturer's dealership. They later find
jobs working for a dealership.
   Students can also get a more general training that qualifies them
to work in other repair shops such as service stations.
   On a tour of the school's new 22,000-square-foot building,
instructor Bill Fairbanks shows off a huge garage with several ports
for cars, the latest in diagnostic equipment, well-equipped
classrooms and well-stocked parts rooms.
   ``They won't find anything out there (in equipment) that we don't
have here,'' said Fairbanks.
   The parking lot at Longview is filled with cars donated to the
school for students to work on, including a late model Cadillac with
the latest in on-board computer technology.
   ``The technology of the car has increased,'' said Diklich. ``The
amount of material we have to teach has more than doubled since the
1970s. But they come from the high school and now have had
experience with computers and with electronics. It is still
basically using diagnostic procedures to find out what is wrong.''
   Demand for qualified mechanics is high, particularly in rural
areas. General Motors estimates a shortage of 125,000 mechanics
qualified to work on its cars.
   ``Training has become more necessary,'' Diklich said. ``The
manufacturers recognize this and they have begun looking to the
colleges and universities for help. The manufacturers can train the
current model technology. But they can't develop the background for
the future.''

<HEAD>MLK's Son, President Of King Center, Picks Up Civil Rights Mantle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The younger son of Martin Luther King Jr. became
heir apparent of a movement when he stood in the pulpit of his
father's church on what would have been the civil rights pioneer's
60th birthday.
   Dexter Scott King declared that he, ``the son of a son of a
movement,'' was ready to take a leadership role. Out rolled the
resonant, vibrant baritone that 25 years earlier prodded blacks to
demand their share of the American Dream.
   For many, it was as if MLK himself had come home.
   But Dexter King is a quiet man with a small circle of friends,
lifts weights at home and prefers tennis and books on nutrition to
politics. He was planted squarely in his father's shoes with a
degree of reluctance.
   ``I was tapped. It was simply an issue of something that was
inevitable,'' he said. ``It surprised a lot of people, including
myself, because it's not the kind of thing that you can readily
prepare for.
   ``I had to come to grips with the fact that this life does not
belong to me, and although all of us like to think that we have a
choice in what our roles will be, I have to think of my father's
role.''
   Dexter King's Jan. 14 appointment as president of The King
Center, aimed at keeping his father's legacy alive, was a relief to
the civil rights community; pressure within the movement for someone
to take up the torch had been heavy.
   When Coretta Scott King made the announcement she pointed out
that Dexter, at 28, is about the same age his father was when he led
bus boycotts in Montgomery, Ala., that sparked the civil rights
movement.
   ``Being the son of the civil rights leader makes Dexter uniquely
qualified to assume the civil rights mantle,'' she said.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, a member of the center's board of
directors and a longtime contemporary of Martin Luther King Jr.,
said Dexter's selection showed ``we are moving forward, carrying on
with another generation.''
   King says he doesn't want to have to fight with his father's
image.
   ``I have never felt like I or anyone else can walk in his shoes.
I can only follow and complement what he's already done. I've never
seen myself as one who just inherited leadership. There are certain
things you just can't inherit.''
   Yet there are things he did inherit, among them the calm, pensive
demeanor that was his father's trademark. Not the speaking style _
that went to younger sister Bernice _ but Dexter King does sound and
look like his dad.
   ``What he did was exclusive to him. I can only be my best self.
And if being my best self means that I achieve great things and
become a great leader, then I will be commended on that basis, ...
but not because people say `You're going to follow in your father's
footsteps.'''
   Larry Carter, dean of the Martin Luther King Jr. International
Chapel at Morehouse College, sees Dexter King as a peaceful man who
will function well as president of the center. ``He seems natural
for that, based on my assessment of his temperament. He's very
polite, he's very considerate.
   ``He's not a rip-roaring orator like his sister Bernice, but he's
capable of passion and has believability.''
   Carter, who has known King for about four years, said he never
knew whether the MLK image was a problem for Dexter King; he never
let it show.
   King, who attended Morehouse _ his father's alma mater _ but has
not graduated, is founder and president of Visionary Development
Corp., a business and development consulting firm. He also directs
the center's office of special events and entertainment and produced
a record marking the first federal King holiday in 1986.
   King said he was first considered for president of The King
Center two years ago, when there was ``some talk amongst the board
members and my mother'' about moving one of the four King children
into a leadership role.
   But Yolanda, 33, serves as the center's producing director of
cultural affairs and runs a theater group with Attallah Shabazz,
daughter of the late Malcolm X; Martin Luther King III, a retiring,
soft-spoken 31-year-old, is a Fulton County commissioner; and
Bernice, 25, is working toward a graduate degree in law and theology
at Emory University in Atlanta.
   ``At that time, I was not specifically targeted,'' King said.
``Recently, ... our immediate family more or less talked about the
fact that my mother is not getting any younger.''
   He explained that the changes, effective April 4 _ the 21st
anniversary of his father's assassination _ would ``free my mother
up and allow us to work as a team.'' King will manage the center's
administrative operations while his mother serves as spokeswoman and
chief executive officer.
   Some of the goals he has set for The King Center include getting
young people excited about a movement they are too young to
remember. He also wants to disseminate the center's message and
non-violent teachings.
   Another primary goal is to get the center on a steady financial
base, he said, with an endowment ``that allows us to
institutionalize our work so that we're not just trying to hang on
day by day or donation by donation.''
   He hopes it won't be too lonely at the top.
   ``I don't know a lot of young national and international leaders,
but I will be thrust into that role. It is lonely, and it is
frustrating because you really want to have people around you who
can really understand where you're coming from.''

   Housing discrimination against families with
children is illegal starting Sunday, but no-kids communities are
fighting to protect their lifestyles even as experts laud the new
law for addressing a national crisis.
   ``There will be resistance (and) claims of reverse
discrimination, but the fact of the matter is Congress has decided
families with children have a great need for housing and this law is
designed to help them,'' said Jim Morales, staff attorney for the
San Francisco-based National Center for Youth Law.
   A 1980 Department of Housing and Urban Development study found
that 75 percent of rental units nationwide banned or restricted
children. Other surveys found 90 percent of apartment complexes in
some communities closed to children.
   ``We just found an epidemic of discrimination against families
with children all over the United States. It was really tragic,''
said U.S. Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., a co-sponsor of the Fair
Housing Amendments Act of 1988 signed into law by President Reagan
in September.
   The act bans discrimination against families with children, with
some exemptions, and adds the handicapped to housing law prohibiting
discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, national origin, color
and race.
   ``Blatant and legal cases of discrimination against families with
children ... (are) happening all over the country and in all types
of communities,'' said Lisa Mihaly of the Washington-based
Children's Defense Fund.
   _In Zephyrhills, Fla., Beverly and Thomas Elmer were forced in
January to evict their 14-year-old daughter Staci rather than go to
jail for contempt of court in a dispute over deed restrictions. She
can visit their mobile home in a subdivision of 17 families north of
Tampa, but must live with a married brother until she turns 15 next
month. Pets are allowed, but not children under 15.
   ``I'm not surprised. The Constitution isn't made for kids,''
Staci said.
   _In Margate, Fla., Jamie Swartz, 9, was threatened with eviction
when she moved in with her father and stepmother after her mother
died. After months of uncertainty, Jamie got a reprieve in January
when the condominium board decided not to take action while the new
federal housing act was researched.
   _A Portland, Ore., couple were forced to send their 3-year-old
son to live with friends because of a dispute with neighbors at
apartments that had been converted into condominiums with a
no-children rule.
   ``Of course we couldn't just banish him into a black hole'' and
he returned for clothes and toys, said his mother, Linda Benyahich.
After neighbors saw him she got a call from the board's lawyer, who
said if he came again ``for any reason they were going to send the
sheriff out to remove him.''
   _In Monroe, N.J., a judge mediated an agreement allowing
46-year-old Ann Romer to be a guest for 60 days in the condo she and
her husband Theodore, 60, bought at the Rossmoor Condominiums. The
condo association had not allowed the couple, who live in New York
City, to buy property because Mrs. Romer wasn't 48. The judge's
Sept. 15 agreement allowed them to buy the weekend home.
   The new housing rules allow age restrictions in retirement
communities if all residents are over 62, or if at least 80 percent
of the households have at least one member over 55 and special
services are offered for older people, or in housing sponsored by
state and federal programs for the elderly.
   Under a transition provision, those who are under the minimum age
and were living in an elderly development as of Sept. 13, 1988, will
not have to give up their residence nor will the community
jeapordize its exemption.
   Leon Rubin defends the child-free lifestyle he enjoys at a
Margate condominium that is changing its documents to remain exempt.
His sentiments are widely shared, especially among mostly elderly
developments.
   Rubin, president of the Oriole Gardens Condominium Association,
said many of his neighbors are infirm and under nurses' care, and
besides, ``No one would like to have a squirrely kid next door
crying in the middle of the night.
   ``This is our lifestyle. I'm satisfied with what we have now.''
   While retirement communities are essentially exempted,
adults-only developments around the country will be affected by the
act.
   Attorney Gary Poliakoff of Fort Lauderdale contends the act
encourages discrimination against the 18- to 55-year-olds who live
in adult communities, and probably won't open much existing housing
to children.
   Poliakoff, whose firm represents 1,700 Florida communities, says
most of those affected have smaller units, recreational facilities
designed for adults and a surrounding social infrastructure that's
not oriented to families.
   Mobile home parks also present a special situation.
   ``The people who make up our membership are not elderly in the
usual sense. They're active retirees, social and don't want to live
next door to children,'' said Federation of Mobile Homeowners of
Florida spokeswoman Kathleen Conture.
   Some may have to under the new law. Mobile-home-park owners and
apartment managers now face having to make developments kid-friendly
with playgrounds and safety fences or figure out if they qualify for
exemption as retirement havens.
   In areas with age restrictions, reaction to the act has been
mixed, but some people are clearly upset they may have to give up
adult-only living.
   ``We don't think that you can just take a whole neighborhood and
say we don't want to live with children,'' said Edwards. ``Children
have rights too.''
   Sixteen states have barred housing discrimination on the basis of
familial status, but experts say the laws are generally weak and
contain huge loopholes.
   The California Supreme Court in 1982 prohibited discrimination
against families with children in apartment rentals and later
extended that to condos. Mobile home parks have been exempt, a
provision the federal law will override.
   But families still face subtler discrimination, such as limits on
the number of occupants, complexes with segregated areas for adults
and families with children, and other restrictive rules, said
Morales. About a third of the housing complaints received by
California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing involve
children, he said.
   Enforcement of the 1988 act will rest with the states, if their
housing law is substantially equivalent to federal law and
enforcement mechanisms already in place are recertified by HUD. The
federal housing agency will handle cases in those states that aren't
equipped to deal with housing complaints.
   The period to file a complaint has been extended from 180 days to
a year, and an administrative law judge will now be able to hear a
case and award actual damages, injunctive relief or top civil
penalties of $50,000.
   At the federal court level, a $100,000 cap on punitive damages
has been eliminated. And the federal government, previously only
able to seek injunctive relief, will be able to seek civil penalties
up to $100,000 against violators.
   ``Everybody needs to be educated about what the law says,'' said
Mihaly. ``I think we'll begin to see fairly dramatic changes.''

<TEXT>
   From feudal Tibet to hill tribe
villages in Thailand, an American family has offered medicine, fruit
trees, primer readers _ and the Bible _ to impoverished Asians for
nearly seven decades.
   Members of the Morse missionary clan also rescued downed pilots
in World War II, suffered torture at the hands of Chinese
revolutionaries and hid for six years in a jungle valley from
Burma's military rulers.
   Along the way they picked up a dozen languages and about that
many diseases in a four-generation odyssey across a vast, wild swath
of Asia.
   Today, the Morse family has grown to 75 members and more than
half live in northern Thailand, a tolerant haven for many Western
missionaries forced by political upheavals to uproot from other
corners of Asia.
   While trying to spread Christianity, the Morses carry out basic
development work with groups like the Lisu tribe and attempt to help
the tribes cope with rapid economic and social changes sweeping the
hills. More than 400 hill tribe children _ Christian, Buddhist and
animist _ live in a Morse-run hostel when they come down from their
villages for schooling in this northern hub.
   ``Since we grew up like them in very basic conditions, we can act
as liaisons between where they have been and where they are going,''
says 40-year-old David Morse. ``We hope to be a moderating
influence. We hope that they don't jump from the jungle into the
21st century without being ready.''
   The work, David adds, is in some ways more complex than the
stark, life-or-death situations that faced his grandfather and
family patriarch, Justin Russell Morse, when he and his wife,
Gertrude, left their native Oklahoma for Tibet.
   While today's Morses shop in Chiang Mai supermarkets, family
chronicles say J. Russell had to take along a five-month supply of
candles on the journey to Tibet in 1921. The trip took four months,
with Gertrude clutching an infant son while being carried along
mountain ledges in a sedan chair shouldered by opium-smoking coolies.
   ``Today a lot of missionaries regard what they do as a job they
can quit. They're softies by comparison,'' says Ron, another
grandchild. ``Papa Morses' generation went out for life.''
   J. Russell's sons recalled in interviews that the family put up
with the vermin, desolation and banditry of Tibet but found the
medieval, Buddhist world impenetrable to their message. In 1927,
they left for the tri-border area of Tibet, Burma and China, a
region of dank jungles, remote tribes and towns razed by civil war.
   They also parted with the United Christian Missionary Society and
have since remained a one-family missionary outfit dependent on
support from individual churches in the United States and Canada.
   During World War II, the Morses, in touch with the Allied
command, recommended flight paths through the rugged borderlands,
urged tribespeople to aid downed pilots and themselves rescued
several airmen. J. Russell and two of his sons later were decorated
by the U.S. military.
   J. Russell remained in China through the 1949 victory of Mao
Tse-tung's Communists but was arrested in 1951, jailed and tortured.
Fifteen months later, he was released without explanation and
deported to Hong Kong, arriving with $1.70 in his pocket.
   The family regrouped in Putao, northern Burma, where diseases and
famine were ravaging the Lisu and Rawang, with authorities unable to
offer much assistance.
   The Morses say that besides setting up a clinic, J. Russell and
family members laid out new, sanitation-conscious villages and
planned irrigation canals. A literacy drive was started and son
Robert, now a well-regarded linguist, worked on setting five tribal
languages into written form where none had previously existed.
   A fruit industry, which still thrives today, was initiated, with
J. Russell experimenting with a variety of trees. He trained a corps
of grafters, presenting successful ones with pocket knives that
became local status symbols.
   The Morses and some of their colleagues like to describe those
days as the golden age of missionaries in Asia despite the hardships
and frequent bouts of everything from dengue fever to the plague.
Then, the lack of resources or interest in the hinterlands by
governments turned the Morses into doctors, teachers, builders,
farmers and sometimes even de facto government officials.
   Following a coup in 1962 by strongman Gen. Ne Win, missionaries
were ordered to leave Burma. Instead, the now-extended Morse family
and more than 5,000 tribespeople fled into a no-man's land along the
Burmese-Indian border.
   In a Robinson Crusoe-type existence, they cleared the jungle
floor for fields, built houses with virtually no tools and hunted
monkeys and other game for food. David fabricated an electric
generator from a downed Allied aircraft, lubricating the machine
with bacon rind.
   Burmese troops finally broke into their ``Hidden Valley,'' as a
book about their life described it. Jailed in Mandalay, the younger
Morses, who spoke better Lisu than English, struggled with doorknobs
and had to be taught how to use bathrooms.
   Northern Thailand proved a kind of trail's end for the Morses as
it has for other missionaries expelled from China, Burma, Vietnam
and Laos. Thai authorities take a live-and-let-live attitude, and
the area is populated by half a million ethnic minorities, many
belonging to tribes the missionaries had worked with in other
countries.
   In a quiet, old-style compound of teak houses and towering trees,
the Morses hold informal family councils and David produces hymns
from self-designed computer programs. The Morses include nurses,
preachers, doctors and housewives-turned-accountants; midwestern
American types, Asian spouses and a fourth generation of toddlers
growing up in Asia.
   Gertrude has died but J. Russell, now 91 years old, lives in
retirement in Tulsa, Okla.
   ``Papa Morse wishes he could still be out here. He has his heart
in the work and prays for everybody,'' says Helen, a
daughter-in-law. ``He likes to remember the fruit trees of Putao.''

<HEAD>NASA Heat Sensors Find Buried Spanish Mission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the untrained eye, the computer-generated
aerial map shows only a triangle of red next to a field of blue. But
the image produced by heat-sensing scanners developed by NASA is of
a 17th-century Spanish mission.
   ``It's fantastic,'' said archaeology curator Jerry Milanich of
the Florida Museum of Natural History. ``I never saw anything so
magical in my life.''
   The scanners picked out what is left of the Mission Santa Fe de
Toloco in a cow pasture dotted in spring with tiny purple flowers.
Researchers have found what they believe are the kitchen, priests'
residence, church and cemetery.
   The Daedalus Multispectral Scanner, developed by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Space Remote Sensing Center,
differentiate soil from clay and other early construction materials
by differences in heat absorption.
   Computers create images showing differences as small as a
half-degree.
   The instruments will revolutionize archaeology, Milanich said,
noting they saved $10,000 and five years' work. ``If we started
digging trenches, it would take forever, and we might destroy an
important part of the site,'' he said.
   The pasture _ near the Santa Fe River in Alachua County north of
the University of Florida Gainesville campus _ is where missionaries
tended crops, celebrated Mass and tried to spread the gospel to six
nearby Indian villages.
   It was one of more than 40 mission outposts that dotted ``La
Florida'' beginning in the mid-1500s. Santa Fe de Toloco stood here
more than a century until 1702, when British soldiers and their
Indian allies burned and looted it, leaving ruins that eventually
were hidden by grass and flowers.
   On Christmas Eve 1986, a team led by University of Florida
graduate student Ken Johnson stumbled on pottery, spikes and clay.
Using Spanish documents, they were able to narrow to within 10 miles
the location of Santa Fe de Toloco.

<HEAD>Aerospace Materials Researchers PLaying Hardball</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>

   There's a pitcher at Mississippi State
University with a 200 mph fastball and a batter that can hit
anything the pitcher tosses.
   Not on the baseball diamond. The battery is in the aerospace
engineering department, where scientists have been busily
researching baseball bats for the past year for three manufacturers,
Worth, Easton and Spalding.
   ``Our purpose is to explore how different materials react with
the ball,'' said Professor Keith Koenig, who with Leslie Hester
designed and built most of the machines used to test the bats. They
modified some others, like the 200-mph air cannon. Koenig sets up
most of the experiments and interprets the results, while Hester is
responsible for the hardware. But mostly they play ball.
   ``We shoot the balls out of the air cannon at about 150 miles an
hour and measure the ball speed. We can measure _ with computers _
the ball speed into the bat and away from the bat, the bat movement,
the bat stresses and the direction the ball goes,'' Koenig said.
   They use different materials for bats, such as aluminum,
graphite, ceramic and wood, to test reactions.
   What have they learned?
   ``Well, some information is proprietary _ we don't even share
among companies,'' Koenig said. ``But an example would be the big
difference in how a ball comes off a bat when hit near the handle.''
Some balls travel farther or are harder to field when hit off a bat
handle. However, when a ball strikes the same bat near the head, the
ball doesn't perform nearly so well.
   ``This knowledge would help the batter who crowds the plate,''
Koenig said. ``He would like to know which bat performs well when he
hits off the handle. That's something the bat manufacturers would
like to know, too.''

<HEAD>Test Planned For `Star Wars' Particle Accelerator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists this spring plan to launch a
particle beam accelerator on a 10-minute suborbital flight to help
study whether devices that generate neutral particle beams might be
useful in space-based weapons.
   Electrically charged particle beams would be bent by the Earth's
magnetic field lines, but neutral beams should fly straight,
according to scientists who have been working on such devices for
anti-missile defense since 1975.
   The launch of a 40-foot Aries rocket from White Sands Missile
Range carrying a 10-foot-long particle accelerator will be the first
test in space by the Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists.
   At altitudes above 75 miles, the accelerator will shoot 1,200
pencil-shaped bursts of hydrogen atoms toward the ground. The beams
will cause the air along their paths to glow so they can be tracked
through the night sky. However, the beams won't reach the ground.
Below 75 miles, they collide with thicker air, become electrically
charged and are deflected by the magnetic fields.
   Forty scientists, engineers and technicians have been working on
the experiment, called Beam Experiment Aboard a Rocket, or BEAR. The
team proved accelerators could be made small enough to be boosted by
a rocket, at least for a low-energy experiment. The payload,
including the accelerator, data-gathering devices and means of
controlling the rocket's altitude, is 44 inches in diameter, less
than 24 feet long, and weighs 1{ tons.
   Critics have said the technology is still immature, that a
space-based accelerator would be vulnerable to anti-satellite
weapons and that each one might require a billion watts of
electrical power.

   A new technique that bounces laser
light off brain cells to monitor the amount of oxygen reaching a
fetus could help prevent brain damage and reduce the number of
Caesarean sections, a researcher says.
   The technique has shown good results in tests on 12 patients at
the University of Bonn Gynecological Hospital, said Dr. Stephan
Schmidt, who heads the research team. ``Its main advantage is that
its a gentle monitoring method which can give continuous readings
without touching the fetus.
   ``We still have a long way to go before we make definite
conclusions, but the preliminary results are very promising.''
   The relatively cheap technique _ Schmidt's model costs about
$43,000 _ beams extremely low levels of harmless infrared light into
the fetal brain. The light reflected back provides information about
the supply of oxygen in brain cells; the information is displayed
graphically on a desktop computer.
   ``It is extremely important to us to be able to gauge the level
of oxygen in the tissue cells as often as possible,'' Schmidt said.
Earlier techniques required blood samples from the fetus, which
``has the disadvantage of being a single-point test and has to be
repeated at short intervals.
   ``A continuous record is far more preferable and less
cumbersome.''
   In 20 out of 100 cases, he said, heart monitors indicate the
possibility of oxygen deficiency, but only five of those 20 have
symptoms that would actually require Caesarean delivery, he said.
``With our technique we hope to be able to determine which of those
infants do not really require a caesarean section.''
   Oxygen deficiency is the most common cause of death before,
during and just after birth and is the main contributor to fetal
brain damage, he said.

   Strike-crippled Eastern Airlines shut down nearly all operations
and idled 5,000 workers, saying it could not afford to maintain its
business while pilots honored a 3-day-old Machinists walkout.
   ``We can cannot run an airline with unpredictability,'' Eastern

inconvenience passengers. We cannot afford the steady financial
drain.''
   Matell said Eastern would run only its most profitable routes,

but called off the secondary actions after a New York court ruled
other workers must not honor such picket lines.

   Here is a look at the key issues in the battle between Eastern
Airlines and its striking Machinists union.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WAGES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eastern is seeking $150 million in wage and benefit concessions
to help stem mounting financial losses. Eastern's last offer called
for a top hourly wage of $16 for mechanics and $11.54 for ramp
service workers. Mechanics would get an extra 50 cents an hour in
September 1993 under the proposed 4{-year contract. Eastern
mechanics now earn a top wage of $18.83 an hour and ramp service
workers $15.60 an hour.
   The Machinists want $50 million in raises, an 8 percent hike, but
last week offered to delay increases for 15 months.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BENEFITS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eastern wants to impose a five-year freeze on all pension benefit
increases. Because its union pension funds are underfunded, a freeze
would allow the airline to meet federal funding requirements.
   The Machinists want increases in all benefits.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONFLICT HISTORY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Machinists have fought wage cuts since contract renewal talks
began in October 1987. Eastern pilots and flight attendants a year
earlier reached concessionary agreements that slashed pay by 20
percent.
   The National Mediation Board intervened in the dispute in January
1988, but no progress was made during a year that included massive
layoffs and cost-cutting. The dispute reached loggerheads last month
after Eastern rejected binding arbitration and the mediation board
declared a 30-day cooling-off period before a strike.
   More than 97 percent of the Machinists on Feb. 15 authorized a
strike. President Bush refused to intervene to delay the strike.
Eastern's last contract offer would have cut pay but kept it 13
percent higher than workers who took the 20 percent reductions. The
Machinists rejected it Friday, and the strike began at 12:01 a.m.
Saturday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FINANCIAL PROBLEMS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The airline says it has lost more than $1 billion this decade and
is losing more than $1 million a day. It also has $2.5 billion in
debt. Texas Air Corp. bought Eastern in February 1986 and since then
has undertaken a series of cutbacks in an attempt to restore
profitability. The carrier's workforce since the takeover has shrunk
to about 30,000 from 42,000. Eastern also has sold planes, cut
profitable routes, closed its Kansas City, Mo., hub and taken
smaller savings measures such as eliminating hot food on some
flights.
   Eastern has about $400 million in cash to help it meet its
financial obligations during the strike. In addition, the pending
sale of Eastern's Northeast shuttle to developer Donald Trump will
bring in about $365 million.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LAYING THE BLAME</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Management blames union militancy and unrealistic demands and
says it trimmed back operations elsewhere and needs labor to make
sacrifices. Labor maintains Eastern is suffering because it didn't
react aggressively and competitively to airline deregulation in
1978. In 1983, workers made wage concessions in return for future
profits that never materialized and stock. They don't want further
concessions without proof Eastern is being managed with long-term
commitment to its financial fitness.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SECONDARY EFFECTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The 1926 National Railway Labor Act permits secondary boycotts,
known as sympathy strikes, in air and rail travel. The Machinists on
Sunday decided not to set up pickets that threatened to disrupt
commuting in major cities after a federal judge barred rail workers
from honoring picket lines in the New York area. The Machinists
planned to appeal. The nation's 12 commuter railroads and Amtrak
would be affected by any sympathy strikes.
   The Air Line Pilots Association is asking pilots nationwide to
strictly follow aviation rules starting Tuesday in a job action that
could delay every flight in the country.

   Media firms basked in limelight borrowed from the
$18 billion merger planned by Time Inc. and Warner Communications
Inc. as investors _ apparently expecting further consolidations in
the industry _ bid up stock in media companies.
   The biggest winner in Monday's trading was CBS Inc., whose shares
soared $6 to close at $172.12{ on the New York Stock Exchange. Gulf
and Western Corp., owner of Paramount Pictures Corp., rose $2.50 to
close at $45.87{, while Walt Disney Co. rose $1.12{ to $77.62{ a
share.
   Securities analysts said they expected more consolidations in the
media business, although not as big as the deal announced Saturday
to create Time Warner Inc., the largest media concern in the world.
   ``It's a unique opportunity and I can't see that you're able to
replicate it,'' said John Reidy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Time and Warner said the new company would have projected annual
revenues of $10 billion _ surpassing the current world
communications leader, West Germany's Bertelsmann AG, which reported
$6 billion in 1987 revenue.
   That is exactly what Time Chairman J. Richard Munro had in mind
as he and Warner Chairman Steven Ross discussed a merger over the
past two years.
   ``We believe that by the mid-1990s the media and entertainment
industry will be composed of a limited number of global giants,''
Munro told securities analysts last November. ``Time intends to be
one of these companies.''
   Who are the others? Mainly foreign publishing and broadcasting
giants such Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Maxwell Communication
Corp., and electronics behemoth Sony Corp., that have scooped up
U.S. media concerns in a torrent of deals made possible over the
past several years by their own riches and the weak U.S. dollar.
   In his speech to analysts, Munro said the spurt of acquisitions,
mergers and join ventures among media companies in recent years has
given these businesses ``the sheer size required to compete
efficiently on a global basis.''
   For example, Ross said in an interview, his company's deal with
Time would give Warner better access to foreign markets for its
video business. He predicted the greatest impact of the deal would
come in Time and Warner overseas operations.
   Analysts said they expected foreigners to continue buying U.S.
companies.
   Reidy, of Drexel Burnham Lambert, noted that Sony _ which bought
CBS Records last year _ has expressed interest in owning a motion
picture company, including Columbia Pictures.
   Bertelsmann is not as well known in this country as some other
big media names, such as Murdoch or Robert Maxwell, but it owns the
publisher Doubleday &amp; Co. and RCA records. Reidy suggested
Bertelsmann might also move into the film business.
   News Corp. owns newspaper, magazine and book publishing
operations in Australia, Britain and the United States. His American
holdings include Triangle Publications Inc., the publisher of TV
Guide; Harper &amp; Row Publishers Inc.; 20th Century Fox Film Corp.;
and Fox Broadcasting Network.
   Murdoch has no plans to slow down although News Corp., which had
$4.3 billion in 1988 revenue, has become burdened by debt because of
its many acquisitions. Murdoch also plans to raise $1 billion or
more for buying other communications companies around the world.
   London-based Maxwell Communication Corp. had $2.6 billion in
revenue in 1987. Robert Maxwell _ motivated partly by a rivalry with
Murdoch _ wants to see that figure swell to $5 billion to $9
billion, and he has said he intends to keep acquiring businesses
until he reaches that goal.
   Last year he won a long battle for Macmillan Inc. and also agreed
to buy Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp.'s Official Airline Guides.
   American companies expect to join the consolidation.
   Francine Blum, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., said Gulf
&amp; Western and Walt Disney are candidates for consolidations among
U.S. firms.
   She also said she expected to see alliances between movie studios
and the major television networks.

<HEAD>Philippine Economy Showing Signs Of Revival After Years Of Decline</HEAD>

   After years of decline, the Philippine
economy shows signs of revival, and business leaders hope that the
modest boom heralds desperately needed stability for President
Corazon Aquino's government.
   Serious problems still face the Aquino administration, including
a burgeoning population, environmental destruction and the fact that
millions of Filipinos have not yet benefited economically from the
turnaround.
   The Philippines, which had been East Asia's second-most-developed
nation after Japan, now lags far behind other non-Communist
Southeast Asian economies after 20 years of misrule under ousted
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Government figures show that more than 60 percent of the 58
million Filipinos live below the poverty line. Millions still leave
each year in search of employment abroad.
   Nonetheless, the economy has grown during each year since Mrs.
Aquino took power in the February 1986 uprising against Marcos. Her
rise to power followed two straight years of negative growth and
soaring inflation.
   Throughout the capital, construction projects have resumed, and
department stores are jammed with shoppers on weekends and holidays.
   Mrs. Aquino abolished the ruinous state monopolies on sugar and
coconut export, which Marcos and his associates used to corner those
markets, and moved slowly to remove government from private business.
   Last year, the gross national product grew by 6.7 percent, while
inflation remained under 9 percent. According to government figures,
unemployment fell from 11.2 percent in 1987 to 9.6 percent, due
mostly to a boom in construction that absorbed out-of-work farmers.
   Agriculture, which provides the livelihood of about 65 percent of
Filipinos, grew 3.4 percent despite several destructive typhoons.
   Economists say most of the economic growth is due to consumer
spending _ up 5.1 percent in 1988 _ thanks in large measure to a
relaxation of import restrictions and a drop in world petroleum
prices.
   But the favorable figures have led to renewed optimism within the
foreign and Filipino business community that the country may at last
be on the road to recovery.
   ``In sharp contrast to the wait-and-see attitude so prevalent
just two years ago, businessmen, entrepreneurs and consumers took
positive and decisive steps to keep the Philippine economic recovery
on the right track,'' said the influential Makati Business Club in a
report.
   In 1988, the Board of Investments approved $1.47 billion worth of
investment projects, up 216 percent over the previous year. About 22
percent of the total came from foreign investors.
   Last Friday, Toyota and Mitsui inaugurated a new auto
manufacturing plant in suburban Paranaque that will be half-owned by
Filipinos.
   Trade Secretary Jose Concepcion said total exports last year
reached $7.07 billion. South Korea and Hong Kong broke through that
barrier 12 years ago, but nevertheless the figure represented a 24
percent increase in Philippine exports over the previous year.
   The boom has not been limited to Manila, which traditionally
outpaces the rest of the island nation. Last year, the economy in
Cebu City and surrounding islands grew by 7.5 percent.
   In Davao City, exports of wood and processed foods topped $450
million last year. Construction in the southern city tripled from
1987 levels and banks reported a 35 percent increase in business
loans.
   Western diplomats and Filipino commentators believe political
stability has been the key to the economic rebound. After a series
of failed coups in 1986 and 1987, including the abortive putsch on
Aug. 28, 1987, that killed 53 people, there were no serious, armed
attempts against Mrs. Aquino last year.
   Rumors of new, right-wing conspiracies periodically sweep Manila.
But there has been a growing sense here that Mrs. Aquino will finish
her term in 1992.
   A dramatic upsurge in street killings by Communist rebels in the
capital tapered off last year because of a police crackdown and a
public backlash to the carnage.
   In addition, the wave of strikes which swept Manila, Cebu and
other industrial areas in the months after Marcos' downfall declined
sharply. In October 1987, Mrs. Aquino ordered a crackdown on illegal
strikes. Barricades that blocked pedestrian and vehicle traffic were
torn down and strike leaders were frequently arrested.
   According to the Labor Department, those measures reduced the
number of strikes from 484 in 1987 to 296 last year. Government
figures show production time lost because of strikes fell by 20
percent in 1988 over the previous year.

<HEAD>Students Like Controversial New TV Program, Commercials And All</HEAD>

   The controversy over beaming a
commercially sponsored television news show for teen-agers into
classrooms doesn't seem to bother the students and teachers who
watched Channel One's debut at Central High School.
   The students said they liked the idea of seeing the news,
something a few of them conceded they don't watch enough of at home,
and enjoyed the features, such as a look at the life of Soviet teens.
   Teacher Mary Simpson's only complaint was that the show was ``a
litte fast,'' although the pace didn't seem to bother her students.
   She said those complaining about the commercials are mistaken.
``We can't get something for nothing,'' she said.
   The first show in a test run of the project included paid pitches
for Levi's 501 jeans, Snickers candy bars and Head &amp; Shoulders
shampoo. The program premiered in five high schools Monday.
   Whittle Communications LP, the Knoxville-based media concern that
produced the program, plans to sell up to two miutes of commercial
time on each 12-minute show to pay for the hardware it is giving
schools to show it.
   Ad time already has been sold on the remaining 24 shows in the
test for products such as breath mints, acne medications, snack
chips, and cosmetics.
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. has bought time in four product categories
to see if the program is ``a viable vehicle'' for reaching
teen-agers, while helping helping schools provide a topical
educational program, said Sydney McHugh, a company spokeswoman.
   The presence of paid advertising on the show has enraged some
education groups, who say Big Business should be barred from making
sales pitches to students in the classroom.
   But Central High students said the ads did not bother them.
   ``It's fine with me,'' said Shelley Bible, a 14-year-old
freshman. ``You get more pressure from other students than you do
from the commercials.''
   Toi McCane, a 17-year-old senior, said the commercials ``are just
the same thing you get on the news at night.''
   The show also debuted Monday at Mumford High School in Detroit,
Gahr High School in Cerritos, Calif., Eisenhower Middle School in
Kansas City, Kan., and Billerica Memorial High School near Boston.
   The sixth test site, Withrow High School in Cincinnati, was
closed by bad weather Monday, but was expected to join the test
today.
   Whittle Communications has years of experience in producing
ad-filled magazines and posters aimed at the student market. But
this is the company's first venture into television.
   Groups such as the National Parent-Teacher Association and the
National Association of Secondary School Principals have opposed it.
   ``They are trying to make it a part of every school day, and this
medium has a much stronger impact than any other,'' said Tari
Marshal, a spokeswoman for the National PTA.
   But Whittle chairman Christopher Whittle said that schools could
simply not afford the equipment and the level of programming that he
is providing.
   The six test schools each were given about $50,000 in television
monitors, video recording equipment and a satellite dish to receive
the daily news show. They will keep the gear no matter how the test
goes.
   If the test proves successful, Whittle hopes to expand it
nationally to as many as 8,000 schools in the fall of 1990.
   In exchange for the equipment, which may be used for other
purposes, the schools agree to run the news show each school day.
   The first show started off with some flashy graphics, and then
two youthful anchors read news headlines.
   The news coverage included segments on Sen. John Tower's troubled
nomination as defense secretary, the Eastern Airlines strike and
threats against author Salman Rushdie, as well as a piece on the
controversy over the new show. An anti-drug ad was run as a public
service.
   In Connie Wilkes's senior home room class at Central High, all 20
students appeared to watch the show closely, figeting only for a
commercial.
   At the Eisenhower Middle School, more than 700 students watched
the inaugural program, Principal Stan Jasinskas said.
   ``So far, most of the reaction seems to be positive,'' he said.
   Jasinskas said the program may help improve students' knowledge
of world events.
   As far as the commercials, he said he thought the school would be
able to help the students be more analytical in their approach to
them.
   Whittle gave the first show high marks for ontent, but said some
work remains to be done on the pacing of the broadcast. He also said
his anchors ought to ``loosen up a bit.''

   Department officials cautioned that these figures may not be

reporting. For example, some airlines count in their complaint data
courtesy tracers, in which they seek to help people from other
airlines find lost baggage. In addition, reporting methods vary for

   Share prices bounced back on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today after a plunge in early trading, while the dollar
rose sharply against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which shed 9.63 points
Monday, rose 61.08 points, or 0.19 percent, today to close at
31,937.94. After a drop in early trading, the Nikkei started upward
at midmorning.
   The index's early decline followed news that Hisashi Shinto,
former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's largest
company, and his former secretary were arrested Monday on bribery
charges in connection with a major stock scandal involving top
politicians, dealers said.
   ``But the Nikkei started to recover from its setback following
Finance Minister (Tatsuo) Murayama's comment that the yen's weak
performance had nothing to do with the stock scandal,'' said Kenji
Ishizuka, a trader at Daiwa Securities.
   Murayama told reporters today that the yen's decline ``did not
have anything to do (with Shinto's arrest) .... It's a market after
all, and who knows why it moves.''
   Ishizuka said investors' interest in steel and construction
issues contributed to the index's rise. Volume traded on the first
section was estimated at 1 billion shares.
   In currency dealings, the dollar finished at 129.03 yen, up 1.40
yen from Monday's 127.63-yen close. The currency started opened at
129.25 yen and ranged between 128.87 yen and 129.28 yen.
   After gaining 2.12 yen over four days last week, the dollar had
declined by 0.49 yen on Monday.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's higher opening in Tokyo today to
its gains on overseas markets overnight. But the rate did not move
much once trading started in Tokyo, said Minori Takeuchi of Chemical
Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Hardly anybody was participating in the afternoon session after
failing to lead the market anywhere, because buying and selling were
equally mixed,'' she said.
   Only speculative investors were trading, adjusting their dollar
positions, Ms. Takeuchi added.

   The dollar rose against all major currencies except
the British pound and Japanese yen in cautious European trading
today. Gold prices also were higher in Europe.
   Dealers said the dollar, which slipped back in profit-taking from
early highs, had been buoyed by a drop in West German money market
rates and by a Japanese official's remark that the dollar had
bottomed out.
   The dollar has been gaining against the West German mark since
the West German central bank, the Bundesbank, decided last week
against raising interest rates, dealers in Frankfurt said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.40 Japanese yen to a closing 129.03 yen. Later, in
London, it edged down to 128.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8575 West German marks, up from 1.8531; 1.5865
Swiss francs, up from 1.5830; 6.3080 French francs, up from 6.2955;
2.0965 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0855; 1,363.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,359.25; 1.1955 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1928.
   In London, the British pound opened lower against the dollar,
then rose to $1.7215 from $1.7210 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $386.90 a troy ounce, up
from the $386.25 bid late Monday. At mid-morning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $386.30.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $386.40, up from the $386.30
bid late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.26 to close at a bid of
$388.21.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid price of $5.80 a troy
ounce, down from $5.81 late Monday.

<HEAD>Some Repossessed Real Estate May be Used for Social Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is considering ways to
ease concerns in Congress that its savings and loan plan would
permit regulators to dump billions of dollars of repossessed real
estate onto fragile Texas markets, according to an industry official.
   Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent
Bankers Association of America, said Monday that ``an element of the
administration'' is examining proposals to combine federal and state
money to pay for a real estate maintenance program.
   As part of the program, some of the real estate could be used for
day care centers, food programs or in some other way that meets
President Bush's ``kinder, gentler'' social objectives, he said.
   ``Thought is being given to it, very, very high level thought,''
Guenther said.
   In other S&amp;L developments, Monday:
   _Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, introduced the administration's S&amp;L proposal in the
House. It was referred to Gonzalez' committee, defusing a
jurisdictional dispute between the banking panel and the House Ways
and Means Committee that could have delayed congressional action.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of Ways and Means, had
sought joint jurisdiction, arguing that a key element of the S&amp;L
plan provided for selling $50 billion in government bonds and that
his panel's turf covered revenue raising.
   _Six Washington-based think tanks _ ranging from the conservative
Heritage Foundation to the liberal Brookings Institution _ issued a
statement saying the Bush proposal doesn't provide enough money or
reform.
   Gonzalez and other legislators from Texas are worried that if
regulators try to sell off repossessed real estate too fast, it
could collapse the already weak real estate market in the state.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the commercial bank
regulator which under Bush's restructuring plan also would take the
lead in resolving S&amp;L problems, has historically sold repossessed
property faster than S&amp;L regulators.
   Guenther described the possible addition of a property management
program to the administration plan as a contingency rather than a
Bush initiative.
   ``If the Congress moves in this direction, they have to be
prepared,'' he said.
   An administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the administration wants to preserve regulators' discretion to
judge the best time to sell.
   ``I don't think anyone anticipates that real estate would be
dumped,'' the official said. ``But we would prefer the flexibility
to sell as market conditions dictate and permit. That's the best way
to protect the taxpayers' interest as well as that of local
markets.''
   Two Texas Republicans _ Sen. Phil Gramm and Rep. Steve Bartlett,
both members of the banking committees _ said in telephone
interviews they agreed it would be unwise to dictate when or how
regulators can sell property. Both expressed confidence that FDIC
Chairman L. William Seidman would not sell at below-market prices.
   In a speech last week, Seidman said, ``If we can't obtain today's
fair price, we'll hold on.'' But he warned that withholding sale of
property for too long would create an ``overhang'' on the real
estate market and hurt local economies.
   The six groups offering a critique of the Bush plan were the
National Taxpayers Union Foundation, the Cato Institute, American
Enterprise Institute, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the
Heritage Foundation and the Brookings Institution.
   They said Bush's plan to raise $50 billion for S&amp;Ls over three
years does not provide money fast enough. They said the government
should spend $50 billion by the end of the 1989 fiscal year on Sept.
30 and then decide how much more it needs.
   The groups urged Congress to fight industry attempts to weaken
the stricter capital standards of the Bush plan and advised it to
add the following reforms: market-based accounting, risk-based
deposit insurance premiums and limits on deposit insurance. It said
Congress should not attempt to turn back the clock by restricting
S&amp;Ls mostly to home mortgage lending.

<HEAD>FAA Says Security Up, But Fines Still Top $1 Million In Weapons Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aviation security has improved, but federal
agents still managed to slip 156 weapons through airport security
resulting in $1.18 million in fines against domestic airlines, the
Federal Aviation Administration announced.
   The agency said the detection rate for all airlines checked was
93.1 percent, compared to 88.2 percent in July 1988 and 78.9 percent
in the first such tests of the system in 1987.
   In a separate Transportation Department report Monday, airlines
showed improvements in the number of flight delays, baggage problems
and passengers with reservations who were ``bumped'' off flights.
   Fines against airlines in the weapons tests resulted when airport
security failed to detect fake guns, knives, explosives or other
weapons in hand-carried luggage or in the clothing of federal agents.
   The largest fines were $186,000 against American Airlines for 24
alleged violations, $151,000 against Continental Airlines for 20,
$136,000 against Eastern for 18 and $132,000 against USAir for 15.
Other fines ranged from $1,000 for single violations to $92,000.
   FAA fines for security lapses have totalled nearly $4 million
since the program began two years ago, the FAA said. About 50
airlines have been cited for 557 detection failures.
   The agency said it ran more than 6,800 checks of airline security
systems during 1988. It said the latest fines resulted from
incidents over the past year.
   Under FAA rules, airlines are responsible for screening
passengers and their carry-on luggage. At airports where security is
contracted by several airlines, each carrier is held responsible for
any failure.
   In a monthly report by the Transportation Department, the 13
largest U.S. carriers reported that 76.7 percent of their flights
operated on time in January, compared with 76.1 percent in December
1988 and 69.2 percent in January 1988. Delays caused by mechanical
problems are not counted in the monthly air consumer survey.
   Mishandled baggage reports filed against the airlines in January
declined from an average of 8.58 per 1,000 passengers in December to
7.86 in January.
   The airlines also reported that in 1988 the number of passengers
denied seats for which they had reservations was 2.97 per 100,000.
In 1987, airlines reported 3.99 passengers per 100,000 were
``bumped.''
   Consumer complaints were up slightly in February, however, to
1,138, compared to 1,086 in January, the department said, adding
that this is a 51 percent decline from February 1988 when complaints
reached 2,308.

   Although organized labor says it did not pick
the fight, the nation's unions are looking to how the government
handles the Eastern Airlines strike as the Gettysburg for workers'
rights in the 1990s.
   Not since former President Reagan fired 11,000 federal air
traffic controllers in an illegal strike in 1981 have the stakes in
a strike been greater.
   Reagan's action emboldened employers in the recession years of
1981 and 1982 to demand wage concessions from workers and get them.
Automatic inflation-indexed, cost-of-living adjustments that were a
fixture of labor contracts in previous decades disappeared from many
settlements in the '80s.
   Steel, auto and rubber workers counting on $15 to $21 hourly
wages took wage cuts, as did meatpackers and airline workers paid
half as much.
   Those who balked _ copper miners in Arizona, meatpackers in
Minnesota or pilots and machinists at Continental Airlines after
Frank Lorenzo acquired it _ found themselves on the street, replaced
by non-union workers often willing to work for half as much.
   The return of national economic prosperity after the recession
did not reverse the trend.
   But through it all, two groups of union workers were able to
preserve and in some cases even increase their wages relative to
inflation: teachers and other state, county and municipal employees,
and railroad workers.
   The first group did it through a recognition that U.S.
educational standards were falling, by using public sector
collective bargaining laws enacted under President John F. Kennedy,
and by demonstrating an ability to cut off vital public services.
   Rail workers persevered largely through the 1926 National Railway
Labor Act, a law governing labor relations in both railroads and
airlines and passed largely in an effort to stem union power through
government intervention and maintain transportation vital to
interstate commerce.
   Now, however, the labor movement is looking to the railway labor
law it once vigorously opposed to lead it out of a decade in which
it lost more than a fourth of its members. Recent uses of the law
have raised those union hopes.
   The president and Congress have broad powers under the railway
labor law to impose contract settlements on management and unions
through Presidential Emergency Boards. They lack those powers in
other sectors of the economy.
   Reagan used the mechanism several times, blocking threatened
railroad strikes and effectively stifling management bids for
concessions.
   And although the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act forbids striking union
members at one company from picketing another company, the Supreme
Court in 1987 upheld the legality of such secondary boycotts at
railroads and airlines.
   Unions are counting on that combination to defeat Eastern
Airlines and Lorenzo, its principal owner, whom AFL-CIO President
Lane Kirkland on Monday called the ``Typhoid Mary of union busters
in the transportation industry.''
   It was Lorenzo who acquired Continental Airlines in 1981 and then
declared bankruptcy two years later _ a move that allowed him to
cancel all of the company's union contracts. Eventually all of the
union workers were replaced.
   The Supreme Court later upheld Lorenzo's right to abrogate
Continental's labor contracts under the bankruptcy statutes,
creating a fear among labor leaders that the example could be
followed by any company.
   The AFL-CIO spearheaded legislation passed by Congress in 1985
changing the law, but ever since then Lorenzo has been at the top of
the labor organization's enemies list.
   Bringing an end to the favored tax treatment given debt-financed
leveraged buyouts exemplified by Lorenzo's acquisition of Eastern in
1986 has this year replaced trade at the top of labor's legislative
agenda.
   Kirkland acknowledged the ``broad implications'' if Eastern
succeeds in cutting the pay of its aircraft mechanics by $4,000 a
year and its ramp workers by $8,000 annually as demanded in the
company's last offer before the strike Saturday.
   ``There are no doubt those who are cheering him on in management
and certain circles in corporate America who want to see his tactics
succeed,'' he said Monday. ``This company is not in trouble because
of the wages it pays _ labor costs at Eastern are lower than other
airlines operating profitably and efficiently.''
   ``This company is in trouble because it's in hock to the banks
some $2.5 billion,'' Kirkland said. ``The interest cost on that debt
... in excess of $800,000 a day ... is virtually equal to the amount
this company is losing.
   ``This is not an atypical situation in American industry with the
vast infection of leveraged buyouts and enormous debt loads that
have been saddled on otherwise good companies.''

   For a fish, getting to spend time in one
of Keith Jones' aquariums must be about as good as can be.
   There, in complete safety, a fish gets first-class accommodations
for several weeks, his only chore being to perform taste tests for a
fellow who appreciates fish.
   ``It's like taking them to Baskin-Robbins,'' said Jones. ``We ask
them to tell us which samples they don't like, which ones they like
and which ones they really like. There's no stress, we keep them
well fed and the water clean. They don't live a bad life.''
   There's a sinister motive, though, from a fish's point of view.
Jones is a fish biologist for Berkley Inc. of Spirit Lake, which
makes fishing lures. His job is to isolate the chemicals that fish
identify as food, and then make them into lures.
   ``I'm somewhat of a unique species,'' he said. ``I don't know of
a single other fishing lure company that has a fish biologist on
staff.''
   He also has discovered that fish do not necessarily like a
repugnant bait.
   ``There's a mistaken impression that the stinkier the bait, the
better. That's a gross error. That's not how it works. The chemicals
that catfish rely on as a signal for food has nothing to do with how
stinky it is,'' he said.
   Some stinky baits, like old cheese, do contain elements that are
quite appetizing for catfish, ``but it doesn't contain very much of
them, and the part that does is probably not the stinky part.''
   The fish tests are simple.
   ``You take little cotton pellets, the same as you would find in a
dentist's office. By themselves, they're neutral. Fish neither like
them nor dislike them.
   ``If you put one in water, a rainbow trout might attack it. Once
inside the mouth, the next thing that happens depends on what the
fish perceives it to be. If he's neutral towards it or doesn't like
it, he spits it out in a split second. If he likes it, he might mull
it over, chew it up and then spit it out. The ones they really like,
they'll go ahead and swallow.
   ``The cotton doesn't hurt the fish. It's just like a high fiber
diet.''
   He said he has isolated some tasty chemicals for several species.
The substances are marketed either in a liquid that is dropped on
the lure or as a putty-like glob that becomes the lure itself.
   There is still years of work, however, to identify all of the
chemicals that fish interpret to be food, but theoretically, the
perfect lure would put the beginning fisherman on the same plateau
with the pro.
   ``We haven't quite reached that level yet,'' Jones said. ``We
have a standard joke around here, if you want to improve the fish's
odds, try fishing with one arm tied behind your back, or use a
barbless hook.''

   The Supreme Court's refusal to intervene in an
acid rain dispute between the Northeast and the industrial Midwest
leaves the problem of interstate air pollution up to President Bush
and Congress.
   For nearly a decade, a group of northeastern states has waged a
legal campaign to try to get the Environmental Protection Agency to
crack down on industrial polluters as far away as Illinois, claiming
pollution from those states is ruining their lakes and forests.
   On Monday, the Supreme Court decided against considering the
case. It let stand a federal appeals court decision agreeing with
the EPA that the states had not shown that their pollution problems
stemmed from emissions hundreds of miles away.
   But some environmentalists and EPA officials suggested Monday
that the legal fight may no longer have the importance it once had,
anyway. Congress is expected this year to enact new federal
legislation specifically addressing acid rain pollution.
Environmentalists hope the legislation will curb emissions of sulfur
dioxides and nitrogen oxide from coal-burning power plants and
factories.
   These pollutants often travel hundreds of miles and fall to the
ground as highly acidic rain destroying freshwater life and forest
vegetation in areas where the air otherwise is considered largely
free of pollution. The New England states have been among those
complaining about acid rain caused by the industrial Midwest.
   In the early 1980s, petitions to the EPA by Maine, New York and
Pennsylvania claimed that soot, smoke and sulfur dioxide were
blowing from the industrial Midwest and making it impossible for
them to meet federally required air pollution requirements.
   They cited pollutants from coal-burning utility plants and
factories in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee
and West Virginia.
   But the EPA argued that the complaining states were responsible
for maintaining their own air quality and that they had not produced
sufficient evidence that the pollution stemmed from smokestakes in
the states cited. The EPA also argued that federal law is not
specifically designed to cover such long-range pollution.
   Last July a federal appeals court agreed and, deferring to the
agency's expertise, said the EPA's position was reasonable.
   Although New York did not pursue the matter to the Supreme Court,
Maine and Pennsylvania were joined in the petition before the high
court by Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Connecticut.
   The case has never specifically cited acid rain because there is
no federal acid rain legislation. Instead it has focused on the
amount of certain pollutants that were found in the air.
   According to a national acid rain assessment program, the
industrial belt stretching from West Virginia to Illinois accounts
for high emissions of sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxide.
   Federal clean air legislation enacted in 1970 directed that
industrial and utility smokestakes be heightened, a requirement
which improved air quality near such plants, but sent the emissions
higher into the air where they traveled farther.
   Scientists believe that about two-thirds of the sulfur dioxide
emissions in the United States come from coal-burning electric power
plants and another 11 percent from industrial fuel combustion.
Nearly half of all nitrogen oxides are believe to come from electric
power plant and industrial fuel combustion, while nearly 38 percent
comes from transportation.

<HEAD>Nature, Policy Both Helped Cut Grain Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No doubt that last year's yield-shriveling
drought in North America had much to do with the sharp decline in
world grain supplies, but an Agriculture Department economist says
that U.S. domestic farm policy also played an important role.
   Frederic Surls of the department's Economic Research Service said
last summer's drought ``abruptly changed the world grain situation''
after a decade of surplus and low prices to a period of tight
supplies and rising prices.
   ``Part of the drop in world stocks over the last two years was
intentional,'' he said. ``Production consistently exceeded
consumption through most of the 1980s. Two years ago, world and U.S.
stocks reached a record, both in total and in relation to use. A
major concern at that time was to balance supply and use by
stimulating consumption and discouraging production.''
   As part of the answer, the United States took large amounts of
cropland from production. Wheat farmers, for example, had to idle
27.5 percent of their base acreage for both the 1987 and 1988 crops
in order to qualify for government supports.
   Larger reductions also applied to corn and other ``coarse''
grains. The Conservation Reserve Program, aimed at idling up to 45
million acres of fragile cropland by the end of 1990, also took huge
bites.
   Mainly as a result of these government actions and lower prices,
there was a 14 percent drop in the acreage planted to wheat and
coarse grains between 1986 and 1988, Surls said in the March issue
of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   ``At the same time, low world prices discouraged production in
other exporting countries, particularly Argentina, Australia and
Canada,'' he said. ``So competitor production also leveled off, and
foreign stocks, which were near a record at the end of 1986-87,
began to drop during 1987-88.''
   Surls said that at this point there was ``an additional and
dramatic role'' by the weather.
   ``In 1987, a poor monsoon in Asia sharply lowered world rice
stocks,'' he said. ``Record drought in North America in 1988 was
responsible for a sharp drawdown of wheat and coarse grain stocks.''
   But Surls added: ``There were no serious crop setbacks in most of
the rest of the world; foreign grain consumption increased despite
tighter exporter supplies.''
   World grain stocks at the end of the 1988-89 season are expected
to be down 30 percent from a year ago to 279 million metric tons,
the lowest in more than a decade. Most of the decline is in the
United States, which held an average of 34 percent of the world's
total between 1977 and 1987.
   Just two years ago, the United States' grain inventory was a
record 204 million tons, or 45 percent of the world's total. By the
end of this year, the U.S. will hold only 74 million tons, or 27
percent of the total. Foreign stocks are down, too, but their
decline has been much smaller.
   Surls said the current situation in some ways is similar to
1972-73. But that was when the Soviet Union came into the U.S.
market in a big way, and the drop in stockpiles was due to exports,
not production shortfalls.
   ``The dramatic growth of consumption and depletion of world
stocks (in the early 1970s) created widespread pessimism about the
world's ability to feed itself,'' he said. ``Projections of
long-term chronic shortages and higher prices became common.''
   But grain production surged back, inventories grew again, and
real prices ``resumed their long-term decline,'' Surls said.
Attention then returned to the excess capacity of U.S. and world
agriculture.
   Surls said it is too early to say a great deal about world crop
prospects for 1989-90, but he offered some points to consider:
   _The best estimate of world grain yields in 1989-90 is for them
to be near the historical trend or close to it, although ``based on
weather to date, North American winter wheat yield potential may be
reduced.''
   _Substantial excess production capacity will be brought back into
use this year. In the United States, acreage reduction requirements
for both wheat and coarse grains have been lowered to 10 percent,
and plantings will be up. Overseas, acreage probably will rise in
response to higher world market prices.
   _Production is likely to rise substantially. While the increase
may stop the drawing down of world grain inventories, the actual
rebuilding of stockpiles probably will be small because consumption
will be close to production.
   _The rebuilding of world grain stocks probably will stretch over
several years. Even with yields back on track, the world's grain
supply-demand situation will keep prices up relative to those of the
mid-1980s.
   _If the world experiences short crops this year, particularly for
wheat, there will be only limited reserves. A significant shortfall
would mean sharply higher prices and reduced world consumption.
   ``Finally, the longer-run concerns of some observers about
slowing growth in food production are not likely to be important for
1989-90,'' he said. ``As recently as two years ago, the world
situation was one of excess capacity. The underlying longrun
tendency is still for production to exceed consumption unless real
prices fall.''

<HEAD>Signup Period Set for Conservation Reserve Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers will have another opportunity this
summer to put highly erodible land in the government's Conservation
Reserve Program, says Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   Yeutter said Monday the ninth CRP signup period will be July 17
through Aug. 4 and that farmers who want to offer land under the
program should contact local offices of the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Under the program, farmers agree to take land from production for
10 years. In return, based on bids they submit, farmers who are
accepted receive annual rental payments from the government and
one-time assistance to pay half the cost of planting trees, shrubs
and grass to guard against erosion.
   The eighth round of applications was completed on Feb. 24, but
Yeutter said the final results will not be ready until June.
Meanwhile, he said, the ``maximum acceptable rental rates'' for land
offered by farmers will be the same as in the seventh signup.
   Those are the maximum payments under the CRP for land put into
the program. The rates vary by state and often within single states
themselves, from a maximum of $30 per acre annually for
less-productive land to as much as $115 per acre each year for
better land.
   A total of 28.2 million acres was accepted into CRP through the
first seven signups, with the annual payment averaging around $49
per acre.
   The goal of the CRP as set by Congress in the 1985 farm law is to
have 40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland
taken from production by the end of 1990.

   One former aerospace worker says she got lost
driving on a road she used every day. Another can't always remember
her children's ages. And a third likens her mood swings to a
``roller coaster, up and down.''
   The aerospace employees all told a Senate panel Monday they
suffered chronic physical and mental illness from exposure to
hazardous chemicals.
   An official for Boeing Co., which employed two of the workers,
said the company was concerned for the safety of employees exposed
to hazardous chemicals, but the chairman of the Senate Environment
subcommittee on toxic substances, Harry Reid, rebuked the aerospace
company.
   The Nevada Democrat said he felt Boeing was ``minimizing'' the
effects that hazardous materials can have on workers by pleading
ignorance to the danger and emphasizing disagreements in the medical
community.
   Boeing's vice president for human resources, Joseph Peritore,
told the subcommittee there was no evidence to link an acidic resin
formerly used by the company with workers' health problems.
   Peritore said the company nonetheless, out of concern for
workers' health, discontinued use of the material even though it was
``determined that the material presented no significant health
hazard.''
   Peritore said Boeing ``not only met, but significantly exceeded''
regulatory standards, and testified that the medical community was
divided.
   ``The fact that we believed the material was safe became
irrelevant,'' said Peritore. ``In the highly charged atmosphere that
existed, we felt the only way to alleviate our employees' concerns
was to remove the material from the shop altogether. And we did.''
   One witness, Deborah Forbes-Sutherland, 39, of Westlake Village,
Calif., said she began working 16 years ago for J.S. Switzer, a
company that distributes aerospace chemicals.
   Telling the panel she almost died a year ago, Ms.
Forbes-Sutherland said that when asked by customers if the chemicals
were safe, she unwittingly told them, ``Yes, if you don't eat them
on your breakfast cereal. I lied to those people.''
   Former Boeing employee Bonnie Faye Schrum, of Renton, Wash., said
chemical exposure caused her co-workers to pass out, vomit, act as
if they were drunk at work and feel like ``their head was going to
explode.''
   ``We were discouraged from reporting this'' to the company
medical department, she testified, and said workers were threatened
with dismissal after complaining. ``You either worked with these
chemicals or you did not have a job,'' she said.
   ``I'm not the same person I was five years ago,'' she testified.
``I can't pump gas. I can't go to the grocery store without getting
sick. I can't sleep at night, I can't eat, I have no energy. I don't
know my kids, I don't know their ages.''
   Beverly McCormick, of North Bend, Wash., said she became
disoriented from exposure to chemicals at Boeing, and once got lost
while ``driving down a highway I drove every day.''
   Lori Liberty, of Encino, Calif., who appeared at the hearing
wearing gloves, said she was ``poisoned'' by chemicals while working
at Lockheed in Burbank, Calif., and has been unable to work for two
years.
   Ms. Liberty, 33, said she has suffered from severe headaches,
impaired speech, bleeding fingers, nails that fall off, and moods
that were ``like a roller coaster, up and down.''
   Afraid to have children because she's worried about birth
defects, Ms. Liberty told senators she takes 14 to 20 tablets daily
for her various ailments, including medicine for depression, and
sees specialists ranging from psychiatrists to a toxicologist.
   ``I don't think I can ever go back to the job I enjoyed,'' she
said, blaming the company for improper ventilation, failure to warn
workers of dangers, a lack of protective devices, and using her as a
``guinea pig'' to try out new chemicals while tubes were attached to
her to measure exposure.
   She contended the company threatened to fire her when she
complained.
   Dale H. Daniels, executive vice president for Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems Co., said the company ``recognizes that raw
materials and processes in the workplace pose potential health
threats.''
   However, he added, ``When employees are properly trained and
utilize the proper protective equipment, together with adequate
engineering controls, the employees can work safely.''

<HEAD>Rockwell Fined $5.5 Million for Defense Procurement Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp. has been fined
$5.5 million for double-billing the Pentagon, and the punishment
will serve as a warning to other defense contractors, U.S. Attorney
Robert C. Bonner says.
   ``We're quite pleased, and we hope that a fine of that magnitude
will send out a message to the defense industry that the federal
courts are taking defense procurement fraud very seriously,'' Bonner
said.
   U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall on Monday fined the
aerospace giant for overbilling the Pentagon for a navigation
satellite system. The judge also ordered Rockwell to pay restitution
of $446,248 and placed the company on probation for five years.
   Rockwell had pleaded guilty to conspiracy and contempt of court
but maintained that two high-level employees, not the company, were
responsible for the overcharges and a subsequent coverup. The
company said it would appeal the fine.
   The El Segundo-based company was fined for conspiring with some
of its managers to overbill the Air Force by nearly $500,000 on the
$1.2 billion NAVSTAR navigation satellite system between 1982 and
1984.
   Rockwell issued a statement reiterating its contention that the
overbilling was the responsibility of renegade employees acting in
what they perceived to be the company's benefit.
   ``Rockwell was sentenced today because of our responsibility
under the law for the acts of our employees,'' it said. ``We accept
that responsibility but we continue to believe that the company
itself should not have been indicted.''
   A Rockwell manager, Robert Zavodnik, 47, has pleaded guilty to
lying to the government and conspiracy in the case. He was sentenced
last month to a year of probation. His supervisor, Donald Carter,
60, was acquitted of the charges by a federal jury.
   The largest fine imposed on a defense contractor was $115 million
in 1988 against Sundstrand Corp.
   The Rockford, Ill., manufacturer of electronic, mechanical and
hydraulic systems for aircraft, was fined for its guilty plea to
four counts of defrauding the Defense Department by overbilling on
aircraft parts. The company admitted it had billed the department
for things like babysitting, country clubs and servants for its
executives.

   Biologist Mark Masteller leaned into
a razor-sharp wind and struggled through crusted snow in search of
yellow patches that one day may allow scientists to predict
nutritional problems in wildlife.
   Caribou scramble to escape the helicopter ferrying Masteller and
wildlife technician John Burch onto the frozen tundra in this remote
section of Denali National Park.
   Casting this way and that, Masteller and Burch checked
urine-stained snow that may have been left by the fleeing animals.
   ``That's too old, I think,'' said Masteller. ``That, too. Here's
a good one.'' He dropped to his knees, pulled out a stainless steel
spoon and began stuffing freshly soiled snow into a plastic bag.
   The two are gathering material for a predator-prey study
conducted by L. David Mech, a wolf researcher, and Layne Adams, a
National Park Service biologist.
   The work is aimed at finding some way for researchers to
determine the condition of wildlife by measuring the ratio of
chemicals normally found in urine, urea nitrogen and creatinine.
   Increased urea nitrogen would indicate the animal was
metabolizing more protein, either from food or from its own muscle
mass. For large hoofed animals in winter, metabolic rates decrease
and food intake is reduced. Ever-increasing amounts of urea nitrogen
in the urine indicate the animal may be in trouble.
   Using hand signals to direct the helicopter pilot, Burch listens
to electronic beeps picked up by antenna to zero in on randomly
selected radio-collared caribou. Mostly, the biologists seek out
cows. Bulls are too depleted by the rut before winter to give valid
samples later.
   ``Once they deplete their fat reserves, then they start
metabolizing protein at a more extensive rate,'' said Glenn
DelGiudice, a wildlife biologist specializing in nutrition and
physiology.
   ``Because they start burning up their body protein, you start
seeing high levels of urea nitrogen in the urine _ almost like they
become meat-eaters; almost like wolves.''
   DelGiudice and biochemist Ulysses S. Seal, both of the Veterans
Administration Medical Center research center in Minneapolis, are
running the study of frozen urine from Denali National Park, home of
Mount McKinley.
   ``We're in the early phases of the research; we would like to get
it more quantifiable,'' DelGiudice said. ``One of the things that
this will allow increasingly in the future is some forecasting
ability for wildlife managers. We've got a ways to go, but it's
looking very, very promising.
   ``I think it's going to enable us to detect subtle changes before
gross deterioration occurs,'' he said.
   For Alaska and other states with free-roaming herds of wildlife,
the research could have far-reaching effects, and ``there is no
reason it won't apply to every large herbivore,'' Adams said.
   ``Practically applied, it would allow for comparisons between
herds and track trends of animals' condition over time,'' he said.
``If you can determine changes in winter physical condition,
conceivably you could track that and it would allow you to adjust
management strategies.''

   Vice President Dan Quayle has come up with
enough government money to keep the Landsat earth-watching
satellites operating at least until a review of the program can be
completed, his spokesman says.
   The earth-sensing satellites were due to be turned off March 31,
when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would run
out of money to keep them going.
   NOAA needed $9.4 million to operate the satellites until the
fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.
   But emergency funding will come from departments that use Landsat
images _ State, Defense, Agriculture and Commerce _ as well as the
Office of Management and Budget, said Quayle spokesman David
Beckwith. Landsats scan the Earth with seven kinds of instruments,
giving detailed images of the land and vegetation.
   Beckwith said a review is being made of the satellite system.
   ``The plug won't be pulled before the review is completed,''
Beckwith said. ``The review will be completed prior to
(congressional) oversight of the FY 1990 NASA budget.''
   A House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee was conducting
a hearing this afternoon on the Landsat.
   Quayle is the new chairman of the National Space Council, which
studies the national space programs.
   Beckwith said he did not know how much money would be necessary
to keep the system operating until the end of the fiscal year, but
``it could be less (than $9.4 million) if we can implement some cost
economies.''
   The Reagan administration proposed no money for the current and
future fiscal years, but Congress restored enough to keep the
satellites operating until the end of the month.
   The Earth Observation Satellite Company, known as EOSAT,
currently operates two satellites, Landsats 4 and 5, which provide
photos for mineral exploration, checking soil conditions and
vegetation, urban and rural planning, monitoring volcanoes and
tracing ocean currents. Both satellites are well past their expected
lifetimes and are not fully operational, but they are providing
useful information.
   An improved satellite, Landsat 6, is under construction. That
project will continue because money was provided to complete and
launch that satellite.

<TEXT>
   Former Michigan National Corp. Chairman
Stanford Stoddard is free to re-enter the banking business under a
federal appeals court opinion lifting a ban by the Federal Reserve
Board.
   The decision was a victory for the 58-year-old Birmingham banker
in his four-year struggle to fight civil charges that he misused
bank funds.
   ``This should have ended four years ago. ... It should never have
started,'' Stoddard said Monday. ``I think my honesty ranks with
that of any officer who has ever served a bank in Michigan or the
U.S. I am guilty of mistakes in judgement, but I am not guilty of
dishonesty.''
   An attorney for the Federal Reserve said Monday that the opinion
overturning its ban on Stoddard would hinder efforts to clean up
abuses in banking.
   The Federal Reserve Board in January 1988 removed Stoddard from
his position as officer and director of the Detroit-area
bank-holding company and forbade him from engaging in future banking
activities.
   Stoddard, however, had resigned in July 1984 from his position as
the head of the bank his father founded. He left the banking company
nearly a year before the comptroller of the currency began
proceedings to remove him in an investigation of misuse of bank
funds.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, in an
opinion issued Friday, vacated the Federal Reserve Board's order,
saying the board's decision to dismiss Stoddard after his
resignation ``presents a linguistic _ and metaphysical _
impossibility.''
   ``One cannot remove what isn't there,'' said the opinion written
by Judge James Buckley.
   A Federal Reserve attorney, Douglas Jordan, said from an
enforcement standpoint, ``it creates a certain problem when someone
can resign and therefore elude jurisdiction.''
   The board had argued that Congress intended the removal provision
as a way of barring people who engaged in misconduct from returning
to the banking business.
   Stoddard's attorney, Keith Fisher, said his client ``seriously
wants to get back into the banking business.''
   ``In the current climate of troubled institutions all over the
country, someone of his enormous experience and talents would be
quite useful to any number of institutions,'' Fisher said.
   The comptroller of the currency, in recommending action against
Stoddard, said the bank officer used $167,385 of the institution's
funds for improper purposes.
   The agency said Stoddard used the money for renovation of
buildings that were or were to become Mormon churches; improvements
to his residence, vacation home and Florida condominium; payment of
bills for a wedding reception for his children and friends; and
extensive personal secretarial and errand services.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said today that
all countries, including poor Third World nations, must curb
ozone-destroying chemicals that she said threaten life on Earth.
   ``Simply to carry on as we are is not an option,'' said Mrs.
Thatcher at the end of a 120-nation conference on phasing out the
use of chlorofluorocarbons. The chemical compounds are used in
aerosol products, refrigerators and air conditioners.
   Her speech came after Prince Charles on Monday called for a
complete ban by century's end of the synthetic chemicals.
   The meeting began Sunday and 20 countries have since joined the
31 that signed the 1987 Montreal Protocol requiring that production
of the compounds chemicals be cut in half by the turn of the century.
   Mrs. Thatcher acknowledged that action on the compounds was
likely to begin in industrial nations.
   However, she added, ``It is not a case of some countries asking
other countries to act. It is a case of every country taking
action.''
   She said the world's people must ``change their customs and
habits in what they buy and what they do'' in order to ``overcome
one of the greatest challenges to life on Earth.''
   The compounds are stable and non-toxic when released into the
atmosphere, but when they rise 15-25 miles to the stratosphere, 10
to 100 years later, they break apart and their chlorine atoms
destroy the ozone shield that protects the Earth from the sun's
cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   The compounds also trap heat and warm global temperatures,
causing potentially major climate changes in a process known as the
greenhouse effect.
   In other remarks today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
chief William Reilly told reporters: ``I think we are all in this
together. We are all going to have to find ways to collaborate and
clear this mess up. It affects us all.''
   Delegates from China and India on Monday urged the industrial
nations to create a fund to help developing nations replace the
compounds with safe substitutes.
   Vladimir Zhakarov, head of the Soviet delegation, told the
conference Monday that his country needs more scientific evidence
that CFCs destroy the ozone layer before it will agree to speed up
its phaseout of such chemicals.
   ``If we take a decision which is not well-grounded, we can
interfere and destroy the economies of the developing countries,''
he said.
   The United States and the 12-nation European Economic Community
have said they will press for a total ban on the compounds by the
end of the century.
   Prince Charles said Monday that, ``There is surely an
overwhelming scientific case to change the (Montreal) treaty from a
reduction to complete elimination.''
   The heir to the British throne, who banned aerosols with the
compounds from his households last year, urged a consumer boycott of
products containing the chemicals.

<HEAD>Apple Unveils Macintosh IIcx And New Monitors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc., hoping to get back on
track after recent pricing blunders and a projected drop in earnings
this quarter, is unveiling a more compact but equally powerful
Macintosh computer and two large, extra-sharp monitors.
   The Macintosh IIcx was scheduled to make its debut today in a
glitzy teleconference broadcast from a San Francisco hotel to
customers, resellers, reporters and analysts in Chicago, New York,
Los Angeles, Dallas, Atlanta, Washington, Toronto, Sydney and
Hannover, West Germany.
   The Macintosh IIcx, the third member of the Macintosh family
announced in the last six months, features the Motorola 68030 and
68882 microprocessors, takes up less desk space than the earlier II
and IIx models and can be serviced and reconfigured more easily.
   ``I think the IIcx is a product that should have been in the
marketplace sooner,'' said Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht
&amp; Quist Inc. in San Francisco. ``It's probably the most appealing
offering in the Mac family and should do well.''
   He said sales of the Macintosh IIcx should begin making an impact
on Apple's earnings in the next quarter, since the company is set to
ship the computers immediately.
   Lupatkin had some reservations about the new computer's price.
   ``The product is priced a little bit expensively,'' he said.
``But I think it would have sported a much higher price had Apple
not had the difficulty it had'' when the company raised prices last
fall in response to a memory chip shortage. The result of that price
hike was a sharp drop in Mac II sales that is expected to hurt the
company this quarter.
   Apple said in January it expects its second quarter, ending March
30, will see earnings in the range of 35 cents to 45 cents per
share, compared with 61 cents per share for the same period last
year. In the first quarter, ended Dec. 30, the company earned $140.5
million, or $1.10 per share.
   The IIcx, which may eventually make the Mac II obsolete, is just
over 12 inches wide, compared with 18 inches for other Mac II
computers.
   It will be available in four configurations:
   _With one megabyte of memory and one floppy disk, selling for
$4,669.
   _With one megabyte of internal memory and a 40 megabyte hard disk
drive, selling for $5,369.
   _With four megabytes of memory and an 80 megabyte hard disk, for
$7,069.
   _A similar computer with four megabytes of memory, an 80 megabyte
hard disk and A-UX, Apple's version of the AT&amp;T Unix operating
system, for $7,552.
   One of the new high-resolution monitors Apple will show off has a
21-inch, two-page monochrome screen that measures 15 inches
horizontally by 11.3 inches vertically. It allows user to display
two pages side-by-side along with menus and scroll bars. The monitor
carries a suggested retail price of $2,149. Its companion video card
is priced at $599.
   The new Portrait Display, priced at $1,099, has a 15-inch
diagonal flat screen that can show an entire page of text and
graphics, including menus and scroll bars.

   The stock market declined slightly today, giving
back some of Monday's gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.96 to 2,292.86
in the first half hour of trading.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in

   Monday's advance was prompted in part by a monthly report from a
group of corporate purchasing executives that pointed to a slowing

   That was interpreted as a positive portent for the inflation
outlook and possibly a sign that upward pressure on interest rates
might ease.
   But analysts said some traders were fearful that the market might
get some contradictory evidence later this week when the Labor
Department issues its statistics on the employment situation for
February.
   Advance estimates call for the report, due out Friday, to show an
increase of about 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment.
   Microsoft tumbled 6] to 55| as the most active issue in the

<HEAD>Productivity Edged Up at Rate of 0.1 Percent From October Through
December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. workers' productivity edged up at a tiny
annual rate of 0.1 percent from October through December while unit
labor costs, a major inflation measure for business, shot up by 5.6
percent, the government reported today.
   The 0.1 percent rise in non-farm business productivity, output
per hour worked, continued a sawtooth pattern in effect for all of
last year with a strong gain in one quarter followed by a poor
showing in the next quarter.
   Productivity had risen at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the
first quarter of 1988 only to plunge at a rate of 2.4 percent in the
second quarter. It then rose at a 2 percent rate in the
July-September quarter only to slow to the miniscule 0.1 percent
advance in the final three months of the year.
   Of particular concern to economists were signs that tight labor
markets and high factory operating rates were beginning to show up
in inflationary pressures.
   Unit labor costs, which reflect changes in hourly compensation as
well as changes in productivity, rose at an annual rate of 5.6
percent in the fourth quarter, almost double the 3.7 percent rate of
increase in the third quarter.
   It was the biggest increase in unit labor costs since a 6.8
percent rise in the second quarter last year.
   The figures released today represented only slight revisions from
an initial productivity report issued a month ago. The 5.6 percent
rise in unit labor costs was unchanged from the prior report.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan cited the sharp
escalation of unit labor costs as one factor behind the central
bank's recent anti-inflation moves. The Fed is hoping that by
pushing up interest rates it will dampen demand enough to cool an
overheated economy and prevent an inflationary wage-price spiral
from taking hold.
   For the year as a whole, productivity increased 1.4 percent,
matching the average annual gain since the end of the 1981-82
recession.
   While the increase was up slightly from a 0.8 percent rise in
1987, it was still far below the 2 percent annual gains the Bush
administration is counting on in future years to shrink the $170
billion budget deficit to zero by 1993.
   Meeting the Bush targets for productivity is considered essential
to reaching the administration's optimistic projections for overall
growth of the economy without triggering higher inflation rates.

the two retailters.
   A statement said the transaction is subject to several
conditions, including approval by the holders of at least 80 percent
of Holmes' common stock and the ability of Holmes to cancel certain
other agreements within the next five days.
   Dillard owns 146 department stores in the central and
southwestern United States.
   Holmes operates 18 department stores and two clearance centers in
Alabama, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi.
   Under terms of the acquisition agreement, a Dillard subsidiary
would be merged into Holmes. Holmes' stockholders would receive
.244445 of a share of Dillard's Class A common stock for each share
of Holmes' stock. Currently, there are 3,562,062 shares of Holmes
common stock outstanding.
   The companies said Dillard had filed a registration statement
covering the 870,963 Dillard shares expected to be issued in
exchange for the Holmes shares. Holmes also granted Dillard an
option to purchase 450,000 of its authorized but unissued treasury
shares in exchange for 110,000 shares of Dillard's Class A common
stock.
   Dillard's obligation to close the merger is subject to its
receipt within the next five days of options from certain other
Holmes stockholders that would give Dillard the ability to control
Holmes as soon as the transaction is cleared by the Federal Trade
Commission.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   H.J. Heinz Co. said Tuesday it posted a 13.1
percent gain in third-quarter profit due to higher sales volume,
price increases and acquisitions.
   The Pittsburgh-based food giant said that for the three-month
period ended Jan. 25, net income totaled $103 million, or 78 cents a
share, up from $91.1 million, or 69 cents a share, for the year ago
period.
   Third-quarter sales increased 9.1 percent to $1.37 billion
compared with $1.25 billion for 1987.
   ``Higher volume, particularly in the domestic market, led our
sales growth,'' said Heinz President Anthony J.F. O'Reilly.
   ``In addition, we benefited from the acquisitions we made during
the last 12 months and from price increases, mainly in our overseas
markets,'' he said.
   Heinz packs and sells an extensive line of canned foods under
Heinz, Star-Kist, 9-Lives and Ore-Ida labels.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Heinz said its net
earnings increased 13.6 percent to $323 million, or $2.45 a share,
from $284.3 million, or $2.14 a share, in 1987.
   Sales for the first nine months increased 10.5 percent to $4.1
billion compared with $3.7 billion for the same period in 1987.
   Operating income increased 16.5 percent during the first nine
months to $587.1 million compared with $504.1 million in the same
1987 period. O'Reilly said the increase was attributable to higher
sales as well as the company's cost improvement programs.
   ``We are very pleased with our performance to this point, and we
believe that we are well on our way to our 25th consecutive year of
uninterrupted financial growth,'' O'Reilly said.

   The Fair Trade Commission raided trading companies
and their beef trade association Tuesday to investigate an alleged
cartel to push up prices of imported beef, officials said.
   Inspectors went to 29 trading companies, including Mitsubishi
Corp., Mitsui and Co., and C. Itoh and Co. Ltd., and to the Japan
Beef Importers' Association, said FTC spokesman Mitsuru Suzuki. All
29 companies belong to the 36-member semi-governmental Livestock

the share of imported beef each would sell to the LIPC before actual
bidding took place.
   ``By fixing each company's share, the cartel prevents free
competition in the market and raises beef prices,'' Suzuki said.
   The illegal practice no longer exists, but investigations under
the anti-cartel law can go into past actions, Suzuki said.
   A group of 36 beef importers arranges imports, pays tariffs and
sells their imported beef to the LIPC, which controls some 90
percent of beef imports.
   Japan imported 214,000 tons of beef in 1987 and 175,000 tons were
sold through the LIPC.
   When the issue of a suspected illegal cartel was raised last
August, the LIPC conducted its own investigation of member companies
at government order, said Shinzo Nakatani of the LIPC.
   ``We couldn't find anything that indicated the existence of
preliminary arrangements to fix shares,'' he added.
   An official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries said officials in the ministry's livestock department were
surprised to learn of the FTC raid.
   The ministry said in a statement that it would take strict
measures based on results of the FTC's investigation.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Turn Lower After Mixed Openeing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were trading mostly
lower this morning, against expectations, after a mixed opening on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Much of the selling pressure was coming from the soybean complex,
where some large speculators were cashing out after bidding soybean
meal prices up sharply late in Monday's session.
   But the soybean market's early losses were limited by buying
linked to a trade journal's report that the Soviet Union's imports
of soybean meal halfway through the current marketing year were
nearly double those of the same period a year ago.
   Wheat futures were nearly unchanged in early trading following
reports that the Agriculture Department, as expected, had accepted
China's bid for 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to } cent higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.35 a bushel; corn was 1
cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $2.78} a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1 cent higher with March at $2.09} a bushel; soybeans
were \ cent to 2} cents lower with March at $7.69 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .08 cent lower with April at 77.75

   Cattle futures finished mostly lower on Monday while pork futures

   Among developments today in the Eastern Airlines Machinists union
strike:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PILOTS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Line Pilots Association, asked all pilots nationwide,
beginning at 6 a.m. EST, to strictly follow aviation rules ``to
ensure the safety of the system,'' which it said had been weakened
by the Eastern disruptions. Union president Henry Duffy said the
action would slow air traffic, but insisted that was not the intent.
   In some cities bad weather delayed or canceled flights, and in
others there was little early indication of a slowdown.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>BUSH</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said pilots should not ``make the innocent
traveling public a pawn in this dispute,'' and stood by his
opposition to government intervention to stop the walkout.
   He also warned striking machinists that he will seek legislation
to forbid secondary boycotts if they picket other transportation
systems.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CONGRESS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The House Public Works Committee's aviation subcommittee is
considering a bill that would direct Bush to set up an emergency
panel to study issues in the strike. If enacted, the bill would stop
the strike for at least 60 days while the panel investigates issues
on both sides. Bush refused to take that action Friday before the
strike.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner appealed to Congress not
to force Bush to create the panel, saying the economic realities
should dictate the outcome and the Eastern strike alone ``does not
substantially disrupt this nation's transportation system.''
   Rep. James Oberstar, the subcommittee chairman, suggested that
the emergency panel legislation ``might give cover to the
administration'' for the action Bush refused to take. Oberstar
agreed the strike was not an ``emergency'' but called it part of ``a
long-term problem with broad implications for the airline industry.''

profitable routes _ its shuttle between Washington, New York and
Boston, and three round trips weekly between Miami, Buenos Aires,
Argentina, and Santiago, Chile.

   U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson issued a temporary
restraining order Monday against secondary picketing at Amtrak.
   The judge on Sunday issued a similar order against three major
rail lines that carry commuters between New York City and New
Jersey, Long Island and northern suburbs.
   Nine other commuter railroads nationwide and Amtrak had been
potential targets of sympathy actions. But the Machinists union said
it decided to appeal Patterson's orders and did not set up picket
lines at railroads Monday. A hearing on both rulings is scheduled
for Wednesday.

   The stock market showed a small loss today,
giving back some of Monday's gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 20.53 points on
Monday, dropped 1.07 to 2,293.75 by noontime today on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
566 up, 675 down and 553 unchanged.
   Monday's advance was prompted in part by a monthly report from a
group of corporate purchasing executives that pointed to a slowing
of economic growth in February.
   That was interpreted as a positive portent for the inflation
outlook and possibly a sign that upward pressure on interest rates
might ease.
   But analysts said some traders were fearful that the market might
get some contradictory evidence later this week when the Labor
Department issues its statistics on the employment situation for
February.
   Those worries were cited as a primary force behind a modest rise
in open-market interest rates today.
   Advance estimates call for the report, due out Friday, to show an
increase of about 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment.
   Ohio Mattress gained [ to 24} on top of a 2~-point gain Monday,
when the company agreed to a $25.50-a-share buyout by the investment
firm of Gibbons, Green, Van Amerongen.
   Microsoft tumbled 7\ to 54} as the most active issue in the

value index was up .31 at 328.30.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 83.40 million shares at noontime,
up from 73.35 million at the same point Monday.

<TEXT>
   ABOARD DELTA FLIGHT 839 (AP) _ Passengers and flight attendants
on one Delta Air Lines flight expressed exasperation today over a
potentially time-consuming job action implemented by pilots
nationwide in support of strikers at rival Eastern Airlines.
   The pilots union covering most U.S. carriers ordered members to
take enhanced safety procedures starting today because of safety
concerns it said have arisen out of the 4-day-old strike at the
troubled Miami-based Eastern.
   But if the views of people aboard a Delta flight from Miami to
Atlanta were any indication, that wasn't the pilots' only motive.
   ``I think they are doing it more out of sympathy,'' said
passenger Franco Licenzi, an engineer from Miami, after the cockpit
crew delayed takeoff for nearly a half an hour on the three-quarter
full flight because of what the captain called ``cargo loading.''
   A Delta flight attendant, who did not wish to be quoted by name,
said the same cargo loading delay had waylaid the flight for 20
minutes on an earlier Atlanta-to Miami run. The pilots declined to
talk with an Associated Press reporter aboard and made no
announcement to other passengers regarding the job action.
   ``It's just going to aggravate people all day long,'' said the
flight attendant, a 10-year Delta veteran. ``What's the point of
it?''
   She said ``I think it's solidarity for their union. It's just
they're little way of getting even.''
   Passenger Melton Johnston, a merchant marine ship captain en
route to Bermuda, said of the Eastern strike and the pilots'
sympathy action: ``I think it's in poor taste. Nobody wins.''
   The Eastern strike has been a boon to Atlanta-based Delta, which
in ordinary times is a highly profitable carrier that gets good
marks from passengers for service. Thousands of erstwhile Eastern
passengers have been re-booked on Delta flights since the strike
began Saturday.
   Despite the delay today, at least some passengers appeared not to
mind and directed their criticism toward Eastern, which has been
reeling from financial losses and chronic complaints about service.
   ``I hope Eastern goes out of business and Delta can buy their
routes,'' said a plastics company sales manager from Chicago who was
aboard the Miami-Atlanta flight.

<HEAD>GM Workers Return To Night Shift At Flint Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLINT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 General Motors Corp. employees at
the company's huge Buick City complex, some laid off since October
1987, are back at work after the automaker cranked up a second shift
on an assembly line.
   The workers, who returned to their night shift jobs Monday, were
met at the plant gate by Mayor Matthew S. Collier and some United
Auto Workers union officials.
   ``It makes me feel good that we'll be back for a while,'' said
welder Fay Deason of Flint, who had been laid off for about 13
months. ``Everybody seems to be happy to be back. I know I am.''
   The plant assembles full-size Buick LeSabres and Oldsmobile 88
Royale automobiles.
   GM spokeswoman Julie Hamp said the employee recall was spurred by
improving LeSabre sales. However, LeSabre sales are 13.4 percent
lower this model year compared with last and 43.4 percent lower for
the calendar year.
   In January, the factory began assembling Oldsmobile 88 Royale
automobiles. Production of that car was moved to Buick City from
GM's Willow Run assembly plant in Ypsilanti, Hamp said.
   LeSabres will make up about two-thirds with 88 Royales making up
the rest of the expected 1,040 cars a day produced by both shifts,
Hamp said. Production at the plant was idled between Dec. 23 and
Jan. 19 to retool for Oldsmobile production.
   The employee recall will bring to about 4,500 the number of
workers at the Buick City assembly plant.
   In October 1987, GM laid off about 2,000 workers because of
sagging LeSabre sales, Hamp said.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said Tuesday

   AT&amp;T Paradyne will be based in Largo, Fla., the headquarters of
Paradyne, which AT&amp;T announced in December it was buying for $250

   In keeping with its decentralization drive, AT&amp;T said it will set
up the subsidiary with its own board of directors and responsibility
for profits and losses. Paradyne lost $40.2 million in the nine
months ended last Sept. 30.

<HEAD>Judge Bars Amtrak Sympathy Walkout</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: ADDS new 6th graf to update with union filing appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge in Manhattan has temporarily
barred unionized Amtrak workers from staging a walkout in sympathy
with machinists striking at Eastern Airlines.
   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson at 3 p.m. Monday signed
the order barring an Amtrak walkout until at least 3 p.m. Wednesday.
At that time, he will conduct a hearing on whether to issue a longer
restriction.
   Amtrak lawyers had sought the restraining order.
   The judge signed a similar temporary restraining order Sunday
blocking unionized employees of the Long Island Rail Road, the
Metro-North Commuter Railroad and New Jersey Transit from staging
sympathy strikes in conjunction with the Eastern strike.
   The International Association of Machinists, which struck Eastern
on Saturday, has said it may picket at the railroads, and railroad
unions have said they would not cross those picket lines. That would
cripple rail transit.
   This morning, the union filed an appeal with the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals of Patterson's orders involving the local
railroads, and a hearing was set for Wednesday morning. The Amtrak
order was not mentioned in the appeal papers.
   Sheldon Engelhard, a lawyer for the union, said it would ask the
2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to hear an appeal of Patterson's orders
Tuesday. He said the machinists union is legally entitled to set up
secondary picket lines and the rail workers' contracts state they
can't cross picket lines.
   Union spokesman Jim Conley would not say if the union planned to
picket the railroads if the temporary restraining orders are lifted.
   ``That's part of the overall strike strategy and it won't be
released ahead of time,'' Conley said.

<HEAD>Former Fiat Executive Won't Begin With Ford Before July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. on Tuesday agreed not to use
Vittorio Ghidella's consulting services before July 1, following
consultations with Fiat, the Italian auto executive's former
employer.
   A Fiat spokesman said the decision was taken after talks in Turin
between representatives of the two auto giants in line with their
``good and correct relations.''
   Ghidella, who resigned late last year as operative head of Fiat's
auto sector, was expected to have started his relationship with Ford
by mid-February.
   Fiat objected to this arrangement because Ghidella, who formally
quit the Italian group on Dec. 31, had a contractual obligation not
to work for the competition for six months following the end of his
relationship with the Turin-based auto maker.
   Ghidella, who had played a key role in the impressive turnaround
of Fiat's auto sector in the 1980s, resigned following a dispute
over Fiat's strategy with Cesare Romiti, the managing director of
the Fiat group, which is controlled by the Agnelli family.
   Ghidella had emphasized Fiat's need to put more emphasis on the
auto sector to overcome growing competition from Japanese
manufacturers. Ford hired him to advise it on a wide range of
automotive initiatives, particularly in Europe.
   Three years ago the Italian and the U.S. company battled for the
takeover of Alfa Romeo, the Italian maker of luxury and sports cars.
Fiat prevailed following several months of tense negotiations.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today stood by his determination
to stay out of the Eastern Airlines strike as his transportation
secretary appealed to Congress not to force government intervention.
   ``It would be inappropriate for the government to intervene and
impose a solution,'' Bush told reporters at a White House briefing,
adding that the dispute should be resolved through the ``free
collective bargaining'' process.
   The president vowed to immediately seek legislation prohibiting
secondary boycotts should the Eastern dispute spill over to other
airlines or railroads. He urged the airline pilots union ``not to
make ... the innocent traveling public a pawn in this dispute.''
   Meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner appealed to
Congress not to force government intervention in the strike by
requiring the administration to impose a 60-day cooling-off period.
   ``It is far superior to allow the economic realities of the
dispute to dictate the outcome,'' Skinner told the House Public
Works and Transportation subcommittee on aviation.
   Skinner also called on pilots for other carriers not to take any
action supporting the Eastern strike. The Air Line Pilots
Association had asked its 40,000 members to closely follow rules
that could result in slowdowns at major airports.
   At the Capitol, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, called on Bush
``to provide national leadership'' by convening an emergency board
to help settle the Eastern strike. He said the National Mediation
Board has recommended such a panel 33 times in the last
half-century, and in each case the president has accepted the
recommendation.
   ``For President Bush summarily to reject the board's
recommendation and simply let things drift, as he has indicated his
intention to do, would be unprecedented,'' Wright said in a
statement he read to reporters.
   He said Bush ``can do as previous presidents have done, as
President Kennedy did in the steel crisis. That's leadership.''
   Wright said failure to establish an emergency board and set a
cooling-off period could at worst be ``a serious blow to the
economy, the loss of jobs for thousands of Americans and the further
concentration of monopoly and erosion of competition in the airline
industry. The nation cannot now afford such a risk.''
   Skinner testified that government action could neither solve the
dispute nor save Eastern from bankruptcy. But he said he hoped the
airline and union would reach agreement on their own.
   The secretary said Eastern flew only 62 of its scheduled 1,057
flights on Monday. He said Pan American added 20 flights and Delta
five to make up for the cancelled Eastern routes, but there were 970
fewer flights throughout the nation overall because of the shutdown.
   The subcommittee is considering a bill that would direct Bush to
set up an emergency panel to study issues in the strike. Bush could
veto the measure, but Congress has the power to override his
disapproval.
   If enacted, the bill would stop the strike for at least 60 days
while the panel investigates issues on both sides. Bush refused to
take that action before the 12:01 a.m. Saturday end of a federally
imposed cooling-off period.
   Skinner said a presidential emergency board would be ``wholly
inappropriate.''
   ``The plain fact of the matter is that a strike at Eastern alone
does not substantially disrupt this nation's transportation
system,'' he said. But Skinner said if a boycott of other airlines
takes place, the administration is prepared to introduce a bill to
outlaw such activities.
   Skinner said the administration opposes a measure that would
force an end to the strike because it believes in free enterprise
and wants to ensure that U.S. industries remain ``as competitive as
possible to maintain our place in the world.''
   He said the economic deregulation of transportation has ``reaped
untold benefits.''
   The White House has said it might submit a bill that would ban
Eastern Airlines employees from picketing other airlines.
   But key Democrats said they would ask the aviation subcommitteeto
to give quick approval to legislation directing Bush to set up an
emergency panel to study issues in the strike.
   The creation of a panel would also compel Eastern for 60 days to
continue paying salaries in effect prior to the walkout. The
airline, which shut down nearly all its operations on Monday, claims
it was losing $1 million a day and cannot afford to operate without
$150 million in annual pay cuts.
   Bush followed management urgings in refusing to step in.
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that as long as
Eastern's striking Machinists union members refrain from picketing
other airlines or railways, ``we wouldn't find it necessary to send
up the legislation'' barring such secondary action.
   But Fitzwater said the administration is prepared ``to move
rapidly to submit the legislation if the secondary boycott occurs.''
   The spokesman said Bush is receiving ``daily briefings'' on the
situation and still believes the dispute can best be resolved by the
company and the union in negotiations rather than through government
intervention.
   But Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., suggested that the emergency
panel legislation he and committee chairman Rep. Glenn Anderson,
D-Calif., drew up ``might give cover to the administration'' for the
action Bush refused to take.
   Oberstar, aviation subcommittee chairman, did not contend that
the strike had reached ``emergency'' proportions. But he called it
part of ``a long-term problem with broad implications for the
airline industry.''
   ``If not an emergency, this is a matter of great public
interest,'' he said.
   Skinner said Monday that the ``private labor dispute should be
allowed to follow its normal course'' without boycotts of other
companies.
   ``Both sides need to get this issue resolved and get on with the
business of this country and serving its customers,'' Skinner said.
   The secretary said he called the heads of other major airlines
and asked them to help passengers affected by Eastern cancellations.

   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the world's
largest diamond producer, said Tuesday its profits doubled last
year, but predicted a slowdown in world economic growth would cut
into 1989 sales.
   The year-end results showed that net attributable earnings
amounted to 2.090 billion rand, or $877 million, from 1.035 billion
rand a year earlier. De Beers chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson said
revenue rose strongly, helped by a 13.5 percent price increase in
May last year. He said there had been a slight slowdown in sales to
the Japanese market towards the end of the year, apparently due to
Emperor Hirohito's illness at the time.
   De Beers results follow the announcement earlier this year by the
group's marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, that sales
of rough gem and industrial diamonds by the organization totalled
$4.17 billion in 1988, up 35.7 percent from 1987's total of $3.08
billion.

<TEXT>
   Up to 670 production workers from Lockheed Corp.
will be loaned to Boeing Co. to help build Boeing's new 747-400, the
world's largest passenger jet, Boeing said Tuesday.
   Boeing said it was nearing final agreement with Lockheed on an
``industry assist contract'' that would bring experienced Lockheed
workers to the 747-400 production line in Everett for up to six
months.
   Under a preliminary agreement, an initial contingent of 26
Lockheed workers reported to the plant Tuesday. They will undergo
five days of certification training required by the Federal Aviation
Administration to qualify them for working on Boeing aircraft, the
company said.
   Last week, stock prices for both Boeing and Lockheed rose after
Business Week magazine quoted unidentified sources as saying Boeing
might be interested in buying the California-based company.
   Boeing officials declined to comment on that report, but some
stock analysts discounted the speculation, saying it was unlikely
Boeing would want to take on new challenges when it already faces
delays and production problems in its commercial airplane division.
   Lockheed, a major aerospace defense contractor based in
Calabasas, Calif., stopped making commercial jets in the mid-1980s.
Its last commercial jet was the L-1011 TriStar, a three-engine
widebody jet that went into service in 1972.
   Boeing has suffered repeated delays in bringing out the 747-400,
but started making deliveries earlier this year. With record orders
for new business, the company also has had problems finding enough
new skilled workers.
   ``Securing the assistance of the experienced Lockheed employees
is one of the many steps we are taking toward meeting the new
747-400 delivery commitments we have made to our customers,'' Boeing
Commercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton said. ``Other Boeing
organizations also are helping us by reassigning some of their
experienced employees to the 747-400 program.''
   Boeing said the Lockheed workers who reported to Boeing are
flight line and assembly mechanics and electricians. They average
nine years of service with Lockheed.
   Lockheed also is to provide electronics installers, quality
control inspectors, methods analysts and production planners.
   Lockheed ranked eighth in defense contracts in fiscal 1988, with
$3.54 billion, while Boeing was 10th at $3 billion, according to
Pentagon figures.

   The stock market was little changed today,
hesitating after Monday's strong gain.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 20.53 points on
Monday, inched up another 1.25 to 2,296.07 by 2 p.m. today on Wall
Street.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 689 up, 667
down and 532 unchanged.
   Monday's advance was prompted in part by a monthly report from a
group of corporate purchasing executives that pointed to a slowing
of economic growth in February.
   That was interpreted as a positive portent for the inflation
outlook and possibly a sign that upward pressure on interest rates
might ease.
   But analysts said some traders were fearful that the market might
get some contradictory evidence later this week when the Labor
Department issues its statistics on the employment situation for
February.
   Those worries were cited as a primary force behind a modest rise
in open-market interest rates today.
   Advance estimates call for the report, due out Friday, to show an
increase of about 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment.
   Time Inc. jumped 8 to 115{. Analysts cited speculation that the
company, in reaching its weekend agreement to merge with Warner
Communications, might have opened itself up to a takeover bid from
some other direction.
   Microsoft tumbled 8{ to 53{ as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. The company said it expects to report lower
earnings for its fiscal third quarter ending March 31.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .06 to 165.57. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .64 at 328.63.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 121.77 million shares with two

   Federal Express Corp. will launch on April
1 an overnight service that delivers documents and small packages in
the afternoon instead of midmorning at a slightly reduced rate, the
company said Tuesday.
   The new FedEx Standard Overnight service promises next-afternoon
delivery for packages up to 5 pounds, arriving by 3 p.m. in most
areas or 4 p.m. in more remote locations. The current Priority
Overnight delivery program promises deliveries by 10:30 a.m. in most
locations.
   ``We saw a niche in the market for those people wanting a lower
cost service for next-day delivery, but not necessarily next-morning
delivery. We already have a priority overnight service,'' spokesman
Armand Schneider said Tuesday.
   For letter delivery, the company said its door-to-door list price
of from $8.25 to $11.25 would be the lowest in the industry. United
Parcel Service, for example, charges at least $8.50 for its next-day
air service.
   ``Test marketing of the new product in six cities confirmed that
many customers who use our competitors do so when price is the prime
factor,'' said Carole A. Presley, senior vice president for
marketing and communications.
   The door-to-door list price for packages would range from $12.50
for a 1-pound package to $16.50 for a 5-pound package, the company
said.

   Eastern Airlines today laid off an additional 2,500 employees
because it has no work for them in the fourth day of a Machinists
strike that has crippled the airline but failed to disrupt air
traffic nationwide.
   ``We simply don't have any business on the books today,'' Joe
Leonard, Eastern executive vice president, said at a news
conference. ``Our competitors have simply been sucking up the
traffic, our traffic since March 4.''
   Leonard said the airline was forced to halt nearly all its
operations because its pilots had firmly supported the 8,500-member
Machinists union, which represents mechanics and ramp service
workers.
   ``If our pilots had come to work, this strike would be over,'' he
said. ``We could have easily flown through a machinists strike.''
   The nation's airline pilots today began a job action that had
threatened to clog air travel on most airlines, but few delays were
reported by noon.
   Eastern Airlines on Monday sent more than 7,000 non-striking
employees home, and Leonard said today that just 1,500 employees
remain working, down from from 31,200 before the strike. The airline
had announced Monday it sent home 5,000 workers, but today Leonard
said the figure actually was 7,000.
   Leonard reiterated that a move to bankruptcy court was a last
resort, and said, ``We don't have any plans to throw in the towel.''
   Flights were slightly delayed at some airports this morning, but
officials said it was too early to know whether to blame bad
weather, normal delays or a nationwide pilots' effort to strictly
adhere to all regulations.
   ``The reports we have are that there has been no effect on
operations,'' said Capt. Roger Hall, a national spokesman for the
Air Line Pilots Association. The union continues to contend it is
not conducting a slowdown, but is adapting to ``highly unusual
circumstances'' it says threaten safety.
   This morning in Washington, President Bush said pilots should not
``make the innocent traveling public a pawn'' and stood by his
opposition to government intervention to stop the Machinists union
walkout.
   In New York today, unions representing workers at three suburban
rail lines that serve more than 300,000 commuters appealed a court
order barring them from honoring any picket lines the Machinists set
up at railways. A hearing was set for Wednesday.
   Lawyers for the Machinists and the Brotherhood of Railroad
Signalmen asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn an
order by U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson. Patterson today
extended his order, which had been effective until 3 p.m. EST
Wednesday, to midnight Friday. It bars workers at those commuter
lines from walking off the job in sympathy with strikers.
   The Eastern strike, which began Saturday and culminated a
17-month labor dispute, grounded most of the airline's flights,
stranded thousands of passengers and pushed the nation's
seventh-largest airline to the brink of collapse. The airline wants
$150 million in concessions; the Machinists want $50 million in
raises.
   ``We cannot run an airline with unpredictability,'' Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell told reporters in Miami. ``We cannot continue
to inconvenience passengers. We cannot afford the steady financial
drain.''
   Matell said Eastern would continue only its most profitable
routes _ its shuttle between Washington, New York and Boston, and
three round trips weekly between Miami, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and
Santiago, Chile.
   Full-page advertisements for Eastern today in The New York Times,
The Washington Post and The Boston Globe urged ``Fly Us With No
Reservations'' and promised that the shuttle is operating every hour.
   Henry Duffy, president of the ALPA, asked its 40,000-member
pilots nationwide, beginning at 6 a.m. EST today, to adhere to rules
``to ensure the safety of the system,'' which he said had been
weakened by the Eastern disruptions.
   As the workday began, air traffic was not crippled.
   ``Everything's quiet,'' said Mildred Schneider, spokeswoman for
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the
three major New York-area airports. Asked if pilots were conducting
a slowdown, she said, ``No one has given me that indication.''
   The U.S. Department of Transportation set up a special control
center in Washington to monitor the ALPA action. By 10:30 a.m. EST,
no unusual delays were reported, said spokesman Hal Paris, adding,
``We won't have anything until this afternoon, probably late
afternoon.''
   By 8:30 a.m. EST, no delays were posted on flight-status boards
at counters of major carriers at Miami International Airport.
   National Airport flights began as usual at 7 a.m., and some
flights took off, said Dave Hess, spokesman for the Metropolitan
Washington Airport Authority. ``We won't have a handle on this until
mid-day,'' he said about any possible disruption.
   ``If there a slowdown here, we can't see it,'' said John Braden,
spokesman at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport. ``We have so
much excess capacity because Eastern's not flying we can absorb any
such delays anyway.''
   Federal Aviation Administration inspectors have been monitoring
Eastern closely and have found no safety lapses, said Anthony
Broderick, FAA associate director. He said the agency was prepared
to deal with the pilots' action.
   On Monday, Eastern asked a federal judge in Miami to order its
pilots to cross Machinist union picket lines. A hearing was
scheduled today.
   Eastern canceled almost all flights Monday, although some
Northeast shuttle flights left despite a snowstorm in the New York
City area. Pan Am Corp. doubled its rival hourly shuttle service to
take advantage of Eastern's troubles.
   Matell said the 5,000 to 6,000 idled non-union employees were
notified immediately of their ``no-work'' status and would receive
lump-sum payments from $270 to $640, depending on their wages. They
include ticket and reservations agents, clerical workers, customer
service workers and some managers.
   ``My father went to work for Eastern in 1949, the year I was
born,'' said gate agent Steve Moss in Atlanta. ``This company has
raised me from a child. And all I can say is that now I'm ashamed
about what the current management has done to Eastern.''
   Some of those laid off joined striking Eastern Machinists on
picket lines.
   Matell said about 200 pilots out of 3,600 were flying, but the
pilots union put the number at 88.
   ``We're not the ones who sought the strike,'' said John J. Bavis,
head of the Eastern Air Line Pilots Association local. ``This is a
strike that Mr. Lorenzo called.''
   The anti-union reputation of Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's
parent Texas Air Corp., has galvanized Eastern's unionized employees.
   Eastern's 5,900 flight attendants also have honored the
Machinists strike.
   Before the strike, Miami-based Eastern claimed losses of more
than $1 billion during the last decade, and $1 million daily. It
also said it had $2.5 billion in debts stemming from its acquisition
by Texas Air Corp. in 1986.

   Compaq Computer Corp.'s only foreign
factory soars above the Scottish countryside outside Glasgow, a
giant glass-metal structure that looks unique. It isn't.
   The Compaq plant is modeled on the company's Houston
headquarters. Its parent company is one of 275 American businesses
operating in Scotland.
   The Scots historically have been highly successful in attracting
foreign businesses, although the pace of overseas investment has
slackened in the past few years. They hope the pace will accelerate
again ahead of 1992, when the European Economic Community is to
become one barrier-free marketplace.
   Investment has meant a great deal to Scotland's hard-hit economy
in the 1980s, creating jobs where the unemployment rate is 10.3
percent. But foreign owners of Scottish factories have been
criticized for creating a segment of the economy that thrives on
low-skilled assembly jobs.
   ``For the large companies 1992 will not come as a big surprise.
They were already here. What we are talking about here are the
small- to medium-sized companies for whom expansion in Europe would
be the next logical step,'' said Robert Crawford, a Scottish
Development Agency official.
   Many companies are establishing a presence in Europe, by setting
up manufacturing operations or arranging joint ventures and
licensing agreements to ensure they're not shut out of the single
European market of 320 million consumers when 1992 arrives.
   The largest share of investment in Scotland has come from the
United States, much of it in electronics, which has created a
``Silicon Glen.''
   It is the largest such concentration in Europe, stretching from
Prestwick to Dundee in the central part of Scotland, where most of
the 5.1 million population lives.
   Investment in 1987-88 totaled $580 million and created more than
6,700 jobs, vs. a $1.2 billion invesmtment credited with creating
nearly 8,200 jobs in 1984-85, government statistics show. The U.S.
share in the latest year totaled $194 million, which created or
safeguarded about 3,600 jobs.
   Scotland tries to attract companies in electronics and health
care, where it already has a substantial infrastructure that gives
investors easy access to components and research.
   Scotland also sells the experience of existing American companies.
   ``We're very, very comfortable with the decision that took Compaq
to establish in Scotland,'' said Eddie McGowan, a Compaq manager. He
said the company already has expanded operations at the 10-month-old
plant.
   Scotland's promoters also boast that the work force is cheap
compared with those of West Germany and other European countries.
Moreover, they say Scots are highly educated and readily available
because of the high jobless rate.
   The English language also is a big factor in attracting American
investors, experts said.
   ``It's not just language. It's language and culture. The
Americans find the work force very similar to the work force in
America,'' Crawford said.
   Nonetheless, many overseas entrepreneurs remain skeptical of
doing business here. For one thing, Scotland is remote, separated
from the European continent by water. Critics also contend the
Scottish workforce is not as cheap, flexible and well educated as
the government officially proclaims.
   Gordon Hughes, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, said
large Japanese companies such as Nissan Motor Co. and Sony Corp.
have preferred to establish factories in northeast England and Wales.
   Another problem is what business executives call a history of
union stubbornness in Scotland. Ford Motor Co., for example,
abandoned plans to build an electronics plant in Dundee last year
because of labor opposition to a single union there.
   ``We certainly have lost a lot of economic opportunity because of
union intransigence,'' said John Davidson, Scottish director of the
Confederation of British Industry.
   In addition, some critics worry that foreign companies aren't
transplanting their decision-making and research work to Scotland.
Others say only a narrow range of overseas-based industries are
setting up here, leaving the Scots vulnerable if those industries
suffer downturns.
   ``There's been a high mortality rate of plants that came here in
the 1960s and 1970s that didn't survive the '80s when the
electronics industry slowed down,'' Hughes said.

   President Bush on Tuesday virtually ruled out
intervening in the Eastern Airlines strike, saying ``man-to-man
negotiation'' is preferable to a government-imposed settlement.
   While he didn't flatly rule out stepping in to end the walkout,
Bush said his policy ``will hold firm'' despite pressure in some
congressional quarters to force him to act.
   The president had spare time in his schedule Tuesday because
inclement weather forced him to cancel a planned trip to Lancaster,
Pa., and Wilmington, Del., for speeches on his plans to attack drug
abuse.
   As he stepped to the White House podium, Bush's transportation
secretary, Samuel Skinner, was on Capitol Hill urging lawmakers not
to pass legislation that would force Bush's hand on the Eastern
strike. Under a provision of the Railway Labor Act, he could stop
the walkout for 60 days while a presidentially-appointed panel
investigated the dispute.
   House Speaker Jim Wright responded that Bush's refusal to halt
the strike by appointing an investigative panel ``would be
unprecedented,'' noting that over the last half-century 33 such
boards have been named in transportation disputes.
   Bush, however, used his opening news conference statement to
``restate my belief that free collective bargaining is the best
means of resolving'' the strike.
   He exhorted Eastern management, the Machinists union and other
unions to conduct ``head-on-head, man-to-man negotiation'' and said
he thought that would be ``better and more lasting ... than an
imposed government settlement, which could cause the airline to
totally shut down.''
   Bush urged pilots threatening a sympathy slowdown in support of
the strike not to ``make the innocent traveling public a pawn in
this dispute.'' He reiterated that if the machinists try to shut
down rail service he will ask Congress to ban such secondary
boycotts.
   ``It is not fair to say to a commuter on a train coming in from
Long Island that you're going to be caught up and victimized by a
strike affecting an airline,'' he said. ``Simply isn't fair.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed moderately lower
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting concerns about the
imminent arrival of new supplies from the record-large Brazilian
soybean crop.
   Grain futures finished narrowly mixed as spillover selling from
the soybean complex was offset by bullish forecasts for relatively
dry weather in the Plains and Midwest, analysts said.
   The soybean harvest in Brazil, the world's second-largest
producer after the United States, is expected to be the largest
ever, despite a spate of unusually hot, dry weather early in the
growing season.
   Analysts said the first soybeans from the new Brazilian crop
could move into processing channels this week, partially alleviating
the tight-supply situation caused by last summer's drought in the
United States.
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that cool temperatures in
portions of the central and southern Plains last week had slowed
winter wheat growth, which added to the bullish outlook for the
wheat market.
   At the close, wheat was 2} cents lower to 2{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.34 a bushel; corn was 1{
cents lower to 2 cents higher with March at $2.78\ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 1{ cents higher with March at $2.10 a bushel;

   A former officer of the defunct State
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Corvallis has pleaded guilty
to a federal charge in connection with a scheme to breach loan
limits and circumvent federal banking regulations.
   Ronald Lee Koos, the thrift's former secretary and legal counsel,
entered his plea on Monday in U.S. District Court before Judge Owen
M. Panner. Panner set sentencing for May 1.
   Koos, 36, of Albany pleaded guilty to a charge of making a false
statement to influence the thrift to make a $12.2 million loan. He
also agreed to cooperate with the government and to testify against
other defendants in the case.
   In exchange, prosecutors agreed to seek a two-year prison
sentence and dismissed other charges, including aiding and abetting
interstate wire fraud, aiding and abetting bank fraud and
embezzlement, aiding and abetting misapplication of bank funds and
perjury.
   The thrift was closed in December 1985 by federal regulators
after losing about $100 million in loans to ``straw'' borrowers
allegedly associated with Thomas Edward Nevis, a 46-year-old Texas
real estate developer also charged in the scheme. The thrift was
reopened as Freedom Federal Savings and Loan Association.
   Nevis and two other defendants set for trial in U.S. District
Court in early May, according to assistant U.S. Attorney Lance
Caldwell.

<HEAD>Texaco U.S.A. Forms Two Exploration and Producing Regions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco U.S.A. announced Tuesday it would form two
major exploration and producing regional organizations and
streamline its operations in an effort to boost sagging production
profits.
   James L. Dunlap, president of Houston-based Texaco U.S.A., said
the new regions to be headquartered in Denver and New Orleans are
part of a major restructuring announced by Texaco Inc. last year and
reflect a ``refocused business strategy.''
   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., recently completed the sale
of more than $7 billion in assets following its emergence from
bankruptcy protection last year. The restructuring has reduced the
size of the nation's third largest oil concern and focused its
attention on exploration and production rather than refining and
marketing.
   The two new regions and 12 divisions will replace the Texaco
subsidiary's existing 26 offices that currently employ about 7,300
people nationwide, company spokesman Paul Weeditz said.
   He said some employee relocations and reductions were expected,
but, ``We're uncertain at this point as to the ultimate impact on
employment.''
   Specific plans for the restructuring are expected to be completed
by the end of the year.
   ``The idea is to move the decision point as close to the wellhead
as possible, so that each division operates as would a successful
independent company, making its own operating decisions with minimum
review at other management levels while being accountable for its
own performance,'' Dunlap said.
   The New Orleans-based region, or the East Region, will be
responsible for the company's onshore and offshore exploration and
production in the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard areas.
   The Denver-based region, or the West Region, will be responsible
for those activities in the Mid-Continent, West Coast and other
areas.
   Vice President William Wallace will head the New Orleans-based
region, while Vice President L. Paul Teague will head the western
region. Both will report to Gerald F. Rome in Houston, the executive
vice president of exploration, producing and gas.
   The East Region's five units will include two exploration and
exploitation divisions based in New Orleans and two producing
divisions, with one in Harvey, La., and the other in Morgan City,
La. The fifth division, also based in New Orleans, will be
responsible for producing properties owned by Texaco but operated by
others.
   The West Region's seven units will include producing divisions in
Bakersfield, Calif., Ventura, Calif., Midland, Texas and Denver; two
exploration and exploitation divisions in Denver; a division in
Denver that will be responsible for Texaco-owned properties operated
by others; and an exploitation unit in Midland.
   Dunlap noted that the Natural Gas Department, Texaco U.S.A.'s
other major ``upstream,'' or exploration and production, business,
may be in for some restructuring in the future.

<HEAD>Gulf &amp; Western Reports First Quarter Profit Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gulf &amp; Western Inc. Tuesday reported a 7 percent
gain in first-quarter profit compared with the previous year,
although earnings would have fallen except for unusual items.
   For the three-month period ended Jan. 31, Gulf &amp; Western said its
net earnings totaled $69.2 million, or 58 cents a share, up from
$64.7 million, or 54 cents a share, in the 1988 quarter. Revenue
totaled $1.35 billion, up 14 percent from $1.18 billion in the
year-earlier period.
   New York-based Gulf &amp; Western's three operating segments are
publishing, consumer and commercial lending, and entertainment,
including Paramount Pictures, Madison Square Garden and theater
circuits.
   The company said first-quarter results included $5.1 million
stemming from an accounting change related to the recognition of
finance income and a one-time gain of $5.6 million from the sale of
a 50 percent interest in the company's domestic theater operations.
   The accounting change related to finance income should continue
to add about $5 million a quarter to earnings over the next two to
three years, the company said. Without that gain and the gain on the
sale, earnings would have dropped.
   Gulf &amp; Western said total receivables in its consumer-commercial
finance unit exceeded $13 billion for the first time, led by healthy
advances in consumer real estate lending.
   Motion picture operating income was strong but television
operations posted the largest percentage gains due in part to the
popularity of ``Webster'' and ``Star Trek: The Next Generation,''
Gulf &amp; Western said.
   However, the company's Simon &amp; Schuster publishing unit recorded
a loss in consumer operations despite strong sales of some hardcover
bestsellers. The losses reflected higher product support expenses,
the company said.

   Energy futures prices headed lower in moderate
trading Tuesday, reversing the previous session's modest gains.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled 37 cents lower
at $18.30 a barrel, after rising 11 cents on Monday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
April contract for wholesale home heating oil settled 0.35 cent
lower at 51.08 cents a gallon, following a 0.63 cent gain the
previous session.
   April unleaded gasoline, which rose 0.60 cent Monday, ended down
0.18 cent at 51.41 cents a gallon.
   Peter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elder Futures Inc.,
attributed Tuesday's decline largely to technical factors prior to
the release of the latest American Petroleum Institute report.
   The report, put out after the market closed, showed a sharp
increase in crude oil supplies but a decline in supplies of heating
oil and gasoline.

<TEXT>
   This airport bedroom community,
founded by aviation pioneer Glen Curtiss, was hit especially hard
when Eastern Airlines idled 9,500 employees in last two days.
   Pedro Hidalgo has owned the Eldorado jewelry shop for eight years
in the corner of the central drug store in this city of 12,000 on
the edge of Miami International Airport. Now he wonders if he'll be
looking for a new job soon.
   Open for 2{ hours Tuesday, Hidalgo went to his desk to locate his
only receipt for the day _ a $2 repair.
   ``By this time of day, I was usually crowded and people were
waiting outside,'' said Hidalgo. ``My survival amount to cover
everything is $100 a day. Yesterday I made $62.''
   He feels the strike by the Machinists union against money-losing
Eastern is to blame.
   Shopkeepers around the downtown traffic circle estimate 40
percent to 60 percent of their business comes from the airline
industry and a significant segment of that from Eastern, whose
headquarters is just outside the city.
   Betty Russell, a newsstand employee at the airport for 17 years,
was wondering how much longer the airport concession would keep her
shop open in the nearly deserted Eastern terminal.
   ``I live in the Springs, and practically all the people that live
in the Springs work for Eastern,'' she said.
   At one point, she called the strike by the 8,500-member
Machinists union ``very foolish'' but, no matter what happens, she
concluded, ``Nobody's going to win.''
   Her employer already has closed stores on Eastern's shuttered
boarding ramps and is pushing its workers to take vacations or shift
to a four-day work week.
   ``I've been here 17 years and I make $5 an hour. I always say
half a loaf is better than nothing,'' she said. ``It's going to be a
sad thing down here in Miami. It's bad.''
   Ticket agents and skycaps who on Monday were placed on what
Eastern calls ``no-work status'' were called in Tuesday morning for
a meeting with management.
   A supervisor told them they could apply for unemployment benefits
but could be called back at any time. Their medical insurance
expired at midnight Monday, no vacation pay would be considered, and
questions about early retirement went unanswered.
   The ``no-work status'' means ``we hope it's a shorter term, in
other words, that we hope we'll be able to call them back to work,''
said Eastern spokeswoman Bobbi Giordano. ``We're hoping that they'll
be coming back, so that's where that stands.''
   Iza Emmett, a 24-year Eastern veteran who had been working in
international passenger services, hugged co-workers and wiped away
tears as she headed to pick up a paycheck.
   ``We don't get vacation pay, we don't get severance pay, we don't
get anything,'' she said.
   ``They're upset, very upset, because they want to know what's
happening in the future,'' said ramp service manager Joseph Brazeau,
a 23-year Eastern veteran.
   Skycap Red Bloise resents both Eastern and President ``George
`Ostrich' Bush, because he has his head in the ground.''
   ``They're giving us this no-work status garbage because this way
they don't have to give us the stuff we've earned,'' the 10-year
veteran said as he left for home and his children. ``Now that we're
out of a job, we won't even get to Disney World.''
   Joseph Leonard, Eastern's chief operating officer, said the
workers were laid off, but workers were told they had been placed on
``no-work status,'' eligible for unemployment benefits but without
severance pay, vacation pay, medical insurance or answers to
questions about early retirement.
   ``The difference is that we hope it's a shorter term, in other
words, that we hope we'll be able to call them back to work,'' said
Eastern spokeswoman Bobbi Giordano. ``We're hoping that they'll be
coming back, so that's where that stands.''
   In Miami Springs, Marilynn Yoss, whose grandmother worked for
Eastern, said she couldn't be anything but optimistic.
   ``I think that's the only attitude you can take is be positive,''
she said while filling orders at a gift shop filled with Easter
baskets, colorful balloons and St. Patrick's Day fare.
   Others weren't so enthusiastic.
   Fred White, operator of Circle Barber Shop and a real estate
agent, recalls airline workers mowing lawns and taking jobs pumping
gas in previous strikes.

<HEAD>Agency Says Confusion Between Pedals Is Likely Cause of Sudden Acceleration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most likely cause of cases of sudden
acceleration involving the Audi 5000 and other cars is drivers
stepping on the wrong pedal, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said Tuesday.
   The agency, however, said drivers may not be to blame for
confusion between accelerator and brake. The difficulty in selecting
the right pedal may be ``aggravated by vehicle design,'' the agency
said.
   A yearlong study of sudden acceleration, conducted by the
agency's Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, Mass., found
that a car can suddenly speed up to full power only if the throttle
is opened almost completely to provide oxygen to the engine.
   Other proposed theories of sudden acceleration, such as problems
with the cruise control or electronic idle speed control systems,
failed to meet the test of an open throttle while the brakes are
applied, NHTSA said.
   NHTSA has conducted more than 100 investigations of unwanted
acceleration involving 20 manufacturers since the late 1970s.
   The agency's investigations of the problem have resulted in 26
recalls and manufacturers have conducted another 75 recalls.
   A major sudden acceleration case involved the West German-made
Audi. In late 1986 the company recalled about 250,000 of its
5000-series automobiles for installation of a ``shift-lock'' device,
which prevents the transmission from being put into forward or
reverse without the brake pedal being depressed.
   Audi spokesman Joseph Bennett said in Detroit that the report
``is a breath of fresh air as far as we're concerned.''
   ``While the Transportation Center chose to use the term `pedal
misapplication,' we feel that it is fundamentally what we've been
saying,'' Bennett said.
   He was skeptical that design factors in the Audi could have
contributed to confusion among pedals.
   ``Our pedals are optimized for braking efficiency, for driver
control,'' Bennett said. ``These cars are designed to be driven on
autobahns at 100 mph plus.''
   The Center for Auto Safety, a critic of the auto industry,
declined comment until it could see a copy of the report.
   NHTSA rejected the conclusion of a Canadian study and some
automakers that sudden acceleration was due to driver error.
   ```Driver error' may imply carelessness or willfulness in failing
to operate a car properly,'' NHTSA said. ```Pedal misapplication' is
more descriptive of what occurs. It could happen to even the most
attentive driver who inadvertently selects the wrong pedal and
continues to do so unwittingly.''
   A report by Transport Canada, issued in January, concluded that
sudden acceleration ``occurs as a result of driver error.''
   Pedal placement, shape and feel may be factors that lead drivers
to press the wrong pedal, NHTSA said.
   However, the agency said proposals for any design changes must
await further research.
   Complaints of sudden acceleration are based on instances when
cars allegedly go to full power from a standstill or slow speed,
usually after the driver has moved the automatic transmission from
park into drive or reverse, NHTSA said.
   The agency excluded from its definition of sudden acceleration
instances of high idle speed or throttle sticking.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Rise On Platinum's Strength</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A resurgence of commercial and speculative buying pushed platinum
futures prices to a 3-month high Tuesday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and boosted gold and silver futures as well.
   On other markets, crude-oil futures tumbled; soybeans retreated;
grains were mixed; cattle futures advanced; and pork futures fell.
   Platinum settled $4.80 to $5.30 higher with the contract for
delivery in April at $551.50 a troy ounce, the highest close since
the market's mid-December collapse from levels near $600.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $5.20 to $5.80
higher with April at $395.70 a troy ounce; silver finished 6.5 cents
to 6.8 cents higher with May at $5.965 a troy ounce.
   Platinum's slow climb back from less than $520 an ounce reflects
both renewed commercial demand from the Far East and the gradual
return of bullish speculators who bailed out of the market following
the Ford Motor Co.'s Dec. 14 announcement that it had developed a
catalytic converter that did not use platinum as a primary
ingredient.
   The use of platinum as a chemical catalyst in the automobile
pollution-control devices accounts for about a third of global
platinum consumption.
   With Ford still testing its new converters, the platinum market's
attention has gradually returned to the existing tight-supply
situation, which is expected to persist into the 1990s.
   Yet platinum traders remain cautious, an attitude underscored by
Tuesday's activity. The April contract traded as high as $559 during
the session, then dropped back as traders lost their nerve and took
profits.
   ``Still, you've got to give the market some credit just for
getting up there,'' said Craig Sloane, a metal-market analyst with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   In contrast, the gold and silver markets closed near their highs,
indicating a greater willingness among traders to gamble that prices
of those metals will continue to rise.
   Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co.
in New York, said gold's performance on Tuesday ``tells me we're in
for a short-term pop to the $400 area,'' a level the gold market has
not seen since late January.
   Tuesday's sharp drop in energy futures prices on the New York
Mercantile Exchange was attributed to technical factors rather than
to a change in the bullish fundamentals that have recently driven
crude-oil futures to prices approaching $19 a barrel.
   Those positive factors include agreements by non-OPEC
oil-producing countries to reduce their crude-oil output in a
concerted effort to boost prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 37 cents
lower with April at $18.30 a barrel; heating oil was .35 cent to .57
cent lower with April at 51.08 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.18 cent to .54 cent lower with April at 51.41 cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures prices fell moderately on the Chicago Board of
Trade, reflecting concerns about the imminent arrival of new
supplies from the record-large Brazilian soybean crop.
   Grain futures finished narrowly mixed as spillover selling from
the soybean complex was offset by bullish forecasts for a week of
relatively dry weather in the Plains and Midwest, analysts said.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents lower to 2} cents higher with March at
$4.34 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 2 cents higher with March
at $2.78\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1{ cents higher with
March at $2.10 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 6\ cents lower
with March at $7.64\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures moved moderately lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in technically inspired selling while pork futures rose on
expectations for lighter marketings and higher cash prices.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent .42 cent lower with April at 77.57
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .35 cent lower with
March at 82 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent to .37 cent
higher with April at 44.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.08 cent to .55 cent higher with March at 39.10 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   First Union Corp. said Tuesday that it
agreed to acquire Florida National Banks of Florida Inc. in a cash
and stock deal valued at $749 million.
   Meanwhile, Chemical Banking Corp. said it would sell its 4.9
percent stake in Florida National and abandon earlier plans to
acquire the Jacksonville, Fla., bank once interstate banking between
New York and Florida is permitted.
   Under the latest deal, First Union would pay $27.12{ per common
share of Florida National, with one half in cash and the other in
preferred stock. First Union also received a warrant under to buy up
to 9.2 million shares of Florida National's unissued common stock at
$22.50 a share.
   Florida National soared $6.37{ a share to $24.25 in national
over-the-counter trading Tuesday. On the New York Stock Exchange,
First Union dipped $1.12{ a share to $21.50 and Chemical rose 50
cents to $31.25 a share.
   First Union said Florida National would operate as a Florida
subsidiary, with $17 billion in assets, making it the second largest
bank in that state with 400 branches.
   Florida National, with assets of $7.8 billion, has 185 offices
and nearly 5,000 employees. Charlotte-based First Union reported
assets of $29 billion at the end of 1988 and operates 702 banking
offices in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and
Tennessee.
   Florida National Chairman John D. Uible will join First Union's
board of directors and become chairman of the executive committee of
the Florida subsidiary. Billy Walker will continue as chairman and
chief executive officer of First Union National Bank of Florida and
Byron Hodnett would continue as president.
   First Union Chairman Edward E. Crutchfield Jr. said the bank
plans to ``gain significant operating efficiencies from the combined
company.''
   ``Because of those anticipated efficiencies, we expect this
merger to have less than two percent impact on earnings per share in
1989 and a slightly positive impact on our earnings per share in
1990,'' he said.
   Chemical and Florida National Banks had agreed to merge in 1984
when interstate banking between New York and Florida became
permissible. But Chemical Chairman Walter V. Shipley said,
``Reciprocal interstate banking between Florida and New York seems
unlikely in the near future.''
   Chemical said it would sell to First Union its warrants in
Florida National for $100 million. In addition, Chemical agreed to
sell to First Union its holdings of 1.3 million shares of common
stock in Florida National under the terms of the First Union merger
agreement.
   Chemical said that if the First Union merger is not consummated,
the merger agreement between Chemical and First National would be
extended by a period equal to the time during which First Union's
merger with Florida National was pending.
   Either Chemical or Florida Union may terminate their agreement in
early 1991 if the merger with First Union does not occur, Chemical
said.

   The stock market posted a small loss Tuesday
after the Dow Jones industrial average made a short-lived run past
the 2,300 level.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips, up 20.53 points on Monday,
slipped 4.11 to 2,290.71.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 708 stocks
rising, 730 falling and 524 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 172.50 million
shares, up from 168.88 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 204.94 million shares.
   The market's advance Monday was prompted in part by a monthly
report from a group of corporate purchasing executives that pointed
to a slowing of economic growth in February.
   That was interpreted as a positive portent for the inflation
outlook and possibly a sign that upward pressure on interest rates

   But analysts said some traders were fearful that they might get
some contradictory evidence later this week when the Labor

   Those worries were cited as a primary force behind a modest rise
in open-market interest rates Tuesday.
   Street estimates call for the report, due out Friday, to show an
increase of about 250,000 in nonfarm payroll employment.
   Time Inc. jumped 9\ to 116}. Analysts cited speculation that the
company, in reaching its weekend agreement to merge with Warner
Communications, might have opened itself up to a takeover bid from
some other direction.
   Warner shares rose | to 48~.
   Some other entertainment issues gained ground for the second
straight session in reaction to the plans for Time and Warner. Gulf
&amp; Western, which reported higher quarterly earnings, climbed 1\ to
47[, and MCA 1\ to 54\.
   Oil-service stocks, which have benefited from recent strength in
oil prices, were broadly higher today. Schlumberger gained } to 38|;

   Microsoft tumbled 8{ to 53{ as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. The company said it expects to report lower
earnings for its fiscal third quarter ending March 31.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $5.03 billion, or 0.17
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

   The dollar rose against most major currencies
except the Japanese yen in U.S. trading Tuesday after moving
generally higher on markets abroad.
   Gold prices posted sharp gains. At 4 p.m. EST, Republic National
Bank of New York quoted a bid of $392.90 for a troy of gold, up from
Monday's late bid of $387.30.
   Victor Polce, a currency trader for Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said
much of the dollar's movement was motivated by technical factors.
   Dealers bought dollars and sold West German marks after the West
German central bank indicated key interest rates will not be changed
in the near future. In recent days, the mark had been driven higher
periodically on speculation that West German interest rates might be
going up.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7220 late Tuesday, cheaper
for buyers than Monday's late $1.7250. Later in New York, sterling
fetched $1.72155, down from $1.72335 on Monday.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.03 Japanese yen, up
from 127.63. In London late Tuesday the dollar traded lower at
128.80 yen. The dollar finished at 128.825 yen in New York, lower
than Monday's late level of 129.15.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late
levels, included: 1.85525 West German marks, up from 1.85275; 1.5845
Swiss francs, down from 1.58575; 1.19825 Canadian dollars, up from
1.19235; 6.303 French francs, up from 6.29725; and, 1,362.625
Italian lire, up from 1,362.125.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late
Monday's rates, included: 1.8520 West German marks, down from
1.8531; 1.5847 Swiss francs, up from 1.5830; 6.3000 French francs,

   Gold bullion prices gained from $4 to more than $5 an ounce.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $393.30 a troy ounce, $5.30 an ounce higher than

<TEXT>
   A tax-avoidance consultant who owns a bank on the
Pacific island of Saipan is under indictment on three counts of tax
evasion and three counts of signing a false corporate income tax
return.
   Jimmie F. Straw of Dalton, Ga., faces up to 24 years in jail and
fines of up to $600,000 if convicted on all counts.
   He was described in a brochure at a recent symposium as having
written more than 200 books, reports and articles on finance,
investment and offshore banking. He publishes the Offshore Banking
News.
   The indictment claims he ``substantially understated'' his income
on individual and corporate tax returns for 1982, 1983 and 1984. He
was indicted Friday.
   On Monday, he denied evading taxes. ``I've got nothing to hide,''
he said.
   He said he had been warned in 1985 that a U.S. Treasury official
had drawn up a ``hit list'' of people involved in banking in Saipan.
He said his records were subpoenaed in 1986.

   Even with its planes idled and thousands of its
employees on furlough because of a strike, Eastern Airlines was
interviewing applicants for jobs as flight attendants Tuesday.
   Union members, picketing outside the hotel where the interviews
were held, said Eastern was trying to line up non-union attendants
to replace United Transport Workers members.
   The company denied it and said it was simply going ahead with the
interviews because of help-wanted ads it placed before the strike.
   Several of the 15 to 20 young men and women who showed up for
interviews said they were not aware that the airline was in
difficulty.
   Similar interviews were held in Miami on Sunday and Monday and
also were picketed by unionized attendants.
   Judy Coughlin, secretary-treasurer of Local 533 of the Transport
Workers Union, which represents the flight attendants, said Eastern
was also interviewing in Boston on Tuesday and was planning
interviews in New York on Wednesday.
   ``We are meeting these people at every hotel,'' Ms. Coughlin
said. ``We have had great success in convincing people to turn away.
We handed them a flier and told them about other airlines that were
hiring flight attendants and would pay them more money, and we said
please come back some day when things are better at Eastern.''
   Flight attendants have joined Eastern's pilots in honoring picket
lines thrown up Saturday by the airline's 8,500-member Machinists
union.
   Eastern announced Monday it was sending more than 5,000 workers
home. And most planes were grounded by the crippled airline, the
nation's seventh largest.
   This didn't deter a young woman who would identify herself only
as Barbara as she emerged from the room where she had filled out a
form and talked with an Eastern representative about future
employment.
   ``I want a job,'' she said. ``I really didnt know about the
controversy that was going on.''
   The airline's ad, which appeared Sunday, said, ``Tired of the
nine to five grind? See more of the world in a month than most
people see in a lifetime. Eastern is currently recruiting flight
attendants and would like to consider you a candidate.''
   The ad said the jobs would pay $1,000 to $1,200 per month in base
salary plus expenses.
   Jeff Bowen, who was conducting the interviews, said they were
``basically informational.''
   Asked in a telephone interview whether the interviewing session
had anything to do with Eastern's current difficulties, Bowen said,
``Yes, it does. I think at present we need to make sure that we can
get this operation back on its feet.''
   ``We are not passing out applications,'' he said. ``We are just
trying to get an idea of those individuals who would be interested
in working for Eastern in the event that we had to do some
replacement of flight attendants.''
   When a reporter arrived at the hotel, however, Bowen said, ``What
we are doing is trying to fill the commitment we made in the
newspaper ads, rather than lock the door. We had no idea we would be
faced with this situation.''
   Bowen said he believed the ads were placed last Wednesday.
   Outside the hotel, Teal Carter, a stewardess with Eastern for
five years and a member of the union, said, ``They're hiring scab
flight attendants to replace us.''
   Ron Richardson, an official of a union that represents workers at
the Washington Hilton where the interviews took place, said he
telephoned William H. Edwards Jr., general manager of the hotel,
Monday night and ``asked him to throw Eastern out of there.''
   ``His response was that they had already rented the place, and
they couldn't legally get out of it,'' said Richardson, who is
executive secretary-treasurer of Local 25 of the Hotel and
Restaurant Employees Union.
   Edwards said of the company, ``It was a situation that they could
have avoided. I don't foresee it happening again.''
   The airline has 7,000 flight attendants.
   David Ashelford, a picket who said he had been with Eastern for
23 years, suggested new attendants would be hired at much lower pay.
He said an experienced flight attendant makes about $1,800 a month
plus $25 an hour for flying time in excess of 75 hours a month.
   Bowen, told that the pickets did not believe his account of the
purpose of the interviews, said, ``They probably wouldn't, as a
result of the climate that we have now at Eastern Airlines. But I
can assure you there has been no plan made as a result of what has
happened.''
   The woman named Barbara said company interviewers did not talk to
her about the union or tell her that people were being laid off. She
also said she was not given encouragement that she would get a job.
   Francis Folefac of Baltimore said he was aware of the strike, but
that Eastern representatives told him ``they were just trying to
honor the ad in the paper.'' He, too, said they did not give him any
encouragement.

<TEXT>
   A divided House panel approved a union-sought
bill Tuesday that would compel President Bush to intervene in the
Eastern Airlines strike, despite administration insistence that such
involvement would not settle the bitter dispute.
   The legislation, passed 21-12 by the House Public Works' aviation
subcommittee, would require Bush to appoint an emergency board to
study the impasse that has grounded most of the carrier's flights
and to recommend a solution. During this process, there would be a
cooling-off period of up to 60 days in which the striking employees
would return to work.
   The bill is not expected to reach the House floor until sometime
next week. Although many lawmakers concede that there are not enough
votes in Congress to override an expected presidential veto,
Democrats say the exercise is worthwhile because of the pressure it
places on Bush to find a solution to the work stoppage.
   ``When we send the bill to President Bush's desk, we're passing a
hot potato back to him,'' Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said after the
panel's vote. ``What's his solution?''
   The legislation would require the emergency board to study the
dispute between not only Eastern and its striking machinists, but
between the airline and two other unions whose contracts have
expired: the Air Line Pilots Association and the Transport Workers
Union of America, which represents flight attendants.
   ``We want to stick it all into the same bag, settle it all at
once,'' said the subcommittee chairman, Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn.
   But Bsh, in a session with White House reporters, repeated his
belief that the ``free collective bargaining'' process should
resolve the standoff. He said it would be ``inappropriate'' for the
government to impose a solution.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner told the panel that he
would recommend that Bush veto the legislation, arguing that the
``frustrations and animosity'' between Eastern's management and its
striking workers was building and would fester despite a board's
appointment.
   ``You can't run an airline where you have the kind of animosity
over a period of time building up,'' Skinner said.
   Democrats, however, argued that a board could produce a solution
to the dispute, which began Saturday and has pitted Eastern against
its 8,500 machinists and ramp workers represented by the
International Association of Machinists. Most of the carrier's
pilots and flight attendants have also walked off their jobs in
support of the machinists, in a dispute focusing on wages and
benefits.
   ``The emergency board gives cover to both parties to reach
agreement,'' said subcommittee chairman James L. Oberstar, D-Minn.
   Elsewhere, House Speaker Jim Wright also sought to pressure Bush
to appoint a board, telling reporters that presidential leadership
was needed.
   ``He can do as previous presidents have done, as President
Kennedy did in the steel crisis,'' Wright said. ``That's
leadership.''
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland sounded a similar theme to the
House subcommittee, blaming Bush's failure to appoint a board for
the strike.
   ``It is time for Congress to fill the leadership void the
president has created,'' Kirkland told the lawmakers.
   Skinner told the subcommittee that administration remains poised
to introduce legislation that would prohibit secondary boycotts of
railroads and other airlines that labor has threatened to support
the Eastern strikers.
   ``A strike at Eastern alone does not substantially disrupt this
nation's transportation system,'' Skinner said. ``It is only the
specter of secondary activity that threatens to hold hostage this
nation's economy and our global competitive position.''
   In his session with reporters, Bush reiterated that secondary
boycotts ``are not in the public interest and I will send
legislation to Congress to forbid them, if that is necessary.''
   Skinner drew occasionally testy questions from the panel's
Democrats, who kept demanding to know why the administration has so
far adopted a passive role in the dispute.
   ``There hasn't been any rolling up of sleeves and getting in
there,'' said Rep. Douglas Bosco, D-Calif.
   ``I'm not afraid to go anywhere, anyplace, and put anybody in a
room'' to find a settlement to the strike, Skinner responded.
   Even some Republicans were critical of Eastern's owner, Frank
Lorenzo, and said they had not decided whether they would support
the Democrats' call for an emergency board.
   But other GOP lawmakers supported Bush's stance. Rep. John Paul
Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, ranking Republican on the House Public
Works Committee, said, ``To convene an emergency board and return to
the wages and working conditions of last week will only further
bleed Eastern and endanger its survival.''
   Democrats said they expected the administration to have little
chance of getting its bill through the Democratic-controlled
Congress.
   All 19 Democrats on the subcommittee who voted supported the
legislation. All but two of the panel's Republicans opposed the
measure: Reps. Sherwood Boehlert and Guy Molinari, both from New
York.
   On a related issue, Boehlert introduced a bill Tuesday that would
require air carriers to submit plans to protect their ticketholders
in case of bankruptcy.
   Boehlert said ``tens of thousands'' of travelers have already
purchased tickets for Eastern flights, some of which might not be
redeemed if the airline reorganizes under the bankruptcy laws.

   The nation's largest automaker said it was offering Oldsmobile
buyers the options of low-interest financing, cash back or free
gasoline for a year with the purchase of some cars.
   The program lasts through March.
   Some Buick buyers will have the option of cash rebates or low

will have that same option through May 2.
   By Tuesday afternoon, Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. had
announced no new incentives.
   Earlier in the day, though, Ford Vice Chairman Harold Poling said
his company would remain competitive with other automakers'
marketing programs.

<HEAD>Lone Star Seeks to Restructure Steel Unit's Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Texas Steel Facilities, a subsidiary of Lone
Star Technologies, is negotiating with lenders to stretch out
payments on $135 million in bank debt, the parent company said.
   The steel unit, formerly known as Lone Star Steel Co., faces a
$44 million payment on the debt March 31. The holding company is not
responsible for East Texas' debt.
   East Texas Steel Facilities met Friday with a group of its bank
lenders, led by NCNB Texas National Bank, to discuss restructuring
the debt, officials said Monday.
   In addition, Lone Star said auditor Arthur Andersen &amp; Co. may
include an ``explanatory paragraph'' in its report on the company's
financial results for the year. The paragraph, described as slightly
less severe than a qualified report, would reflect uncertainties
about Lone Star's ability to complete the proposed debt
restructuring, the company told the Dallas Times Herald.
   Buoyed by overly optimistic projections of demand for its
oilfield products, East Texas Steel borrowed heavily last year to
purchase high-quality slab steel used to manufacture pipe. Bank debt
in the year soared to $144.1 million from $108.3 million.
   But the steep downturn in world oil prices dried up the market
for oilfield products, and Lone Star in 1988 posted a $24.8 million
loss. Despite two profitable quarters early in the year, East Texas
steel operations contributed more than half of the loss.
   As a result of the latest downturn, the company in August laid
off 300 workers at its steel mill in Lone Star, which in its heyday
employed more than 6,000. In January, the company eliminated 150
additional jobs as part of its reorganization of its steel
operations.
   Lone Star said it has tried without success to find other sources
of financing. To raise cash, the company said, it sought possible
joint-venture partners or buyers for selected assets.

<DATELINE>CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Cinema Corp. earnings jumped
63 percent in its first quarter compared with the same quarter of
1988, spurred by a $55.7 million gain from the sale of its stock in
RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Net earnings were $44.4 milion, or 60 cents a share, compared
with $28 million, or 38 cents a share, in the same period last year,
the company said Tuesday.
   General Cinema said revenues from its beverage bottling division
and ticket sales at its movie theaters increased, but operating
profits declined due to higher soft drink promotional spending and
higher operating costs for new and larger theaters.
   Revenues for the three months ended Jan. 31 totaled $607.5
million, up 9.8 percent from the first quarter of 1988, but
operating earnings fell to $40 million from $46 a year earlier, the
company said.
   During the first quarter, Genera Cinema agreed to sell its soft
drink bottling business to Pepsico Inc. for $1.75 billion in cash,
but the transaction is subject to approval under antitrust laws by
the Federal Trade Commission. Richard Smith, General Cinema's
chairman and chief executive officer, said the deal was expected to
close by late March or early April.
   The soft drink bottling business contibuted $167.8 million in
revenue and $12.2 million in operating earnings to first-quarter
results, the company said.

   A federal judge Tuesday refused to order Eastern
Airlines pilots back to work, even though Eastern warned it couldn't
otherwise survive the 4-day-old Machinists strike. A spin-off job
action by pilots nationwide failed to clog airports as feared.
   Eastern earlier sent 2,500 more non-union workers home, blaming
pilots for leaving it with ``no business on the books.''
   ``If the pilots do not come back to work, Eastern Airlines is
gone,'' company attorney David Ross said. He warned during a court
hearing that Eastern was faced with bankruptcy without its 3,600
pilots, who have firmly refused to cross picket lines the Machinists
union set up Saturday.
   U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis denied Eastern's request for
a temporary restraining order less than a half hour after the
three-hour hearing.
   Pilots union spokesman J.B. Stokes called the ruling ``a victory
of principle; a victory of ethics.''
   Later, the pilots union reported that Eastern management called
its negotiators to try to set up new talks. No details were
immediately available.
   ``Basically, we're extremely cautious,'' Stokes said, adding that
no talks had yet been scheduled.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the company would appeal
Davis' ruling immediately to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Atlanta.
   Ross said the company couldn't operate more than 48 to 72 hours
more without the pilots, and could have to file for federal
bankruptcy protection.
   Matell said bankruptcy would be ``a course of last resort.'' He
declined to speculate on how long it would be before Eastern would
make such a move.
   Eastern, the nation's seventh-largest airline, already has nearly
shut down, saying it was forced to lay off a total of 9,500 workers
this week because of the pilots' adherence to the strike in a
17-month-old contract dispute.
   The airline wants $150 million in concessions; the Machinists
want $50 million in raises. Eastern has said it lost more than $1
billion this decade and $1 million a day before the strike.
   The national pilots union had asked its 40,000 members at all
airlines to follow rule books stringently starting Tuesday, and
there were fears of havoc as delays piggy-backed around the country.
But while the union said 60 percent of its members followed the
directive, delays were few.
   ``The reports we have are that there has been no effect on
operations,'' said Capt. Roger Hall, spokesman for the Air Line
Pilots Association. He said the job action would continue, but he
did not know for how long.
   The union contended its action was not a slowdown but an effort
to ensure safety during the strike. Transportation Secretary Samuel
K. Skinner at a news conference in New York called the effects
``sporadic.''
   The Federal Aviation Administration said in Washington that ``the
system so far has operated in a close to normal manner.'' Spokesman
Bob Buckhorn said there had been sporadic requests for
more-than-usual handling by air traffic controllers ``but the system
has been able to accommodate those requests.''
   President Bush in Washington said pilots should not ``make the
innocent traveling public a pawn,'' and stood by his opposition to
government intervention to stop the walkout by the 8,500-member
Machinists union, which represents mechanics and ramp service
workers.
   Skinner appealed to Congress not to force the administration to
impose a 60-day cooling-off period. But a House subcommittee
approved a union-sought bill Tuesday that would compel Bush to
intervene by appointing an emergency board to study the impasse
between the airline and union and recommend a solution. It would
include a cooling-off period of up to 60 days in which the striking
employees would return to work.
   The bill is not expected to reach the House floor until sometime
next week, and many lawmakers concede there are not enough votes in
Congress to override an expected presidential veto.
   Bush said if the Machinists try to shut down rail service later
this week he will ask Congress to ban such secondary boycotts. He
said the strike should be settled through bargaining, but no talks
are scheduled.
   Secondary boycotts, particularly in the New York metropolitan
area, could disrupt commutes for hundreds of thousands of people.
   Unions representing workers at three suburban New York rail lines
Tuesday appealed a judge's order issued over the weekend barring
them from honoring any Machinists picket lines set up at railways.
An appeals court hearing was set Wednesday, but the lower-court
judge extended his order, originally set to expire Wednesday
afternoon, through Friday.
   Meanwhile, Eastern has just 1,500 employees still working, down
from 31,200 before the strike, according to Joe Leonard, Eastern
executive vice president and chief operating officer, who announced
another 2,500 layoffs Tuesday.
   ``We simply don't have any business on the books today,'' Leonard
said. ``Our competitors have simply been sucking up the traffic, our
traffic, since March 4.''
   Some union members have speculated that Eastern's owner, Texas
Air Corp., and its chairman, Frank Lorenzo, are trying to tear the
carrier apart. Lorenzo's anti-union reputation has galvanized
Eastern's unionized employees.
   ``One of the problems in this situation and the reason it's gone
on for 17 months is Mr. Lorenzo's credibility with his unions is
about as low as you can get,'' Skinner said. ``He thought the pilots
would cross. It's pretty clear to me the pilots had no intention of
crossing the picket lines.''
   Nearly 3,000 Eastern employees jammed Miami's Knight Center
downtown Tuesday night for a teleconference being carried by
satellite television to 11 other groups across the country.
   ``Lorenzo makes Machiavelli look like Gomer Pyle,'' Henry Duffy,
president of the Air Line Pilots Association, told the cheering
union members.
   Eastern has contended the pilots, who along with its 5,900 flight
attendants have honored the picket lines, are conducting an illegal
strike. But pilots attorney James Linsey said the pilots can honor
the strike under the Railway Labor Act.
   Flights were slightly delayed at some airports Tuesday by ALPA's
action, which was to take advantage of the discretion pilots have in
deciding preflight and prelanding checks, such as reading flight
plans to controllers.
   ``Everything's quiet,'' said Mildred Schneider, spokeswoman for
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the
three major New York-area airports.
   ``If there a slowdown here, we can't see it,'' said John Braden,
spokesman at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, where Eastern
had accounted for 26 percent of the traffic before the strike.
   Airports in Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Kansas City,
Mo., Phoenix, and Portland, Ore., reported few or no delays. San
Francisco officials said fog delayed some flights.
   In Denver, officials at Stapleton International Airport said the
pilots' action delayed some United flights, while Continental
Airlines flights by non-union pilots flew on schedule.
   ``It certainly isn't by accident,'' commented Richard Boulware, a
spokesman for the airport.
   Eastern has said it would continue only its most profitable
routes _ the shuttle between Washington, New York and Boston, and
three round trips weekly between Miami, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and
Santiago, Chile.
   Before the strike, Eastern carried 100,000 passengers on 1,040
flights daily. On Tuesday, the shuttle was ``running at full
throttle,'' with all 62 flights, but not with full loads.

   Dealers said the index rose after investors regained confidence
in the market after a favorable showing in Tuesday's session.
   Stability in the foreign exchange market also contributed to the
Nikkei's rise Wednesday, said Yukio Nakajima of Nomura Securities in
Tokyo.
   He added, however,``There are still some uncertainties over how
the stock scandal will affect the government.''
   The Nikkei index declined upon the start of trading Tuesday
following the arrest of a leading executive on charges of bribery in
a major stock-profiteering scandal with links to leading politicians.
   On Wednesday, Takashi Kato, former vice labor minister, was
arrested on bribery charges in the same stock scandal but morning
trading closed before reports of the arrest surfaced.
   In currency dealings, the dollar slumped from the previous day
mainly due to selling for profit-taking, traders said.
   Market participants were reluctant to make major moves before
Friday's release of U.S. employment figures for February, said one
trader.

   Strike-crippled Eastern Airlines shut down nearly all operations
and idled at least 5,000 workers Monday, saying it could not afford
to maintain the 60-year-old business while pilots honored a
3-day-old Machinists walkout.
   ``We can cannot run an airline with unpredictability,'' Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell said in Miami. ``We cannot continue to
inconvenience passengers. We cannot afford the steady financial
drain.''
   Matell said Eastern would continue to run only its most
profitable routes _ its Northeast shuttle service between
Washington, New York and Boston and three round trips weekly between
Miami, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile.
   The dramatic action in the 17-month labor dispute came after
Eastern asked a federal judge in Miami to order the financially
ailing carrier's 3,600 pilots to stop honoring the Machinists'
walkout and return to work.
   ``The pilots are conducting their own economic strike against the
company,'' Matell said. ``We believe that it is an illegal weapon to
gain (the Air Line Pilots Association's) economic objectives.''
   He said 5,000 to 6,000 idled non-union employees were notified
immediately of their ``no-work'' status and would receive lump-sum
payments ranging from $270 to $640, depending upon their normal
wages.
   With more than 17,000 workers on strike, honoring picket lines or
laid off, Eastern has about 7,000 active employees, Matell said.
   ``I just can't believe that they got away with this,'' said a
weeping Diana Goss, 24, a ticket agent at Miami International
Airport.
   She was one of a group of non-union employees going into a
hastily called evening meeting with Eastern managers at the
terminal. The laid-off employees were told to report back at 9 a.m.
Tuesday to turn in their identification badges.
   Matell said Eastern would file for bankruptcy only as a last
resort but indicated the pilots' walkout may force the airline to
consider the option.
   ``We're not the ones who sought the strike,'' said Eastern pilots
union head John J. Bavis. ``This is a strike that Mr. Lorenzo
called,'' he said, referring to parent Texas Air Corp. Chairman
Frank Lorenzo, whose anti-union reputation has galvanized Eastern's
union employees.
   The injunction request filed in Miami before U.S. District Judge
Edward B. Davis came as pilots nationwide planned a sympathy
job-action starting Tuesday morning that threatened to delay every
flight on every airline.
   Eastern canceled almost all flights Monday but had supervisors
haul baggage and de-ice planes to keep its top-priority Northeast
shuttle flying some scheduled trips between New York, Boston and
Washington despite a snowstorm.
   As of 8 p.m. EST Monday, 69 flights had taken off, 25 of them on
the Northeast shuttle, the airline said. Four or five more shuttle
flights were expected by the end of the day. Before the strike,
Eastern averaged 1,040 flights carrying 100,000 people daily.
   Eastern pilots are honoring a strike by 8,500 mechanics and ramp
service workers that began Saturday. The strike has grounded most
flights, stranded thousands of passengers and pushed the nation's
seventh-largest airline to the brink of collapse.
   ``You can't fly without pilots,'' Matell said, adding that
Eastern's future was under ``hour-to-hour evaluation.''
   Before the strike, Eastern claimed losses of more than $1 billion
in the last decade, $1 million a day and said it had $2.5 billion in
debts stemming from its acquisition by Texas Air in February 1986.
   A top credit-rating agency said Eastern's roughly $400 million in
cash will drain fast because the airline must pay competitors to fly
waylaid passengers and is facing a $70 million debt repayment within
weeks.
   ``The strike poses a serious threat to Eastern's survival, and
management may choose to cease operations or seek bankruptcy
protection if more pilots don't return to work soon,'' Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. said.
   Matell said about 200 pilots out of 3,600 were flying, but the
pilots union put the number at 88. Eastern had 85 flights Saturday
and 93 Sunday, the company said, including three shuttle flights
with 14 or fewer passengers. Eastern averaged 1,040 flights daily
before the strike.
   The pilots union advised members Monday to ignore an order and
personal plea from Eastern President Phil Bakes to return to work,
alleging ``threats and intimidation'' by management.
   The company said the pilots would be classified as strikers if
they did not return to work by noon Tuesday. Eastern implied they
could risk their seniority, pensions and jobs.
   Eastern asked the federal judge for a preliminary injunction
against the pilots union, ordering them back to work and requesting
damages. A Tuesday afternoon hearing was scheduled.
   ``I think it's time to face this for what it is _ a pilots
strike,'' Eastern spokesman James Ashlock said. ``We waited to see
whether this was an initial demonstration and whether they would
come on back, but now it's time.''
   Eastern said under the 1926 Railway Labor Act the pilots must
continue negotiating a new contract and may not strike. The law says
unions may strike only after federal mediation, which the Machinists
underwent before striking.
   ``We knew that was coming,'' said ALPA Secretary-Treasurer Rick
Chapman, adding that association attorneys would study the motion.
   Eastern's 5,900 flight attendants also have honored the strike by
mechanics, baggage handlers and ground crew. Eastern is seeking $150
million in concessions while the Machinists are demanding $50
million in pay raises.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland urged Eastern's flight attendants
and pilots to continue honoring Machinist picket lines.
   ``Those three unions have stood shoulder to shoulder in an
admirable display of solidarity,'' Kirkland said at a news
conference in Washington. ``All of us stand ready to give you the
support you need to see this mission completed.''
   Federal Aviation Administration Associate Director Anthony
Broderick said inspectors are monitoring Eastern closely and there
had been no safety lapses.
   He said the FAA is prepared to respond to the planned pilots
action but didn't elaborate.
   The national pilots union planned a teleconference for all
members to explain the action set to begin at 6 a.m. Tuesday. Pilots
would strictly follow aviation safety rules, which could
dramatically slow air traffic.
   ``It's an individual thing, obviously,'' said Jim Gray, a Delta
Airlines pilots' union spokesman. ``The captain of the plane decides
what he wants to do. But we are encouraging our pilots to observe
the fly-safe.''
   The international Machinists union planned to appeal a federal
judge's order barring sympathy strikes on three New York-area
railroads that threatened to disrupt the morning commute for more
than 300,000 people. No strike-related transit problems were
reported in any cities.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson on Monday also temporarily
barred unionized Amtrak workers from honoring any picket lines by
Eastern Machinists.
   In Washington, a White House spokesman said President Bush won't
push for a bill banning secondary picketing unless the strike
against Eastern spreads.
   The chairman of a House subcommittee scheduled a hearing for
Tuesday and said he hoped for quick action on legislation to force
Bush to appoint an emergency board and halt the strike for 60 days.
Bush had refused to intervene.
   The sharp cuts in operations have affected thousands of Eastern's
100,000 daily passengers. Eastern said many stranded Caribbean
vacationers were back on the U.S. mainland Monday.
   A morning snowfall in New York and other problems forced
cancellation of 10 of the first 16 Eastern flights on the Northeast
shuttle. Pan American World Airways was doubling service on the same
routes.
   Eastern officials in New York said employees were asked to wear
warm clothing and boots and supervisors handled baggage, de-iced
planes on the runway and worked as flight attendants to keep the
shuttle flying.
   In Atlanta, the Rev. Jesse Jackson donned an Eastern pilot's cap
and led chanting strikers in a prayer session at Continental
Airlines ticket counter. Lorenzo broke a 1983 strike at Continental
by filing for bankruptcy.
   ``If Lorenzo can't fly it, let the workers buy it,'' Jackson said.
