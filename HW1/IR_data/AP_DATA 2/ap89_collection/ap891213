<HEAD>Mississippi River Found To Be Polluted And Deadly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tons of pollution poured into the Mississippi
River each year threaten to push up already-high death rates all
along the river, said the authors of a report released Wednesday by
the environmental group Greenpeace.
   ``We're seeing an obvious pattern,'' said Joe Thornton, who
wrote the report with Pat Costner.
   ``The overall conclusion is that mortality rates in counties
along the river are higher than in the rest of the nation and tend
also to be higher than the rest of counties in Mississippi River
states,'' Thornton said.
   The conclusions were drawn from a two-year review of data from
state and federal environmental agencies, as well as from
laboratory analyses conducted during a voyage down the Mississippi
by the Greenpeace ship Beluga in 1988.
   Pollution was found from St. Paul, Minn., to the mouth of the
river. It was found in increasing amounts as the expedition
continued downstream, the report said.
   The most severely elevated death rates occur downstream from
areas of the greatest toxic discharges, including St. Louis,
Memphis and all riverside parishes in Louisiana, the report said.
   The report noted that some downstream communities, including New
Orleans, draw drinking water from the river.
   Average mortality rates in lower Mississippi River counties and
parishes, from Cairo Ill., to the Gulf of Mexico, are 14 percent
higher than the rest of the nation, researchers said.
   The river carries 213 million pounds of toxic chemicals per year
as it passes New Orleans, the report said. Beginning at the river's
mouth, the Gulf of Mexico contains a 2.4 million acre dead zone
which cannot support aquatic life.
   The report blamed pollution for decreasing fish and wildlife
populations all along the river.
   River pollution comes from chemical manufacture, the use and
manufacture of pesticides, pulp and paper mills, sewage treatment
plants and hazardous waste disposal facilities, Thornton said.
   ``It's not a pretty report and the picture that it paints is not
a pretty picture,'' said Costner. ``What we're seeing is evidence
that it's time to change.''
   Greenpeace warned that without immediate action to reduce
pollution in the river, as well as along its banks and in the air,
the entire river region can expect more cancer and other problems.
   The Louisiana Chemical Association also released a report
Tuesday showing that between 1987 and 1988, its member industries
had reduced by 9.1 percent, or 89 million pounds, the chemical
wastes they are required to report to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. Its members disposed of 924 million pounds of
chemical wastes in 1988, the report said.
   LCA spokesman Richard Kleiner said the report does not include
all wastes, only those required to be reported under federal
Superfund regulations. He said the amount of wastes not reported
under those regulations could not be determined.
   Chemical industry officials dispute the correlation between
cancer rates and chemical releases, saying the statistics used by
Greenpeace have not been adjusted for other factors, such as
poverty, race, urban locations and smoking and drinking.

<HEAD>Magistrate Drops Weapons Charge Against Miss West Virginia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   MORGANTOWN, W.Va. _ A magistrate on Wednesday dropped a weapons
charge against Miss West Virginia Lisa Bittinger, citing a lack of
evidence.
   Marion County Magistrate C. Frank Jones said the 21-year-old
beauty queen had a right to defend herself with a small-caliber
handgun during her late night tussle with Tammy Boyce, 23.
   ``Now had she taken the gun out and held it on this woman or
initiated the problem, that's different,'' Jones said. ``But if
someone has you by the hair, and you just momentarily bring it into
view to scare them off, that's not brandishing.''
   Boyce had alleged that Bittinger pulled a gun on her during a
Nov. 7 scuffle on a city street after a traffic accident.
   Bittinger, in turn, filed a complaint accusing Boyce of reckless
driving, battery and destruction of property.
   Jones found Boyce guilty of all three counts and sentenced her
to two terms of 120 days in the Marion County Jail, respectively,
on the battery and property charges and 90 days on the driving
offense. The sentences are to run concurrently.
   Boyce was freed on a $2,000 property bond that will allow her to
remain free until Dec. 27.
   ``I wanted togive her time to enjoy her holiday,'' Jones said.
``This whole thing was really just a cat fight.''
   Bittinger said she wants to put the incident behind her.
   ``This wasn't the first threat I've had from her and it's not
the first threat I've had from other people,'' she said. ``I am
afraid, but life happens you just have to deal with it.''
   Bittinger, whose reign ends in June, said she plans to continue
carrying a handgun for protection.

<HEAD>U.S. Justice Department Approves Revised Charter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says it has no objection
to the changes to the City Charter that were approved by voters
last month.
   News of the approval came in a letter to Frederick A.O. Schwarz
Jr., chairman of the Charter Revision Commission, from Acting
Assistant Attorney General James P. Turner of the department's
civil rights division.
   ``Our work is now done,'' Schwarz said. ``The foundation has
been laid for a more representative, fairer and efficient city
government.''
   Schwarz, a former city corporation counsel, noted that Turner's
letter ``calls particular attention to the fact that `minority
voters will likely have an increased opportunity to elect members
of the enlarged and more powerful City Council.'''
   ``Increasing minority representation in the city government was
one of the Charter Revision Commission's major goals,'' he said.
   Although Turner wrote that the department ``interposes no
objection'' to the revised charter, he added that federal law
allows the option of going to court in the future ``to enjoin the
enforcement of these changes.''
   The revised charter abolishes the Board of Estimate and
transfers its fiscal and planning powers to the mayor, the City
Council and other city officials. It also increases the size of the
council from 35 to 51 members.
   The Board of Estimate had been declared unconstitutional because
it gave equal representation to each borough despite wide
disparities in population.
   City Council Majority Leader Peter Vallone, who has long pushed
for abolition of the Board of Estimate and a more equitable balance
of power between the city's executive and legislative branches,
also praised the department's decision.

   The drought of 1988 hit hardest in the upper
Midwest _ perhaps nowhere harder than in North Dakota. More
disaster relief aid went there than to any other state. The third
story in a four-part series, ``Cashing In on the Drought,''
examines how the $3.9 billion disaster aid program helped farmers
most in need.

   Carl Grindberg survived the drought with
a $45,000 dose of federal aid. But for this farmer and others, it
was a give-and-take bailout: Take the money with one hand, give it
away with the other.
   ``The guy who sold me $5,000 of fuel, he got paid,'' Grindberg
said. ``The business that sold me fertilizer and spray and
chemicals and tires, they got paid. What I'm saying is, the farmer
got the money directly, but indirectly a lot of others benefited.''
   The 1988 drought relief program poured more than $400 million
into North Dakota, the nation's most agriculturally dependent
state. The money not only helped rescue thousands of farmers; many
say it also kept the state afloat.
   ``It's what carried us through in 1988,'' said Cass County
extension agent Duane Hauck. ``If it hadn't been for drought aid,
the economic situation all through North Dakota would have been
disastrous. It was the major source of income for most farmers.''
   ``I don't think too many farmers took disaster aid and bought
Cadillacs and went on vacation in my area,'' Grindberg added.
   A study of the $3.9 billion disaster relief program, conducted
by The Associated Press over seven months, found that outside the
Midwest drought area, lax rules and requirements led to thousands
of farmers collecting millions of dollars for nothing more serious
than the normal trials of nature.
   But money did reach areas Congress most intended to aid,
including North Dakota, where it kept some farmers on their land
and may have prevented some business closures.
   ``You might say it kept the state alive,'' said Fred Selberg,
another farmer in this Red River Valley county. ``Everyone in North
Dakota in some way or another was helped.''
   North Dakota, where the drought evoked memories of Dust Bowl
days with tumbleweed dancing along the barren horizon, received the
most disaster dollars. More than 49,000 producers shared $410.2
million _ about 10.5 percent of the total package. Almost all was
for crop loss.
   The state, the No. 1 producer of hard-red spring wheat, lost
two-thirds of its 1988 crop; millions of normally golden acres
withered to pathetic rows of shriveled brown stumps. But drought
aid cut farmers' losses from $1.1 billion to $706 million, a North
Dakota State University study found.
   Disaster payments reduced statewide losses to businesses, banks
and households from $3.4 billion to $2.1 billion, the study said.
Each farm dollar triples as it travels down Main Street into the
economy.
   Another university survey of 466 farmers said that without
drought aid, the average farmer's net cash income would have been
just $6,300. Drought payments added $15,000.
   Disaster aid and crop insurance also were critical to other
drought-ravaged states, including Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and
Wisconsin. The five states together received nearly half the
assistance allocated nationwide.
   Disaster aid and crop insurance pumped about $500 million into
Iowa's economy, an Iowa State University study said.
   ``There was no question it was needed to stave off a major new
wave of bankruptcies and financial problems among Corn Belt
producers,'' said Mark Edelman, a university economist.
   ``Even the drought assistance for most farmers fell well short
of bringing what their income would be with normal yields, but it
provided a safety net,'' he said.
   It was the same in North Dakota, which has struggled with an
exodus of young, educated people, declining revenues, fading small
towns and the loss of nearly a fifth of its farms this decade.
   ``From '81 through '86, the bottom pretty much fell out of
everything,'' said Greg Schulz, who farms about five miles from
Grindberg. Good crops the next two years started to reverse the
trend, but drought stalled the recovery.
   ``It has a demoralizing effect when you have a disaster,'' said
Dwight Aakre, a North Dakota State economist. ``Financial aid helps
to alleviate that. The last thing North Dakota needed is more
negatives to push us down.''
   Despite relief and nearly $200 million in crop insurance, the
state still needs ``a good year to get back on our feet,'' Hauck
said. ``We didn't get that in '89,'' he added, referring to
continuing drought in North Dakota's west and south-central
sections.
   In fact, while crops statewide are in better shape than 12
months ago, dollar losses will exceed 1988's estimated $530
million, Aakre said. Two reasons why: more acres of wheat were
planted this year, and farmers don't have grain reserves to sell at
high prices as they did in 1988 to ease their burden.
   Cass County also had a better 1989 crop but expects higher
losses in crop dollars. And while virtually all farmers here
received government aid in 1988, far fewer will be eligible a
second time.
   About $19.8 million in 1988 aid was divvied up among 1,847 farms
in Cass County, the state's leader in crop acres. Wheat, corn,
barley, soybeans, sugar beets and navy and pinto beans are grown
here. Last year, production was 60 percent to 70 percent below
normal.
   For Larry Richard, a 36-year-old father of three who farms 1,000
acres near the town of Horace, $39,000 in aid, even coupled with
$55,000 in crop insurance, amounted to ``just enough to break even.
We were able to cover all our bills. That's all I had really hoped
for.''
   If that seems like a lot, Richard, who grows wheat, soybeans and
barley, notes it costs him $150,000 for rent, interest, seed,
fertilizer, equipment and other necessities.
   ``You throw a lot of expenses way ahead of what your crop is
going to be,'' he said. ``Our investment in farming is tremendous
compared to the average businessman. At least they have a commodity
to sell. We might not.''
   Schulz, who farms 6,000 acres, said that without his $100,000
maximum payment he might have been forced to sell equipment or lay
off help.
   Along with crop insurance and the sale of grain reserves, he
said, ``I was able to mark time in '88. ... Last year we had a
break-even type of year. This year it was break-even. Next year,
we're going to have to start coming around to a profit.''
   Grindberg, who farms 900 acres of wheat, soybeans and barley,
was in the red last year despite $70,000 in aid and insurance. His
1989 crop was better but still below normal; he expects to get only
$3,000 in relief payments.
   Grindberg, a 40-year farming veteran who also delivers mail
part-time, thinks the government last year ``pushed he panic button
on this disaster thing and went too far. In '89, they went too far
the other way I think.''
   ``Disaster aid is political,'' he said. ``Depending on when you
have the disaster depends on whether they sweeten the pot or not.
If it's an election year ... they all get on the bandwagon.''
   But Grindberg will persist.
   ``As long as the banker says go on,'' he said, ``next year's
always the best year.''

   Not all who collected aid from the 1988 drought program were
Midwestern farmers faced with ruin. Cotton farmers in New Mexico,
lettuce growers in New Jersey, a Texas company that raised
potatoes, all collected federal dollars _ completely legally _ even
though, by their own admission, they could have weathered last
year's drought.
   Here are some stories of aid that spilled beyond the boundaries
of the 1988 drought:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Last year wasn't so bad for Conowingo, Md., dairyman Robert
Dempsey. Good rains in July rescued his feed corn from six weeks of
no rain, and milk prices were up.
   But when he heard about the disaster program, he went over his
records with county officials. Two hours of paperwork and he was
told he qualified for $1,200.
   ``Six hundred dollars an hour,'' Dempsey said with a grin as he
milked his 140 Guernseys in his long, open barn. ``That's not bad
pay. About the same as a lawyer.''
   Dempsey makes no apologies about taking the money. ``It was
there and I took advantage of it,'' he said. But he doesn't favor a
repeat of the program.
   ``It would make people say, I can put crops in the ground and if
it doesn't grow, I'll collect,'' he said.

   Chester Lathem and his family are what you might call
diversified farmers. They run a real estate company; grow wheat,
corn and milo; raise cattle; and own three oil wells that Exxon
operates on their Texas Panhandle land.
   To participate in federal price support programs for their main
crops of wheat, corn and milo, they have to set aside some acres.
In 1988, they planted potatoes on 125 of those acres _ and saw hail
wipe out the crop. Other crops did well.
   But the Lathem family was far from being knocked out of farming
by hail on potatoes planted on excess acres.
   Their farm, formally named the Lico Partnership, received
$134,087 under the drought program, legally exceeding the $100,000
single-farmer aid limit because the partnership is owned by four
family members.
   The potatoes were insured and were expected to gross $223,600
for Lico, according to Lico's file at the Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service. Insurance plus the disaster
aid brought $214,153 _ without the expense of harvest, which Lathem
said would have been two-thirds the cost of raising the potatoes.
   Still, he said he only broke even on the potato acreage.
   ``You bet it was necessary,'' Lathem said. ``We wouldn't have
lost the farm over it, but we probably would have had to do some
things differently. It would have been much tougher to go back and
plant crops for the new year. I think it was a good program.''

   The 1987 growing year, plagued by heavy rain and high winds, was
horrible for Ted White, a Chaves County, N.M., cotton grower, but
no disaster payment program existed to help him then.
   White got luckier in 1988, because of the record-setting drought
in the Midwest. Although he had a better crop in 1988, he was able
to collect disaster aid.
   ``I had a cold, cold, cold rain and then that wind that comes
down like on a runway and just cuts the cotton,'' said White. About
half his cotton was wiped out last year, although his irrigated
fields still yielded a healthy 355 pounds per acre and he made
about two-thirds of his normal gross, based on government payment
rates.
   Insurance paid $8,959, and drought aid approved by the local
ASCS office paid $18,285 _ even though the disaster law included
neither cold weather nor high winds.

   Last year was not the luckiest for Carl Race Jr., who grows
apples and corn in Blairstown, N.J. A well that fed a special
trickle irrigation system for some of his orchards dried up. A pump
that watered his corn failed at the height of the dry weather.
   Yet Race weathered the drought well; good production on other
acres eased his losses. So he went to the county office with some
trepidation to inquire about the 1988 drought relief program.
   He learned he was entitled to a payment, but he felt
uncomfortable with government programs.
   ``It's kind of a personal pride thing. You think you're asking
for welfare,'' he said. ``I was thinking some low interest loans of
4.5 percent, that would be great.''
   Instead, he got cash, nearly $12,000.
   ``I sat and wondered, `What am I going to do with $12,000?''' he
said. ``I decided the best way to spend the money was to buy an
irrigation pump.''
   He spent $13,000 for a pump. Then came 1989 and its endless
rains. ``It's been sitting out there, rusting ever since,'' Race,
laughing, said of his new pump.

   Noel Hicks grows winter wheat in the harsh, arrid, wind-swept
Oklahoma Panhandle, the heart of what was once the Dust Bowl. In
early 1988, the weather was dry in Guymon, Okla., although nothing
really out of the ordinary.
   Winds he estimated at 80-90 mph damaged 147.5 acres of irrigated
wheat in February 1988. By harvest time, nothing was worth cutting,
so he just plowed it up, he said. He didn't have insurance.
   Months later, unexpected help arrived in the form of the drought
relief bill _ a program that hadn't even been considered when the
winds took his wheat.
   He collected $11,499.
   ``If the wheat had been good, we would have made twice that
much,'' Hicks said. ``I'd rather have a big wheat crop than take a
check from the government anytime.''

<HEAD>Maryland County Sells Own Brand of Discount Liquor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER BRANDLON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When high school senior Susan Bergeron
learned that Montgomery County was selling its own brand of liquor,
the local official of Students Against Drunk Driving was furious.
   ``How can a county, with its innumerable drug task forces and
anti-drug campaigns, run liquor stores and, even worse, bottle its
own brand of liquor?'' the 17-year-old wrote recently in a letter
to the editor of a local newspaper.
   The question has grown old for county officials, who had hoped
the furor over its County Crest brand would have died away by now,
nearly two months after the discount brand of gin, vodka, rum,
bourbon and Scotch went on sale in county-run liquor stores.
   Introduction of the house brand liquor brought out a flurry of
news coverage and critical letters to the editors of newspapers.
But county officials say they only received three critical letters
and the issue has quieted.
   ``Let's put this in perspective, for God's sake. A private label
doesn't make anyone drink,'' said county liquor control director
Jerome Baylin. ``All we're saying is if you choose to drink in
Montgomery County, please shop here.''
   Montgomery County buys directly from producers, wholesaling beer
and wine to retailers but handling sales of liquor through its own
stores. County officials maintain County Crest is no different from
house labels of other large liquor retailers.
   The house liquor is made by a Baltimore distillery, which
bottles it in two sizes under the County Crest label.
   A 1.75-liter jug of County Crest ranges in price from $10.95 for
vodka to $15.99 for Scotch _ $2 or $3 less than comparable brands,
but more than the cheapest products.
   The affluent county outside Washington, D.C., whose voters opted
to control alcohol sales at the end of Prohibition, is the first
local government in the nation to retail its own liquor, said
Baylin, who is president of the National Alcoholic Beverages
Control Association.
   According to the association, which represents governments that
directly control the sale and distribution of liquor, 19 states
purchase liquor and either sell to retailers or directly to the
public, in addition to Maryland, where only Montgomery County does
so.
   County Executive Sidney Kramer said the sale of County Crest was
in keeping with the county's goal of controlling liquor sales, as
well as a source of extra revenue. Some of the revenue raised by
the liquor control office pays for substance abuse programs, he
added.
   According to Baylin, the liquor control office has netted $62
million above expenses in the past five years.
   He said it is too soon to know how much money the sale of house
brand liquor will raise, but the products appear to be ``doing
exceptionally well, thanks to the press.''
   Bergeron said she was angered by the introduction of County
Crest at a time when Montgomery County officials have been pressing
SADD to abandon its policy of neither condoning nor condemning
teen-age drinking in favor of a ``zero tolerance'' stance.
   ``Basically, they are saying SADD is sending mixed messages when
they themselves are doing that,'' said Bergeron, who is treasurer
of the county's SADD chapter. ``I'm not going to listen to someone
who's a hypocrite.''
   The county government says controlling alcohol sales is better
than permitting liquor stores on every corner. Neighboring Prince
George's County, which does not have liquor control, has more than
140 liquor stores, compared with the 23 government outlets in
Montgomery, Baylin said.
   Virginia Bright, head of the Montgomery chapter of Mothers
Against Drunk Driving, said there is nothing wrong with liquor
control but thinks the county should not both regulate and
participate in the liquor industry.
   ``We have enough brands to choose from without the county making
its own,'' she said.

   The leftist guerrilla
movement's decision to launch escalated attacks in the cities has
brought relative calm to the countryside, for 10 years the civil
war's principal theater.
   Both the guerrillas and the army have concentrated most of their
fighters in or around San Salvador and several provincial capitals
since the rebels began their urban offensive Nov. 11.
   Areas controlled by the insurgents and government forces have
not changed significantly, but the urban concentration appears to
favor the rebels, whose organizational base always has been the
forsaken hamlets and byways of this small Central American nation.
   Although fewer guerrillas are operating in the countryside, they
appear to be able to move more openly and with less pressure from
government forces.
   In Usulutan Province, in the heavily fought-over eastern third
of the country, the government forces that were observed generally
were restricted to two paved highways and strategic population
centers. During one day's travel in one region alone, no government
troops were seen at all.
   Guerrillas, however, walked openly along trails and
oxcart-rutted tracks through fields of corn, sorghum, soybeans and
sesame.
   In San Francisco Javier, a town of about 5,000 people, residents
said rebels were coming and going almost daily, buying supplies,
talking with townspeople and trying to recruit new fighters.
   ``They gather the young guys and ask them to accompany them to a
meeting outside town,'' said the owner of a small business. ``After
a couple hours they come back, except maybe one or two who decide
to join.''
   He, like others, said the rebels did not point their guns at the
prospective recruits or otherwise coerce them. Even so, one of the
few young men around said he hid every time the guerrillas came to
town and almost no civilian males between 14 and 25 years old
walked the streets.
   The rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani has
accused the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front of
``kidnapping'' hundreds of young men in recent weeks, allegedly to
replace losses suffered in the offensive.
   A five-man rebel squad encountered just south of San Francisco
included two boys barely taller than their M-16 assault rifles.
One, who appeared to be about 13, flashed a smile and V-for-victory
sign. He said he had been a guerrilla for three months.
   The army has not completely abandoned the countryside. At the
isolated hamlet of El Palmo, north of San Francisco Javier in the
west-central part of the province, a 30-man search-and-destroy unit
of an elite infantry battalion engaged and routed a guerrilla
contingent.
   The soldiers of the Atonal battalion proceeded to burn or throw
down a ravine large quantities of beans, salt, tortillas, fresh
meat and clothing left behind by rebels. The guerrilla camp had
also served as a factory for homemade catapults used as artillery,
about a dozen of which were found and destroyed.
   In the southeastern part of the province near the Pacific coast,
government forces were limited to a contingent of 6th army brigade
troops in Jucuaran and a detachment of Marines on El Espino beach.
   Peasant farmers of the region know where the rebels are camped.
After an hour of coffee sipping and conversation, a young woman
excused herself and left a tile-roofed adobe house near Jucuaran.
She returned a few minutes later to say she would take reporters to
the rebel base several miles away.
   ``The offensive is irreversible,'' said ``Carlos,'' the
khaki-clad, AK-47-toting regional commander in an interview beneath
a tree beside a cow pasture. ``The war has entered a definitive
phase, and nothing except deeper crisis and more instability can be
expected.''
   Some of the most destructive fighting of the urban offensive has
been in working-class neighborhoods. Carlos acknowledged that
taking the war to the cities may have alienated many of the same
poor people the FMLN claims to champion.
   ``People in San Salvador never really felt the war like people
in the countryside. Their routine of home-to-work-to-home, the
desire for stability came to cloud their vision and limit their
ambition to being able to put up a new curtain in the kitchen,'' he
said.
   ``We know war does not bring well-being. It's not that we see
war as the solution in itself. It is a means, and it is the only
option they have left us,'' he said.

   Huge crowds opposing a Communist
government chanted, ``Demisi,'' meaning, resign. But some shifted
the chant slightly to ``Devizy.'' That means foreign exchange.
   To Czechoslovaks, freedom to travel is an empty privilege
without currency to spend abroad. Beyond their borders their
banknotes in crowns are hardly worth anything.
   Once a year, Czechoslovaks are allowed to line up for days to
buy a maximum of $23 at twice the official rate. Or they can buy
any amount on the black market at nearly five times the rate.
   That is one crushing problem Czechoslovakia faces in trying to
retool a centrally planned socialist bloc economy into a prosperous
system open to the world. There are a lot more.
   ``Basically, everything that was wrong before is still wrong,''
observed a Western economic analyst who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. ``And things are getting worse.''
   Dusan Triska, a senior economist in Czechoslovakia's Academy of
Sciences, agreed, adding a litany of crises that reformers will
have to address.
   Western banks are lined up to lend money, and investors are
milling in the wings. In Eastern Europe, however, any economic
solution hinges on social and political priorities.
   ``Above all,'' Triska said, ``we have to avoid mistakes made by
Poland and Hungary. Before we open to the exterior, we have to open
up inside. We can't use foreign resources until we can use our
own.''
   Until the war, Czechoslovakia had Europe's sixth strongest
economy, with heavy industry and some of the world's most advanced
technology.
   During 40 years of Communism, plants were operated with little
investment and shoddy maintenance. The once-strong infrastructure
now needs billions of dollars worth of capital.
   The system operates at a loss, with no relation between costs
and prices. Milk sells for half what it costs to produce. Bread is
so cheap farmers use it for fodder.
   Since the 1968 Soviet-led invasion, Communist leaders have tried
to offer 15 million Czechoslovaks the softest life in Eastern
Europe in exchange for political submissiveness.
   There is a car for every 4.9 people. An average worker can buy
one with 15 months' pay. Most Eastern Europeans wait years for
delivery.
   Everyone has a job, and goldbricking is seldom grounds for
dismissal. Workers are encouraged to spend weekends at vacation
homes.
   Shops offer Italian kiwis and French cheeses. If veal is scarce,
the lamb is excellent. Vacations are cheap for travelers who like
Bulgaria.
   The system is rich ground for larceny, from petty to grand.
Waiters sell caviar from the refrigerator. Doctors take tips for
preferred service. Factory managers wheel and deal.
   Pressure was contained when lives were lived behind an Iron
Curtain. Now that people want to travel and buy Western goods, the
closed economy generates growing frustration.
   The hard part is that it must get worse before it gets better.
Any new government will need a firm mandate.
   ``Someone will have to tell Czechoslovaks they have to work
harder and earn less,'' Triska said. ``The Communist Party can't do
that.''
   Most likely, a Western diplomat noted, a coalition government
will emerge. ``Coalitions are not famous for taking tough
measures,'' he said.
   Economists agree that reform means massive layoffs and reduced
control will send prices soaring. Subsidies have to be eliminated.
And incompetent managers must be replaced.
   ``We will have to abolish many inefficient factories and
gradually open to the international market,'' said economist
Miroslav Slouf, a deputy mayor of Prague. ``Any new elected
government will be unpopular within months.''
   Speaking privately, Czechoslovak specialists wonder if any
political leaders will be able to break up the forbidding mass of
state monopolies for industries and services.
   One reformer, who asked not to be named, put it: ``These mafias
of managers are too organized, too well protected. They don't want
change. There are so many ways to resist.''
   The economy was shaped within the Soviet bloc when central
planners prepared to parallel _ and outdo _ the West. The systems,
though outmoded and largely discredited, remain intact.
   Czechoslovakia's largest employer is an uncompetitive steel
industry. It makes its own version of three-quarters of the world's
range of engineering items.
   Unlike Poland and Hungary, Czechoslovakia borrowed little and
kept up reserves. As other economies failed, it supplied their
staples. With a touch of national pride, leaders subjected
Socialist brothers to customs barriers.
   Czechoslovak economists agree they must avoid borrowing until
loans can be put to use expanding earnings. Meantime, the economy
needs ``devizy,'' hard currency.
   Tourism is a potential source. Prague is among Europe's most
beautiful cities. The countryside, in forests and mountains, is
often dramatic. Other service industries are virgin ground for
joint ventures.
   ``A lot is possible,'' Slouf said. ``But you only have to look
at the experience of our neighbors. It will not be simple.''

<HEAD>Extreme Rightist Politician Faces Criminal Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Right-wing extremist Jean-Marie Le Pen could face
criminal prosecution for remarks linking a French Cabinet
minister's name to Nazi death camps.
   Court action is possible because the European Parliament, by a
vote of 178-91 on Monday, lifted his immunity.
   The French Justice Ministry had asked the Parliament to remove
the immunity of the leader of the National Front so he could be
taken to court on charges of slandering a government minister.
   Le Pen, at a rally on Sept. 2, 1988, spoke of Public Service
Minister Michel Durafour as ``Durafour-crematoire.'' Crematoire can
be used to refer to the crematories where the Nazis burned the
bodies of their death-camp victims.
   As a member of the European Parliament, based in Strasbourg,
France, Le Pen has immunity from prosecution unless the legislature
votes to remove it.
   Conviction of slandering a Cabinet minister is punishable by a
jail sentence of up to three months and a maximum fine of $13,000.

   Less than a month after marching
on Wenceslas Square demanding free elections, Lubor Spilchal is
overseeing contributions and poster campaigns for the opposition.
   The pro-democracy movement, which swiftly overturned 41 years of
Communist Party domination, now is frantically organizing for the
elections it had long demanded.
   Spilchal is an activist with Civic Forum, the main opposition
coalition, which is trying to gear up for elections without knowing
exactly how they will take shape or when they will occur.
   On Tuesday, it was unclear how a new president would be
selected. Under the constitution Parliament has until Dec. 23 to
elect a president to succeed Communist hard-liner Gustav Husak, who
resigned Sunday.
   But some legislators want a referendum, with the people making
the choice.
   There is also the question of when free parliamentary elections
will be held. They are expected some time next year.
   The uncertainty, as political developments roar like a tidal
wave across Czechoslovakia, has left everybody scrambling. Anything
seemed possible.
   Civic Forum has opened an office at an art gallery near Prague's
old quarter and young volunteers are having trouble coping with the
demand for information and requests to join.
   ``We don't have any idea how many people have signed up, it's
something like 20,000 a day,'' said Jana Blazkova, handing a
registration form to a suburban housewife. ``We're so busy we
haven't had time to count.''
   The office is open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., ``but people are
still coming long after we are closed,'' said Spilchal. ``We're
having an invasion from the country, people coming from far away.
Nearly everyone makes a contribution.''
   By midday Tuesday, Spilchal had received more than 10,000 crowns
($1,000), which was to be divided between a student strike fund,
the Civic Forum and Vaclav Havel's campaign for president.
   Civic Forum spokesman Lubos Dobrovsky said that in one month the
Civic Forum office has collected the equivalent of more than
$38,000, and that should cover expenses for about a month.
   Some money has been spent for thousands of posters supporting
Havel, a playwright often jailed during Communist rule and now the
main opposition candidate for president.
   The Svoboda print shop kept its presses rolling day and night
Monday and Tuesday producing Havel posters. Crowds gathers as the
posters were pasted up and some people tore them down to take home.
   A young girl from a town near Prague said she was ``taking a few
to put up where I live. When they are gone I will come and get some
more. It's hard to imagine free elections.''

<TEXT>
   A woman convicted of passing bad checks
pleaded for a lenient sentence by inviting the court to look at her
sterling record as a scholar and a teacher. The judge did _ and
found out she was also a liar.
   Jeanne Brooks was sentenced Monday to the maximum 15 years in
prison on two bad check charges and one count of grand theft. The
sentence was imposed after her last-ditch plea for leniency in
which she noted that the state earlier had offered 18 months.
   The 32-year-old defendant claimed to have a bachelor's degree in
English literature from Holy Cross, a master's degree from
Georgetown University and six years' teaching at a St. Petersburg
high school.
   A presentence investigation portrayed what she had hoped _ a
picture of a person who just made a mistake.
   But Hillsborough Circuit Judge Susan Bucklew noticed an
inconsistency in the report _ while Ms. Brooks was earning her
master's in Washington, D.C., she was serving jail time in New
York. The judge ordered further investigation.
   Ms. Brooks, sobbing before the bench Monday, admitted they were
all lies, although she said she had been a teacher's aide.
   ``I lied to the court. I've lied to everybody in my life for a
long time now,'' Ms. Brooks said. ``I tried to validate what
everybody expected of me. There's no excuse, no justification.''
   ``I would seriously doubt almost anything you tell me now,'' the
judge said.

   Leona Helmsley was sentenced Tuesday to four
years in prison and fined $7.1 million by a federal judge who
ignored her sobbing plea for mercy and blamed the hotel queen's tax
evasion on ``naked greed.''
   U.S. District Judge John M. Walker Jr. also sentenced Mrs.
Helmsley, 69, to three years of probation and 750 hours of
community service at Hale House, a home for infants born addicted
to drugs.
   Mrs. Helmsley _ said to have boasted to a maid, ``We don't pay
taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.'' _ was also ordered to
repay nearly $1.7 million in back taxes and bear the government's
costs in bringing her to justice.
   ``Your conduct was a product of naked greed. ... You believed
you were above the law and displayed no remorse or contrition,''
Walker told Mrs. Helmsley.
   He said she shirked a ``moral responsibility to uphold the law''
that came with her position, breaking the law ``consciously and
repeatedly.''
   ``No person,'' he said, ``no matter how wealthy and prominent,
stands above the law.''
   Walker allowed Mrs. Helmsley to remain free pending a decision
on her appeal of her Aug. 30 conviction on 33 counts of tax
evasion. Should her appeals fail and she goes to prison, she would
be eligible for parole after serving a year and three months.
   Mrs. Helmsley could have been sentenced to 127 years in prison
if she had been given the maximum sentence for each of her
convictions and been ordered to serve them consecutively, which is
rare.
   Mrs. Helmsley, wearing a black dress with a gold pendant, told
Walker before sentencing, ``I am more humiliated and ashamed than
anybody can ever imagine that I've been found guilty of a serious
crime. ...
   ``I feel like I'm in the middle of a nightmare,'' she said, her
80-year-old husband, Harry, sitting three rows away.
   ``I beg you, don't let me lose Harry too,'' Mrs. Helmsley said,
sobbing, her cheeks flushed and stained with tears. ``Our whole
life has been work and each other. Please don't. We have nothing
else.''
   But she was stone-faced as she left the courthouse with her
husband.
   ``Four years in jail, you should have got more,'' shouted
someone in a crowd of bystanders that stood by as she left.
   The sentiment was shared by many in the crowd who saw Mrs
Helmsley as the embodiment of a greedy decade in which inside
traders and savings and loan executives grabbed lucre and headlines.
   Since her indictment, Mrs. Helmsley has been vilified in court
and out. She was a high-profile target; her picture appears in
nearly every ad for the Helmsleys' 27 hotels. The ad for
Manhattan's Helmsley Palace describes it as ``the only palace in
the world where the queen stands guard.''
   Mrs. Helmsley's attorney described her as a ``tough bitch'' in
opening arguments. The prosecutor, in his closing, described her
``selfishness, greed and sheer arrogance.''
   Mrs. Helmsley and her husband were worth a billion dollars. But
she was convicted of evading more than $1.2 million in federal
taxes between 1983 and 1985 by billing personal expenses through
the Helmsley business.
   Those expenses included construction of an elaborate, $1.1
million enclosure for the swimming pool at the Helmsley's 28-room
mansion in Greenwich, Conn., along with a $130,000 indoor-outdoor
sound system Mrs. Helmsley fancied after seeing a similar system at
Disney World.
   There were other expenses: $58 for leg waxing, $21 for a
membership in a crossword club, several purchases of lingerie and
underwear.
   Employees who testified at her trial described her as a
capricious, despotic boss who fired people on a whim. When she
balked at paying a contractor who built an outdoor barbecue pit at
the estate, an employee reminded her that the man had six children.
   He should have kept his pants on, she replied.
   These revelations led New York Mayor Edward I. Koch to describe
her as ``the wicked witch'' and developer Donald Trump to call her
a ``sick woman.''
   Mrs. Helmsley told the judge that coverage of the trial had
forced her and her husband to hide from the public in their house.
   Her attorney, Gerald Feffer, told Walker his client had become a
``lightning rod'' for hate mail, death threats and anti-Semitic
remarks. ``She has been ridiculed, abused and humiliated in an
unprecedented way, having nothing to do with her wrongdoing.''
   He asked that her sentence be limited to community service at
Hale House. Prosecutors asked for up to 15 years of prison time.
   Two employees were tried and convicted along with Mrs. Helmsley.
Co-defendant Joseph Licari received 30 months in prison, three
years probation and a $75,000 fine. Co-defendant Frank Turco,
another Helmsley employee, received a two-year term, three years
probation and a $50,000 fine.
   Her husband originally was charged, but his case was dropped
when it was found his mental capacity had diminished. During the
two-hour proceeding Tuesday, Helmsley dozed; when his wife was
sentenced, he watched alertly.
   To suggestions that Harry Helmsley would be left alone if Mrs.
Helmsley was sent to prison, prosecutor James DeVita replied:
   ``At the very least, Mr. Helmsley knowingly acquiesced to Mrs.
Helmsley's insistence that these dealings be carried out. He more
than anyone else had the opportunity to see these crimes were not
committed and he didn't do it.''
   The Helmsleys still face prosecution on charges of evading state
taxes; no trial date has been set.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Criticize `Degradable' Plastic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The label ``degradable'' is surfacing on
plastic products from trash bags to diapers, but environmentalists
call it a marketing ploy that should be rejected.
   Six environmental groups called Tuesday for a boycott of all
degradable plastic products, contending there is no proof that the
products will decompose in a landfill any faster than conventional
plastics.
   ``Degradable plastics are a consumer ripoff,'' said Jeanne Wirka
of the Environmental Action Foundation, a Washington-based
environmental group.
   Richard Denison of the Environmental Defense Fund accused
manufacturers of ``preying on the environmental concerns of
American consumers'' to sell trash bags and other plastic items.
   ``Degradable plastics may be good for profits, but they are bad
for the environment,'' Denison said.
   In recent months, an increasing number of degradable products _
from trash and grocery bags to diapers _ have cropped up on grocery
shelves. Manufacturers contend the products made of a plastic
compound will degrade in a relatively short time when left to
sunlight and, in some cases, even in landfills.
   The products include Hefty and Glad trash bags and several
brands of diapers. Some supermarkets also are increasingly using
degradable plastic bags for carrying groceries home because
environmentally concerned consumers shy away from conventional
plastic bags.
   Biodegradable plastics are made by adding corn starch to the
plastic polymer.
   Archer Daniels Midland Co., which manufactures the corn starch
additive, maintains that its use will cause the plastic to degrade
in a landfill ``within three to five years.''
   ``The life of current landfills can be extended by 20 percent
while achieving an operational cost savings of 30 percent,''
company vice president Martin Andreas said recently when describing
the degradable plastic product.
   ``They will not solve all our solid waste issues, but they have
definite advantages if applied properly,'' said Tim Draeger,
executive director of the Degradable Plastics Council, a St.
Louis-based group made up largely of companies involved in the
production or use of degradable plastics.
   The plastics industry is divided on the issue.
   ``Degradability is not the solution to the solid waste
problem,'' said Robert J. Barrett, general manager of solid waste
management solutions at Mobil Chemical Co. in Pittsford, N.Y.
   Mobil, which produces Hefty bags, turned to degradable bags
because of consumer and competitive pressures, he said.
   ``We have found ourselves in the position of a strong consumer
demand for degradable plastics'' and competitors are providing the
product, Barrett said in a telephone interview.
   He said the plastic in Hefty bags will decompose faster than
conventional plastic when exposed to sunlight, but responds no
different from other plastic when buried.
   The plastic compound used by Mobil is different from the corn
starch and plastic polymer mixture that makes up the degradable
plastic products advertised as decomposing when buried.
   Barrett said Mobil had no definitive proof that the corn starch
mixture will decompose significantly faster in a landfill
environment than conventional plastic.
   The groups calling for the boycott are the Environmental Defense
Fund, Environmental Action Foundation, Environmental Policy
Institute-Friends of the Earth, Natural Resources Defense Council,
Public Citizen and the Coalition for Recyclable Waste.

<HEAD>Democrats, Republicans Signal Fray Over Defense Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats and Republicans are clashing over
the adequacy of defense cuts being weighed by the Bush
administration, even as former Pentagon officials support larger
reductions.
   A Senate Budget Committee hearing, held Tuesday to consider the
depth of savings that might be found in the defense budget, offered
a preview of the partisan clashes likely to dominate debate over
the fiscal 1991 budget.
   While committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., argued that
military spending can be reduced well below current levels, ranking
Republican Pete Domenici of New Mexico insisted that cutbacks must
be deliberate and well studied.
   Sasser said that as a result of the military buildup of the
Reagan administration, this year's $285 billion Pentagon budget is
$70 billion above the U.S. peacetime average since World War II,
excluding the Korean and Vietnam war years.
   ``Those massive expenditures have ... diverted us from the
enterprise of building a sounder, more productive domestic
economy,'' he said.
   Domenici, however, warned that a reduction of the defense budget
will have to occur slowly and will not necessarily be an economic
panacea.
   ``Will it solve the problems relating to health care costs?'' he
asked. ``Will it make our children study harder in school? Will it
make Americans more productive?''
   Former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara and another one-time
top Pentagon official called for military cuts surpassing those the
Bush administration is considering.
   McNamara and Lawrence J. Korb sought to justify their separate
proposals by citing a need to address domestic problems and react
to the easing of East-West tensions.
   ``In the face of ... economic and social problems, it would be
folly to spend more than we need for defense,'' McNamara, who
served as defense secretary under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson,
told the committee. ``We are doing so.''
   McNamara called for holding military spending to $290 billion in
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, and cutting it gradually to $265
billion in 1994.
   Korb, assistant defense secretary for manpower and reserve
policy from 1981 to 1985, said pressures created by the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's arms reduction proposals make the time right for cuts
in U.S. defense outlays.
   ``There is no doubt that the combination of
Gramm-Rudman-Gorbachev can and should drive the level of defense
spending down by about 25 percent'' over the next five years, Korb
told the lawmakers. Under his proposal, the defense budget would
drop to $225 billion by 1995.
   The Bush administration is studying cutting the projected rate
of growth for Pentagon spending by up to $180 billion over 1992 to
1994, reductions that would still leave military outlays above $290
billion for each of those years.

<HEAD>Bogus Health Plans May Leave Workers Without Benefits</HEAD>

   Thousands of workers risk being stuck with
paying their own medical bills because of bogus insurance plans
that the federal government allows but doesn't police, authorities
say.
   The Labor Department's efforts to monitor so-called multiple
employer welfare arrangements ``are sorely lacking or are
non-existent,'' Patricia Donovan Petersen, deputy insurance
commissioner in Washington state, told a House subcommittee on
legislation and national security on Tuesday.
   The arrangements, which pool health care coverage for small
employers who can't get coverage from larger insurance carriers,
were created under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security
Act.
   States generally regulate insurance and require cash reserves to
back claims, witnesses told the Government Operations Committee's
subcommittee. The health insurance arrangements generally do not
maintain reserves to pay claims, said Raymond Maria, acting
inspector general for the Labor Department.
   Ms. Petersen acknowledged that the reserve requirements would
hurt many beneficial operators.
   ``With the expectation of staying afloat for a period of time
through aggressive selling and slow claims payment, these
fraudulent (arrangements) have become a variation of the classic
Ponzi scheme,'' Maria said. Many operators abscond with the funds,
leaving the workers high and dry, the two witnesses said.
   Some 5 million such arrangements exist nationwide, Maria said.
The number of fraudulent ones is unknown.
   State enforcement agencies have been frustrated ``by multi-state
fraud schemes, limited resources and historical unresponsiveness''
by the Labor Department.
   Both Maria and Ms. Petersen said the operators try to escape
state enforcement by claiming that the federal government has
jurisdiction.
   But Ms. Petersen said her efforts to bring in the federal
government bore no fruit.
   She said she was shuttled between the Office of Inspector
General and the Office of Pension, Welfare Benefit Administration
until she finally gave up and used what state court action she
could in an investigation begun in 1988. She said she couldn't even
get a list of operators.
   ``You are not required to obtain a license or certificate of
authority to operate from the Department of Labor,'' she said.
   She said she was investigating two operators. One ran programs
known as the Western Business Association, Western Timber
Association and Western Alliance of Agriculture; and one ran a
program known as the Northwest Loggers Association.
   By the time she obtained a state court order, the operator of
Northwest Loggers had left the state with the program funds and
``hundreds of consumers in some six states with thousands _
probably hundreds of thousands _ of dollars of unpaid medical
claims and with no medical coverage.''
   ``To date I know of no criminal, civil or other disciplinary
action taken or planned by any division of the Labor Department or
any other entity,'' she said, adding that the operator, Gary N.
Stone, has settled in Nevada and is setting up another plan.
   Unpaid medical claims for the other companies total at least
$100,000.

<HEAD>Next Federal Budget Based on Optimistic Assumptions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will base its next
budget on an optimistic economic forecast showing moderate growth,
lower inflation and unemployment holding steady, administration
sources say.
   The sources, who spoke on condition that their names not be
used, said the administration is expected to forecast that the
economy, as measured by the gross national product, will expand by
2.6 percent next year.
   That GNP figure, based on growth from the fourth quarter of this
year through the fourth quarter of 1990, is significantly higher
than the outlook of most private economists, many of whom are
looking for weak growth of around 1.9 percent next year.
   The administration sources said the GNP forecast has not
received final approval from President Bush, but they said the
number is unlikely to change significantly.
   The administration's economic outlook, which will be formally
released on Jan. 22 along with its 1991 budget proposal, is
prepared based on information supplied by economists at the Council
of Economic Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget and the
Treasury Department.
   The administration's last formal review of the economy, released
in July, also projected economic growth of 2.6 percent for 1990.
   The sources said the predictions made in July on inflation and
unemployment would be very close to the figures used in the next
budget.
   In its July review, the administration forecast that inflation,
as measured by the Consumer Price Index, would rise 4.1 percent in
1990 following a 5 percent increase this year. Through October,
consumer prices were rising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent.
   The administration's July forecast predicted unemployment will
average 5.4 percent in 1990. That prediction is also viewed as
optimistic by many private ecoomists given the fact that the
unemployment rate has already risen to 5.4 percent with higher
joblessness expected in the months ahead as the current dramatic
slowdown in growth spreads through the economy.
   While stressing that the final decision on the forecast has not
been made, Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, said, ``It is safe to say that because the economy has
performed fairly closely to what we were forecasting back (in July)
... that unless something radical changes, it is unlikely that the
macroeconomic assumptions would change very much.''
   Through the first three quarters of this year, the economy
expanded at an annual rate of 2.9 percent. But many analysts
believe growth in the current quarter and the first three months of
1990 could dip perilously close to a recession.
   Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which surveys 51 economists every
month, is predicting the economy will grow by 1.9 percent for all
of 1990, far below the administration's 2.6 percent estimate.
   While the difference is small in percentage terms, every 1
percentage point of lower growth translates into $25 billion in
lost revenue for the government, making it more difficult for the
administration to meet its goal of reducing the deficit without
raising taxes.
   For the current fiscal year, the deficit reduction target in the
Gramm-Rudman law is $100 billion. For the 1991 fiscal year, which
begins next Oct. 1, the deficit target is $64 billion. The actual
deficit in the 1989 fiscal year was $152.1 billion.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., said he
believed weak economic growth will push the current deficit as high
as $140 billion, pushing the 1991 target of $64 billion even
further out of reach.

   Bush administration officials say they doubt a
new peace agreement signed by five Central American presidents will
contribute to negotiated settlements to the conflicts in El
Salvador and Nicaragua.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday the
administration ``remains to be convinced'' that Nicaragua's leftist
government will live up to its renewed promises to carry out
democratic reforms.
   ``We're certainly skeptical,'' Fitzwater said, speaking hours
after the five presidents ended marathon discussions in Costa Rica.
   He said alleged Sandinista-sponsored violence at opposition
campaign rallies has raised questions about the government's
commitment to free and fair elections in February and its
willingness to allow the safe return of Contra rebels from their
Honduran base camps.
   Fitzwater said the fact that Nicaragua agreed not to support the
Marxist rebels in El Salvador was ``encouraging.''
   He added that the administration also was pleased to see the
invitation for the Contras to register to vote if they do so before
a Feb. 5 deadline.
   At the State Department, deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
responded positively to the summit communique's comments on El
Salvador, noting that it expressed support for the country's
embattled government and called on leftist rebels to cease
hostilities immediately.
   But two officials, speaking privately, said they doubted that
the communique would have a significant impact on the thinking of
the FMLN rebels.
   Sen. Chris Dodd, chairman of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee
of the Foreign Relations Committee, said there is diminishing
congressional support for Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani
based on the perception that he is unable to control the Salvadoran
military.
   ``If there were a vote today on aid to El Salvador, at the least
aid would be cut off,'' Dodd said. There is a widespread impression
in the administration and on Capitol Hill that the Salvadoran
military was responsible for the massacre of six Jesuit priests a
month ago.
   The communique calls for the demobilization of both the Contras
and the FMLN. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega had asked for a
Dec. 31 deadline for the dismantling of the Contras but his Central
American colleagues rejected the request, U.S. officials said.
   A member of the House Democratic leadership, Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., demanded that the administration ``end all direct aid to
the Contras _ all aid, of any type.''
   ``The administration can no longer live with the fiction that it
is supporting the peace process while bypassing the Central
American presidents,'' said Bonior, who supported the $49 million
humanitarian aid package when it came to a vote last April.
   When the presidents last met in Tela, Honduras, four months ago,
a Dec. 5 deadline was set for dismantling the Contras but that
target came and went with the rebels still intact. Most are
deployed at camps in Honduras near the border with Nicaragua.
   On the issue of alleged Nicaraguan efforts to support the
Salvadoran insurgency, Boucher noted the communique asks that the
United Nations accelerate the deployment of observers whose mandate
it is to verify that countries do not interfere in the internal
affairs of their neighbors.
   Other officials said the first U.N. units, known by the initials
ONUCA, have arrived in the region and that the operation should be
at full strength after Christmas.
   Meanwhile, three House members complained they were forced to
cancel a planned trip to Nicaragua to inspect election preparations
when they were told at the last minute it would take an additional
10 days to process their visas.
   One of the trio, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said other members of
Congress seeking to visit Nicaragua before the elections planned
for February 25 also are experiencing difficulty in obtaining visas.
   DeLay and Reps. Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, and Frank Wolf, R-Va.,
attributed the delay to a desire by Nicaragua to prevent them from
observing alleged attacks by Sandinista supporters on political
opponents.

<HEAD>Comedy is King in Nielsen Ratings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comedy is still king in the Nielsen's weekly
ratings book as sitcoms held the top six spots.
   NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' was first again, and ABC's ``Roseanne''
moved up to third place behind NBC's ``Cheers,'' according to the
A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for last week's prime-time shows.
   Cosby's ratings, as well as his assurance he wants to do another
season at NBC, is good news for the first-place network. Despite
published reports that CBS had sought his show, Cosby said he
wanted to stay with NBC.
   CBS had negotiated with producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner
for their services as programming chiefs and purchase of their
company, which produces ``Cosby'' and ABC's ``Roseanne.''
   NBC won the week survey by more than 2 ratings points. NBC had
an average of 14.2 to ABC's 11.9 and CBS' 11.3. Each point is the
percentage of the nation's 92.1 million homes with televisions
tuned to a show.
   For the season, NBC leads with a 15.0 average to ABC's 13.3 and
CBS' 12.2.
   Once again, NBC placed its entire Thursday night schedule, plus
two comedies from Saturday, in the top 10.
   Here are last week's top shows: NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and
``Cheers''; ABC's ``Roseanne''; NBC's ``A Different World,'' ``Dear
John,'' and ``The Golden Girls''; CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder,
She Wrote''; NBC's ``L.A. Law'' and ``Empty Nest.''
   NBC's plans to move ``Dear John'' from Thursday to Wednesday in
early January could be bad news for the show starring Judd Hirsch.
NBC will replace it on Thursday with a new show, ``Grand,'' from
the Carsey-Werner Co.
   NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff said at a
televised briefing for affiliate stations Monday that he felt
``Dear John'' was strong enough to survive the move and would be
compatible with ``Night Court.'' He defended giving the coveted
Thursday spot to ``Grand,'' saying the show needed nurturing and
that Carsey-Werner had done well.
   Three CBS Monday night comedies improved their ratings.
``Designing Women'' moved up to 18th place. ``Newhart'' was 21st
and ``Murphy Brown'' was tied for 26th.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s top-rated show is ``Married...With
Children'' in 47th place. However, the Fox shows are down in the
ratings since their late summer surge when Fox ran original shows
against network reruns.
   ABC was first in the evening news ratings with 11.2 to CBS' 10.2
and NBC's 9.9.

<HEAD>1989 Cotton Crop to be Smaller Than Previous Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says the 1989
cotton crop is expected to be slightly less than 12.1 million
bales, down 22 percent from last year's harvest but virtually the
same as estimated in November.
   In its new estimate Tuesday, based on field conditions as of
Dec. 1, the department's National Agricultural Statistics Service
said a 20 percent drop in the acreage for harvest and slightly
lower yields account for the decline from 1988 levels.
   Overall, cotton farmers had 9.53 million acres for harvest this
fall, down 20 percent from 1988. The yield is expected to average
608 pounds per acre, down 11 pounds from last year but up a pound
from the November forecast.
   ``The Delta states experienced favorable weather during harvest
and show an increase from last month,'' the report said. ``In
Texas, an October freeze lowered expected yields.''
   But cotton harvest made good progress last month in the Plains
and could be completed ahead of normal, the report said. By Dec. 3,
the harvest was 89 percent completed in Texas, compared with 75
percent a year earlier and the average of 60 percent.
   Orange production was forecast at 194 million boxes, unchanged
from the previous forecast two months ago based on Oct. 1
indications, but 6 percent below last season.
   ``This decline is due mostly to Florida's 11 percent decrease
from last season,'' the report said. ``Freezing weather in Florida
during late February killed some of the open bloom and damaged new
growth.''
   The report also indicated dry edible bean production this year
at 24.1 million hundredweight, up 25 percent from last year's
drought-reduced harvest but still 7 percent short of 1987
production. Acreage for harvest was up 24 percent from last year
and the average yield, at 1,436 pounds per acre, was up 1 percent.
   Burley tobacco production was estimated at 543 million pounds,
up 14 percent from 1988 but fractionally below the November
forecast. The area for harvest is up 13 percent from last year and
the average yield is up 18 pounds per acre.
   No new estimates were issued for the major field crops such as
corn, wheat and soybeans.
   In a related report, the department's world outlook board said
prospective levels of cotton production and use in 1989 remain at
near the levels indicated last month, although production prospects
are up on a few foreign countries.
   ``This likely will mean reduced needs for U.S. cotton in world
markets and lower U.S. export prospects,'' the report said.
   The global outlook for wheat is ``largely unchanged'' from the
November forecast, the report said. For corn, sorghum, oats and
other so-called coarse grains, 1989-90 production and inventories a
year from now are expected to be down marginally from last month's
outlook.
   ``Larger output is forecast for Canada, Eastern Europe and
Australia,'' the report said. ``However, these gains are more than
offset by smaller crops in the Sudan, Argentina, Mexico and several
other countries.''

   Private exporting companies have sold the
Soviet Union an additional 103,632 metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement.
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the corn was
shifted by exporters from ``unknown destinations'' to the Soviet
Union for 1989-90 delivery.
   Orders since Oct. 1, the beginning of the agreement's new year,
total 160,700 tons of soybeans, 705,000 tons of soybean meal and
7,300 tons of barley.
   U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89 were a record of more than
21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn
and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat.
   In addition, 1988-89 sales included 298,700 tons of soybeans,
1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 103,632 tons of
corn would be about 4.1 million bushels.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or further details were released.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.22 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA's five-day average, meaning that the

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says
that among the things Poland needs to boost food production are
agricultural chemicals, currently the target of environmentalists
and federal regulators in the United States.
   ``We need to do whatever we can to improve agricultural
productivity in Poland,'' Yeutter said Tuesday at the National
Press Club. ``Interestingly, there were two principal requests in
this area.''
   High-protein supplements for livestock feed were one, and
agricultural chemicals were the other.
   ``As we have experienced the situation here where folks are
wanting to ban agricultural chemicals in the United States, the No.
1 priority on the list in Poland was agricultural chemicals,'' he
said.
   But the aid package approved by Congress doesn't include such
chemicals, Yeutter said
   ``There's little that we can do, perhaps nothing that we can do
in the way of agricultural chemicals from a governmental
standpoint.''
   Thus, he said, the private sector may have to meet Poland's
request for farm chemicals through grants and donations.
   Yeutter recently led a presidential mission to Poland to help
determine what kind of aid may be needed to help that country
rebuild its agriculture.

   AIDS groups around the country are applauding
a recommendation that the Bush administration stop screening
international visitors for the AIDS virus.
   ``The HIV policies now enforced by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service are hypocritical, racist and homophobic and
must be abolished,'' said Pat Christen, executive director of the
San Francisco AIDS Foundation.
   The National Commission on AIDS made public a resolution Tuesday
urging the government to stop asking visitors to the United States
if they are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV),
which causes AIDS, and to quit marking the passports of those who
are.
   At least 36 national organizations, including the American Bar
Association, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Red
Cross and the National Lawyers' Guild endorsed the new immigration
resolution.
   Current policies infringe on human rights and dignity ``and they
reinforce a false impression that AIDS and HIV infection are a
general threat,'' said Dr. June E. Osborn, who chairs the
commission. ``In fact they are sharply restricted in their mode of
transmission.''
   ``This policy is discriminatory, it is unjust, it violates basic
human rights, it inflicts unnecessary hardship and embarrassment on
an already suffering community,'' said Charles Carman, president of
the World Federation of Hemophilia.
   ``For too long irrationality, rather than public health, has
governed in this area,'' said Chai R. Feldblum, legislative counsel
to the American Civil Liberties Union's AIDS project.
   The commission said the Immigration and Naturalization Service
routinely questions some U.S. visitors to learn if they are
infected by HIV and that this has already caused several
international groups and agencies to boycott important conferences
to be held in the United States next summer.
   Unless the restrictions are eased, said several spokesmen for
groups concerned with AIDS, many international participants are
expected to stay away from the 6th International Conference on
AIDS, in San Francisco June 20-24, and the 19th International
Congress on Hemophilia, scheduled for Washington in August.
   The commission called for immediate administrative steps to end
questioning of tourists, students and temporary visitors about
their HIV status while applying for visas.
   ``This would eliminate the current practice of stopping
travelers who are carrying AZT, the only licensed anti-HIV drug,
and blood products such as clotting factor used by hemophiliacs,''
the commission said.
   Travel restrictions for people with HIV began two years ago when
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., succeeded in adding HIV to a list of
dangerous contagious diseases considered by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. A waiver process was instituted a year ago
for professional conferences, business travel and medical
conferences, but a code is placed on the passports of those who
receive such waivers.
   Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the American Foundation for
AIDS Research, said in a telephone interview from San Francisco
that the rules should be changed because ``the policy is not going
to serve any significant public health service but the potential
for discrimination is significant with a code in your passport
known to everybody.''
   The resolution called for a comprehensive review by the
Departments of State, Justice and Health and Human Services of
immigration policies relating to communicable diseases, especially
HIV infection.

   Maybe it's sheer lunacy, but thousands of people
have called a 900 number to find out the weather on the moon.
   American Express started its 1-900-WEATHER line Aug. 1,
providing temperatures and forecasts for 600 places around the
world, and one place out of this world.
   It turns out more people have called for the moon's weather than
any other location, except New York City, the company reported
Tuesday.
   ``I think we've struck a whimsical chord among callers,'' said
Jess Bander, an American Express vice president. ``There's a sense
of wonderment about the moon, a fanciful enjoyment.''
   The whimsy has, of course, carried over to the Christmas season,
with North Pole forecasts now available.
   After New York and the moon, the places most frequently asked
about are London, Chicago and Boston, said Bander, who wouldn't say
how many people have called for the moon weather.
   In case you're wondering, it's hot on the sunny half of the
moon, about 264 degrees, and cold on the dark half, about minus
272. It's been like that for millions of years, and the information
is in most encyclopedias.
   But for 75 cents a minute, callers can hear that the relative
humidity on the airless orb is zero percent and that winds are calm.
   If you push a button to get travel reminders, they include, ``A
working space suit and air supply are required.''

   Responding to complaints from French winegrowers,
China has announced that no Chinese drink will be allowed to bear
the name ``champagne.''
   Li Xiaoping, an official from the State Industrial and
Commercial Administration, said China would comply with
international conventions restricting use of the word to wines
grown in the Champagne province of France.
   Many Chinese had believed champagne to be a generic name for
sparkling white wine rather than a product special to one area of
France, he said.
   Quoted in today's official China Daily, Li said China became a
member of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial
Property in 1985 and would obey its stipulations on uses of the
champagne label.
   He said most enterprises have been given until year's end to
remove their ``champagne'' labels, including those producers using
related names such as ``Little Champagne'' or ``Lady's Champagne.''
In some cases, companies will be given until the end of 1990.
   Li said many Chinese-made drinks with ``champagne'' names are
not wines but soft drinks.

``My grad students say I rarely get excited about anything, but I'm

   Orr said the bones were the best representation of ice-age

were found 6 to 9 feet below ground and are 30,000 to 50,000 years
old, Orr said.
   He said the crew's discovery was typical. ``Most major finds

<HEAD>Two Senators Sought Last-Minute Sale of Lincoln S&amp;L</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two senators contend their last-ditch bid to
back the sale of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, and head off
its seizure by federal regulators, was an effort to save taxpayers
a record bailout cost.
   Aides to Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz., acknowledge that the lawmakers were lobbied to back the
sale last spring by a former California congressman, Republican
John H. Rousselot, and Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr., a
major contributor to their campaigns and causes. Rousselot headed
the group that sought to buy the S&amp;L.
   But the senators' discussions with the top thrift regulator _
just days before the government seized Lincoln on April 14 _ were
motivated by a desire to prevent an expected record $2 billion-plus
government bailout of a savings and loan, the aides said in recent
interviews.
   The Lincoln collapse has brought multiple investigations and
lawsuits, including a Senate Ethics Committee review of
intervention by Cranston, DeConcini and three other senators: John
McCain, R-Ariz., Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and John Glenn,
D-Ohio.
   The five received $1.3 million from Keating, his immediate
family and employees, but all five deny any connection between the
money and their intervention with regulators.
   In the frantic week before the seizure of Lincoln, Cranston and
DeConcini discussed a possible sale with M. Danny Wall, the head of
the government's Office of Thrift Supervision who announced his
resignation last week. The contacts are listed in Wall's office
phone logs and memos, and it was confirmed by spokesmen for the
senators and Wall that the Lincoln sale was discussed.
   A sale of Lincoln could have allowed Keating's American
Continental Corp. _ the bank's parent company _ to avoid its filing
for bankruptcy protection on April 13.
   Rousselot, who led a prospective buyers' group just before the
seizure, said, ``I was lobbying to try to get a sale
accomplished.'' Rousselot, in an interview, added that most of his
discussions were with Cranston or his staff.
   Rousselot said he learned right before the senators' phone calls
that a seizure might be imminent.
   He said he was told by a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board that ``It's a good thing you've got this group together''
because otherwise the board staff was preparing to recommend that
Lincoln ``be put into conservatorship.''
   The board took such action after rejecting the Rousselot deal as
inadequate, as it had done with two previous offers.
   Cranston Chief of Staff Roy F. Greenaway said Rousselot wanted
the California senator to ask Wall to let Rousselot ``present his
case'' before top banking officials. The senator passed on the
request, and Rousselot said he did speak directly with the top
officials.
   The aide, who attended the session, said Cranston told the
regulator he ``didn't have any idea of whether the offer by the
Rousselot group met their standards and didn't want to prejudge
that. But if the sale did meet their standards and there was no
reason to object, he urged the sale be approved to save the
taxpayers money.''
   DeConcini spokesman Robert Maynes said that in the last-ditch
discussions to avoid a takeover, DeConcini asked Wall, ``Is there
any way for a sale to go through so Keating could be out and the
institution could be saved, so jobs would not be lost and taxpayers
would not have to foot another savings and loan bill? The answer he
got back in all cases, was `no.'''
   Keating's chief spokesman did not return telephone calls to
comment on the lobbying effort.
   Karl Hoyle, Wall's spokesman and chief of congressional affairs,
said the calls from the senators to Wall were ``appropriate because
we were not being asked to make any conclusions. We were not being
asked to make a deal,'' but were advised ``if there was a deal,
move on it quickly.''
   He said banking officials also hoped for a sale because ``it was
the least expensive way to solve the problem. It was less costly
than paying it off or taking it over.''

   You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy bagels

   ``I would've been Santa Claus whether I was white, black, green,

who devotes much of the year to charities like Jewish Family
Services.
   At Christmas time, he turns into Santa Claus _ in appearances at
schools, parks and churches, but always in poor areas. He spends a
portion of his retirement fund each year on toys.
   Stone said he plays Santa because he likes people, especially
kids.
   ``With the kids,'' he said, ``It's easier to let it out.''
   Silver-haired and jolly most of the time, the retired furniture
maker's representative drives a hard bargain when he's collecting
promised donations for his charitable work.
   ``Well, you tell that no-good (so-and-so) to come up with
something,'' he was overheard telling one donor during a recent
interview.

   Turning 65 as a lame duck is the right way to do

enemies without making big decisions.
   ``I've never been as popular as I am in defeat,'' Koch said at a

really quite interesting.''
   Koch lost the Democratic primary in September to David Dinkins,
who went on to defeat Republican Rudolph Giuliani in the mayoral
election.
   ``I'm not now doing anything more than acting as a caretaker,''
Koch said.
   ``Prior to that, I made major decisions every single day which
involved millions of dollars and millions of people,'' he said.
``And every time you make a major decision, you're going to
alienate somebody.''
   ``In the role of caretaker, I'm not alienating anybody. I don't
have to make any major decisions.''
   Koch has said he will go on the lecture tour and appear in
advertisements after leaving office Jan. 1.

   ``This will be a protest song, not a charity record,'' Hackett

released next year, and money raised from the recording will go to
refugee charities, he said.
   ``I originally wanted to turn up at one of the refugee camps in

productive if I galvanized the music industry into taking some

I used a lot of her in the film,'' a remake of the 1937 Barbara

   ``She was not a single parent like Stella, but we were poor and
she was that generation of women, almost all gone now, who always
put their family ahead of themselves. She worked hard and kept
nothing for herself _ nothing. Never a new dress or new shoes.
   ``She adored me, my mom, and I still have nightmares about her,
because as a grownup, I didn't give her the time I should have. Now
that she's gone, I have regrets.''
   Midler said she is devoted to life with her husband, Martin Von

   ``My daughter says, `I want a baby, I want a baby.' So we're
trying,'' said Ms. Midler. ``I have no fear about doing this at

   Lucky for Thakorial Mistry, there are no
sacred cows in his business.
   Mistry is probably the only Hindu taxidermist in the world. It
might seem strange that a Hindu would make a living stuffing and
mounting animals, for Hindus revere living creatures and believe in
reincarnation.
   The people in his hometown outside Bombay, India, were mostly
vegetarians and would never kill an animal, he said. Only the
poorest and hungriest would eat a chicken, but only behind closed
doors.
   No wonder that Mistry was considered an oddball _ or worse _
when he began his boyhood hobby of taxidermy. His first specimen
was a pigeon, which he grabbed in the rafters of his home,
chloroformed and stuffed with cotton.
   ``It didn't turn out real good but it looked good to me, until
it started to smell,'' Mistry said.
   The boy bagged small birds and chipmunks with a BB gun and
stuffed them in the privacy of his attic bedroom. Mistry's secret
escaped the notice of his father, the town blacksmith and a devout
Hindu, but his neighborhood pals were fascinated.
   ``I always enjoyed opening animals,'' he said. ``I love animals.
My friends thought I was crazy, but when I finished they thought I
had created something beautiful. Even my parents, when they found
out, they liked it too.''
   Mistry arrived in the United States in 1971 with a degree in
chemistry and zoology, about $6 in his pocket and plans for a
career in medical technology. However, he said, ``my hobby turned
into a living.'' After an apprenticeship with taxidermy shops in
Maryland and Virginia, he went into business for himself in 1976.
   His large studio in this rural community south of Washington
D.C. is filled with striking examples of Mistry's artistry,
including deer, bear, bison, pheasant, peacocks, fish and big game
from Alaska to Africa.
   Beneath a mounted shark, a red fox leaps after a pair of grouse
rising in flight. Two gamecocks lunge in battle, their neck
feathers bristling.
   Mistry, 43, assisted by his wife Jyotsna, stuffs about 1,000
creatures annually, at prices ranging from $6 an inch for
freshwater fish to as much as $2,000 for a grizzly bear.
   Business is profitable enough for Mistry, who became a U.S.
citizen in 1979, to support his family of four and to help nearly
two dozen relatives immigrate from India.
   Lounging on the marble floor of his showroom is one customer's
unclaimed white Pekinese dog, one of many small pets that Mistry
has lovingly freeze-dried for their grieving owners.
   The Pekinese would make a dandy doorstop, but Mistry says it's
so lifelike that ``it makes a good guard dog'' to scare would-be
intruders peering through the windows.
   Mistry recalls with a grin the time a husband called to ask,
``Can you stuff my wife?'' On another occasion, a lawyer telephoned
to say his client had written a will requesting that his body be
freeze-dried.
   Mistry turned them both down. ``I could do a human being, but
it's illegal,'' he said. ``Even if it were legal, I wouldn't do
it.''
   How does he feel about stuffing a cow, the most sacred animal in
the Hindu religion?
   ``Sure, I could do a cow,'' Mistry replied. ``No problem. You've
got to change to survive wherever you go. This is America.''

<BYLINE>U.S. Says Prison Terms For Drug Killers `Tantamount to Life' ^By

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are hailing the stiff
sentences handed to a pair of Mexican drug lords convicted of
masterminding the torture-slayings of a U.S. narcotics agent and
his pilot.
   ``My heartfelt congratulations go to the government of Mexico
and its judicial authorities for their decisive and correct
action,'' said John Lawn, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration in Washington.
   Rafael Caro Quintero, 37, and Ernesto Rafael Fonesca Carrillo,
56, were convicted Tuesday of masterminding the 1985 murders of DEA
agent Enrique Camarena and his Mexican pilot and sentenced to 40
years in prison.
   ``There is no chance of these sentences being reduced,''
Attorney General Enrique Castillo de Alvarez said.
   Fernando Arias, a spokesman for the attorney general, said Caro
Quintero and Fonseca would have to serve a total of 74 and 53 years
respectively because of other drug-related convictions. There is no
parole in drug-related cases.
   Lawn said the stiff sentences are ``tantamount to life
imprisonment'' and send a stern warning to other drug kinpins.
   He said it shows that ``no matter how wealthy and powerful their
infamous trade has made these narco-murderers, they are not beyond
the reach of justice.''
   Don Hamilton, spokesman for U.S. drug czar William J. Bennett in
Washington, also praised the convictions and the sentences.
   ``It's certainly nice to see people like Caro Quintero off the
streets,'' he said. ``I think the United States and Mexico will
both be the better for it.''
   The Camarena case badly strained relations between Mexico and
the United States in its early stages because Mexican authorities
allowed Caro Quintero to escape to Costa Rica.
   The United States virtually shut down the border at one point by
searching every Mexican and vehicle trying to enter the United
States.
   DEA acting Deputy Administrator Terrence Burke said in
Washington that he personally informed Camarena's widow and sister
of the convictions.
   ``It was good to be able to call them with good news for once,''
he said. ``They were very pleased that this action was taken by the
courts of Mexico.''
   Caro Quintero was a middleman for Colombian cocaine cartels
smuggling drugs to the United States. His story and the Camarena
killing were the subject of a book and television movie in the
United States, both called ``Desperados.''
   He and Fonseca were tried earlier this year.
   The convictions and sentences were announced Tuesday by Judge
Tomas Hernandez Franco of the 4th Criminal Court in Guadalajara, a
major drug trafficking center 350 miles west of Mexico City where
Camerena was based.
   The U.S. agent was kidnapped there on Feb. 7, 1985. His pilot,
Alfredo Zavala Avelar, was abducted a few days later.
   Their bullet-riddled bodies were found on March 5 in shallow
graves on a ranch 60 miles southeast of Guadalajara, the capital of
Jalisco state.
   Both Camarena and Fonseca are multi-millionaires whose assets
include ranches, aircraft, luxury cars, houses, apartments, hotels
and businesses which the government is in the process of
confiscating.
   Caro Quintero and Fonseca also were sentenced Tuesday on several
other kidnapping, drug trafficking and weapons charges related to
the Camarena case.
   The sentences, which will be served concurrently, add up to 116
years for Caro Quintero and 144 for Fonseca.
   Caro Quintero was sentenced to 34 years in another drug case
earlier this year and Fonseca was given 13 years. These sentences
will run consecutively to those in the Camarena case.
   Ten other men were sentenced to the maximum term of 40 years for
taking part in the killings, and 13 other men received lesser
sentences for their involvement in drug operations run by Caro
Quintero and Fonseca.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: The Peace Dividend and Bush's 60 Minutes of Gloom</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush is throwing himself with verve
into crafting a 1991 budget, trying to decide how to apply a
``peace dividend'' while admitting his own budget chief sometimes
gives him ``60 minutes of gloom.''
   The peace dividend is the savings that will come from lower
defense spending because of reduced tensions in Eastern Europe.
   Although some of his predecessors have approached budget choices
with disdain, Bush has been going over next year's budget
line-by-line in excruciating detail, according to top aides.
   He's had no trouble playing Solomon in refereeing battles
between agency heads and Richard G. Darman, director of the Office
of Management and Budget.
   On defense spending, for instance, he simply split the
difference between the $294 billion in defense outlays sought by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and the $290 billion proposed by
Darman.
   Sources said Bush decided on a final figure of $292 billion _ up
just $1 billion from the current level _ for military spending in
the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1.
   Bush will submit his fiscal 1991 budget to Congress on Jan. 22.
White House and OMB officials say they expect to have final figures
locked in sometime after Christmas.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, the 1991 budget
must reduce the deficit to no more than $64 billion. Since the
current year deficit is expected to be from $100 billion to $105
billion, that suggests Bush must come up with $30 billion to $40
billion in budget savings.
   ``We've got enormous budget problems facing me,'' Bush recently
told a group of reporters who interviewed him in the Oval Office.
   ``I feel very strongly about it because Darman just walked out _
and when you see him walking out, I go through a period of about 60
minutes of gloom before I refocus on what else is happening out
there,'' Bush added.
   Darman is fast earning a reputation as Washington's Christmas
Scrooge.
   And, as some well-placed aides tell it, he's living up to the
characterization placed on him by former colleague and onetime
Budget Director David Stockman: ``He was always asking inconvenient
questions, or seemingly preoccupied with the process _ tactics,
trades, deals, winning.''
   ``It's that time of year. It's December _ time for Christmas and
arm-wrestling with Dick Darman,'' said drug policy director William
Bennett, who has had his own feuds with Darman over spending on the
war on drugs.
   The multimillion-dollar disputes with Darman are common, said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``There's millions and
millions of dollars (in differences) between every agency and
Darman,'' Fitzwater said.
   Darman, a master at strategy, this year devised a new process
under which Cabinet officers who do not want to negotiate cuts in
their programs with the OMB can take their appeals directly to Bush
_ but at a risk.
   The risk is that if Bush turns down their appeal or does not
decide to split the difference as he did with Cheney, they would
have to compete among themselves for a small pool of money reserved
for high-priority programs.
   Some Cabinet members have told Darman no thanks, and have taken
their appeals to Bush anyway _ including Cheney and Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who saw Bush on Tuesday.
   Still, White House officials say Darman's new process has cut
down on the number of direct budget appeals to the president.
   Bush has suggested he will ask for small increases in education,
environmental and crime programs and will renew his request for a
child care tax credit. He also is expected to propose additional
Medicare reductions and a lower capital gains tax.
   Bush insists that any ``peace dividend'' that results from a cut
in U.S. armed forces in Europe will not be spent on other programs.
   A student at a Denver high school asked Bush last week: ``What
are you proposing to do with that money?''
   ``It's to pay off the deficit,'' Bush said.
   Suggestions that defense savings be used to fund domestic
programs are ``some crazy ... wild speculation,'' the president
said. ``I will not acquiesce in that.''

<HEAD>Transferred Police Dog Returning to Memphis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An aging police dog whose transfer to
Atlanta provoked protests by congressmen and schoolchildren, is
returning to Memphis.
   The German shepherd named Magoo was transferred in September by
the Federal Aviation Administration, spurring petitions and angry
letters.
   ``There's no telling how many letters the Department of
Transportation and the FAA may have received,'' police Sgt. Robert
Petrowski, Magoo's former partner and guardian, said Tuesday.
   Magoo first moved to Memphis six years ago as part of an airport
security program. Though assigned to the city dog squad, he
remained FAA property. Memphis police withdrew from the airport
program about a year ago, and the FAA subsequently decided to
transfer Magoo.
   Petrowski collected 7,000 names on a petition he sent to
President Bush. And among those writing on Magoo's behalf were Gov.
Ned McWherter, Tennessee's two U.S. senators and two congressmen.
   ``One teacher at Bartlett Elementary called me and said she had
used (newspaper) stories about Magoo in her class,'' Petrowski
said. ``They had all written letters to the president and letters
to their pen pals, telling them to write letters to the president
to try to get him back.''
   FAA spokesman Jack Barker in Atlanta said his agency reviewed
Magoo's transfer again and agreed to return him to Memphis on the
city's promise he would be available for airport bomb duty if
needed.
   Petrowski said Magoo will continue his general police
assignments and any needed airport work, but at 8 years old, the
dog likely will retire in a year or two.
   Magoo has lived with Petrowski and his family when off duty and
is expected to spend his retirement there as well.
   ``I'm just as happy as I can be,'' Petrowski said, adding that
he expects Magoo to be home in about a week.

   Like their country-and-western counterparts
in the United States, these songs are filled with girlfriends and
gunplay, betrayal and bloodshed.
   The heroes of the popular Mexican songs, however, are cocaine
traffickers. And the villain is often U.S. drug enforcement policy.
   The exploits of drug traffickers _ and sometimes their tragic
fates _ are romanticized in ballads such as ``Death of a Snitch,''
``The Mafia Dies,'' ``White Load,'' ``The Red Car Gang'' and
``Contraband and Treason.''
   ``The Mafia Dies'' by Pepe Cabrera is a classic ``corrido,'' or
Mexican storytelling ballad, filled with nostalgia for the way
things were before a great shootout in Sinaloa state wiped out
whole families of ``narcotraficantes.''
   ``Tierra Blanca is so sad and its streets are deserted,'' goes
the refrain to a slow oom-pah-pah beat and an accordion's lamenting
counterpoint.
   ``New cars don't cruise there and the roar of machine guns is
heard no more. The mansions of those who were kings are today
abandoned.''
   The popularity of ballads about smuggling illustrates how
attitudes can differ on the supply side of the drug problem. Mexico
is a shipper, not a consumer or even much of a producer. The drug
trade has bestowed wealth, not crack houses and cocaine babies.
   In the supply-side subculture, cocaine kingpins can be popular
heroes, Robin Hoods who take from rich, decadent gringos and give
to poor Mexicans. They are often philanthropists who command their
community's loyalty like benevolent feudal lords. Their foot
soldiers are daring men who brave hails of bullets, fierce
``federales'' and treachery.
   By tradition, corridos comment on current events, on the famous
_ and the infamous. Many of the old songs are about revolutionaries.
   The smuggling corridos are a contemporary variation that
coincides with the rise in the drug trade in Mexico.
   Shortly after Rafael Caro Quintero was arrested in the 1985
murder of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent, a
``corrido'' to him appeared.
   ``It took 10 federal agents to guard him because he was a fine
fighting cock,'' the song goes. ``Guys like that aren't born every
day.''
   Caro Quintero, a key Mexican link with the Colombian cartels,
also is compared to the lion, a king of beasts even when caged:
``The beast is now behind bars, but you can hear his roar in the
midnight hours.''
   Although traditional Mexican music is popular in Colombia,
smuggling songs are not, perhaps because they are of more recent
vintage.
   But collectors and music industry executives believe they have a
select following in Colombia, where one cocaine kingpin, the
billionaire Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha of Medellin, is such an
aficionado of things Mexican that his nickname is ``El Mexicano.''
   Some smuggling corridos are distinctly anti-American in tone.
   One corrido about Caro Quintero _ who was convicted and
sentenced to 40 years in prison on Tuesday _ laments thousands of
peasants losing their jobs when one of his huge marijuana
plantations, Hacienda Bufalo, was dismantled at the insistence of
U.S. authorities.
   There is also a corrido about the Honduran drug kingpin Juan
Ramon Matta Ballesteros, whose 1988 extradition sparked
anti-American riots in Honduras that left at least five dead and a
U.S. Embassy annex burned.
   Matta, a member of Colombia's Cali cartel, was convicted of
cocaine smuggling Sept. 6 in Los Angeles.
   There have been attempts to squelch the smuggling corridos in
Mexico, where the war on drugs has been vigorously pursued under
the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   In 1987, Gov. Francisco Labastida Ochoa of Sinaloa, a state
famous for its drug trade and the birthplace of Caro Quintero,
called on broadcasters to stop airing smuggling corridos.
   ``He argued that this type of song is really an apology for
crime, something that encourages the narcotrafficking subculture,''
said Labastida's spokesman, Mario Busio.
   The Sinaloa broadcasters and the governor signed an accord,
Busio said, sealing the pact with a ceremonial shattering of
several offending records.
   ``Since that date, the accord has held,'' Busio said.
   Elsewhere in Mexico, however, the bands play on. As long as
there is a demand, there will be a supply.
   ``This is a company that has to sell records to survive, no?''
said Miguel Angel Medina, a producer for the Mexican division of
EMI Capitol. ``If the market demands a particular type of music,
we'll do it.''

<HEAD>Bush Signs Bill to Trigger New Steel Trade Program With 28 Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is extending steel import
restraints on 28 trading partners, while giving the nations
incentives to stop subsidizing their steel industries.
   Renewal of the curbs through March 1992 will ``eliminate
trade-distorting practices in the steel sector,'' Bush said in a
statement Tuesday.
   The old pacts, negotiated by the Reagan administration in 1984,
expired on Sept. 30.
   The legislation signed by Bush authorizes the federal government
to continue the curbs for another 2{ years. The curbs, negotiated
individually with leading steel-exporting nations, place annual,
product-by-product limits on the volume of steel that can be
shipped to the United States.
   Negotiators in the office of U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills announced Tuesday that the talks had been recently completed
with all nations targeted by the administration. The talks had to
be conducted before Bush signed the bill so that the import program
would not lapse.
   The resulting new pacts will hold the foreign share of the U.S.
steel market to 19.1 percent in the first year of the program,
Hills said in a statement.
   She said import restraint agreements had been finalized with the
12-nation European Community and Australia, Austria, Brazil,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Finland, Hungary, Japan, South Korea,
Mexico, the Peoples Republic of China, Poland, Romania, Trinidad
and Tobago, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.
   Bush's signature on the ``Steel Trade Liberalization Act'' had
been expected for some time.
   Not only did Bush promise to renew import curbs during the 1988
campaign, but his administration orchestrated a compromise last
summer between lawmakers favoring a five-year extension of the
restraints and congressional opponents who wanted the program ended.
   The idea behind the original pacts was to give domestic
steelmakers breathing space from subsidized, foreign competition.
   Many steel-state lawmakers had pushed the administration to
extend the curbs for another five years, but Bush opted for a
smaller-scale program in deference to steel-using manufacturers.
The manufacturers argued that the quotas have driven up prices and
caused supply shortages of some steel products.
   Bush called the country-by-county agreements a ``stepping
stone'' to the day when all trade-distorting subsidies could be
eliminated.
   The program is structured to give nations incentives to trade
freely.
   For example, the pacts allow some countries' market shares to
rise by 1 percentage point per year until quotas are phased out
entirely at the end of the program. Hills said the yearly increase
will be allocated to nations that exhibit the most willingness to
stop subsidizing their domestic steelmakers.
   Some nations have already been granted such status, Hills said.
She identified those Tuesday as the European Community, Japan,
South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Australia and Trinidad and Tobago.

<TEXT>
   Legislation that would scrap ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' as the national anthem has riled people in
the hometown of Francis Scott Key, who wrote the song 175 years ago.
   ``I honestly feel they should leave it be,'' said Harry L.
Decker, Frederick's historian. ``I think it's more like a hymn than
a song. It brings tears to a lot of people's eyes.''
   Rep. Andrew Jacobs Jr., D-Ind., has introduced legislation in
Congress for the ninth time in 12 years to supplant it with
``America the Beautiful.''
   Decker said Tuesday he thought the campaign for change was being
fueled by people who believe the song embraces war and by those who
think it's too hard to sing.
   ``If they can't sing it, they can't sing,'' Decker said.
   David Maloney Jr., president of the Historical Society of
Frederick County, said he liked ``America the Beautiful,'' but
thinks it's less ``emotionally stirring'' than ``The Star-Spangled
Banner.''
   The proposal to replace the national anthem also has struck a
sensitive chord with the Frederick Keys, the city's new minor
league baseball team.
   ``His monument (in Mount Olivet Cemetery) faces our new
stadium,'' said Mark Zeigler, the team's assistant general manager.
``I've got a lot of pride in this area and the state.
   ``This is something of local significance that is national. It
would take away some of the significance.''
   Frederick County Arts Council Director Carole Werking said: ``I
like `America the Beautiful.' I think it is easier to sing, but
Francis Scott Key being Frederick's native son and having a lot of
pride in my community, I don't think we should change it.''
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer has written to Maryland's
congressional delegation, urging them to oppose any change.
   Jacobs said the protests probably are unnecessary because he
doesn't think his bill will pass.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed
above the 38,000-point level for the first time Wednesday, while
the dollar moved lower against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 258.89
points, or 0.68 percent, ending the day at 38,062.42, yet another
high. The index had risen 50.86 points on Tuesday.
   The dollar ended trading at 143.70 yen, down 0.77 yen from
Tuesday's 144.47-yen close. The U.S. currency opened at 143.80 yen
and ranged between 143.35 and 143.90 yen.
   The dollar remained weaker against other currencies following
its slump against the West German mark in New York overnight, said
a Bank of Tokyo trader, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. unit fell in New York, where the mark and the Swiss
franc surged against the dollar and other major currencies due to
the recent pro-democracy movements in Eastern Europe as well as
expectations for an interest rate hike in West Germany, dealers
said.
   ``Although the dollar fluctuated less in Tokyo, it continued to
weaken against the mark, which resulted in the yen's relative
strength against the dollar,'' the Bank of Tokyo trader said.
   On the stock exchange, the market's main barometer rose quickly
in early trading as overnight gains in the Dow Jones average of 30
major industrial issues in New York and the yen's recovery against
the dollar reassured participants, dealers said.
   Tomoyuki Morimoto, a dealer with New Japan Securities, Co., said
purchases by speculative investors contributed to the index's rise.
   He said they bought spot issues of the Nikkei and sold other
issues in the futures market to take profits out of the price gap
between the two markets.
   But market players were gradually becoming worried about the
speed of gains in the index, he said.

<HEAD>Poor Enforcement Allows Violation of Rules in Oil and Gas Leasing
Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department is allowing many
violations of environmental regulations under its oil and gas
leasing program because of lax monitoring, according to an internal
audit.
   The report by the department's Inspector General's Office said
Tuesday that oil and gas lease operators on federal or Indian lands
``who commit violations ... often do so without fear of being
punished'' because civil penalties are rarely assessed.
   Even when lease operators are shown to be repeat offenders,
their poor record often was swept clean without monetary penalties
if corrections on specific violations were made, the investigators
added.
   The report covered the federal Bureau of Land Management's
scrutiny of oil and gas leases throughout the West during a
two-year period beginning in fiscal 1988.
   Investigators focused on activities in eight bureau offices with
jurisdiction over more than 39,000 oil and gas wells, about half of
those under the federal program. All the wells are either on
federal or Indian land.
   Bureau spokesman Bob Johns said the agency was reviewing the
report, but that the bureau agreed generally with many of the
findings and recommendations. A formal response by the agency is
expected to be completed by February, he said.
   ``Violations of existing regulations have resulted in
environmental damage, lost or unpaid royalties, and a potentially
substantial government liability for plugging abandoned wells and
cleaning up well sites,'' the report said.
   The report said that during fiscal 1988, federal inspectors
uncovered 1,317 violations of environmental regulations and other
infractions but assessed only $11,500 in penalties.
   Among the violations were 277 that were considered ``major,''
the report said.
   In many cases, however, environmental violations and
questionable activities by lease holders went unnoticed because of
inadequate checks on well abandonments, venting practices and other
activities, the investigators said.
   Among the findings were:
   _Lease operators are being widely allowed to abandon wells
without getting required government approval, leaving no clear
picture as to how many wells are productive or whether abandoned
wells have been properly closed.
   In some cases, wells were found to have been abandoned 15 years
or more without an authorized inspectors' approval and certainty of
their environmental condition.
   _Unauthorized venting or flaring of natural gas, some dating to
the 1960s, is widespread among lease operators, posing
environmental concerns and preventing the government from
collecting royalties _ about $291,000 for an estimated 1 billion
cubic feet of gas in the limited number of cases documented.
   _Bonding requirements are inadequate to protect against smaller
lease operators abandoning sites without taking proper
environmental precautions. In many cases, the government will have
to assume responsibility.
   ``There could be a significant number of wells throughout the
country which are either plugged improperly or not plugged and ...
these wells could be adversely impacting the environment,'' the
report said.
   The cost of potentially capping some 22,000 wells in question
was put at more than $300 million.
   Some of the cases cited involved:
   _A Montana lease holder who was told he had to test only nine of
his 150 wells to determine whether all of them should be considered
temporarily closed, operating or be in line for capping. ``They did
not want to overburden (him),'' the report said.
   _A California lease purchaser who was allowed to buy 30 closed
or temporarily abandoned wells with a bond of only $25,000. After
he filed for bankruptcy without capping any of the wells, the
government was left with a $378,000 bill.
   _A lease operator who was shown on videotape dumping extracted
saltwater into an unlined, unauthorized pit in violation of
environmental regulations. Although the operator was told in 35
letters over a two-month period to correct the practice, no
monetary penalty was assessed.
   _A well on Indian land that blew after a lease holder began
extracting natural gas without having conducted promised pressure
tests. He was fined only $5,000 although up to 4 million cubic feet
of gas a day were released over 65 days, causing the evacuation of
nearby residents and raising concern that local water supplies may
have been contaminated.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, saying ``the times are on the
side of peace,'' credits religious faith with helping promote
freedom in Eastern Europe and the Philippines.
   The president paid tribute to U.S. Roman Catholic cardinals at a
Catholic University of America banquet Tuesday that also celebrated
the university's reaching the halfway mark in a $100 million
fund-raising drive.
   Bush said the Catholic Church ``time and again'' has stood for
freedom in Eastern Europe ``where democracy is on the march'' and
in the Philippines, where the Aquino government is struggling ``to
preserve a hard-won democracy.''
   ``Today, the times are on the side of peace. Because the world,
increasingly, is on the side of God,'' said Bush.
   In Latin America, an area where the church has at times been
critical of U.S. policy, Bush called for a renewed commitment to
liberty.
   In El Salvador, he condemned ``terrorism and murder, whatever
the ideology,'' and promised, ``we will do everything we can to
bring to justice those who murdered the six Jesuit priests.''
   The six priests were slain along with their housekeeper and her
daughter last month by armed men who invaded their rectory at the
Jesuit university in San Salvador. Some church groups have accused
government troops of the killings.
   ``In Nicaragua, too, we cannot rest until liberty's victory is
won. We want this to be the first hemisphere made up entirely of
free, democratic countries,'' said the president.
   Bush said that at the Dec. 2-3 summit with Mikhail S. Gorbachev
off Malta, he and the Soviet president talked of ``the freedom to
dismantle barriers between nations. And how principles based on
conscience can move mountains or _ as in East Berlin _ even move a
wall.''
   The president recalled that Gorbachev told Pope John Paul II
before the Malta summit that ``the moral values that religion
embodied for centuries can help in the work of renewal of our
country'' and that ``this (renewal) is already happening.''
   ``What a wonderful message for this Christmas season _ a message
of the renewal which springs from faith, hope, generosity,
freedom,'' said Bush. ``What a wonderful legacy to leave our
children _ the knowledge that God can live without man, but man
cannot live without God.''
   The dinner honored Cardinals John O'Connor of New York, Bernard
Law of Boston, Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, James Hickey of
Washington, Edmund Szoka of Detroit and John Krol of Philadelphia.
Krol is retired.
   Two other American cardinals, William Baum, the former
archbishop of Washington who is now prefect of the Congregation for
Seminaries and Institute of Study in Rome, and John Carberry, the
retired archbishop of St. Louis, were not at the dinner.

<HEAD>Report: FBI Gathered Evidence on Mayor's Alleged Drug Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An FBI report includes evidence the agency
believes could support allegations that Mayor Marion Barry used
drugs, but it does not recommend whether an indictment should be
sought, according to a published report.
   The Washington Post today cited anonymous sources who said
prosecutors have not made any decision on whether charges against
Barry should be filed.
   After six years of intermittent federal inquiries on the mayor's
conduct, the report represents the first focus on a possible case
against Barry, the newspaper said.
   The sources say the report makes it clear that the FBI has
concluded it has obtained enough information for prosecutors to
decide whether to seek an indictment against Barry, the Post
reported.
   It was expected to cover the alleged use of illegal drugs by the
mayor and whether he committed perjury when he testified before a
grand jury in January concerning his relationship with convicted
cocaine dealer Charles Lewis, the Post said.
   Lewis, who is cooperating with federal investigators, testified
Tuesday before the grand jury and was expected to return on
Thursday.
   Sections of the report were sent to U.S. Attorney Jay B.
Stephens, sources told the paper. The decision on whether to go
further rests with Stephens.
   R. Kenneth Mundy, the mayor's attorney, said Barry is
``absolutely innocent'' of any wrongdoing. He said Barry ``is not
concerned'' about any case that would be based on allegations by
Lewis.
   ``He's (Lewis) trying to save himself,'' Mundy told the Post.
``We're not bedeviled by Charles Lewis. This is a man who would lie
about anything.''
   ``This is another example of the Post vendetta to get the mayor
out of office,'' said Lurma Rackley, the mayor's press secretary.
``The media should let the case be tried in the courts and not in
the press.''

   Billionaire Leona Helmsley told a judge she was
``in the middle of a nightmare'' before he declared her
unremorseful, sentenced her to four years in prison and ordered her
to pay $8.8 million for tax evasion.
   Mrs. Helmsley, portrayed as a regal perfectionist in
advertisements for her hotel empire, sobbed and begged for mercy at
her sentencing Tuesday.
   But U.S. District Judge John M. Walker Jr. was unswayed, saying
``naked greed'' caused her downfall.
   ``You believed you were above the law and displayed no remorse
or contrition,'' said Walker. ``You bear the full responsibility
for this scheme with all of its fraudulent permutations. ... You
were at the apex of the pyramid of wrongdoing.''
   Besides prison, Walker imposed three years' probation and 750
hours of community service, recommending that she work at a Harlem
home for infants born addicted to drugs. She would be eligible for
parole after 16 months.
   Walker also fined her $7.1 million and ordered one other penalty
on the woman once said to have boasted to a maid: ``We don't pay
taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.'' She must repay close to
$1.7 million in back taxes and bear the government's costs in
bringing her to justice.
   ``No person,'' he said, ``no matter how wealthy and prominent,
stands above the law.''
   As the 69-year-old Mrs. Helmsley made her tearful appeal to the
judge, her ailing 80-year-old husband, Harry, sat three rows away.
   ``I am more humiliated and ashamed than anybody can ever imagine
that I've been found guilty of a serious crime,'' said Mrs.
Helmsley, dressed in black. ``I feel like I'm in the middle of a
nightmare. ...
   ``A few years ago, I lost my only son,'' she said, adding that
it ``ripped me apart'' when she saw photographs of his grave
published.
   ``I beg you, don't let me lose Harry, too,'' she said. ``Our
whole life has been work and each other. Please don't. We have
nothing else.''
   The Helmsleys, with a personal fortune of $1 billion, have $5
billion in real estate holdings, including 27 hotels and the Empire
State Building.
   Mrs. Helmsley was convicted of evading more than $1.2 million in
federal taxes between 1983 and 1985 by billing personal expenses
through the Helmsley business. She has appealed the Aug. 30 verdict
that found her guilty of 33 counts of tax evasion, and she remains
free on unspecified bail.
   After the sentencing, Mrs. Helmsley walked down the courthouse
steps with her husband while a crowd taunted her.
   ``Four years in jail, you should have got more,'' shouted one
bystander.
   Among the expenses she was found to have fraudulently billed to
her business was the construction of a $1.1 million enclosure for
the swimming pool of the Helmsley's 28-room mansion in Greenwich,
Conn.
   Other expenses were much smaller _ $58 for leg waxing, for
example.
   Since her indictment, Mrs. Helmsley has been vilified in court
and out. She was a high-profile target; her picture is part of
nearly every ad for the Helmsleys' hotels. The ad for Manhattan's
Helmsley Palace describes it as ``the only palace in the world
where the queen stands guard.''
   Even her own lawyer described her as a ``tough bitch'' in
opening arguments. Employees who testified at her trial described
her as a capricious, despotic boss.
   Mrs. Helmsley told the judge that coverage of the trial had
forced her and her husband to hide from the public in their house.
   Her attorney, Gerald Feffer, told Walker his client had become a
``lightning rod'' for anti-Semitic hate mail and death threats.
   ``She has been ridiculed, abused and humiliated in an
unprecedented way, having nothing to do with her wrongdoing,'' he
said.
   Two Helmsley employees also were convicted. Joseph Licari
received 30 months in prison, three years' probation and a $75,000
fine, and Frank Turco received a two-year term, three years'
probation and a $50,000 fine.
   Her husband also was charged, but prosecutors dropped his case
because he was found mentally incompetent.

   A few weeks after he broke up a fight in his
courtroom, Judge Bob Musseman chased down a fugitive who had bolted
from the courthouse.
   Larry Dean Freeman, 30, was in the Tulsa County court Tuesday to
face a traffic violation. But during the case, Musseman learned
Freeman was wanted on two felony warrants.
   Freeman ``started getting antsy'' and asked whether he could
step into the hall for some water, said court clerk Cathy Ardey.
   Musseman followed and was knocked down when Freeman suddenly
turned and struck him in the chest with an elbow, authorities said.
   ``He was able to get up first because I was tangled up in my
robe,'' Musseman said.
   The chase continued outside until Musseman yelled he would catch
Freeman no matter how far they ran. Freeman surrendered.
   Last month, after Musseman broke up a fight between two women,
co-workers awarded him a cape and mask and snickered about the
``Bat Judge.'' In June, Musseman helped collar a man who tried to
flee his trial.
   ``I'm three and oh,'' Musseman said.

   Workers at several government nuclear weapons
plants face unnecessary risks of radiation contamination, in part
because too little is spent on protective measures, according to
Energy Department inspection reports.
   The problem persists despite greatly increased attention in
recent years to health, safety and environmental hazards at the
weapons plants.
   Flaws in worker protection against radiation are a recurring,
though little publicized, theme in recently released health and
safety reports following inspections of facilities in four states.
   The inspections by government and private experts, ordered by
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins in June, document radiation
control problems at the Pantex weapons assembly factory near
Amarillo, Texas; the Y-12 nuclear materials manufacturing plant at
Oak Ridge, Tenn.; the Fernald uranium processing plant near
Cincinnati, Ohio, and the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant
near Denver, Colo.
   Inspections also were conducted at weapons sites in Kansas City,
Mo., Mercury, Nev., and Piketon, Ohio, but the results have not yet
been publicly released. All 17 major weapons facilities eventually
are to undergo such inspections.
   The Pantex report published last week said that while inspectors
found no clear and immediate danger to worker safety, the radiation
protection program was generally inadequate as evidenced by
``extensive'' violations of federal regulations.
   The report said the Energy Department and the company that runs
Pantex under a government contract, Mason &amp; Hanger-Silas Mason Co.,
have been aware of the problem for several years, yet ``little has
been achieved to correct it.''
   In a memo attached to the Pantex report, Watkins said the
findings indicate workers are not adequately protected from routine
and emergency releases of radiation. He ordered immediate action to
fix the problems.
   In late October, Watkins ordered special action to correct
weaknesses in radiation protection at the Y-12 plant at the federal
Oak Ridge nuclear reservation.
   The Y-12 inspection team reported a variety of major problems.
Among them was a failure of the plant's health physics specialists
to routinely check radiation levels in all areas where significant
amounts of radiation could be present.
   The report also said radiation survey results often are poorly
documented, and that the plant does not routinely check for flaws
in warning devices and other safety features of equipment that
generates radiation. For example, such checks are not routinely
done on electron-beam welders, which produce radiation fields
comparable to, and sometimes higher than, X-ray machines, the
report said.
   The inspectors said no health physics specialists were present
to monitor radiation levels when workers removed an air filter from
the roof of a building at the Y-12 plant, ``despite the potential
for spreading contamination on the roof and also for an unmonitored
release of airborne radiation.''
   Also, the report said ``safety work permits'' prepared for
employees at Y-12 were ``not an effective means of informing
workers of the radiological conditions that may be encountered at
the job site.''
   Significant flaws in radiation protection also were found by
inspectors at Fernald, where production lines were closed earlier
this year because of pressing environmental problems.
   Workers at one Fernald building may have unknowingly ingested
radioactive uranium metal aerosols because of ventilation defects
in an area where workers are not required to wear respirators, the
inspection report of last August said.
   Only limited corrections can be made at Fernald because of a
lack of money, the report said. Budget problems also prevent a
quick correction of deficiencies in training of radiation workers
and radiation protection technicians, the report said.
   Inspectors of the Rocky Flats plant, which makes plutonium
triggers for nuclear weapons, cited a variety of radiation
contamination problems, including uncertainty about the accuracy of
measurements of plutonium particles in the air. They said the
measuring equipment is old and prone to breakdowns.
   Rocky Flats' plutonium operations were shut down last month for
a management shakeup. Last year the plant was closed for several
months after two employees walked unknowingly into a contaminated
area and inhaled radioactive particles.

   Once she was a cigarette girl. Later, she became
a queen. Now, Leona Helmsley is a felon facing the prospect of
trading her ermine robes for prison stripes.
   Mrs. Helmsley won't immediately lose her freedom. She was
sentenced to four years in prison, but has appealed her conviction
for evading $1.2 million in taxes and remains free on bail.
   She has long since lost the royal aura projected in ads
featuring her and promoting her hotels, which described the
flagship Helmsley Palace as ``the only palace in the world where
the queen stands guard.''
   During her trial, Mrs. Helmsley was revealed as a woman who
charged underwear and other purchases to her business; who fiercely
and vituperatively berated employees, firing them on a whim; who
mocked the law.
   ``We don't pay taxes,'' a maid quoted Mrs. Helmsley as saying.
``Only the little people pay taxes.''
   The trial was open season on Leona. In opening arguments, her
own attorney labeled her ``a tough bitch.'' In closing, a
prosecutor attacked her ``selfishness, greed and sheer arrogance.''
   She was scorned almost universally. Mayor Edward I. Koch called
her ``the wicked witch.'' Donald Trump said she was ``a sick
woman.''
   Leona Mindy Rosenthal was born 69 years ago. Her father was a
Brooklyn hatmaker.
   She has had several careers; she was a showroom model and a
Chesterfield cigarette girl. Later, she became a successful real
estate broker.
   She met real estate titan Harry Helmsley in 1971. He hired her
as a $500,000-a-year senior vice president and married her a year
later, divorcing his wife of 33 years.
   Leona Helmsley had been married before, too. She divorced her
lawyer husband in 1959. She had a son by that marriage, Jay
Panzirer; she cried in court when his death in 1982 was mentioned,
though she had taken his widow to court to deny her money from her
son's estate.
   Mrs. Helmsley's devotion to her husband and his devotion to her
have never been questioned. She calls him ``gorgeous one ...
pussycat ... snooky, wooky, dooky.'' For her birthday, he lighted
the Empire State Building _ in which he holds a major stake _ red,
white and blue.
   The Helmsleys head a real estate empire valued at $5 billion,
and their personal wealth is estimated at $1 billion. They live
lavishly in Palm Beach, Fla.; at a duplex atop Manhattan's Park
Lane Hotel; and at their 28-room mansion, Dunnellen Hall, in
Greenwich, Conn.
   Dunnellen Hall was at the center of the allegations against the
Helmsleys. Helmsley, 80, originally was charged, but he was found
incompetent for trial because of diminished mental capacity.
   Mrs. Helmsley was convicted of charging to the business millions
of dollars spent to renovate the home.
   For the moment, she can still enjoy the marble dance floor on
the roof of a pool enclosure, the $130,000 indoor-outdoor sound
system, the jade art objects that cost $500,000.
   But the judge decided Tuesday that she would have to leave all
that behind. He ordered a four-year prison sentence. She would be
eligible for parole after 16 months.

<HEAD>Boy Scouts, PTA Battle Over Screening Scout Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER KERR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boy Scouts and the PTA, two
``apple pie'' groups, can't agree on who's responsible for the
``bad apple'' scout leaders who sometimes lead to another American
tradition _ lawsuits.
   The California Congress of Parents, Teachers and Students Inc.,
the state PTA, this fall told its local chapters to stop sponsoring
Boy Scout troops and Cub Scout packs, after the national PTA and
the Boy Scouts of America failed to agree on responsibility for
screening leaders.
   PTAs in some other states have taken similar action, officials
said.
   Of the 10,000 scout units in California, about 600, mostly Cub
Scout packs, are currently sponsored by neighborhood school PTAs,
according to Richard Parker, assistant director of the Western
Region of the Boys Scouts of America.
   PTAs and scout units have co-existed for 50 years, with parents
from one group often deeply involved in the other. Scout troops
also can be sponsored by other organizations such as church or
civic clubs.
   Concerned about lawsuits stemming from child abuse or other
misguidance by scout leaders, the national scouts and PTA have been
struggling to come up with a compromise since last year on new
charter application forms written by the Boy Scouts of America. The
forms place the responsibility for screening, selecting and
approving local scout leaders on the sponsors.
   ``Who can better assess them?'' asked Lee Sneath, a Dallas
publicist for Boy Scouts of America.
   But National PTA President Manya Ungar wrote in an October 1988
letter to state and local PTAs, ``this responsibility could result
in increased liability to PTA units, and possibly to their leaders,
should some unfortunate situation develop involving the leadership
of the local scout organization.''
   The two national groups began negotiations in mid-1988 that
continued through this year. The Boy Scouts agreed not to change
its charter arrangements with the PTA until July 1, 1989.
   That deadline passed without a resolution, and the National PTA
informed its state chapters that it was leaving the decision about
sponsorship to them.
   ``We have nothing that says they can or cannot sponsor Boy Scout
troops. That's up to the local units,'' said Tari Marshall, public
relations director for the National PTA.
   She said a few states have recommended that local units not sign
charters.
   The Illinois PTA advised its local units not to do so in October
1988, said Illinois President Gretchen McDowell. ``Our liability
insurance put a waiver in so it will not cover any Boy Scout
activity.''
   ``We know it's a very difficult issue,'' she said. ``My kids
were Boy Scouts. It has nothing to do with a very fine
organization, the Boy Scouts. It has to do with us accepting
responsibility for their leaders.''
   She said other youth groups, such as Girl Scouts, recruit and
train their own leaders and do not require sponsoring organization
to accept responsibility for the leaders.
   California PTA president Dorothy Leonard, who sent letters to
local chapters advising them of the cutoff in September, said she
plans to meet with Parker to try to resolve the problem.
   ``We do have a problem, but we believe it can be worked out,''
Parker said recently.
   But Marshall, of the Chicago-based National PTA, said meetings
have been fruitless.
   ``Really, it's up to Boy Scouts to come back to us if they feel
they want to make a change,'' she said.
   Parker notes that the Boy Scouts of America carries liability
insurance for all its registered leaders. But PTA officials are
worried that courts might interpret the new charter forms as
putting the onus on their organizations.
   Parker said if a school's PTA won't sponsor a scout group, then
a group of parents in the neighborhood could get together and sign
the charter.

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Law Allowing Prosecution of Alleged Nazi War
Criminals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament's decision to allow the government to
prosecute alleged Nazi war criminals is expected to result in the
trials of at least three aging emigres suspected of the mass murder
of Jews.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
Angeles, which first brought the issue to the attention of British
authorities, issued a statement after Tuesday's vote that said:
   ``The British Parliament's decision is not an act of vengeance
but a victory for justice. It states clearly that crimes against
humanity can take no refuge in the passing of time, and keeps faith
with the victims of the Holocaust.''
   Home Secretary David Waddington urged the trials, saying, ``It
is the instinctive wish of most us to get on with our lives in
peace and not to rake over the past. But sometimes one is brought
face to face with facts that cannot be buried.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and opposition Labor Party
leader Neil Kinnock both voted in favor of prosecution, which
passed 348-123.
   In order for the prosecutions to proceed, Parliament must pass
further legislation that would enable naturalized British citizens
to be prosecuted for crimes committed abroad. The office of the
Director of Public Prosecutions would decide whether individual
prosecutions should go ahead.
   Australia and Canada have passed similar legislation within the
past few years. The U.S. Justice Department investigates and
deports suspects for trial in Israel.
   The action in Parliament followed the publication of a
government-commissioned report July 24 saying there is enough
evidence to prosecute four suspects, one of whom has since died. It
urged further investigation in another 124 cases.
   The suspects were not identified in the report published after a
year-long investigation by two prominent lawyers, including Sir
Thomas Hetherington, Britain's former Director of Public
Prosecutions.
   The inquiry was set up after the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which
accused Britain of foot-dragging on the issue, submitted a list of
suspects to the government in 1986.
   Almost all the suspects in Britain are from Lithuania, Latvia
and the Ukraine in the Soviet Union.
   One suspect, Antanas Gecas, 73, a Lithuanian-born mining
engineer living in Scotland, has been identified by the British
media. He has acknowledged witnessing atrocities while serving in a
notorious Lithuanian police battalion. But he says he only watched
and is the victim of a Soviet smear campaign.
   The issue has deeply divided legislators. Opponents argued
during Tuesday's debate that prosecutions 45 years after the end of
World War II will turn into show trials, rekindling old hatreds
with witnesses who are unreliable because of age and bent on
revenge.
   ``Most of the witnesses are either senile, infirm or dead,''
said Conservative Party legislator Winston Churchill, grandson of
Britain's World War II leader. ``This would lead to the
establishment of show trials in this country and has no place in
British justice.''
   Supporters argued passionately that Britain should not remain
what several called ``a safe haven for monsters.''
   ``These are not crimes committed in the heat of battle,'' said
legislator Sir Bernard Braine. ``These are cases of the murder of
non-combatants and the slaughter of whole communities of women and
children.''

<HEAD>House Panel Begins Probe Into Seabrook Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel has launched an investigation of
``apparently contradictory'' methods used by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission in deciding whether to allow the Seabrook nuclear plant
to open.
   Rep. Peter Kostmeyer, D-Pa., chairman of the House Interior
Committee oversight and investigations subcommittee, notified NRC
chairman Kenneth Carr of the inquiry in a letter sent Tuesday.
   Legislators from around New England called for the investigation
last month after the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
recommended that Seabrook be awarded a license.
   Kostmeyer cited a recent dispute in which the licensing board
downplayed concerns raised by the NRC's higher level Atomic Safety
and Licensing Appeal Board about the adequacy of New Hampshire
evacuation plans.
   Ron Sher, spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee Electric Co., the
operator of the plant for the multi-company owning consortium,
said, ``Seabrook station has been the most closely scrutinized
nuclear plant ever licensed, and in the 18-year licensing history
of Seabrook, intervenors have had ample opportunity to make their
case.''

<HEAD>Jailed Woman Urged to Cooperate with Salvadoran Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Salvadoran ambassador to the United States
says the American woman jailed after an arms cache was found at her
San Salvador apartment would probably be released if she cooperates
with police.
   Ambassador Miguel Angel Salaverria met Tuesday with Rep. Nancy
Johnson, a Republican from Jennifer Casolo's home state of
Connecticut.
   Salaverria, speaking with reporters after the briefing, said
Casolo may have been unaware of arms hidden in her backyard, but
``She needs to say who she rented the house from. ... The more she
cooperates, the easier it will be to end the case.''
   Casolo, 28, went to El Salvador in 1985 to work for Christian
Education Seminars, a group dedicated to influencing U.S. policy by
organizing tours for Americans to learn about the civil war there.
   She was arrested Nov. 26 after police found mortar grenades,
dynamite, detonators and thousands of rounds of ammunition in the
backyard of the house where she was living. She is being held for
90 days pending an investigation into possible links between her,
the explosives and Salvadoran rebel forces.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviet Tests Intended to Avoid Military Incidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet military ran through
procedures designed to prevent potentially dangerous clashes last
week over the Bering Sea as the two countries conducted
communication tests for the first time.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the Dec. 6-8 exercise was
designed to show that the two nations' armed forces can cooperate
in anticipation of an agreement scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1.
That accord is supposed to regulate the operation of military
forces near each other.
   Williams said the tests involved ships, aircraft and
ground-based air traffic control and monitoring facilities of both
U.S. and Soviet armed forces.
   U.S. and Soviet aircraft met at specific locations ``and
communicated directly to each other,'' Williams said.
   The tests over the Bering Sea _ which divides Alaska from the
Soviet Union _ included the aircraft from each nation flying over
the other's territory.

   Three desert motor races have been declared
extinct, a victory for environmentalists in the battle to save the
desert tortoise.
   Angry off-roaders said Tuesday their way of life is the real
target.
   The annual Barstow-to-Las Vegas motorcycle race, the Johnson
Valley-to-Parker, Ariz., race and SCORE's Parker 400, for all types
of off-road vehicles, will be denied operating permits
indefinitely, said Ed Hastey, state diector for the federal Bureau
of Land Management.
   ``More ravens kill tortoises than off-road vehicles,'' retorted
Ken Boyd, president of District 37 of the American Motorcycle
Association, which oversees the popular Barstow-to-Vegas run. ``But
you can't control ravens. It's easier to dictate to people.''
   The tortoise was added to the nation's endangered species list
as an emergency measure on Aug. 4. Its status will be reviewed next
April.
   ``We've been holding this race for 16 years and we've complied
with every regulation of federal, state, county and Indian tribe,''
said Deke Houlgate, a spokesman for SCORE.
   He said the organization will still stage the race but limit it
to Arizona.
   Jim Hayes, owner of a Yamaha-Suzuki dealership in Beaumont, said
he has ridden motorcycles in the California desert since 1949, and
believes many riders won't stop because of BLM rulings.
   ``There are so many people who really love this sort of thing,
and they are going to go out and do it anyway,'' he said.
   The Barstow-to-Las Vegas race was the most popular among
off-road enthusiasts and became the most bitterly fought of the
three. The race over the years has been battled in court by the
Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, and other groups that claim it
damaged the environment.
   The race, first run in 1967 with thousands of participants, was
put on hold by the BLM for seven years in 1975. It was reinstituted
under guidelines that limited participants to 1,200.
   In recent years, the Bartow-Las Vegas has ended at the Nevada
border, although the name remained. More than 1,100 participants
rode this year.
   Some runnings of the Thanksgiving race have seen such activist
groups as Earth First! claim responsibility for mismarking courses
and laying down tire spikes.
   BLM spokeswoman Barbara Maxfield said there were problems
despite controls, including route monitors, marked tortoise burrows
and having participants sign a statement of understanding about the
endangered status of the tortoises.
   ``We did find at least two burrows adjacent to the course that
were crushed,'' she said.
   Sierra Club observers claimed they also saw riders leaving
designated areas, and widening corridors that should have been
narrow passages.
   ``To this date, not one single tortoise has been injured or
killed,''Boyd insisted.
   But as an endangered species, the tortoise's delicate
environment also falls under protection.
   The tortoise's future became critical over the summer, when the
animals began dying of a mysterious respiratory ailment. Its
survival rate already is threatened by urban sprawl and traditional
enemies such as ravens that peck at its young.
   Motorcyclists say their way of life is being threatened, such as
communal gatherings of families at favorite spots for weekends.
   Ms. Maxfield pointed out Tuesday that about 100 desert races
were not affected by Monday's decision. Motorcyclists interviewed
said they believed it was only a matter of time.
   ``Don't close down the land,'' said Allen Barbor, 22, of
Palmdale. ``Most of it has been used for desert riding for
years.... You really can't get there by foot, so why not let
motorcyclists enjoy it?''
   The wear on terrain is precisely the problem, argued Sierra Club
official Elden Hughes.
   ``The desert is not there for everyone to destroy,'' he said.
   Steve Kassanyi, race director for SCORE International, sponsor
of the Parker 400, called the decision unfair and said it will be
challenged.
   The ruling is bad news for Barstow, 100 miles northeast of Los
Angeles.
   Attendance is an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 spectators for the
race, in addition to riders and support teams, boosting hotel
occupancy to 90 percent of the small desert city's 1,500 hotel
rooms.

   A giraffe barn on pop music
superstar Michael Jackson's ranch went up in flames, but the
animals were evacuated safely, authorities said.
   Firefighters on Tuesday also kept flames from reaching a nearby
animal compound and chimpanzee house at the ranch in the Santa Ynez
Mountains, northwest of Santa Barbara, officials said.
   When firefighters reached the remote ranch, the barn was
destroyed and the three giraffes kept there already were evacuated,
said Capt. Charlie Johnson, Santa Barbara County Fire Department
spokesman.
   Jackson, whose menagerie includes a chimpanzee named Bubbles,
ostriches, llamas and boa constrictors, was not at the ranch at the
time, said a spokesman for the singer.
   The blaze left an estimated $300,000 in damage.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, but it was
believed to have been accidentally ignited, Johnson said.

<HEAD>Increase in Winter Bonuses is Highest in Nine Years</HEAD>
<UNK>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with average monthly wages.</UNK>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of 291 major Japanese firms got winter
bonuses this month averaging $4,870, up 7.3 percent from last year
and the highest increase in nine years, the Japan Federation of
Employers' Associations said today.
   An association official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
attributed the increase to business prosperity in Japan.
   The official said winter bonuses rose by 21.3 percent from 1988
to an average of $4,350 for workers in the steel industry.
   In shipbuilding, bonuses rose by 15.1 percent to an average
$4,070 and in the mining industry they climbed 12.8 percent to
$4,310, he added.
   Meanwhile, employees of newspaper companies received winter
bonuses averaging $8,800, up 6.44 percent from a year earlier, the
official reported.
   Bonuses in the information and communications industry averaged
$5,550, up 5.5 percent, those in the food industry $5,470, up 3
percent, and those in the chemical industry $5,170, up 6.1 percent,
the official said.
   He said employees of the 291 major firms account for just 5
percent of Japan's 60 million-member labor force.
   Japanese companies ordinarily pay bonuses twice a year, in
summer and before the new year.
   The average monthly wage at the 291 firms was $1,690, the
official said.
   As of March 1989, the average monthly wage for newspapers was
$2,440, for information and communications $1,805, for the food
industry $1,790, and for the chemical industry $1,750.
   The average monthly wage for the steel industry was $1,740, for
shipbuilding $1,730 and for the mining industry $1,510.
   For all Japanese workers, as of March, the average wage was
$1,620 a month, not including bonuses and overtime, the Labor
Ministry said.

<HEAD>Canadian Destroyer Chases U.S. Scallop Fisherman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The high-seas chase of a scallop boat is the
latest episode in a maritime conflict between U.S. fishermen and
Canada that has been aggravated by a strike among the Canadian
crews who patrol the waters.
   The destroyer Saguenay fired on the Concordia during a 12-hour
chase off Cape Cod that began when Canadian authorities allegedly
spotted the boat poaching for scallops in Canadian waters.
   The accounts given Tuesday of the confrontation between Capt.
William Furey Jr.'s Concordia and the Saguenay varied widely. There
were no injuries and no charges were filed, though Canadian
officials said they were investigating.
   The episode appeared to be the most serious since 2,200 members
of the Canadian fishing patrol went on strike a month ago, leaving
their territorial waters vulnerable and posing what Canadian
authorities say is a temptation for American fishermen.
   The U.S. vessel was spotted five times during several days
poaching scallops 2.5 nautical miles over an international
fisheries line, said Carl Goodwin, chief of surveillance at the
Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The line was set by
the World Court at The Hague in 1984, after a long dispute between
the two countries.
   ``It is not our intent to harass American fishermen,'' Goodwin
said from his Halifax office. ``We're not just a bunch of cavalier
people who are running around firing at innocent American
fishermen.''
   The 366-foot Saguenay fired about 10 warning shots near the
114-foot Concordia during the chase. The two boats collided and
each skipper accused the other of ramming his boat.
   The Canadian destroyer pursued the Concordia from 130 miles off
Cape Cod through international waters until a Coast Guard cutter
picked the scalloper up early Tuesday at the American 12-mile
boundary and escorted it to New Bedford.
   Kenneth Crossman, a special agent with the U.S. National Marine
Fisheries Service, said officials boarded the scalloper in New
Bedford, near the scalloper's home port of Fairhaven, to confirm
the captain's identity and to examine the catch.
   Crossman said federal charges would be filed against the
Concordia only if solid evidence was presented by Canadian
officials.
   Furey said his charts never indicated he was in Canadian
territory. He also said he and his 10-member crew recharted their
course early Monday after a Canadian plane flew by and ordered them
not to move until a warship arrived.
   ``I wasn't going to stop the vessel and wait for a warship,'' he
said. ``I was fishing, not at war.''
   Furey, 31, said the destroyer eventually overtook his boat and,
when he refused to stop, rammed it three times.
   ``If we had been a wooden boat, we'd be cut in half,'' he said.
``The crew hit the deck. I shut off all the boat's lights and kept
weaving.''
   Naval vessels have been patrolling Canadian waters since crew
from the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans began a strike
for higher wages four weeks ago.
   Goodwin said the strike had paralyzed much of the government's
fishing patrol and left Canadian waters vulnerable to American
poachers, who he alleged have crossed the World Court line on
``almost a daily basis.''
   ``It's our firm belief that those fishermen know exactly where
the line is,'' Goodwin said. ``It has been there for quite a while
now and they've been given ample time to get the necessary charts
and chart their course properly out there.''

<HEAD>New York Federal Judge Calls for Legalizing Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The so-called war on drugs is a failure and
drugs from cocaine to heroin should be legalized, taxed and
dispensed by the state, a federal judge says.
   In his speech Tuesday evening at the Cosmopolitan Club, U.S.
District Judge Robert W. Sweet became the first federal judge to
propose publicly that illicit drugs be made legal, according to the
Drug Policy Foundation, a non-profit organization in Washington
that researches alternatives to current drug policy.
   ``I suggest it is time to abolish the prohibition _ to cease
treating indulgence in mind alteration as a crime,'' Sweet said.
   ``More money, more prisoners, more addicts _ these numbers
demonstrate to me our present prohibitive policy has failed, flatly
and without serious question.''
   Among the other prominent individuals favoring legalization are
former Secretary of State George Shultz, Baltimore Mayor Kurt
Schmoke, economist Milton Friedman and conservative columnist
William F. Buckley.
   Sweet said proverty caused the drug epidemic, and drug dealing
will continue to attract some poor people as long as potential
profits are high.
   ``Perhaps we must ask not what can we do to eliminate drugs, but
what can we do to eliminate or at least reduce the level of
poverty,'' he said.
   Sweet, a former New York deputy mayor and prosecutor, and a
trial judge in the Southern District of New York for more than 11
years, said the effort to stem the drug epidemic by jailing more
people is not working. He cited a declining commitment to jobs,
education, health and housing in the nation at a time when building
jails has become a growth industry.
   The enormous increase of criminal drug trials on the docket
forces long delays in civil matters. No juries were available in
Manhattan's federal court in September for civil trials, he said.
   Legalizing drugs would identify users, raise revenue for
prevention and rehabilitation, and eliminate gangs and drug
dealers, Sweet said.
   ``Obviously, the model is the repeal of Prohibition and the end
of Al Capone and Dutch Schultz.''
   Sweet said pharmaceutical companies could manufacture the drugs
and the state could distribute them to addicts for less than what
drug dealers charge, with tax revenue used for research, education
and treatment of addiction.
   Distribution to minors should remain prohibited, Sweet said.
   The Bush administration has said legalization would create an
``unqualified national disaster'' by creating many more addicts.
   On Tuesday, drug czar William Bennett compared legalization
supporters to advocates of slavery.
   ``This is not an economic issue. There were arguments made for
slavery based on economic considerations,'' Bennett said at a news
conference in New Hampshire.
   ``For someone to sit in a room and make an abstract bloodless
economic argument _ when we're looking at 200,000 cocaine babies a
year _ is to miss the point,'' he said.
   Bennett also said he approved of taking custody away from
addicted parents in extreme cases.
   ``Obviously, you give parents _ you give anybody _ the chance to
recover, to get better,'' Bennett said in an interview. ``But
supposing the parent isn't getting better, shows no interest in
improving, going into treatment, and it's adversely and
dramatically affecting the well-being of the child? The state can
intervene.''
   Bennett said most states already have legislation that provides
for taking children away from addicts who have proven unfit to
raise them.

<HEAD>In Critical Condition After Apparent Suicide Attempt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal authorities investigating
illegal bingo gambling and public corruption reportedly were
closing in on a top state official who was in critical condition
today after an apparent suicide attempt.
   The Nashville Banner quoted unidentified sources Tuesday as
saying investigators were focusing on how Secretary of State Gentry
Crowell solicited money for political campaigns from architects,
engineers and bingo operators.
   Crowell, 57, was found by his son, Brooks, on the porch of his
home in Lebanon, about 30 miles east of Nashville. Police said
Crowell apparently shot himself once in the mouth with a
.38-caliber revolver, which was found next to him.
   He left no note, and authorities would not say if they had any
leads as to his motive.
   Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents were investigating the
shooting to make sure no foul play was involved, said Deputy
Director John Carney.
   Doctors said Crowell's fate depended on how well he reacts to
swelling and infection in his brain.
   Neurosurgeons removed damaged brain tissue and a bullet from his
skull during more than four hours of surgery at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center. The gunshot wound caused ``a lot of
bleeding and it destroyed a lot of tissue,'' said John C. Ross, the
hospital's vice chancellor for health affairs.
   ``It's impossible to know at this time what residual damage
there might be,'' Ross said.
   ``The critical period now will be the next several days.''
   Crowell has not been implicated in any wrongdoing, though part
of the investigation has clouded his office.
   His former chief bingo inspector, W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker,
recently began a seven-year sentence at the federal prison in
Talladega, Ala. The charges included extorting payoffs from bingo
operators. And Crowell's former assistant, Mary Sue Wright,
resigned in August before giving testimony before the U.S. grand
jury in Memphis.
   She was named an unindicted co-conspirator in a Memphis bingo
operation and given immunity from prosecution. She has admitted
taking money from a Democratic legislative campaign fund,
authorities said.
   Bingo was outlawed in Tennessee this year after the state
Supreme Court ruled that the game is a lottery, in violation of the
state constitution.
   Previously, it had been legal for charity fund-raising, but
reports showed that bogus charities were set up and money skimmed
from some operations.
   Since January, 22 people have been indicted or pleaded guilty as
a result of the investigation. They include state Rep. Tommy
Burnett, charged with conspiracy, gambling, mail fraud and perjury.
Burnett has said he is innocent.
   Sen. Robert Rochelle, a Democrat from Crowell's hometown, called
Crowell a private person who didn't talk about his problems.
   But Rochelle pointed to the strain of news coverage in
connection with the federal investigation.
   ``I wish these prosecutors would quit letting people hang out
there to try to get them to talk if they don't have enough evidence
to convict them,'' he said.

<HEAD>Small Minnesota Town Knocks Down Ban on Soviet Vodka</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It wasn't as dramatic as knocking down
the Berlin Wall, but it was another sign of the thaw in East-West
relations. This small town has lifted its 6-year-old ban on Russian
vodka.
   ``It took six years, but the city of Hutchinson finally brought
the Soviet Union to its knees,'' joked Barry Anderson, the city
attorney.
   The sanction was removed Tuesday night through a unanimous voice
vote by the City Council.
   It had been issued to protest the 1983 downing of a South Korean
jetliner by a Soviet fighter pilot
   ``It's not a stunt. We take it seriously,'' insisted Councilman
Michael Carls, who is also a high school government teacher. ``It
was first outrage over their denial of life to those passengers on
the jet and today it's a feeling of pleasure over the extent of
democratization over there.''
   The council's discussion lasted five minutes and did not end
with a libation of vodka or any other beverage.
   Hutchinson's only retail liquor store is owned by the city.
Carls said other U.S. cities with municipal control over liquor
sales banned Soviet vodka after Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was
shot down, but he wasn't able to identify them.
   The plane was shot down in September 1983 on a flight from
Anchorage, Alaska, to Seoul after it strayed into Soviet airspace,
killing all 269 people aboard.
   Paul Ackland, mayor of this city of 10,000 residents, said the
Soviet Embassy in Washington would be informed that the vodka ban
has been lifted.
   ``We as a community support the changes being made and hope our
relationship continues to improve,'' he said.
   Jeanette Matheny, a clerk at Hutchinson Municipal Liquor Store,
said the ban stirred some discussion in 1983, but was quickly
forgotten.
   ``I don't even think most of the public was aware of the ban,''
she said.

<HEAD>Three Officials Killed in Colombia; Port City Chosen for Bush Summit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Suspected drug cartel assassins killed a
judge, a prosecutor and a bank official, part of a rise in
bloodshed as traffickers seek to stop the extraditions of narcotics
figures to the United States.
   The three slain late Tuesday night were the latest victims in
Colombia's 3-month-old war between drug smugglers and the
government, police said.
   The traffickers have said they would continue their campaign of
bombings and assassinations unless the voters are allowed to decide
whether to continue the policy of extraditing drug traffickers to
the United States.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco has said it will not
let up on its crackdown on Colombia's powerful cocaine cartels.
   Meanwhile, the Colombian city of Cartagena was chosen as the
site of a drug summit in February that is expected to be attended
by President Bush.
   Bernard Aronson, assistant U.S. secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, told a news conference in Bogota on Tuesday
that the U.S. government had accepted the Caribbean port city,
about 680 miles north of Bogota, as an acceptable site.
   Presidents Barco, Bush, Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and Alan
Garcia of Peru are to attend the summit. Colombia, Peru and Bolivia
all receive U.S. aid that is tied to the progress of their
anti-drug efforts.
   Ever since Barco declared an anti-narcotics war after a leading
presidential candidate was assassinated on Aug. 18, Colombia has
undergone a wave of killings, including a bombing last week that
claimed 63 lives.
   Officials also blame drug barons for the bombing of a Colombian
jetliner on a domestic flight Nov. 27 that killed all 107 people
aboard.
   Gabriel Jaime Velez, 38, a prosecutor who handled cases against
suspected drug traffickers, was one of the three people killed
Tuesday, police said Tuesday. He was killed in the town of
Envigado, six miles from Medellin, the home of the country's most
powerful cocaine cartel.
   Edgar Henao, 55, an engineer with the Inter-American Development
Bank, was killed in Venecia, 37 miles southeast of Medellin, police
said.
   Police said both men were killed by suspected assassins working
for drug traffickers.
   Judge Sofia de Roldaan also was killed by suspected cartel
assassins in the port of Buenaventura on Colombia's Pacific coast,
500 miles south of Medellin, police said.
   The authorities could not immediately provide details on how the
three officials were killed.
   Earlier this month, a proposed referendum on whether Colombians
accused of crimes in other countries should be extradited was
attached to legislation that would reform the constitution.
   The House of Representatives recently approved the legislation
with the extradition rider by a vote of 109-to-4, bringing on
accusations from the press that the congressmen had been bribed and
bullied by drug traffickers.
   On Tuesday, the legislation was in a Senate commitee, which was
reluctant to introduce it to the full Senate. If the legislation is
not approved by the Senate by Friday, when the Congress adjourns,
the bill would die.
   The 20 committee members were not discussing the bill, and no
one wanted to suggest it be voted on, the country's two leading
dailies, El Tiempo and El Espectador, reported.
   Publicly, the committee was acting as if the bill did not exist.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals panel ruled that Topeka is
not doing enough to desegregate its schools since the landmark
Brown vs. Board of Education case, but a dissenting judge cited
``substantial integration.''
   In the majority opinion, Judges Stephanie Seymour and Monroe
McKay overturned U.S. District Judge Richard Rogers' 1987 ruling
that Topeka schools were not responsible for lingering segregation
because the Board of Education did not intend to keep the schools
segregated.
   The three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Denver released the full decision on the reopened case Tuesday,
sending it back to Rogers.
   The original case led to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1954
that set a nationwide precedent for school desegregation and busing
cases. But the parents of black schoolchildren sued 10 years ago to
have the case reopened.
   The majority opinion, a reworked version of a 2-1 decision last
June, was accompanied by a new dissenting opinion.
   Today, lawyers for both sides expect to receive the latest
ruling.
   Seymour and McKay already had overruled Rogers in June, but
Judge Bobby Baldock didn't release his dissent then. The following
month, Seymour and McKay withdrew their decision without
explanation.
   Lawyers speculated that they wanted a chance to respond to
Baldock's dissent.
   In 1979, the parents of 17 black schoolchildren sued the
district to reopen the Brown case, contending that the district had
failed to eliminate all segregation.
   Among those parents was Linda Brown Buckner, who was a student
at the time of the 1954 decision and whose maiden name heads the
caption of the case.
   Rogers ruled in the reopened case that the school system had no
intention to maintain segregated schools.
   But Seymour wrote: Rogers ``erred by limiting the school
district's burden merely to showing that it had non-discriminatory
reasons for acting as it did. As 30 years of desegregation law have
made clear, the Constitution requires more than ceasing to promote
segregation.''
   Baldock argued the schools had done enough: ``The school board
has demonstrated concern for improving the racial composition in
the Topeka schools while retaining the neighborhood school concept.
   ``In some places the two are not compatible, but in this system
substantial integration has been achieved.''
   Rich Jones, an attorney for the parents who sought the case's
reopening, said lawyers will key on the dissenting opinion.
   ``This is the first time we get to see the dissent,'' he said.
``The school district will be in a position to make a decision.''
   The attorney for the school district, Joe Zima, said the board
plans to schedule a meeting early next week to consider it actions.
   Zima said the school district could ask all 10 judges on the
Court of Appeals to hear the case, ask the U.S. Supreme Court to
hear the case, or go before Rogers to help fashion a solution.

   About 400 policemen raided the home of
a controversial Moslem religious figure, touching off a gunbattle
with his followers in which at least 12 people were killed, police
said today.
   The police officers stormed the northern Bangladesh home of
Matiur Rahman on Tuesday to free a colleague abducted by Rahman's
supporters on Sunday while checking out reports the home was being
used as a sanctuary for criminals.
   Eight supporters of Rahman and four police officers were killed
in the clash in in Pakundia in Kishoreganj district, 50 miles north
of Dhaka, a local police officer said by telephone.
   The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Rahman's
supporters opened fired on the policemen when they went to free
their colleague.
   Bangladesh, a nation of 110 million people, has many so-called
Moslem saints like Rahman who claim they have extra ordinary
powers. Some exploit people. Moslems make up about 88 percent of
Bangladesh's 104 million people.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules Drug Testing of Postal Workers is Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service has violated job
applicants' constitutional rights by requiring them to undergo drug
tests without good reason, a federal judge has ruled.
   A postal union official said Tuesday the ruling would provide
ammunition in the fight against a Postal Service policy, instituted
this year, that screens prospective employees for past drug use.
   ``We read the decision as impacting the (Postal Service's)
current drug testing program,'' William Burrus, executive vice
president of the American Postal Workers Union, said from
Washington. ``We see it as extremely important. We hope to expand
its reach nationwide.''
   The case focused specifically on a research project begun in
1986 by the Postal Service, in which job applicants in Boston
submitted to drug tests, and the results were compared with the
employees' job performance after they were hired.
   In his ruling, U.S. District Judge John McNaught said the tests
violate constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and
seizures because the government has failed to show a compelling
reason for testing prospective employees.
   ``I conclude that the required urinalysis drug testing for all
job applicants to the United States Postal Service without
individualized suspicion is an unreasonable intrusion into the
privacy of applicants and thus, a violation of the Fourth
Amendment,'' McNaught said in his decision.
   James Lamond, the attorney representing the local American
Postal Workers Union in the case, said the decision marked the
first time a public sector drug-testing program for job applicants
had been struck down by a U.S. district judge.
   Gene Guerrero, who follows drug-testing issues for the American
Civil Liberties Union in Washington, said he was unaware of any
other rulings against government drug testing programs for job
applicants.
   Joel Prosch, assistant postmaster general for employee
relations, said no decision had been made whether to appeal the
judge's ruling. But he stressed that the case was limited to the
research project in Boston.
   According to court documents, job applicants were required to
submit to a urinalysis for drug testing starting in September 1986.
   ``It was done purely for research purposes,'' said Karen
Intrater, an attorney for the Postal Service. ``It had nothing to
do with the hiring process.''
   If the tests results were positive, the applicants could still
be hired, and they would be monitored for absenteeism, discipline
problems and other factors.
   The data collection in the study ended earlier this year, but
the results have not yet been published, Intrater said.
   The program was challenged by the local postal carriers union.
McNaught issued his ruling Nov. 21, but the decision was just made
public this week.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Drop Charges Against Hazelwood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood
did not qualify for immunity from prosecution by reporting his
ship's grounding and oil spill and must stand trial on criminal
charges, a judge ruled.
   Superior Judge Karl Johnstone said Tuesday that all evidence
gathered in the investigation except for Hazelwood's report will be
admissible at his trial for the March 24 grounding of the tanker
and the spill of about 11 million gallons of crude oil.
   Hazelwood is to go on trial Jan. 22 for his role in the nation's
largest oil spill.
   He is charged with three felony counts of criminal mischief,
plus misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, negligent
discharge of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated.
   Johnstone rejected arguments by Hazelwood's attorneys that the
seaman, fired by Exxon right after the disaster, was immune from
prosecution because of laws protecting people who report spills.
   The judge, who heard two weeks of testimony, determined that the
Coast Guard's discovery of the spill would have been delayed only
17 minutes without Hazelwood's report. Johnstone based that
conclusion on the testimony of a Coast Guard radar traffic monitor.
   Even without Hazelwood's report, the Coast Guard would have
conducted substantially the same investigation that ensued,
Johnstone said. Investigators would have arrived at the tanker at
about the same time, no matter what the source of the report, he
said.
   Johnstone's ruling appeared to be almost a total victory for
prosecutors, who argued that the intent of the immunity provisions
was not to protect spillers for incidents that would be discovered
anyway.
   Defense lawyer Richard Friedman said he already is working on an
appeal of Johnstone's decision.
   If convicted on all counts, Hazelwood faces a maximum sentence
of 11{ years in prison and $106,000 in fines. He is the only person
the state has charged in the oil spill.

<HEAD>Ex-Bolivian Minister Held Without Bond on Trafficking Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bolivian colonel who allegedly protected cocaine
smugglers and organized death squads with the ``Butcher of Lyon''
is being held without bond after being flown to the United States
on drug trafficking charges.
   A formal bond hearing will be held Dec. 26 for Luis Arce Gomez,
who faces up to 30 years in prison on a 1983 cocaine indictment,
U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff said Tuesday.
   Arce Gomez was detained at his ranch near La Paz, Bolivia, on
Sunday and spirited out of his native country on a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration plane.
   ``Bringing (Arce Gomez) to trial is a significant strike against
the danger posed to the United States by those who deal in
narcotics,'' Diane Cossin, executive assistant to U.S. Attorney
Dexter Lehtinen, said after the hearing.
   Arce Gomez was Bolivia's interior minister from July 1980 to
March 1981 under a military dictatorship supported by the country's
major drug traffickers. He was known as the ``minister of cocaine.''
   He and top aides are accused of setting up a protection racket
that charged drug traffickers as much as $75,000 every two weeks to
look the other way and let cocaine traffic continue.
   In addition, human rights groups have accused Arce Gomez of
running death squads that hunted down, tortured and killed hundreds
of enemies of the military government he served.
   Arce Gomez reportedly ran the death squads with help from
then-fugitive Nazi official Klaus Barbie, the ``Butcher of Lyon''
who later was captured and extradited to France and is now serving
a life term for ``crimes against humanity.''
   In March 1981 Arce Gomez was forced out of office. He fled to
Argentina in 1982 when civilian rule returned to Bolivia, was
arrested in Argentina after the 1983 indictment but later was
released on a technicality.
   At his hearing Tuesday he wore a T-shirt, slacks and sandals,
and said only ``I understand,'' as he was read a summary of the
charges.
   He was being represented by Jose Quinon, one of the attorneys
who represented Colombian drug kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas,
sentenced last year in Jacksonville to life in prison.
   President Bush has applauded Bolivia's role in Arce Gomez'
capture, a sentiment echoed by federal law enforcement officials
here.
   ``It sends a message that they're willing to go after the
highest-level traffickers and send them here for trial,'' said
Richard Gregorie, the former top drug prosecutor in the U.S.
attorney's office in Miami.

<HEAD>Comaneci Denies Romance With Married Roofer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Olympic gold medalist Nadia
Comaneci says she has a business relationship with the married
father of four who helped her escape from Romania, not a romantic
one.
   ``He's not my lover boy, he's my manager,'' she told the
Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale during a telephone interview
Tuesday.
   The 28-year-old gold medalist, who has shared a hotel room with
Constantin Panait for the past week, added: ``It is all a big lie
and you are very bad. ... (Panait) is just trying to help me. We
are not lovers. Ask Constantin. He will tell you.''
   Panait, 36, also spoke from the couple's room.
   ``There is no romance,'' he said. ``I am just her manager, only
that. I am trying to help her make movies and commercials, and
maybe get a book of her life. That's all.''
   He and Comaneci arrived in New York City two weeks ago after the
28-year-old gymnast left her homeland with six others Nov. 28.
   At a news conference last week, Comaneci and Panait told
reporters they would live together in south Florida. When asked
about a romance, Comaneci blushed. And when a reporter wondered if
she knew Panait is married and a father, she answered: ``So what?''
   That remark cast Comaneci in an unfavorable light with much of
the public and with some national advertisers, and has been
highlighted repeatedly by the media.
   Comaneci and Panait have stayed at a Pompano Beach hotel since
Dec. 5. Panait, a Hallandale roofer, has not returned to the home
he shared with his wife, Maria, 25, and their children, ages 2 to 6.
   ``I don't know when I will go back home,'' he said Tuesday.
``But Maria knows all of this. I have called her to explain
everything. This is all not true about a romance.''
   Maria Panait, who has not seen her husband since Nov. 2, seemed
surprised and relieved.
   ``Really? That's good news,'' she said. ``It sure makes me feel
a lot better. But, I will believe this about him being her manager
when I hear it from him face-to-face when he comes home.''

   Crooner Bing Crosby's son Lindsay was
battling alcoholism and depression when he found out his
inheritance had run out, and that pushed him over the edge to
suicide, a family spokeswoman said.
   His body, bearing a gunshot wound to the head, was found Monday
at his condominium in Calabasas where he was being treated for his
drinking problem, said Marilyn Reiss.
   An autopsy to officially determine the cause of death was
scheduled for today, said Bob Dambacher, spokesman for the Los
Angeles County coroner.
   Lindsay, 51, was the youngest of four sons born to Crosby, the
legendary singer of ``White Christmas,'' and Dixie Lee Crosby.
   The elder Crosby, who also starred with Bob Hope in a series of
popular ``Road'' pictures, died of a heart attack at age 73 in
1977. Mrs. Crosby died of cancer in 1952.
   Bing Crosby married actress Kathryn Grant in 1957 and they had
two boys and a girl.
   Ms. Reiss, a longtime friend and publicist for Lindsay's brother
Gary Crosby, said the Crosby brothers were informed on Nov. 30 that
their inheritance wasn't making money anymore. It was planned by
their mother 45 years ago and was based on investments in crude oil.
   The inheritance provided a regular income for the brothers,
including twins Dennis and Phillip.
   ``It was not humongous but it certainly allowed all four boys to
live comfortably,'' Ms. Reiss said.
   ``Gary said to me that Lindsay's problem is that he is too good
and that he is a sweet, kind, gentle guy, and maybe he should have
been meaner because maybe he could have taken this blow,'' Ms.
Reiss said.
   Lindsay Crosby was married three times. His first marriage was
to dancer Barbara Frederickson. He also wed secretary Janey
Schwartz before marrying former Miss Alaska Susan Marlin.
   His famous father was long known as one of America's pre-eminent
family men, but Gary Crosby's 1983 book, ``Going My Own Way,''
portrayed the elder Crosby as a less-than-perfect parent who was a
stern disciplinarian.
   Lindsay Crosby supported his brother at the time of its
publication but had a tempered view of its revelations.
   ``I never expected affection from my father so it didn't bother
me,'' he once told an interviewer.

   Relatives of some of 248 U.S. soldiers killed
in an airliner crash in Newfoundland four years ago are joining
with Congress members and Canadian investigators in urging a U.S.
inquiry into the disaster.
   ``Something is obviously wrong and has been obviously wrong for
the last four years,'' Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., said at a news
conference following ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery
marking the crash anniversary.
   Tallon, victims' relatives and two Canadian Aviation Safety
Board members who disagreed with a majority conclusion on the crash
said they see a U.S. and Canadian government coverup in the
three-year investigation that concluded the chartered DC-8 Arrow
Air jetliner was downed by ice on the wings as it took off from
Gander, Newfoundland.
   A board minority report said there was evidence of a fire and
explosion, possibly from a terrorist bomb, before the Dec. 12,
1985, crash which killed the soldiers and eight American crew
members.
   A Canadian judge earlier this year disagreed with both the board
majority and minority conclusions but said the inquiry into
Canada's worst aviation disaster should not be reopened because
there wasn't enough evidence left to determine the cause.
   Tallon is trying to get President Bush and a congressional
committee to open inquiries into the crash, which has never been
the subject of a formal U.S. investigation.
   Tallon said he has been lied to about the crash by the FBI and
the Defense Department, which participated in the Canadian
investigation but issued no conclusions of their own.
   ``The FBI said there was no investigation, then they found a
277-page report,'' he said. ``The Defense Department said there was
no cargo manifest, then all of the sudden there was one.''
   ``There is circumstantial evidence of a coverup,'' Tallon said.
He said Canadian authorities appear to have gone along with U.S.
Defense Department decisions on what was in ``the national
interest.''
   Tallon said he was not prepared to say that terrorists were
involved but noted that the soldiers had been on a mission to the
Middle East, that a pro-Iranian group claimed credit for the crash
and that it came at a time when it was later determined that the
United States was involved in the Iran-Contra affair, trying to
exchange arms for U.S. hostages in Lebanon
   Dr. Doug Phillips of St. Petersburg, Fla., said his organization
of victims' families has grown from six members at the first of the
year to 130 with renewed interest in the crash.
   Phillips, a pathologist, said examination of the bodies,
including that of his son, Sgt. James D. Phillips, shows evidence
of a fire prior to the crash.
   He said family members have written to Bush complaining about
the lack of a U.S. investigation but he said none has received a
reply.
   In October, 103 members of Congress signed a letter to Bush
calling for a presidential inquiry, saying the United States has an
``obligation to finish the investigation that was inadequately
conducted by the Canadian government.'' Tallon invited Bush to the
memorial service, but the president did not attend.
   Les Filotas and Ross Stephenson, members of the Canadian
investigative board, told the news conference they believed an
explosion caused the crash _ either from a bomb or explosive
souvenirs in the cargo area. Filotas said U.S. soldiers have been
known in other instances to smuggle aboard in their luggage
weaponry that is not allowed on airliners.
   The Air Line Pilots Association concluded in June, after its own
inquiry, that the Canadian investigators relied on fabricated and
erroneous evidence in reaching their conclusion that the crash was
caused by wing ice.

   A former army commando who
says he was assigned to spy on anti-apartheid activists in the
Netherlands has been arrested for desertion, military headquarters
said today.
   The arrest came five days after an anti-apartheid newspaper,
Free Weekly, published an interview in which the former soldier,
Robert Carelse, made detailed claims about his activities in the
Netherlands.
   Carelse said he was instructed by the Military Intelligence
branch to live in Amsterdam and infiltrate militant anti-apartheid
groups, including the African National Congress guerrilla movement
and the Committee of South African War Resisters. The Netherlands
has very active anti-apartheid groups, including the main office of
the War Resisters.
   Carelse said he went to the Netherlands in July 1988 and
returned to South Africa in March. While in Amsterdam, Carelse
reportedly stayed with his brother-in-law, Keith Raper, a leader of
the draft resisters' committeee.
   At the time of his arrest, Carelse was enrolled at a technical
college in Johanneburg.
   The army statement said only that Carelse had been arrested as a
deserter. There has been no official comment on Carelse's
allegations.
   Security officials often boast that they have infilitrated the
ANC in neighboring African countries and elsewhere in the world.
The ANC has offices in about 30 countries, more places than South
Africa has embassies worldwide.
   Police are investigating the possibility that some members of
the Military Intelligence branch may have had direct or indirect
links with death squads alleged to have killed anti-apartheid
activists in South Africa over the past 10 years.

<TEXT>
   A reporter who has criticized the Arizona
attorney general's investigation of the 1976 car-bomb murder of
journalist Don Bolles has been slapped with a grand jury subpoena
in an attempt to intimidate him, his lawyer says.
   ``We'll move to quash or limit the subpoena,'' David Bodney, a
lawyer for reporter Don Devereux, said Tuesday.
   Devereux was served with a state grand jury subpoena last week
by aides to Attorney General Bob Corbin. The subpoena came days
after Devereux had published new criticisms of Corbin's efforts to
find Bolles' killers.
   The attorney general and Devereux declined comment, citing a
state law that makes it a crime to disclose grand jury matters.
   But Bodney confirmed that his client had been subpoenaed and
added, ``It is Devereux's judgment that it is harassment and
designed to intimidate.''
   Bolles, a reporter for The Arizona Republic, died 11 days after
a remote-controlled bomb blew up his car 13 years ago.
   Devereux, a freelance reporter, has published stories in The
Scottsdale Progress and in a private newsletter pointing to areas
that he says Corbin's office has failed to pursue.
   The state grand jury does not have jurisdiction over the killing
but has been investigating conspiracy and obstruction of justice
allegations, according to documents made available to The
Associated Press in October.
   Bodney said the subpoena did not ask Devereux to bring any
documents or specify whether he was a potential target or what the
grand jury wants to know.
   ``I think it's improper for the attorney general to conduct a
freewheeling examination of a reporter that will inhibit his
newsgathering ability perhaps for all time,'' the lawyer said.
   In addition to the state and federal constitution's free-press
guarantees, Arizona's shield law protects reporters from having to
disclose their sources, he said.
   ``Let the grand jury call witnesses with first-hand information
and not interrogate reporters about their sources,'' Bodney said.
   Corbin, a Republican, has come under increasing fire over the
unsolved slaying. He has not announced whether he will seek
re-election next year.
   He recently asked a judge to reinstate a murder charge against
one of the original suspects in a move that Devereux had
criticized, days before being subpoenaed, as likely to be
unproductive and a possible case of playing politics.
   Among those known to have been subpoenaed is Neal Roberts, a
Phoenix lawyer who has acknowledged that he arranged for John
Harvey Adamson to travel to Lake Havasu City hours after the
bombing. Adamson, a racing-dog breeder, was convicted of planting
the bomb. No mastermind was ever convicted, and investigators have
not established the motive with any certainty.

<TEXT>
   An outbreak of snowball and ice throwing
during a Philadelphia Eagles game has prompted a ban on beer in the
stands for the rest of the season, but alcohol will be allowed in
the stadium's luxury boxes.
   ``It may be discriminatory, but it's legal,'' City Solicitor
Seymour Kurland said Tuesday. The luxury boxes held by corporate
bigwigs and other VIPs ``don't pose the same safety issue that is
posed by the people in the stands,'' he said.
   The outburst _ witnessed by a CBS TV audience Sunday in parts of
the country _ resulted in at least six arrests and the ejection of
200 fans.
   The ban was agreed to by the Philadelphia Eagles, the city and a
vending company at city-owned Veterans Stadium and applies to the
football team's remaining regular-season home game and any playoff
games this year.
   It remains to be decided whether the ban will continue next year
as well.
   The weekend outburst during a game against the Dallas Cowboys
embarrassed city and team officials. Snow and ice hit members of
the Cowboys, Eagles cheerleaders and fans in the line of fire. A
few people were slightly hurt.
   The Eagles and the city had asked Ogden-Allied Services Corp., a
stadium concession, to stop beer sales because they believed
alcohol helped cause the outburst.
   ``It was something that needed to be done,'' said Bruce Ground,
general manager for Ogden-Allied.
   The Eagles also banned alcohol at tailgate parties outside the
stadium. Until now, beer had been sold in the first half of games
and drinking had been tolerated at one parking lot.
   The Eagles have one regular-season home game remaining, Dec. 24
against the Phoenix Cardinals, but are in position to make the
playoffs.
   Ogden-Allied also handles the food concessions at the New
Orleans Superdome, the Seattle Kingdome and Rich Stadium in Orchard
Park, N.Y., where Ogden discontinued the sale of alcohol on Monday
nights because of fan misbehavior.

return to Vietnam all those who are judged not to be refugees,''
Chief Secretary Sir David Ford told the Legislative Council. His
speech did not include a timetable for further repatriation.
   The approximately 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into Hong
Kong since June 1988 are considered illegal ``economic'' immigrants
unless they can prove the fled their Communist homeland fearing
persecution.
   Nearly 6,800 have been denied refugee status after being
screened by immigration officials. A few more than 700 have
qualified.
   The first batch to be sent home against their will were whisked
screaming and crying from their detention center by riot police
before dawn Tuesday and put on a plane to Hanoi.
   Vietnam has promised the returnees will be treated humanely.
   The Hanoi government said today that the boat people fled their
homeland because embargoes by non-Communist nations had created
economic problems in Vietnam and because the refugees had received
false hopes of better economic opportunity in Hong Kong. Vietnam
condemned the forced repatriation.
   The demonstrations today were ``peaceful and orderly'' as
Vietnamese marched around the camps chanting slogans and waving
banners protesting involuntary repatriation, said government
spokesman Lionel Rodrigues.
   Local radio quoted some protesters as saying they would rather
die in Hong Kong than be forced back home.
   About 3,000 boat people marched in Hei Ling Chau detention
center, a former leper colony on an outlying island, and another
3,000 protested at Whitehead camp in the New Territories. About 300
more demonstrated at Chi Ma Wan center on outlying Lantau Island.
   The longest demonstration lasted two hours and all were over by
evening, Rodrigues said. ``Basically, it wasn't very unruly. They
just marched around the compound,'' he said.
   The Hong Kong government argues that sending the Vietnamese back
home is more humane than keeping them indefinitely in the camps,
which are overcrowded and rife with violence and malnutrition.
   But human rights organizations, British opposition politicians
and the U.S. government have criticized the program. The U.S. State
Department expressed deep regret over the repatriations and said
``British authorities should continue to grant asylum to all those
persons from Vietnam who seek it.''
   Ford responded to critics by saying that ``those who have been
loudest in their condemnation have been slowest in bringing forward
practical alternatives. We have returned no one who in the eyes of
the international community is a bonafide refugee.''
   He added: ``We do not look for the world's applause, but we are
entitled, I feel, to the world's understanding.''
   Hong Kong and Britain maintain that the territory already is
swamped with Vietnamese boat people and mandatory repatriation is
needed to discourage another influx when the new sailing season
begins next year.
   They claim that most Vietnamese now sailing into Hong Kong are
not escaping persecution but only seeking a better life.
   About 56,000 Vietnamese are housed in the colony's squalid
camps. Those who arrived before June 1988 automatically were
granted refugee status and are eligible for resettlement.

   The new opposition-dominated
government today said it is drafting laws guaranteeing free
assembly and association and freedom of religion, while Communists
lawmakers debated how to pick a new president.
   The proposed reforms were announced by Deputy Premier Jan
Carnogursky, a dissident lawyer who was released from jail just two
weeks ago and on Sunday was named to the first government in 41
years led by non-Communists.
   The changes in the penal code would strengthen the independence
of the judiciary and reduce the time a person can be held in
custody before charges are filed, Carnogursky said.
   The presidential tussle is the latest battle for a popular
opposition movement that in three weeks got the Communists to oust
old Stalinist hard-liners and relinquish the party's 41-year
monopoly on power.
   Under the constitution, Parliament must elect a president in 14
days. That would be Dec. 23, two weeks after hard-liner Gustav
Husak was forced to resign to satisfy the opposition.
   Some Communist lawmakers want the choice to be made by public
referendum. But the opposition, hoping to keep its momentum while
it can, is pressing for a quicker decision.
   Vasil Mohorita, a member of the Communist Politburo, said
opposition leaders agreed during negotiations Tuesday that 14 days
isn't enough time to choose a president.
   Many opposition figures favor Vaclav Havel, a playwright and
oft-jailed dissident who is the emotional rallying point of the
reform movement.
   After discussions by constitutional lawyers from all parties on
Tuesday, Mohorita said it might take from 45 days to 60 days for an
election to be held, whether in Parliament or by a vote of the
people.
   Mohorita is a senior Communist who negotiated with the
opposition the coalition government chosen last week. The Cabinet
was the first to make Communists a minority in the government in
four decades.
   Mohorita conceded that Havel ``represents something and in no
way can we underestimate his position in society.''
   ``What we are trying to find is the least complicated
agreement,'' he said. He said the Communists were aware that ``If
Mr. Havel was not elected by Parliament, that would also create
tensions. That's why we're in negotations.''
   But Havel, who was being denounced as an isolated,
anti-Socialist dissident only a month ago, is apparently difficult
for many Communists to accept as president.
   Central Prague is plastered with posters pushing Havel's
candidacy, and about 500 demonstrators stood outside Parliament
shouting support for him Tuesday as deputies entered the Parliament
building.
   Mohorita said the Communists sought the quick solution to the
impasse because ``we are more or less facing a constitutional
crisis,'' a reference to the 14-day deadline the constitution
mandates.
   Deputy Anton Blazej, speaking on behalf of the Communist
deputies who dominate the 350-member parliament, proposed amending
the constitution to allow for a presidential referendum within a
month. It failed to pass.
   Civic Forum, the opposition movement Havel has guided through
the past three weeks of crisis, strongly rejects a referendum.
   It said that although the idea seemed ``enticingly democratic,''
it in fact would mean swiftly amending a constitution for the
second time in less than three weeks, and could lead to a
presidential campaign leaving the country ``more divided than
united.''
   The government instead should press ahead with free elections,
the group said in a statement. Then, a new, freely elected
Parliament would choose a new president.
   ``We are not concerned with whether Havel would have a better
chance'' in Parliament than in a referendum, said Civic Forum
spokesman Lubos Dobrovsky. ``We are concerned with democracy having
a better chance.''
   Last week, Civic Forum indicated there was virtual agreement
with the Communists that the president should be a Czech and
non-party member, balancing the Communist premier, Marian Calfa, a
Slovak.
   Traditionally, top posts in Czechoslovakia have been divided
between Czechs and Slovaks.
   Alexander Dubcek, 68, the leader of the 1968 ``Prague Spring''
reforms that were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion, also is a
candidate for president.
   Others are Ladislav Adamec, who resigned as Communist premier
last week after failing to reach an agreement with the opposition;
and Cestmir Cisar, a ``Prague Spring'' leader who like Dubcek was
expelled from the Communist Party in 1970 but has retained many
Socialist ideals.
   Husak, 76, resigned Sunday after swearing in a government
containing some dissidents who were jailed because of his policies
after the 1968 invasion.
   Other hard-liners lost their last leadership positions Tuesday,
when they resigned from the presidium that guides the Parliament.
   The 15 deputies who stepped down included ousted Communist party
chief Milos Jakes, who last week also was expelled from party
ranks; and Vasil Bilak, the Communist held most responsible for the
1968 invasion.

   Vietnam said today that embargoes by
non-Communist nations helped create the economic problems that
caused many of its citizens to flee to other countries in search of
better economic opportunity.
   The commentary by the official Vietnam News Agency also
reiterated the government's condemnation of Hong Kong's forcible
repatriation on Tuesday of more than 50 Vietnamese refugees.
   ``The policies of hostility and economic sanctions ... by some
countries against Vietnam over the past 10 years is one of the
reasons causing economic difficulties in Vietnam. This led to the
fact that some people fled the country,'' said the commentary
carried by the Voice of Vietnam radio and monitored in Bangkok.
   ``Vietnam cannot ignore its compatriots who nurtured the
illusion of looking for a paradise in other countries and have been
detained in camps for years,'' it said.
   Hong Kong and its colonial ruler, Britain, flew back home 51
Vietnamese from a Hong Kong camp Tuesday in the first forced
repatriation.
   Hong Kong considers 44,000 Vietnamese who poured into the
territory since June 1988 to be illegal immigrants seeking jobs,
not political refugees from Vietnam's Communist regime.
   ``Vietnam always welcomes those who are willing to repatriate
and at the same time rejects forced repatriation,'' the commentary
said. ``The repatriation from Hong Kong, including those who
returned on Dec. 12, 1989, are part of the framework of that
policy.''
   Vietnam has been largely isolated from the non-Communist world
since North Vietnam overthrew the U.S.-backed South Vietnam
government in April 1975, triggering the boat exodus.
   Most non-Communist countries, including Japan and the United
States, imposed or continued embargoes on Vietnam after its troops
invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and installed a pro-Vietnamese
government.

   Jailed black nationalist
leader Nelson Mandela, whose release is expected within weeks, met
today with President F.W. de Klerk about the prospects for
black-white political negotiations.
   The meeting, announced by the Justice Ministry, was Mandela's
second with a South African president this year. He met with
President P.W. Botha on July 5, also at Tuynhuis, the presidential
office in Cape Town.
   The Justice Ministry said Mandela had requested the meeting and
that de Klerk ``welcomed the opportunity.'' It said further talks
were expected next year.
   The meeting ``fitted in with Mr. de Klerk's program to consult
with the full spectrum of political opinion concerning the mutual
future of all South Africans,'' the statement said.
   Mandela, leader of the outlawed African National Congress and
the country's best-known black leader, has been imprisoned since
1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the white-led government.
   The far-right Conservative Party, which won 31 percent of the
white vote in September's parliamentary elections, said today's
meeting represented a de facto legalization of the ANC.
   The Conservative's leader, Andries Treurnicht, condemned de
Klerk for meeting the leader of ``a banned terrorist organization''
and suggested he had underestimated whites' desire to retain full
political sovereignty.
   De Klerk, who took office in August, says he wants to end racial
discrimination and extend political rights to South Africa's 28
million blacks within five years.
   However, he opposes black majority rule and a one-man, one-vote
system. He envisions some type of mechanism that will give whites
veto power on major policy decisions.
   At today's meeting, de Klerk and Mandela discussed ``ways and
means to address current obstacles in the way of meaningful
dialogue,'' the Justice Ministry statement said. ``Follow-up talks
in the new year are envisaged.''
   The ministry said no further details about the substance of the
talks would be released.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee and Constitutional Development
Minister Gerrit Viljoen attended the meeting, the statement added.
   All prominent black leaders, even conservative ones, say
Mandela's release is a precondition for negotiations with the
government. Most black leaders also demand the release of other
security prisoners and the lifting of the 3{-year-old state of
emergency before any talks begin.
   Mandela, 71, is not likely to be released this year, but
government sources have been quoted as saying he probably will be
freed before Parliament convenes in early February.
   De Klerk, since succeeding Botha, has ushered in several reforms
that have eased political tension.
   He has permitted huge anti-apartheid demonstrations, ordered
desgregation of whites-only beaches, and proposed the repeal of the
Separate Amenities Act, which permits the segregation of many
public facilities.
   Seven of Mandela's ANC colleagues were freed Oct. 15 in what was
seen as a trial run for Mandela's release. There has been no
upsurge in unrest related to their release and frequent appearances
at anti-government meetings.
   Mandela is held in a suburban-style staff residence at Victor
Verster prison farm outside Cape Town and has been meeting
regularly with a wide range of anti-apartheid activists.
   Mandela met Tuesday for two hours with Walter Sisulu, one of the
ANC leaders freed two months ago.
   The ANC, based in Lusaka, Zambia, wages a bombing and sabotage
campaign in its bid to undermine the government. However, the armed
struggle has been largely dormant in recent months.

   The Communist Party today reaffirmed its
commitment to traditional socialism and said it will still espouse
the principles of Lenin even as East Germany ends one-party rule
and embraces democracy.
   An article in the party daily Neues Deutschland said the
Communists also will continue to resist reunification with West
Germany.
   In the detailed proposal for restructuring the party, the
Communists called for a course that adheres to ``socialist,
anti-fascist, pacifist and all international leftist traditions,
especially those of Lenin.''
   The proposal is to be considered at the continuation this
weekend of the party's special congress. The session began Friday
but suspended its work after naming a new party leader, reformer
Gregor Gysi.
   Despite the reaffirmation of socialism, the party leadership has
been overhauled to remove hard-liners and install reformers in an
effort to appease the restive populace, which is demanding
democratic change and has thrown its support to the opposition.
   The party will have to compete for power against a powerful
opposition movement in May, when East Germany holds what are to be
its first free and open elections. The vote is set for May6.
   Also today, the East German government expanded its cooperation
with West Germany with an agreement under which Bonn will
contribute about $540 million for 17 environmental improvement
projects in East Germany.
   The agreement was announced in Bonn by West German Environmental
Minister Klaus Toepfer.
   East German cities also have been appealing for food aid, for
help in preparing free elections and for advice on a range of
reforms that have drastically changed municipal operations.
   At a conference in Cologne, West German municipal authorities
reported that they had been overwhelmed with calls for assistance
from their East German sister cities.
   West Germany has offered massive aid to East Germany on
condition some capitalist reforms are undertaken. But the
Communist-led government has agreed to discuss only those
cooperative ventures that fit into the socialist structure of the
economy.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow and other top officials also have
repeatedly rejected West German efforts to merge the German states,
though they have expressed interest in closer ties that benefit
both sides.
   Meanwhile, the opposition group New Forum has filed a criminal
complaint against former Communist leader Egon Krenz and the head
of the secret police force for allegedly destroying evidence needed
in probes of corruption among ousted high party officials.
   The official ADN news agency reported the accusations made
against Krenz and Wolfgang Schwanitz. The decision to seek charges
against the two was made at a New Forum meeting in Leipzig.
   On Tuesday, Modrow met with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, who expressed U.S. support for the democratic reforms
introduced in East Germany.
   Under the rule of ousted leader Erich Honecker, relations
between the United States and East Germany often were tense,
largely because of the Berlin Wall and other barriers to free
movement that were enforced with shoot-to-kill orders.
   Baker's meeting with Modrow was held in Potsdam, where Britain,
the United States and the Soviet Union mapped out Germany's future
in 1945 after the defeat of Nazi Germany.
   More than four decades later, East Germany is undergoing its
biggest upheaval since its founding in 1949. Two sets of Communist
leaders have been ousted since Oct. 18.
   But the growing demands for German reunification have threatened
to split the opposition movement.
   The Communists are fighting for their political lives just two
months after their iron-fisted rule began crumbling. Still, the
Communists control most of the top posts, and one of the major
opposition forces is urging Modrow's government to resign before
Christmas.
   After meeting with Modrow for an hour, Baker said it was
important that reforms in East Germany move forward ``peacefully
and in a stable way'' and that this was the major ``political
signal'' of his visit.
   He spoke outside the Potsdam Hotel after becoming the
highest-ranking U.S. official to visit East Germany in nearly two
decades. The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1974.
   Baker said he told Modrow the United States was pleased that the
Communists and the opposition had agreed on May 6 as the date for
free elections.
   Modrow, 61, said East Germany saw Baker's visit ``without a
doubt'' as support for the process of reforms.
   ``This visit is a political sign that the U.S. follows the
developments in (East Germany) with attention,'' Modrow said. ``We
started a dialogue with each other today.''
   Modrow said his government believed ``this dialogue would lead
to cooperation.''
   Later, Modrow met with U.S. House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri, Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., and Sen. Robert
Kerrey, D-Neb., according to the official East German news agency
ADN.

<HEAD>Army General Denies Poison Gas Used in Georgia Demonstration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The army officer in charge of the military
investigation into the deaths of 20 Georgian nationalists in April
has denied that troops used nerve gas to break up a rally, a
newspaper reported today.
   Maj. Gen. V. Vasiliev defended the soldiers' actions and said
they were provoked by nationalists who pelted them with bottles and
stones on April 9 when thousands gathered in the main square of
Tbilisi, the republic's capital.
   Nineteen people died and at least 300 people were hospitalized
when soldiers, many armed with shovels, waded into the crowd to
break up the demonstration. Another nationalist was fatally shot
the night before for a curfew violation.
   A civilian commission and Communist Party officials said two
weeks later that an investigation showed that soldiers had used a
poisonous, incapacitating gas to disperse the rally.
   Vasiliev told the daily Sovietskaya Rossia, ``no poisonous gases
were used, only special tear gas, substances similar to those used
by police in the West.''
   He said his investigation showed that 272 names of alleged
victims of poison gas released by nationalists were false and many
names were repeated ``time and time again.''
   Vasiliev said soldiers acted in self-defense when they attacked
some demonstrators with shovels, but that none of the victims had
died as a result of the attack.
   ``The majority of the people were killed in the mass commotion
when people were horribly pressed together,'' he said.
   Following the fatal rally, Georgian Communist Party chief Givi
Gumbaridze told reporters that some of the victims had died from
gas poisoning.
   A full report on the incident was expected to made to the
Congress of People's Deputies during its current session in Moscow.

<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani
says the latest Central American accord strips the leftist rebels
of any legitimacy and if they don't disband ``the army will deal
with them.''
   The five Central American presidents on Tuesday demanded the
dismantling of both the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front in El Salvador and the U.S.-backed Contras fighting in
Nicaragua.
   The two-day summit in San Jose, Costa Rica, was the latest in a
series that have raised hopes but failed to bring peace to Central
America. It was the first to focus on El Salvador, and it renewed a
call earlier this year for the dissolution of the Contras.
   The joint condemnation of both insurgencies was viewed as a
victory for rightist Cristiani as well as Nicaragua's leftist
President Daniel Ortega, but it was also clouded by skepticism and
suspicion.
   ``I do not trust Daniel Ortega,'' said Cristiani.
   Neither of the rebel armies was represented at the summit and
neither has agreed to be disbanded.
   ``This continues to be the problem with all Central American
accords,'' said Luis Sanchez Sancho of the National Opposition
Union, a coalition that opposes Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista
government in elections set for Feb. 25.
   Cristiani said the five presidents had a position paper from the
Salvadoran rebels.
   ``Two of the presidents laughed. Others read it with dismay,''
he said. ``The impression was that it was too much gall on the part
of the FMLN, after what they have done, to continue trying to look
like Robin Hood.''
   Ortega said the success of the accord hinges on the cooperation
of the United States.
   Washington ``has the main responsibility for the demobilization
of the Contras because they continue financing them and sending
them supplies,'' he said in a national radio and television address
in Nicaragua on Tuesday.
   The summit accord implicitly chides the United States, the
Soviet Union and Cuba by saying ``nations with interests in the
region'' should be more directly involved in the peace process. The
presidents also requested increased U.N. involvement in the effort
to demobilize ``irregular forces.''
   The Salvadoran rebels have rejected the summit accord, saying it
does nothing to contribute to the possibility of a negotiated
solution to the civil war they have waged for more than a decade
against a series of U.S.-backed governments.
   ``The FMLN cannot be demobilized by means of agreements between
governments, because it is a legitimate force with popular roots in
the whole Salvadoran territory,'' they said in a communique.
   The summit followed a sharp escalation in the Salvadoran civil
war, which has claimed more than 71,000 lives. The rebels launched
a huge offensive on Nov. 11 in which more than 1,500 people _
guerrillas, soldiers and civilians _ are estimated to have been
killed.
   The accord calls on the FMLN to stop fighting and resume peace
talks with Cristiani's rightist government.
   ``With this agreement, the FMLN loses its room to maneuver,''
said Cristiani. ``The presidents are saying to the guerrillas: `You
have no right to continue violent actions.'''
   If the FMLN keeps fighting, ``the armed forces of El Salvador
will deal with them,'' Cristiani told a news conference Tuesday
after returning from the summit.
   Cristiani said his government is willing to resume peace talks
broken off by the rebels Oct. 31 after the bombing of a union
headquarters. But he said the FMLN must cease hostilities first.
   The FMLN had earlier called for a cease-fire with international
verification and recognition of territories under their control.
   ``That position is definitely unacceptable,'' said Cristiani.
   Ortega said his delegation insisted on international
verification of human rights and again criticized the Salvadoran
government for the assassination during the FMLN offensive of six
Jesuit academics.
   The murders have been blamed on the military.
   Presidents Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras, Vinicio Cerezo of
Guatemala and host Oscar Arias of Costa Rica also signed the summit
accord.

<HEAD>Bill Would Grant Aquino Further Emergency Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Representatives today
approved a bill granting further emergency powers to President
Corazon Aquino to impose law and order after last week's failed
coup attempt.
   In the Senate, the passage of a similar bill was blocked, with
an opposition senator warning the legislation moved the nation a
step closer to dictatorship. The Senate is expected to pass a
similar version Thursday.
   The bill was passed overwhelmingly on second reading in the
lower chamber. A final reading will be held Thursday.
   Lone opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who once administered
martial law under the late Ferdinand Marcos, denounced the
emergency decree as a move toward dictatorship. But former human
rights lawyer Sen. Rene Saguisag defended the move in light of the
recent coup attempt.
   In a speech before the Senate, Enrile said the emergency powers
also could be used to extend the lease on the U.S. military bases
in the Philippines.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said today that rebel soldiers who
launched the coup attempt Dec. 1 were still capable of staging
terror attacks and assassinations, although they surrendered their
last stronghold Saturday.
   Ramos told a news conference the government will no longer seek
U.S. air cover over Philippine territory.
   U.S. jets flew over rebel-held bases to discourage more bombing
runs on the Malacanang presidential palace, and the U.S. help
turned the tide in favor of the government on the first day of the
mutiny.
   The Cabinet also was told that the business community is looking
for signs the government will move decisively to address the
political, social and economic damage wrought by the sixth and
bloodiest attempt so far to oust Mrs. Aquino. Share prices on the
Manila Stock Exchange fell for the third consecutive day since
trading resumed after the coup attempt.
   On Dec. 6, Mrs. Aquino declared a nationwide state of emergency,
but officials said the legislation would give her further powers.
   The House and Senate versions of the emergency bill grant Mrs.
Aquino the power to order the search for weapons and ammunition in
private homes without the normal legal constraints.
   The House voted against allowing Mrs. Aquino to intervene in
labor disputes and suspend labor laws which may impede production.
A majority of the 23-member Senate voted to keep the provision,
regarded by critics as a strike ban.
   Both versions allow Mrs. Aquino to take over public utilities,
such as privately-owned transportation firms if they violate
``national policy.''
   The House bill limits Mrs. Aquino's emergency powers to a 90-day
period, while the Senate version extends it up to six months.

   Freezing temperatures extended across the Deep South to the Gulf
of Mexico today, and the cold was so bitter in the Plains that
Salvation Army bell ringers had trouble getting people to pause
long enough to donate.
   ``People don't want to stop and dig in their pockets for
change,'' said Salvation Army Lt. James Castor in Kearney, Neb.
   On the Gulf of Mexico, this morning's low temperature was just
26 degrees at Mobile, Ala. Temperatures in northern Alabama fell
into the teens.
   The second snowstorm to hit Virginia in five days produced
scores of accidents on slippery roads. At least two people died.
   About 10 inches of snow fell by early today in Powhatan County,
just west of Richmond, and the city had up to 6 inches of snow.
Many schoolchildren today were enjoying their fourth straight day
off.
   Schools also were closed today in 28 districts in Maryland and
Delaware after a storm that left up to 7 inches of snow. Most
schools around Washington, D.C., which got 3 to 8 inches, either
closed today or opened late, and the federal government allowed
employees to report up to two hours late.
   Snow fell from South Carolina to upstate New York. In the
Midwest and Great Plains, temperatures were expected to remain
bitter through the weekend.
   Polar bears at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Neb., reveled in
the cold, swimming in a pool that a pump kept from freezing over.
   ``They're insane,'' zoo director Lee Simmons said. ``Never mind
the freezing temperatures, they're out there swimming!''
   The Peoria Rescue Mission, a homeless shelter in the Illinois
city, reported a rush of people seeking a place to sleep with lows
of 5 below zero predicted this morning, and up to 3 inches of snow.
   In northern Minnesota, today's low was 21 below zero at
International Falls, where the temperature never crept above minus
2 below all day Tuesday.
   Bismarck, N.D., had a low 14 below zero. Devils Lake hit 18
below and Fargo bottomed out at 13 below, with a 17 mph wind
creating a wind chill factor of minus 52. Michigan's low was 12
below zero at Tellston, and Chicago reached minus 1.
   About 2 inches of snow fell Tuesday evening on Bristol, in
eastern Tennessee, and an inch fell on Knoxville. In Elizabethton,
four men braved a swift current to pull two people from an
overturned truck after it slipped in snow and plunged off a bridge
and into a creek.
   Western North Carolina was covered by up to 3 inches of snow
that caused dangerous road conditions but no major wrecks or
serious injuries, authorities said.
   ``Significant snows before Christmastime don't occur frequently
in this area,'' said Andy Scott of the National Weather Service.
``This is our second one and it looks like we're going to get our
third this weekend.''
   Schools in Birmingham, Ala., shut down after warnings of snow
Tuesday night. But the skies cleared, plunging temperatures into
the teens, said Tom King, a meteorologist for the weather service
in Birmingham.
   ``The big catchword now instead of `snow' is it's going to be
cold,'' King said.
   Predicting snow in the South is difficult because of the
region's location, said Bob Dietlein, a weather service specialist
in Birmingham.
   ``We usually are on the borderline, and so often when we have a
freak snow storm that dumps heavy amounts on us, we only have a
short notice,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, temperatures dropped below 20 degrees below zero
around the upper Great Lakes and it was briefly colder in Phoenix
than in Anchorage due to a warm high pressure mass over Alaska.
   Tuesday's official low for the Lower 48 states was minus 28
degrees at International Falls, and 13 cities in the central part
of the nation hit record lows _ including 5 degrees below zero at
Kansas City, Mo.; 12 degrees in Abilene, Texas; and 8 in El Paso.
   ``From Canada we have a flow of air straight out of the north
from southwest Canada. It's coming almost from the Arctic Circle,''
said Craig Ellis, head forecaster for the weather service office in
Phoenix, where it was 37 degrees Tuesday morning.

   Kidnappers today freed a senior Cabinet
minister's daughter they had held for six days after the government
met their demand and released five jailed Moslem militants,
officials said.
   Rubaiya Sayeed, 22, was released two hours after the prisoners
went free, thereby ending the first crisis of the 12-day-old
government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh, state-run television
reported.
   The chairman of the militants' organization warned of future
kidnappings unless the government ``behaves.''
   The television flashed a news bulletin saying ``Rubaiya Sayeed
Freed,'' interrupting a cricket match between India and Pakistan.
   Ms. Sayeed's father is Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. She
was kidnapped at gunpoint on Friday in Srinagar, the summer capital
of Jammu-Kashmir state and a popular tourist resort, and the
separatist Kashmir Liberation Front claimed responsibility.
   Militants had threatened to kill Ms. Sayeed, a medical intern,
unless their five jailed comrades were freed. The release followed
haggling over the site of the swap and the safety of the prisoners.
   The five were released at an undisclosed site in the city,
culminating five days of negotiations between the government and
the front, said the police officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   About two hours after the militants were released, a dazed Ms.
Sayeed was dropped at a friend's house and then taken to her home.
Later, she was to be flown to New Delhi for a reunion with her
family.
   ``By the grace of the Almighty and the blessings of millions of
my countrymen, Rubaiya has a new lease on life,'' a relieved Sayeed
said after hearing his youngest daughter was safe. ``Our ordeal of
anxiety and agony has ended. Their prayers and good wishes have
restored our child to us.''
   Sayeed, unshaven but smiling and wrapped in a brown shawl,
condemned his daughter's captors.
   ``There is no bravery in attacking a girl. It is cowardly. You
don't need guns and swords to attack a girl,'' he said. ``They have
lost the sympathy of the people in the state, in India and the
world.''
   Among the freed militants was Abdul Hamid Sheikh, a top leader
in the Kashmir Liberation Front, police said. Sheikh, who was
arrested last month after being wounded in a clash with police, was
taken by ambulance from a Srinagar hospital to the site and turned
over to his organization.
   The other four were identified as Noor Mohammad Kalwal, Mohammad
Altaf Bhat, Sher Khan Azad and Javed Ahmed Zargar, officials said.
All had been arrested on suspicion of subversive activities during
the past year but no charges had been filed.
   As news of the swap spread throughout the city, 3,000 people
filled the streets, setting off firecrackers, waving Pakistan flags
and shouting anti-India slogans.
   In Pakistan, Amanullah Khan, chairman of the militants' group,
said India had made ``a wise step'' and he hoped the government
would adopt ``a similar wise attitude toward the future of Kashmir
and leave Kashmir honorably instead of waiting until it is shunted
out and humiliated by Kashmiri freedom fighters.''
   Asked whether the swap would encourage the front to launch a
campaign of kidnappings to secure its demands, Khan said: ``It
depends on how the Indian government behaves ... because they
compelled us to take this step.''
   The Kashmir Liberation Front, which wants Jammu-Kashmir to
either become independent or part of Islamic Pakistan, commands a
large following in the Moslem-dominated Srinagar.
   The front, formed in 1965, has often attacked the government and
sponsored successful strikes in Jammu-Kashmir, the only Moslem
majority state in the predominantly Hindu India.
   At India's request, the government of Pakistan had appealed to
the militants not to harm Ms. Sayeed.
   Moslems make up 64 percent of the state's 5 million people, but
comprise just 11 percent of India's 880 million people. Hindus
account for about 80 percent of the population.
   Kashmir is claimed both by India and Pakistan, and the two
countries have fought three wars over the territory since gaining
independence from Britain in 1947.
   In a bid to halt the separatism, the new prime minister
appointed Sayeed, a Kashmiri, as head of a Cabinet committee on
Jammu-Kashmir and neighboring Punjab, where Sikh militants also are
demanding an independent homeland.
   Sayeed is the first Moslem to be named India's home minister, a
key post that oversees the country's internal security. The
appointment was seen as part of Singh's efforts to appease Moslems
who have borne the brunt of Hindu-Moslem religious riots that
claimed more than 300 lives this fall. Singh is a Hindu.

<HEAD>Students' Pedal Copter Certified as Making First Human-Powered Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Engineering students who designed
a pedal-operated flying machine have been notified that its 6.8
seconds in the air have been certified as the first human-powered
helicopter flight, officials said today.
   ``We are satisfied it was not a jump start, but a bona fide
hover that did take place,'' said Malvern Gross, president of the
National Aeronautic Association in Washington.
   The aircraft, dubbed Da Vinci III by the students at California
Polytechnic State University, hovered about 8 inches off the ground
Sunday under the observation of an NAA consultant, Cal Poly
spokesman Bob Anderson said.
   The NAA, the official keeper of U.S. aviation records, certified
the feat late Tuesday, Gross said. Although school officials at the
time said the flight lasted 7.1 seconds, the observer clocked it at
6.8 seconds, the agency said.
   The record-setting flight won't be the end of the school's
development of human-powered aircraft. ``This will just make them
work harder,'' Anderson said. ``They're already talking about
building Da Vinci IV when they get back from vacation.''
   Engineering students built the 97-pound, 100-foot-long Da Vinci
III out of space-age materials, including carbon graphite. The
machine was powered by cyclist Greg McNeil.
   Da Vinci III flew twice before, on Nov. 12 and Nov. 27. The
experimental vehicle is the fourth pedal-copter built by Cal Poly
students since 1981.
   When they build Da Vinci IV, the students will try to lighten
their flying machine, Anderson said.
   The ultimate goal is a $20,000 prize offered by the American
Helicopter Society to the first group to fly a human-powered
helicopter for one minute and reach a height of at least three
meters.

   The Bush administration is considering lifting
a ban on satellite exports to China, continuing to chip away at
sanctions imposed on Beijing after its violent crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   President Bush ``did not intend to disrupt normal civilian
commercial relations'' when he barred military exports to China
last spring, and officials are reviewing the sanctions with that in
mind, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   Bush today refused to reply during a photo session when asked if
he was prepared to lift the ban on satellite transfers.
   The news from the White House brought condemnation from Rep. Sam
Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of House Foreign Policy subcommittee
on international economic policy and trade. He said the idea of
lifting the sanction on satellites ``makes no sense whatsoever.''
   ``In China, where the government has only tightened the screws,
the Bush administration seems to see no limit on what they ought to
try to do to help the Chinese government,'' Gejdenson said.
   Last weekend, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger went to Beijing to
explore the possibility of resuming relations with China. The trip,
an exception to the president's ban on high-level contacts with
China, also drew sharp criticism from congressional Democrats.
   Asked about the trip today during a photo session with Bush,
Scowcroft told a reporter only that it was ``long.''
   A third administration official, White House personnel director
Chase Untermeyer, joined the duo on the China trip to make personal
contacts for the president, the White House said.
   Untermeyer confirmed that he went and said he also had
accompanied Bush to China in 1977 and 1982. He said he spoke last
weekend with U.S. officials there regarding personnel matters but
did not elaborate.
   White House spokesman Steve Hart said Untermeyer's main mission
was to speak to two Chinese friends of Bush, who served as liaison
officer, then the highest-ranking U.S. representative in Beijing,
in 1974-75.
   Hart said Untermeyer purpose was ``simply to hear their thoughts
about the changes going on in China'' since the Tiananmen Square
massacre last spring. One of Bush's Chinese friends is a mid-level
government official and the other is a former member of the
governent, Hart said.
   The Hughes Aircraft-manufactured communications satellites fall
in the category of items on the government's sensitive munitions
list that were automatically included in the suspension, U.S.
officials said.
   ``No decision has been made ... but it is possible,'' those
satellites will be freed for delivery, Fitzwater said.
   Two of them are under Hughes contract to a joint
Australian-Chinese venture and the third are for a British-Chinese
consortium in Hong Kong, he said. China will launch the satellites
for the Australian firm, AUSSAT, and the Hong Kong consortium,
AsiaSat.
   Australia has been pushing for a waiver and has received
indications the administration will make a decision in its favor by
the end of the year, said Australian Embassy political counselor
Roger Uren.
   ``We have made it clear this is important to us. We have a sense
the Americans understand,'' he said Tuesday. ``We basically get a
positive sense.''
   One of Australia's satellites is to be launched in April and the
others in 1991 and 1992, while the British-Chinese one is to go up
on a Chinese launch vehicle in April.
   Licenses for export had been granted for all three satellites
before the sanctions were imposed. The State Department ``advised
Hughes it would consider a request for an exemption from the
suspension,'' but there has been no decision, said Hughes spokesman
Don O'Neal.
   Bush imposed sanctions on June 5 in the wake of Beijing's attack
that killed hundreds of Tiananmen Square protesters.
   The order included a ban on export of weapons and military
equipment, satellites and nuclear supplies, as well as suspension
of any loans to China from the World Bank and the Asia Development
Bank.
   Since then, the administration has allowed export of five Boeing
jetliners, whose guidance system was on the U.S. munitions control
list of sensitive technology. Boeing spokesman Randy Harrison said
the government ultimately agreed that the planes' navigation device
was for civilian use and could not be removed for military use
without being obvious.
   The administration also has permitted Chinese engineers to
resume work in the United States on a $500 million program to
upgrade Chinese F-8 fighter planes with sophisticated electronics
equipment. The White House said no planes were to be delivered, in
accordance with the ban on military exports.
   The administration is looking for signs of change in Chinese
repressive policies before normalizing relations, he said.
   There has been no change in the deferral of $957 million in
World Bank loans and $336 million in Asian development Bank loans,
said Fitzwater.

   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, spurning the demands
of progressives, offered an economic reform plan today that
continues the ban on private property and generally maintains
central control of the economy.
   The 2,250-member Congress interrupted the premier's nearly
two-hour speech with applause only once. About half the deputies
clapped when Ryzhkov declared that ``the state is the owner of the
means of production.''
   Ryzhkov claimed he was offering a radical reform ``for carrying
the economy out of a crisis.'' Food and consumer goods are in
painfully short supply, and authorities now wonder if they will
have enough fuel to heat Soviet apartments through the long winter.
   Ryzhkov's speech displeased progressives who pushed
unsuccessfully on Tuesday to have the Congress take up legislation
to liberalize private property ownership and to consider lifting
the Communist Party's monopoly on power.
   Such deputies insist that Communist ideology must be divorced
from economic policy if the country is to pull itself out of a
grave economic crisis.
   ``Five years ago, we said it was a choice between five-year
plans and perestroika, and unfortunately, it turns out the
five-year plan has won,'' said economist and parliamentarian Pavel
Bunich in the lobby outside the snow-covered Kremlin's Palace of
Congresses.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev successfully defeated attempts to
address such broad ideological questions and got the agenda he
wanted for the 10-day congress that opened Tuesday _ a focus on the
government's economic reform program, known as perestroika.
   But Ryzhkov's speech appeared more conservative than the reform
plan unveiled last month by his deputy, Leonid Abalkin. That plan
called for urgent measures to lift state controls on some prices,
sell off some unprofitable state enterprises and lay the groundwork
for a type of stock market.
   Ryzhkov spoke at length about developing a ``socialist market''
economy that the state would control, but he gave few details.
   He offered no specific proposals on letting market forces
dictate prices, which are artifically low because of state
subsidies on many goods.
   Because of consumer fears that easing price controls will result
in exorbitant prices, the government will discuss compensation for
price increases beginning next year and only afterwards draft the
reform, he said.
   The premier also said the government would begin relying less on
centralized planning in a second stage of reform beginning in 1993.
   But his report appeared to contain nothing to give Soviets an
incentive to work efficiently.
   ``We have to leave free to the market only that part of
production that would not lead to unbalancing the economy,''
Ryzhkov said.
   The official Tass news agency said Ryzhkov rejected demands for
private property ownership.
   He repeated previously announced plans to shift more production
from heavy industry to consumer goods and to improve technology.
   The reforms that Gorbachev began when he rose to power in 1985
are now being outpaced by changes in other East bloc nations. In
other developments in the region:
   _Czechoslovak Communists and leading opposition leaders in
Prague debated the process and time frame for naming a new
president, which is expected to be leading dissident Vaclav Havel.
   _East Germany's overhauled Communist Party said it would adhere
to socialist principles despite the pro-democracy reforms advocated
by the opposition. The party is positioning itself as an
alternative to the opposition for free elections that are to be
held in May.
   In Moscow, many progressives said the government should, instead
of releasing yet another economic report, offer specific
legislation that the Congress could immediately take up.
   They also criticized the ruling Communists for refusing to back
the legalization of private property, which many economists
consider crucial to ending chronic consumer shortages and
industrial inefficiency.
   ``If we want a free economy, free from unnatural influence, let
enterprises be enterprises without any ideological violence over
them,'' said one deputy, Sergei Stankevich.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, who had called for a
two-hour general strike Monday to press for elimination of the
Communists' constitutionally guaranteed leading role, urged the
Congress on Tuesday to take up all parts of the Soviet Constitution
that inhibit economic reform.
   But Gorbachev on Tuesday dismissed that idea as too general, and
cut him off when he tried to elaborate.
   In a series of key tests on the opening day of the Congress,
moves to broaden the debate were shot down. A bid to put the
Communist Party's constitutional status on the agenda did best.
   It received 839 votes, but 1,138 deputies voted against it.
Yevgeny Yevtushenko, one of the country's best-known poets, called
the result a ``noble defeat'' because 87 percent of the deputies
are Communist Party members.

   The top Department of Housing and Urban
Development officials in Los Angeles and New Orleans are resigning
after refusing transfers ordered by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp as part
of an agency management shakeup.
   Also affected by a flurry of personnel moves in recent weeks are
a onetime assistant to former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr., the
former heads of HUD's Baltimore and Richmond, Va., offices, the
agency's top official in Oklahoma City and its No. 2 official in
Chicago.
   None of the moves have been announced publicly. But a HUD
spokesman in Los Angeles confirmed Tuesday that Benjamin Bobo is
resigning as head of that office and will be replaced in February
by Charles Ming, now the Oklahoma City manager. Los Angeles, with
234 workers, is HUD's largest field office.
   Bobo submitted his resignation, effective Feb. 20, after
declining Kemp's offer that he take over the New Orleans office,
Reed said.
   Two HUD sources in Washington, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the current New Orleans HUD manager, Richard
Franco, told Kemp he would resign rather than accept a transfer to
become head of HUD's Newark, N.J., office. Attempts to reach Franco
late Tuesday were unsuccessful and the effective date of his
resignation could not be determined.
   Kemp has said he would replace HUD managers he did not believe
were performing adequately or did not respond aggressively to his
efforts to rid the agency of mismanagement and influence-peddling,
the subject of recent congressional hearings focusing largely on
Pierce's tenure.
   The transfer offers to Bobo and Franco are examples of Kemp
using his power to ``send more than adequate signals'' of his
displeasure, said one source. The jobs offered to Bobo and Franco
are regarded within HUD as demotions and would have required them
to make long-distance moves just before the December holidays.
   Ted Britton Jr., who under Pierce headed an office of
international affairs, accepted the Newark job after Franco turned
it down, the sources said. Kemp had abolished the international
affairs office and reassigned Britton to another headquarters job.
   The New Orleans job has been offered to George T. Ray Jr.,
currently the No. 2 official in HUD's Chicago office but he has not
yet indicated whether he will accept, the sources said.
   The Oklahoma City job has yet to be offered, and HUD also is
looking for a new manager for its Baltimore office.
   St. George Crosse, a Maryland Republican appointed to head that
office two years ago after he lost a congressional race, began
working at HUD headquarters in Washington this week after he lost a
bid to keep his job. Kemp was unhappy with the management of the
Baltimore office, the sources said.
   The former Richmond office manager, G. William Thomas, has been
given a second temporary reassignment after being removed from his
post three months ago because of Kemp's displeasure with the
office's operation.
   Kemp first dispatched Thomas to Charleston, W.Va., for a 120-day
temporary assignment, and now has demoted him three civil service
grades and sent him to Pittsburgh for a three-month stint as a HUD
loan officer.
   Bobo was criticized last year in an Office of Government Ethics
report that found HUD executives violated conflict of interest
rules by raising money from private contractors to pay for a fair
housing campaign that was a pet project of Pierce. Bobo was singled
out for raising $15,000 from a local Board of Realtors to help pay
for the campaign.
   Bobo, 44, came to HUD headquarters at the beginning of the
Reagan administration and has headed the Los Angeles office since
1984.
   His replacement, Ming, 60, is an attorney who was appointed
manager of the Oklahoma City office in February 1984. That office
has been deeply involved in widespread Federal Housing
Administration mortgage fraud investigations.
   Attempts to reach Bobo and Ming were unsuccessful. Calls to Bobo
were referred to Reed and calls to Ming's office late Tuesday went
unanswered.
   It was not immediately clear why Kemp was unhappy with Franco's
performance, although one of the sources said ``there were a lot of
political problems down there.'' Calls to Franco's office late
Tuesday were unanswered.

   A man threatened the president of the Pop
Warner Youth Football League in the name of a major Mafia figure
for disqualifying a mob-connected team from the championships, the
league president says.
   David Tomlin, president of Pop Warner, said he was told by the
unidentified person to reinstate the team.
   ``The fact that we all appeared at the national championships
this past weekend should reassure everyone that any real threats
against us were effectively neutralized,'' Tomlin said in a
statement Tuesday.
   The threats, which were also made against a staff member, began
Nov. 8 and ``several minor physical incidents'' also took place,
Tomlin said. The statement did not elaborate. It did not identity
the team or the Mafia figure.
   Nor did the statement give the nature of the threats or say why
the team was disqualified or how it was connected to organized
crime.
   Tomlin did not immediately return a telephone call this morning.
   The FBI was notified of the alleged threat. However, FBI
spokesman John Kundts would not confirm nor deny any investigation.
   Tomlin said he he did not know of any arrests.
   Pop Warner football, for boys as young as 8, annually
disqualifies about 30 teams from its championships for various
reasons, Tomlin said. All records of teams disqualified in 1989
have been destroyed to protect those not involved, he said.

   Poland and Hungary today outlined their
economic reforms at a meeting with 24 Western nations that are
coordinating aid to prevent Eastern Europe's reforms from being
derailed by economic troubles.
   In separate presentations, Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof
Skubiszewski and Gyula Horn, his Hungarian counterpart, said their
countries were creating market-oriented economies.
   Also, they said, they soon will conclude talks with the
International Monetary Fund for financial rescue packages that
would free extra Western loans and help in easing their huge
foreign debts.
   In return, the IMF insists that both countries must adopt sound
economic policies.
   ``One of our most important aims is to shape a healthy ...
enterprise structure,'' Horn told the foreign ministers of the
donor nations, including the United States, the 12 European
Community countries, Japan, Canada and Australia.
   ``Our top priority is to maintain the country's
credit-worthiness and to assure access to normal market financial
resources that enable us to fulfill our far-reaching political and
economic objectives,'' he added.
   Skubiszewski detailed efforts to ``demonopolize'' the Polish
economy ``by opening wider the doors to free enterprise.''
   Hungary and Poland have been at the forefront of the democratic
changes reshaping Eastern Europe. Poland has the East bloc's first
non-Communist premier, and Hungary has opened its borders, promised
multiparty elections and formally disbanded the Communist Party.
   Sources said both East European officials were questioned by
several delegations about details of their economic reform programs
and the measure of support they have in Warsaw and Budapest.
   The meeting was the first between Secretary of State James Baker
III and his 23 counterparts since President Bush and other world
leaders suggested an aid program for Eastern Europe at a summit
meeting in Paris in July.
   Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said today the talks
were ``of great significance.''
   ``It is extremely important to remove ... the economic hardships
which confront Poland and Hungary and to enhance the smooth
implementation of the economic reconstruction and development so
that budding reform in the two countries will develop unimpaired
and finally bear fruit.''
   Nakayama said his government was prepared to offer $150 million
to an economic stabilization fund for Poland as soon as the Warsaw
government reaches an agreement with the IMF.
   The European Community was put in charge of coordinating the aid
program. The leaders recommended the financial help as a way of
encouraging the drive in those East European countries for more
open political systems and market-oriented economies.
   Frans Andriessen, the EC external relations commissioner, urged
the donor nations to extend their aid program to other East
European nations that are moving toward democracy.
   Nico Wegter, a spokesman for the European Community, said: ``The
main purpose (of today's meeting) is to give sufficient political
momentum to follow up'' the Paris summit.
   Officials say the nations, called the Group of 24, have offered
roughly $4 billion to $6 billion in help, ranging from loans and
emergency food shipments to export credit guarantees.
   Baker said in a speech Tuesday to the Berlin Press Club that the
United States has authorized almost $1 billion in assistance to the
two countries.
   He said that as reforms in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and East
Germany match those of Poland and Hungary, ``we believe the
activities of the Group of 24 ... should be expanded to support
peaceful change in these countries as well.''
   Michel Camdessus, head of the IMF, said Monday that a letter of
intent for a $700 million loan agreement with Poland could be
initialed this week. Poland has a foreign debt of $40 billion.
Hungary has a foreign debt of $20 billion.
   Attending today's meeting were EC members Britain, Ireland,
Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, France,
Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece. Others are the United States,
Canada, Australia, Turkey, New Zealand, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland,
Finland, Austria, Norway and Iceland.

   The ruling Communist Party today decided
to ask Parliament to formally abolish the party's monopoly on power
by repealing constitutional clauses guaranteeing party supremacy,
state media said.
   Also today, the party expelled long-time leader Todor Zhivkov
along with his son and a close associate, the state BTA news agency
reported.
   The developments, which came on the third day of a key session
of the Communist Party Central Committee, are in line with new
leader Petar Mladenov's stated goal of reforming the party and
democratizing society.
   They also are in line with the rapid changes under way elsewhere
in the East bloc. In Czechoslovakia and East Germany, the Communist
Party has lost its constitutional guarantee of supremacy, and in
Poland the party lost its supremacy in elections.
   The state news agency BTA said the Communist Party's
parliamentary committee planned Thursday to introduce a motion to
abolish two constitutional paragraphs. One establishes the party as
``the leading force in society and in (the) state,'' and the other
says the party ``heads the construction of an advanced socialist
society.''
   The report did not elaborate.
   BTA offered no details on the ousting of Zhivkov, who was
replaced as party leader Nov. 10 and removed from the ruling
Politburo shortly afterward.
   Also expelled were Zhivkov's son, Vladimir, and Milko Balev, a
long-time Zhivkov associate, said BTA in its one-line dispatch.
   Since his removal from power the 78-year-old Zhivkov, who led
the country for more than 35 years, has come under increasing
attacks in the state media for alleged corruption and mismanagement.
   His son Vladimir, said to have enjoyed an opulent lifestyle
during his father's tenure, was removed from his job at the Central
Committee's culture department less than two weeks after his father
was toppled from his positions as party chief and state president.
   The Central Committe and Politburo have been purged repeatedly
since new party chief Petar Mladenov took power and embarked on a
course of reform similar to that under way in other East bloc
countries.
   Also today Peter Dyulgerov, the head of the official trade
unions, resigned from the ruling Politburo. He was seen as a
holdover from the Zhivkov regime.
   In an effort to appease Bulgaria's growing pro-democracy
movement, Mladenov has largely revamped the Politburo by bringing
in new people more likely to embrace reform.
   Dyulgerov reportedly said he was resigning as president of the
trade unions because they had recently declared their independence
from party domination. It was not clear whether he remained on the
policy-making Central Committee.
   Thousands of Bulgarians held a candlelight vigil outside party
headquarters Tuesday evening to emphasize their call for political
change.
   Several speakers denounced Zhivkov and accused the old
leadership of economic and political blunders.
   Politburo member Alexander Lilov repeated earlier calls for the
punishment of Zhivkov and his closest associates, and questioned
how the system could allow ``dictators'' to rule so long. Zhivkov
had been in power since 1954.
   Mladenov proposed Monday that the party relinquish its
consitutional monopoly on power and open dialogue with independent
groups. He also proposed that free elections be announced by May
1990.
   Also Tuesday the head of the Sofia City Committee, Georgi
Grigorov, likened the Communist Party to a sinking ship with a crew
``beheaded'' by decades of hard-line rule. He said the party was
``beheaded in terms of personnel.''
   ``Who are the young economists, who are the professionals, who
are our ideologists?'' Grigorov asked according to the state news
agency BTA, which carried excerpts from the closed-door session.
   ``Maybe we have these young people, but all of them were molded
in a similar way,'' he said. ``We put all of them on our ship,
which is sinking.''
   Boiko Dimitrov, who replaced Mladenov as foreign minister last
month, suggested that some people in the Central Committee still
linked to the Zhivkov government should resign.
   Evgeni Alexandrov, a Central Committee member and party
spokesman, told a news conference that it was ``more important that
the Communist Party members realize...that we are living in a
different age and elect a Central Committee that would act on that
(reform) policy.''
   He said several of the more than 30 speakers who took the floor
Tuesday criticized Zhivkov's rule and ``the administrative
bureaucratic system'' that allowed it. Others, he said, supported
Mladenov's call for dialogue with independent groups.

<HEAD>FAA, NTSB Looking into Rudder Trim Problems Following N.Y. Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen reports of problems with rudder
controls on Boeing 737s have been made since a plane skidded off a
New York airport runway with such a problem, two federal agencies
say.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday they have asked the Boeing
Co. to provide data on any reports it has received before or since
the New York accident on rudders set in unexpected positions on its
737-300 and 737-400 model jets.
   The FAA will use the information to decide whether to order any
action, such as a design change or modification, said FAA spokesman
David Duff in Seattle.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz in Washington, D.C., said the
agency had received at least a dozen reports, two involving foreign
airlines, of instances ``where the crew says it discovered the
rudder was trimmed in a way that they didn't expect.''
   ``The FAA has looked into the incidents to try to determine if
the cause was related to human factors or a mechanical problem or a
combination of both,'' Duff said.
   The inquiries are limited to the Boeing 737-300 and 737-400
models because they have electrically driven controls. Earlier
737-100 and 737-200 models have manual cranks.
   NTSB investigators found that the rudder was improperly set on a
USAir jet trying to take off from LaGuardia Airport on Sept. 20.
The 737-400 veered on the runway and the crew aborted takeoff, but
the plane skidded into the East River. The plane broke into three
pieces and two passengers were killed and 45 injured.
   The investigations will look into whether a crew member
inadvertently activated the rudder switch and examine the cockpit
gauge that indicates how the rudder is set, Duff said.
   Boeing Commercial Planes spokesman Dick Schleh said the firm is
compiling the data for investigators.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country:
   Dec. 8
   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on the Philippines:
   Philippines President Corazon Aquino appears to have survived
another coup attempt, the sixth and most serious one she has
endured since taking office four years ago.
   This time, it took U.S. intervention to help her through. The
U.S. responded properly. But in the long run, intervention may
prove to be the catalyst that finally altered relations between the
United States and the Philippines.
   The United States would be wise to step up plans to move its two
important military bases from the Philippines: Subic Bay naval base
and Clark air base.
   Subic Bay and Clark are the largest U.S. bases on foreign soil
and are of strategic importance in the Southeast Asia region.
However, the bases are also becoming increasingly unpopular with
Filipinos.
   Aquino's recent actions will no doubt make the bases even more
unpopular in the Philippines. ...
   (A)t Aquino's request, U.S. jets flew air cover for loyalist
Philippine forces. The move helped prevent insurgents from
continuing their own air strikes and taking over Aquino's
government.
   U.S. fighter planes did not fire on rebel troops. But just the
fact the U.S. warplanes threatened Philippines people enraged many
Filipinos.
   President Bush and Vice President Quayle responded quickly _ and
properly _ to Aquino's request.
   The United States helped preserve a democratically elected
government and, in doing so, also protected U.S. military
interests. But Aquino had to have been desperate to make such an
extreme request.

   Star Tribune, Minneapolis, on drug wars:
   Here's the way Colombia's troubles, on such horrendous display
lately, ought to get resolved.
   An Avianca airliner is blown up at the direction of a cocaine
cartel. Drug lords are probably behind the car-bombing that
shredded national police headquarters and surrounding buildings in
Bogota. President Virgilio Barco pledges to keep fighting the
cartels. Colombians, having lived under democracy most of this
century, resoundingly support the government. The cartels crumble.
   Unfortunately, the happy ending is wishful thinking. Violence on
a grand scale has visited Colombia periodically, as in the 1950s,
when hundreds of thousands died; it could return. And the cocaine
trade enriches Colombia's economy while prices for coffee, its
leading export, have fallen.
   The lesson is familiar: The best way for the United States to
help Colombia fight its drug war is to cut drug demand at home.

   Tampa (Fla.) Tribune on the drug summit:
   (The) bomb blast in downtown Bogota that killed at least 42
peeple and injured more than 1,000 was a terrible tragedy. But even
more spine-chilling for Americans was a bomb attack that killed two
policemen in Cartagena.
   Cartagena is the tentative site of a mid-February drug
``summit'' of President Bush and Latin American presidents.
Cartagena _ or anywhere else in Colombia _ is too risky for the
U.S. President to be, for whatever purpose.

   The Seattle Times on auto insurance:
   A long road through the courts lies ahead, but a ruling ... by
the California insurance commissioner is an overdue stab at the
inequities that permeate the auto insurance rate jungle.
   Under the ruling ... a California driver's address, gender or
marital status no longer can be considered by insurance companies
when setting rates. ...
   There is something intrinsically wrong in assumptions that a
single or divorced woman is a less responsible driver than a
married woman _ and should pay a higher rate. Or that men are worse
than women drivers. Or that a zip code alone makes a driver a
higher risk.
   Blanket rating by gender and marital status is as unconscionable
as rating by race. ...
   While outlawing the so-called ``ZIP code rating,'' (the ruling)
said insurers can consider population density, traffic density,
medical costs and litigation rates when establishing auto rates.
That makes sense. Insurers argue all those things are factored into
ZIP-code ratings, but it doesn't always work out that way.
   Insurance rate-setting is grossly unfair to too many people. The
industry argues it works fairly well for most. (The) ruling sends a
needed message: That's not good enough.

   The Bulletin, Bend, Ore., on the ATV industry:
   Consumer safety advocates are feigning surprise and outrage at
the results of an undercover survey which found that more than half
of all-terrain vehicle dealers violate an agreement that they not
pitch adult-size machines as being safe for youngsters under the
age of 16.
   The government was asking for this trouble when it announced an
ill-considered consent decree with ATV manufacturers in 1988. The
agreement required ATV distributors to use their ``best efforts''
to assure that dealers do not sell adult-size ATVs for use by
children. ...
   The decree was based on the flawed assumption that manufacturers
could force ATV salesmen to dissuade adults from buying the
machines for youngsters. ...
   The fact is the much-ballyhooed consent decree signed a year ago
is an ineffective way to ensure that young people do not end up on
full-size ATVs. If the government truly believes these four-wheeled
vehicles are inherently dangerous for young people, then it should
make it illegal for those under the age of 16 to drive the machines.

   The Leaf-Chronicle, Clarksville, Tenn., on the congressional pay
raise:
   The nearly 40 percent pay raise that members of the House voted
themselves in the waning days of the 1989 session probably won't be
much of an election issue next year.
   That's because the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican
parties as well as the congressional committee chairmen from each
party signed a non-aggression agreement. In part, the bipartisan
pact reads:
   ``The four of us have agreed to issue instructions to our staffs
that the vote on HR 3660 (the pay raise) is not an appropriate
point of criticism in the coming campaigns. Further we will
publicly oppose the use of this issue in any campaign in the 1990
cycle.''
   In other words, challengers to a House seat who had hoped to
make an issue of their opponents' vote for a pay raise will be
strongly urged by their own parties not to do so.
   This accommodating attitude between the two parties leads one to
wonder if the political cynics aren't correct: There no longer are
two distinct parties in Washington. They've been replaced by one
large group of incumbents whose primary aims are to keep getting
elected and reaping as many benefits as they can from the taxpayers.

   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on the S&amp;L scandal:
   The savings and loan scandal is so vast and complex that an
outraged public feels hard pressed to come up with a central
villain. ...
   M. Danny Wall will serve in that role for (now), but we should
bear in mind that the wings are crowded with bad guys. ...
   His agency (the Office of Thrift Supervision) should be put out
of its misery. ...
   As for other key villains, let's start with Rhode Island's own
Fernand St Germain, who as chairman of the House Banking Committee
pushed through legislation ... raising bank and S&amp;L deposit
insurance to $100,000 per account. That gave S&amp;L operators a big,
riskless treasure chest of capital with which to gamble.
   Then we have President Reagan's one-time chief of staff, Donald
Regan; members of Congress ... as well as the relentless lobbyists
of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. All acted to protect
shady operators as deregulation slid into nonregulation.

   Delta Democrat-Times, Greenville, Miss., on helping people get
homes:
   President Bush's plan to assist the homeless, low-income
families and first-time buyers is, in far too many respects, more
of the same from Washington: Throwing money at a perceived problem
under the assumption that only government has the solution.
   Nonetheless, his $7 billion Home Ownership and Opportunity for
People Everywhere (HOPE) makes sufficient nods in the direction of
self-help and market concepts to make the plan palatable.
   One of the program's more farsighted elements could enable
millions of renters to become homeowners. About $1 billion would be
made available for tenants to convert and rehabilitate federally
subsidized housing into resident-owned cooperatives. ...
   The best element of the plan would provide vouchers to
low-income families to help them escape from public housing
projects and find living quarters more suitable to their needs.
Encouraging families with initiatives to solve their own housing
problems makes infinitely more sense than condemning them to grim
federal projects. ...
   Clearly, HOPE is not meant as a cure-all for the nation's
housing problems. But on balance it is a positive step in
addressing those problems in ways that encourage inividual and
collective enterprise.

   The Phoenix Gazette on AIDS and civil liberties:
   It's been said that AIDS is the first politically protected
disease in history. There is some truth in that statement.
   Concern for the civil liberties of AIDS victims is appropriate,
but it ought not to be the central issue, nor should it stand in
the way of warning people at risk.
   It is difficult to understand how the spread of the disease can
be contained when no one, including those who are infected, knows
who is carrying the HIV virus.
   Some officials admit the problem and encourage voluntary testing
to control the spread of the disease. Unfortunately, voluntary
testing has limited effectiveness. For example, a study at Bellevue
Hospital in New York revealed that voluntary hospital screening
missed more than 85 percent of pregnant women infected with the
deadly virus.
   The fastest growing population of HIV-infected individuals is
I.V. drug users in inner-city minority populations.
   Perhaps it would be more useful to policy-makers if the
recommendations were put in order of priority.

   The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on communism and Fidel

   Lest anyone think communism is dying, Cuban President Fidel
Castro has declared that the demise of Communist rule in Eastern
Europe will mean a shift of global alliances.
   Castro predicted the Stalinist regimes of China, North Korea and
Vietnam will join Cuba to uphold orthodox communism.
   That boast may be only a product of Castro's exaggerated
self-importance. But the fact remains that, while the Soviet Union
is allowing communism's strength to be sapped in Eastern Europe, it
continues to subsidize Cuba and the Marxist government in Nicaragua
to the tune of more than $6 billion a year.

   Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News on communism:
   A poll says half of all Americans think communism has failed and
is now on its deathbed.
   We think that possibly they may be half right. Marxism is
generally regarded as a failure. But what we perceive as the evils
of the communist system could persist under any number of new names.
   We should never forget that rivalries among nations spring from
deeper causes than ideology. The nations of Europe have been
warring for years over territory and economic advantage. Communism
was no more than a radical pipedream when the nations of Europe
blundered into World War I. National antipathies and rivalries
brought that on. And many of the same rivalries and antipathies
exist today.
   It is only human to expect that every favorable development on
the international scene means the millennium is being ushered in.
But history tells us not to expect it. History tells us that world
powers always tend to collide when their interests conflict. We
must never lose hope, but we must never expect too much.
Complacency, such as that reflected in the poll, could prove to be
our worst enemy.

relations:
   When Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with Pope John Paul II in the
Vatican, many commentators recalled Joseph Stalin's facetious
remark to Winston Churchill: ``How many divisions does the pope
have?''
   Yet the historic encounter between the head of the Roman
Catholic Church and the leader of the international communist
movement signified more than an acknowledgment by ... Gorbachev
that the pope's power cannot be measured in military terms. ...
   Gorbachev cannot, even should he wish to, rule through terror,
like Stalin. It is too late for that. ... He must respond to the
beliefs of the people of the Soviet Union.
   His predecessors were forced to come to an accommodation with
the Russian Orthodox Church, based on the latter's subservience.
... Gorbachev has had to come to an agreement with the pope that
acknowledges the spiritual power of the Catholic Church.
   The Soviet leader will also have to come to an accommodation
with the other divisions of religion, under the banner of Islam as
well as Christianity, as the world witnesses, not the death of God,
but the agony of communism.

   Los Angeles Daily News on defense spending:
   In anticipation of an enormous ``peace dividend'' from improved
superpower relations, members of Congress have already begun laying
plans for allocating the tens _ or even hundreds _ of billions of
dollars that are expected to be saved on defense. The idea is to
shift the windfall to domestic programs, from education to the war
on drugs. ...
   Congress, in its eagerness to fatten politically popular
domestic programs, may cut too much from defense and leave American
forces dangerously weakened in a world that still has its dangers,
whatever happens in East-West relations. ...
   To prevent a weakening of America's defenses, both (President)
Bush and Congress need to keep three important points in mind.
   _ Cut troops before anything else, but maintain enough strength
to protect American interests. (For example, cutting the 2.1
million active-duty personnel by 20 percent _ 420,000 troops _
would save about $12.5 billion alone in fiscal 1994). ...
   _ Don't be in a rush to weaken America's strategic capability.
...
   (D)espite the Soviet Union's paring of conventional forces, its
massive nuclear arsenal remains largely intact. ... (T)he United
States should avoid excessively deep cuts, because nuclear systems
tend to be a relatively cheap form of security.
   _ Don't cut research and development. The R&amp;D portion of the
defense budget _ less than 5 percent _ is arguably the best defense
investment the taxpayers can make. Even as Bush and Congress agree
to slash procurement for this and that weapon system, they must
make sure not to jeopardize America's lead in the technology of
warfare.

   Watertown (Wis.) Daily Times on medical research:
   A study published in the ... Journal of the American Medical
Association is being hailed for showing for the first time
scientifically that being fit helps women live longer. In addition,
the study, on the lives of 10,244 men and 3,120 women, who have
been followed for eight to 18 years, was called persuasive
confirmation of earlier ones.
   On review, the figures and conclusions seem unimpressive. Of the
13,444 enrolled for investigation between 1970 and 1981 by
epidemiologist Steven Blair of the Institute of Aerobics Research
in Dallas, only 283 have so far died. That's a death rate of 21.2
per 1,000.
   It is not a large enough figure compiled over a long enough time
to demonstrate that those ``least fit,'' regardless of how this is
defined, are for men at 240 percent greater risk of dying and for
women 360 percent than those ``most fit'' in the long run.
   Agreed that this is true for the sample tested. Nonetheless, it
pushes statistics to the limits to say, as does William Haskell,
``This is a major study.'' In 20 years it may be but not yet.
   Dr. Haskell, a cardiologist at the Stanford University School of
Medicine and an expert in exercise physiology, acted as a
consultant to the Aerobics Institute.
   Fads exist in medical research as in other fields. We have an
impression that this is true of exercise physiology. Exercising and
keeping fit are certainly important, but other things in medicine
as well as in our culture and society are even more so.

<HEAD>President's Son Denies Political Influence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's son Neil said he was never
asked to use his influence with regulators _ and would never have
agreed to do so _ in his three years as director of a Colorado
savings and loan that has since collapsed.
   A former federal bank regulator charged last week that
government officials delayed closing Silverado Savings and Loan
largely because the younger Bush was on the board of the
Denver-based thrift.
   But Neil Bush, who resigned from the board last year, says he
was never asked to influence regulators, according to today's San
Francisco Chronicle.
   ``Nor would I have if I had been asked,'' he said.
   Last week, James Moroney, a former staff analyst for the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Topeka, which supervised Silverado, said Bush's
presence was ``a material part of unconscionable delays in taking
over Silverado.''
   However, Moroney said he has no evidence that Bush exerted
direct pressure for preferential treatment.
   Asked if he thought his presence on Silverado's board influenced
regulators, Bush said: ``I wouldn't know. ... You would have to ask
regulators about that.''
   Bush, 34, stepped down from Silverado's board in August 1988,
immediately after the S&amp;L reported it was $200 million in the red
and four months before the state of Colorado took control of it.
   He told the Chronicle he resigned before his father's acceptance
of the Republican presidential nomination to ``avoid any appearance
of conflict of interest.'' Neither his father nor his father's
advisers pressured him to leave, Bush said.
   Regulators attributed Silverado's failure to ``substantial
dissipation of assets due to alleged violations of laws, rules and
regulations.'' The federal bailout of Silverado may cost taxpayers
$1 billion or more.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is examining the case to
determine whether to sue Silverado's officers and directors.
   Many analysts, including Colorado S&amp;L Commissioner David Paul,
attributed Silverado's collapse to a switch from traditional home
mortgages in favor of riskier securities.
   Bush, however, disagreed. ``My view is the institution had
acquired a portfolio of assets that suffered from a terrible,
depressed economy, not just in Denver, but throughout the
Southwest,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senior Citizens Find Dead End in Search for Free Turkey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKOGEE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of senior citizens who heard that
free turkeys were available at the county courthouse packed a
courtroom waiting for the judge to tell them where to get the free
birds.
   Turkeys, gift certificates and good baskets were to be handed
out by a Boynton millionaire, they said. But there was no such
millionaire in the Muskogee County courthouse Tuesday.
   And there were no free turkeys.
   ``The court adjourned and all those people looked at him ... and
looked at him,'' Judge Lyle Burris' secretary, who asked not to be
identified, said Wednesday. ``He said, `People you can leave now,'
but they wanted to know where to sign up. They were extremely
upset, to say the least.''
   Officials are sketchy on how the rumor got started, but it
appears to be linked to a bond hearing Burris was conducting for
Oklahoma American Veterans News. The Tulsa World reported that the
group had advertised on radio for their supporters to go to the
courtroom.
   Somehow, the message got misconstrued, officials said.
   ``They announced that if we would be at the courthouse at 2:30
we would receive a free turkey and a food basket,'' Cora Harmon
said.
   Burris' secretary said court officials were confused when about
50 senior citizens began milling around the hallways.
   Temperatures were in the 20s on Tuesday.
   ``At first I was surprised, and then I got mad,'' Court Clerk
Nadina Harnage said. ``I think it was tragic that all these people
had to get out in the cold, especially when someone told me they
paid $5 cab fare. It broke my heart.''

   The BBC will teach Polish broadcasters Western
radio and television techniques as part of Britain's $80 million
aid package, it was announced Wednesday.
   ``It's difficult to believe that it was as recently as 1987 that
deliberate interference with our Polish broadcasts ceased,'' said
BBC World Service Managing Director John Tusa.
   Thirty-six broadcasters, chosen by Polish Radio and Television,
will begin six-week training programs starting in February, Tusa
said. The BBC also will set up a training studio in Warsaw for
journalists who don't speak English.
   The BBC has proposed a similar training program for Hungary,
Tusa said.
   The fund was authorized by Parliament in June following Polish
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's visit to Britain.

<HEAD>Children Bring in Baby Pictures in Anti-Porn Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children recruited into a war on pornography are
turning in their bare-bottomed baby pictures, a newspaper said
Wednesday.
   Primary school students confused by the campaign's slogan _
``Sweep the Yellow'' _ also are coming to school prepared to sweep
streets and turning in yellow-covered books from their parents'
bookcases, the official China Youth News said. ``Yellow'' ususally
refers to pornographic material.
   The ``yellow calamity has spread unchecked and has seriously
harmed the spirit of our youth,'' the newspaper said. ``But this
reporter feels that this campaign should not involve elementary
school students.''
   The report said some young pupils, told by teachers to turn in
pornographic publications, asked what pornography was and were told
it was pictures of people not wearing clothes.
   Some obediently handed in their own baby pictures. Others
brought in copies of Baby Pictorial, a magazine for young people,
apparently because it had photos of naked infants.
   ``The teacher did not know whether to laugh or cry,'' the
newspaper said.
   It said even some teachers were not clear what qualified as
pornographic literature and some students searched their homes for
any books with a yellow cover.
   Other pupils, told they were being organized into squads that
would take to the streets Sunday to ``Sweep the Yellow,'' prepared
themselves for a day of street-cleaning.
   The official media carried similar reports this fall, citing
cases of parents going out and buying pornographic books so their
children could meet school quotas. One writer related that
booksellers in his town were happy with their good sales of
pornographic books and that children exchanged the books and read
them with curiosity before handing them in.
   Other children reportedly were bringing in calendars with
pictures of female movie stars or any magazine with a woman's
picture on the cover.
   Authorities have confiscated millions of books, magazines and
videos since the anti-pornography campaign began in August,
destroying some in public burnings.
   The banned books include works by dissident Fang Lizhi and other
critics of the government who have been blamed for the
pro-democracy protests _ what the government calls the
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' _ of this spring.
   The drive recently has been expanded into a campaign against
prostitution, gambling, drugs, abduction and selling of women and
children, and profiteering from superstition.

   The keeper of U.S. aviation
records has confirmed the first certified human-powered helicopter
flight by a super-lightweight craft built by a group of university
students.
   ``We are satisfied it was not a jump start, but a bona fide
hover,'' said Malvern Gross, president of the National Aeronautic
Association in Washington, D.C. The NAA certified the feat Tuesday.
   The Da Vinci III, designed and built by engineering students at
California Polytechnic State University, had a 6.8-second flight
Sunday that was observed by NAA consultant Thomas R. Stuelpnagel.
   Cyclist Greg McNeil pedaled Da Vinci III hard enough to raise it
eight inches off the ground.
   The flight was no fluke and won't be the end of the school's
development of human-powered aircraft, Cal Poly spokesman Bob
Anderson said. ``They're already talking about building Da Vinci IV
when they get back from vacation.''
   The 97-pound, 100-foot-long Da Vinci III was built of space-age
materials, including carbon graphite. It flew on Nov. 12 and Nov.
27, but no NAA observers were present.

   Food aid is pouring into Angola's
southwestern provinces of Huila, Namibe and Cunene, where rural
populations have been hit hard by a four-month drought, the state
news agency reported Wednesday.
   Deputy Minister of Agriculture Isaac dos Anjos said the lack of
rain since September has claimed the lives of an undetermined
number of villagers who have been forced to wander the largely arid
provinces in search of food and water, the news agency ANGOP said.
   September is normally the beginning of a rainy season.
   Herds of cattle have died and fields of basic crops such as corn
and beans also have been destroyed by wild animals scavenging for
food, ANGOP reported.
   The European Community, the United Nations Development Program
and other food aid organizations have sent 45,000 tons of cereals
and other emergency foodstuffs to the region, the agency said.

   A 12-year-old boy accused of shooting his
10-year-old friend has been charged with negligent homicide.
   Jeffery Fernando Miller was shot once in the chest Monday night
and his friend, unidentified because of his age, was taken into
custody Tuesday and turned over to juvenile authorities, police
said.
   Fred Warner, a deputy police chief, said the children had been
playing with an unloaded pistol.
   ``The investigation revealed that the 12-year-old had a pistol
and he was pulling the trigger pointing at different people,''
Warner said. ``There were seven children in the house ranging in
age from 7 to 14.''
   Warner said the 12-year-old put a bullet in the pistol and
pulled the trigger twice while pointing it at other children. The
third time, the gun fired and Miller was shot, he said.
   Warner said police do not know where the 12-year-old got the gun.
   The killing was the third fatal shooting by a juvenile in
Memphis since Thanksgiving. No charges were filed in the other two
incidents.

   A man who had complained a pack of dogs
recently attacked him was fatally mauled, apparently by the same
animals, authorities said.
   ``He appeared to have been eaten alive. That's the only way to
describe it,'' said Dill Delaney, a ranch caretaker who discovered
the body.
   The body of Ray Johnson, 69, was found on a road Tuesday near a
ranch where the mixed-breed dogs lived. Johnson frequently walked
eight miles from his house to another ranch where he tended hogs
and cattle.
   If the dogs were responsible for Johnson's death, criminal
charges could be brought against their owner, authorities said.
   John Slough, an off-duty San Diego police officer who lives
nearby, heard ``one hellacious dog fight'' Tuesday morning and went
to investigate, said San Diego police investigator Pete Solomonsen,
who is married to a niece of Johnson.
   When Slough arrived, two dogs attacked and he shot one to death
and wounded another, authorities said.
   Animal control officers impounded at least six dogs from the
ranch.
   Solomonsen said he signed a complaint a few months ago charging
that Johnson had been attacked by the dogs. Last week, he said,
Johnson showed him a pair of jeans torn by the dogs and had bite
marks on his legs.

   The United States will put up $200 million
toward a $500 million temporary loan for Poland as it awaits
economic help from the International Monetary Fund, the White House
announced today.
   Other, unspecified countries will contribute the remainder of
the funds, said deputy presidential press secretary Stephen Hart.
   He said the U.S. participation ``reflects support for Poland's
economic reform program designed to restore sustained growth.''
   Hart described the package as a short-term bridge loan, separate
from a $1 billion, multi-nation stabilization fund for Poland.
   The United States is contributing a $200 million grant to the
stabilization fund, intended to help put Poland's currency on a
sound footing.
   The loan, expected to run no more than six months, would be tied
to Poland's acceptance of conditions set by the IMF for a broader
assistance program.
   The United States would be repaid by Poland from money from the
IMF program and anticipated loans from the World Bank.
   Separately, Bush signed a bill last month providing $938 million
in assistance for Poland and Hungary over three years. Most of the
money is earmarked for Poland.

   Petty Officer Kendall Truitt said today his
onetime friend and shipmate, Clayton Hartwig, did not cause the
explosion aboard the USS Iowa that killed 47 sailors.
   Testifying for the first time since the April 19 blast, Truitt
told members of the House Armed Services subcommittee on
investigations that the Navy's conclusion Hartwig probably caused
the explosion was ``ridiculous.''
   ``It's a big coverup, in my opinion,'' Truitt said.
   Hartwig did not know he was going to be the gunner's mate the
day of the explosion, raising doubts about whether he could have
planned the blast, Truitt said.
   In addition, the gunpowder had been stored in high heat and the
cans were not airtight, creating an explosion hazard, Truitt said.
   ``Clayton Michael Hartwig did not cause the explosion. I do not
think he committed suicide. I believe the report is very
misleading,'' Truitt said in his opening statement.
   Earlier in the hearing, a Naval Investigative Service official
said he made a mistake in waiting several weeks before entering the
inquiry into the Iowa explosion.
   ``It was my decision. I made the wrong decision,'' Robert Powers
told the House Armed Services subcommittee on investigations as the
panel held its second day of hearings on the battleship blast.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of the panel,
questioned why it took the NIS until May 8 before it began its work
on the April 19 explosion.
   ``An awful lot of the evidence was thrown overboard by the time
you fellows got there on May 8,'' Mavroules said, his voice rising
in anger.
   ``There's no question about that,'' Powers responded.
   In his defense, Powers said the Navy initially considered the
explosion an accident, not a criminal act, and did not believe it
was necessary to call in the NIS, although the agency did offer to
help.
   Powers also said evidence was lost when sailors flooded gun
turret No. 2, where the explosion took place, to put out the fire
and later when the cleanup effort took place.
   ``The crime scene was vastly contaminated, no matter who was
going to investigate,'' Powers said.
   ``It would have been better if you had been there April 20,''
Mavroules said. Powers agreed.
   The Navy, in its Sept. 7 report, concluded that Hartwig,
depicted in psychological profiles as a suicidal loner, ``most
likely'' caused the blast by inserting some type of detonator
between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inch guns.
   In testimony Tuesday, Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who oversaw
the Navy inquiry, said he was convinced that conclusion would
``stand up in a court of law.''
   But Milligan added that he cannot blame the 24-year-old gunner's
mate beyond a shadow of a doubt because Hartwig and all the
witnesses died in the explosion.
   However, Dr. Richard C. Froede, the armed forces medical
examiner who performed the autopsies on the sailors, told the House
panel he has not changed his opinion that the deaths were
accidental.
   ``As of this day, it has not changed,'' Froede said. ``I only
would make a change when I had more proof and all the
investigations were over.''

<TEXT>
   Federal immigration authorities today levied a
record $580,000 fine on a South Carolina textile company accused of
hiring scores of illegal aliens, including a 12-year-old boy.
   The administrative fine on Piedmont Quilting Corp. of Walhalla,
S.C., is the largest under the 1986 law that contains criminal and
civil penalties for knowingly employing illegal aliens, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service said.
   One INS official said working conditions for three children
``almost bordered on bondage.''
   The agency's announcement came a day after the company and 11
officers and managers were indicted in Greenville, S.C., on federal
criminal charges related to the hiring of 117 illegal aliens from
Mexico and Peru.
   The administrative fine covers the employment of 85 illegal
aliens, including a 12-year-old boy, INS said. The fine also covers
the company's failure to comply with procedures to verify that more
than 400 employees were not illegal aliens, it said.
   ``This is in defiance of the congressional mandate to prevent
illegal aliens form obtaining employment in this country,'' INS
Commissioner Gene McNary said in a statement.
   McNary said the agency's action ``should be a clear sign to
those who have any doubts that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service is strongly committed to enforcing the employer sanctions''
in the 1986 law.
   The criminal charges resulted from a six-month investigation of
conditions at the company that included placement of an INS
undercover agent as a plant employee, said Thomas P. Fischer,
director of the agency's district office in Atlanta.
   When INS agents raided the plant last July 17, they found three
Mexican boys, two aged 15 and another 12, working on the plant,
Fischer said in a telephone interview.
   ``It almost bordered on bondage when you look at the age of
these people,'' he said. ``They were being paid in cash, there was
no documentation.''
   The indictment filed Tuesday charged that Piedmont Quilting
knowingly hired and recruited illegal aliens for employment,
Assistant U.S. Attorney David Stephens said Tuesday in Greenville.
   Indicted on that charge were company owner Alfred Mizhir, 55;
his wife, Gail Mizhir, 30, both of Spring Lake, N.J.; and nine
other individuals, including several Hispanic legal employees of
the plant.
   Piedmont Quilting's attorney has said the illegal aliens
presented the company with false documentation in order to get
hired.
   Federal agents raided the company last July in what was called
the biggest crackdown on the employment of illegal aliens outside
south Florida.
   The indictment also includes 117 counts of harboring illegal
aliens. Those charges are against the company, its owners and the
same individuals named in the first count.
   Two additional counts charge the company, its owners and plant
employees Eugene Scarpa of Greenville and Mary Hill of Seneca,
S.C., with making false statements on quarterly wage reports.
   Establishing a practice of hiring illegal aliens carries a
maximum fine of $3,000 per alien plus six months' imprisonment,
Stephens said.
   The penalty for harboring illegal aliens and for making false
statements on quarterly reports is up to five years imprisonment
and $250,000 in fines per count, he said.

   A fire official, testifying today at the
trial of a man charged in a fiery bus crash that killed 27 people,
said today that polyurethane foam seat cushions like those on the
vehicle are deadly when burned.
   Maj. William H. Lilly of the Lexington Fire Department took the
stand for the defense at the murder trial of Larry Mahoney, 36, of
Worthville, Ky., who was driving a pickup that smashed head-on with
the church bus in May 1988.
   Mahoney is charged with 27 counts of murder as well as drunken
driving and other offenses. His attorneys, whose tactic has been to
question the bus' safety, said Mahoney may be called to tell his
story.
   Today, defense attorney William Summers asked Lilly if he was
aware that the polyurethane foam seat cushions on the bus were
hazardous when burned.
   ``Basically, I know that polyurethane foam is dangerous and will
kill you, yes sir,'' Lilly replied.
   Under cross examination by Assistant Attorney General Paul
Richwalsky Jr., Lilly said the polyurethane cushions are commonly
found in vehicles and hotel furniture. Richwalsky asked if the seat
of fire trucks contain that material.
   ``Probably the same thing we're talking about here,'' Lilly said.
   In testimony Tuesday, Eugene Sober, a NASA fire safety engineer,
said that many of the 24 youngsters and three adults killed in the
fiery bus crash could have survived if the seats were fire
resistant.
   Also on the witness stand Tuesday, the 13th day of testimony,
was former Ford Motor Co. Vice President Thomas Feaheny, who said
existing technology could have prevented the fire.
   Judge Charles Satterwhite did not permit Feaheny to provide
details about technology he said might have prevented the fire.
   But Feaheny told reporters during a recess that a plastic gas
tank on the Radcliff First Assembly of God church bus would have
prevented the fire and saved the lives of many of those who died.
   He handed out copies of reports he provided to the National
Transportation Safety Board during a 1988 hearing about the crash.
   ``What you see in these reports is the technology has existed
for over 10 years that could have prevented this tragedy even in an
accident of this sort,'' Feaheny said. ``And Ford Motor Co. has
suppressed that technology and continues to do so to this date in a
rather giant cover-up.''
   Ford rejected the claim and said Feaheny, fired by the company
in 1983 and since involved in a failed lawsuit against Ford
executives, had an ax to grind.
   ``The suggestion that a plastic fuel tank would have prevented
the Carrollton tragedy is gross speculation at best,'' said John
Jelinek, a Ford spokesman. ``Mr. Feaheny's assertion that Ford
Motor Co. has suppressed plastic fuel tank technology is obviously
contrary to the facts.''
   In his cross-examination, prosecutor Paul Richwalsky Jr. sought
to show that Feaheny lacked direct experience with Ford buses.
Feaheny insisted he was qualified to discuss the issue based on 30
years in the automotive industry.
   Sober, a fire safety expert, testified that the seat cushions
were made of flexible polyurethane foam, and seat coverings of
polychlorinated vinyl.
   ``Flexible polyurethane foam is the single largest class of
fuels involved with fatal fires,'' he said.
   When burned, the untreated foam emits hydrogen cyanide gas and
the plastic emits hydrogen chloride gas, he said. Both can be fatal
after a typical bus seat burns for just a few minutes, he said.
   Foam treated with fire retardant was ``readily available'' to
the automotive industry when the school bus was manufactured in
1977, he said, and seats treated with fire retardant would have
saved lives in the crash.

<HEAD>North Says Not Sure That Poindexter Destroyed Finding</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 15 grafs new with North testimony; picks up at pvs 8th graf,
`John Poindexter;' deletes last 7 grafs to tighten</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Oliver L. North testified today ``I don't know
for a fact'' that former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter tore up a politically embarrassing policy statement that
depicted the Reagan administration's Iran initiative as a straight
arms-for-hostages deal.
   North said his memory of the event was colored by the fact that
Poindexter acknowledged in congressional testimony in 1987 that he
had destroyed the presidential document, known as a ``finding,'' on
Nov. 20, 1986 amid public scrutiny of the administration's arms
sales to Iran.
   The former national security council aide testified at a
pre-trial hearing where Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler, tried
to demonstrate that North was tainted by Poindexter's immunized
testimony to Congress and therefore should not testify as a
government witness.
   Under a 1972 Supreme Court ruling, the government may make no
use of a defendant's testimony compelled under a limited grant of
immunity. That includes testimony given by other witnesses who may
have been influenced by the immunized statements.
   The presidential finding ``could have been any sheet of paper
but for the fact that'' Poindexter ``confirmed it'' in his
immunized congressional testimony, North told Beckler.
   ``I don't know for a fact ... that the document destroyed that
morning was the finding,'' North said later when questioned by
Iran-Contra prosecutor Michael Bromwich.
   North testified at his own trial last April that he watched
Poindexter rip up the document as then-Attorney General Edwin Meese
III began focusing on a November 1985 CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles to Iran.
   Today, however, North said that he hadn't actually read the
document at the time Poindexter destroyed it.
   The destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminal
charges against Poindexter, who is accused of falsely telling
Congress that he didn't learn of the missile shipment to Iran until
January 1986.
   The finding, signed by President Reagan in December 1985, was
drafted because of the CIA-assisted shipment the previous month.
   Poindexter is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 22 on charges of
conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of
making false statements in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   On Tuesday, North said he was unable to remember details of
meetings with his ex-boss, even though the now-convicted Reagan
aide testified about those meetings at his own trial.
   ``It's difficult to get answers out of this witness,'' declared
U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene, who said he would give
prosecutors the ``widest latitude'' in interrogating North.
   Questioned for five hours Tuesday by Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan
Webb, North repeatedly was shown transcripts of the testimony he
gave last April in which he referred to contacts with Poindexter.
   North refused to say that Poindexter had directed him to give
false statements when North denied to House Intelligence Committee
members that he had been assisting the Contras.
   ``John Poindexter felt as I did, that (he hoped) the right
questions'' wouldn't ``come up'' so that false answers wouldn't
have to be given, North said in connection with the Aug. 6, 1986
meeting in the White House Situation Room.
   North testified at his own trial that he felt like a ``pawn'' in
a chess game played by ``giants'' when, after a discussion with
Poindexter, he made the statements to the House committee.
   But North testified Tuesday that ``no one told me to'' make the
false statements.
   Webb suggested that the ``giants'' North referred to were
President Reagan, former national security adviser Robert McFarlane
and Poindexter.
   ``That is not what I said,'' retorted North. ``In general terms
I would say it was the executive and legislative branches of
government'' and included Secretary of State George Shultz, Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger and CIA director William Casey.

   More than 6,000 Vietnamese held in detention
centers Wednesday carried banners and chanted slogans denouncing
the involuntary return of 51 other boat people to Vietnam, a
government spokesman said.
   Some shouted they would rather die than return to Vietnam, local
radio and television stations reported.
   About 3,000 Vietnamese marched around the camp at the outlying
Hei Ling Chau island, a former leper colony, and another 3,000
demonstrated at Whitehead camp in the New Territories. About 300
staged a protest at the Chi Ma Wan center on the offshore Lantau
island.
   The demonstrations were peaceful and none lasted more than two
hours, government spokesman Lionel Rodrigues said.
   Hong Kong's chief secretary, Sir David Ford, defended the
involuntary repatriation of Vietnamese, saying the program will
continue despite international criticism.
   ``It is our intention to put into place a continuing program to
return to Vietnam all those who are judged not to be refugees,''
Chief Secretary Sir David Ford told the Legislative Council. His
speech did not include a timetable for further repatriation.
   In London, Foreign Office Minister Francis Maude said it could
take as long as two years to return all the Vietnamese, classified
as illegal immigrants. He said Britain could not delay just because
it makes other countries uncomfortable.
   ``It's all very well for others to say to us, `Can't you delay a
little bit longer?' but that plea has been made to us before,''
Maude told a parliamentary committee.
   Vietnam, in a commentary monitored in Bangkok, partly blamed
economic embargos imposed by non-Communist nations for causing its
citizens to flee.
   ``The policy of hostility and economic sanctions ... by some
countries against Vietnam over the past 10 years are one of the
reasons causing economic difficulties in Vietnam,'' it said. ``This
led to the fact that some people fled the country.''
   About 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into Hong Kong since
June 1988 are considered illegal immigrants unless they can prove
they fled their Communist homeland out of fear of persecution.
   Nearly 6,800 have been denied refugee status after being
screened by immigration officials, compared with slightly more than
700 who qualified.
   The first batch to be sent home against their will were whisked
screaming and crying from their detention center by riot police
before dawn Tuesday and put on a plane to Hanoi. Vietnam has
promised the returnees will be treated humanely and not punished,
the Hong Kong government says.
   It argues that returning the Vietnamese home is more humane than
keeping them indefinitely in the camps, which are overcrowded and
rife with violence and malnutrition.
   But human rights organizations, British opposition politicians
and the U.S. government have criticized the program. The U.S. State
Department expressed deep regret over the repatriations and said,
``British authorities should continue to grant asylum to all those
persons from Vietnam who seek it.''
   Ford responded that ``those who have been loudest in their
condemnation have been slowest in bringing forward practical
alternatives. We have returned no one who in the eyes of the
international community is a bona fide refugee.''
   He added: ``We do not look for the world's applause, but we are
entitled, I feel, to the world's understanding.''
   About 56,000 Vietnamese are housed in squalid camps. Those who
arrived before June 1988 automatically were granted refugee status
and are eligible for resettlement.
   China, which will assume control of the British colony in 1997,
has said it would like Hong Kong to resolve the Vietnamese refugee
issue before then.

<HEAD>Gun Charges Dismissed Against Miss West Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAY FORMANEK Jr. ^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FAIRMONT, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magistrate today dismissed charges Miss
West Virginia Lisa Bittinger illegally waved a gun at a woman who
kicked in her car window and pulled the beauty queen's hair during
a scuffle.
   ``I don't think it's unreasonable for a person to reach for a
weapon when she's being threatened,'' Magistrice C. Frank Jones
said in dismissing the charge of brandishing a weapon, which
carries up to six months in jail and a fine of $200.
   Tammy Boyce, 23, of Fairmont, had filed the complaint against
Bittinger, 21, after the Nov. 7 scuffle on a downtown street.
Bittinger said the fight began when Boyce ran her car off the road.
   Boyce, during a hearing today, admitted reaching through the
sunroof of Bittinger's car, pulling her hair and screaming at her.
Boyce said she backed off and kicked out the window after Bittinger
pulled a gun.
   Boyce admitted that Bittinger has been dating a former boyfriend
of hers but said that she had stopped dating him three years ago
and that he did not figure into the fight.
   A hearing was scheduled for later today on Bittinger's complaint
against Boyce on battery and destruction of property charges.
   The beauty queen came under fire remarks deemed racist by some
people earlier this year upon her return from the Miss America
pageant, at which she failed to make the top 10.
   ``If it's political, it's not my fault,'' she said. ``If you
look at the to 10, it's quite obvious. It was one black, one
Korean, one Japanese, one hearing impaired, one kidney transplant,
and of course Texas and Florida were part of the top 10. It makes
you wonder.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disastrous San Francisco earthquake and
the crumbling of the Berlin Wall were the recent news stories that
loomed largest for Americans, a poll shows.
   Nearly three-quarters of people surveyed said they ``followed
closely'' the stories about the San Francisco tremor, according to
the Times Mirror News Interest Index.
   The tumult surrounding the opening up of East Germany was
watched intently by half of those interviewed, the survey found.
   On the other hand, Americans showed little interest in stories
about the resumption of hostilities in Nicaragua and state and
local election coverage. Only 13 percent said they closely followed
those stories.
   The index was based on a telephone survey of 1,230 adults taken
between Nov. 9-12. The estimated margin of error is plus or minus 3
percentage points.
   Only the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger _ closely
watched by 80 percent of those surveyed _ attracted more attention
than the earthquake, officials said. The survey has been taken
regularly over the last four years.
   Despite the fact that the quake interrupted the World Series,
the survey found weak overall interest in that event, with 23
percent saying they followed the story.

<HEAD>Latest Damage Estimates from Hurricane Raised to Nearly $6 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BROOKS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent assessments from rural residences
and condominiums have raised damage estimates for South Carolina
from Hurricane Hugo to $5.9 billion.
   The increased estimate is up from the $4 billion preliminary
estimate reached in November by the state Office of Economic
Research.
   The new report, compiled by the same office, listed damage to
homes at nearly $3 billion as of Dec. 6. Damage in the budget
board's report, reflecting assessments through Oct. 27, listed
residential damage at only $539 million.
   Damage estimates of the agriculture industry, which includes
timber, remained unchanged at $1.4 billion.
   The agriculture industry is ``one of the hardest areas we're
going to have to get back on its feet,'' Gov. Carroll Campbell said
Tuesday during a meeting in which the report was released.
   The latest assessment was based on additional information from
the American Red Cross and county assessors and damage figures from
condominum complexes, the report said.
   The new estimate also includes $700 million in damage reported
by commercial and industrial enterprises that may have included
operating losses, said William C. Gillespie of the Division of
Research and Statistics.
   The report also listed the following damage estimates: $250
million for the Charleston Naval Base; $200 million for public and
private utilities; $150 million for government facilities; $125
million for automobiles; $50 million for Shaw Air Force Base, and
$13 million for the South Carolina Ports Authority.
   Insurance companies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the Small Business Administration and state agencies have already
issued $2.1 billion in aid to hurricane victims, Gillespie said.
   The report was issued to the Hugo Recovery Commission, an
eight-member panel appointed by Campbell to assess the economic
impact of the hurricane and its effect on agriculture, tourism,
forestry, education and the infrastructure.
   The commission is charged with recommending initiatives to
stimulate economic development and enhance industrial recruitment
and expansion in the wake of the storm. A report is due by early
March.
   Hugo killed 29 people in the state when it slammed into South
Carolina on Sept. 21.

   State officials touring a site under
consideration for a radioactive waste dump had to be escorted two
miles on foot today after demonstrators formed a human chain to pen
them in their cars, a protest leader said.
   Members of Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping also rushed
cars, trucks and tractors to block roads leading to the site after
field teams from the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission
and several sheriff's deputies arrived, said Taffy Rook, a
spokeswoman for the protest group.
   Sheriff Lee Price called off the tour and preliminary testing
about 11 a.m. because of the demonstrations, said Jeff Gebhardt,
co-chairman of the protest group.
   About 150 anti-dump protesters clustered around the commission's
two cars, preventing them from leaving the site, Gebhardt said.
After 30 minutes, one group of state workers abandoned their car
and were escorted off the site by deputies who said they would come
back for the others, he said.
   The wooded area is in a dairy region about 50 miles south of
Syracuse.
   Protesters also had staked out a second site under consideration
near Taylor in case teams went there.
   A dispatcher for the Sheriff's Department said no one was
available to comment because most personnel were at the site.
   Protesters had also camped out overnight at three potential dump
sites in Allegany County, preparing to block state officials from
beginning inspections and tests on land there. Authorities said
state officials were not in the county this morning.
   ``I hope that people don't go outside the law,'' commission
spokeswoman Susan Baranski said Tuesday. ``The courts have made it
clear that the commission has the right and responsibility to do
this.''
   Anti-dump groups in Allegany and Cortland counties have vowed to
prevent the testing at the proposed dump sites, saying their
protests would be nonviolent but that they expected arrests.
   ``There will be civil disobedience,'' said Sally Campbell of the
Allegany County Nonviolent Action Group. ``Whatever they try to do
we're going to be out there to stop them from doing it.''
   The five sites were chosen by the commission in September. Under
federal law, states must have a place to store low-level
radioactive waste by 1993.
   The commission plans to complete soil testing and other
evaluations by spring. It will then narrow down the number of sites
to two or three for more comprehensive tests.

   People with AIDS can use their computer
terminals to learn about the latest treatments for their illness or
chat with others who have the disease, under a federally funded
program developed here.
   Patients also can ask nurses about condoms and other health
topics anonymously and use a computer databank to help them make
decisions on insurance, housing, transportation and other matters,
the program's developer said Tuesday.
   Patricia Brennan, an associate professor of nursing and systems
engineering at Case Western Reserve University, said she knew of no
other project of its type in the country. The program is funded by
a $600,000 three-year grant from the National Institute of Health.
   ``It's not so much how to take care of their illness as how to
deal with day-to-day living ... how to get a bus schedule, how to
prepare snacks. It also guides someone through decision-making,
such as where to live or whether to take a new drug,'' Ms. Brennan
said.
   The experimental system is linked to a databank and transmission
system called Cleveland Free-Net, a free, community-access network.
   More specialized information on acquired immune deficiency
syndrome is on an electronic bulletin board of AIDS data and
information-sharing, accessible only to the AIDS patients, Ms.
Brennan said. Users may remain anonymous, she said.
   Twenty AIDS patients selected under the project have used the
service in the past year, Ms. Brennan said.
   The program is entering its second phase, which will involve 50
AIDS patients and compare the effectiveness of the computer system
with the more conventional use of the telephone, Ms. Brennan said.
   The AIDS computer system is not commercially available, but Ms.
Brennan said she hopes it will be ``a springboard.''
   The decision-making aspect is one of the system's unique
features, Ms. Brennan said. It lists a series of questions and
considerations to help a person decide how to travel, whether to
buy a car or where to live.
   Ms. Brennan said she is especially interested in patients' use
of the system to ``talk'' to one another via computer.
   ``One of the biggest problems is fatigue, even with people who
aren't physically very ill,'' she said. ``We have people who may
have enough energy to get to work but they're exhausted the rest of
the evening. So the network allows them to make social contacts at
their own pace.''
   AIDS is a disease that attacks the human immune systems, leaving
victims vulnerable to a variety of diseases and tumors. It is
spread chiefly through sexual contact and sharing hypodermic
needles for drug use.
   Ms. Brennan said there were about 1,600 AIDS cases in Ohio as of
Dec. 4, with 409 cases in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland.

<TEXT>
   A paramedic says he was fired for
arranging to give away teddy bears to children being taken to the
hospital, but an ambulance service spokesman said today the firing
was related to job performance, not stuffed animals.
   Paramedic Chuck Brady Jr. was dismissed Nov. 28 and two other
paramedics were suspended by Kevin Raun, ambulance service director
for Apple Valley, Lakeville and Farmington.
   The three said they were told by Raun that they had circumvented
his authority when money was solicited for the teddy bears without
his knowledge. Beecham and Adams supported the idea but did not
actually solicit money, the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch
reported today.
   An American Legion post donated $1,000 to the paramedics' union
after an appeal from Brady, the St. Paul newspaper reported.
   Raun declined to comment on the matter, but Bill Holton,
chairman of the ambulance service board that upheld Brady's firing,
said the dismissal ``had nothing to do with the teddy bears.''
   ``The dismissal had to do with job performance,'' he said.
Holton would not give specifics of Brady's job performance.
   Holton said the ambulance company has in the past given away
stuffed animals to children being taken to hospitals. ``So, the
program by itself is a very good program and one we had intended to
do again this year,'' he said.
   Brady said that on his most recent job evaluation he received
satisfactory or above-average ratings and no negative remarks.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor says a two-year prison sentence
was appropriate for a man who slapped his 4-year-old son for
sniffing gasoline to get high.
   Richard Lewis Vardaman, 42, of Georgetown pleaded guilty to
battery and was sentenceed last week by Judge Cecil Tedder.
   ``It was a serious case of child abuse,'' Prosecutor Chris Raff
said Monday. ``It was not normal discipline. I think the proof
justified the sentence. The message is clear _ child abuse would
not be tolerated.''
   Defense attorney Bill Mills said the sentence was too harsh but
that his client probably won't appeal it.
   Vardaman caught his son and another boy sniffing gas from a can
near their home in May and paddled both boys, Mills said. But twice
the next day, Vardaman found his son sniffing gas, the defense
attorney said.
   ``He slapped him once on each side of the face that time,''
Mills said.
   Vardaman and his wife took the child to a hospital because the
boy was ``acting drunk,'' Mills said. The boy seemed normal by the
time they reached the hospital, but the emergency room nurse and a
doctor noticed the bruises on his face and contacted police.
   Photos of the boy taken at the hospital were shown to the judge.
``They looked pretty bad,'' Mills said. ``The child has a ruddy
complexion and his face was puffy in the picture.''
   Mills said a representative from the state Human Services
Department testified that it was an isolated case of abuse.

   The crew of the nuclear submarine
Tennessee successfully launched a Trident 2 missile Wednesday after
the Navy warned Greenpeace anti-nuclear protesters to stay out of
the safety zone, the Navy said.
   The launch was the second straight successful undersea
test-firing of the Navy's newest and deadliest nuclear weapon,
keeping it on track for operational deployment next March. Two of
the first three submarine tests failed explosively.
   The Tennessee was cruising submerged in the Atlantic about 50
miles offshore when the 44-foot, $26.5 million missile burst out of
a launch tube, broke the surface, ignited and hurled a dummy
warhead package to an undisclosed ocean target several thousand
miles away.
   The Navy reported several minutes after the 9:15 a.m. launch
that the test was successful.
   ``Another great day for the Navy,'' said Vice Admiral Roger F.
Bacon, commander of the Atlantic submarine fleet.
   A 60-foot Greenpeace ketch, the Mondeivitano, briefly penetrated
the launch safety zone but withdrew after a Navy ship warned it to
move away. As a precaution, six Coast Guard cutters patroled the
perimeter of the 5,000-yard safety area around the submarine.
   ``They observed the range safety warning,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Bill
Sonntag, a Navy spokesman.
   ``We made our point that we have a right to protest in
international waters,'' said Greenpeace spokeswoman Shannon Fagan.
``We will now take our fight to Congress in an effort to have this
missile system canceled. The world can no longer afford the waste
of precious resources on weapons of mass destruction like the
Trident 2.''
   Greenpeace protesters tried to halt a Trident 2 launch Dec. 4 by
sending the 190-foot vessel MV Greenpeace, with 25 aboard, into the
Tennessee's safety zone.
   A Navy ship intercepted the intruding vessel and damaged it by
repeatedly bumping it and using fire hoses to pour water down the
smokestacks, stopping the engines. Navy sailors in swift boats
corraled two Greenpeace high-speed rafts that tried to approach the
Tennessee, cut their fuel lines and towed them out of the safety
zone.
   Greenpeace had halted a Trident 2 test with the same tactics in
July.
   A motor nozzle system, blamed for the two failures of the
Trident 2, has been redesigned and the Navy is accelerating the
test schedule, aiming to have the Trident ready for patrols by
March.
   The Tennessee will be the first of 24 subs to go to sea, each
with 24 of the weapons. The Trident 2 is capable of hurling as many
as 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets more than 4,600 miles
away.

<HEAD>Young Man Who Died Gives 7 Organs To 6 People</HEAD>

   Six people were recovering today from
transplant surgery after doctors gave them seven organs from the
same donor.
   ``This is the first we've ever done with the two lungs, heart,
liver, kidneys and pancreas,'' said Susan Kuslis, clinical director
of the California Transplant Donor Network, which coordinates organ
recovery for five northern California transplant centers.
   The donor's identity and cause of death were not released to
protect the grieving family. Storms of publicity surrounding
successful transplants tend to discourage family members from
authorizing organ donations, Kuslis said.
   The extraordinary donation was possible in part because the
donor was in good health, she said.
   Four of the recipients were listed in serious but stable
condition at Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center. The two others
were reported in critical but stable condition at Stanford
University Medical Center.
   Although donations of three and even four organs are not
unusual, fewer than 1 percent of organ donations nationwide have
involved seven organs given to different people, said Wanda Bond, a
spokeswoman for the United Network for Organ Sharing, which
administers organ procurement nationally. Record keeping began Oct.
1, 1987, she said.
   ``For all the organs to be viable and that every one had a
match, that's terrific,'' said Bond.
   Factors that determine matches include blood and tissue types,
organ size, distances between donor and possible recipient and the
medical conditions of patients, Bond said.
   Hearts and lungs must be recovered and transplanted within about
four hours, experts said. Kidneys can last up to 72 hours and must
be offered nationally in an effort to find the best genetic match,
but recipients were also found locally.
   At Stanford, one of the donor's lungs helped a woman who had
been awaiting a transplant for a year; the other lung went to a
woman who had spent five years with a lethal lung disease.
   The donor's heart went to a 60-year-old San Francisco man
suffering from terminal cardiac disease, and one of his kidneys
aided a 35-year-old man with end-stage renal disease, Pacific
Presbyterian spokeswoman Julie Murray said.
   His other kidney and his pancreas went to a 34-year-old Berkeley
woman with diabetes and renal failure, Murray said. The liver went
to a 38-year-old woman from Tacoma, Wash., whose own liver had
failed, she said.

   Paul McCartney admits that he sometimes gets
choked up while performing Beatles' songs on his current tour,
which is a kind of magical history tour featuring more than a dozen
Fab Four songs.
   ``It really feels good playing those songs,'' McCartney said
Tuesday at a news conference at Madison Square Garden, where he is
in the midst of a four-night stand.
   Because the Beatles stopped performing live in 1966, he said,
``It's really nice to get back to those songs 'cause they're fresh,
for me anyway.''
   And occasionally a memory _ especially of John Lennon, his
songwriting partner who was slain in 1980 _ sneaks up on him.
   ``That kind of thing happens, yeah, occasionally you just get a
little choker,'' said McCartney, 47.
   The Beatles' hits affect the audience the same way, he said.
   ``You see people in the audience, kind of my age, like with kids
and stuff. And you see grown men crying and stuff. I mean, there's
a lot of emotion,'' he said.

   Bass guitarist John Taylor of the British rock
group Duran Duran was banned from driving for 12 months and fined
the equivalent of $400 Wednesday after he admitted drinking and
driving.
   Prosecutor Debbie Churaman told Horseferry Magistrates Court
that Taylor was stopped on his way home early Tuesday by police who
saw him speeding and driving erratically through London.
   Taylor's lawyer, Nicholas Price, said the 29-year-old musician
had worked until midnight Monday and had eaten nothing except a
sandwich before driving to a party.
   ``I have been very irresponsible,'' Taylor, 29, said after the
court appearance. ``It's no use blaming anybody else. You know what
you are doing, and that's it. It was down to me.''

   A survey indicates the nation's most popular
celebrity is actor Mel Gibson and the least liked is
actor-director-writer Woody Allen, Spy magazine claims.
   It said 450 randomly selected respondents around the nation were
surveyed by telephone for Spy's one-hour television special, ``How
to be Famous,'' scheduled in early 1990 on NBC.
   The magazine said the best-liked celebrities after Gibson were
Tom Selleck, Bob Hope, Paul Newman, Eddie Murphy, John Wayne,
Lucille Ball tied with Bill Cosby and Dolly Parton, and Clint
Eastwood.
   But it claims Miss Parton also showed on the least-like list.
Those celebrities, after Allen, were Jane Fonda, Pee-Wee Herman,
Don Rickles tied with Joan Rivers, Zsa Zsa Gabor tied with Miss
Parton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, Johnny Carson, and Roseanne Barr
tied with Madonna.

   Legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa,
whose movies have influenced other films from ``Star Wars'' to
spaghetti westerns, will be the first filmmaker from Japan to
receive an honorary Oscar, it was reported.
   Kurosawa, 79, whose 1951 movie ``Rashomon'' earned him his first
of three Academy Awards, will receive the honorary award during the
62nd Annual Academy Awards ceremony on March 26, the Hollywood
Reporter said in Tuesday's edition.
   His film ``Seven Samurai'' was remade as ``The Magnificent
Seven,'' while ``Yojimbo'' was reworked into ``A Fistful of
Dollars,'' a so-called spaghetti western filmed in Italy. U.S.
director-producer George Lucas acknowledges Kurosawa's ``The Hidden
Fortress'' was a major inspiration for ``Star Wars.''

   Former President Reagan says the United States
should not reduce military expenditures in reaction to Eastern
Europe's changes, even though he supports Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's efforts at reform.
   At a luncheon Tuesday, he was asked if the United States
shouldn't take advantage of the changing politics in the world to
divert some of the money spent on the military.
   ``We're still behind them,'' he said, referring to Soviet
military might. He said the Soviets must reduce their war machine
``before we start nibbling away at something that has so far made
us successful in our relationship (with the U.S.S.R.).''
   About 1,600 attended the Seafirst Bank annual luncheon. Reagan
reportedly was paid $50,000 for his 20-minute talk, followed by 25
minutes of questions.

   ``City of Angels,'' which opened Monday, canceled Wednesday's
matinee and evening performances because one of its stars, Gregg
Edelman, had laryngitis. He is expected back Thursday, spokesman
Bill Evans said.
   The musical, a parody of 1940s Hollywood detective movies,

<TEXT>
   The 700 secret police who were designated
to read other people's mail have been reassigned, and telephone
tapping has been virtually banned, the Solidarity-led government
announced Wednesday.
   The mail-reading unit was closed and its positions are among
1,800 in the Interior Ministry that were most recently transferred
to the regular police force, said spokeswoman Malgorzata
Niezabitowska.
   The police counterintelligence unit also has been cut, by 150
jobs, to a ``necessary minimum,'' she said.
   Previous cuts to the secret police force, including elimination
of the department that monitored churches and religious
organizations, freed up 7,000 jobs for crime fighting, she said.
   New regulations ban installing bugging devices except ``in
extraordinary circumstances, every time with the approval of the
Interior Minister,'' Ms. Niezabitowska said at a news conference.
   ``You are not on this list, unless you work for an intelligence
service,'' she told her audience of foreign correspondents.
   The 8,800 Interior Ministry positions were transferred to the
police forces, but there are still 12,000 vacancies in the regular
police, the spokeswoman said.
   The dismantling of the secret police and shifting resources to
the regular police force for crime-fighting were key priorities of
the government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   The Interior Ministry still is run by a Communist, Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczek, but he has cooperated in the change of priorities and
announced the disbanding of the ZOMO riot police who had symbolized
government suppression of dissent.
   Poor pay and low public esteem have cut the ranks of the police
force, according to authorities who also report a rapid rise in
crime.
   Gen. Zenon Trzcinski, the militia's chief commander, said this
week the burglary rate has grown the most, from 40,000 in 1979 to
100,000 in 1988 and an estimated 150,000 this year.

<HEAD>Strains Easing Between U.S., Mexican Agents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A top Drug Enforcement Administration official
says the strain between U.S. drug agents and Mexican officials
stemming from the 1985 killing of DEA agent Enrique Camarena has
been eased by Mexico's prosecution of those involved.
   ``I think we've seen very positive signs from the new
administration (in Mexico) since last December, particularly the
president,'' Acting Deputy DEA Administrator Terrence Burke said in
an interview.
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office a
year ago, has made vigorous efforts to change his country's image
as a haven for drug dealers and corruption by jailing traffickers,
arresting corrupt officials and seizing tons of drugs.
   The successful prosecution and sentencing in Mexico of Rafael
Caro Quintero, 37; Ernesto Rafael Fonseca Carrillo, 56; and 10
other men involved in the killings of Camarena and Mexican pilot
Alfredo Zavala Avelar has boosted DEA confidence that those charged
in Mexico will be brought to justice, Burke said.
   ``I think this is an extremely positive sign,'' Burke said after
Caro Quintero, Fonseca and the others were sentenced Tuesday to 40
years for their roles in the killings. Prison time for related
convictions brought Caro Quintero's total sentence to 116 years and
Fonseca's to 144.
   Fernando Arias, a spokesman for Mexican Attorney General Enrique
Alvarez del Castillo, said Caro Quintero and Fonseca would have to
serve 74 and 53 years respectively because of time remaining from
previous sentences.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday that
the United States is ``pleased that those responsible for these
brutal murders have been brought to justice.''
   ``These convictions further demonstrate the resolve of the
Salinas administration in its fight against drug trafficking,''
Boucher said. ``We look forward to continued cooperation of the
Mexican government in the battle against this common threat to the
national security and well-being of both our countries.''
   The U.S. support of Mexican actions follows years of tension
illustrated by U.S. contentions that Mexican authorities had
allowed Caro Quintero to escape to Costa Rica, where he was
captured. In an effort to pressure the Mexican government for
action, the U.S. Customs Service virtually blocked the border by
conducting full searches of all Mexicans trying to enter the United
States.
   It was revealed in July that Caro Quintero and Fonseca had
bribed Mexico City prison officials to let them live in luxury
accommodations they had built inside the prison. The two were then
transferred to maximum-security facilities.
   Camarena, 37, was kidnapped Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara; Zavala
Avelar was kidnapped a few days later. Their bullet-riddled bodies,
showing signs of torture, were found March 5, 1985, wrapped in
plastic bags and buried in shallow graves on a ranch 60 miles
southeast of Guadalajara.
   The Camarena killing ``was from the beginning and has continued
to remain'' a highly emotional issue for DEA agents, said Burke.
The DEA never pulled back in Mexico, even immediately after the
Camarena killing, he said.
   ``We did just the opposite,'' he said. ``We sent additional
agents in and our signal at that time was, `You kill a DEA agent
and we'll hound you to the grave'.''
   ``We're just continuing to move ahead in our investigation until
we're satisfied that every single person who was responsible for
his death is brought to justice either in the United States or in
Mexico,'' Burke said.
   Another person charged in connection with the Camarena case,
Ruben Zuno Arce, 59, the brother-in-law of former Mexican President
Luis Echeverria, was arrested Saturday by DEA agents at Los Angeles
International Airport as he got off a plane arriving from Mexico.
   Zuno Arce pleaded ``absolutely innocent'' Monday to charges that
he plotted to torture and kill Camarena. Co-defendant Juan Jose
Bernabe Ramirez is charged with the felony murder of a federal
agent, among other things. Three other people were convicted in
1988 in Los Angeles on charges connected to the Camarena killing.

   Police and soldiers battled
Wednesday with more than 8,000 blacks protesting the prosecution of
neighbors for not paying electric bills. Police said about 400
people were arrested and 12 injured, including six officers.
   The clash, one of the largest in South Africa this year,
occurred when blacks began a march toward the courthouse in Ermelo,
120 miles east of Johannesburg, despite having been denied
permission for the protest.
   Police headquarters said marchers began throwing stones after
officers tried to disperse them with tear gas and stun grenades.
Officers then fired birdshot, injuring at least six people,
including a child, police said.
   The five wounded adults were held in custody to face charges of
public violence, while 397 people arrested at the courthouse were
released with a warning, police said.
   While the clash was in progress, government offices in Ermelo's
black township were firebombed, police said.
   The marchers were protesting the start of court proceedings
against 88 residents of the township for not paying electric bills.
   Earlier Wednesday, police reported three more deaths in
factional fighting between rival black groups near Durban, bringing
the death toll around the port city this month to 71. Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok said 380 police reinforcements were bening
sent into the area's embattled shantytowns.
   Several dozen other blacks have been killed elsewhere in Natal
Province this month in an escalation of a political power struggle
that has claimed about 2,500 lives in three years.
   Police also reported more violence related to a six-week strike
by more than 20,000 black employees of the state transport company,
which runs rail and harbor operations nationwide. Five coaches were
set afire and a constable was thrown to his death from a moving
train near Kathlehong, east of Johannesburg.
   South African Transport Services said it fired 2,477 more
strikers, raising to 15,094 the number dismissed during the strike.
The strikers are demanding an increase of their minimum monthly
wage from $225 to $560.
   The main combatants in the Natal violence are the United
Democratic Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition, and
Inkatha, 1.5 million-member political group headed by Zulu leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, but they have been battling each
other for supremacy in Natal since late 1986.
   The United Democratic Front, which is aligned with the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement, favors protests,
strikes and sanctions to pressure the white-run government.
   The relatively conservative Buthelezi does not support such
measures and has been criticized by the front for participating in
the black homeland system. Both groups concede they do not have
full control of all their supporters.
   Hundreds of residents in the townships have fled their homes,
and some are living with white friends or employers in Durban.

<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 14-year-old boy has received a life
term without parole for twice raping an elderly woman when he was
13.
   Joe Harris Sullivan, who was sentenced Tuesday, would have been
eligible for parole after 25 years if he had killed his victim and
received life for first-degree murder, Assistant State Attorney
Larry Kaden said Wednesday.
   Florida law doesn't provide for paroling criminals given life
terms in certain non-capital cases, Kaden said. Sullivan's past
criminal record and other crimes committed in connection with the
rapes gave him a sentencing guideline score that called for life,
Kaden said.
   ``I'm going to try to send him away for as long as I can,''
Circuit Judge Nicholas Geeker said before imposing two concurrent
life sentences on the Pensacola youngster.
   Regardless of the boy's age, he deserved the maximum sentence
because of his long criminal history, including an assault on a
mental health clinic counselor and a burglary during which he
killed a dog, Kaden told the judge. Geeker agreed.
   ``He is beyond help,'' the judge said. ``The juvenile system has
been utterly incapable of doing anything with Mr. Sullivan.''
   Kaden said he expected the case to be appealed. Sullivan's
attorney, Mack Plant, said Wednesday that he doesn't handle
appellate work but that the court would appoint an attorney for the
youth if he wanted to appeal.
   A jury convicted Sullivan as an adult of burglary, theft and
sexual battery after about 30 minutes of deliberation Nov. 30.
   He was accused of breaking into the 74-year-old woman's home
while she was away May 4 and stealing jewelry and cash and then
returning the same day to rape her twice at knifepoint.
   ``I have fears. I have nightmares,'' the woman told Geeker
before he sentenced Sullivan. ``It has had a bad psychological
effect on me.''
   She said he probably would have killed her if neighbors had not
called for help.
   Sullivan said nothing at the hearing and showed no emotion as
the sentence was pronounced.
   ``He didn't have any reaction at all,'' Plant said in a
telephone interview. ``He was just kind of emotionless.''
   Plant said the youth had insisted all along he was innocent.
   ``That's quite a sentence,'' Plant said. ``He had quite a
criminal history, but I think he would be a candidate for
rehabilitation.''
   Plant agreed that the boy's sentence was tougher than what he
probably would have received for a murder conviction.
   A first-degree murder conviction can be punished by death and
the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld such sentences for murderers as
young as 16, but has not ruled on cases involving younger children.

   Moslem separatists freed the daughter of
a Cabinet minister Wednesday after the government released five of
their jailed comrades, officials said.
   Rubaiya Sayeed, daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed,
was taken to a friend's home in this northern city two hours after
the militants were freed downtown, police said.
   Ms. Sayeed, 22, was flown to New Delhi later and met at the
airport by her father, mother, brother and sister. She hugged her
father, then buried her face on his shoulder and cried.
   Young Moslem men celebrated the militants' release by shooting
off firecrackers in Srinagar, summer capital of India's
northernmost state of Jammu-Kashmir, which borders Pakistan.
   About 3,000 people shouted anti-India slogans and waved the
national flag of Pakistan, which has fought three wars with India
over Kashmir since both nations gained independence from Britain in
1947.
   Ms. Sayeed was abducted at gunpoint Dec. 8 as she was going home
from her job at a Srinagar hospital.
   The Kashmir Liberation Front, which demands secession from India
of the mainly Moslem state from India, claimed responsibility for
the abduction. Its chairman said the group might try other
kidnappings in its campaign against the Hindu-dominated government.
   The kidnappers had threatened to kill Ms. Sayeed if their
colleagues were not freed.
   Sayeed is the first Moslem to head the Home Ministry, which is
in charge of internal security. The appointment was seen as part of
Prime Minister V.P. Singh's efforts to appease Moslems, who bore
the brunt of Hindu-Moslem riots that claimed more than 300 lives
this fall.
   The kidnapping was the first crisis for Singh, a Hindu who took
office Dec. 2.
   Earlier Wednesday, Sayeed, unshaven and wrapped in a brown
shawl, said solving the militant campaign in Jammu-Kashmir was the
government's ``No. 1 priority program.''
   ``There is a complete collapse of law and order in the state,''
he said.
   The freed militants include Abdul Hamid Sheikh, a top leader of
the Kashmir Liberation Front. Sheikh, who was wounded in a clash
with police last month and arrested, was taken by ambulance from a
Srinagar hospital and handed over to his organization, the
officials said.
   The other four were identified as Noor Homammad Kalwal, Mohammad
Altaf Bhat, Sher Khan Azad and Javed Ahmed Zargar. All had been
arrested on suspicion of subversive activities during the past year
but no charges have been filed.
   The Kashmir Liberation Front, formed in 1965, wants
Jammu-Kashmir, India's only Moslem-majority state, to become
independent or part of predominantly Moslem Pakistan.
   The chairman of the group, Amanullah Khan, said in Pakistan that
he hoped the Indian government would ``adopt a similar wise
attitude toward the future of Kashmir ... instead of waiting until
it is shunted out and humiliated by Kashmiri freedom fighters.''
   Pakistan had denounced the kidnapping as contrary to Islamic
precepts, presumably referring to Islamic tradition, which imposes
rigid guidelines on the treatment of women.
   Khan dismissed the criticism, saying Indian paramilitary troops
``have killed 300 of our people in the last one and a half years,
including women.''
   Asked if his militant organization would try other kidnappings
as part of its secession campaign, Khan replied: ``It depends on
how the Indian government behaves.''
   Moslems make up 64 percent of the state's 5 million peoeple but
only about 12 percent of the country's 880 million people. Hindus
account for about 80 percent.
   Kashmir is claimed by both India and Pakistan and the two
countries have fought three wars over the territory since gaining
independence from Britain in 1947. A cease-fire line monitored by
the United Nations separates the state into Indian and Pakistani
territory.

<TEXT>
   A Texas appeals court today overturned the
murder conviction of a black high school janitor who contended his
prosecution in the 1980 rape and slaying of a white teen-ager was
racially motivated.
   The prosecution of 38-year-old Clarence Brandley was marked by
``blatant unfairness,'' the court said in granting the nine-year
Death Row inmate a new trial. But the court did not directly
address the question of racism.
   Brandley was convicted of murdering 16-year-old Cheryl Fergeson
at a high school. His first trial ended with a hung jury. An
all-white jury found him guilty in a second trial.
   ``I'm trying to hold back the tears,'' Brandley, a former high
school janitor, said from prison in Huntsville today. ``It's made
my Christmas. It's been a long time. It's something I didn't think
was coming.''
   Defense attorney Mike DeGeurin said he would ask for Brandley's
release on bail while prosecutors decide whether to seek a new
trial. If the court agrees and Brandley makes bail, ``he'll be out
before Christmas,'' DeGeurin said.
   Montgomery County District Peter Speers did not immediately
return calls for comment on the ruling and on whether he would
pursue a third trial.
   The appeals court, in a 6-3 opinion, said the state's
investigative procedures lacked ``the rudiments of fairness.''
   Among examples cited by the court were that another janitor who
testified for the state allegedly was threatened by a Texas Ranger,
and that the state suppressed information that could have
implicated someone else.
   ``The principles of due process embodied within the United
States Constitution, must not, indeed cannot, countenance such
blatant unfairness,'' wrote Judge David A. Berchelmann Jr.
   In 1987, after a 10-day hearing, retired District Judge Perry
Pickett recommended that Brandley get a new trial, ruling that the
previous two had been tainted with racism.
   Brandley's attorneys have offered evidence that police and
prosecutors had set out to prove that Brandley, the only black
janitor at the school, was guilty rather than seeking the real
killer.
   During the 1987 hearing, Pickett was told that the district
attorney and trial judge met secretly on strategy against Brandley.
   Prosecutors have denied Brandley was the subject of racial

   ``Thank you, Jesus!'' Brandley's mother, Minnie Ola Brandley,
said when she heard the court's decision. Mrs. Brandley, who lives

   ``I think they have evidence to turn him lose,'' she said. ``My

<HEAD>Police Find Terrorist Red Army Faction Hideout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARLSRUHE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have found a rural hideout
used by two suspected Red Army Faction terrorists who were arrested
last week, the federal prosecutor's office reported Wednesday.
   The hideout was located in an old farm cottage near the town of
Lasbek in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, the office said.
   It said the cottage had been used by Ute Hladki and Frank
Deilke, who were arrested following the terrorist attack two weeks
ago that killed West Germany's leading banker, Alfred Herrhausen.
   Authorities have declined to say if the arrests were connected
to the attack on Herrhausen, chairman of Deutsche Bank. He was
killed when a bomb blew up his car near his home in Bad Homburg.
   North German Radio in Bremen said police received a tip the
cottage had been used by the suspects, and that another couple
staying there had fled.
   The radio report also said that ammunition and weapons were
discovered during a search of the farm buildings.
   Authorities have warned of more possible attacks and stepped up
searches for terrorists since Herrhausen was killed Nov. 30.
   The Red Army Faction, which has carried out attacks against
government, military and business targets in West Germany for more
than 15 years, has claimed responsibility for killing Herrhausen.

   Astronomers have spotted the most distant known
star in the Milky Way, and say the accidental discovery could help
determine the total mass of the galaxy.
   That includes mysterious invisible matter that astronomers know
exists but are unable to identify, an astronomer with the Space
Telescope Science Institute said Tuesday.
   ``Astronomers suspect that there is a lot of additional material
surrounding our galaxy that doesn't give off light,'' said Howard
Bond, who along with two others discovered the distant star last
spring.
   ``We don't know the mass of the Milky Way, but if we can find
objects that are far out and measure their speed, it will help us
determine the galaxy's total mass _ the visible areas and the dark
areas.''
   Astronomers use the speed of stars to determine gravitational
pull upon them, and from its gravity, the mass of the galaxy.
   Astronomers theorize the galaxy's dark matter could be dim stars
that are too faint to be seen, black hole remnants of massive stars
that exploded early in the galaxy's history or some unknown type of
subatomic particle, Bond said.
   ``We used to think that the majority of the mass of the Milky
Way was stars, but now we suspect stars may only be 10 percent of
all the mass,'' he said. Once the mystery of the dark matter is
solved, he said, ``we may find something completely unexpected that
could revolutionize our thinking about physics.''
   Andrew Fraknoi, executive director of the Astronomical Society
of the Pacific in San Francisco, said the discovery is important
because it is another confirmation that the Milky Way is much
larger than once thought.
   ``When you look at in a larger context that's what makes this so
exciting _ if they've really found something so distant that it is
way beyond where we thought the borders of the galaxy lay,'' he
said.
   The scientists stumbled upon the star while studying a distant
galaxy. The star is located 160,000 light years from Earth in the
direction of the constellation Virgo.
   The Milky Way was once thought to be only about 100,000 lights
year across. Since the Earth is about 30,000 light years from the
center of the Milky Way, the discovery means the galaxy is larger
than even more recent estimates indicated.
   ``It was just dumb luck that this star was in the way of what
they were looking at. It was totally serendipitous,'' said Ray
Villard, a spokesman for the institute. ``It just shows that there
are a lot of wonderful surprises out there that we may stumble upon
when we're looking for something else.''
   The star is an isolated member of an immense but thinly
populated halo of old, faint stars surrounding the Milky Way. It
was spotted while astronomers Robin Ciardullo and George Jacoby of
the National Optical Astronomy Observatories in Tucson, Ariz., were
surveying the giant elliptical galaxy M49, which is 50 million
light-years from Earth.
   Ciardullo, Jacoby and Bond have observed the star using
telescopes in Hawaii and Arizona, and measurements of its
brightness have been made at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican
Observatory in Chile.
   The star is a member of a well-known class of stars called the
RR Lyrae variables, Bond said. Because the brightness of those
stars already has been documented, astronomers can use the
brightness of the new star, known only as the ``Virgo variable,''
to measure its distance, he said.

   Mary Rogers Brooks, the only
daughter of humorist Will Rogers, died Wednesday following a brief
illness. She was 76.
   Mrs. Brooks died at St. John's Hospital and Health Center from
complications associated with cancer, said hospital spokeswoman
Paulette Weir.
   Mrs. Brooks performed on stage and in movies in the 1930s under
the stage name ``Mary Howard.'' On Broadway, she performed in ``On
To Fortune'' and ``Crime Marches On.'' Her last movie was ``My
Weakness.''
   ``I decided I really didn't want to be an actress,'' she said
afterward. She spent much of her life living in Italy, Spain and
Morocco and Athens, Greece. She had returned to her home in
Westwood, Calif., in November, said Greg Malak, curator at the Will
Rogers Memorial in Claremore, Okla.
   She is survived by brothers Will Rogers Jr. of Tubac, Ariz., and
James B. Rogers of Bakersfield, Calif.
   Mrs. Brooks will be interred with her parents and brother Fred
in the family sarcophagus at the Will Rogers Memorial, said Malak.

<TEXT>
   Black leader Nelson Mandela,
expected to be released within weeks after 27 years in jail,
visited President F.W. de Klerk on Wednesday to discuss prospects
for negotiating an end to South Africa's racial conflict.
   The main far-right party denounced the meeting, the first
between Mandela and de Klerk, as a step toward white capitulation.
   Liberal leaders, however, hailed the event as evidence the
government accepts the central role of Mandela's outlawed guerrilla
movement, the African National Congress, in any political
settlement.
   The meeting took place against the backdrop of one of the worst
clashes in South Africa this year, as police and soldiers battled
with more than 8,000 blacks protesting the prosecution of neighbors
for not paying electric bills. Police said about 400 people were
arrested and 12 injured, including six officers, in the incident
near Ermelo, 120 miles east of Johannesburg.
   The Justice Ministry said Mandela requested the meeting at
Tuynhuis, the presidential office in Cape Town, and that de Klerk
``welcomed the opportunity.''
   Mandela, the country's best-known black leader, has been
imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for plotting
an anti-government sabotage campaign.
   The meeting was Mandela's second with a South African president
this year. He met with P.W. Botha on July 5, also at Tuynhuis.
   Since replacing Botha on Aug. 15, de Klerk has made several
conciliatory moves toward the black majority in an effort to ease
racial tensions.
   He has loosened restrictions on anti-government protests, met
with prominent opposition leaders, ordered desgregation of
whites-only beaches, traveled to several black-ruled African
states, and proposed the repeal of the Separate Amenities Act,
which permits the segregation of many public facilities.
   On Oct. 15, de Klerk ordered the unconditional release of seven
of Mandela's ANC colleagues. The lack of violence related to their
release is seen as a factor that makes Mandela's freedom likely.
   The two discussed ``ways and means to address current obstacles
in the way of meaningful dialogue,'' the ministry said. ``Follow-up
talks in the new year are envisaged.''
   The talks ``fitted in with Mr. de Klerk's program to consult
with the full spectrum of political opinion concerning the mutual
future of all South Africans,'' the statement said.
   The far-right Conservative Party, which won 31 percent of the
white vote in September's parliamentary elections, said the meeting
represented a de facto legalization of the ANC.
   The Conservative leader, Andries Treurnicht, condemned de Klerk
for meeting the leader of ``a banned terrorist organization'' and
said the president underestimated whites' desire to retain full
political sovereignty.
   The anti-apartheid Democratic Party welcomed the meeting and
said de Klerk should take the further step of agreeing to talks
with the ANC's exiled leadership.
   There was no immediate reaction from the ANC to Wednesday's
meeting. Tom Sebina, a spokesman at headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia,
said he might have a statement Thursday after consulting with his
superiors.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said,
``We applaud the meeting'' between Mandela and de Klerk.
   ``We view the commencement of a dialogue between the government
and credible representatives of the black majority as the most
important first step in the process of change,'' he said.
   David Walsh, a political scientist at the University of Cape
Town, said the meeting was ``symbolic of the very important change
that's taken place in government thinking.''
   ``There is now a recognition by the government of Mr. Mandela's
importance ... and the importance of the ANC,'' Walsh said.
``Slowly but surely a climate is being built up where there can be
formal negotiations about a new constitutional order.''
   De Klerk says he wants to end racial discrimination and extend
political rights to South Africa's 28 million blacks within five
years.
   However, he opposes black majority rule and a one-person,
one-vote system. He envisions some mechanism that will give whites
veto power on major policy decisions.
   Mandela, 71, is not likely to be released this year, but
government sources have said he probably will be freed before
Parliament convenes in early February.
   All prominent black leaders, even conservative ones, say
Mandela's release is a precondition for negotiations with the
government.
   The ANC, headquartered in Zambia, says it will not enter talks
until the 3{-year-old state of emergency is lifted, all political
prisoners are freed, and remaining segregation laws repealed.
Although its bombing and sabotage campaign has been virtually
dormant in recent months, the movement has refused to repudiate
violence.
   De Klerk says he is ready to talk without preconditions to any
political leaders and groups committed to peaceful solutions, but
he has rejected the ANC's demand that non-racial elections be held
for an assembly to draft a post-apartheid constitution. He insists
the ANC is only one of several black political groups that should
participate in negotiations.
   Mandela is held in a suburban-style staff residence at Victor
Verster prison farm near Cape Town and has met regularly with
anti-apartheid leaders and with Cabinet ministers.

<HEAD>60 Percent of Workers Surveyed Back Some Form of Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixty percent of American workers favor
on-the-job drug testing, according to a Gallup poll released
Wednesday by a corporate group that said the results give ``a green
light'' to increased employer testing.
   The survey, done for a newly formed organization of 14 large
corporations concerned about employers' rights, said workers tended
to support some programs over others.
   For example, 51 percent of the 1,007 employees polled indicated
that companies should have the right to randomly test any employee
for drug use. Support rose to 70 percent for testing employees
``suspected of drug usage.''
   Twenty-four percent of the workers said they had seen or heard
of drug use by co-workers on the job.
   On the broadest question, 60 percent of the sample said they
favored their company adopting some sort of drug-testing policy.
Not counted were 9 percent whose employers already have such a
program. Support for testing was strongest from workers in rural
areas, those 55 and older, and those with an education of high
school or less.
   Fourteen percent of those who did not attend college opposed
drug testing at their company, compared to 28 percent for those
with a college degree and 48 percent for those who had done
post-graduate work.
   ``Workers' attitudes are far more conservative than we had
anticipated,'' Mark A. de Bernardo, executive director of the new
Institute for a Drug-Free Workplace, said in a statement.
   ``Employees simply do not want to tolerate working with drug
abusers on the job,'' de Bernardo said. ``More significantly, the
survey reaffirms the policy of increasing numbers of employers who
are drug testing, and gives a clear and unmistakable green light to
further testing of employees and job applicants.''
   The National Labor Relations Board said in June that employers
cannot unilaterally begin testing unionized workers for drug use,
but can test job applicants regardless of whether unions object.
The board said employee testing falls under collective bargaining
and therefore must be the subject of union-management negotiations.
   There was no immediate comment from the AFL-CIO to the survey,
which did show employee reservations about drug testing.
   In one question, only 26 percent of respondents agreed that
testing was ``a necessity.'' Forty-two percent said it should be
done despite reservations, while 29 percent said it invaded privacy
and should be done only under limited circumstances.
   The workers gave their highest support for drug testing of
workers in safety-sensitive jobs.
   The 14 corporatons in the institute each have some sort of
drug-testing program, de Bernardo said.
   They are BellSouth Corp of Atlanta; Capital Cities-ABC Inc.,
Philadelphia; Dow Chemical USA, Midland, Mich.; Georgia-Pacific
Corp., Atlanta; Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, Ohio; Hoffman-La
Roche Inc., Nutley, N.J.; IBM Corp., White Plains, N.Y.; Johnson &amp;
Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J.; Mobil Oil, New York; Motorola Inc.,
Schaumberg, Ill.; Pfizer Inc., New York; Texaco Inc., White Plains,
N.Y.; Texas Instruments, Dallas, and 3M Co., St. Paul, Minn.
   The institute hired the Gallup Organization, which interviewed a
random sample of 1,007 full-time workers around the nation last
month. Forty-two percent of those surveyed described their
occupation as professional, 25 percent as blue collar, 20 percent
as managerial and 10 percent as secretarial or clerical. The rest
were ``other'' or refused to answer the question.
   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.

   President Bush signed legislation today
clearing the way to expand Everglades National Park and ordering
the Army Corps of Engineers to restore the natural flow of water to
the Florida ``river of grass.''
   He also signed a measure providing federal matching funds to
help preserve critical wetlands in the United States, Canada and
Mexico. He said the bills will help achieve his campaign goal of
``no net loss of wetlands.''
   Bush signed the North American Wetlands Conservation Act in a
ceremony in the Roosevelt Room after signing the Everglades measure.
   The wetlands act will provide more than $70 million over four
years to help purchase and preserve wetlands, which serve as vital
feeding areas for ducks and other migratory fowl.
   Bush said the dwindling population of ducks ``is largely
attributable to the steady loss of wetland areas that we've
experienced.'' The United States has been losing wetlands at the
rate of nearly 400,000 acres a year.
   Bush does not favor a ban on development projects that destroy
wetlands, but wants any development offset with an equal amount of
acreage restored as wetlands.
   ``Even in times of serious fiscal constraints, we can still meet
our highest environmental priorities and this is one of mine,''
Bush said in signing the Everglades legislation.
   The 107,600-acre expansion will be undertaken in cooperation
with the state of Florida, which will donate 35,000 new acres to
the federal park. The government estimates it will cost $40 million
to acquire the rest of the new acreage, with Florida havin agreed
to pay 20 percent of the costs.
   The Everglades, the second largest national park in the 48
contiguous states, are home to 13 endangered species, but problems
with the flow of waters have harmed the habitat for both birds and
alligators.
   ``The woodstork, heron, ibis, egret and roseate spoonbill have
all declined dramatically over the years,'' Bush said. ``The
Florida panther, the alligator and many species of fish are
declining.''
   ``The Northeast Shark River Slough, the river of grass through
southern Florida, has been both too shallow and too deep,'' the
president said. ``Through this legislation that river of grass may
now be restored to its natural flow of water.''
   Congress first enacted legislation in 1944 to create Everglades
National Park, and it was dedicated by President Harry Truman in
1947.
   Efforts to drain and reclaim wetlands from the 1880s through the
1930s drastically reduced the natural flow of water through the
Everglades. The Army Corp of Engineers Central and Southern Florida
Project in 1948 helped reduce the damaging flow of salt water and
provided flood control, but left some areas with too much water and
others with too little.
   The new legislation will require the corps to modify the Central
and Southern Florida Project at an estimated cost of $45 million.
   It also puts limits on the use of waterboats in the Everglades,
with current users allowed to keep using the craft on existing
routes.

   NASA said Wednesday it had delayed
the pre-Christmas launch of space shuttle Columbia at least two
days because of lagging work at the launch pad.
   A statement said the new date of Dec. 20 is ``success
oriented,'' meaning that any minor new problem could slip the
liftoff to the 21st.
   It said additional time is needed to validate systems on
recently renovated launch pad 39A and to prepare Columbia.
   ``We feel confident about readiness for a pre-Christmas
liftoff,'' said William Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator for
space flight.
   NASA spokesman Karl Kristofferson said a lot of small problems,
many associated with new pad facilities, had put launch crews
behind schedule.
   If liftoff slipped to Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, it
probably would be postponed a few more days to free workers for the
holiday.
   With the change, the shuttle swapped launch dates with a Titan 3
commercial rocket that had been scheduled for liftoff on Dec. 20.
The Titan, which is to boost British and Japanese communications
satellites, was rescheduled for 7:20 p.m. EST Monday.
   During a 10-day mission, Columbia's five astronauts are to put a
Navy communications satellite into orbit and recover a science
satellite before it falls to Earth. The satellite has been in orbit
nearly six years and is expected to re-enter the atmosphere in
February.
   The flight duration will equal the longest shuttle mission to
date and will be a stepping stone for even longer flights as
Columbia is being modified to stay aloft for 16 days and later for
28 days.
   Loading of propellants for Columbia's in-flight propulsion
systems and auxiliary power units began a day late Monday because a
faulty connector on an electronics box had to be replaced.
   Once the fueling began, the launch pad had to be cleared of all
non-essential personnel because it is dangerous. That prevented
workers from making up lost time in other areas.
   Work was running late even before the connector problem because
of difficulties working with new systems on a mobile launch
platform being used for the first time and with the launch pad,
which recently underwent a two-year, $50 million refurbishment,
receiving 130 modifications.
   In announcing a Dec. 18 launch date, NASA cautioned last week
that the flight might have to be delayed a day or so because of the
new systems.
   Astronaut Dan Brandenstein will command Columbia's crew. The
other crew members are pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialists
Bonnie Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and David Low.

   Even militant anti-apartheid
leaders acknowledge that President F.W. de Klerk, during four
months in power, has moved faster toward political reform than any
of his predecessors.
   But leading activists remain deeply suspicious of him,
suggesting he wants to ease international pressure on South Africa
without forfeiting the white minority's ultimate hold on power.
   De Klerk, 53, is viewed as an affable pragmatist, earnest but
not charismatic.
   He has pledged to phase out discrimination, and has not shied
away from confrontations with right-wing whites who want to
maintain strict apartheid. However, he maintains his long-standing
belief that South African politics must be conducted along racial
lines.
   De Klerk was a lawyer before entering Parliament in 1973. From
1978, he held a series of Cabinet posts, and in 1982 took on the
powerful job of National Party leader in the Transvaal, South
Africa's most populous and wealthiest province.
   P.W. Botha, who had headed the government since 1978, suffered a
stroke in January and de Klerk was elected to replace him as
overall leader of the party. Botha remained in the presidency until
August, when he quit after the Cabinet failed to support his
objections to a planned diplomatic trip by de Klerk to Zambia.
   De Klerk comes from a long line of National Party politicians,
going back to his great-grandfather, who was a senator.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Shrinks to Smallest Figure in Nearly 6 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States recorded its best trade
performance in almost six years from July through September as the
deficit in the broadest measure of trade shrank 29 percent to
$22.69 billion, the government reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said the current account deficit
narrowed by $9.40 billion from a second quarter imbalance of $32.08
billion, reflecting a big jump in the overseas earnings of U.S.
companies.
   But economists discounted the huge swing, saying it did nothing
to change their view that America's trade deficit will remain stuck
at a high level through most of the next decade.
   However, analysts were more upbeat about a second report
Wednesday showing that retail sales, spurred by strong spending on
clothing and furniture, jumped 0.8 percent in November, the biggest
gain in four months.
   Some economists said the surprisingly strong sales report, at
the start of the all-important Christmas sales season, should help
alleviate fears that the economy could be on the verge of tumbling
into a recession.
   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only
trade in merchandise but also trade in services, the category that
includes investment earnings between countries.
   For the third quarter, the services category registered a
surplus of $8.72 billion after posting a $1.66 billion deficit from
April through June, the first services deficit in three decades.
   But the services swing from deficit to surplus was attributed
almost totally to changes in the value of the dollar. In the third
quarter, the dollar was declining, meaning that the profits U.S.
companies earn in foreign currencies were worth more when they were
translated into dollars.
   In the second quarter, a rising dollar had eaten into the
profits Americans companies were earning in foreign currencies.
   The big swing in services helped offset a small increase in the
merchandise trade deficit, which climbed 0.7 percent to $27.75
billion in the third quarter, and a rise in foreign aid and pension
payments, the other category of the current account, which climbed
to $3.66 billion, an increase of 27 percent.
   Analysts forecast that the merchandise trade deficit will remain
at stubbornly high levels in coming years and predicted that the
services account will dip permanently into deficit sometime early
in the 1990s, reflecting the fact that the United States is now the
world's largest debtor nation.
   As residents of a debtor nation, Americans hold less in overseas
assets than foreigners hold in U.S. assets. America's net debtor
position stood at $532.5 billion at the end of last year and is
expected to worsen by an additional $100 billion this year.
   That means that more and more U.S. wealth must be transferred
into foreign hands in the form of interest payments and profits
earned by foreign companies doing business in the United States.
   ``The net debtor number is clearly moving in the wrong
direction,'' said David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill.
``We are still borrowing money from overseas and that means that
our interest payments to foreigners will be going up.''
   At the start of this decade, the United States was running
surpluses in its current account because earnings from American
investments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits in
merchandise trade.
   But as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign
hands to pay for merchandise imports, the investment cushion shrank
rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985, when the United States
became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   Wyss said the third quarter current account deficit, the
smallest since a $20.9 billion imbalance in the first quarter of
1984, could be the last good news in this trade measure for some
time.
   Through the first nine months of this year, the current account
deficit was running at an annual rate of $113.55 billion, down only
modestly from the $126.55 billion deficit recorded in 1988.
   The government is scheduled to report Friday the monthly
merchandise trade figure for October, the first look at how trade
is doing in the fourth quarter.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch, predicted that
the October deficit figure could surge to $9.8 billion, up from a
September deficit of $7.9 billion. He predicted the monthly
merchandise trade deficit would likely remain stuck at the $9
billion level for many months.

   Unheard and unseen by the
public since 1962, Nelson Mandela is nevertheless the most
respected leader among South African blacks, who consider him the
embodiment of their quest for political freedom.
   Mandela, 71, has rejected repeated government offers to free him
if he would renounce violence. He said the government should
renounce violence, end apartheid and unban the African National
Congress.
   Mandela was regarded by many blacks as the paramount leader of
the ANC, although the highest office he held before it was banned
in 1960 was deputy president-general. He was the first commander of
its military wing, ``Spear of the Nation,'' which he helped form in
1961 to engage in a sabotage campaign.
   He subsequently toured Africa, receiving military training and
explaining the ANC's cause. He was arrested after his return, in
1962, and sentenced to five years' hard labor for leaving the
country illegally and inciting blacks to violate the law by
striking.
   In 1963, while Mandela was imprisoned near Cape Town, police
uncovered the ANC's underground headquarters on a farm near
Johannesburg and seized documents outlining plans for the guerrilla
campaign. In June 1964, he and seven co-defendants were sentenced
to life in prison.
   Mandela contracted tuberculosis at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town
and was hospitalized in August 1988. After recovering, he was moved
to Victor Verster prison farm in the wine-growing town of Paarl,
where he has been allowed to meet with a steady flow of relatives
and political colleagues.

<HEAD>FDA Warns Against Using Acidophilus Capsules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FDA is urging consumers not to use an
over-the-counter food supplement distributed by a Pennsylvania
company because some bottles contain capsules with potentially
fatal levels of stannous fluoride.
   Vitamin Specialities Co. of Wyncote, Pa., has asked its 22
retail stores in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania to recall
acidophilus capsules with lot number 069296 and has notified 140
mail-order customers, the Food and Drug Administration said.
   The product is manufactured by Vita-Pure, the FDA said in a
release.
   According to the product label, the acidophilus capsules supply
``friendly bacteria to the intestinal tract'' and help restore and
maintain the mucous membrane that lines the stomach and intestines.
   The company began the recall in late October after two consumers
complained of vomiting and flu-like symptoms after using the
product, the FDA said. However, FDA said it was concerned that many
consumers may still be unaware of the problem because only a small
number of bottles were returned.
   An FDA analysis found that smaller capsules were mixed with
slightly larger acidophilus capsules. The smaller capsules were
found to have an average 784 milligrams of stannous fluoride.
   Stannous fluoride, used in toothpaste, is safe in small amounts.
However, a 784-milligram dose could cause convulsions in an adult
and could be lethal for a small child, the agency said. Five
capsules could kill an adult.
   High doses of stannous fluoride can cause gastrointestinal upset
and vomiting, which could limit the amount ingested and the adverse
effects, the FDA said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
appealed to the world's wealthiest countries Wednesday to make good
on their promises of aid to Poland and Hungary so the new leaders
in Eastern Europe can ``put food on the table and goods on the
shelves of stores.''
   Baker described the plight of Poland as winter approaches as
severe.
   ``Pledges alone aren't enough,'' he told a meeting of two dozen
foreign ministers as they committed their treasuries to a
coordinated assistance program valued at up to $6 billion in the
next several years.
   Most of the aid takes the form of investment and trade credits
not to be paid out immediately. Included in the assistance is a
$200 million U.S. contribution to a $1 billion stablization fund
for Poland.
   Additionally, Baker announced the United States would provide
$200 million to a 10-nation $500 million ``bridge loan'' for Poland
that is to help tide the country past the Christmas season until
the International Monetary Fund declares it qualifies for a
comprehensive aid program.
   Except for the $200 million, which comes out of a U.S. Treasury
fund, Congress last month appropriated $938 million in U.S.
assistance.
   Baker, a former U.S. Treasury secretary, has taken the lead
within the Bush administration in encouraging Eastern European
countries to adopt market economies. As a lure, he dangles U.S. aid.
   Just before coming to Brussels, Baker went to East Germany for
talks with reformist Prime Minister Hans Modrow. He promised the
administration would consider economic support if the country
continued to revise its economy and carried out a pledge to hold
multiparty elections in May.
   Baker told the foreign ministers that ``the multiplying effects
of people power are creating a new East-West equation. Ordinary men
and women are peacefully asserting their basic human rights on a
scale unimagined at the start of the year.''
   But, Baker went on, ``It is our task to support this courageous
reform effort. After the streets emplty of demonstrators, after the
people select new leaders, after governments become the servants of
the people, after all this _ the economies must put food on the
table and goods on the shelves of stores.''

   Five teen-agers have been arrested for
bringing four military hand grenades to junior high school, police
said.
   The boys, ages 14 and 15, were also suspended after authorities
discovered the grenades Monday and Tuesday at Rogers Park Junior
High School.
   The state police bomb squad determined the grenades, about 20
years old, were used by the military to simulate battle conditions.
While the grenades do not break up and spread shrapnel when they
explode, they could kill someone, said Youth Bureau Detective
Russell Benjamin.
   He said the grenades could be less stable and more dangerous
because they are old.
   Police said the grenades were stolen from a Danbury residence,
but police do not know specifically where.
   Principal William Spielberg said a student alerted school
officials to the first grenade, and the school called police.
   Benjamin said the boys would be referred to the Danbury Superior
Court juvenile division. Two were charged with sale of explosives;
the other three were charged with possession. Their names were not
released because of their ages.

<HEAD>Soviet Actress Says She Left Homeland to Pursue Dream in America</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of a Soviet acting troupe who
defected to the United States said Wednesday she loves her homeland
but came to America for more freedom.
   ``I love the people of the Soviet Union and I love the people
here. But I must ... tell you I have one dream. Without this dream,
I can't live,'' said Larisa Firsova, a 24-year-old actress with the
Central Children's Theatre of Moscow.
   Speaking in broken English and at times through an interpreter,
Firsova declined to elaborate on her dream, saying it is considered
bad luck to discuss such matters. She did acknowledge that it
includes becoming an American actress.
   She said she has applied for political asylum and it is ``almost
granted.''
   ``I was told that it's all a matter of paperwork and I should
just wait a few days,'' said Firsova, who is staying with a couple
in the area.
   She declined to be specific but said she sought political asylum
based partly on matters having to do with her husband, Vadim
Firsova, also an actor.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has said it
can't comment on the case because of confidentiality rules.
   Firsova didn't show up Monday as members of the troupe assembled
at their hotel to head for the airport. The group had been
performing as part of an exchange program with the Children's
Theater Company of Minneapolis.
   The actress appeared at the news conference in the office of
U.S. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Min., wearing snow boots, gray slacks
and a Minnesota Vikings sweatshirt.
   Members of Boschwitz's staff presented her with an American flag
that the senator had asked to be flown over the U.S. Capitol as a
token of welcome to her.
   The actress said she would attempt to help her husband emigrate
as soon as possible.
   Firsova said that, while her family did not specifically know
that she would defect on this trip, they knew of her desire to
leave the Soviet Union and supported her.

<HEAD>U.S. Assails Salvadoran Rebels for Rejecting Peace Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department criticized the Salvadoran
rebels Wednesday for rejecting a peace proposal by Central American
presidents, calling the decision a ``tragic, missed opportunity''
to end the bloodshed.
   The five presidents, meeting in Costa Rica earlier this week,
appealed to the FMLN rebels ``to immediately and effectively cease
hostilities ... and rejoin the previously initiated process of
dialogue.''
   A communique issued by the presidents called on the insurgents
to use the dialogue to achieve their demobilization and expressed
explicit support for the Salvadoran government.
   The rebels angrily denounced the communique, ruling out
demobilization. They said the communique gives ``unconditional
support to the principal violator of human rights in the region'' _
the Salvadoran government.
   The insurgents said they cannot be demobilized because they
constitute a ``legitimate force with popular support in the entire
Salvadoran territory.''
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the rebel
statement represents ``a tragic, missed opportunity to end the
bloodshed which has plagued El Salvador.''
   He contrasted the insurgents' stand with that of President
Alfredo Cristiani, who has expressed a willingness to reopen talks
with the FMLN once they end their attacks in civilian areas.
   Discussing the Nicaraguan aspect of the peace process, Boucher
noted that the presidents called for the renewal of cease-fire
talks between the Sandinistas and the Contra rebels. He said those
discussions broke down last month when the Sandinistas unilaterally
walked out.
   ``If the Sandinistas wish to further the goals of the peace
process, including voluntary demobilization, repatriation and
reintegration of resistance members under secure and democratic
conditions, they should renew their direct talks with the
resistance,'' he said.
   He added that the Sandinistas should also take immediate steps
toward further democratization, especially ending the harassment
and violence against opposition candidates and supporters and
freeing political prisoners.
   In a concession to the Sandinistas, the presidents also called
on the United States to transfer to a United Nations-Organization
of American States commission U.S. funds being provided to the
Contras for food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies.
   Boucher said U.S. officials would consult closely with Central
American, United Nations and Contra officials to determine how best
to carry out that aspect of the presidents' communique.
   ``The important thing is that we believe these people (the
Contras) continue to need food, clothing and medicine. That's
exactly what we are providing,'' Boucher said.

<HEAD>Slightly More Raw Foods Free of Excess Pesticides, FDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 96 percent of raw foods sold in the
United States in 1988 had no pesticide residues or had levels
within the legal limit, the Food and Drug Administration said
Wednesday.
   That's a slight increase over 1987, when 95 percent of the foods
sampled did not contain illegally high levels of pesticides.
   The FDA's analysis also showed that 61 percent of the foods
sampled in 1988 had no pesticide residues, compared with 57 percent
the previous year.
   Of the nearly 4 percent of foods sampled in the 1988 analysis
that contained pesticide residues above the levels allowed, most
involved residues for which the Environmental Protection Agency has
set no tolerance level, the FDA said.
   The FDA sampled 18,114 imported and domestic food products for
its latest report, about 25 percent more than in 1987.
   The analysis found more imports contained higher-than-allowed
pesticide residues than domestic foods. Of the 10,475 import
samples analyzed, 6 percent contained excessive residues, while
about 2 percent of the 7,639 samples of domestic foods exceeded the
tolerance level or contained residues of pesticides not permitted
for use on that product, the FDA said.
   The study covered 256 pesticides.
   Vegetables had the highest proportion of excessive pesticide
residues at 5.6 percent. A breakdown shows that 7 percent of
imported vegetables fall into that category compared with less than
3 percent of domestic products.

   Why stop with jolly? At a farm near
Barclay, ``'Tis the season to go hog wild.''
   That's what's written across a wreath on the farm of Jack and
Helen Miller, southwest of Osage City in eastern Kansas. They've
fixed up the quarters of their three sows and 34 piglets, who live
in what was once the old Barclay school building, with appropriate
holiday trappings.
   The old pig house has been decorated for three years now with
red-colored garlands and cardboard Christmas decorations. The pigs'
own miniature Christmas tree, decorated with tinsel and ornaments,
sits in the corridor as a radio plays Christmas music.
   Next year, Mrs. Miller plans to hang a decoration outside _ a
lighted sleigh pulled by eight tiny pigs.
   She got the idea of decorating the pig parlor four years ago
when a litter of pigs was born on Christmas Eve.
   ``It is a happy time of year,'' she said. ``Everybody ought to
enjoy it.''
   Mrs. Miller said she thought it was appropriate to decorate the
parlor because other barnyard animals were in the manger when
Christ was born.
   ``I`ve always thought there were pigs in the manger scene,'' she
said. ``I bet they were there. We just didn`t see them.''

   Five pairs of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara
look-alikes competed in a ``Gone With the Wind'' 50th anniversary
contest, and the winner was _ lawsy me! _ a Yankee.
   Robert Noll of Hudson, Ohio, was picked by a panel of judges
Tuesday night as the most convincing double of Butler, as played by
Clark Gable in the 1939 movie.
   The winning Scarlett was, appropriately, a Southern belle, Emily
Schapmann of Birmingham, Ala.
   They will host an antebellum anniversary ball Thursday night and
appear Friday night at the Fox Theatre during a re-creation of the
movie's Dec. 15, 1939, world premiere.
   Noll rebuffed questions about being a Yankee Rhett Butler.
   ``I'm just glad to be any Rhett Butler,'' he said, noting that
Gable himself was born in Ohio. Butler was from Charleston, S.C.
   And how did Ms. Schapmann feel about winning as Scarlett?
   ``I'll think about that tomorrow,'' she said.

   A man who tried to steal 75 cents from an
88-year-old woman last Christmas Eve, then punched her in the face
because she didn't have more money, has been sentenced to 20 years
in prison.
   Joseph Lynn Harris' sentence for attacking Celina McMurray was
tougher than most because he had a prior conviction from a 1984
burglary, Assistant District Attorney Rebecca King said Tuesday.
   Harris had pleaded guilty to robbing Ms. McMurray.
   During sentencing Tuesday, Ms. McMurray told District Judge Sam
Kiser that Harris and his co-defendant, Ricky Wilson, beat her,
tied her to a chair and ransacked her apartment.
   She said the men said they had been sent by the landlord to fix
her stove. She said she knew their story wasn't true, but let them
in anyway.
   The men threatened to kill her if she didn't give them all her
money, Ms. McMurray testified.
   A neighbor called police, and officers arrived soon enough to
catch the men in the apartment.
   Wilson received probation because he had no criminal record, Ms.
King said.

<TEXT>
   This tiny Ozarks community proudly calls itself
``Missouri's Christmas City,'' but there's little holiday cheer
this season because the murder of the town's popular bank president
remains unsolved.
   More than two months have passed since Dan Short was kidnapped
from his home in predawn darkness and forced to open the State Bank
of Noel vault for his abductors, who took about $70,000.
   His kidnappers taped him to a chair weighted with concrete
blocks and a 30-pound chain, then threw him from a bridge into an
Oklahoma lake, where he drowned.
   The FBI says it has no suspects and few leads. Many people in
the town of 1,200 near the Arkansas and Oklahoma borders believe
the odds of finding Short's killers shrink daily because of the
lack of suspects and evidence.
   ``The consensus of people who come in and out of my post office
is it will go unsolved,'' Postmaster Bill Poage said.
   Nearly every door on festively decorated Main Street bears a
yellow ribbon ``to signify we're waiting for Dan's killers to be
caught,'' said Dan Coleman, who bought his hardware store with a
loan from Short's bank.
   The 51-year-old president of the town's lone bank is remembered
as a ``genuine nice guy'' and community booster.
   After moving to Noel in 1986, Short did commentary on radio
broadcasts of high school sporting events and wrote a weekly sports
column for an area newspaper.
   Only hours before he was abducted, Short agreed to be master of
ceremonies at the community Christmas parade for the third
consecutive year.
   ``He was the kind of guy who, instead of sending someone to get
the mail each morning, would walk to the post office and get it
himself,'' Coleman said.
   FBI special agent Max Geiman said investigators have not found
anyone in Short's 24-year banking career who might want to kill him.
   What investigators do know is this:
   About 3 a.m. on Oct. 6, a vehicle believed to be carrying three
men drove to Short's home about five miles southwest of Noel.
Short, who lived alone, was awakened and forcibly driven to the
bank.
   Someone also drove Short's pickup truck to the bank.
   Two shots from a .45-caliber revolver disabled the bank's
surveillance camera and the lens was spray-painted.
   Short opened the vault and his abductors scooped up cash _
police will say only that it was in the neighborhood of $70,000 _
mostly in $5 and $2 bills and quarters.
   The FBI believes the kidnappers intended all along to kill Short
after he opened the vault. They bound his hands and feet with duct
tape, taped him to an antique chair and tossed him from a bridge
into Grand Lake of the Cherokees, about 10 miles west of Noel. His
body was found five days later.
   Gerald Elkins, a reporter for the McDonald County Press,
portrayed Short in a re-enactment of the crime for the syndicated
television series ``Hard Copy.''
   ``When they tied me up and tipped me over the bridge, I knew
there was no danger of me falling but it was still frightening,''
he said. ``At that point, Dan Short knows he's going to get killed.
You know he was scared to death.''
   Floodlights have gone up around homes since Short's murder, said
Donald Duncan, Short's friend and golf partner. The close-knit
community will probably never feel totally safe again, he said.
   Many fear that Short knew his killers and that they are still in
the area. The FBI has not ruled out that possibility, Geiman said.
   Banks in at least three states have posted a $50,000 reward, and
Geiman said the FBI is optimistic the case will eventually be
solved.
   Meanwhile, residents are trying to get on with their lives,
hoping that the killers will eventually be brought to justice.
   ``It's with you 24 hours a day, but you have to get your mind
back on business,'' Duncan said. ``Life goes on.''

<HEAD>Brazil's Presidential Campaign Gets Muddy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidential race has taken a turn
for the nasty with a campaign spot in which a candidate's
ex-girlfriend charges he offered her money to get an abortion when
she was pregnant with their daughter.
   ``He ruined my life,'' said Miriam Cordeiro, referring to
socialist candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, in an ad broadcast
on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   In addition to talking about their relationship and the couple's
illegitimate 15-year-old daughter, Ms. Cordeiro also said da Silva,
known as Lula, was a racist and ``couldn't stand blacks.'' A
majority of Brazil's 150 million people are black or mixed-race.
   The ad was made by Lula's opponent, Fernando Collor de Mello of
the conservative National Reconstruction Party. Ms. Cordeiro says
in the spot that her testimony was voluntary, but a former campaign
worker for Collor de Mello claims the woman was paid about $23,000
for her participation.
   ``I couldn't remain silent facing a case of corruption,'' said
the worker, Maria Helena Amaral, adding she had quit Collor de
Mello's campaign staff after the interview.
   The Brazilian press has roundly condemned Collor de Mello's
tactics.
   ``The campaign reaches the bottom,'' the respected daily
newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo said Wednesday.
   Lula's campaign coordinator, Vladimir Pomar, called the
interview ``baixaria'' _ ``a low blow.''
   The candidate says his daughter, Lurian, was born after an
affair with Ms. Cordeiro following the death of his first wife in
1969. The press earlier this year ``discovered'' Lurian, but
Brazilians did not react strongly to the disclosure.
   ``He offered me money to get an abortion,'' Ms. Cordeiro said in
the spot. ``When she was born, I put her in his lap and said `Now
go ahead and kill her, because when she was in my belly I wouldn't
let you.'''
   Lula, in his own TV spot Wednesday, was shown standing beside
Lurian, who was wearing the red-star button of Lula's
Marxist-oriented Workers Party.
   ``Lurian was the product of a gesture of love,'' the stocky,
bearded Lula said. ``To me, all that matters is what my daughter
thinks of me. She knows what kind of a father she has.''
   After his affair with Ms. Cordeiro, Lula remarried with Marisa
Leticia, the widow of a slain taxi driver, who has one son. The da
Silvas had three more sons, and Mrs. da Silva takes part in Lula's
campaign rallies.
   The personal accusations were seen as a response to polls
showing Lula rapidly catching up as Sunday's runoff election
approaches. Collor de Mello previously has portrayed his rival as a
communist and a proponent of ``armed struggle.''
   A poll published Wednesday by the respected Brazilian Institute
of Public Opinion and Statistics showed Collor de Mello held a slim
4 percentage point lead over Lula. Just 10 days ago, polls had
Collor de Mello leading by 15 points.
   In the latest survey, the institute interviewed 3,650 people in
their homes between Dec. 8 and Dec. 12. It showed 47 percent of
those questioned preferred Collor de Mello and 43 percent supported
Lula. The margin of error was 2 percent.
   The two candidates were the top vote-getters in a 21-candidate
field in the first-round election Nov. 15. Neither candidate won a
majority, and a runoff was set for Sunday.
   Political analysts said the new ad shows how worried Collor de
Mello's supporters are.
   ``With the desperation of someone who sees a certain victory
endangered, Collor de Mello ... has assumed a right-wing posture,
of order vs. chaos. He has made the campaign an ideological
showdown,'' political columnist Ricardo Noblat wrote Tuesday in the
Jornal do Brasil newspaper of Rio.
   The election is Brazil's first popular balloting for president
in 29 years. The last free vote was in 1960, when Janio Quadros was
elected. He resigned after seven months in office, and three years
later the armed forces took power in a coup and ruled the country
until 1985.
   Civilian President Jose Sarney was chosen by an electoral
college controlled by the outgoing generals.

   Five teen-agers have been arrested for
bringing four military hand grenades to junior high school, police
said.
   The boys, ages 14 and 15, were also suspended after authorities
discovered the grenades Monday and Tuesday at Rogers Park Junior
High School.
   The state police bomb squad determined the grenades, about 20
years old, were used by the military to simulate battle conditions.
While the grenades do not break up and spread shrapnel when they
explode, they could kill someone, said Youth Bureau Detective
Russell Benjamin.
   He said the grenades could be less stable and more dangerous
because they are old.
   Police said the grenades were stolen from a Danbury residence,
but police do not know specifically where.
   Principal William Spielberg said a student alerted school
officials to the first grenade, and the school called police.
   Benjamin said the boys would be referred to the Danbury Superior
Court juvenile division. Two were charged with sale of explosives;
the other three were charged with possession. Their names were not
released because of their ages.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Bruce Beresford's movie
based on Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, has won the
D.W. Griffith Award for best movie of 1989.
   Morgan Freeman, who portrays the elderly chauffeur of an
eccentric Southern Jewish matron in the movie, was named best
actor, and Michelle Pfeiffer received the best actress prize for
her role as the singer who perks things up for Beau and Jeff
Bridges in ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   The annual awards, given out by the National Board of Review,
were announced Wednesday.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' which also stars Jessica Tandy as Daisy
Werthan and Dan Aykroyd as her son, is the story of the 25-year
relationship between Miss Daisy and her chauffeur woven into the
fabric of change in the New South.
   Other winners were:
   _ Supporting Actor: Alan Alda, ``Crimes and Misdemeanors.''
   _ Supporting Actress: Mary Stuart Masterson, ``Immediate
Family.''
   _ Director: Kenneth Branagh, ``Henry V.''
   _ Foreign Film: ``Story of Women.''
   _ Documentary: ``Roger and Me.''

   _ Miniseries: ``Lonesome Dove.''
   The National Board of Review is one of the nation's oldest
motion picture associations, established in 1909. It is an
organization that recognizes film as an art form rather than a
business or simply entertainment.
   The awards ceremony will take place in New York on Feb. 26.

<HEAD>Long-Distance Telephone Surveyor's Call Saves Would-Be Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A random call by a phone surveyer working
the night shift in Iowa rescued an Arizona man from an apparent
suicide attempt.
   Carol Edwards, 39, was making random calls nationwide Monday
night when she triggered an answering machine at a Tempe home.
   The slurred voice of a man said, ``My car's in the garage and so
am I,'' said Juan Perez, a Tempe police spokesman.
   ``I was quite shocked at first,'' said Ms. Edwards. ``At first I
thought maybe it was I joke. I was hoping it was.'' She conferred
with her supervisor, Chuck Sitter, at Frank N. Magid Associates, a
consulting and research firm, in Marion, Iowa.
   ``We called the Tempe Police Department and they said they were
happy we did,'' said Sitter, 27.
   Within minutes of Sitter's call, Officer Alison Miller arrived
at the Tempe home and found it seemingly unoccupied although a
cassette recording repeatedly was playing the country-Western song
``I'll Be Missing You.''
   ``I thought I heard a car and went straight for the garage. It
was dark in there and I turned on a flashlight. I saw a man
kneeling beside the driver's door. His head was slumped but his
hands were hanging onto the window,'' Ms. Miller recalled, adding
that the car's fumes were ``pretty strong, like it had been running
for awhile.''
   The man apparently was attempting suicide by carbon-monoxide
poisoning and also appeared to have overdosed on drugs, said Perez.
   Police believe the 42-year-old man was having ``family problems,
marital problems,'' Perez said.
   The man was given emergency room treatment, then transferred to
a psychiatric hospital, where officials declined to discuss the
matter Wednesday.
   ``What are the chances of this person in Iowa calling a random
number in Tempe and getting a recording'' describing a suicide
attempt? Perez asked.
   ``And what are the chances of listening to the recording and not
hanging up,'' he said of Ms. Edwards. ``A lot of people hate
talking to recorders.''

<HEAD>Female Santa Says Money Giveaway `Was Fun'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cheerful Bostonian who flabbergasted bar
patrons by handing out money _ $100 bills, $50s and $20s _ shrugs
off the uproar she created.
   ``I'm just me. It's like I had this extra money, so I just
started giving it out,'' said Judy Kelly, 53, who describes herself
as the daughter of ``an industrial tycoon'' and a Chicago native.
   ``It was fun.''
   ``People keep asking why,'' Ms. Kelly said, smiling up at
reporters during a news conference Tuesday.
   ``It just happened. ... It's not like I was blowing the rent
money.''
   She said she was thrilled by the ``smiles that came back. ... It
was great; it was great.''
   By some estimates, she gave away $5,000 in the lounge of a motel
near Midway Airport before police asked her to stop. Her generosity
was causing traffic jams as would-be recipients stampeded to the
scene.
   The officers, called by concerned tavern owners, also advised
her to save a little money for a rainy day.
   ``I promised the police I would stop giving money away,'' she
said Tuesday, but ``I can still do things quietly.
   ``I think people should maybe read the dictionary and look up
the word `give.'''
   Until the news conference, Ms. Kelly had eluded the spotlight
since her giveaway late Saturday and early Sunday. And she did not
return telephone calls Wednesday.
   What prompted Tuesday's resurfacing?
   Hotel manager Lola Andreas at the Holiday Inn-Midway, where Ms.
Kelly was staying, asked for a contribution a children's Christmas
party the hotel sponsors for the state Department of Children and
Family Services.
   ``She said she didn't have any money, but that she could help
with publicity,'' Ms. Andreas said.
   As Ms. Kelly predicted, several reporters turned out for her
news conference at the hotel.
   ``We're using you,'' she said, teasing.
   After her performance as Mrs. Claus, Ms. Kelly was arrested
early Sunday on a misdemeanor disorderly-conduct charge after her
Jaguar stalled near the airport and she was reported trying to
direct traffic and creating a ruckus.
   Ms. Kelly was released on her own recognizance, pending
evaluation at the Bobby Wright Comprehensive Community Mental
Health Center, where officials found no reason to hold her, and
Barbara Morgan, shift coordinator at the city's Human Services
department. She said agency workers took Ms. Kelly to a motel
before dawn Sunday.
   She is to appear in court Jan. 26 on the municipal charge, which
carries a penalty of from $5 to $500, city officials said.
   Neighbors were perplexed back home in Boston, where Ms. Kelly
has lived for 10 years in a neighborhood of narrow streets with
Italian shops and restaurants.
   ``This is unbelievable, what's going on,'' said an upstairs
neighbor, Nancy, who asked that her last name not be used.
   ``I was shocked,'' said Robert Lynch, owner of the J&amp;B Variety
Store around the corner. ``She's never done anything like this
since I've known her. She's a normal, average person.''

<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BATTICALOA, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful rebel group negotiating
with the government for political power ousted a rival militia
Wednesday in a battle that killed an estimated 60 people, mostly
militiamen, residents said.
   In a three-pronged attack launched shortly before midnight
Tuesday, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam surrounded the town
of Batticaloa, residents said.
   One young woman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
rebels came down the coast road from the lagoon and the jungle late
Tuesday night. By midmorning Wednesday, she said, the shooting had
stopped.
   By sundown Wednesday, Batticaloa's General Hospital had received
26 bodies.
   ``Only one was a Tiger,'' a hospital official said. ``The rest
were from the other side.''
   Like many other people in this town of 60,000 people, he was
reluctant to speak the name of the ``other side.'' But they
acknowledged they meant the Tamil National Army, a group set up
shortly before the Indian peacekeeping forces withdrew from
Batticaloa late last month.
   ``Most of them, according to parents, were forcibly conscripted
to fight the Tigers,'' one hospital employee said.
   The Sri Lankan government has accused departing Indian troops,
at the behest of pro-Indian Tamil groups, of training and arming
the Tamil army, which the Colombo government has outlawed.
   The Indian government, which sent peacekeeping soldiers to Sri
Lanka two years ago to put down the Tamil rebellion, has denied
allegations it created the Tamil National Army.
   In addition to the 26 bodies at Batticaloa General Hospital,
three more were seen along the road leading into town.
   Young Tiger guerrillas, most in their teens and carrying shining
new AK-47 assault rifles, claimed at least 50 members of the Tamil
National Army were killed in the battle.
   Well-placed residents in Batticaloa estimate the total death
toll at 50 to 60. One said it might be as high as 90.
   ``The bodies have been pouring in all day and still they are
arriving,'' the hospital official said. ``More will come when it is
light again and people can find transport.''
   The last of the bodies to reach the hospital as darkness fell
lay on the floors of vans parked inside the hospital's front gate.
At least three had their hands tied behind their backs. In the
fading light, their wounds were not clearly visible but all
appeared to have been shot in the head or neck.
   ``My husband. I have lost my husband,'' wailed Nathivathany, in
between sobs that shook her entire body.
   Nathivathany's husband, Thayaparan, was one of the young men
whose bodies lay in a heap in the back of the van. Friends said the
young couple had been married only a short time.
   But elsewhere in the town, there was an air of calm, with
teen-age Tigers standing along the streets in twos and fours.
   Red-and-white banners erected by the Tigers proclaimed ``great
heroes days'' in the Tamil language.
   ``The Tigers were very polite when they came into town after the
shooting,'' said an English-speaking woman. ``People gave them tea
and said we had dreams for the liberation of Batticaloa.
   ``Eighteen months ago people of Batticaloa compained about our
Tamil militia _ including the Tigers _ saying they had been forced
to contribute money, provide free food and even their own
television sets,'' said the woman, also speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   But as the Tigers tried to enter the political mainstream, they
also had embarked on a public relations campaign, one that seems to
be working. The Tamil National Army does not enjoy the same support.
   Batticaola is 135 miles east of Colombo and is one of the two
eastern districts where India pulled out 10,000 of its troops in
the past two months. India has said the remaining 26,000 troops
will be out of Sri Lanka by Dec. 31.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American church worker
accused of storing weapons for leftist rebels in El Salvador was
released from prison today into the custody of the U.S. ambassador.
   President Alfredo Cristiani said Jennifer Casolo, 28, of
Thomaston, Conn., was released after 2{ weeks in jail because of
insufficient evidence and would be deported. He said she would be
asked to remain a witness in the case.
   ``If the evidence against her becomes sufficient, she will be
summoned to return for trial,'' Cristiani told a news conference,
although he acknowledged little could be done to force her to
return.
   Shortly afterwards, reporters staking out the Ilopango prison
saw Ms. Casolo leave in a black Cadillac with U.S. Ambassador
William Walker. The Cadillac was escorted by a caravan of Jeeps.
There was no opportunity for Ms. Casolo to comment and no
indication where the caravan was headed.
   Cristiani said he thought Ms. Casolo probably had in fact
cooperated with rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, who launched a major urban offensive in San Salvador last
month.
   Cristiani said she was being released only because legally there
was not enough evidence to hold her.
   ``I am morally convinced that Miss Casolo is guilty,'' Cristiani
said. He said she was being freed only because of lack of evidence.
   The president said he had not been pressured by the government
of the United States to order Ms. Casolo's release. The United
States is a key financial supporter of the rightist government in
its war with the rebels.
   Ms. Casolo was charged with acts of terrorism, possessing
weapons of war and criminal association. She denied the charges.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said earlier today he had been
told in telephone conversations with Salvadoran officials,
including Cristiani, that Ms. Casolo would be released and expelled
from the country by Thursday afternoon.
   Cristiani ``informs me that the judge in her case has ultimately
concluded the charges against Jennifer were not fully supported by
the evidence, and that she could not thus be fairly prosecuted
under Salvadoran law,'' Dodd said in a statement released by his
office.
   Ms. Casolo went to El Salvador in 1985 to work for Christian
Education Seminars, a group that organizes tours for Americans to
learn about the 10-year-old civil war.
   Ms. Casolo and two Salvadoran friends were arrested Nov. 26
after a police raid on her house in San Salvador. From the walled
garden behind the house, police said, they uncovered 103 mortar
grenades, 213 blocks of dynamite, 405 detonators, 150 feet of
slow-burning fuse and 21,945 rounds of ammunition for Soviet-made
automatic rifles.
   Ms. Casolo is to be expelled from El Salvador, according to the
agreement reached with Salvadoran officials, Dodd said.
   On Tuesday, El Salvador's ambassador to the United States,
Miguel Angel Salaverria, said Ms. Casolo would be released if she
provided police with information about the people from whom she
rented her house.

   Sirens wailed across Poland at noon
Wednesday to mark the eighth anniversary of the 1981 martial-law
crackdown, which Lech Walesa declared should be a reminder of the
need for ``pluralism and tolerance.''
   Hundreds of young people took to the streets in five cities,
however, hurling rocks and firebombs to express anger at the
crackdown and demand punishment for those responsible.
   In the most open discussion to date of the decision, newspapers
were filled with articles examining Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski's Dec.
13, 1981, declaration to suppress the Solidarity labor movement.
   ``Before December 1981 Solidarity did not appreciate the
strength of the authorities,'' Jaruzelski told Solidarity's Gazeta
Wyborcza newspaper. ``After December 1981, the authorities did not
appreciate the strength of Solidarity.''
   In the crackdown, carried out with military precision,
communication to the outside world was cut, thousands of Solidarity
activists were rounded up and interned, the union was ordered
suspended and at least nine miners died resisting authorities.
   Eight years after the event, Solidarity has not only regained
legal status but it has taken control of the government from the
Communist Party. However, activists allowed Jaruzelski to be
elected president in July with the minimum number of votes required.
   While older Solidarity activists approached the anniversary
somberly, hundreds of demonstrators in Katowice hurled firebombs
and paint at the doors of the provincial party headquarters, state
radio reported.
   In Szczecin, several hundred teen-agers rallied and marched to
police headquarters where they burned Jaruzelski in effigy, chanted
``Down with Communism,'' and threw stones and bottles at the
building before police turned water cannons on them, radio said.
   A group of demonstrators attacked police headquarters with
stones in Wroclaw and officers responded with truncheons, the state
PAP news agency reported. Smaller anti-communist marches also took
place outside the national Communist Party headquarters in Warsaw
and, according to state television, in Krakow.
   In his message to mark the anniversary, Walesa muted his
criticism while stressing that there should be efforts at
reconciliation.
   Whether Polish national interests required the implementation of
martial law is a question ``that belongs to historians,'' Walesa
said.
   ``However one does not need scientific analysis to see the
senselessness of the human losses and persecutions, the campaign of
slanders and humiliations, the cult of force and the pacifying of
public life.
   ``Today the tragedy of martial law reminds us of the need for
cultured politics, pluralism and tolerance. The dramatic
experiences of those days cannot be repeated, because _ among other
things _ we are wiser from those experiences.
   ``The tragedy of martial law cannot overshadow the future, and
the squaring of accounts cannot replace the striving for a just and
prosperous Poland,'' Walesa said.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said the date
has deep meaning for her, especially sitting in a government where
``literally, those who eight years ago were arrested and those who
gave and signed the orders sit side by side.''
   The fact the two sides could overcome their differences proves
that ``those eight years, which were very hard and brought a lot of
misfortunes, were not wasted. They became a lesson for both sides.
The Communist side became convinced that without the participation
of society it is not possible to govern. The opposition was shown
that relentlessness in striving for freedom has got to be combined
with political realism.''

that relentlessness in striving for freedom has got to be combined
with political realism.''
   Solidarity had called on factories nationwide to sound sirens at
noon in memory of the day still vividly and painfully remembered.
   Among those interviewed by the Communist Party weekly Polityka
were Col. Wieslaw Gornicki, Jaruzelski's close aide, who said at
the time he believed martial law was inevitable, although today he
is unsure whether moderates on both sides could have prevented it.
   Gornicki said the public should remember Soviet pressure on
Poland, and Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev's ``threats, about
which the public still knows too little.''
   At a March 1982 meeting with Jaruzelski, Brezhnev ``sneered''
that martial law was a ``lamentable half measure'' and authorities
should be even tougher, Gornicki said.
   Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, whose police and riot troops
carried out the crackdown, told the newspaper he regrets the
``injustice and harm'' that people feel, but that as a historical
experience martial law ``turned out to be educative and valuable.''
   ``From this experience stems the success of dialogue and today's
essentially changing Poland,'' he said.''
   In a commentary, Gazeta Wyborcza said it is possible to discuss
martial law ``in a calmer way.''
   Justified non-violent resistance to martial law and loyalty to
Solidarity through the difficult years finally allowed ``a historic
breakthrough,'' it said. ``Though the price we have had to pay is
great, all those years were not a lost time.''

   What appeared to be a prank call to the
police turned out to be a very wrong number for a drug dealer.
   ``It was kind of a humorous situation,'' said Ken Carter of the
Narcotics Division of the state's Department of Public Safety.
``Here we have this mope that's calling us and he has no idea of
who he is talking to.''
   Public Safety Commissioner Gene Shepard said it all began when
the phone rang in the agency's narcotics division.
   ``The guy said something like, `Is Al there?' and our agent
said, `No, this is John,''' said Shepard.
   The suspect then went on to describe a drug transaction that had
apparently been arranged with the mysterious Al. At first agents
thought it was a nuisance call, but the suspect became insistent,
Carter said.
   ``It proceeded to the point where we decided this guy was
serious, he really wanted to sell drugs,'' said Carter. ``So we
started with the role-playing.''
   After the agents went through the requisite haggling, a
transaction was set up allowing undercover agents to purchase a
small amount of marijuana.
   The buy was set up for Tuesday in Des Moines, and two men were
charged with delivery of marijuana. Carter said the transaction
involved about four ounces of the drug.
   `Once in a while, we have an interesting day around here,'' said
Shepard. ``It's not every day you arrest two people just on a wrong
number.''

   Two dozen Western nations that are
coordinating a massive aid package for Hungary and Poland on
Wednesday offered similar help to other East European nations
moving toward democracy and market economies.
   The foreign ministers of the 24 nations, ending a one-day
meeting, said they would ``respond positively'' to those nations
shedding communism.
   ``The 24 would welcome requests (for aid) from other states,''
the ministers said. They mentioned East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.
   The donor countries _ including the 12 European Community
nations, the United States, Japan, Australia and Canada _
``stressed the importance of the economic and political reform
process'' in the Soviet Union.
   But they did not overtly offer aid to Moscow. Sources said
Moscow may need more aid than any other East European nation, but
it would have been diplomatically unwise to put it on the list of
would-be recipient nations.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the meeting ``we
cannot ignore'' democratic reforms elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   These showed ``our efforts at coordinating Western responses are
addressing only the first phase of the challenge of economic and
political reform in Eastern Europe,'' he said.
   Western aid for Poland and Hungary is being coordinated by the
EC at the request of the leaders of the seven most industrialized
nations, who met in Paris in July well before the reform movements
in other East European nations began to take root.
   To date, officials said, aid totaling up to $6 billion over
several years has been granted or committed to Poland and Hungary.
It ranges from emergency food to long-term export and investment
credits.
   On Wednesday, the United States, West Germany, Japan and nine
other countries formally underwrote a stabilization fund of $1
billion to prop up the zloty, the Polish currency, and help make it
convertible.
   West Germany will pay $250 million to the fund, the United
States $200 million and Japan $150 million.
   Britain, France and Italy will each contribute $100 million and
the remainder will come from Canada, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland,
Austria and Turkey.
   Baker called the fund ``critical for the success of the currency
and price reforms'' in Poland.
   ``The fund is also taking on symbolic importance for the Poles,
an indicator of whether the West will in fact stand with them when
they make hard economic decisions,'' he added.
   He said in addition to paying into the stabilization fund, the
United States is granting Poland another $800 million in a range of
programs including investment credits, food and medical aid and
trade guarantees.
   Poland has a foreign debt of $40 billion. Hungary's is half
that, yet it is the highest per capita in Eastern Europe.
   The 24 donor nations also discussed a $1 billion loan to help
improve the Hungarian economy. Some are considering creating a
development bank for Eastern Europe.
   The Hungarian loan will be made once Budapest accepts
International Monetary Fund conditions to overhaul its economy
which would also free funds from the World Bank and other western
sources.
   Both Hungary and Poland are near an agreement with the IMF.
   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said Monday a letter of
intent for a $700 million loan agreement with Poland could be
initialed this week.
   The United States will put $200 million toward a $500 million
temporary loan for Poland as it awaits help from the IMF, the White
House said.
   Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski and Gyula Horn,
his Hungarian counterpart outlined to the western donors their
economic reforms.
   ``One of our most important aims is to shape a healthy ...

maintain the country's credit-worthiness and to assure access to

   Skubiszewski outlined his country's efforts to ``demonopolize''
the Polish economy ``by opening wider the doors to free
enterprise.''

<HEAD>Two Soldiers Killed and Third Injured In Attack on Security Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gang armed with guns and
bombs attacked a security post on the Irish border Wednesday,
killing two British soldiers and seriously injuring a third, police
said.
   The attackers escaped unhurt after the attack at Derryard, an
isolated checkpoint about two miles from the Fermanagh border with
County Monaghan in the Irish Republic, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said.
   No group claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on the Irish
Republican Army. The group is fighting to end British rule of
Northern Ireland and unite the mainly Protestant province with the
predominantly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   ``Quite clearly several terrorists were involved in this,'' said
a senior police officer, who by custom was not identified. ``It was
a well-staged attack.''
   Police said two soldiers died and another was taken to Erne
Hospital, Enniskillen. An army spokesman said the injured soldier
was treated for shrapnel wounds.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said nine
soldiers and one police officer were on duty at the checkpoint.
   The latest deaths brought to 12 the number of British soldiers
killed in Northern Ireland in 1989. Before the attack, 60 people
had been killed in sectarian violence in Northern Ireland this
year, 21 one them members of security forces.

<HEAD>Dog and Cat Returned To Owner In Rent Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iris the dog and Whitehill the cat, seized
last week in a dispute over back rent, were back home Wednesday,
freed by a judge who decreed they were being held hostage _ sort of.
   ``The nightmare is over!'' 31-year-old Lynell Zelenka said as
she hugged Iris and Whitehill.
   Civil Court Judge Thomas Early on Tuesday ordered the release of
Zelenka's 7-year-old Saluki and 11-year-old mixed-breed cat, which
were seized Dec. 6 along with her car as security for the overdue
rent.
   Her landlord, John Chambers, says Zelenka owes him $12,000,
which he agreed to let slide while she sued over a back injury.
Chambers claims she recently settled the lawsuit and didn't tell
him.
   But Zelenka, who admits owing Chambers $6,000, ended up with
only $750 after paying legal fees and medical expenses, Early was
told Tuesday.
   Early said he hasn't decided how much rent Zelenka owes, but
ruled that Zelenka's pets have value only to her and, unlike a cow
or a horse, would bring no money if put up for sale.
   The judge said taking Iris and Whitehill was a form of hostage
taking. ``Why should the dog and the cat be pulled into the middle
of this thing and deprived of the love of their master?'' he said.
   Chambers' attorney said he will appeal.
   Back home at the apartment, Zelenka said the first order of
business was a bath for Iris. She said she rode the bus to the
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals every day to take the
dog a daily ration of home-cooked chicken.
   ``I told her I'll spend the rest of her life making this up to
her,'' Zelena said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former chairman of Japan's largest company told
a court Wednesday he was engaging in a normal Japanese business
deal, not being bribed, when he accepted discount-priced stocks
from a firm accused of buying favors.
   The trial of Hisashi Shinto, 79, former chairman of Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp., which began Wednesday in Tokyo
District Court, is the fourth of five scheduled trials in the
Recruit bribery scandal.
   Defendants in the fifth trial, to begin Friday, are Hiromasa
Ezoe, founder and former chairman of the Recruit Co. information
services conglomerate, and two politicians accused of accepting
bribes. A total of 12 defendants are charged with bribery and could
face five years in prison each if convicted.
   Ezoe's company allegedly tried to win favors and influence in
the top ranks of politics, business and the bureaucracy. The
Recruit scandal and trials have raised many questions about
political gift-giving, business practices and the close ties
between government and business in Japan.
   Parliament gave final approval Wednesday to legislation
providing punishment for politicians who make donations at
weddings, funerals and other events in their election districts
without attending the event. Politicials have said constituents
expect such donations.
   Under the new law, which takes effect Feb. 1, violators can be
sentenced to a year in prison or fined up to 200,000 yen ($1,390).
   Shinto, who testified before Judge Ken Toyoda in the no-jury
trial, accepted the prosecution's factual allegations that he made
about 21 million yen ($145,000) in 1986 by buying shares in a
Recruit subsidiary at a below-market price before they were offered
to the public.
   ``I accepted the offer of shares, but I never regarded it as a
bribe,'' Shinto said. He added that, during his business career,
other companies had offered him similar shares as a sign of trust
and longterm ties.
   ``Rejecting such an offer is considered rude in Japan,'' he said.
   Shinto denied doing special favors for Recruit. The prosecution
alleged that Recruit got favorable terms on telephone lines,
maintenance and other services.
   ``The telecommunications market has become a free market and NTT
is a private company,'' Shinto said. ``I ordered all my employees
to increase our services to our clients, and I believe they did
just that.''
   Prosecutors also say Shinto helped Recruit obtain two U.S.-made
supercomputers and gave it special assistance. Recruit bought the
supercomputers from Shinto's company in 1987 and 1988 after NTT
bought them from Cray Research Inc.
   ``We were never asked by Recruit to buy supercomputers from
Cray, but rather it was done by NTT independently to correct the
trade imbalance between Japan and the United States, and NTT asked
Recruit to buy them from us,'' Shinto said.
   Japanese business circles were stunned by Shinto's arrest in
March. He had a reputation for clean dealings and had seen his
giant company through the change in 1985 from government to private
ownership.
   He resigned last December, immediately after his involvement in
the stock deal was disclosed.
   The Recruit scandal began in the summer of 1988 and caused the
downfall of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who resigned last
spring after acknowledging he received large donations from Recruit.
   Other key figures in the governing Liberal Democratic Party also
have been sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of ranking
bureaucrats also has been questioned because of gifts they accepted
from Recruit.

<HEAD>Famed Composer Calls on Leningrad Leader to Quit</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Congress, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A famed composer told Parliament on Wednesday that
the new Leningrad party chief is an opponent of President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reform and urged him to quit.
   Rodion Shchedrin took the floor on the second day of the
Congress of People's Deputies to criticize a widely publicized
meeting in the Soviet Union's second city last month that many
Soviets believe showed Leningrad party leader Boris V. Gidaspov to
be a conservative opponent to the president.
   ``I am of the opinion that the meeting was aimed at halting the
revolutionary processes of perestroika in the country, and there
were plenty of threats hidden by fig leaves of eulogisms addressed
against our leader and his supporters,'' Shchedrin said.
   ``I think that your post is incompatible with what you have
done,'' he said, addressing Gidaspov.
   Gidaspov was chosen Leningrad party leader this year to replace
Yuri F. Solovyev, who was embarrassed in elections to the Congress
in March. Solovyev had no opposition but still lost because he
received less than 50 percent of the vote.
   Gidaspov made an innocuous speech at the outdoor meeting, which
was shown on Leningrad TV and later on a nationwide news program,
saying mainly that it was time to stop talking about reform and
start acting.
   However, other speakers and some of the banners at the rally
gave Soviets a different picture. Some speakers sharply attacked
cooperatives, the small privately held businesses that are an
important feature of Gorbachev's economic reform. Banners called
for top Communist Party officials to be brought to account for the
country's difficult political and economic situation.
   Gidaspov denied he was leading the Leningrad party organization
toward opposing Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``To make such statements before the high assembly that are
based only on personal impressions seems to me not reasonable,'' he
said.
   ``We consider the work of the Leningrad party and public
organizations as work aimed at speeding up perestroika,'' he said.
   Gidaspov had come in for more heat about the outdoor meeting at
a ``countermeeting'' of 40,000 rank-and-file Leningrad Communists
last week. When he tried to make a conciliatory speech to that
meeting, he was drowned out by shouts of ``Resign! Resign!''

<HEAD>North Says He Doesn't Want to be Government Witness</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North said Wednesday that he does not
want to be a government witness in the Iran-Contra case against his
former boss, John Poindexter.
   Poindexter was ``the only one ... who didn't hang Ollie North
out to dry'' during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings, North
said at a pre-trial hearing in the case against the former national
security adviser.
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements in the
Iran-Contra affair.
   North, in seven hours of testimony over two days, said his
perceptions of the Iran-Contra affair had been influenced by
Poindexter's Capitol Hill testimony, given under a grant of
immunity. If U.S. District Judge Harold Greene agrees, North could
be barred from testifying.
   Defense lawyer Richard Beckler and Greene pressed the former
White House aide to provide specifics on how Poindexter's testimony
tainted his perceptions.
   ``I'm telling you I can't,'' North said, making it clear he
would prefer not to testify at Poindexter's trial, scheduled to
begin Jan. 22.
   ``I hoped I would never set foot in a courtroom ever again,''
North said when asked why he hadn't reviewed his trial testimony in
more detail before coming to court this week.
   ``This is the fourth Christmas that my family has had its door
darkened'' by the independent counsel's investigation and
prosecution of the Iran-Contra affair, North said.
   The former Marine lieutenant colonel was convicted in May of
three felonies in connection with the arms-for-hostages deal. He is
appealing that conviction.
   Greene said North ``is not a friendly witness, not to the
independent counsel. He may be (friendly) to the defense, but we
don't know that either.''
   Beckler will file court papers specifying instances in which
North gave different testimony or more detailed testimony at his
April trial compared with his 1987 congressional testimony. North's
congressional appearance preceded Poindexter's nationally televised
testimony.
   Questioning North closely, Beckler did bring out that his
recollection was affected by Poindexter's testimony in connection
with Poindexter tearing up a politically embarrassing policy
statement that depicted the Reagan administration's Iran initiative
as a straight arms-for-hostages deal.
   North said his memory of the event was colored by the fact that
Poindexter acknowledged in his congressional testimony that he had
destroyed the presidential document, known as a ``finding,'' Nov.
20, 1986, amid public scrutiny of the administration's arms sales
to Iran.
   The presidential finding ``could have been any sheet of paper
but for the fact that'' Poindexter ``confirmed it'' in his
congressional testimony, North told Beckler.
   ``I don't know for a fact ... that the document destroyed that
morning was the finding,'' North said later when questioned by
prosecutor Michael Bromwich.
   North testified at his own trial that he watched Poindexter rip
up the document as then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III began
focusing on a November 1985 CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk
anti-aircraft missiles to Iran.
   On Wednesday, however, North said that he hadn't actually read
the document when Poindexter destroyed it.
   The destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminal
charges against Poindexter, accused of falsely telling Congress
that he didn't learn of the missile shipment to Iran until January
1986.
   The finding, signed by President Reagan in December 1985, was
drafted because of the CIA-assisted shipment the previous month.

   Police raided the hideout of a
self-proclaimed Moslem saint whose followers captured one of their
colleagues, and at least 27 people died in the ensuing gunbattle
Wednesday, officials said.
   The captive officer and three other policemen were among those
killed in the fight that began late Tuesday in Pakundia village. It
ended at dawn Wednesday with the arrest of Matiur Rahman, a former
army major who now calls himself a Pir or saint, police officials
said.
   Twenty other people were wounded, said the officials in
Pakundia, about 50 miles north of Dhaka in Kishoreganj district.
   They said the raid was ordered to free the policeman held
captive by Rahman's supporters in the hideout, located in a
sprawling building complex. The policeman had gone to the hideout
Monday to investigate reports of ``anti-social activities by the
Pir's followers,'' an official said.
   He did not say what the anti-social activities were but it was
believed to be a reference to gambling and selling drugs.
   Rahman's 16 disciples also were arrested and 30 others
surrendered after the raid by about 700 policemen, they said.
   Earlier, at least 12 people were reported killed, but a search
team found 15 more bodies inside the hideout Wednesday, the
officials said.
   Self-proclaimed Pirs, who profess to cure physical ailments and
prescribe ways to becoming rich, abound in Bangladesh, a nation of
110 million people. About 88 percent of them are Moslems.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, a former army general, is a
follower of a popular god Hashmatullah, who claims to have
thousands of disciples. Hashmataullah is based at Atroshi in
Faridpur district, 40 miles west of Dhaka.
   Also Wednesday, about 2,000 journalists across Bangladesh went
on a 16-hour strike to protest a government ban on a daily
newspaper that supported anti-government strikes, the journalists'
union said.
   The ban on the Bengali-language Dainik Millat, which has a
circulation of 10,000, was imposed Tuesday.
   The government says frequent opposition-sponsored general
strikes are crippling the economy, and estimates the loss at about
$78 million for a day's work stoppage.
   Opposition parties demand Ershad's resignation, accusing his
administration of being corrupt and autocratic.
   Ershad, 59, has refused to step down and maintains he is willing
to hold elections without handing over power to a caretaker
government.
   Ershad took power in a bloodless coup in 1982. He resigned from
the army in 1985 and a year later was elected to a five-year
presidential term in national balloting that political opponents
and foreign observers said was tainted by widespread fraud.

<TEXT>
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner
said Wednesday he was ``fully in line'' with new U.S. proposals for
reshaping the Western alliance in an era of a reduced security
threat from the Soviet Union.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III advanced the
political proposals Tuesday in Berlin.
   Woerner spoke with reporters on the eve of a key meeting of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He said NATO foreign ministers
will discuss at their year-end meeting Thursday and Friday the
political and economic changes in East Europe, particularly in East
Germany and Czechoslovakia.
   Woerner said he strongly supported Baker's call for NATO to set
up an arms control verification staff, which would help Western
nations monitor compliance with future disarmament accords.
   ``We cannot and will not ignore that the historic change we see
all around us will have an impact on NATO itself,'' he said.
   The alliance ``must continue to provide security and stability
in a time of turbulence and ... must also be increasingly an
instrument that can shape political change,'' the NATO chief added.
   He said the ministers will be trying to encourage the reforms
under way in the East as part of efforts to fashion ``a new
architecture of Europe, which will allow the division of our
Continent to be peacefully overcome.''
   The meeting will cap weeks of high-level talks among the 16 NATO
nations. President Bush met with other alliance leaders last week
to brief them on his Malta discussions with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The alliance nations have been discussing ways to make sure NATO
keeps pace with the changes in the East. Bush and Baker have talked
about a New Europe and a New Atlanticism.
   In his Berlin speech, Baker said NATO's political role should be
enhanced as its military work diminishes.
   He said an agreement between NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
to reduce the buildup of conventional, or non-nuclear, weapons in
Europe was ``the keystone of this new security structure.''
   Woerner said NATO was determined to wrap up a conventional arms
treaty with the seven Warsaw Pact nations next year.
   The United States has been pressing for an agreement by June.
   Questions rose about the pace of the negotiations because of
Greek opposition to a compromise plan to exclude a Turkish port
from the area covered by the treaty. The snag has held up NATO
plans to quickly put on the negotiating table in Vienna a draft
treaty for bargaining with the Warsaw Pact.
   Woerner said work was continuing to reach a timely accord
despite the delay.
   He said the ministers ``will give further impetus'' at their
meeting to negotiations on the conventional armed forces in Europe.

<TEXT>
   The United States, Egypt and the PLO are
collaborating on a list of Palestinians who could be sent to
preliminary peace talks with Israel, an Israeli legislator said
Wednesday.
   Aryeh Eliav, a member of Parliament from the center-left Labor
Party, made the comment after returning from a meeting in Cairo
with officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The
officials included Nabil Shaat, a top political aide to PLO chief
Yasser Arafat.
   Eliav said the intensive efforts in Cairo are aimed at
submitting Palestinian names for Israeli approval in Washington
next month as a step toward the first direct formal negotiations
between Israelis and Palestinians.
   The Labor legislator is the first Israeli official to confirm a
report by the daily Yediot Ahronot on Sunday saying
behind-the-scenes peace contacts were under way, despite Israel's
insistence that the PLO be excluded from the process. Israel
considers the PLO a terrorist group and officially refuses to hold
talks with its members.
   Avi Pazner, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, has
denied Sunday's newspaper report. He also said Israeli Cabinet
Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein would go to Washington this week to
seek written U.S. guarantees that the PLO be excluded from peace
efforts.
   However, Eliav said Egypt and the PLO were already at work
drawing up lists of names to present to the Israeli and Egyptian
foreign ministers when they meet in January with U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   The Washington meeting called by Baker, for which no definite
date has been set, is supposed to set the stage for
Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo about an Israeli proposal to
hold elections in the occupied territories.
   ``There are some very, very intensive efforts under way in Cairo
involving Egypt, the Americans _ as advisers _ and the PLO, to
comprise a delegation that Israel can accept,'' Eliav said in a
telephone interview.
   Israel's denial of even indirect talks with the PLO is false,
Eliav added. ``Whoever thinks they are not partners, that they are
not involved in the process, is living in a fool's paradise, like
Alice in Wonderland,'' he said.
   Eliav said he met Shaat and the PLO ambassador in Cairo, Said
Kamal, during a two-day symposium on the Israeli-Palestinian
dispute sponsored by the Egyptian newspaper El Ahram.
   The PLO was ready to ``be flexible'' about Israeli demands,
Eliav said.
   ``I have the impression they understand they cannot allow
themselves the luxury of selecting only the people they want, and
that they are putting together a list Israel will find difficult to
oppose. People in the PLO know they must not miss this boat,''
Eliav added.
   He refused to provide names of prospective Palestinian
negotiators.
   The Israeli peace plan, introduced in April, calls for the 1.7
million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to
elect representatives to negotiate interim self-rule. The final
status of the territories would be negotiated later.
   The PLO has balked at accepting the plan because it does not
guarantee the Palestinians independent statehood.
   Eliav declined to elaborate on his talks with PLO officials amid
radio reports he could be questioned on suspicion of violating a
law that bars Israelis from meeting with PLO members. The lawmaker
said he had stayed within the bounds of the 1986 anti-terrorist law
because the meetings were held during a public conference.

<TEXT>
   White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu
confessed to the National Press Club on Wednesday that the Bush
administration has made a lot of mistakes, some of them unreported
``doozies.''
   Thus ended his confession.
   Sununu not only refused to shed light on the flubs, but devoted
most of an hour to a glowing review of the administration, five
weeks shy of its first birthday, that left practically no
superlative unsaid.
   He called George Bush ``probably the most underrated man in
modern history to serve in the presidency.''
   Sununu, who said his aim was to influence the journalists'
year-end analyses, said Bush is getting raves, too, in polls that
show his approval ratings in the mid-to-high 70s, ``numbers that
truly are virtually unprecedented in history.''
   From the savings and loan bailout to the war on drugs, Bush has
set the agenda and shown an ability to work with the
Democrat-controlled Congress without sacrificing his principles,
the former New Hampshire governor argued.
   Bush has ``really excelled'' in shaping and encouraging the
dramatic changes toward democracy in the Soviet bloc, Sununu said.
   ``It was not an easy year. George Bush just made it seem easy,''
said Sununu.
   He said Bush has resisted the temptation to make ``instant''
foreign policy or ``snap conclusions.''
   ``The one thing the president understands is that you don't get
extra credit for running out and doing it immediately on
television,'' he said.
   He has handled the East bloc changes ``as one would handle
landing a 10-pound fish on 2-pound line,'' avoiding the temptation
``to jerk that line and to try to pull the fish in all at once.''
   Sununu also hailed his boss as ``the master of the small
gesture,'' from inviting French President Francois Mitterrand to
his Kennebunkport, Maine, seaside home to taking Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak out to a baseball game to his ``countless hours on
the telephone'' with foreign leaders.
   Sununu even suggested that the lunch Bush held on his July visit
to Poland for both communist leaders and Solidarity members laid
the groundwork for the new Solidarity-led government in Poland.
That in turn, he said, ``served as the catalyst for the very rapid
change taking place in Eastern Europe.''
   Under questioning, Sununu defended Bush's controversial decision
to send two top aides to China last Saturday to rekindle ties with
that communist government, six months after a brutal crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Bush recognizes that ``there's a billion people there,'' and he
wanted ``to recreate a relationship that would allow whatever
pressures we put on to be taken (as) credible,'' said Sununu.
   Asked about the possibility of U.S. aid for East Germany, Sununu
said West Germany will be the first to help, and the NATO allies
will await evidence of internal changes before putting together any
aid package like the one crafted for Poland.
   The administration has seldom seen internal quarrels spill out
into the press, and Sununu was asked how the White House managed
that, a rare achievement in recent administrations.
   ``It has a calm, low-keyed mild-mannered chief of staff who
doesn't get upset at anything,'' said the imperious Sununu, evoking
laughter _ loudest from his own aides.
   Any regrets? ``We've made a lot of mistakes. A couple of them
you've caught. Most of them you haven't. ... There have been some
doozies that you missed.''
   Mmmmm. How about an example? His lips are sealed, and he added,
``I'm not even going to write a book.''

<HEAD>German, Crimean Tatars to Get Own Soviet Regions _ Eventually</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided to give ethnic Germans
and Crimean Tatars who were expelled from their homelands by Josef
Stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years, Tass
reported Wednesday.
   ``The ice has been broken. A start has been made. We're working
on creating such autonomy,'' said Rafik Nishanov, chairman of a
chamber of the Soviet legislature, in remarks carried by the
official news agency.
   However, he said, the nuts and bolts of how to create the
regions still had to be worked out. ``For example, a 10-year
program on resettlement. People can't just be expelled from the
area for others to move in.''
   The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who lived on the
Volga River were forcibly resettled during World War II, when Josef
Stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they
could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas.
   The Tatars and Germans, among others, long have been agitating
to return from Siberia and Central Asia to their traditional lands,
and last month the Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all
peoples exiled under Stalin should be considered politically
rehabilitated.
   But other people now occupy the lands and houses that belonged
to the exiles, and re-establishing their dominion in their home
regions will not be so simple.
   The Supreme Soviet took the basic decision that the two
autonmous regions should be created on Nov. 28 but kept it quiet,
apparently fearing explosive reactions from the populations now
living in the regions. It was also a potentially dangerous
precedent: The Soviet Union is a patchwork of well over 100 ethnic
groups, and many of them have outstanding territorial claims.
   Trouble already has been reported between ethnic Germans and
Russians in several cities on the Volga. Residents of the Saratov
and Volgograd regions have protested the prospect of seeing many of
the nation's estimated 2 million Germans descending on them.
   Ethnographers estimate there are some 500,000 Crimean Tatars in
the Soviet Union, and another 1 million in Turkey. Their protests
near the Kremlin in 1987 demanding to be allowed to return to their
homeland were among the first tests of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's promises of greater democracy.
   Several thousand Tatars have been filtering back to the Crimea
each year despite the lack of wholesale permission to return.
   A wave of some 100,000 ethnic Germans emigrated to West Germany
this year, but many would probably stay if they could be assured of
their own republic, said Irina Ostroukh, a researcher at the Soviet
Institute of Ethnography who studies ethnic Germans.
   The Nov. 28 plan approved by the Supreme Soviet recommended
excluding from the German region areas where resistance to German
resettlement was strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflicts.
   The explosive conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over
the Nagorno-Karabakh region has led to 200 deaths and hundreds of
thousands of refugees in the last two years. Both sides claim
control over the mountainous enclave.
   The Supreme Soviet charged the government with creating a
commmission to determine how to create the regions for the Germans
and Crimean Tatars.

<HEAD>Biden Urges $1 Billion to Develop Anti-Narcotics Medications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
called Wednesday for a $1 billion drive to develop anti-narcotics
medications, saying the Bush administration neglected that weapon
in its war on drugs.
   ``Like AIDS, drug abuse is a national health emergency that
threatens thousands of American lives and damages the fabric of
American society,'' Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., told a news
conference.
   ``While no one expects to find a magic pill that eliminates drug
addiction, expert researchers agree that we could be doing more _ a
lot more _ to develop new treatments,'' he said.
   Biden said the nation should set goals of making a
cocaine-blocking medicine available by 1997 and providing
``pharmacotherapeutic treatment-on-demand'' for heroin and cocaine
addicts by the year 2000.
   Biden said he would introduce legislation that would launch a $1
billion medications development program over the next decade,
provide drug companies with incentives to develop new treatments,
streamline government safety evaluations, call on the surgeon
general for a report on the issue and designate top priority
research areas.
   These top priority areas would include the use of
``pharmacotherapeutic'' agents on pregnant women and their fetuses,
treatments for new drugs that will appear in the 1990s and
interaction between heroin and cocaine addiction.
   Biden unveiled a report from the committee staff that pinpointed
eight new medicines that might be used to treat addiction. Some
reduce drug craving, while others merely substitute one addiction
for another. One actually blocks the pleasure addicts feel as a
result of taking their drug.
   The report said slow Food and Drug Administration procedures
combined with pharmaceutical industry inaction and insufficient
action by the administration to limit resources devoted to
searching for new treatments.

   Long-feuding neighbors Egypt and Libya have
agreed to build roads linking the two nations, share television
programs, and cooperate on farm and industrial projects, news
reports said Wednesday.
   Broad agreement was reached on most of the projects during an
October summit between President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi.
   Egypt's government-owned news media reported Wednesday that the
two leaders reaffirmed the decisions Tuesday during Mubarak's
one-day visit to Sirte on Libya's north coast.
   Egypt and Libya had been bitter enemies since Mubarak's
predecessor, Anwar Sadat, shunned efforts by Gadhafi to unify their
countries in 1972.
   Rapprochement between the North African neighbors began in May
at an Arab League summit in Morocco. Relations have improved
quickly since then, and Tuesday's meeting was the fourth summit
between Mubarak and Gadhafi.
   The only document they reportedly signed Tuesday provides that
Egypt supply technical expertise for Libyan industry.
   News reports initially said the two leaders agreed that Libya
join in an Arab-European dialogue in Paris on Dec. 21-22 and
coordinate its positions with Egypt.
   But the early editions of Thursday newspapers in Cairo later
quoted the Libyan leader as saying the issue was still under
discussion by Libyan officials.
   French President Francois Mitterrand called for the Paris
meeting to allow the foreign ministers of the 22 Arab League
members and the 12 member states of the European Community to focus
on Arab problems.
   As reported by the government-owned Middle East News Agency,
other Libyan-Egyptian projects include Egyptian help for desert
reclamation projects in southeastern Libya and construction of an
80-mile road connecting Siwa Oasis in Egypt's western desert with
the Jaghbub Oasis in eastern Libya.
   They also agreed on cooperation in electricity distribution and
television programming.

   Jennifer Casolo's friends and parents
expressed gratitude and relief Wednesday at the news that the
church worker was being released from the Salvadoran prison where
she'd been held on terrorism charges.
   ``I am deeply, greatly grateful to each and every one who has
believed in Jennifer and her innocence,'' her mother, Audrey
Casolo, told a news conference in U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd's
Whethersfield office just south of Hartford.
   Casolo, 28, was arrested Nov. 26 after a raid on her house in
San Salvador, and was accused of storing weapons for leftist
rebels. Police said they found thousands of rounds of Soviet-made
ammunition and other armaments in the garden behind her home.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Christiani announced Wednesday that
Casolo, 28, had been released because of insufficient evidence and
would be deported. Shortly afterwards, reporters saw the Thomaston
native leave Ilopango prison with U.S. Ambassador William Walker.
   ``You don't know whether to laugh because you're happy or cry
because you're happy,'' said Susanna Wallace of the Christian
Education Seminar in San Antonio, the lay church group that sent
Casolo to the Central American country in 1985.
   ``We hope this helps stop the persecution of church workers
that's going on in El Salvador,'' Wallace said, weeping as she
spoke. ``This confirms our standing all along of her innocence.''
   In Whethersfield, Casolo's father, John, thanked volunteers and
officials ``for bringing our daughter home.''
   In Thomaston, a western Connecticut town of 7,000 people, the
initial shock and disbelief over Casolo's arrest 2{ weeks ago was
replaced by an effort to win her freedom.
   A hastily arranged prayer vigil drew 250 people and raised
$1,000, teachers started a legal defense fund and other organized a
letter- and Christmas card-writing drive.
   Word of Casolo's release spread quickly at Thomaston High
School, where Casolo was student body president 10 years ago.
   ``All the faculty here are extremely elated that she'll be
coming back home to us,'' said teacher Walter Robinson. ``Word got
around very very quickly, from room to room to room.''
   A decade ago, Casolo was a cheerful, popular high school senior
more interested in cheering on the basketball team than changing
the world.
   Casolo, who came from a working class-family, finished at the
top of her class, and honors came easily to her. In addition to
being chosen student body president, she was the yearbook editor
and was voted most ambitious, most creative and ``did the most for
Thomaston High School.''
   ``She was the hit of the school,'' Edward Wilkinson, now a vice
principal at the school, said Tuesday. ``She was very intelligent,
inquisitive, a bundle of energy. If anything needed to be started
for school spirit or something, she would always do it.''
   Friends described her as a compassionate, caring teen-ager, but
said there was little sign of the spirituality Casolo would find
working among El Salvador's poor.
   Her parents divorced while she was a student. Her mother
supported the family by working as a bookkeeper at a vocational
high school in Waterbury.
   Friends say Casolo became more religious and more interested in
social work while at Brandeis University, a prestigious liberal
arts college in Waltham, Mass.
   She took a double major in American studies and Latin American
studies, was captain of the soccer team and graduated summa cum
laude.
   Friends say Casolo experienced anxiety about choosing a career,
torn between an attraction to social work and a feeling of
obligation to find a well-paying job to help her mother.
   Social work won out. After working with Salvadoran refugees in
Seattle, Casolo, who is fluent in Spanish, left for El Salvador.
She worked for Christian Education Seminars, which organizes visits
for prominent Americans to El Salvador.
   ``I think that she was something she felt called to do rather
than simply take a job and make a lot of money,'' said Susan
Abbott, a close friend from high school.
   The work put her in close contact with a wide range of
Salvadorans, from President Christiani and military leaders to
church leaders and opposition party politicians.
   Casolo quickly formed a spiritual attachment to the country and
its people, particularly the poor.
   In a letter to a friend, she spoke of joining the Catholic
Church to become a nun. In another letter, she wrote, ``I'm a
pastor without religion. Only with lots of love.''
   Even after her arrest, Casolo remained upbeat, shouting her
claims of innocence to U.S. reporters at her arraignment and
describing her imprisonment as a ``life-changing experience.''
   ``I can't say I have faith in the system to find me innocent,''
she said. ``But I believe my innocence will shine through.''

<HEAD>New Brief Asks Wider Ethics Probe of D'Amato</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mark Green, whose complaint led to the
congressional investigation of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, asked the
Senate Ethics Committee Wednesday to widen its probe to include a
HUD grant and D'Amato phone calls to a federal prosecutor.
   Green, a Democrat who lost the Senate race to D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
in 1986, also said potential witnesses in the investigation should
be subpoenaed to testify under oath.
   ``There are a lot of people with information who will be scared
to speak out against D'Amato, given his reputation for
ruthlessness, unless the committee puts them under oath, which in a
sense protects them,'' Green said in an interview. He also said
D'Amato should be put under oath.
   D'Amato said later he would testify before the committee ``in
any way in which they request. And I'm delighted to make myself
available and to cooperate with them in every way and any way.''
   At a Manhattan news conference on another issue, D'Amato said he
was unaware of Green's latest move, ``but it wouldn't surprise
whatever it is, and I'm delighted that we'll have an opportunity to
have all of Mr. Green's charges reviewed by the Ethics Committee.''
   He said he was confident he would be exonerated.
   Green, who currently runs the Democracy Project, a liberal
research organization in New York, said he filed the additional
papers because the committee's special counsel, Henry Schuelke III,
asked him for ``any new information, insights.''
   The phone calls Green referred to were made by D'Amato to
then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani in 1984 and 1985. On one
occasion, D'Amato passed along a plea from the Rev. Louis Gigante
for a reduction in the sentence of his brother, Mario Gigante, a
convicted loan shark who also has been reported to be an officer in
the Genovese crime family.
   D'Amato has said he was merely trying to help the priest, a
constituent.
   In the other call, made at the behest of the late criminal
lawyer Roy Cohn, D'Amato urged Giuliani to review murder charges
against an unnamed defendant. Giuliani has said he later concluded
D'Amato was referring to Paul Castellano, then boss of the Gambino
crime family.
   D'Amato has said he was unaware of the identity of the defendant
in the latter case and that he was trying to save Giuliani's office
from being embarrassed if the charges didn't stick.
   The HUD grant was $500,000 from a discretionary fund controlled
by then-Secretary Samuel Pierce. The money was awarded to a
coalition of black ministers, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose
National Youth Movement was to use the money to rehabilitate a
building into a drug treatment center. The grant came one month
after the group endorsed D'Amato for re-election in 1986.
   Sharpton, who is under indictment accused of stealing $250,000
from his organization, has said, ``If we hadn't endorsed D'Amato, I
don't think (Bishop Frederick D. Washington) would have had access
to D'Amato and any funding.''
   D'Amato spokeswoman Zenia Mucha has said that the senator did
not know of Sharpton's role in the project. After Washington died
last January, the project was dropped.
   Green filed his original complaint against D'Amato last July,
and followed up with an addendum in September. He has charged that
D'Amato misused his influence to steer federal favors to political
contributors and friends.

   Spencer Abraham, chairman of the Michigan
Republican Party, Wednesday was appointed deputy chief of staff to
Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Abraham, 37, will act as Quayle's chief political liaison with
GOP leaders nationwide and will oversee management and operation of

takes effect Jan. 9.
   Abraham will retain his position as Michigan GOP chairman, which
he has held since 1983, but he will relinquish day-to-day party
operations to Executive Director David Doyle.
   When he took over, the party faced a $450,000 debt from lengthy
reapportionment battles and the 1982 election, in which Democrats
siezed control of all statewide offices. Supporters credit Abraham
with erasing the debt and improving the state party's technical and

   Companies that build planes, spacecraft and
related equipment have too few skilled workers, as U.S. schools lag
behind in science and math, an industry study concluded Wednesday.
   A survey of companies belonging to the Aerospace Industries
Association showed 67 percent of the companies suffer from a
shortage of scientists and engineers and 55 percent report a
shortage of production workers. More than 80 percent said they
expect more shortages in the future.
   The problem is made more serious by rapid changes in the
technology needed in aerospace industries, by a lack of young
people preparing for jobs with a technological focus, by the
failure of women and minorities to choose such careers and by the
fact that U.S. students generally are doing poorly in science and
math, said the AIA study.
   The survey was compiled from responses of 30 major corporations,
including nine of the top 10 Defense Department contractors and
eight of the top 10 National Aeronautics and Space Administration
contractors.
   Key shortages are occurring in jobs that involve computers,
advanced materials, electro-optics and artificial intelligence, the
study said.
   Among concerns raised by aerospace companies are that employees
have insufficient hands-on experience, that schools put too much
emphasis on theoretical models, that there is a lack of emphasis on
design projects in college, and that people with advanced degrees
are academically oriented and have to adjust to the faster pace of
industry.
   Some companies also complained of deficiences in verbal and
team-building skills among high-level professionals.
   Aerospace companies are responding to the problem by giving
almost 40 percent of their total corporate contributions to
education up to the high school level, with large amounts going to
colleges and universities for research and development projects,
the report said.
   A November report by the American Association of State Colleges
and Universities concluded that the nation faces a crisis in
science education, with schools producing an inadequate number of
science and engineering graduates.

<HEAD>Carter to Investigate Nicaraguan Political Campaign Riot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter said
Wednesday he will investigate a political campaign battle between
government opponents and supporters this week that left one person
dead and more than 20 injured.
   ``We hope to determine the causes of this violence,'' he told
reporters.
   Carter arrived at the head of a delegation of observers, invited
by both the leftist Sandinista government and the opposition, to
monitor the process leading to national elections Feb. 25. It was
his second trip here this year.
   Sandinistas and leaders of the National Opposition Union accused
each other of inciting the Dec. 10 riot in Masatepe, 30 miles south
of Managua, in which a Sandinista campaign office and a private
home were looted and two vehicles were burned.
   It was the worst outbreak of violence in the 2-month-old
election campaign for president, vice president, a new legislature
and municipal authorities nationwide.
   The Center for Democracy, a Washington-based observer group,
blamed the Sandinistas. A report by the Organization of American
States said the riot was deliberately provoked but that its
observers could not determine who was responsible.
   Carter said he is pleased that so far all sides are intent on
having free and fair elections.
   Accompanying Carter was his wife Rosalynn; former Sen. Daniel
Evans, R-Wash.; and former President Daniel Oduber of Costa Rica.
For the next three days they will travel throughout Nicaragua,
talking to OAS and United Nations observer groups about the
electoral process.
   Carter said he would like to see the money approved by the U.S.
Congress for Nicaragua's Contra rebels channeled through a
commission set up to oversee their demobilization.
   He stopped short of calling for demobilization of the Contras
before the elections, saying, ``My hope is there will be no need
for a Contra presence after the elections.''
   Carter was commenting on this week's summit by five Central
American presidents that called for disbanding the Contras and
leftist Salvadoran guerrillas.
   The Bush administration and Contra leaders want the Contras to
remain in place as a fighting force until after the elections to
make sure President Daniel Ortega keeps his promise the electoral
process will be open and fair.
   The five presidents agreed Aug. 7 in Tela, Honduras, to call for
demobilization of the Contras by Dec. 5 in exchange for Ortega's
promise of electoral fairness. But Contra leaders ignored the
deadline and Central American leaders passed it by after violence
re-escalated in El Salvavador 10-year-old civil war.

<HEAD>White House Denies China Ties With President's Brother</HEAD>

   The White House on Wednesday denied any
association between President Bush's brother, who has business
dealings in China, and U.S. consideration of easing a satellite
trade ban against Beijing.
   The president and Prescott Bush of Connecticut, who visited
China last February on business, are ``unaware of any association
involving Hughes aircraft,'' the contractor that is building three
satellites for launch by the Chinese, said White House spokesman
Steve Hart.
   Bush is considering lifting a ban on satellite exports to China,
a sanction he imposed because of Beijing's violent crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators last spring.
   Affected would be three communications satellites that are being
manufactured by Hughes and are to be launched in joint ventures by
China.
   Administration officials have said the ban on satellite export
might be lifted because Bush meant to restrict military trade, not
commercial ventures.
   The president's brother is a business consultant to Asset
Management International Financing &amp; Settlement of New York, an
international merchant bank that arranges financing and other
services for firms doing multinational business.
   Stanley Scheinman, executive vice president of the firm, said
Bush's decision on the satellite matter ``is not relevant to our
business plans.''
   The president's brother did not return a reporter's Wednesday
calls to his New York office.
   Scheinman said it was ``pretty far out'' to suggest that a
decision to resume the satellite transfers would benefit Prescott
Bush or the Asset Management firm.
   However, he acknowledged that ``future telecommunications
capacity established anywhere in the world'' to technology starved
countries like the Soviet Union and China ``would benefit any
telecommunications interest,'' such as a client Asset Management is
working with.
   That company, Sino Trade, is involved in a venture with a
Chinese group to link data bases that are scattered all over China.
   Scheinman contended the firm already has its plans for a
communications network using all existing telecommunications
avenues, including telephone lines, microwave, and an existing
satellite. Thus, said Scheinman, Sino Trade is not concerned about
whether more satellites are brought in.
   However, The Washington Times on Wednesday quoted an official of
Sino Trade as saying that Bush's decision on the Hughes satellites
could augment Sino Trade's project although the company would not
be dependent on it.
   The official, Richard Wall, told The Los Angeles Times that the
Hughes satellites would offer a better communications link than the
domestic one in China.
   Hart said the president's brother ``has been very careful in his
dealings. ... He is cognizant of his brother's position and has
been, in the past, outspoken that there is no relationship in his
business dealings with those of the government or the president.''
   Prescott Bush traveled through Japan, South Korea and China in
search of business for his own development consulting firm last
February. The president also visited those same countries later.
   The president's brother said at the time he saw no conflict of
interest and stated he has a policy against doing business with the
U.S. government or lobbying the government.

   Gunner's mate Kendall Truitt told Congress
Wednesday former USS Iowa crew mate Clayton Hartwig was no
``suicidal freak'' and didn't cause the explosion that killed
Hartwig and 46 other sailors.
   Truitt accused the Navy of using ``a big coverup'' to thwart
theories that the shipboard explosion was accidental rather than
caused intentionally, ``most likely'' by Hartwig, as the Navy has
concluded.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on investigations, also has been critical of
the Navy's report. And at the end of the hearing he told Vice Adm.
Joseph S. Donnell III, ``You've pointed your finger when there's
that little chance'' that the explosion was accidental.
   ``Wouldn't you have been better off to say we don't know?'' the
congressman asked.
   Donnell said the Navy believes ``we do know'' that Hartwig most
likely caused the explosion.
   Truitt said Hartwig wasn't told until the morning of April 19
that he was going to be positioned at center gun in the No. 2 gun
turret, ``so there would have been no time for planning'' a suicide
explosion. He said Hartwig had once talked of suicide, but Truitt
said he did not take him seriously.
   Truitt said his own theory is that the blast was caused by a
defective hydraulic rammer _ the piece of equipment used to shove
the powder bags up against the projectile in the huge gun.
   He said he had had a problem with a rammer on the left gun in
No. 2 gun turret about a year earlier, describing it as behaving
like a transmission stuck between neutral and drive. He theorized
that the rammer might have ``suddenly taken off,'' putting too much
pressure on the propellant.
   He also maintained that gunpowder on the Iowa had been stored in
high heat, that the cans were not airtight, and that ``you could
smell ether'' when entering a powder storage area. Truitt said the
fact that the crew mates working closest to the center gun had not
gone through the exercise together before ``may have been a
contributing factor'' in the explosion.
   Questioned about his personal relationship with Hartwig, Truitt
said they had a basically strong friendship, with occasional
quarrels. Under questioning, he denied they had ever been
homosexual lovers.
   The Navy's official report on the Iowa accident Sept. 7 made no
mention of a possible homosexual link between the two, although
there had been earlier news reports that Naval Investigative Agents
were pursuing such a theory.
   Truitt said he thought other Iowa crewmen spread rumors about
the two because they didn't drink and spent a lot of time with each
other. ``I knew it wasn't true, and it didn't bother me,'' he said.
``He knew it wasn't true. It bothered him.''
   Petty Officer John Mullahy, who served on the Iowa beginning
last December and was in the same division as Hartwig, said of the
two men: ``From the time I was on board, they weren't talking to
each other. ... They hated each other.''
   Yet, Hartwig never had Truitt removed as the beneficiary on
Hartwig's $101,000 life insurance policy. Truitt said that in
settlement of the policy claim, he gave Hartwig's family $2,500,
his lawyer $40,000, and kept the rest.
   Truitt also revealed that he was named as beneficiary on a life
insurance policy taken out by another sailor friend who is assigned
to the USS Roosevelt. He said he saw nothing particularly unusual
about such arrangements.
   The gunner's mate sat alone at the witness table in his Navy
uniform. His wife of one year sat in the first row of the public
seats.
   He said there would have been no reason for Hartwig to think he
would be in the gun turret on the day of the fatal explosion last
April.
   ``He was off the watch list'' for the gun-firing exercise,
Truitt said. ``He was expecting his (next) assignment to be in
London.''
   The gunner's mate described the last seconds before shipboard
blast off the coast of Puerto Rico.
   Truitt was part of the crew engaged in the firing exercise,
passing gun powder bags from a storage room to the center gun where
the shooting was to take place. He said the overheard last words of
Petty Officer Eric Lawrence, who was in center gun position with
Hartwig, would have been far different if the explosion had been
intentionally caused.
   ``He wouldn't have had as his last words, `I'm not ready yet.
We've got a problem in here,''' Truitt said of Lawrence. ``He would
have said, `Hey, excuse me guys, he put a bomb in here.' If Clay
was going to blow up the ship, Lawrence would have stopped him.
They were literally standing shoulder to shoulder.''
   The Navy has concluded that Hartwig ``most likely'' caused the
explosion by inserting some type of detonator between bags of
gunpowder in the gun, whose barrel has a 16-inch diameter. But it
has acknowledged that the cause of the explosion likely will never
be solved beyond a doubt because everyone near the gun was killed.
   ``Clayton Michael Hartwig did not cause the explosion,'' said
Truitt. ``I do not think he committed suicide. I believe the report
is very misleading.''
   ``It's a big coverup, in my opinion,'' he said. ``Clayton
Hartwig was not the suicidal freak they make him out to be.''
   Navy officers have said that while some safety lapses were
discovered in the course of the investigation, there was no
substantial risk involving the 16-inch guns and the powder used to
fire them. The captain of the Iowa, Fred Moosally, testified
earlier in the week he would not have allowed firing to resume six
weeks after the accident if he had lingering safety concerns.

   The party that took Todor Zhivkov's
orders for 35 years expelled him Wednesday, and his replacement as
leader exhorted Communists to prepare for ``a nationwide exam'' in
free elections promised for May.
   The policy-making Central Committee also agreed to join other
Warsaw Pact parties in surrendering its constitutional guarantee of
supreme power. Members made the decisions in a three-day discussion
of reform, while tens of thousands of people stood outside to
remind them promises must be kept.
   Petar Mladenov, who became party chief when Zhivkov was forced
out Nov. 10, said Monday that free elections should be held in May.
On Tuesday, he told the Communist leadership:
   ``We have to ... conquer _ this time in the real sense of the
word _ the hearts and minds of the millions of Bulgarians.
   ``Soon we will face a nationwide exam: free and democratic
elections ... and it is there we must show that we are not only
worthy of, but also practically capable of, leading'' the country.
   Some of Mladenov's remarks at the closing session of a three-day
meeting were carried by BTA, the official news agency.
   BTA reported the expulsions from the party of Zhivkov; his son,
Vladimir; and Milko Balev, a close associate of the former leader.
Zhivkov, 78, has come under increasing attack for alleged
mismanagement and corruption, as well as his dictatorial rule.
   The news agency said the Central Committee would propose to
Parliament on Thursday that it remove two constitutional clauses in
which the party is given sole power.
   One defines the party as ``the leading force'' in society and
the state, and the other says the party ``heads the construction of
an advanced socialist society.''
   As the Central Committee meeting drew to a close, a crowd
estimated by Western reporters at 60,000 gathered in the plaza
outside to show support in a rally sponsored by the party.
   Mladenov, who served 18 years as foreign minister under Zhivkov,
told the crowd: ``Our party does not need a law to guarantee its
leading role. It is the people who decide.''
   Signs hoisted above the throng said ``A Bulgarian Communist
Party of Untainted People,'' and ``Together with the Bulgarian
Communist Party for New Democratic Communist Socialism.''
   Nearby, outside the Alexander Nevski Orthodox Cathedral, about
2,000 people applauded a speaker from the Agrarian Union party who
declared: ``Today we end this semi-existence.''
   The speaker, not identified, was referring to the subservient
role given the Agrarian Union, the only other legal party the
Communists allowed.
   Mladenov has moved swiftly to oust Zhivkov's associates from the
ruling party Politburo in favor of people more likely to embrace
reform.
   In a speech to the Central Committee on Monday, Mladenov said
the party should start talks with independent groups immediately
and relinquish the guarantee of sole power, as has been done in
Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. He proposed that
free elections be held by May.
   Zhivkov was removed from the Central Committee last week and his
son was kicked out of the committee and all other party posts in
November. The former party leader has been accused publicly of
living lavishly in a workers' state, in 13 opulent official
residences and six hunting lodges.
   Officials have said the residences and lodges will be turned
over to the public.
   Balev, who was Zhivkov's private secretary for many years, was
ousted from the Politburo soon after the downfall of his boss.
   Andrei Lukanov, considered second in the new hierarchy after
Mladenov, told the Central Committee on Wednesday ``there are full
grounds for detailed investigation of the income and expenses'' of
Zhivkov and his family, BTA reported.
   Lukanov heads a new party committee on corruption that is
investigating ``financial and other violations by ... Zhivkov, his
family and his closest circle; cases of profiteering; cases of
corruption and the abuse of power for personal favors,'' and other
allegations, BTA said.
   Many speakers at the Tuesday committee session criticized
Zhivkov and said anyone associated with him who remains in power
should resign or be dismissed.
   Politburo member Alexander Lilov demanded Zhivkov and close
associates be punished and asked how the system could allow
``dictators'' to rule so long.
   On Sunday, more than 50,000 people demonstrated in Sofia,
chanting calls for reform and dialogue between the Communists and
opposition. It was the largest pro-democracy display since the
Communists consolidated power in 1946.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega tightened
his grip on power Wednesday, reshuffling his Defense Forces on the
eve of a meeting by the legislature to discuss naming him chief of
state.
   A foe said this would mean ``the beginning of a fascist
dictatorship.''
   A Defense Forces communique announced the promotion of 49
officers, four of them to the rank of lieutenant colonel,
automatically making them members of the general staff.
   On Thursday, the 510-member legislature dominated by Noriega is
to discuss a proposal by his supporters to name him chief of
government with powers greater than those of provisional President
Francisco Rodriguez.
   The so-called Popular Power Assembly was formed by Rodriguez and
is made up of representatives of mayors and county council
chairmen. It replaces the single-house National Legislature vacated
Sept. 1
   Noriega annulled May 7 elections for a new president,
legislature and other offices when returns showed opposition
candidates were winning by a landslide. He later named Rodriguez, a
longtime crony, as provisional president.
   Noriega recently was named coordinator of the assembly.
   As chief of government, he would have total authority over the
country, since he will also be retaining his present job of Defense
Forces chief.
   Rodriguez's job would be reduced to a ceremonial post.
   ``This would be the beginning of a fascist dictatorship that
gives civilian and military power to a single chief,'' Ricardo
Arias Calderon, head of the opposition Christian Demcoratic Party,
said of Noriega's latest move.
   ``He can name himself emperor. ... We know he is the one who
rules and decides everything,'' Guillermo Endara, another
opposition leader, said.
   Endara and Arias ran as presidential and vice presidential
candidates in the May 7 elections annulled by Noriega.
   The general, who survived two coup attempts in as many years,
was indicted in Florida in February 1988 on U.S. drug-trafficking
and money-laundering charges. He denies the charges.
   Since then, U.S. economic sanctions against Panama along with
diplomatic pressure have failed to force him out of power.
   Senior officers attempted coups to overthrow Noriega on March
16, 1988, and on Oct. 3 but failed to remove him. More than 10
people were killed in the last attempt.
   Among those promoted to lieutenant colonel were Maj. Rafael
Cedeno, the chief of state security, and police chief Maj. Anibal
Maylin.
   Among those still under arrest after the October coup are three
former members of the general staff _ Col. Guillermo Wong, the
ex-intelligence chief, Col. Julio Ow Joung and Lt. Col. Armando
Palacios Gondola.

<HEAD>Jordanian Prince Worried That Middle East Now Low Priority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Hassan of Jordan said on Wednesday he
is worried Middle East peace efforts may get low priority as the
western world focuses on the sweeping changes in Eastern Europe.
   Following his half-hour Oval Office visit with President Bush
the prince said that Jordan backs the East European moves toward
political freedom and economic reform, but added:
   ``As we look at peacemaking in the Middle East region, we hope
that the Middle East does not slip on the international agenda. And
that certainly is a concern of many people in our part of the world
share.''
   ``It's been valuable to speak to the president during this
period of world transition and to state our concern and our
commitment for lasting peace in our region,'' he said.
   Hassan voiced an optimistic note for the future saying, ``I
would expect the new year period would be an interesting one for
all concerned in the region.''
   The meeting focused on the recent parliamentary elections in
Jordan as well, White House spokesman Steve Hart said.
   The meeting came at a time when Jordan's King Hussein has felt
slighted by the United States, especially over congressional
reluctance to approve arms sales for his country.
   U.S. officials have said they would like to encourage him to
have a more active role in the peace process as Secretary of State
James A. Baker III pushes regional peace talks.
   Hart said Bush regards Jordan as ``a key player in the region
and a valued friend for the United States,'' and sent his thanks
through the prince to Hussein for helping peace efforts.
   Jordan generally supports the Palestine Liberation
Organization's positions on the evolving peace efforts in the
Mideast.
   Egypt, on behalf of the PLO, has conditionally accepted a
five-point plan advanced by Baker. It is expected to lead to talks
in Washington next month with the United States and the foreign
ministers of Egypt and Israel, aimed at laying the groundwork for
talks between Israeli and Palestinian representatives.
   The plan calls for elections among the Palestinians who live in
Israel-occupied West Bank, to choose representatives for limited
self-rule to last for five years.
   After that, Egypt, Jordan, Israel and the Palestinans would hold
talks on overall settlement.

<HEAD>Oil Executive Criticizes Foreign Oil Leasing Idea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent oil executive suggested Wednesday
the Energy Department drop consideration of a plan to cut the cost
of building U.S. emergency oil reserves by leasing, rather than
buying, oil from foreign producers.
   ``I have a little problem with going with hat in hand'' to OPEC
or other foreign producers to, in effect, ask for help in filling
the emergency reserve, Pete Silas, chairman of Phillips Petroleum
Co., told a department hearing.
   ``If it's a good program, it ought to be funded'' by U.S.
taxpayers, he added.
   Silas said putting leased OPEC oil in the U.S. Strategic
Petroleum Reserve would only add complications in the event of a
serious U.S. dispute with a leasor country.
   ``It may end up in a confrontation where you'd have to
nationalize'' the leased oil, Silas said.
   The Phillips chairman was responding to questions from Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins, who told Silas his department was
considering a variety of ways of reducing the cost of filling the
oil reserve, which now hold 580 million barrels of oil in a series
of underground salt domes in Louisiana and Texas.
   Watkins indicated his department, in considering the oil reserve
question as part of a broader national energy strategy, had not yet
decided whether the less costly leasing option would enhance or
detract from U.S. energy security.
   The department had disclosed earlier this year that Saudi
Arabia, the No. 1 foreign supplier of oil to the U.S. market, had
expressed interest in leasing oil for the emergency reserve,
although no specific proposals had been discussed.
   Watkins told Wednesday's hearing ``many nations of the world are
approaching us rather aggressively'' about participating in a
leasing program. He did not name any of the countries.
   Donald E. Milsten, director of the Maryland Energy Office and
vice chairman of the National Association of State Energy Offices,
told Watkins his association was concerned about the leasing idea
but had not yet formed a firm opinion.
   The strategic reserve ``might not be seen as a serious defense
mechanism'' in an oil supply emergency if part of the stockpile was
leased rather than owned by the U.S. government, Milsten said.

   Israeli troops shot and wounded at least 10
Palestinians on Wednesday in clashes throughout the occupied lands,
Arab journalists and hospital officials said.
   The army meanwhile reported finding a cache of knives, axes and
PLO flags outside a building housing Red Cross relief officials in
Nablus in the occupied West Bank. News reports said the weapons
were put there by a Palestinian gang.
   Nablus is a center of anti-Israeli unrest.
   ``Something seemed suspicious about the house, and we went into
the yard and underneath some leaves found a knife, and then axes,
PLO flags and all sorts of equipment,'' said an Israeli soldier on
Israel television.
   TV said the weapons apparently belonged to a Palestinian gang
who took advantage of immunity the army granted to the apartment
grounds used by the Red Cross.
   Repeated phone calls to the the Red Cross went unanswered, but
an army spokesman said the group denied any connection to the
weapons and praised the army's action.
   The find came as Nablus merchants observed the second day of a
three-day strike in memory of four Palestinian activists slain by
troops on Dec. 1, Israel television said.
   The brother of one of the slain activists was shot and wounded
Wednesday as troops searched his Nablus home, Arab reporters said.
   Nine other Palestinians were wounded in clashes around the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed one Palestinian wounded in Nablus and said
the military was investigating the other reports.
   At least 631 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during
the two-year Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule. Forty-three
Israelis have also died, and Palestinians have killed 155 of their
fellow Arabs on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities.

<HEAD>Series Of Cold Fronts Pump Arctic Air Deep Into Central U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest in a series of arctic cold fronts ushered strong
northerly wind and frigid temperatures into the central Plains and
the middle Mississippi Valley on Wednesday.
   Temperatures in the north-central states plunged during the
night and Wednesday morning lows were 10 to 20 degrees below zero
across North Dakota and northern Minnesota.
   Temperatures were still below zero by early afternoon Wednesday
across much of North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota, and wind
chill readings were 30 to 45 degrees below zero.
   The south-central states were still feeling the effects of the
previous arctic blast which swept down at the start of the week.
Temperatures fell below freezing in the lower Rio Grande Valley of
Texas and along the western and central Gulf of Mexico coast.
   Record lows were 22 at Austin, Texas; 30 at Brownsville, Texas;
4 at Calico, Ark.; 19 at College Station, Texas; 25 at Corpus
Christi, Texas; 11 at El Paso, Texas; 19 at Houston; 11 at Ozark,
Ark.; 25 at Victoria, Texas; and 18 at Waco, Texas.
   Lows as warm as the 50s and 60s on Wednesday were confined to
southern and central Florida.
   A frost advisory was issued for some of the agricultural areas
of southern California.
   Snow developed along the arctic front across the central part of
the nation. Snow fell over the middle and upper Mississippi Valley
during the afternoon, and snow lingered over parts of the central
high Plains.
   The snow was heaviest in the northern Black Hills of
northeastern Wyoming. By Wednesday afternoon, snow had fallen there
for a day and a half, and totals by Wednesday morning ranged up to
14 inches at Sundance and Moorcroft.
   Strong northerly wind produced snow squalls over parts of the
upper Great Lakes, with heavy snow reported in Wisconsin. The town
of Kenauwee in eastern Wisconsin fot 5 inches of snow in four hours
during the morning and up to a foot of snow was possible by
Thursday elsewhere in Kewaunee and Door county.
   Low pressure off the coast of North Carolina spread more light
snow over parts of North Carolina and the middle Atlantic Coast.
   Snowfall totals in Virginia ranged up to 10.5 inches at Powhatan
by midday, with 10 inches at Fluvana, Albemarle and Franklin, the
National Weather Service said. Totals in Delaware ranged up to 5
inches at Newcastle, and in New Jersey the storm produced 6.4
inches of snow at Estelle Manor.
   Up to 13 inches of snow covered parts of southern Maryland,
forcing the closings of 28 school districts in Maryland and
Delaware.

<HEAD>Mass Grave of Children Discovered in Northern Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials on Wednesday announced the discovery
of a mass grave with the remains of 135 children of North African
Jewish immigrants who died in a 1957 epidemic, Israel television
reported.
   The report came after a day of prayers and accusations by other
Jews from Yemen on the Saudi Arabian peninsula. They feared the
grave could hold the bones of about 600 children from their
community that were reported missing in the 1950s shortly after
their arrival in Israel.
   The discovery of the mass grave reopened one of the most
mysterious chapters in the history of immigration to the Jewish
state. There has never been an authoritative explanation of the
disappearance of the Yemenite children.
   One theory is that they were taken to collective farms and lost
contact with their parents. Another is they were dispersed to other
immigrant camps.
   However, news reports said the remains in the mass grave were
instead those of North African children who died during the
epidemic.
   The unmarked mass grave was discovered last week in a cemetery
in Kfar Yona, a village 20 miles north of Tel Aviv, when
gravediggers tried to dig in an unused portion of the cemetery.
   The find was leaked to the press by a gravedigger who said he
feared the children's remains might not be treated properly, Israel
TV reported.
   Dozens of Yemenite families flocked to the gravesite Wednesday
shortly after its discovery was announced on Israel radio.
   Almost 47,000 Yemenites, nearly the entire Jewish community,
were brought to Israel as part of ``Operation Magic Carpet.'' That
program ended in 1950.
   Yisrael Kessar, a legislator from the left-of-center Labor Party
and a Yemenite immigrant, called on Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
to order an investigation into the discovery after it was announced.
   However, police investigators said the remains were of children
of North African immigrants who died in a nearby hospital and were
hastily buried in a mass grave without a marker for ``economic
reasons,'' Israel radio reported.
   Most of the North Africans were from Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and
Algeria. There was no report of what sickness killed them, but
various epidemics swept through Israeli camps in those years,
including cholera and tuberculosis.
   The mass grave is next to the sites of two such camps.
   Nissim Atiya, a gravedigger who buried the victims in 1957, said
the children's families were notified of their deaths, and ``it was
all done officially.''

   The deluge of indignities continued for Erich
Honecker, the disgraced former Communist Party chief, when the East
Berlin city government decided Wednesday to take back his honorary
citizenship.
   The official news agency ADN said the City Council voted
unanimously, on grounds Honecker had misused his office, to relieve
him of the honor bestowed in 1982, when his power was unquestioned.
   Honecker has been under house arrest at an exclusive compound
outside East Berlin since Dec. 5 and is the object of a corruption
investigation. He was forced out as party chief Oct. 18, then lost
the presidency, all his other important jobs and his party
membership.
   A West German tourist agency said Honecker's vacation retreat on
the Schwerin Lake would be open to tourists in March. The Hansa
agency of Hamburg said in a news release Wednesday the two-house
complex 120 miles north of East Berlin could accommodate 45 to 55
beds.
   Among its features will be two small restaurants, a wine and
beer bar, a small bathing area with rowboats and bicycles.
   Hansa and the East German government travel agency, will run the
operation together, with 50 percent of the rooms reserved for West
German tourists and the remainder for East Germans, the news
release said.

   Democratic House members continued their
attack on President Bush's decision to send high-level officials to
confer with Chinese leaders, complaining Wednesday that the White
House refused to allow one of those officials to come to Capitol
Hill to defend the action.
   ``It seems the Bush administration is willing to send Mr.
Eagleburger 6,000 miles to apologize to the Chinese leaders, but it
was not willing to send him two miles to Capitol Hill to explain
this action to Congress,'' said Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger had been invited
to testify about the trip before a hearing convened by two House
Foreign Affairs subcommittees. Eagleburger made the surprise visit
to Beijing last weekend with National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft.
   The State Department said Eagleburger could not testify because
he was filling in for Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who is
in Europe. However, spokesman Richard Boucher said Eagleburger had
briefed several members of Congress on the mission.
   Democrats vowed to press early next year for punitive sanctions
against the Chinese government in retaliation for its violent
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing last June,
saying they could prevail even if Bush vetoes the bill.
   Gejdenson was harshly critical of the Eagleburger-Scowcroft
visit, contending they apologized ``for being offended by the
savage squelching of those who courageously sought basic freedoms
in Tiananmen Square.''
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, defended Bush.
   ``I don't know of a soul who believes that the Scowcroft mission
went to Beijing to apologize to the Chinese,'' he said. ``This
Congress and this administration have no intention of kowtowing to
illegitimate Chinese actions.''
   However, Leach said he believes the United States has an
obligation to take whatever steps it can to persude the Chinese
lift the ``yoke of political oppression'' The weekend mission, he
said, can be seen as a test of the ability of outside parties to
``help extricate a proud nation from an embarassing corner.''
   ``President Bush is prudentially betting that a historically
xenophobic China is more likely to temper its stridency at home and
abroad if it isn't perceived to be capitulating to the pressure of
foreign powers,'' Leach said.
   As House members wrangled over the issue, Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, weighed in on behalf of those who contend
Bush made a serious blunder in sending Scowcroft and Eagleburger to
Beijing.
   Mitchell, in a speech before the Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco, said Bush compounded his blunder when he moved to lift
sanctions he had imposed against China by executive order.
   Those moves, Mitchell said, include renewing subsidies for wheat
sales to China, permitting Chinese engineers to return to the
United States to work on upgrading Chinese fighter planes and a
possible lifting of a ban on exporting communications satellites.
   ``These actions represent an embarrassing eagerness to please
the Chinese government and an awkward reluctance to support the
aspirations of the Chinese people,'' Mitchell said. ``It should be
the other way around.''

   First lady Barbara Bush sang Christmas carols
and passed out shopping bags filled with gifts Wednesday to poor
children at a mission serving low-income and needy families.
   She was a surprise guest when she showed up for a mid-morning
party at the Central Union Mission, greeting more than 100 children
and their mothers and reading a story about the birth of Jesus.
   Robert Rich, the mission's director, said many of the children
were ``borderline homeless,'' living with friends and relatives but
not in their own homes.
   Workers at federal agencies, as well as friends and sponsors of
the mission, contributed about 500 bags of toys for the children.
The bags are being distributed at three Christmas parties.

   Nine women who bared their breasts on a
city beach last summer were not covered by the Constitution, a
judge ruled Wednesday.
   Rochester City Court Judge John Manning Regan refused to dismiss
the charges, saying the women violated a state law that prohibits
public breast exposure. He also found them guilty and fined them.
   Defense attorneys argued during a trial this fall that the law
is ``a badge of inequality'' and a violation of the 14th Amendment,
which guarantees equal protection under the law.
   They asked Regan to declare the law unconstitutional and he gave
them time to present written arguments before making his ruling.
   The prosecutor argued that the law is constitutional and
conforms to community standards.
   The women were arrested in June for removing their tops on a
Rochester beach. Charges were dropped against a 10th because she
was nursing her child, which is exempt from the state law. Exposure
carries a maximum penalty of 15 days in jail and a $250 fine.
   ``It was very disappointing to have his ruling against us. I see
it as a crushing blow against equal rights for women,'' said
defendant Mary Lou Schloss.
   Seven women _ then known as the Topfree Seven _ were charged
with indecent exposure in 1986 after they removed their shirts in
Rochester's Cobbs Hill Park. Those charges were dismissed by a
judge who called it an issue of free speech.
   Three women who were arrested in both cases were given $100
fines Wednesday: Schloss, 41; Kathleen Reilly, 43; and Ramona
Santorelli, 31, all of Rochester.
   Six other defendants were either fined $50 or ordered to do
community service: Gail Nieser, 25; Sarah Wells, 41; Susan David,
35; and Nina Leibowitz, 21, all of Rochester, along with Lyn Gallo,
29, of Ithaca and Marilyn Hiller, 61, of Brevard, N.C.
   The women were also given criminal discharges, meaning another
arrest for a defendant within a year could reopen the charges
against her.
   Regan dismissed charges against Tierney O'Brien-Dovan, 31, who
was nursing her child.
   During sentencing, some of the women said they would continue to
go shirtless.

   China has approved a new Voice of America
correspondent to replace the newsman expelled after the government
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, the State Department
announced Wednesday.
   The foreign ministry conveyed its approval to the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing three days after a high-level U.S. delegation returned
from a surprise trip to China.
   The delegation discussed ways to mend the strained ties between
the two governments that have existed since hundreds of people were
killed in June when the Chinese military advanced on the
demonstrators in Tianamen Square.
   ``We welcome'' the decision to approve Stephanie Mann Nealer's
accreditation, which has been pending since September, the State
Department said in a statement. Nealer is head of the VOA's East
Asia and Pacific News department.
   VOA correspondent Al Pessin and Associated Press newsman John
Pomfret were expelled from China after being accused of spreading
rumors and lies about the military crackdown.
   VOA Director Richard W. Carlson said he didn't know whether the
Chinese decision on VOA was related to the weekend talks in Beijing
led by National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   ``We think this is a positive step,'' Carlson said.
   The next move, Carlson said, is for China to stop jamming the
Mandarin and Cantonese language VOA broadcasts to China, as they
have since June. The four-hour English-language broadcasts are not
jammed, he said.
   The Bush administration, criticized by some members of Congress
for the recent overtures to Beijing while Chinese authorities
continue to harshly suppress pro-democracy dissidents, has made
clear it would welcome any reciprocal gesture from China.
   The first such gesture came when China's official news agency
announced Monday, the day Scowcroft returned, that China would not
sell Syria medium-range M-9 missiles that have been a subject of
U.S. concern.
   After Scowcroft returned, the administration revealed it was
considering lifting a ban on satellite exports to China. Bush
refused Wednesday to reply when asked if he was prepared to lift
the ban, but a spokesman said there had not been a final decision.
   The Hughes Aircraft-manufactured communications satellites fall
in the category of items on the government's sensitive munitions
list that were automatically included in a suspension of U.S.
exports to China imposed to protest the crackdown.
   On Capitol Hill, a source said the satellite deal would be
approved Friday. The source, who has been following the
administration's deliberations, spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell called word of the
concessions to China an indication of ``an embarrassing eagerness
to please the Chinese government and an awkward reluctance to
support the aspirations of the Chinese people. It should be the
other way around.''
   Mitchell noted that Bush said after the June crackdown that
there could not be business as usual with any government that would
take such action.
   ``Yet that is exactly what appears to be happening,'' Mitchell
said in a speech to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco.
   On the House side, members of the Asia subcommittee harshly
criticized the trip to Beijing and lambasted Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger for declining to appear before the panel
to report on his talks in Beijing.
   Meanwhile, it was revealed that a third administration official,
White House personnel director Chase Untermeyer, joined Scowcroft
and Eagleburger on the China trip to make personal contacts for the
president.
   White House spokesman Steve Hart said Untermeyer's main mission
was to speak to two Chinese friends of Bush, one a mid-level
government official and the other a former member of government.
   Untermeyer, Hart said, was ``simply to hear their thoughts about
the changes going on in China'' since the June demonstrations.
   Bush served as liaison officer, then the highest-ranking U.S.
representative in Beijing, in 1974-75.

<HEAD>USAir Strips Old DC-9s to Look for Wear</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir is taking apart three of its older
planes to search for age-related structural flaws in an
around-the-clock effort to get a head start on an expected
tightening of aircraft safety standards.
   ``We're trying to look in places you normally can't look at to
see what we can do to prevent a problem in the future,'' said USAir
spokesman John Bronson.
   A task force comprising representatives of the Federal Aviation
Administration, airlines and aircraft manufacturers began studying
the safety of older planes last year in the wake of several
age-related accidents. It began its work in October 1988, six
months after a section of the fuselage of an Aloha Airlines jet
peeled off over the Pacific Ocean.
   Jack Naughton, director of aircraft heavy maintenance for USAir,
said Wednesday that FAA inspection recommendations are likely to
become mandatory in February. Naughton called the Aloha Airlines
accident, which killed a flight attendant and injured dozens of
passengers, the catalyst for the closer look at older planes.
   USAir selected three DC-9s, each about 20 years old, for the
program. The airline has completed what it calls an inch-by-inch
inspection of one DC-9 and returned it to the USAir 400-plane fleet.
   The second plane in the program is at an airline maintenance
hangar at Pittsburgh's airport. Mechanics are to have it finished
within a month.
   The 22-year-old DC-9, built for Delta Airlines in 1967 and
bought by USAir a decade later, has been stripped of its paint and
cabin furnishings. Three shifts of 18 mechanics each work day and
night, searching for flaws not readily revealed by more common
inspection techniques.
   The thick smell of primer floats inside the hangar and there is
a constant whir of machinery and ping of hammers on rivets.
   Mostly, the mechanics are looking for evidence of corrosion,
which airline officials believe leads to fuselage cracks.
   Standing over a table beside the 107-foot-long plane, mechanic
Harry Garman worked Wednesday to replace corroded metal from
underneath the aircraft.
   ``We'll either treat it or we'll replace it, depending on the
depth of it,'' Garman said.
   ``It's kind of like your rusty fender on a car,'' he explained.
``If it's just a little bit of rust, you clean it up and paint it,
but if it's real deep, you replace that area.''
   Working on a scaffold alongside the plane, Charlie Slack placed
a metal reinforcing strip above the plane's windows from front to
rear. Tests have shown that area to be more susceptible to stress
cracks than other parts of the plane.
   USAir estimates the procedure will cost about $1 million per
plane. After the first three DC-9s are completed, airline officials
will review the program and make any necessary adjustments before
continuing.
   George Mason, the airline's vice president of heavy maintenance,
said 29 planes are scheduled to be completed in the next four
years. A total of 50 of USAir's 74 DC-9s will be stripped and
inspected, he said.
   Mason said he's not worried that patching up the aircraft might
make USAir's fleet look less sky-worthy.
   ``It all in your perspective,'' he said. ``When you see an
airplane at the gate that has patches on it, should you be
concerned _ or should you be concerned if you see an airplane that
doesn't have them?''

   On July 18, 1863, despite fatigue and poor rations, the 54th
Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Infantry marched across a half-mile
of sand on a South Carolina beach to lead the ill-planned attack on
Fort Wagner in Charleston harbor. The regiment lost more than 40
percent of its men.
   The story of the 54th, the first black regiment from the North
to fight in the Civil War, and its youthful white colonel, Robert
Gould Shaw, unfolds in ``Glory,'' Edward Zwick's masterful movie
for Tri-Star Pictures.
   Zwick presents a powerful, moving tapestry of war's
senselessness. The screenplay by Kevin Jarre is partly based on the
books ``Lay This Laurel'' and ``One Gallant Rush,'' and letters
Shaw wrote home to his parents. The movie _ narrated by Matthew
Broderick as Shaw _ is largely seen through his eyes.
   Young and privileged, but disillusioned and battle-scarred after
the gory and indecisive Battle of Antietam, Shaw returns to his
wealthy, powerful and abolitionist parents in Massachusetts just in
time for a lavish party and an offer from the governor to take
command of an all-black fighting regiment.
   He rises in rank from captain to colonel and musters his men,
who include his childhood friends Cabot (Cary Elwes), who is white
and becomes a major, and Tom (Andre Braugher), a second-generation
free black who volunteers as an enlisted man.
   Much of ``Glory'' focuses on the basic training of a ragtag
group of runaway slaves and free men, who are denied all the basic
supplies given to white soldiers, including proper shoes and the
coveted blue uniform, and are asked to accept less pay.
   They have much to learn about soldiering and about human
relations, in a fight for freedom and the restoration of the union.
   As Trip, an embittered runaway, Denzel Washington (``Cry
Freedom,'' ``The Mighty Quinn,'' ``Power'') does a star turn. His
hatred, desires, feelings are worn on his face, such as when he's
flogged for supposedly trying to desert. Not one word is uttered;
he merely locks eyes with Broderick (``Biloxi Blues,'' ``War
Games'') and allows a single tear to fall. Broderick, meanwhile,
shows clear repulsion and sorrow. Why? Because the whip _ a symbol
of the servitude from which the men had fled _ had been used on
Trip in the past: His back is a jungle of ugly scars.
   ``Glory'' becomes Trip's story _ as well as Shaw's _ as the
runaway undergoes a radical self-realization. In the end, the 54th
becomes the only family he's ever known.
   Zwick, the Emmy-award winning director of ``Special Bulletin''
and ``thirtysomething,'' stresses visual acting in ``Glory.''
Action speaks louder than words, and he focuses on facial
expressions and body movements rather than histrionics, gimmicks or
slick words.
   He also is spare with dialogue. When the 54th marches past the
white regiments _ who regarded the blacks as a joke and less than
men _ to lead the assault against Fort Wagner, only four words are
spoken by the once hostile whites: ``Give 'em hell, 54.''
   Ultimately, color no longer is the issue. The men are fellow
soldiers about to die. And like ``Gallipoli'' and ``Hamburger
Hill,'' the overriding issue becomes the utter futility of war.
   The battle scene at Fort Wagner is beautifully choreographed,
the men running along the beach, the U.S. flag full and billowing.
It is poetic and yet powerful.
   ``Glory'' makes good use of battle scenes. They are exciting,
frightening and realistic. At James Island, the 54th gets its first
taste of fighting. After firing a few rounds and watching a
Confederate unit retreat, more Confederates appear through the mist
like gray ghosts and the battle soon becomes hand-to-hand combat.
Dan Lerner was second unit director, and Bob Minor coordinated the
stunts.
   ``Glory'' is bound to be a contender at Oscar time. It also has
a haunting but overused score by James Horner, with choral work by
the Boys Choir of Harlem. The music is lovely but unfortunately the
filmmakers use the same refrain so often that just about every
scene becomes a climax.
   There are good performances by Morgan Freeman (``Street Smart,''
``Driving Miss Daisy''), Jihmi Kennedy as a stuttering enlisted man
and John Finn as the fierce no-nonsense Irish sergeant-major who
whips the 54th into shape. Braugher, whose theater credits include
``Much Ado About Nothing'' and ``King John'' at the New York
Shakespeare Festival, makes his film debut in ``Glory,'' and is
someone to watch. Jane Alexander appears as Shaw's mother.
   The Freddie Fields production has a running time of 122 minutes
and is rated R.

<HEAD>Mercenary Says President was Accidentally Slain by Bodyguard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French mercenary widely
blamed for killing the leader of the Comoros Islands said the
president was accidentally shot by his own bodyguard during an army
attack, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Meanwhile a French news agency said French and South African
officials met with the mercenary, Bob Denard, on Wednesday in an
attempt to persuade him to leave the remote islands off southeast
Africa.
   Denard, who heads the mercenary-led Presidential Guard on the
islands, said President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane was fatally
shot on Nov. 26 during an assault by army troops, The Star
newspaper reported from the Comoros capital of Moroni.
   The report did not say why the army was attacking the nation's
leader.
   Denard, in a statement read to journalists Tuesday night, said
he was in the room with Abdallah at the presidential palace when
the shooting occurred. But he again denied any responsibility for
the killing, The Star reported.
   The mercenary, a veteran soldier of fortune who has fought in
Africa and Asia, declined to answer questions or elaborate on the
circumstances of Abdallah's death other than to say a bodyguard
actually shot the president.
   Denard and 30 other French and Belgian mercenaries use the
Presidential Guard to control the islands despite widespread
opposition by residents, who have taken to the streets in protest.
   The mercenary said he was prepared to leave the islands if he is
allowed to go ``with honor.'' He is negotiating with the French and
South Africans, the largest aid donors to the Comoros, and wants
financial compensation in exchange for leaving.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse, in a report from
Moroni, quoted unidentified sources as saying French and South
African officials met with Denard for 20 minutes Wednesday morning.
   There was no information on what was discussed, but the agency
said a sticking point is Denard's demand for a guarantee he will
not be prosecuted in France for his role in an unsuccessful 1977
coup in the West African country of Benin.
   Comorans widely blame Denard for Abdallah's death. According to
various sources, the two men argued about several matters just
before the shooting.
   Denard helped engineer a coup that ousted Abdallah in 1975, the
year the island nation became independent from France.
   Denard then led a 1978 coup that restored Abdallah to power. He
and his fellow mercenaries have remained a leading force on the
islands ever since.
   In Paris, President Francois Mitterrand said at Wednesday's
weekly Cabinet meeting that ``any idea of French military
intervention is excluded'' in the Comoros, government spokesman
Louis Le Pensec told reporters.

   Chileans elect a new government Thursday,
returning to a democratic tradition that was a model for Latin
America until Gen. Augusto Pinochet seized power in 1973. The
opposition is expected to win.
   Of 7.5 million registered voters, 3.5 million have never voted
in a real election. Voting is mandatory and failure to vote can
bring a $95 fine.
   Most pre-election polls gave Patricio Aylwin, who represents an
alliance of 17 centrist and leftist parties, a lead of more than 20
percentage points over pro-government candidate Hernan Buchi.
   A third candidate, 47-year-old conservative entrepreneur
Francisco Errazuriz, is expected to finish far back.
   The opposition alliance led the effort that defeated Pinochet in
an October 1988 referendum by rejecting a proposal that he continue
as president until 1997. That forced him to call elections.
   Although he will be out as president, Pinochet says he will
remain as army commander for eight more years, sheltered by a
constitutional provision that prohibits the new president from
dismissing him. The opposition has urged him to retire, but
acknowledges it is the general's decision.
   A violent coup led by Pinochet in September 1973 overthrew the
3-year-old elected government of the late President Salvador
Allende, an avowed Marxist, during a period of political and
economic disorder.
   Interior Minister Carlos Caceres told foreign reporters the
election was ``the culmination of a orderly, staged process'' that
started the day of the coup. He said the military government ``had
kept its word'' to restore democracy once it established order,
rightened the economy and created a new legal framework for
government.
   Upon taking power, Pinochet had promised to rule ``only as long
as circumstances demand.''
   In preparation for the Thursday's vote, municipal workers
stripped campaign posters from walls and telephone poles, and
painted out political graffiti that blossomed in a generally
peaceful campaign. Campaigning ended Monday night by law.
   Soldiers and police guarded polling places, along with strategic
sites in the cities and countryside.
   Pinochet made no public statements, but Gen. Jorge Lucar, the
deputy army commander, asked Chileans to ``go and vote peacefully,
knowing they can count on all guarantees necessary to cast their
ballots freely and secretly.''
   Aylwin's campaign manager, Enrique Silva Cimma, met Wednesday
with Gen. Carlos Parera, commander of the Santiago garrison, and
said Parera gave assurances the armed forces would guarantee a
clean vote.
   Another coalition official, Enrique Krauss, asked the government
to report voting results ``in strict accordance with the law.''
   In the 1988 referendum, widespread allegations arose that
negative results were held back for hours before the government
admitted Pinochet had lost.
   Caceres said initial results would be reported after the first
350,000 votes, about 5 percent of the total, were counted Thursday
night and updated reports would follow every 90 minutes or so.
   Caceres said final results for the 38 Senate seats and the 120
in the House of Deputies would be known about noon Friday.
   Cardinal Juan Francisco Fresno of Santiago said Wednesday: ``I
believe we can now say in all truth that spirits have calmed and we
can be confident of a new dawn in peace and fraternal friendship.''
   The church was one of Pinochet's few outspoken critics during
years of anti-leftist repression that followed the coup. It
condemned violations of human rights, including the disappearances
of hundreds of dissidents and the torture and expulsion of
thousands more.
   Aylwin, 71, is a moderate Christian Democrat, active in politics
for four decades and known for a low-key, conciliatory style. He
has stressed the need to avoid confrontation and seek national
reconciliation.
   Buchi, 40, is an internationally respected technocrat who joined
Pinochet's economic team in 1975 and was finance minister from 1985
until May, a period of steady economic growth and low inflation.
His advisers hope to keep Aylwin's vote total below a majority in
the three-way race and force a runoff.

   Town officials, fearing that beaver dams
would flood recently repaired Linseed Road, decided to rub out the
rodents but found themselves having to take on schoolchildren and
The Beaver's Club.
   Pupils at Breor Elementary School in this small town about 20
miles north of Springfield fired off a batch of letters last week
accusing selectmen of being cruel and asking, ``please don't kill
the beavers.''
   About six beavers live in a marshy field next to the road,
according to Micki Seigel, who lives in the area and has printed up
bumper stickers saying, ``I love the Linseed Road beavers.''
   This week, a pupil's letter reached The Beavers' Club of Hampden
and Hampshire Counties, a Holyoke-based service group, asking them
to help their namesakes.
   Selectman Chairman George Zgrodnick Jr. said Wednesday he
remains convinced that trapping is the best solution to protect the
$350,000 worth of repairs on the road.
   ``I don't know much about beaver dams, but I know they're bad,''
Zgrodnick said.
   He defended his decision not to call in an engineer before
authorizing the trapping, but said an engineer would be called in
this weekend to assess the potential for damage.
   Zgrodnick said selectmen told people opposing trapping that if
they could find another way to deal with the problem ``very, very
quickly, go ahead.''
   Beaver Club President Charles Davignon said his group was not
interested in joining the political fray, but was willing to
consider a request for help if a compromise is agreed on, such as
installing special drainage pipes.
   Club members visited Seigel this week at Running Gutter brook. A
small beaver lodge and dam have turned the field by the road into a
shallow pond now covered with ice.
   Seigel said her main objective was to buy time until the field
froze over.
   ``I am not an animal rights activist,'' she said. ``It just
seemed, why kill them if you don't have to.''
   The beavers appeared this summer and the issue of the road
threat surfaced this fall, said Zgrodnik, who said he did not
recall who first brought it up.
   Some in town said they weren't sure how the issue got so
controversial.
   ``We were kind of caught surprised ourselves when we started
reading in the newspapers and we started checking into it,'' said
Water Commissioner Robert Osepowicz.
   Even if beaver dams block storm drains, water will drain through
slits cut into the curb, Highway Superintendent Marshall Pease was
quoted as saying in a local newspaper last week.
   Pease had no comment Wednesday. ``All the answers come from town
hall,'' he said.
   Tom Decker, a biologist with the state Division of Fisheries and
Wildlife, said about 1,400 beavers are killed in Massachusetts each
year during the season between Nov. 15 and Feb. 28.
   ``We get hundreds of nuisance complaints,'' Decker said.

   The Soviet Union has paid Belgium
$685,000 in damages caused by the crash of a Soviet MiG-23 fighter
plane, the government said Wednesday.
   The July 4 crash ended Europe's longest pilotless flight ever
recorded. The Soviet pilot, who had been participating in
exercises, bailed out over northwestern Poland after a mechanical
malfunction.
   He said he steered the plane toward the Baltic Sea but the plane
flew West over East Germany, West Germany and Holland before it ran
out of fuel and crashed in a western Belgian village, destroying a
house and killing an 18-year-old boy sleeping there.
   Soviet authorities immediately apologized and sent officials to
Belgium to investigate and estimate damages.
   The Belgian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that with the Soviet
payment, ``The case is closed.''

   In a decision Solomon might admire, a judge
Wednesday authorized Mrs. Santa Claus to share equal gift-giving
Christmas rights with her famous husband, and declared their sleigh
``community property.''
   Furthermore, Mrs. Claus' title is now ``Ms.,'' and she is
``emancipated from any household duties'' so that she may accompany
her jolly spouse on his airborne tours of the world, according to
the ruling by Municipal Court Judge George T. Choppelas.
   Christmas generosity symbolized by Santa Claus is a ``universal
phenomenon'' and should have no gender strings attached, the judge
added, undoubtedly with an eye to his political future.
   A courtroom jammed with spectators, reporters and photographers
broke into cheers and applause at the conclusion of a rather unruly
and holiday-happy 60th session of San Francisco's mock Court of
Historical Review.
   The just-for-fun court is a 14-year San Francisco tradition
staged in a real City Hall courtroom, with a real judge, real
lawyers, clerks and stenographers. Only the witnesses are phony.
   Everybody has a good time with such questions as who invented
the martini, is chicken soup Jewish penicillin, and where did chop
suey come from.
   ``Thank you for not starting without me,'' said the judge to the
trial advocates, San Francisco Supervisor Angela Alioto, who said
Santa was a woman, and Public Defender Jeff Brown, who said he must
remain a male. Brown, who will run for re-election, let his
witnesses carry the case.
   The stage was set by a reading of Clement Moore's ``A Visit From
St. Nicholas,'' by a local talk show personality.
   Looking on with interest were Municipal Court Judge Diane Wick,
dressed as a female Santa, and lawyer Robert J. McCarthy,
pillow-paunched with a tatty white beard and wig. He sat on the
lady Santa's lap.
   ``It's obvious that Santa Claus is a woman,'' claimed Alioto,
insisting that the Italian female Santa Claus, ``Befana,'' leaps
down chimneys to dole out toys to good kids, and chunks of coal to
the bad ones.
   The lady Santa testified hotly that the idea of a male Santa
Claus ``is a fraud and a hoax,'' furthered by the male chauvinist
persuasion.
   Completing her testimony, Santa laid several brightly wrapped
gifts before the judge.
   ``Bribery!'' hollered the male Santa.
   Tradition requires that Santa Claus remain a man, testified San
Francisco City College history professor Lee Dolson, who wondered
whether Alioto was arguing that the Italian Santa might have
resulted from a sex change operation.
   ``I think that Santa Claus is the personification of Christmas,
and Santa Claus as a man ... (he) embodies the spirit of Christmas,
which is giving, caring and hope,'' testified psychiatric hospital
adminstrator Franco Diamond. ``The thought of Santa Claus as a
woman _ I shudder ...''
   Nobody in the courtrroom shared the shudder, and the judge ruled
that everybody wins.

<TEXT>
   Talk of reunification raises the specter of a
``Fourth Reich,'' Communists said Wednesday, but West German plans
for hundreds of millions of dollars in aid are the latest sign the
two countries are coming together.
   A Munich newspaper quoted Willy Brandt, the former West German
chancellor, as saying the Soviets prevented a potential bloodbath
in Leipzig on Oct. 9, when protest against the old hard-line
leadership of East Germany reached its peak.
   Manfred Gerlach, interim president of East Germany, told church
leaders a new constitution expected next year would provide for
individual states within a federal system, another sign of the
Communists' continuing loss of power.
   Indignities continued for Erich Honecker, the disgraced former
Communist Party chief deposed Oct. 18. The East Berlin City Council
took back the honorary citizenship bestowed on him in 1982.
   In West Germany, the ultra-right Republican Party said it would
try to organize an East German sister party to enter candidates in
free parliamentary elections planned for May.
   About 1,000 high school students, teachers and parents
demonstrated in East Berlin against mandatory instruction in the
Russian language.
   Several thousand students and parents in the northern city of
Stralsund demanded that teachers who belong to the Communist Party
be fired, and 2,000 people in Schwerin demonstrated against German
reunification, the official news agency ADN reported.
   For several weeks, at least a half-dozen new projects involving
the two Germanys have been announced every day, many initiated by
West Germans. The East German government has acknowledged the
``German question,'' but has publicly insisted no formal union will
occur.
   On Wednesday, the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland
said East Germany must adhere to ``socialist, anti-fascist,
pacifist and all international leftist traditions, especially those
of Lenin.''
   It said a West German ``pocketing'' of East Germany was not on
the agenda, and rejected ``a Fourth Reich, however that would be
formed'' _ a reference to Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   Other newspapers took a similar line against reunificiation,
including Neue Zeit, published by the Christian Democrats, who
recently broke with the Communist Party.
   Neue Zeit said demonstrators in Leipzig who called for
reunification were expressing outdated ``megalomaniac dreams of
Greater Germany.''
   New Forum, which has 200,000 members and is the largest
opposition group, officially opposes reunification, but increasing
calls for one German state at its Monday night rallies in Leipzig
have threatened to split the movement.
   In an interview with East German television, President Richard
von Weizsaecker cautioned against attempts to speed reunification
and against ``heating up'' the already volatile political situation
in East Germany.
   The Soviet Union opposes reunification and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III has urged a cautious approach, but signs of a
virtual de facto union grow daily.
   On Wednesday, West Germany said it was providing $540 million to
East Germany for 17 environmental cleanup projects. East Germany
has one of the most polluted environments and some of the most
fouled rivers in Europe, and experts say help is needed urgently to
prevent an ecological catastrophe.
   Mayor Walter Momper of West Berlin and his East Berlin
counterpart, Erhard Krack, announced agreements Wednesday ranging
from joint subway tickets to Western investment in East Berlin.
   Economics Minister Christa Luft of East Germany said she expects
Parliament to pass a law on joint ventures within three months.
West German businesses have been preparing for huge investments.
   West Germans have seized most of the initiative to date,
prompting East German warnings against a wholesale national sellout
to the rich, capitalist nation.
   East German cities also have appealed to West German sister
cities for aid, however. West German cities have sent food,
medicine, heaters and even scaffolding, municipal officials said at
a conference in Cologne.
   On Thursday, Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann of West Germany
is to meet with Premier Hans Modrow, bringing a three-point
economic aid plan with him.

   State officials vowed they would fare better
on their next visit to a potential radioactive waste dump site
after they were chased and cornered for five hours Wednesday by
anti-dump protesters.
   More than 100 dump opponents scored a moral, if not
psychological victory, when they demanded police arrest them, or
the members of a scouting team from the state Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Siting Commission, for trespassing.
   The commission's field teams were on a walking tour of the
proposed site in the town of Allen when they were spotted around
noon by more than 100 dump opponents, according to protest
organizer Stuart Campbell.
   The protesters tracked footprints left by the seven state
officials as they ran up and down hills in the wooded area before
catching them on a county road and surrounding them with a human
chain, said Allegany County Sheriff Lawrence Scholes.
   The officials were released some five hours later after the
owner of the land they were surveying filed a trespassing complaint
against them.
   Meanwhile, 100 miles to the east, 20 protesters were arrested in
Cortland County for disorderly conduct after they refused to allow
a state inspection team to leave one of two potential sites there,
according to a sheriff's department dispatcher.
   In Allen, Scholes said the protesters ignored warnings to stay
away from the proposed site and camped out there overnight.
   The dump opponents said the state officials were on private
property and the owner was never told the team would be there to
inspect his land.
   ``Either you arrest them or you arrest us,'' Sally Campbell of
the Allegany County Nonviolent Action Group told the officers.
   William Giovanniello, the owner of the property, said state
officials did not have his permission to be on his land. ``They
never notified me _ no phone call, no nothing,'' he said.
   Siting commission staff member Bruce Goodale called
Giovanniello's claim ``sheer nonsense.''
   After Giovanniello filed a written complaint against the state,
the dump opponents allowed the officials to leave.
   As they did, the group howled and yelled, ``See you in the
morning.'' Protesters vowed they would again block commission
members from inspecting the other two possible dump sites in the
county.
   Goodale promised his group would return.
   ``They may feel it is,'' a moral or psychological victory, said
Jay Dunkleberger, executive director of the commission, who visited
the Cortland County site Wednesday. ``I consider it a draw. We did
accomplish the task we set for ourselves for the day.''
   Commission officials in the Cortland County town of Taylor had
to be escorted two miles after protesters there formed a human
chain and pinned them in their cars.
   The anti-dump group sent cars, trucks and tractors to the site
Wednesday morning after members who have been watching the two
Taylor sites around the clock reported the state field crew's
arrival, said Taffy Rook, a spokeswoman for Citizens Against
Radioactive Dumping.
   At one point, three state officials and several deputies were
``trapped'' in the woods by protesters who had blocked all roads
leading to the site, Rook said.
   Mary Gardner Smith, a spokeswoman for Concerned Citizens of
Allegany County, said about 20 protesters camped out overnight in
freezing temperatures at two of the three Allegany sites to block
state officials from beginning inspections on land there. They were
joined by other protesters at daybreak, she said.
   Siting Commission officials said they hoped to start testing
possible sites after the deer hunting season ended Tuesday.
   ``I hope that people don't go outside the law,'' said Susan
Baranski, a spokeswoman for the commission. ``The courts have made
it clear that the commission has the right and responsibility to do
this.''
   Anti-dump groups in Allegany and Cortland counties have promised
to prevent the testing from taking place. The groups said their
protests would be nonviolent but said they expected arrests.
   The five possible sites were chosen by the commission in
September. Under federal law, states must have a place to store
low-level radioactive waste by 1993.
   The commission plans to complete soil testing and other
evaluations by spring. The commission will then narrow down the
number of sites to two or three for more comprehensive tests.

<HEAD>School Program Launched to Reduce Gun Violence Among Youths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first comprehensive program to teach
kindergartners and high schoolers alike about the dangers of guns
was launched Wednesday by Dade County's public schools.
   The special curriculum was developed following a record 43
gunshot deaths last year in Dade County of children 18 and under;
so far this year, at least 48 children have been killed in
gun-related incidents in Dade, school officials said.
   The program was made necessary by an increase in the prevalence
of guns in society, said Michael Krop, a member of the Dade County
School Board.
   ``We now feel compelled, unfortunately, to teach kids about
guns,'' Krop said earlier at a news conference at Coconut Grove
Elementary. ``Essentially our message to young people is, `You
don't touch a handgun.'''
   That message will be reinforced in the classroom with
discussions aimed at helping students recognize unsafe situations
and know how to react when encountering guns.
   A video also will be shown to middle and senior high students
focusing on the trauma of a gunshot death or injury _ through the
experiences of other kids. One teen-ager describes the trauma of
accidentally shooting his father; also interviewed were a football
player left paralyzed and a girl who lost a leg in gun attacks.
   Brochures and a video were being prepared for parents to help
them insure the safety of their children.
   Wednesday was declared ``Gun Safety Awareness Day'' by Dade
County Public Schools, the nation's fourth-largest school district.
   ``Today's youngsters are at a greater risk of gun violence than
any previous generation,'' Barbara Lautman, executive director of
the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence in Washignton, D.C., said
Friday at the news conference. ``We want the Dade County program to
serve as the national standard for education to reduce gun
violence, death and injury among youth.''
   In 1987, one out of every 10 children who died in the nation was
killed with a gun, and gun accidents were the fourth leading cause
of accidental death for children, according to Ms. Lautman.
   A new state law aimed at protecting children from accidental
shootings also authorized the development of a gun-safety program
in public schools. The measure, which took effect in October,
requires gun owners to take reasonable precautions to keep loaded
weapons away from children 15 and younger; the law provides for
jail time and fines for gun owner's carelessness.
   Dade's program to prevent gun injuries and deaths among children
is tailored by age groups. For example, at the elementary level the
emphasis will be on role-playing, while in the sixth through 12th
grades, students will focus on issues surrounding gun violence,
including conflict resolution activities and the role of the media.
   The curriculum was developed following discussions in April led
by volunteers from the Dade County Youth Crime Watch with some 400
middle and senior high students about guns and gun violence.
   Among the findings, released Wednesday, were that students have
mixed opinions on whether guns are good or bad, with black and
Hispanics most aware of and involved with daily handgun violence;
students believe guns are more common today than at previous times;
and that anti-gun messages need to show more the pain and loss
suffered by victims of gun violence.
   Dwayne Dupuch, a second grader at Coconut Grove Elementary, said
he had never been around a gun but he knew what they could do.
``Kill,'' he said without hesitation. And what had he learned so
far about them?
   ``Not to touch guns,'' said the shy 7-year-old.

   A band of 10 to 12 raiders
attacked a security post near the Irish border with guns and bombs
Wednesday, killing two British soldiers and seriously injuring a
third, police said.
   No group claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on
guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland.
   The gunmen escaped unhurt after the attack at Derryard, an
isolated checkpoint about two miles from the Fermanagh border with
County Monaghan in the Irish Republic, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said.
   The victims were members of the 1st Battalion of the King's Own
Scottish Borderers.
   Six other soldiers and a police officer survived unhurt.
   A police statement gave this account:
   A truck backed up to the checkpoint. As soldiers approached, men
inside opened fire and threw grenades, killing one soldier.
   As the men were firing, a van was driven into the checkpoint and
abandoned. A short time later, it exploded, killing another soldier
and wounding a third.
   The truck sped away. An army patrol spotted it headed for the
border. The patrol fired but the men escaped, abandoning the
vehicle at the border.
   About four hours before the attack, 12 masked gunman with a
truck and van took over a nearby house. They left shortly before
the attack, taking a tractor that had not been recovered.
   The deaths brought to 12 the number of British soldiers killed
in Northern Ireland this year. Up to Wednesday, sectarian violence
in Northern Ireland had killed 60 people this year, including 21
members of security forces.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite the
Protestant-dominated province with the 95 percent Catholic Irish
Republic.

<DATELINE>FORT BENNING, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers marched onto a computerized
Fort Benning range Wednesday to demonstrate four of the world's
most advanced military rifles _ technology the Army hopes will
double the combat effectiveness of U.S. troops in the 21st century.
   Firing single shots and bursts, the helmeted shooters scored
hits on stationary and moving targets up to 300 meters away while
loudspeakers rattled with the sounds of returning ``enemy'' fire to
heighten their stress levels.
   The Army will begin seven months of tests next month to see if
new weapons technology can help soldiers score twice as many hits
on the battlefield despite fear and fast-moving targets.
   Four companies have supplied prototypes for the Army's Advanced
Combat Rifle test. All the rifles fire in the semi-automatic and
fully automatic modes, and three can fire three-shot bursts
designed to overcome aiming errors.
   The Colt Industries' version is derived from the M-16 but has a
redesigned handguard pistol grip and an adjustable buttstock for
improved handling. It fires standard M-16 ammunition or a duplex
cartridge with two rounds.
   Colt says one bullet travels straight to the target; the other
diverges slightly to improve the hit probability.
   A rifle submitted by the AAI Corp. of Hunt Valley, Md., uses a
standard brass cartridge, but the projectile is a steel dart known
as a ``flechette.''
   Flechettes are lighter than bullets, move faster and have a
flatter trajectory that makes them accurate to 600 meters, said
Vernon E. Shisler, the ARC project manager, from Picatinny Arsenal,
N.J.
   A rifle submitted by Steyr-Mannlicher of Steyr, Austria, fires a
steel flechette from a cartridge with a plastic case. The
futuristic-looking Steyr design is shorter than conventional
military rifles because its operating mechanism is in the buttstock.
   The Heckler &amp; Koch prototype, resembling an elongated home video
camera, also has the mechanism in the buttstock. The West German
rifle fires a small bullet from a rectangular ``caseless''
cartridge made from molded propellant. The cartridge is about 1
inch long and three-eighths of an inch square. The H&amp;K and Steyr
ammunition are extremely light.
   Besides the prototypes, soldiers will fire M-16 rifles to
provide control data during the test.
   Shisler said the new rifles are among the world's most advanced
military weapons and the first to include features such as multiple
projectiles and burst firing that help overcome human factors.
   ``We've always wanted a weapon to be reliable, to be accurate to
perform under all kinds of environments and conditions,'' he said.
``These guns are more fireable. They fit the soldier better. ...
What we're trying to do is help compensate for problems the shooter
has because he's scared, because he's in combat.''
   The Army has spent about $40 million since 1982 on research and
development and expects to spend another $17 million by 1991 when
officials decide which technology, if any, to pursue.
   If one of the designs is accepted, soldiers could have the M-16
replacement as early as 1996, officials said at a briefing
Wednesday.
   Starting Jan. 16, the rifles will be tested by teams of 18 Army
and Air Force shooters on a computerized $2.7 million range.
They'll fire at moving and stationary targets from 25 to 600 meters
from prone, standing and foxhole positions.
   Another 18-member team will arrive in April. Ten female shooters
will test the weapons in August and September.
   Each target has curved rods that sense the projectiles'
shockwaves as they travel within 15 feet of the target. So, the
computer not only plots the shooters' hits and displays them on
video monitors, but also their misses.
   Army officials said it's impossible to duplicate combat
conditions, but shooters will feel added stress because of
interservice rivalry and peer pressure. They'll exercise before
firing and wear heart monitors during the tests.
   Army tests indicate an M-16 rifle fired under ideal conditions
can hit 300 meter targets whenever the trigger is pulled. The hit
probability at the same distance drops to about 65 percent during
marksmanship training.
   ``The M-16 was a fine weapon. It's reliable and accurate. It
ranks among the best,'' Shisler said. ``In combat, soldiers are
frightened and don't have time to aim. Our goal is to increase
their effectiveness.''

<TEXT>
   A man accused of plotting to
assassinate President Omar Bongo has died, the second alleged
conspirator to die in custody, the official Gabon news agency AGP
reported Wednesday.
   The agency, citing medical sources, said Doukakas Nziengui died
Tuesday afternoon at Libreville's central hospital of ``excessive
arterial tension.''
   In Strasbourg, France, a group called the International
Committee for Respect and Application of the African Charter of
Human Rights charged that Nziengui died in prison while being
interrogated.
   A second man accused in the case, 39-year-old Richard Anton of
France, died in early November in prison of malaria, the news
agency said.
   Gabonese officials announced in October that they had foiled a
plot to kill Bongo on Sept. 23, saying the conspirators intended to
arrest the prime minister, defense minister and parliament speaker
and take control of the government of this former French colony in
West Africa.
   They said Nziengui, who worked for the Gabon Energy and Water
Co., guided mercenaries on their arrival in the country for the
assassination and paid their hotel bills with his credit card.
   A former Gabonese government official living in Paris, Pierre
Maboundou, was accused of directing the assassination plans.
   Bongo has ruled Gabon, an oil-exporting country, since 1967. He
has not allowed any opposition groups to operate since declaring a
one-party state in 1968 and has been re-elected unopposed four
times, most recently in November 1986.

<TEXT>
   Hungarian Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth said
Wednesday that his country was the first East bloc nation to
``probe the limits of Soviet tolerance'' and that one major goal
now is to avoid an explosion.
   Nemeth's comment came as he cut a scheduled three-day British
visit to 12 hours because of the pace of events at home.
   He cautioned that a proposed austerity budget will provoke
opposition, but said tough measures are Hungary's only hope of
developing a market-oriented economy.
   ``This program is not being applauded by the people ... tensions
will emerge,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter at a news
conference.
   ``What everybody needs to comprehend now is that the future of
the country is at stake. Stability and avoiding an explosion _ this
is one of the main lines of Hungarian policy.''
   Nemeth reacted coolly to a suggestion that Hungary is being
cautious about distancing itself politically from the Soviet Union.
   ``Hungary was the first to probe the limits of Soviet
tolerance,'' Nemeth said, referring to the dissolution of the
Communist Party before the rapid changes in East Germany, Bulgaria
and Czechoslovakia. ``And don't forget, in Hungary this was not
done in the streets.''
   The Hungarian Communist Party disbanded itself in October and
formed the the Hungarian Socialist Party, which espouses democratic
principles. In Hungary's first democratic elections for 41 years
due next year, the party will compete with others for power.
   Nemeth, 41, a reformist member of Hungary's former communist
party, came to Britain as 24 industrialized nations coordinating a
big aid program to Poland and Hungary met in Brussels, Belgium.
   His visit was part of an aggressive campaign for Western aid. He
also wants access to Western high technology denied to communist
countries during the Cold War.
   Western countries have pushed for austerity as a condition for
aid.
   ``We are not able to do it on our own,'' Nemeth said. ``Hungary
is not looking simply for smiles and pats on the back. We need
financial assistance.''
   During his visit, Nemeth conferred with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and said she promised managerial assistance. Britian has
set up two $40 million ``know-how'' funds, one for Poland and one
for Hungary.
   But to unlock aid promised by the International Monetary Fund
and the 24 donor nations, Hungary must adopt the austerity
measures. A Hungarian decision is expected next week.

   The government Wednesday appealed to
Parliament for fast approval of its plans for economic reform but
said it doesn't need special powers to bypass lawmakers as proposed
by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   Deputy Finance Minister Marek Dabrowski told a news conference
that if the austerity measures, tight budget and anti-inflationary
plans succeed, Poland's 900 percent annual inflation rate will
disappear by mid-1990.
   Walesa caused a sensation Tuesday when he said Parliament should
simply grant the government wide powers to put into effect whatever
economic measures it deems necessary to combat the nation's $39
billion foreign debt, widespread shortages of goods and industrial
production problems.
   ``Time is running out,'' Walesa said when he made the proposal.
Parliamentary debate on all the laws could delay the program, he
said.
   However, government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said at
the news conference with Dabrowski that the government was
surprised by Walesa's proposal. She said it will not seek special
powers because it would rather have Parliament approve the
legislation, although ``in a speeded-up way.''
   ``The success of the whole difficult project depends to a great
extent on social support. Thus, the opinion of society's
representation, of Parliament, is of great significance to us,''
said the spokeswoman.
   However, when pressed, she said she could not exclude the
government accepting special powers if Parliament decides to give
them.
   The economic plan of the Solidarity-led government has been
praised by the International Monetary Fund, and Poland and the IMF
will complete ``in the nearest days'' a letter of intent outlining
the program, the official said.
   The IMF would grant about $700 million in loans to Poland in
exchange for the reforms.
   The agreement would also open the door to a broader flow of
credit and financial aid, with promised help from Western countries
already exceeding $3.2 billion, Dabrowski said.
   If the government's plans succeed, the pace of price rises,
currently more than 50 percent a month, should fall to an average
25 percent a month in the first quarter of 1990, said Dabrowski.
They should fall 2 to 3 percent more each month for the rest of
that year, he said.
   Inflation will be cut through reduced government spending and
tax increases to balance the budget, limits on wage increases
through tax penalties, an end to government subsidies to force
inefficient enterprises to close, and making the Polish zloty fully
convertible against hard currencies in Poland.
   The effect will be ``dramatic,'' the deputy minister said. It
may cut real incomes by 20 percent, industrial production by 5
percent, and the gross national product by 2 to 3 percent, he said.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's government has been working
around the clock this week to prepare by Sunday more than a dozen
pieces of legislation to radically transform the economy beginning
Jan. 1.

   Soviet diplomat Yuri Nosenko said
Wednesday that Cuba should take part in the Central America peace
process and help negotiate a cut in the flow of arms to the region.
   ``The time has come in which Cuba must return to the Central
America family in order to negotiate a reduction in the flow of
arms to Central America,'' Nosenko told The Associated Press in an
interview.
   Nosenko is from the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Latin American
Department.
   He said he came here to take a closer look at a summit of five
Central American presidents. The meeting concluded Tuesday with a
call for the demobilization of Salvadoran leftist guerrillas and
U.S.-supported Nicaraguan Contras and an end to all help for
insurgents in the region.
   The presidents asked the superpowers not to interfere in Central
America.
   ``If Cuba takes part directly in the negotiations we can know
its position and try to gain some kind of accord,'' Nosenko said
before returning to Moscow.
   He refused to elaborate, but said the United States and the
Soviet Union should guarantee the accords reached by the Central
American presidents.
   ``I think the United States and the Soviet Union are very close
in their positions, because both countries want a diplomatic
solution to the crisis in this region,'' Nosenko said.
   Nosenko reiterated that the Soviet Union stopped all arms
shipments to Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government last year.
   However, the United States said last week that a Soviet ship
with a cargo of helicopters was due Dec. 18 at Corinto, Nicaragua,
on the Pacific coast.

   Warner Home Video's ``Batman'' has set
records in the video rental business, with 9.8 transactions counted
in two weeks, according to the New York research firm of Alexander
&amp; Associates.
   The somber comic book hero's clash with the Joker rang up an
estimated $21 million in rentals from its Nov. 17 release until
Dec. 4, eclipsing ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' by more than 3
million ``turns,'' said Robert Alexander, the firm's president.
   ``Batman'' also helped carry the video industry to its best week
overall, said Alexander, who counted 94.8 million video rentals for
the week ending on Dec. 4.
   The previous high was 91.8 million in rentals, set in the last
week of November 1988, when ``E.T.'' was released.
   When it comes to video sales, however, it appears that MCA Home
Video's ``E.T.'' probably will outperform ``Batman.''
   Analysts estimate that about 4.2 million copies of ``Batman''
have been sold, with about 1.3 million representing sales to video
rental operators.
   Retailers indicated that ``Batman'' sales are about half the
pace of ``E.T.''

<TEXT>
   The district attorney acknowledged Wednesday
that he is investigating charges that the Rev. Bruce Ritter,
founder of the Covenant House for homeless youth, improperly spent
the shelter's funds.
   After nearly two days of silence amid news reports that Ritter
provided an apartment, money and gifts to a young male prostitute
and took him on trips, Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau issued a statement saying the probe was in its
``earliest stages.''
   ``No determination has been made as to the truth of the
allegations, nor can such a determination be made until the
investigation has been concluded,'' Morgenthau said.
   But he said, ``Press reports of leaks attributed to unnamed law
enforcement officials are inaccurate, may unfairly damage
reputations and can only impede the investigation.''
   Spokesmen for Covenant House denied the young man's allegations.
``We categorically deny any kind of (illicit) relationship between
Father Ritter and this youth,'' said James Harnett, the shelter's
chief executive officer.
   The New York Post reported Wednesday that investigators had the
youth wear a recording device during a conversation with Ritter in
an effort to confirm the illicit sex allegations.
   A law enforcement source told The Associated Press the youth's
name was Timothy Warner, 20.
   It is not clear whether Warner managed to record anything but
Harnett said Ritter suspected at the time that he was ``possibly
being set up.'' He added that he was not concerned about anything
Ritter may have said.
   ``I think it was outrageous and disgusting for the district
attorney to outfit this kid with a wire to try to entrap Father
Ritter,'' Harnett said. ``I can tell you Father Ritter is a lot
calmer about this than I am.''
   The law enforcement source, who spoke to The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity, said the probe began after Warner took his
allegations and ``documentation'' to the district attorney's office.
   The source said the young man worked in Covenant House's
computer operation and was able to obtain printouts about
expenditures that he gave investigators.
   Investigators are looking into the matter as possible financial
misconduct, the source said.
   Morgenthau said Covenant House staffers are cooperating fully
with the investigation and no subpoenas have been necessary.
   Ritter, 62, a Franciscan priest, brought Warner to New York from
New Orleans in February after the young man told the priest he
wanted to escape prostitution. Ritter called the allegations
``scurrilous'' lies and said the young man had emotional problems.
   The Post, meanwhile, reported that a female employee at Covenant
House had said Ritter might have been involved with a second youth.
Officials of the district attorney's office refused to comment.
   Ritter has hired a criminal defense attorney, Stanley Arkin.
   ``There is no case and there never was any case'' against
Ritter, Arkin said.
   John Cardinal O'Connor, who had been silent on the case, issued
a statement in support of Ritter. ``In all my personal association
with Father Ritter and those who work with him, I have seen nothing
but self-sacrifice and commitment to the most abandoned in society.
   ``As archbishop of New York, I have held Father Ritter's work in
high esteem,'' O'Connor said.
   Ritter's Covenant House opened in 1969 after six teens showed up
at his apartment looking for a place to stay, according to
spokesmen for the shelter. Since then the organization has grown
into an $85 million-a-year operation with seven shelters in the
United States, one in Toronto, and four in Latin America.
   The organization gets more than 90 percent of its funds from
private donations.

   A Texas appeals court set aside the
conviction of death row inmate Clarence Lee Brandley on Wednesday,
more than two years after a judge ruled the black man was unfairly
tried in the slaying of a white teen-ager.
   ``This will make this Christmas as bright as can be. It was
worth the wait,'' Brandley said from the visiting area of death
row, where he spent nearly nine years and once came within six days
of execution before getting a stay.
   ``It's been a long time,'' Brandley, 38, said after he was told
the court's decision. ``I'm very thankful. I didn't know what it
was going to, when it was going to be. It's a prayer that's been
answered. It's going to take some time to sink in _ to soak in.''
   In a 6-3 decision, the appellate court said Brandley did not get
a fair trial when a jury convicted him of the 1980 strangulation
and rape of a teen-ager at Conroe High School, where Brandley was a
janitor.
   His first trial ended with a hung jury. An all-white jury found
him guilty in a second trial. Brandley's attorneys and supporters
contended the conviction was racially motivated.
   Then on Oct. 9, 1987, after a 10-day evidentiary hearing moved
from Conroe to Galveston, retired state District Judge Perry
Pickett recommended that Brandley get a new trial because the
previous two had been tainted with racism.
   In Wednesday's decision, the Austin-based appeals court said the
state's investigation of the slaying led to a trial that lacked
``the rudiments of fairness'' and ordered Brandley released to the
custody of the Montgomery County sheriff for a possible new trial.
   Montgomery County District Attorney Peter Speers said Wednesday
he was ``obviously disappointed'' with the court's ruling.
   ``I felt the conviction should have been upheld,'' said Speers,
who declined to comment further until he had reviewed the court's
decision. He planned a Thursday afternoon press conference,
possibly to discuss whether he will pursue a third trial.
   Prosecutors have maintained that Brandley is guilty and denied
allegations that he was the subject of racial discrimination.
   Brandley is the third Texas inmate in a year whose conviction
has been set aside in cases that have drawn national attention.
   The court set aside the capital murder conviction of Randall
Dale Adams, whose case was the subject of the movie ``The Thin Blue
Line,'' for the 1976 slaying of a Dallas police officer. The court
later set aside the robbery conviction of Joyce Ann Brown, a Dallas
woman who prosecutors say will be tried again for her alleged part
in the 1980 robbery of a fur store.
   The court said the outrage over the teen-ager's murder ``cannot
justify the subversion of justice that took place during the
investigation, which ultimately affected the trial of her accused
perpetrator.''
   Brandley's attorney, Mike DeGeurin of Houston, said he would ask
the court to set bail for his client and hoped Brandley would be
home for Christmas.
   The appeals court refused Wednesday afternoon to set bond, and
DeGeurin's bail motion in a Galveston district court was not ruled
on by late Wednesday afternoon from the 122nd district court in
Galveston.
   Brandley's attorneys offered evidence that police and Montgomery
County prosecutors had set out to prove that Brandley, the only
black janitor at the school, was guilty, rather than seeking the
real killer.
   Another janitor who testified for the state allegedly was
threatened by a Texas Ranger, and the state suppressed information
that could have implicated someone other than Brandley, according
to examples of improper investigation cited by the appeals court.
   ``I'm sitting here screaming having a fit, I'm so happy,'' said
Rose Upshaw of the Free Clarence Brandley Coalition, a 200-member,
Houston-based group that has fought to keep Brandley's case in the
public eye. ``We're just excited. We just can't believe it.''
   ``Thank-you Jesus!'' said Brandley's mother, Minnie Ola
Brandley, when she was told of the court's decision. ``Pray for us
and let's hope everything works out.''
   ``I'm thrilled to death for Clarence and his family,'' said
James Beathard, a fellow inmate. ``But I hope nobody out there
makes the corny comment that the system works. The system failed
Clarence. It's been eight years. And there are more and more of
these cases coming up.''

   The government announced its economic recovery
plan Wednesday, promising five more years of bureaucratic control
of such mundane details of life as the number of eggs produced for
each Soviet consumer.
   Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov rejected radical reforms like the
legalization of private property and the selling off of
money-losing state enterprises, drawing immediate scorn from
disappointed progressives in the Soviet Parliament.
   If bureaucrats really want to raise annual egg production _
targeted at 285 per person by 1995 _ they should raise chickens,
economist and parliamentarian Gavriil Popov told Parliament, known
as the Congress of People's Deputies.
   ``Five years ago, we said it was a choice between five-year
plans and perestroika, and unfortunately, it turns out the
five-year plan has won,'' said fellow deputy Pavel Bunich, in the
lobby outside the snow-covered Kremlin's Palace of Congresses.
   The government proposal shifts the emphasis of traditional
central planning away from heavy industry to consumer goods and
services. They are to quadruple in the next five-year plan, from
1991-96. It also would transfer some control from bureaucrats in
Moscow to those in the republics.
   Elsewhere in the East bloc Wednesday:
   _ Czechoslovakia's opposition and Communists agreed that the
president should be elected by Parliament before Jan. 31, according
to negotiators. There was no agreement on who would become
president, only that the person would be a Czech not affiliated to
any political party.
   That seems to point toward opposition leader Vaclav Havel, a
symbol of the country's peaceful revolution. Earlier, the new
opposition-dominated government said it is drafting laws ensuring
freedom of religion, assembly and association.
   _ Bulgaria's Communist Party expelled Todor Zhivkov, the
hard-line leader ousted last month after a 35-year rule, and agreed
to join other Warsaw Pact parties in surrendering its guarantee of
supreme power.
   _ Communists in East Germany said talk of reunification raises
the specter of a ``Fourth Reich,'' but West German plans for
massive aid infusions indicate the countries are quickly coming
together.
   _ Poles marked the eighth anniversary of the 1981 martial-law
crackdown, which Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said should be a
reminder of the need for ``pluralism and tolerance.''
   _ Poland and Hungary outlined their economic reforms at a
meeting in Brussels, with 24 Western nations that are coordinating
aid to prevent Eastern Europe's reforms from being derailed by
economic troubles.
   Ryzhkov said the Kremlin believes it can salvage the sinking
Soviet economy without resorting to Western economic models. He
claimed his plan was a radical reform ``for carrying the economy
out of a crisis.''
   Food and consumer goods are in painfully short supply and
authorities are wondering whether they'll have enough fuel to heat
apartments through the long winter.
   Moscow deputy Yuri Andreev said the plan was so bad he hoped the
Congress would throw it back at the government for a complete
rewrite. Moreover, he suggested the ministers responsible be
replaced.
   The government's moves toward a market economy are vague and
fragmented, dooming them from the start, said Popov, one of 300
deputies who signed up to comment.
   ``You can't assemble it gradually,'' he said. ``You can't have
the carburetor working while the starter is idle. If the motor is
working, it must be working completely.''
   ``Enterprises are drowning, not because they don't know how to
swim, but because the center has tied their hands,'' he said.
   Ryzhkov's program was a clear victory for the conservatives, who
dominate the Parliament. Ryzhkov even rejected the program of his
own top economist, Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin, who had urged the
sale of unprofitable state enterprises beginning in 1991.
   Communist Party agriculture chief Yegor K. Ligachev stood up to
reject reformers' suggestions that ``small peasant holdings'' could
solve the country's food crisis. He said the only reason huge
collective farms cannot feed the Soviet people is lack of
technology and cash, and announced that they turned a profit of $10
billion last year _ for the first time in their 60 years of
existence.
   It was not clear how Ligachev arrived at the profit figure.
While this year's harvest was good, there have been no reports of
drastic improvements in farm productivity or increases in state
prices that would explain such a sudden jump in profits.
   The proposal calls for control to shift from bureaucrats in
Moscow to bureaucrats and factory managers in the republics.
Despite lip service to creation of a ``socialist market,'' consumer
demand still would not drive Soviet decisions about design,
production and distribution.
   ``Does this mean we abandon planning? Of course not,'' Ryzhkov
said. ``We have to leave free to the market only that part of
production that would not lead to unbalancing the economy.''
   Price reform would be postponed until 1991 and 1992, and even
then, some would remain under state control.
   The Soviet Union desperately needs to reform its state-set
prices, which waste enormous resources by charging too little for
scarce and expensive goods.
   Ryzhkov indicated that every plan for price reform had been
opposed.
   The program did include surface changes, including the creation
of government bonds, raising interest rates, and long-term land
leasing.
   The 2,250-member Parliament interrupted the premier's 1-hour,
45-minute speech with lukewarm applause only when Ryzhkov declared
the state would remain the owner of ``means of production'' _
factories and equipment.
   Ryzhkov said the government would begin using more economic
rather than managerial means to run the economy in a second stage
of reform beginning in 1993. He specifically cited control of
prices, credit and investment.
   His report appeared to contain nothing that would give Soviets
an incentive to work efficiently.

<TEXT>
   Despite concerns about security, the White
House said Wednesday that President Bush will go to violence-torn
Colombia on Feb. 15 for a four-nation summit on illegal drugs.
   The meeting, expected to last one day, will be in Cartagena on
Colombia's north coast.
   The region is infamous as a haven for cocaine druglords, who are
waging a campaign of violence in retaliation for a crackdown by the
government of President Virgilio Barco.
   Other participants, in addition to Bush and Barco, will be
President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of
Bolivia.
   On Monday, Bush had expressed determination to attend the summit
but said a final decision was still pending and ``I will not do
anything imprudent.''
   Praising Barco for battling the drug cartel, Bush has said, ``I
don't want to undermine the courageous stances he's taking. ... And
I don't want to be the one that sends a signal that nobody should
go to Colombia because they can't be protected.''
   One top administration official said Wednesday night the drug
summit probably will be held at a Colombian naval base. The
official said that for better overall security the entire
Washington entourage, including staff and the press corps, would
remain at the same location, rather than operating from separate
site than the talks, as is often the case on presidential foreign
trips.
   Wednesday's announcement came after Bush signed legislation
authorizing $240 million in aid for Colombia, Bolivia and Peru to
help the Andean nations wage their war against drugs.
   The three South American nations are the source of most of the
world's cocaine supply.
   Bush had promised the increased aid as part of the anti-drug
strategy he unveiled Sept. 5.
   The legislation authorizes spending $115 million for narcotics
control assistance and $125 million for military and law
enforcement aid to the three countries.
   Bush reiterated his commitment to help the nations that ``form
the front lines of the struggle against the drug cartels.''
   Disrupting and dismantling ``the criminal organizations that
support the international production, processing and trafficking of
drugs are essential components of our national drug control
strategy,'' he said.
   The violence in Colombia since President Virgilio Barco declared
war on the drug cartels ``shows that they are entrenched and
powerful. International cooperation is essential if they are to be
defeated, and the United States, in particular, must be generous in
providing assistance,'' Bush said.
   The measure waives restrictions on using U.S. foreign aid to
train police. It also raises from $500,000 to $2 million the
rewards the United States will pay for information leading to
arrest and prosecution of international terrorists.
   While praising Congress ``for this timely response to my
request,'' Bush also registered an exception to a provision that
would allow either House to block aid if the State Department fails
to submit certain reports. Bush regards any such legislative veto
provision as unconstitutional.

   A woman who walked away from prison nearly
12 years ago and lived a model life until her arrest last year was
granted parole Wednesday and is to be released Friday.
   ``I just ask for forgiveness,'' Kay Smith, 38, told the state
parole board during a 15-minute hearing. ``I just want you to know
I have changed my way of thinking.''
   Mrs. Smith was serving a 12-year sentence for the armed robbery
of a jewelry store when she escaped. While a fugitive, she earned a
high school diploma, overcame drug and alcohol abuse, remarried and
began a successful career in real estate.
   The Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services board,
which rejected Mrs. Smith's request for parole in May, voted 6-1
for parole on Wednesday.
   The Severn, Md., woman is to be released Friday from the Women's
Correctional Center in Columbia.
   ``I'm sure it's going to be hard to stay in a little cell,''
knowing freedom is imminent, Mrs. Smith said at a news conference
after the vote.
   The board stipulated that Mrs. Smith will be supervised by
Maryland authorities until March 1996. She also must make
restitution to the jewelry store she robbed of $4,300 in cash and
jewelry in 1974.
   In January 1978, Mrs. Smith, then known as Pamela Rodgers,
walked away from a work-release center in Columbia, and embarked on
her new life.
   In May 1988, police tipped by her ex-husband, Daniel Rodgers,
arrested the South Carolina native at her new home in Severn. Only
then did her second husband, Ray Smith, and her sons, Daniel
Rodgers, 19, and James Rodgers, 18, learn her past.
   After her capture, South Carolina allowed Mrs. Smith to serve
her time at a prison in Jessup, Md., so she could be near her
family. She was brought to Columbia this week for the parole
hearing.
   Mrs. Smith said she plans to recruit and train real estate
agents, and try to lead a normal life without fear of the law. ``I
hope to just be settled and have a routine day with a routine job
and a routine home life,'' she said.
   Mrs. Smith expressed regret over her past, saying, ``I wish that
I could take it all back but I can't.''
   Marion Beasley, the lone dissenter in Wednesday's parole board
vote, noted that Mrs. Smith was indicted on five counts of armed
robbery and twice fled custody _ the first time in October 1975
when she walked out of a Greenville corrections facility. She was
captured the same day.
   But a police officer in Greenville who worked on Mrs. Smith's
case and the solicitor who prosecuted her last year for the escape
charge both wrote letters to the board recommending her for parole.

   Friends of Jennifer Casolo said Wednesday the
announcement by Salvadoran officials of her release proved her
innocence. A senator said the move averted a rift in
U.S.-Salvadoran relations.
   Casolo, 28 and a native of Thomaston, Conn., had been accused of
storing weapons for leftist rebels in San Salvador, where President
Alfredo Cristiani said the church worker would be freed and
expelled despite his being ``morally convinced that Miss Casolo is
quilty.''
   Ms. Casolo arrived in Miami Wednesday night.
   Salvadoran officials said prosecutors had failed to develop
sufficient evidence linking Ms. Casolo to a cache of weapons found
buried behind her house the day of her arrest Nov. 26.
   ``You don't know whether to laugh because you're happy or cry
because you're happy,'' said Susanna Wallace of the Christian
Education Seminar in San Antonio, Texas, the lay church group that
sent Casolo to El Salvador to conduct non-partisan tours of the
country for church workers and visiting officials.
   Wallace, who wept as she spoke of Casolo, said, ``We hope this
helps stop the persecution of church workers that's going on in El
Salvador. ... This confirms our standing all along of her
innocence.''
   Casolo's father, John Casolo, speaking at a news conference
Wednesday in the Wethersfield, Conn., office of Sen. Christopher
Dodd, thanked volunteers and officials ``for bringing our daughter
home.'' Her mother, Audrey Casolo, added, ``I am deeply grateful to
each and every one who has believed in Jennifer and her innocence.''
   Dodd, who had spoken by telephone several times with Cristiani
over the last several days, said the decision to free Casolo was a
favorable development in relations between the two countries.
   ``I welcome this announcement for the signal it sends about the
legal system in El Salvador _ a system that has not exactly
distinguished itself for fairness or even humaneness in recent
years,'' Dodd said.
   Dodd, a moderate Democrat who has supported military aid to
Cristiani's government, praised Cristiani's handling of the matter
and stressed that he had made no threats or promises about his
support for continued U.S. aid.
   ``There were no deals. There are no conditions on aid,'' Dodd
said.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said the release of Casolo,
``certainly avoids what could have been a disaster in terms of
their relationship with the United States.''
   He added, ``The result, whether it was judicially motivated or
politically motivated or both, is very positive.''
   But other congressmen said the resolution of Casolo's case does
not resolve problems for church workers still held in El Salvador.
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., who visited Casolo in prison, said:
   ``There are many individuals who do not receive such fortunate
treatment and who do not have the benefit of so many friends in
America. Our relief at Jennifer's release must not diminish our
concern for the many other church workers she leaves behind.''
   And Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. and an opponent of military aid to
El Salvador, predicted that persecution of other church workers
would not end.
   ``One has to ask: If the government did not have the evidence to
bring her to trial, why did it see fit to deport her?'' he
commented.
   Friends and officials viewed the decision to expel Casolo as
necessary to protect her.
   Steve Gans, a Brandeis University classmate of Casolo's, said,
``It's not a fair result in the sense that any sort of guilt would
come with that.''
   Wallace said she was ``very sensitive to how she feels about
leaving the country.'' Casolo has been in El Salvador since 1985
and has said she wanted to stay, even if that meant standing trial.
   Dodd said he too regretted the expulsion but added that, ``in
terms of personal safety, (it) is probably in Jennifer's best
interest.''

   William J. Bennett on Wednesday described the
views of those who advocate the legalization of drugs as ``stupid
and morally atrocious.''
   ``It doesn't make any sense,'' Bennett, director of the Office
of National Drug Control Policy, said in an interview.
   ``It is becoming something of a fashion to believe this in
certain circles of opinion. But even though it's fashionable, it's
still every bit as dumb and compassionless as it was before.''
   Bennett pressed his counter-offensive against the increasingly
outspoken ranks of those arguing for drug legalization a day after
U.S. District Judge Robert W. Sweet said drugs _ including cocaine
and heroin _ should be legalized, taxed and dispensed by the state
because the war on narcotics is being lost.
   Sweet, a Republican and former prosecutor appointed by President
Carter as a trial judge in the Southern District of New York, said
it was ``time to abolish the prohibition _ to cease treating
indulgence in mind-alteration as a crime.''
   Bennett, who denounced such views in a speech at Harvard
University on Monday, said Wednesday that he is unswayed by the
growth in the number of legalization advocates or by the fact that
they cut across the political spectrum and include, for the first
time, a federal judge.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, visiting Kansas City, said the judge
was ``simply out of step with mainstream America ... We totally
reject the idea that the way to solve the drug problem challenging
America is to simply roll over and legalize it. It's not going to
happen in the Bush administration.''
   ``Judges aren't any more immune to ignorance than people in
other professions,'' Bennett said.
   ``If he doesn't like his work, if he's tired of sentencing
people, he should find another line of work,'' Bennett said about
Sweet. ``It's better to have clogged courts ... than crowded,
jammed pediatric wards of cocaine babies, which we will have a lot
more of if we take his proposal seriously.''
   The legalization argument ``is as stupid and morally atrocious
as it ever was,'' Bennett said.
   Sweet, in Tuesday's speech before the New Yrk Cosmopolitan Club,
said the result of drug legalization ``would be the elimination of
the profit motive, the gangs, the drug dealers. Obviously, the
model is the repeal of Prohibition and the end of Al Capone and
Dutch Shultz.''
   Sweet was harshly criticized by other officials, including Sen.
Alfonse D-Amato, R-N.Y.
   ``Judge Sweet is absolutely wrong,'' D'Amato said. ``If his
policy were accepted, he would be consigning millions of more to
lives of addictions. He would be responsible for the deaths of
millions more. ... It is a policy that is irresponsible.''
   Sterling Johnson Jr., the special New York state prosecutor for
narcotics, agreed with D'Amato.
   ``This is a classic case of Sweet going sour,'' Johnson said.
   Pat Walsh, Sweet's secretary, said the judge was conducting a
trial Wednesday and was not available for comment.
   The ranks of drug legalization advocates include conservative
political commentator William F. Buckley, economist Milton Friedman
and Baltimore's Democratic Mayor Kurt Schmoke.
   President Reagan's Secretary of State George P. Shultz rattled
the Bush administration by stating similar views in a speech given
at Stanford University and excerpted in the Wall Street Journal in
October.
   Bennett said he doesn't believe the arguments will ``change the
basic views of most Americans. They've seen it up close. Anybody
who has seen a child go through this is not likely to be moved by
this abstract argument.''
   Bennett said he opposes legalizing any kind of drug, even
marijuana, despite the fact that he doesn't believe it's more
harmful than alcohol.
   ``The last thing I would want to do is recommend the wider use
of a drug that makes young people stupid. ... We have enough of a
problem with liquor, thank you.''
   But he's not advocating a return to Prohibition: ``We can't go
back. Society's made a judgment it's OK. But we certainly don't
have to compound the problem.''

<HEAD>Britain Calls for Lifting Sanctions to End Apartheid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain said Wednesday the way to end
apartheid in South Africa is by gradually lifting economic
sanctions as the government dismantles its segregation system
rather than imposing a trade embargo.
   Attempts to isolate the government of South African President
F.W. de Klerk are not the answer, British Ambassador Sir Crispin
Tickell told the General Assembly's Special Session on Apartheid.
   ``Nor are sanctions. ... They certainly weaken the South African
economy, and in doing so they increase misery and poverty, in
particular among the most vulnerable parts of the community,'' its
black majority, he said.
   ``Their political effect is to increase resistance to change
rather than to encourage it,'' Tickell said. ``When Mr. de Klerk
does take the necessary steps, we believe it would then be right to
lift some of the measures imposed by the international community,
so as to acknowledge progress and encourage South Africa to proceed
further down the path of dialogue.''
   Tickell's advice received polite applause; in the 159-member
General Assembly, the overwhelming majority of nations believe
South Africa is implementing limited reforms only in response to
the limited sanctions imposed so far.
   Most nations favor a total, mandatory trade embargo against
South Africa, butthe United States and Britain have used their veto
power in the Security Council to consistently block such moves.
   A General Assembly call for all nations to sever economic,
military, sports and cultural links with South Africa also has met
with partial success.
   Apartheid has established a racially segregated society in which
the 28 million South African blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Autopsy Awaited on Man Mauled by Dogs</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   DULZURA, Calif. _ The death of a man apparently mauled by a pack
of dogs could lead to a criminal investigation of the animals'
owners, whose fearful neighbors had complained about marauding
dogs, the sheriff's office said.
   Preliminary findings of the autopsy Wednesday will be available
Thursday morning, but if it attributes 69-year-old Roy Johnson's
death to the dogs, the criminal probe would ensue, Sheriff's Lt.
John Tenwolde said Wednesday.
   ``A lot of questions need to be asked before we can speculate
about what the outcome is going to be,'' Tenwolde said.
   On Tuesday, Johnson was attacked near the Charles Duarte Ranch,
where the dogs apparently lived, while he was walking to work.
   Duarte was unavailable for comment, but his wife, Cindy, said:
``It has never happened before. I can't imagine what happened.''
   Bill Delany, caretaker of the Monahan Ranch where Johnson
worked, found the body after driving to pick up his newspaper at
his mailbox off the highway.
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Delany said. ``He appeared to have been
eaten alive. That's the only way to describe it. He was eaten
alive. I just knew he was gone.''
   John Slough, an off-duty San Diego policeman who lives nearby,
went to investigate what he thought was a dogfight and found two
dogs picking at the body. They attacked him and he shot and killed
one and wounded another, police said.
   Sally Hazzard, head of the San Diego County Animal Control
Department, said seven dogs licensed to Duarte had been impounded.
   Hazzard said the dog wounded by Slough was being treated by
department veterinarians. She said all the dogs would remain in
department custody.
   ``The department has had contacts with Mr. Duarte and his dogs
prior to the unfortunate incident and all documentation relative to
those contacts have been forwarded to the sheriff's homicide
unit,'' Hazzard said.
   Johnson had complained in the past about the unrestrained dogs
and family members said he had been bitten on at least one other
occassion.
   His friends and relatives also said the dogs' owners have
refused repeated requests to keep their pets fenced in or on
leashes.
   Muriel Curtis, a neighbor, said she no longer walks along the
dirt roads because of the dogs.
   ``Those dogs were so vicious that, even when they were behind a
fence, my dogs panicked,'' Curtis said. ``I had to give up my walks
because those dogs were so threatening.''
   San Diego police investigator Pete Solomonsen, who is married to
Johnson's niece, Deanne, said the dogs often run in a pack of six
to 12, menacing neighbors and passers-by.
   Delany said: ``The dogs always chase my truck, and they've
attacked me on my horse.''

   Tennessee's secretary of state,
reportedly under investigation by federal authorities when he put a
gun in his mouth and fired, suffered swelling in his brain
Wednesday, a hospital spokesman said.
   Doctors said that was to be expected, and treated the condition
with drugs, and Gentry Crowell, 57, remained in critical but stable
condition at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said spokesman
Wayne Wood.
   Crowell was found Tuesday morning by one of his sons on the
porch of his home in Lebanon, about 30 miles east of Nashville. The
.38-caliber pistol was next to him.
   He was taken to the hospital in Nashville, where he underwent a
four-hour operation.
   The Nashville Banner reported Tuesday that federal authorities
investigating illegal bingo gambling and public corruption had been
closing in on Crowell.
   The Banner quoted unidentified sources as saying that
investigators were focusing on how Crowell solicited political
campaign money from architects, engineers and bingo operators.
   The investigation has lasted four years. Since January, the
probe has resulted in 22 people being indicted or pleading guilty.
   Crowell's former chief bingo inspector, W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker,
is serving a seven-year federal prison sentence on a conviction
that includes extorting payoffs from bingo operators.
   His former assistant, Mary Sue Wright, was named an unindicted
co-conspirator in an illegally operated Memphis bingo hall and
given immunity from prosecution. She resigned in August before
giving testimony before the U.S. grand jury in Memphis.
   Bingo, previously legal for charity, was outlawed this year when
the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled it a lottery, violating the state
constitution.
   Republican state Sen. Ronnie Greer and Bob Lynch, a former
assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted former Gov. Ray Blanton on
liquor license conspiracy charges, said Wednesday that the
investigation had paralyzed state government.
   ``I think it would be in everyone's interest if this case were
concluded,'' said Greer.
   Less than five months ago, state Rep. Ted Ray Miller of
Knoxville killed himself following published reports that he had
taken bribes in connection with a Knox County waste disposal
project.
   Neither Crowell nor Miller had been indicted. Crowell testified
before federal grand juries in Nashville and Memphis about bingo
regulation.
   ``The simple fact that this kind of investigation draws so much
attention, they (prosecutors) run the risk of destroying some
people's lives,'' Lynch said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bob Washko, lead prosecutor in the
bingo-corruption case in Nashville, was unavailable for comment,
his office said.
   Lynch is defending state Rep. Tommy Burnett, a Democrat, on
multiple charges growing out of an illegal bingo operation.

   Lawmakers on Wednesday approved a
bill affirming President Corazon Aquino's emergency powers after
last week's failed coup but limiting them to three months and
rejecting some tough measures proposed to restore order.
   Mrs. Aquino declared an indefinite state of emergency Dec. 6 and
this week asked Congress to grant specific powers under the
declaration.
   The bill approved Wednesday by the House of Representatives
limits the powers to 90 days. The Senate version could extend them
up to six months. The Senate will resume debate on its version
Thursday.
   Renegade troops surrendered their last stronghold Saturday after
at least 113 people died in the rebellion that began Dec. 1.
However, authorities say about half the estimated 3,000 troops who
took part in the coup attempt are still at large.
   Both congressional bills would let authorities search for
weapons and ammunition in private homes without normal legal
constraints.
   But searches and seizures would be ``in the context of
constitutional guarantees'' under the House version, meaning a
warrant would be required, Rep. Edcel Lagman, sponsor of the
amendment, said.
   Another amendment says measures to put down the rebellion must
be ``within the protection of the bill of rights.''
   The House Rules Committee, dominated by pro-administration
stalwarts, proposed a six-month emergency period and its section on
searches and seizures did not refer to constitutional guarantees or
the bill of rights.
   The House voted against letting Mrs. Aquino intervene in labor
disputes and suspend labor laws. The Senate version would keep the
provision, which critics regard as a virtual ban on strikes.
   Mrs. Aquino said she needed stronger powers to search for
weapons and rebels still at large. Business groups asked for curbs
on strikes to enhance confidence among investors.
   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile denounced Mrs. Aquino's emergency decree
as a move toward dictatorship. Former human rights lawyer Sen. Rene
Saguisag defended it because of the coup attempt.
   Emergency powers also could be used in extending the lease on
the U.S. military bases in the Philippines and approving them would
have ``dire implications'' for civil liberties, said Enrile, a
defense minister and martial law administrator under President
Ferdinand Marcos from 1972 to 1981.
   Enrile broke with Marcos and joined a popular uprising that
installed Mrs. Aquino as president in February 1986 and drove
Marcos into exile in Hawaii, where he died. Enrile later joined the
opposition to Mrs. Aquino.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said Wednesday that rebels who
attempted the coup were still capable of staging terror attacks and
assassinations. He said the government will no longer seek U.S. air
cover over Philippine territory.
   U.S. jets flew ``persuasion flights'' to discourage more bombing
runs on the Malacanang presidential palace and the military
headquarters by rebel aircraft, turning the tide in favor of the
government on the first day of the mutiny.

   A communist congress endorsed a
multiparty system and free elections for Croatia Wednesday, opening
the way for a non-communist government in Yugoslavia's
second-largest republic for the first time in 44 years.
   The congress also elected Ivica Racan, 49, as new leader of the
Croatian Communist Party. Racan, who has publicly advocated radical
democratic reforms within communist Yugoslavia, received 41 votes
in a secret ballot in the Central Committee. The only other
candidate, Ivo Druzic, received 29 votes.
   Dragutin Dimitrovic, a member of the party's decision-making
Central Committee, said the party by its actions ``is showing its
readiness to put its platform to the public for approval.''
   Twelve burgeoning political opposition movements already exist
in the central Yugoslav republic and seek official legalization.
   Parliamentary elections are scheduled in April.
   Yugoslavia is in its worst crisis since the communists
consolidated power in 1945. The question of pluralism instead of
continued one-party rule is straining already tenuous ties between
some republics and a moribund economy heightens tensions.
   The liberal northern republic of Slovenia was until now the only
of Yugoslavia's six constituent regions to openly advocate
introduction of Western-style democracy.
   The communist leadership of Serbia, the largest republic,
vehemently opposes introduction of a multiparty system both in
Serbia and federally.
   Last month, Serbia severed all business and official ties with
Slovenia.

<TEXT>
   A special panel on drug trafficking
charged Wednesday that the daughter of the defense minister and her
husband were involved in the cocaine trade.
   The commission said Tania Regalado, daughter of Defense Minister
Humberto Regalado Hernandez, and her husband, Tony Mateo, smuggled
U.S.-bound cocaine into Honduras in electrical appliances from
Panama.
   The panel said she ``took advantage'' of her well-known name to
bring the drug-laden items into Honduras without interference from
airport authorities.
   Carlos Sosa Coello, a spokesman for the Special Narcotics
Investigative Commission, said her whereabouts are not known and
she is presumed to have fled the country.
   Mateo had been arrested in Guatemala and handed over to U.S.
authorities in Miami. However, he was later freed for lack of
evidence.
   The defense minister's stepbrother and a former ambassador to
Panama, ex-Col. Rigoberto Regalado Lara, is serving a 10-year
sentence in Miami for cocaine trafficking.
   Regalado Lara was arrested at the Miami airport on May 15 with
25 pounds of cocaine in his suitcase. He was dismissed from the
armed forces and stripped of his diplomatic status.
   ``Honduras has been a transit point for U.S.-bound narcotics
since the last part of the 1970s,'' the panel said. It said
Honduran authorities confiscated 18,480 pounds of Colombian cocaine
from 1984 to 1988.
   It said ``a favorite technique'' of drug traffickers has been to
buy influence from military leaders with costly gifts and business
partnerships. The report was the first from the nine-person
commission created in June by the legislature. The results of the
ongoing inquiry are to be handed over to judicial officials.

   An electrician who slept on the streets after
losing his job and his family said he won a position as a teacher
at a technical school because he refused to give up hope.
   Allen Delano Johnson, 42, said he learned where to get free
coffee and find shelter while living on the street, but kept
thinking there must be a way out.
   ``I can still remember that I wanted to find a job. But how? I
stunk and was dirty,'' Johnson said recently. ``Who in his right
mind would hire me?
   ``I finally went to a shelter because I knew the people who ran
them knew how to help me get back on my feet.''
   Johnson isn't homeless any more. He learned new skills through
Jubilee Soup Kitchen's career development program, and teaches
commercial and residential electrical installation at Triangle Tech
School.
   Johnson said he found his life going into a tailspin after
returning to his native Lorain, Ohio, in 1984 from the San
Francisco Bay Area, where he'd worked as an electrician for years.
   His electrical contracting business in Lorain failed, and a
breakup with his wife, June, followed.
   Johnson came to Pittsburgh almost three years ago because he had
relatives in the city, but said he was unable to break into the
skilled electrician's field.
   ``Then, when I filled out applications for lower paying jobs,
they would look at my trade experience and tell me I was
overqualified,'' he said. ``I finally got some odd jobs through a
temporary job placement service by lying on my application and
saying that my only skill was as a dishwasher.''
   Johnson took his first step back when a caseworker introduced
him to Jubilees' 12-week career program.
   He was offered the job at Triangle Tech even though he had no
teaching experience.
   Ralph Hathaway of Triangle Tech said Johnson's positive attitude
was a deciding factor when he hired him to start work Oct. 2.
   ``He wasn't mad at the world because of what happened to him,''
he said. ``He just wanted to put it all behind him and get on again
with his life.''
   Johnson said he's trying to restore relationships with his sons
_ Aaron, 23; Anthony, 20; and Allen, 18 _ all in California after
losing touch with them.
   ``It's hard for me to pick up my relationships with them again
because I'll have to tell them what happened to me,'' he said.
``That's hard.''

   A Connecticut woman accused of storing arms in her
garden for leftist rebels returned to the United States on
Wednesday night after being freed from prison and deported from
war-ravaged El Salvador.
   ``I don't think I've suffered as terribly as thousands of
Salvadorans have suffered here,'' Jennifer Casolo, 28, said in El
Salvador before boarding a commercial flight to Miami 2{ weeks
after she was jailed on terrorism charges.
   Accompanied by U.S. Ambassador William Walker at Comalapa
International Airport, Casolo insisted on her innocence when she
was allowed to speak briefly with a few pool reporters.
   She said she signed a release statement acknowledging she was
arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of having stored weapons and
ammunition for rebels, but added, ``My position was always that I
was innocent.'' Casolo said she believed her release supports that
contention.
   She telephoned her parents in Thomaston, Conn., from the
airport. Walker said she told ``them she'll be home for
Christmas.'' He also said she had expressed the desire to return to
El Salvador someday.
   ``She sounded confident, her voice was loud and clear,'' said
her mother, Audrey Casolo, after talking with her daughter. ``She
sounded like a happy person. She said she loved me very much.''
   President Alfredo Cristiani said earlier there was not enough
evidence to continue holding Casolo.
   She was released into the custody of the ambassador, who picked
her up in a black Cadillac escorted by Jeeps on Wednesday at the
women's prison at Ilopango on the eastern outskirts of the capital.
   The caravan went to the airport and entered through a restricted
entrance. Reporters were not allowed access either at the prison or
airport.
   Casolo was put on an Eastern Airlines flight to Miami and
ushered to an undisclosed location upon her arrival, said the Rev.
Daniel Long, chairman of Christian Education Seminars, who traveled
with her on the plane.
   ``It was a very emotional time for her, being taken straight
from the prison to the airport and deported, because of her love
for the people and the country of El Salvador,'' Long said.
   She decided late Wednesday to remain in Florida and not return
immediately to her home in Connecticut, according to staffers for
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who has followed the case.
   Her travel plans beyond that were undecided, but church
officials at the Miami International Airport news conference said
Casolo planned to hold a news conference sometime Thursday.
   In Connecticut, friends and well-wishers in her hometown
prepared for her homecoming. Susan Abbott, a close high school
friend of Ms. Casolo's, put up a sign on the town green that said,
``Welcome Home, Jennifer. We Love You.''
   Cristiani told a news conference he thought Casolo probably had
cooperated with rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, who have fought U.S.-supported governments for 10 years and
launched a major urban offensive in San Salvador last month.
   ``I am morally convinced that Miss Casolo is guilty,'' he said.
The case against Casolo will proceed and she was asked to remain
available in case judicial authorities need to question her
further, Cristiani said.
   ``Evidence _ be it incriminating or exculpating _ will continue
to be gathered,'' the president said. ``If the evidence against her
becomes sufficient, she will be summoned to return for trial.''
   He acknowledged that little could be done to make her come back
to El Salvador.
   Casolo and two Salvadoran friends were arrested Nov. 26 in a
police raid on her house. She was charged with terrorism,
possessing weapons of war and criminal association, all of which
she denied. There was no immediate word on the cases against those
two Salvadorans.
   In the walled garden behind the house, police said, they dug up
103 mortar shells, 213 blocks of dynamite, 405 detonators, 150 feet
of slow-burning fuse and 21,945 rounds of ammunition for
Soviet-made automatic rifles.
   She said she did not know how the materiel got into the yard of
her rented home on the northwestern edge of San Salvador.
   Cristiani denied his rightist administration was pressured to
free Casolo by the United States, the key financial supporter of
his government.
   ``The judge's decision to release her is strictly judicial,'' he
said. ``It is a political decision that we have made to deport
her.''
   Judge Guillermo Romero of the criminal court handled the case.
   Cristiani said he spoke with Sen. Dodd, who telephoned several
times to ask about the case, but ``at no time did Sen. Dodd try to
exert pressure. Indeed, his position was that, if there was
sufficient proof against her, her trial should go forward.''
   Dodd said earlier Wednesday he was told in telephone
conversations with Salvadoran officials, including Cristiani, that
Casolo would be freed and expelled by Thursday afternoon.
   A statement issued by his office said Cristiani ``informs me
that the judge in her case has ultimately concluded the charges
against Jennifer were not fully supported by the evidence, and that
she could not thus be fairly prosecuted under Salvadoran law.''
   Casolo spent five years in El Salvador, working for Christian
Education Seminars, which organizes tours for Americans to learn
about the civil war.
   Salvador Ibarra, her defense lawyer, filed a writ Monday
requesting her release for lack of evidence. Cristiani said the
judge ruled favorably on the writ.
   Her last U.S. residence was in Seattle, and Rep. Jim McDermott,
D-Wash, said Wednesday: ``I am glad for Jennifer's sake that she
has been released because there were serious questions about the
ability of the Salvadoran judicial system to provide her a fair
trial.
   ``There are many individuals who do not have the benefit of so
many friends in America. Our relief at Jennifer's release must not
diminish our concern for the many other church workers she leaves
behind.''

   A Sikh wanted in connection
with a 1985 bombing that killed two baggage-handlers unloading a
Canadian jet at Narita Airport near Tokyo was extradited to Canada
on Wednesday.
   Inderjit Singh Reyat, 37, who worked in Canada as an auto
electrician before moving to Coventry, England, in 1986, appeared
briefly in Supreme Court in Vancouver after arriving on a flight
from London.
   Reyat was arrested in England in February 1988 and fought
extradition until the House of Lords, Britain's highest legal body,
refused to consider his appeal.
   He faces two charges of manslaughter and five counts of
possessing explosives.
   Evidence presented during his extradition battle indicated a
bomb exploded and killed two Japanese baggage handlers on June 23,
1985, as luggage was being unloaded at Narita from a Canadian
Pacific Air flight that had just arrived from Vancouver.
   The evidence indicated the suitcase bomb was to be transferred
to an Air India flight to Bangkok, Thailand, and Bombay, India.
   On the same day, an Air India flight from Toronto and Montreal
to Bombay via London blew apart off Ireland, killing all 329 people
on board.
   Sikh separatists have waged a campaign of violence against the
Indian government, demanding an independent homeland for their
religious minority.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Rule Out Marcos Liability in Wrongful-Death Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday refused to remove the
late Ferdinand Marcos from liability in a lawsuit that accuses him
of heading an anti-opposition network that led to the killings of
two political foes.
   The ruling meant closing arguments will go as scheduled Thursday
in the 3-week-old trial, which claims Silme Domingo and Gene
Viernes were fatally shot June 1, 1981, because their anti-Marcos
activities drew the attention of Marcos intelligence agents.
   The Marcoses' attorney, Richard Hibey, had asked U.S. District
Judge Barbara Rothstein to order a directed verdict in favor of
Marcos and his widow, Imelda, removing the case from the jury
hearing the case.
   Other defendants in the case had opted to have Rothstein judge
their liability.
   Dr. Leonilo Malabed, a Marcos friend who allegedly maintained a
slush fund that paid $15,000 for the murders, asked Rothstein to
dismiss him from the case, as did the Philippines government.
   Rothstein did not immediately rule on the motions for Imelda
Marcos, Malabed or the Philippines, Hibey said.
   Three men were convicted of the murders on the theory that
Domingo and Viernes were victims of an internal union dispute in
the Alaska Cannery Workers Union. Both were union officers.
   The two victim's survivors have brought the wrongful-death
lawsuit, which seeks $30 million in damages.
   Hibey and Malabed's attorney, Kate Alfieri, had asked Rothstein
to end the case against their clients on grounds that the
plaintiffs had failed to show any direct link between their clients
and the murders.
   George Greer, a local attorney for the Philippines government,
said he asked for dismissal under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities
Act. Under the act, government agents' actions must be within the
scope of their employment for the government to be liable, he said.
   The Philippines argues that Marcos' actions against his
opponents were done for his personal gain, Greer said, not on
behalf of the country from which he fled upon his overthrow in
February 1986.

   Less than a month after marching

overseeing contributions and poster campaigns for the opposition.
   The pro-democracy movement, which swiftly overturned 41 years of
Communist Party domination, now is frantically organizing for the
elections it had long demanded.
   Spilchal is an activist with Civic Forum, the main opposition
coalition, which is trying to gear up for elections without knowing
exactly how they will take shape or when they will occur.
   On Tuesday, it was unclear how a new president would be
selected. Under the constitution Parliament has until Dec. 23 to

   The Bush administration is considering lifting
a ban on satellite exports to China, continuing to chip away at
sanctions imposed on Beijing after its violent crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   President Bush ``did not intend to disrupt normal civilian
commercial relations'' when he barred military exports to China
last spring, and officials are reviewing the sanctions with that in
mind, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   The news from the White House brought condemnation from Rep. Sam
Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of House Foreign Policy subcommittee
on international economic policy and trade. He said the idea of
lifting the sanction on satellites ``makes no sense whatsoever.''
   ``In China, where the government has only tightened the screws,
the Bush administration seems to see no limit on what they ought to
try to do to help the Chinese government,'' Gejdenson said.

   The label ``degradable'' is surfacing on
plastic products from trash bags to diapers, but environmentalists
call it a marketing ploy that should be rejected.
   Six environmental groups called Tuesday for a boycott of all
degradable plastic products, contending there is no proof that the
products will decompose in a landfill any faster than conventional
plastics.
   ``Degradable plastics are a consumer ripoff,'' said Jeanne Wirka
of the Environmental Action Foundation, a Washington-based
environmental group.
   Richard Denison of the Environmental Defense Fund accused
manufacturers of ``preying on the environmental concerns of
American consumers'' to sell trash bags and other plastic items.

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday the

democratic reforms.
   ``We're certainly skeptical,'' Fitzwater said, speaking hours

<HEAD>Jill Clayburgh Fights Back in CBS Movie `Fear Stalk'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jill Clayburgh, as a strong-willed soap opera
producer, rashly decides to fight back when a psychopathic computer
hacker undermines her life in the CBS movie ``Fear Stalk.''
   Her character, Ally Maynard, shuns the advice of friends and
battles this dangerous man on his own terms.
   ``He steals her purse and belongings and gets the information he
needs to tap into her life through the computer,'' said Clayburgh.
``He takes her money, he victimizes her. Then, against advice, she
fights back. It escalates into a deadly competition. He's never
been challenged before.''
   ``Fear Stalk'' also stars Stephen Macht as her boyfriend and the
soap's director, and Sada Thompson as her mother. It will be
telecast Sunday.
   ``Ally has computers in her office and home,'' said Clayburgh.
``The scripts for the soap opera come in to her by computer. Ellen
Weston, who wrote the movie, worked in soaps while she put herself
through law school. She creates an interesting milieu. She creates
a sort of parallel between what's going on on the soap opera and
what's happening to me.''
   Early in her career, Clayburgh worked on the soap opera ``Search
For Tomorrow.''
   ``It's so hard to learn all those lines,'' she said. ``But for
my first six months I was in bed and communicated only by blinking
my eyes. I had been in an accident. When I finally came out of the
coma, I kept saying, `Oh, thank you, doctor. Thank you for saving
my life.' The cast and crew called me `Grateful Grace.'''
   She completed work on ``Search For Tomorrow'' at 12:30 p.m. and
had the rest of the day to appear in plays and audition for
commercials.
   Clayburgh made ``Fear Stalk'' on location in Los Angeles and was
preparing to return to her home north of New York City. She wanted
to get back in time to see daughter Lily, 7, perform in ``The
Nutcracker'' with the Stamford Ballet. Clayburgh is married to
playwright David Rabe and has a 4-year-old son, Michael, and a
17-year-old stepson, Jason.
   She has starred in such feature films as ``An Unmarried Woman,''
``Silver Streak,'' ``Starting Over,'' ``Luna,'' ``First Monday in
October,'' ``I'm Dancing As Fast As I Can,'' and ``Portnoy's
Complaint.''
   Her last film, ``Shy People'' in 1987, took her to Louisiana.
She played a photojournalist doing a story in the bayou country.
``It was incredibly difficult because we had to go in and out by
boat,'' she recalls. ``It was humid and the mosquitoes were
terrible. But I loved the people and the wonderful Cajun culture.''
   Lately, she's been working more in television. She has a movie
for ABC, ``Unspeakable Acts,'' based on a child abuse case. She
plays a psychologist who finds a way to interview the children
without influencing their testimony.
   Past TV movies include ``Hustling,'' ``Griffin and Phoenix: A
Love Story,'' ``Miles To Go'' and ``Who Gets the Friends.''
   ``I've been offered series but I've turned them down,'' she
said. ``I'm not ready yet to put in that much time away from the
kids. I am looking into a few comedy series for the future. I'm
very happy doing TV movies, however, and I may not do a series at
all.
   ``Doing a series is steady work and comedy is a lot of fun.
Comedy is something you don't get in a TV movie. Also, the idea of
working with an audience doing a series is very appealing.''

<HEAD>New `CBS This Morning' Producer Has Difficult Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Erik Sorenson recently became the second
executive producer ``CBS This Morning'' has had since its debut on
Nov. 30 two years ago. He has what some consider the morning
version of ``Mission Impossible.''
   Like its previous incarnations, the two-hour program remains a
distant third in ratings against NBC's ``Today'' and ABC's ``Good
Morning America.'' Like his precedessors on past and current CBS
morning shows, Sorenson is expected to change that.
   ``I don't think it's impossible,'' says Sorenson, 33, a former
vice president of CBS-owned KCBS-TV in Los Angeles. ``I think it's
tough, though.''
   That it is. Nielsen figures for last month's important ratings
sweeps _ local stations use the results to set advertising rates _
gave CBS' ``Morning'' a 2.5 ratings average, well behind the ABC
and NBC shows; they were tied with a 4.4. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.
   But the Nielsens contained a ray of hope for the CBS reveille
team of Harry Smith and Kathleen Sullivan. The ratings were up
two-tenths of a point from those of the previous November. Tiny,
yes, but a start.
   To improve on that, Sorenson, in the custom of new producers,
plans some changes: a different musical arrangement of the show's
theme music; more ratings-boosting travel, and what he calls ``more
visual variety.''
   No costly new set, a staple of arriving executive producers, is
planned by Sorenson, a Waukegan, Ill., native whose background is
in local news.
   But he is trying to get ``name'' contributors on various topics,
among them Chicago-based movie critic Gene Siskel, best known from
the syndicated ``Siskel &amp; Ebert`` film-review series.
   Others contributors, he says, would report on parenting,
science, the environment and aging.
   In addition to his plans to rely more heavily on CBS
correspondents, he has hired two new full-time staffers, features
reporter Wayne Freedman and Hollywood-based entertainment reporter
Steve Kmetko.
   And, in a move that got his show some publicity last week, he
hired CBS Sports reporter Greg Gumbel, the brother of ``Today''
co-host Bryant Gumbel, to do sports segments and occasional fill-in
anchoring on ``CBS This Morning.''
   But Sorenson doesn't think his show will get a swarm of
disaffected ``Today'' viewers next month when Jane Pauley, after 13
years on NBC's show, yields her co-host chair there to Deborah
Norville.
   ``Certainly Jane Pauley has a big following, and her departure
is undoubtedly going to cause some of her followers to look around
at what else is available,'' he says.
   But he theorizes that ``Good Morning America'' would be the
chief beneficiary of any ``Today'' viewer defection simply because
it has been on since 1975 and, like its NBC rival, is a place of
relative stability.
   CBS, in contrast, still is trying to get back morning viewers
who, after all the years of change, may have given up on it, he
says:
   ``I think a lot of viewers don't realize that CBS is a viable
alternative here. And so, I don't think we would stand to gain as
much from this (Pauley's exit) as perhaps GMA will. But I think we
certainly stand to gain.''
   Reassurances of stability in CBS' morning effort might help aid
its cause.
   No doubt for that reason, Sorenson has been downplaying
Sullivan's unusually frank comment last October on ``Donahue'' that
``my days are numbered'' if her show's ratings don't improve.
   Asked if she and Smith will continue as anchors all next year on
``CBS This Morning,'' Sorenson immediately replied, ``Yes.''
   He laughed when advised that constitutes a ringing endorsement
in network TV today. He also added qualifying comments. The anchor
team of Sullivan &amp; Smith will remain ``to the extent'' that he has
control of the situation.
   ``Obviously, there are forces and factors out there in the world
that could change that,'' he said. ``I suppose that if for some
reason, the show started bleeding ... and we started doing a 1.4
(rating) for 12 weeks in a row, somebody would have to say, `Wait a
minute, there's a mistake somewhere ...'
   ``But it's our intention to stay the course, stick with what
we've got, and improve on the program.''

<HEAD>Kenyan Woman Battles Plan for 60-Story Building in People's Park</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling political party's plan to put
up Africa's tallest building in a park set aside 26 years ago for
the common man stirred enough outrage in environmentalist Wangari
Maathai that she went to court to stop it.
   That raised the hackles of Parliament _ which held her action to
be tantamount to suing the head of state _ and the court eventually
threw the case out as lacking merit.
   But not before the issue raised a public outcry rarely seen in
Kenya. Officials found themselves accused of being irresponsible,
insensitive and unaccountable.
   Soon after independence from Britain in 1963, Kenya's first
president, Jomo Kenyatta, dedicated the 10-acre park on the edge of
Nairobi for the use of everyday Kenyans. He called it Uhuru _
Swahili for freedom.
   Today the park is an oasis that offers an inexpensive respite
for Nairobi's thousands of day laborers. Many of them, lacking
money for lunch, use the park for what sarcastically is known as an
``airburger'' _ a lunch-hour nap.
   After plans for the park were announced by the Kenya African
National Union, the nation's only legal political party, President
Daniel arap Moi allowed debate to go on for a little more than a
month. Then he assailed the building's critics as having ``insects
in their head'' and told them to ``shut up.''
   His order silenced most of the building's detracters.
   Not Mrs. Maathai. She went to court despite Parliament's threats
to have her Green Belt Movement tree-planting organization banned.
   The park has a processional, a pond with recreational row boats,
walkways and tiered levels for relaxing and picknicking; it
provides a getaway for the ``wananchi'' (common people) living in
the crowded neighborhoods and slums ringing the city.
   Scores of citizens in letters printed by Kenya's two independent
newspapers pleaded with the government to put the complex elsewhere.
   They, like Mrs. Maathai, have been dismissed as ignorant and
subversive by the government's most vocal stalwarts in a country
where views contrary to the official position are strongly
discouraged.
   In a letter to The Standard, Mrs. R. Mwangi wrote: ``I use the
park with my family most weekends. I see people there who have no
other forms of recreation, with their families, men with wives and
barefoot children but happy to have those moments of tranquility
when they can forget the struggle of daily living. ...
   ``Please have a care for the wananchi. We are already suffering
from other problems.''
   Kenya's leaders maintain the project will lend prestige to what
already is one of Africa's most developed and prosperous cities and
will provide thousands of needed jobs.
   Critics don't dispute these aspects of the project; they say
they just want the building moved to one of the other vast open
areas surrounding the city.
   The complex, which is expected to cost $197 million and take
about four years to complete, will include a 60-story main tower
with a four-story statue of President Moi in front, two 10-story
wings, an auditorium, parking for 2,000 people, and conference
facilities for 5,000 people, even though a conference center
already exists just a quarter of a mile from the proposed site.
   In a public statement, the Architectural Association of Kenya
protested putting the project in the park. It contended the
building will destroy the grassy belt on Nairobi's perimeter that
earned the metropolis the name ``Green City in the Sun.''
   Mrs. Maathai has earned the most vehement and vitriolic
condemnation from Parliament for her outspoken criticism of the
building, which has continued despite the president's directive for
people like her to shut up.
   Mrs. Maathai initially was reviled for her protests in letters
to individual members of Parliament, the British high commissioner
(ambassador) and the British media magnate Robert Maxwell, who owns
a share of the ruling party's media interests. She also called on
the people of Nairobi to ``stand up and raise their voices.''
   She drew even harsher rebukes for seeking a court injunction to
bar construction of the complex. Members of Parliament assailed her
12-year-old Green Belt Movement as bogus and subversive.
   On Dec. 11, the High Court dismissed her suit _ a ``non-starter
from the date of filing.''
   Mrs. Maathai, who before the ruling accused the court of being
more concerned with ``politics than law,'' said she was
disappointed in the decision but would appeal it to the attorney
general's office.
   ``The most important thing is to rise and express one's opinion
and say no when you should say no,'' she said. ``If we are not
listened to then at least we have done what we could do within our
own constraints.''

   The fingerprints of an old China hand are
showing.
   President Bush's overtures toward an unbending government in
Beijing are in line with the policy recommended by Richard M.
Nixon, who reopened the U.S. door to China 17 years ago. In person
and in memo, Nixon has urged Bush to keep it ajar despite the
deadly crackdown against democracy demonstrators, a Chinese hard
line that remains in force.
   Bush sent two senior administration officials to Beijing last
weekend, taking the first step toward repairing relations. He
defended the mission against a wave of Democratic criticism, and
some Republican skeptics, by saying that isolating China would only
make things worse.
   Nixon went to China six weeks ago, the first prominent American
visitor to confer with officials there since the government
clampdown that began with the massacre in Tiananmen Square on June
4. The former president then urged steps on both sides to improve
relations, and recommended exactly the kind of official mission
Bush then ordered.
   The people and the policy involved in the controversial gesture
to Beijing are testament to Nixon's role as a central figure in
U.S.-China relations for nearly two decades, a role that survived
his Watergate downfall.
   Directly or indirectly, Nixon has influenced China policy since
the era of pingpong diplomacy 20 years ago, prior to his
breakthrough presidential journey to China in 1972. In 1974, Nixon
appointed Bush to be U.S. representative to China.
   Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser and senior man
on the Beijing mission, was a deputy to Henry A. Kissinger when he
was national security adviser in the Nixon White House. Kissinger
went secretly to China to prepare for Nixon's 1972 trip. Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence S. Egleburger, the other half of the
Bush mission, also is a one-time Kissinger aide.
   Kissinger, the former secretary state, also visited Beijing this
fall, and returned saying that the Chinese should not be isolated.
   That was the administration theme as Bush and his spokesmen
defended the Scowcroft journey, while acknowledging that the
Chinese had done nothing to moderate their crackdown on dissenters.
Bush said the Chinese know they will have to address human rights
concerns to fully repair relations.
   ``But I don't want to see that China remains totally isolated,''
the president said Monday after Scowcroft returned and briefed him
on the weekend mission.
   ``...There has not been normalization of relations because Gen.
Scowcroft, at my request _ and it was my idea, my suggestion _ went
over there and had very high level talks in China,'' Bush said.
   But the Scowcroft visit included some of the trappings of normal
relations, including a state dinner and exchange of toasts with
typically flowery words about cooperation and friendship. The
Chinese apparently got to orchestrate the visit, the schedule and
the way it was announced, at 2 a.m. on a snowy Saturday in
Washington. ``The timing of the announcement was that the Chinese
asked that we not announce it until they arrived in China,'' said
White HousepPress secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   While the White House said Bush's economic and diplomatic
sanctions against the Chinese remain in place, they appear to have
been eased before the Scowcroft mission, with earlier top-level
contacts and with business dealings. ``The president suspended the
export of military weapons and defense articles to the People's
Republic of China, but did not intend to disrupt normal civilian
commercial relations,'' Fitzwater said. A suspension of
international development bank loans remains in effect.
   Scowcroft's assignment was said to be to brief Chinese leaders
on the Malta meetings between Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. He also was said to have expressed continuing U.S.
concern over the crackdown. But Fitzwater said the trip was not
prompted by Chinese concessions or internal changes.
   He said both Nixon and Kissinger had urged Bush to seek renewed
contacts with top Chinese officials. Nixon discussed his Beijing
visit with the president and his top advisers, including Scowcroft
and Eagleburger, at a White House dinner early in November. He also
gave Bush an 18-page written report on his meetings with Chinese
leaders and his views on the way relations might be improved.
   In a version he later made public, the former president said the
United States has a strong strategic interest in closer ties with
China, and suggested that the suspension of high level contacts had
even then served its purpose in venting U.S. outrage at the
Tiananmen crackdown.
   Isolation, Nixon said, would only strengthen reactionary forces
in China.
   ``...The administration should consider taking one step on its
own now, the resumption of contacts between high level
administration officials and Chinese officials,'' Nixon advised
Bush a month ago. ``Such an action should not require the Chinese
to act first...''
   That's what happened.
   Bush's Democratic critics, who deemed the original sanctions
inadequate, now accuse him of bending, wavering and kowtowing to
the Chinese. There are suggestions that they may vote for tougher
sanction laws next year.
   The political backlash over the Bush gesture will depend in
large part on what Beijing does now. ``The stickiest question is
who goes first,'' Nixon had said in his China memo.
   Bush did.

<HEAD>Workers Will Want More in 1990, Says Chamber</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Losing the fight to prevent an increase in the
minimum wage has left the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a somewhat
sullen mood about the immediate economic consequences.
   It will, the chamber says, result in the loss of hundreds of
thousands of job opportunities, ignite a new round of wage
inflation, raise the deficit, compromise U.S. competitiveness and
force some companies to forego expansion.
   The chamber was in the forefront of opposition to the increase,
which takes the hourly minimum to $4.25 from $3.35, and it still
smarts from the defeat, saying it resulted when ``sound economics
fell victim to political expediency.''
   More recently it expressed its ire in The Business Advocate, a
monthly newspaper delivered to members and opinion leaders, saying
the inrease will have a ripple effect on workers in higher-paying
jobs.
   ``When wages at one level increase, employees at higher levels
place a new and greater value on their services,'' said Bob Martin,
director of the chamber's Employee Relations Policy Center.
   He said numerous studies concur in his finding that the increase
will cost jobs. He cited one by the Congressional Budget Office
that indicated between 125,000 and 800,000 jobs would be lost if
the rate were raised to $4.55 as once proposed.
   Congress and the White House agreed, however, to a lesser
increase, bringing the minimum to $3.80 on April 1, 1990 and to
$4.25 one year later. It also permits a lower, short-term training
wage for some teenagers.
   Martin cites a 1981 report by the Minimum Wage Study Commission,
named by former President Carter, that found that each 10 percent
increase in the minimum wage has the potential to raise the
nation's payroll by 0.76 percent.
   Since the new law will raise the wage 27 percent, the Business
Advocate article concludes that labor costs will rise by about 2.05
percent, or more than $46 billion.
   Martin did express satisfaction that ``though we lost the last
battle, we saved businesses more than $9 billion by holding off a
wage increase for the past three years,'' and that it helped push
through a training wage.
   The latter, opposed by organized labor, will allow employers to
pay a lower minimum wage for three months to first-time workers
under age 20. The training wage of $3.35 would begin April 1, 1990,
rising to $3.61 a year later.
   While the minimum wage puts a base under minimum wages in much
of the nation, it is already exceeded in other areas, with some
food outlets already paying $6 an hour or even more for unskilled
workers.
   The chamber article didn't address another criticism of the
higher minimum, one made by William Dunkelberg, dean of Temple
University's business school, that the increases might not be as
effective as believed in reducing poverty levels.
   Dunkelberg testified during hearings held prior to the law's
signing on Nov. 17 that many earning the minimum are not primary
breadwinners in their families but instead are relatively
comfortable people earning second incomes.
   Regardless of who gets the minimum wage, and the automatic
increases that lift it over the next two years, the chamber said it
expects those earning above the minimum are likely, as a
consequence of the law, to want more.
   ``Expect wage pressure,'' it warned.

<HEAD>Town Torn Between Forgetting and Remembering Flight 103</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crater of Pan Am Flight 103, the
deepest, most visible scar on the town where it fell, is
disappearing under new homes.
   At the end of November, contractors began building 11 houses in
Sherwood Crescent where the falling wreckage of the Boeing 747
killed 11 residents of Lockerbie last Dec. 21, the final deaths of
a terrorist bombing that killed the 259 passengers and crew of
Flight 103.
   ``Some people needed an awful lot of sustaining just to get to
this week,'' said Malcolm McGeorge, who directs a team of social
workers in the town.
   ``The frustration that it has taken so long to rebuild has been
very great, crushing for some people. Others have little interest,
because they don't really want to go back, but feel they have to go
back because so much effort has been put in by so many people.''
   The crater has been filled and the street restored. Burnt shells
of houses have been pulled down, and only muddy vacant lots betray
the extent of the destruction.
   The construction reflects the determination to wipe out all
traces of the disaster. Along the sidewalk of Sherwood Crescent,
however, a lone pot of flowers testifies to a town torn between
remembrance and forgetting.
   Lockerbie lost its quiet obscurity just after 7:03 that cold
Wednesday night, when explosives hidden in a radio-cassette
recorder shattered the Pan Am jet ``Maid of the Seas.'' At 36
seconds past 7:03, the Eskdalemuir Observatory 15 miles from
Lockerbie recorded seismic shocks, apparently caused by the falling
wreckage.
   The main part of the fuselage, with enough jet fuel to push a
747 from Scotland to New York, exploded in Sherwood Crescent.
Shattered metal and flaming fuel spewed over dozens of houses, and
debris blocked traffic on the four-lane north-south highway.
   A forward portion of the fuselage landed across town in Rosebank
Crescent. The plane's nose fell 3 miles from town, across the road
from the stone church at Tundergarth.
   ``The night it happened, one of the first things I saw was the
body of a child hanging in a tree,'' said Ronnie Hall, who lives in
the Rosebank area. ``That child will never leave me.''
   The town's population of 3,500 nearly doubled with the influx of
a thousand police officers, 700 military personnel, 500 other
volunteer and support workers, and hundreds of reporters,
photographers and camera crews.
   Sheep now graze placidly where the plane's nose fell and the two
shattered houses in Rosebank Crescent have been rebuilt, but the
memories remain.
   ``When you think the number of houses (in Rosebank) that face in
that small area where 61 bodies were found ... there must be more
than a hundred people who could not avoid seeing that mayhem,''
McGeorge said.
   Sandy Pelling, assistant director of social work for the
Dumfries and Galloway Regional Council, recalled one family that
``identified with the young boy that was lying in their garden for
two days _ they started grieving for him, they wanted to know his
name.''
   Robert Hunter, whose home was 120 yards from the Sherwood
Crescent crater, brought his family back to the house two days
after the disaster. ``We wanted back in, to settle the kids if
nothing else,'' he said.
   Repairs put them out of the house for six weeks, however, and it
was 10 months before the job was complete. But they never thought
of moving, he said.
   Before talking with a reporter, Hunter shooed his daughters out
of the parlor. Talk of the disaster upsets them, he said, and with
the onset of winter he realized his older daughter, now 5, had
become afraid of the dark.
   ``We do talk about it with them on their own. They understand
what happened,'' he said.
   In the months after the disaster, some adults as well as
children had difficulty sleeping, McGeorge said.
   ``There were reports of children not sleeping or having
nightmares or playing what their parents thought were rather
bizarre, unsavory games _ playing airplanes and crashing them and
so on,'' he said. ``But that's definitely understandable, and
people were encouraged to understand that was OK, that it was a way
of dealing with it.''
   He said there have been no reports of children developing
serious behavioral problems.
   ``I think the people with the serious and lasting problems are
in the uniformed services ... just because of what they had to do
in the recovery of bodies,'' McGeorge said.
   The torn bodies reawakened some men's memories of combat
service, in one case going back to World War I, he said. For some
women, the disaster brought back moments of great personal loss _
of a husband, a child or parents.
   ``One of the things you hear people say is that they don't feel
safe anymore. If it happened once it can happen again,'' McGeorge
said. ``Some of them are quite unable to use public transport _
buses or trains. Airplanes are just out of the question.''
   McGeorge said some residents have admitted fearing the dark, or
the noise of a passing truck or express train. When one Lockerbie
man took a train to London, his wife kept the television on all day
expecting news of a rail disaster.
   Reflecting on the work in Lockerbie, Pelling talks about ``the
timelessness of disaster'' for survivors.
   ``It is there, it has happened, it is always going to be
there,'' he said. ``While they desperately want to get this episode
behind them and feel they are going forward, they are not going to
be able to shake off the night of the 21st in quite as easy terms.''
   Agencies that came to help are thinking now of leaving.
   ``I think we should melt away. We're another scar of the
disaster,'' said Alex McElroy, who directs the Community Support
office set up by the regional council.
   McElroy's office runs by two clocks, one set on U.S. Eastern
Standard Time because some of its contacts are with authorities and
insurors in the United States as well as with relatives of the
American victims.
   The approach of the anniversary made memories unavoidable. On
the afternoon of Dec. 21, the town will dedicate a monument in the
Dryfesdale Cemetery bearing the names of the 270 dead. A memorial
service will be held that night outside the town hall, used a year
ago as a temporary mortuary. Some American relatives of victims
plan to attend.
   ``We're hoping that after the 21st we can get back and have our
town to ourselves,'' said Valerie Moloney, who works with a
childrens' group formed after the disaster.
   Hugh Young, a member of the district council, agreed. ``I think
they see it as a watershed, a time for looking forward again. I
think people hope (the anniversary) will be an end to the media
attention.''

   The wrenching disaster of Pan Am
Flight 103 had an unexpected side effect for this small market town.
   The rebuilding effort has given residents the impetus to push
for some renewal projects.
   Beyond paying to rebuild destroyed homes and other essential
repairs, the local government has borrowed money to refurbish
dozens of units of public housing.
   Residents also pushed for better lights and street repairs, and
got them. And now they are pressing plans for a park on the site of
an abandoned factory.
   ``We just took a good look at ourselves and decided we were
being badly done by,'' said Ronnie Hall, vice chairman of a
residents committee in the Rosebank area.
   ``We're grasping the opportunity, because now the regional
council is very sympathetic to requests from Lockerbie,'' Hall
said. ``I think they are things we should have pushed for years
ago.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 12 months, police have doggedly sought the
bombers of Pan Am Flight 103 but said little officially about the
progress of their international manhunt.
   Here's what they have confirmed and what news reports have said
following the explosion and crash that killed all 259 people on the
plane and 11 on the ground last Dec. 21:
   _One week after the disaster, Britain's Department of Transport
confirmed a bomb blew up the Boeing 747 and said investigators had
found evidence of a powerful plastic explosive.
   _In February, Scottish police said the bomb was planted in a
Toshiba radio-cassette player and probably checked in as hold
baggage in Frankfurt, West Germany, where Flight 103 originated.
West German police had seized similar bombs in October 1988 and
arrested 16 members of a Palestinian group. All but two were soon
released, including Marwan Khreesat, who some people believe
assembled the bomb in Frankfurt.
   _News reports have frequently pointed to the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a radical Palestinian
group based in Syria, as the leading suspect. The group's leader,
Ahmed Jibril, repeatedly has denied involvement but has also
reportedly boasted he was paid by Iran to avenge the downing of an
Iranian airliner by a U.S. warship. Hafez Dalkamoni, one of
Jibril's top aides, is one of the two suspects still held in West
Germany.
   _Some news reports said the bomb was smuggled to Malta, checked
onto an Air Malta flight to Frankfurt and transferred to Pan Am
without an accompanying passenger. Others say the bomb began its
journey in Larnaca, Cyprus, in a suitcase switched with one
belonging to U.S. intelligence officers returning home after
looking for American hostages in Lebanon.
   _A court in Uppsala, Sweden, last month identified Mohammed Abu
Talb, a member of the Palestine Popular Struggle Front, another
radical faction, as a suspect in the Flight 103 bombing. Scottish
police were permitted to remove clothing from his Sweden apartment,
reportedly to compare with shreds of clothing found in the
wreckage. Abu Talb is awaiting verdicts, due Dec. 21, on charges of
murder and attempted murder in connection with four bombings in
northern Europe. Court documents show he was in Malta in October
1988.
   _U.S. Rep. James Traficant Jr. of Ohio released portions of a
report, said to have been prepared for Pan Am's insurance
underwriters, that alleges the terrorists got the bomb aboard the
plane through a CIA-protected drug smuggling ring at Frankfurt
airport. The CIA called the allegations nonsense.

<HEAD>Prescription Drug Abuse Down But Rules Hamper Some Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug enforcement officials are declaring a
partial victory in one battle of the war on drugs: the diversion of
prescription drugs to the illicit market.
   Cases of prescription drug abuse reported to the national Drug
Abuse Warning Network have fallen by almost one-third since 1981.
But some medical professionals say the tougher new rules are
preventing effective treatment of many Americans with legitimate
needs for such medication.
   In 1981, 131,618 incidents of pharmaceutical abuse were reported
to the warning network, but by 1988 that number had dropped to
88,525, said Gene Haislip of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   ``This is the one part of the drug problem where we have made
genuine progress and reduced the size of it,'' said Haislip, DEA's
diversion control chief.
   And yet, the diversion of legal drugs remains ``a very large
problem,'' he said.
   Most frequently abused are the narcotic painkillers Percodan,
Dilaudid and codeine; the stimulants amphetamine and Preludin, both
prescribed for short-term treatment of obesity; the sedative
Doriden; and tranquilizers such as Valium, Librium, Xanax and
Diazepam.
   The profit potential in diverted drugs is huge. A single 4
milligram tablet of Dilaudid costs a bonafide patient about 60
cents but can sell on the street for as much as $60, Haislip says.
   He estimates that up to 15 percent of the 25 billion
prescription pills and capsules manufactured legally each year wind
up on the street.
   The drugs reach the black market through several routes:
physicians who intentionally write unnecessary prescriptions,
patients who convince doctors that they need the drugs when they
don't, pharmacies that falsify records and thefts from drug stores.
   The authorities' biggest weapons in the battle against
diversions have been tighter regulation of physicians and
pharmacies and monitoring of prescriptions.
   Some observers contend the requirements have made life more
painful for patients with a legitimate need for frequently diverted
drugs.
   ``Physicians go out of their way to avoid attracting the
attention of regulatory agencies,'' write physicians C. Stratton
Hill Jr. and William S. Fields in a new book, ``Drug Treatment of
Cancer Pain in a Drug-Oriented Society.''
   ``As a result, they underprescribe the dosage of opiates and
fail to provide patients with prescriptions for drug quantities
sufficient to cover a reasonable time interval, thus making
frequent requests for resupply necessary,'' the doctors write.
``This prescribing behavior is humiliating for patients.''
   Take the case of a Texas minister highlighted in a documentary
film by Hill, who works at a Houston cancer center.
   The Baptist minister, suffering from cancer and seeking a
stronger painkiller from his doctor, was rebuffed as if he were an
addict.
   ``You're a dope head and I'm going to dry you out while you're
in here,'' the minister quoted his physician as saying.
   In an interview, Hill related the case of another patient who
was receiving a toxic dose of acetaminophen because his docotor was
prescribing it in combination with codeine rather than a stronger
medication _ simply to avoid the scrutiny that attends
prescriptions for the most frequently diverted painkillers.
   The DEA's Haislip said the federal regulation specifies that the
legitimate treatment of pain should not be impeded. He rejected
arguments that physicians are hesitant about prescribing necessary
drugs, noting that morphine prescriptions rose 300 percent from
1982 to 1986.
   ``That's an enormous increase, but the statistics do not show
any such comparable increase in diversion for that drug, which
leads me to believe that it is for cancer and most all of it is
legitimate,'' Haislip said.
   However, he acknowledged that some patients may have trouble
finding pharmacies willing to carry certain controlled drugs. A
recent nationwide survey found that only 38 percent of responding
drug stores routinely stock an oral morphine preparation, in many
cases because of fear of robbery.
   While some doctors shy away from prescribing the most potent
drugs, a few others have made an illegal living from it. Officials
cite the case of Dr. John Hall Thomas. He ran two weight-reduction
clinics in Texas and ``was writing about 45 percent of the
prescriptions for Preludin for the state of Texas'' when arrested
in 1982, said Wilbur Morris of the DEA in Dallas.
   Prosecutor Chris Harrison said at the time that investigators
sent undercover agent Allen Byrd, who is not overweight, to one
clinic to buy the stimulant.
   ``Thomas told him they would have to make it look legal, so Byrd
would have to bring four fat girls with him,'' Harrison said. ``He
came back with the girls, all law enforcement officers, and got the
prescriptions.''
   Thomas, originally indicted on 63 counts, pleaded guilty in a
plea bargain to one count of illegally prescribing the drug. He
lost his medical license and was sentenced to five years in prison,
Morris said.
   The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 tightened the
rules for those handling drugs with a potential for abuse. Such
drugs are broken down into five categories, or schedules:
   _Schedule I drugs, such as heroin, have the highest potential
for abuse but no accepted medical use and can be used only for
research.
   _Schedule II drugs are the most dangerous and subject to abuse.
This category includes Percodan, Dilaudid, morphine and some
codeine formulations as well as amphetamines and Preludin. Federal
regulations require that everyone who prescribes or handles
Schedule II drugs register with the DEA; that manufacturers,
distributors and pharmacies complete special DEA forms on every
transaction; that patients have a written prescription that cannot
be refilled; and that the drugs be kept in a safe by the
manufacturer, importer and distributor _ but not the pharmacy. The
DEA even sets production limits.
   _Schedule III, IV and V drugs pose a lesser danger and are
deemed less subject to abuse. Doriden is a Schedule III drug and
most tranquilizers are Schedule IV. Schedule V includes many
over-the-counter narcotic preparations. Federal regulations for the
Schedule III, IV and V drugs are increasingly lenient.
   Nine states have gone beyond federal rules, imposing a
multiple-copy prescription system, with most of the states
requiring the physician, the pharmacy and state officials to retain
a copy of each prescription.
   Officials of the states _ California, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan, New York, Rhode Island and Texas _ say such
programs enable them to spot those who seem to be prescribing or
dispensing inordinate amounts.
   All the state programs affect Schedule II drugs. Some include a
few Schedule III drugs, and New York, citing an alarming number of
prescriptions, recently added the Schedule IV sleeping pills and
tranquilizers such as Valium and Librium.
   Officials say Texas' multiple-copy program helped crack the case
of Dr. Thomas, although the long lines outside his clinics in
Dallas and Nacogdoches already had attracted law enforcement
attention.
   The White House Conference for a Drug Free America recommended
in June 1988 that all states establish such programs, and the DEA
supports them.
   The American Pharmaceutical Association, the American Medical
Association and some drug companies oppose the programs, citing
concerns about patient care, among others.
   Edwin Webb, the pharmaceutical association's professional
affairs director, said Schedule II prescriptions go down
dramatically as soon as such programs are instituted, and that can
hurt patients ``who truly do need large quantities of medication.''

   Dewey and Matilda Houck have seen the
drug war from the other side, fighting a sometimes futile battle to
obtain painkillers for a 5-year-old daughter being destroyed by
cancer.
   They raced to hospitals at all hours of the day and night to get
prescriptions for morphine that were good only for 48 hours,
searched the area for pharmacies that would risk the possibility of
a break-in to carry the drug, and tried to comfort their terrified
daughter when she asked the unanswerable question: ``Why does this
have to happen to me?''
   ``It is tragic enough to lose a child, but it's awful to live
with the terror of her agony,'' Matilda said in an interview at her
home in this Washington, D.C., suburb.
   Kendra Laurel Houck was born Oct. 28, 1983; she died March 3,
1989. A six-month failure by doctors to diagnose her neural
blastoma meant that when it was discovered in August 1986, the only
options left were experimental treatments. The doctors told the
Houcks their only child would have had a good chance of recovery
had the cancer been diagnosed earlier.
   Instead, for the next 2{ years, the family suffered through
experimental treatments, enjoyed a 10-month remission, doled out
dosages first of codeine and Demerol and later morphine, celebrated
Kendra's fifth birthday and learned all about the nation's drug
laws.
   Two days after Halloween 1988, Kendra's condition deteriorated
dramatically.
   ``From that day on, it became morphine ... and even that wasn't
real effective,'' said Dewey.
   ``She would be screaming on morphine,'' said Matilda, a gentle
woman whose voice wavered as she tried to restrain tears. ``It just
wasn't cutting the pain. She was conscious and in agony.''
   By the time Kendra died, her eyes pressed open day and night by
a brain tumor, she was taking more than 100 milligrams of morphine
every four hours.
   To Dewey, ``the real issue ... is access'' to morphine.
   The Houcks found that very few pharmacies carry the drug out of
fear of robberies; those that do generally have very little on hand
for the same reason. Dewey said pharmacies refused to tell him over
the phone whether they carried morphine because they feared a
holdup.
   The prescriptions were good only for 48 hours, which meant that
in times of need, they would race to Children's Hospital in
Washington to get one from the doctors who knew Kendra's condition.
But they could not get the morphine there because Kendra was at
home, not in the hospital.
   Eventually, they found a pharmacist who knew their situation and
would have the morphine ready when they needed it. He sold it to
them at cost.
   Even then, the price was $494 for a typical three-day supply,
Matilda said.
   ``I felt like the sick and dying are paying the price for our
drug war,'' she said.
   These are not radical, anti-establishment people. They did not
attempt illicit street buys of heroin for Kendra's pain _ something
experts say would not have helped her _ or marijuana for her nausea.
   ``That would have been an option to us had we chosen to do it in
an outlaw way,'' Dewey said, but it would have been ``100 percent
inconsistent'' with their lifestyle. In addition, he said, they
were concerned how Kendra's mix of drugs, had it included heroin or
marijuana, would have affected her.
   Merely handling the morphine seemed odd to Dewey.
   ``It was strange to fool with this stuff that was verboten,'' he
said. ``We had jugs full of it and we could not get enough'' for
Kendra.
   After Kendra died, the nurse immediately cleared out all the
leftover controlled substances, destroying them in the presence of
another health-care professional.
   ``I didn't understand why I couldn't just flush it down the
toilet with the Valium'' he said.

   The 1980s began in crisis: the crisis of the hostages, the

<HEAD>Lexus LS 400: Comfort, and Delicious Attention to Detail</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 Lexus LS 400 is a car drivers will want to live in.
   I did. The LS 400 test car had better soundproofing than my
apartment and an ambience several notches higher. It further beat
out my abode by coming equipped with an automatic compact disc
player, operating by remote control from the trunk.
   As a friend noted: ``This is a car that you wouldn't mind riding
in, even if you had a horrendous commute. In fact, you'd look
forward to it.''
   Such is the calming influence of the Lexus, the first of a new
breed of Japanese imports designed to lure buyers from such upscale
European luxury cars as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar.
   Early indications are that the LS 400, the larger of the two
Lexus models available, is a worthy competitor.
   ``Lexus transports you literally and figuratively into another
dimension,'' says Car and Driver magazine. ``The car's smoothness
and air of total integration is both a wonder and a delight.''
   Automobile magazine says, ``Another master stroke from the land
of the perfect machine.''
   Both magazines have named the LS 400 one of their top 10 autos
of the 1990 model year.
   What is so alluring about the LS 400? After all, on the outside,
this Toyota product is understated. The rounded front end resembles
that of a Mercedes.
   My first clue to the pampering offered by the LS 400 was the
electronic steering wheel that automatically tilts and telescopes
in or out to a pre-set position as the key fits into the ignition.
The steering wheel also contains an airbag.
   Then came the whisper-soft startup. For the first couple of
times, I needed to check the automatic lights on the test car's
dashboard to confirm the engine had started. On the road, the car
was equally quiet. Goodyear worked 18 months to develop a tire that
meets Toyota's rigid standards for that peaceful ride.
   I also admired the smooth shifting of the four-speed, automatic
overdrive transmission. I barely noticed as the powerful 32-valve,
V8 engine and well-tuned transmission went through their paces. And
the antilock brakes were the most sensitive I've encountered.
   Finally was the attention to detail.
   Front seats were wide and comfortable, with electronic controls
for personal adjustments. Even the headrests were electronic.
Toyota used a computer to study passengers' weight distribution so
the seat design would ease fatigue.
   The height of the seatbelt anchors also were electronically
adjustable, so shorter people don't have to tolerate chafing at the
neck; with the touch of a button, the belt could be lowered on the
door post.
   The power window buttons were well-designed, to accommodate even
long fingernails. Toyota had its engineers put on fake nails before
deciding the final design of the window buttons.
   The premium sound system, with the remote CD player in the
trunk, was superb. The changer holds six compact discs, selected
before the drive begins, and is operated from the dashboard panel.
   A convenient two-cup holder popped out from the center armrest,
and the spacious trunk contained a nifty first aid kit, complete
with travel case, and an auto repair kit.
   The LS 400 is larger and more popular than the other Lexus
model, the ES 250. Company spokeswoman Mindy Weiman said that of
the more than 9,000 Lexus vehicles sold since the line was
introduced in September, the majority are LS 400s.
   Target buyers are baby boomers entering their peak earning
years, she said, noting that the number of Americans aged 35 to 65
will grow from 78 million to 94 million into the next decade.
Household income of the Lexus buyers will be $50,000-plus, Weiman
said.
   Early Lexus sales showed the interest of import owners. Among
the first 1,000 buyers, 35 percent traded in European imports,
while 20 percent traded in Japanese models, Weiman said. Twenty
percent traded in domestic vehicles.
   In its competition with the European luxury cars, the Lexus has
an advantage in price and a disadvantage as the new kid on the
block.
   The LS 400 starts at $35,000, thousands less than the Mercedes
300E, at $39,950, and the lowest-priced Jaguar, the $39,700 XJ-6
four-door sedan. But Lexus doesn't have the years of name
recognition granted the BMW, Mercedes or Jaguar nameplates.
   That does not deter Toyota from predicting sales of 16,000 Lexus
cars this year, with sales next year set for 75,000.
   The LS 400 is a new vehicle, so Consumer Reports does not list
owner complaints. But in early December, Toyota recalled all 8,000
LS 400s to fix a sticky cruise control mechanism and replace a
defective stoplight cover that would melt if the light was left
burning.
   In addition, Lexus mechanics were also to make sure a connector
between the alternator and the battery was seated properly. If not
clicked into place, battery power could be drained, Lexus spokesman
Kurt Von Zumwalt said.

   It was a decade of Trivial Pursuits, harmonic convergences,
``spin control'' and being out of the loop: Nancy Reagan sat on Mr.
T's lap, Fawn Hall got a citation for eating a banana, Mount St.
Helens relocated its peak to the stratosphere, ``Ishtar'' fizzled
on the silver screen and ``Carrie'' flopped on Broadway. The E

<HEAD>Times Mirror Says Op Profit Rise Unlikely in 1989, NY Times Co. Has
Charge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weak advertising market for newspapers in the
Northeast is part of the reason for Times Mirror Inc.'s declaration
that it is unlikely to have higher operating earnings this year and
for a big charge against fourth quarter earnings at The New York
Times Co.
   Times Mirror executives told securities analysts on Tuesday that
higher circulation costs at its Los Angeles Times newspaper and a
settlement of a legal dispute also figured in its projection of a
possible decline in operating earnings for 1989. If operating
earnings decline, it would be the first such drop at Times Mirror
since 1982.
   Separately, The New York Times Co. announced a $44 million
charge against fourth quarter earnings, due to its investment in
its forest products operation and estimated costs related to
expected voluntary union staff cuts at The New York Times, its
flagship newspaper.
   The staff cuts, which are expected to involve mainly production
workers, were attributed to weak advertising volume in the New York
region and further automation of printing and production facilties.
   Analysts who follow the newspaper business have said they expect
ad revenue growth for newspapers to remain sluggish next year,
particularly in the Northeast where the economy appears weaker than
in other regions.
   Times Mirror, a media and information company based in Los
Angeles, owns the Los Angles Times and several Eastern newspapers,
including Newsday, New York Newsday, The Hartford Courant and the
Baltimore Sun newspapers.
   The company's earnings from operations were up 7 percent for the
first nine months of 1989 to $1.62 a share from $1.58 a share a
year earlier.
   But Robert F. Erburu, the company's chairman and chief
executive, told analysts at PaineWebber's 17th annual media
conference that it was was unlikely the company would ``continue to
show year-to-year improvement in operating earnings'' for the full
year.
   Erburu cited the difficult operating environment facing the
company's newspapers in the Northeast, the costs of trying to sign
up new subscribers after the Nov. 2 closing of the rival Los
Angeles Herald Examiner and a $5 million settlement of a legal case
involving Times Mirror's cable TV operations.
   David Laventhol, president of Times Mirror, said while the Los
Angeles Times was turning in a ``solid year'' with increases in
both retail and classified advertising, the company's Eastern
papers were reporting ad revenues barely even with a year ago, with
classified advertising lineage down 7 percent.
   For 1988, Times Mirror earned $331.9 million, or $2.58 a share,
on revenue of $3.33 billion. Operating earnings amounted to $2.27 a
share.
   Times Mirror said it has stepped up its cost-containment program
to offset some of the volatile economic and market conditions
expected next year.
   ``We have good reason to believe that we can show improvement in
1990 barring an economic downturn,'' Erburu said.
   In addition to newspapers and cable operations, Times Mirror
owns four television stations and publishes magazines and books.
   In a news release Tuesday, The New York Times Co. said 35 cents
of its 57 cent per share charge in the fourth quarter stemmed from
a determination that it would not fully recover an equity
investment in its forest products operation. The market for
newsprint has been glutted with supply.
   The remaining 22 cents per share of the charge stemmed from
estimated expenses of voluntary union staff reductions at The New
York Times. The company has been in talks with its printers and
plans to talk with other unions for production workers about staff
reductions, spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said.
   The reductions stem from weak advertising volume in the New York
region and automation of newspaper production in the composing
room, the planned closing of a printing facility at Carlstadt,
N.J., and the opening of an automated printing and distribution
facility in Edison, N.J., in late 1990.
   The company did not estimate earnings for the fourth quarter
ending Dec. 31.
   For the first nine months of 1989, the company earned $285.6
million, or $3.63 a share, on $1.30 billion in revenue.
   The New York Times is a diversified communications company that
publishes newspapers and magazines, operates television stations
and syndicates news and feature stories worldwide. It also owns
substantial interests in paper mills and has a stake in the
Paris-based International Herald Tribune.

<HEAD>Chevy Urges Dealers to Order More Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A General Motors Corp. bulletin sent to Chevrolet
dealers apparently turned into more orders for cars to be built in
January, a company spokesman says.
   The bulletin said dealer orders through Nov. 22 were far below
scheduled production and warned of plant shutdowns if the pace
didn't pick up.
   ``The bottom line is whatever signals we sent to the dealers in
late November clearly had an effect,'' said Chevrolet spokesman
Ralph Kramer.
   As of Tuesday, the 4,800 Chevrolet dealers had ordered about
75,000 cars from the January production of nearly 91,000, Kramer
said. That was up substantially from the 24,130 cars that dealers
had requested as of Nov. 22, he said.
   ``It is critical that all dealers immediately analyze their
product needs and submit orders immediately,'' said the bulletin,
quoted in a story in Monday's Automotive News trade journal.
``Adequate order banks are necessary to maintain uninterrupted
production.''
   ``There's no kidding about it,'' Kramer said. ``We're scratching
for every order we can get and our dealers are scratching for every
sale that they can get.''
   Frank Anderson, owner of Sir Walter Chevrolet-Geo in Raleigh,
N.C., said his business never received the bulletin. He said he has
been trimming orders for 1990 vehicles because of costs of keeping
them on hand.
   GM officials have contacted his dealership nearly daily ``giving
us the opportunity to order some more vehicles,'' Anderson said. He
has resisted large-scale orders, opting instead to keep his
inventory in the 45- to 50-day range.
   ``I think in their (GM's) selling, they couldn't hesitate to
mention the fact that there may be some plant closures in January
and February, even in some of the hotter lines,'' Anderson said.
``As we see it right now, that's their problem. Our immediate
problem is selling vehicles.''
   Chevrolet and Geo sales for the first 11 months of this year
were 1,262,158 cars, down 7.3 percent from the same period last
year.
   Last week, GM announced that some of its car- and truck-making
plants in Canada and the United States would close briefly in
January because of slumping dealer orders.
   Even before the 1990 model year got off to its official start on
Oct. 1, dealers were saying they planned to cut orders from
manufacturers by up to 30 percent.
   Ron Tonkin, president of the National Automobile Dealers
Association, has urged the 20,000 members of his organization to
cut orders even more to avoid costs of holding large inventories of
cars on their lots.

<HEAD>UAL Board Meets Against Backdrop Of Buyout Turmoil</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Takeover turmoil continued to cloud the future of
United Airlines as directors of parent UAL Corp. gathered for
today's regularly scheduled board meeting at the company's
Chicago-area headquarters.
   A new employee buyout plan that UAL's management drafted was
received cooly by leaders of United's pilots and flight attendants,
and ripped by the powerful Machinists union.
   Their response apparently has left Chairman Stephen Wolf without
a firm proposal for raising UAL's stock price and staving off
disgruntled investors.
   Opposition from the Machinists helped scuttle a $6.75 billion
pilot-management bid for the nation's second-largest airline in
October and their support is considered important to the success of
a revised offer.
   The Machinists represent about 25,000 of UAL's 70,000 workers.
   The plan floated by UAL management in meetings with employee
groups would value UAL at $240 a share, or $5.43 billion, the
Chicago Tribune reported Tuesday, quoting unidentified sources.
   The plan envisions UAL employees owning about two-thirds of the
stock and public stockholders about one-third, the Tribune said.
   UAL management would invest $30 million for a 2 percent stake in
the company and be granted options for another 6 percent, the
report said.
   ``If that's the deal, it's unacceptable. We will oppose it,''
said Brian Freeman, an adviser to the Machinists, in a telephone
interview from his Roseland, N.J., office.
   Freeman said UAL representatives had not met with the Machinists
regarding a revised buyout plan. He said the Machinists objected to
the price and other terms of the deal outlined in the Tribune but
he would not elaborate.
   UAL's stock climbed $2.75 to $176.75 in early New York Stock
Exchange trading.
   The Machinists' biggest complaint about the earlier,
$300-a-share UAL buyout plan was that it would require an
unacceptable level of borrowing. The deal, which had been approved
by UAL's board, failed when lenders backed away, citing the
Machinists' opposition.
   The failed bid would have given UAL workers 75 percent of the
company with management owning 10 percent and British Airways PLC,
15 percent.
   James Conley, a spokesman for the Machinists in Washington, said
the union also objected to any transaction involving UAL's two top
officers, Wolf and Executive Vice President John Pope.
   Representatives from UAL and from the United chapters of the Air
Line Pilots Association and the Association of Flight Attendants
declined comment on the Tribune report.
   UAL officials have said the pilots were given the proposal more
than a week ago. United pilots have not publicly stated their
opinion of the plan but their leader, Frederick Dubinsky, said last
week his union would not be rushed into a transaction.
   Patricia Friend, president of the United flight attendants'
union, said they were given the proposal last week and are still
studying it.
   UAL's board is under pressure from the investor group Coniston
Partners, which owns 11.8 percent of UAL's stock, to sell or
otherwise restructure the company to boost share prices.
   Keith Gollust, a general partner in Coniston, declined comment
Tuesday on whether the New York-based partnership would support the
reported buyout plan.
   Coniston has threatened to launch a drive for shareholder
consent to dump 13 of UAL's 15 directors and create a five-member
board.

<HEAD>Ramada Shareholders Approve Restructuring Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Approval of a corporate restructuring
plan by Ramada Inc. shareholders has cleared the way for the sale
of Ramada's 825 hotels and formation of a new company to operate
its Nevada and New Jersey casinos.
   The restructurng plan was approved Tuesday at a special
shareholders' meeting in Scottsdale. Under the plan, Ramada would
sell its international hotel business to New World Hotel Holdings
Ltd. of Hong Kong for $540 million.
   A new company, Aztar Corp., would be formed at the same time to
operate Ramada's three casinos.
   The transaction was approved by the Nevada and New Jersey gaming
commissions Tuesday.
   ``Assuming that everything goes as scheduled, we will close the
entire transaction next week,'' said Richard Snell, Ramada's
chairman and chief executive officer, after the meeting.
   More than 96 percent of the 30 million shares that were voted
approved the plan, under which each shareholder would receive $1 in
cash and one share of Aztar stock for each share of Ramada stock.
   Ramada's original restructuring plan, which the company scrapped
in October, included an offering of $400 million in debt
securities, including $230 million in subordinated debt, or ``junk
bonds,'' to finance the new company.
   Under that plan, shareholders would have received approximately
$7 plus one share of Aztar stock for each share of Ramada stock.
   The company announced in October that it would not go forward
with that plan because of ``unfavorable conditions'' in the
junk-bond market, which has been depressed and unstable for months.
   The new plan includes a $170 million offering of debt securities
and eliminates the junk-bond offering. Under the plan, each
shareholder would receive $1 in cash plus one share of Aztar stock
for each share of Ramada stock.
   Ramada spokesman Joe Cole said that under the new plan, Ramada
would assume $230 million less in new debt, but would pay out $240
million less to its stockholders.
   ``It will be a less leveraged, stronger company,'' Cole said.
   Fewer than 200 employees will lose their jobs once the
transaction is completed, Snell said.
   ``The main reduction is in the hotel group,'' he said.

   Purchasing managers of the nation's corporations
think the economy will avoid a recession next year but optimism has
ebbed to the lowest level since the early 1980s.
   The economy will be weak in the first half of 1990 and improve
during the remainder of the year, producing moderate growth
overall, the National Association of Purchasing Management said in
a forecast released Tuesday.
   Inflation will ease further next year and should finish this
year milder than previously expected, the report said.

   The Bush administration, striving to meet
deficit-reduction targets without a tax increase, is preparing to
base its upcoming budget on an optimistic forecast showing 1990
economic growth far higher than many private estimates,
administration sources said.
   The sources said Tuesday that the administration is expected to
forecast that the economy, as measured by the gross national

   The dollar fell today against all major foreign
currencies in nervous European trading, dealers said.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Dealers said they were flabbergasted by the dollar's tumble,
which went beyond all expectations and has left most year-end
trading strategies in shambles.
   ``There is a big uncertainty, people didn't expect that,'' said
a dealer at a Munich bank. ``The question is now whether there is
any interest by the central bank to support the dollar.''
   Dealers said they had not seen any central bank intervention
early today.
   The market was waiting for today's release of November U.S.
retail sales figures, traders said.
   Even if the sales figures were better than their modest
expectations, dealers said bearish sentiment on the dollar was
likely to persist at least until the end of the year.
   ``The only thing that could really help the dollar is a major
crisis in the East, like chaos in East Germany or if (Soviet leader
Mikhail) Gorbachev is toppled,'' said a Frankfurt trader.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.77 yen to a closing 143.70 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 143.80 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.7233 West German marks, down from 1.7335;
1.5650 Swiss francs, down from 1.5765; 5.8900 French francs, down
from 5.9275; 1.9410 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9715; 1,280.00
Italian lire, down from 1,285.75; and 1.1605 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1625.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6085 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6027 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $417.25 a troy ounce,
down from $417.50 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $417.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $416.80, up from $416.75 bid late
Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $1.08 to close at a bid $414.73.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.68 a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's $5.70.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed above
38,000 points for the first time today, while the dollar declined
against the Japanese yen for the second consecutive day.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shot up 258.89 points, or
0.68 percent, ending the day at 38,062.42, a new high.
   It took only 16 trading days for the index to gain more than
2,000 points. It first climbed above 36,000 points on Nov. 21.
   The Nikkei index's gain today was prompted by rises in the
futures market, said Yoshio Shimoyama, a senior dealer with Nikko
Securities Co.
   He said the Nikkei also rose on index-buying, or purchases of at
least 1,000 shares in all of the Nikkei's 225 items, transactions
that cost billions of dollars.
   ``Favorable economic factors, such as the yen's recent recovery
against the dollar and gains on overseas stock markets, reassured
participants and almost erased their worries,'' Shimoyama added.
   But some market players, especially institutional investors,
remained cautious, resulting in just moderate trading. First
section volume was estimated at 800 million shares, unchanged from
the previous day.
   Among gainers were high-tech, trading house and construction
issues.
   The dollar closed at 143.70 yen, down 0.77 yen from Tuesday's
144.47-yen close. It opened at 143.80 yen and ranged between 143.35
and 143.90 yen.
   The dollar, which had gained 1.75 yen in a seven-day rise, now
has lost 0.95 yen in the last two days.
   ``It was only the West German mark that moved actively,'' said
Yutaka Nakamura, a Daiwa Bank trader.
   ``Although some market players in Sydney and Tokyo sold the mark
for profit-taking, the mark weakened only temporarily and continued
to soar, especially against the dollar,'' he said.
   The dollar's weakness against the mark resulted in the yen
rising against the dollar, although dollar-yen trading was thin,
Nakamura said.
   Spot trading amounted to $8.42 billion, up from Tuesday's $3.87
billion.

   United Airlines, seeking to capitalize on the

   ``The demand for seats on United in both intra-Asian and
U.S.-Asian markets continues to be strong,'' United Chairman

   The expansion will have the greatest impact on routes between
major Asian cities, where United plans to boost capacity by 110
percent. Capacity between U.S. cities and various Asian
destinations other than Japan will grow by 88 percent.
   The airline said it will establish mini-hubs in Seoul and Taipei
for connections to Bangkok, Manila, Singapore, Shanghai and the
United States.
   It said the number of intra-Asian seats should more than double
to nearly 48,300 on a weekly basis by next August.
   Wolf said United plans to continue pursuing authority to
introduce service between Tokyo and Chicago in order to link its
largest U.S. hub with its Asian route network.
   United is competing with other carriers in seeking government
permission to fly the route.

<HEAD>Chrysler Not Building Subcompacts Until Mid-1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. will rely on a stripped-down
version of a compact car to fill a void left when the company stops
making subcompacts, a Chrysler executive said.
   The nation's No. 3 automaker will stop building its Dodge Omni
and Plymouth Horizon subcompacts when it shuts down its Jefferson
Avenue assembly plant in Detroit early in February.
   ``You'll see that low-end replaced by a value-oriented P-car,''
Chrysler marketing Vice President John Damoose said Tuesday.
   The P-car is the Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance built at the
company's Sterling Heights assembly plant.
   Damoose said the subcompact replacement probably wouldn't go
into production until after cars derived from the LH and LX
platforms are introduced, scheduled for the fall of 1992.
   According to Ward's Automotive Reports, a weekly industry
newsletter, subcompact cars made up 13.1 percent of the total U.S.
car market. The Omni and Horizon, the only subcompacts built by
Chrysler, comprised 8 percent of the automaker's car sales of about
959,128 through Nov. 30.
   Damoose spoke to reporters as he outlined Chrysler's plans for
the North American International Auto Show in Detroit next month.
At that event, Chrysler will show off its new Dodge Stealth sports
car, which goes on sale in October; the new Dodge Monaco, being
built in Canada; a LeBaron sedan, and a new Jeep.
   Damoose said Chrysler planned to build 25,000 to 30,000 Stealth
cars to compete in the same market as the Mazda RX-7 and the Nissan
300ZX. No price for the car has been set.
   Also, the company will have on hand six concept vehicles, which
are used to show off design and engineering developments but aren't
necessarily headed for assembly lines.
   On other matters, Damoose said:
   _Chrysler is studying the effect of Plymouth advertising
featuring entertainer Tina Turner, which was introduced earlier
this year. He said the research should be completed next month.
   He said he didn't know if the advertising had helped sell
Plymouth cars.
   ``Nobody has ever talked about Plymouth advertising in their
lives. Now they are,'' he said. So far this model year, Plymouth
dealers have sold 75,426 cars and minivans, down 4.7 percent from
the same time last year.
   _Chrysler production planners are forecasting that the company
will hold its 13.8 percent share of the U.S. car and light truck
market in 1990. That will come as sales for the entire industry
tumble to about 14.2 million vehicles.
   Chrysler's 1990 sales estimate is the lowest of the Big Three.
General Motors Corp. officials predict that about 15 million
vehicles will be sold next year and Ford Motor Co. executives put
the volume at about 14.7 million, slightly lower than sales this
year.
   ``Our strategy is to hold share and do it profitably,'' Damoose
said. ``Whether it's going to take any more incentives is anybody's
guess.''

<HEAD>Biotech Patent Suit Ruling Murky But Analysts Say Ultimately Positive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No clear winner was declared in the battle between
two companies over rights to an anemia treatment drug, but a
federal magistrate's murky ruling offered a potential boost to the
biotech industry, analysts said.
   Consumers could ultimately come out the winners under the
federal ruling because the two companies could reach a
cross-licensing agreement that would ensure a stable and perhaps
cheaper supply of the drug, analysts said Tuesday.
   The case began two years ago when Amgen Inc. sued Genetics
Institute Inc. for allegedly infringing on the biotech company's
patent covering the production of erythropoietin, or EPO.
   Genetics Institute countersued, claiming it held the rights to
the protein itself, which stimulates the production of red blood
cells and is often used to treat kidney disease.
   U.S. Magistrate Patti B. Saris issued a 184-page ruling Monday
in which she found both patents to be mostly valid, meaning that
each company had infringed on the other's patent rights.
   ``The greatest likely impact is greatly enhanced chances for
negotiations leading to a settlement, which would involve
cross-licensing for both parties,'' said David Webber, a biotech
stock analyst with Alex. Brown &amp; Sons in New York.
   Both parties may file an appeal in the case, but analysts said
the protracted battle would likely end in a compromise that would
allow Amgen, which has already secured Food and Drug Administration
approval, to continue marketing EPO in the United States.
   For GI, cross-licensing would mean the company could use the
Amgen-patented process to manufacture EPO domestically, where the
estimated potential market for the drug is at least $200 million.
   Webber said Monday's ruling left a ``plethora of potential legal
outcomes, but there is increased incentive for Amgen to negotiate
on an even-handed basis with GI because there's an increased chance
that Amgen could lose its right to market EPO in the United
States.''
   Lawyers for both companies said they had not yet decided what
their next step would be, but none ruled out the possibility of a
compromise.
   ``In my mind it's somewhat of a common-sense type of thing,''
said Eugene Moroz, whose firm represents GI's Japanese partner,
Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. ``But that's assuming you can get two
fighting parties together after a long battle.''
   Mark Brand, a spokesman for Amgen, said only that the company
was examining ``all the options'' and would not rush a decision on
whether to appeal the ruling.
   Genetics Institute was awarded a patent for the substance EPO in
June 1987, but the scientist who purified the EPO described in the
patent application used conventional chemistry to create it
   Amgen got a patent the following October for identifying the EP
gene and for creating genetically engineered cells that contain and
produce it.
   In effect, the only commercially viable way to produce Genetics
Institute's patented EPO is by using Amgen's patented process.
   ``What we have here is two patents and two infringers,'' said
Linda Miller, an analyst with PaineWebber Group Inc. in Boston.
``It's sort of a ping-pong match going back and forth and back and
forth.''
   Gary Hatton, editor of Biotech Stock Letter in Waltham, Mass.
said cross-licensing could benefit consumers by bringing both
companies into the market, thus stabilizing sources of the supply,
and also potentially undercutting prices.
   ``Because Chugai is behind in the actual marketing of the drug,
they may come in at sort of a price discount, so you get some
competition,'' he said.
   Webber said the ruling was also significant in that it upheld
patents in the relatively untried biotechnology field.
   ``It's one of the first federal court rulings regarding
genetically-engineered proteins used as therapeutic drugs,'' he
said. ``There's been a lot of uncertainty where ownership as
indicated by patents would end up in this field.''
   Hatton agreed.
   ``It's a tremendously important suit ... for the biotech
industry because before any venture capitalist puts money into the
industry he has to believe these products are going to get
patents,'' he said. ``It reduces a huge uncertainty and the effect
is an increased stability.''

<HEAD>Hanover Picks New President From Chemical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical Banking Corp. President Thomas S.
Johnson has been named the new president and apparent heir to the
chairmanship of rival Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
   Johnson's appointment, which becomes final at a board of
directors meeting Tuesday, comes as Manufacturers struggles through
a major restructuring resulting from problems with its portfolio of
loans to Third World countries.
   Analysts have said that Manufacturers needed new blood in its
management team, as well as a successor for John F. McGillicuddy,
59, who has been chairman and president of the bank for nearly two
decades and says he plans to retire in a few years.
   In a statement Tuesday, McGillicuddy said, ``We look to Tom
(Johnson) as my successor. He is an outstanding individual, a
proven leader and a talented executive with a wide range of
experience in financial services.''
   At Chemical Bank, Johnson, 49, was the second-highest ranking
officer since 1983, heading all corporate and institutional
business, including commercial banking and corporate finance. He
faced a longer wait there before taking the reins from Chairman
Walter V. Shipley, who is in his early 50s.
   Prior to joining Chemical in 1969, Johnson served as a special
assistant to the comptroller in the Defense Department.
   McGillicuddy said Johnson's initial main role at Manufacturers
would be to complete the reorganization of its global wholesale
bank.
   Manufacturers posted a $789 million loss in the third quarter
after adding $950 million to its reserve against possible losses on
loans to developing countries.
   As part of its restructuring, Manufacturers also has sold a
controlling stake of its CIT Group financial services unit to
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. of Japan, issued new shares and made
cutbacks in staff.

<HEAD>Du Pont, Waste Management to Build Plastic Recycling Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $5 million plant to recycle plastics now
mostly buried in landfills will open here in the spring in a joint
venture between Du Pont Co. and Waste Management of North America
Inc.
   Known as the Plastic Recycling Alliance, the 50-50 venture would
demonstrate, first, the companies' commitment to recycling and,
second, that household plastics collected at curbside can have a
new life, officials of the two firms said Tuesday.
   They said they plan to build the concept into an environmentally
safe, nationwide trash disposal network.
   Nicholas Pappas, Du Pont executive vice president, and Waste
Management President William Hulligan said the 70-employee plant is
the first that completes the recycling loop _ from picking up trash
to turning it into new products like baseball gloves, park benches
and home siding.
   ``Our plant is a very clean process,'' Pappas said. ``It doesn't
affect the environment at all.''
   Other firms operate similar plastic recovery plants, notably in
South Carolina and New Jersey, but none is involved in trash
collection.
   If the plant succeeds as expected _ handling up to 40 million
pounds of residential-generated plastic annually the first few
years _ another facility will open later next year in the Midwest
at a site to be selected.
   ``Future recycling facilities will be located in areas where the
joint venture can purchase materials from curbside and deposit
return programs throughout the United States,'' Pappas said, noting
that Waste Management is the largest collector of trash in the
world while Du Pont is one of the largest plastic makers.
   The two executives said the joint venture will have a total
capacity of 200 million pounds from various trash sources by 1994.
   Du Pont is headquartered in Wilmington, Del., and Waste
Management has its base in Oak Brook, Ill.
   Pappas envisioned a minimum of three plants. If enough new
product is produced in what he called an infant industry the
venture might sell to other companies besides Du Pont, which has
been recycling industrial plastics for about a decade.
   ``After the plastic materials are delivered, the venture sorts,
cleans and reduces them to plastic flake, a usable raw material for
processing by Du Pont,'' Pappas said.
   ``Du Pont's requirement for raw materials for use in attractive
new products assures the joint venture of a market and it assures
Du Pont of a steady and reliable source of feedstock,'' Hulligan
said.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode, praising the site selection, said
Philadelphia today spends almost $65 million for solid waste
disposal. A sound trash recycling program for which there is a
market can save the city money, he said.

   Energy issues set the pace as the stock market
advanced slightly today, extending Tuesday's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.99 to 2,755.12 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 517 up, 421 down and
575 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 26.56 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Among the energy stocks, Unocal rose { to 31[; Exxon [ to 51];
Texaco \ to 57]; Phillips Petroleum { to 26], and Halliburton { to
43~.
   The group has attracted increasing attention of late on news of
colder-than-usual weather in much of the United States and
forecasts of higher world oil prices in the early 1990s.
   Otherwise, analysts said traders drew some encouragement from
the Commerce Department report that retail sales rose 0.8 percent
in November, exceeding advance estimates.
   But investors still seemed to be cautious about the outlook for
the economy in 1990 and the prospect that corporate profits might
remain weak.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .14 to 194.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .46 at 377.87.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 23.89 to
2,752.13.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 3 to 2 on
the NYSE, with 889 up, 639 down and 481 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 176.82 million shares, against 147.13
million in the previous session.

   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade shrank to $22.69 billion in the July-September quarter,
giving the country its lowest trade imbalance since early 1984, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the current account deficit dropped
a dramatic 29 percent from a second-quarter deficit of $32.08
billion as the category covering income on U.S. investments abroard
surged upward.
   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only
trade in merchandise but trade in services. The latter category
includes the income Americans earn on their overseas investments
and the income foreigners earn on their investments in the United
States.
   For the third quarter, the services category registered a
surplus of $8.72 billion, reflecting a decline in the value of the
dollar during the period. A weaker dollar means that the profits
U.S. companies earn in foreign currencies are worth more when they
are translated back into dollars.
   A rising dollar during the April-June quarter was blamed for
depressing investment earnings in the second quarter, when the
country registered a $1.66 billion deficit in the services
category. That was the first services deficit in 30 years.
   Private economists, however, cautioned that the big swing of the
services category back into surplus was likely to be only
temporary. Many analysts forecast that the services category will
be in deficit throughout the 1990s, reflecting the fact that the
United States is now the world's largest debtor nation.
   Simply put, that means that foreigners now own more in U.S.
assets than Americans own overseas. America's net debtor position
stood at $532.5 billion at the end of last year and is expected to
worsen by an additional $100 billion this year.
   Many economists are predicting that U.S. living standards will
begin to decline because financing the growing foreign debt burden
will mean that less money will be available for productive
investment in this country.
   Through the first nine months of this year, the current account
deficit was running at an annual rate of $113.55 billion, down
modestly from the $126.55 billion deficit recorded in 1988.
   The $22.69 billion deficit in the third quarter was the lowest
since a $20.9 billion imbalance in the first quarter of 1984.
   It occurred even though the merchandise deficit rose a slight
0.7 percent during the quarter to $27.75 billion, up from $27.55
billion in the second quarter.
   In addition to merchandise and services, the third segment of
the current account deficit, U.S. foreign aid payments and pensions
to Americans living overseas, rose in the third quarter to $3.66
billion, up from $2.87 billion in the second quarter.
   The current account reflects the sum of the deficits or
surpluses in the merchandise, services and foreign aid and pensions
categories.
   At the start of this decade, the United States was running
surpluses in its current account because earnings from American
investments abroad were enough to offset perennial deficits in
merchandise trade.
   But as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign
hands to pay for imported cars and televisions, the investment
cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985, when the
United States became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.

   A recent meeting between Eastern Airlines and
its striking Machinists union has prompted a federal bankruptcy
judge to postpone until Jan. 26 consideration of contempt charges
against union leaders.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland on Tuesday granted the
union's request that the hearing be deferred. The potential
contempt charges stem from a disturbance Nov. 26 between pickets
and working employees at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
   Sheldon Engelhard, an attorney representing the Machinists, said
the hearing should be put off because of recent negotiations
between union leaders and management.
   Charles E. Bryan, president of Machinists District 100, told The
Associated Press last week that he met in Washington on Nov. 30
with Eastern vice presidents Tom Matthews and Al Gibson. The
three-hour meeting was led by federal mediator Harry Bickford.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said it was the first such
meeting since an informal session Oct. 13, and he and Bryan said
both sides agreed to more meetings. Bryan said all parties agreed
not to describe or give details of the sessions.
   In a separate development Tuesday, Eastern and a committee
representing major creditors agreed to postpone until sometime next
week a meeting that had been planned for Wednesday, Matell said.
   Eastern reportedly is close to selling its Latin American routes
to AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, for $300 million to $400
million. There has been speculation that a deal would be announced
at the meeting with creditors.
   Miami-based Eastern has been operating as a smaller airline with
replacement workers since March 4, when the Machinists struck and
pilots and flight attendants walked out in sympathy. Eastern filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 9; the carrier is
expected to submit a revised plan of reorganization at next week's
session with creditors.
   The Machinists continue to walk picket lines, but the pilots and
flight attendants called off their sympathy strikes shortly before
Thanksgiving.
   Seven striking Machinists were arrested Nov. 26 on charges of
unlawful assembly when they refused to leave the Atlanta airport
after a group of pickets pelted cars with rocks and injured a
working Eastern employee.
   At that time, Lifland issued a show-cause order citing ``willful
defiance'' of a July 17 temporary restraining order prohibiting the
Atlanta pickets from threatening or injuring Eastern workers.
   The Machinists cited in the order could face fines and court
costs if found in contempt. They include Bryan and Robert Taylor
and Charles Pecca, Machinist officials based in Atlanta.

<HEAD>British Airways, KLM Buy 20 Percent Stakes in Sabena</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
each plan to buy a 20 percent stake in a newly formed Sabena World
Airways for a combined total of $110 million, the British airline
announced Wednesday.
   The other 60 percent of the new airline will be held by parent
company Sabena SA, which is controlled by the Belgian government,
British Airways said.
   The new airline, formed after nearly six months of negotiations,
is scheduled to start operations at the beginning of next year,
extending Sabena's present route network with a ``hub and spoke''
system centered on Brussels' Zaventem Airport, British Airways said.
   British Airways' stake cost 34 million pounds, the equivalent of
$55 million, while KLM confirmed that its stake cost 107 million
Dutch guilders, also equal to about $55 million.
   The British carrier said the new Sabena airline is expected to
exploit opportunities emerging from the progressive liberalization
of European air transportation.
   This will include intercontinental routes such as linking
Brussels with Manchester in Britain for some services to North
America and the Far East and linking Brussels with Amsterdam for
some services to Africa and South America, it said.
   In terms of revenue passenger kilometers, the new company is
expected to treble Sabena's current size in six years, British
Airways said.
   Last year, Sabena reported 1.2 billion revenue passenger
kilometers, ranking it 16th among European airlines, according to
the Association of European Airlines.
   British Airways ranked first, and KLM ninth by that measure,
which is the number of kilometers airlines fly fare-paying
passengers.
   The board of Sabena World will have 10 members with six coming
from Sabena and two from each British Airways and KLM. Sabena's
chairman will be Carlos van Rafelghem, who is currently chairman
and chief executive of Sabena SA.
   European airlines have been scrambling to buy into other
airlines and form joint ventures to become better competitors in
the face of increasing deregulation and globalization of the travel
industry.
   British Airways attempted to buy a 15 percent stake in United
Airlines of the United States earlier this year, but abandoned the
effort after the management bidding group encountered difficulties
lining up the financing.
   This forging of ties has raised concern in some quarters that
Europe's airlines eventually will be concentrated into two or three
blocks, which could hurt competition, and ultimately the consumer.
   A spokesman for the European Community Commission, who requested
anonymity, said the governing body of the 12-member Common Market
would examine the new venture agreement to see whether it is
anti-competitive.
   The commission ordered British Airways to change terms of its
acquisition of its smaller rival British Caledonian Airways two
years ago.
   British Airways said about the latest deal: ``The three airline
partners will remain autonomous and continue to compete
commercially.''
   It said it already competes directly with Sabena on two routes,
London to Brussels and Amsterdam, and that the competition will
intensify.

<HEAD>Agencies Cite Reports of Rudder Control Problems on 737s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen reports of problems with rudder
trim controls on Boeing 737s have been made since a plane skidded
off a New York runway in September, two federal agencies
investigating the accident said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday they have asked Boeing Co.
to provide data on any reports it has received on rudders set in
unexpected positions on its 737-300 and 737-400 model jets.
   Boeing spokesman Dick Schleh said the jet manufacturer is
compiling the data.
   Schleh said it is not clear whether the federal request is
connected with the New York incident. ``This is just part of the
information the NTSB accumulates in the normal course of an
investigation like this,'' he said.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz in Washington, D.C., said the
agency has received at least a dozen reports, including two
involving foreign airlines, of instances ``where the crew says it
discovered the rudder was trimmed in a way that they didn't
expect.''
   The board began receiving the reports after its investigators
found that the rudder was improperly set on USAir Flight 5050 as it
tried to take off from New York's LaGuardia Airport on Sept. 20.
   Two passengers were killed and 45 injured when the 737-400
veered during takeoff and skidded into the East River, breaking
into three pieces.
   The board will decide later this week whether it will hold
public hearings on the accident, Lopatkiewicz said.
   FAA spokesman David Duff in Seattle said his agency has launched
its own investigation after receiving several reports of rudder
trim problems.
   The FAA expects to receive further information from Boeing next
week and then will decide whether to order any action, such as a
design change or modification, Duff said.
   The inquiries are limited to the 737-300 and 737-400 models
because they have electrically driven trim activators. Earlier
737-100 and 737-200 models have manual cranks.
   ``The FAA has looked into the incidents to try to determine if
the cause was related to human factors or a mechanical problem or a
combination of both,'' Duff said.
   The investigations will include whether a crew member
inadvertently activated the rudder trim switch and an examination
of the cockpit gauge that indicates how the rudder is trimmed.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with
wheat and soybeans mostly lower and corn mostly higher.
   The slight drop in soybean values largely reflected weakening in
the soybean meal and oil markets and expectations for continued
slow export demand, analysts said.
   Contracts for soybean deliveries next fall gained slightly,
though, on reports of severe dryness in southern Brazil, the
world's second-largest soybean producer.
   Wheat was down slightly amid perceptions of slackening demand
and ideas the market was due for a downward correction after its
recent gains. The Agriculture Deparment's rejection of several bids
for export wheat also weighed on futures.
   Corn futures were mostly higher in line with the cash market,
following Tuesday's USDA announcement that the Soviet Union had
bought about 100,000 metric tons of U.S corn.
   Sharply lower precious metal prices contributed to the markets'
overall bearish cast, said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research
Department Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 1{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.12 a bushel; corn
was { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.34\ a
bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent higher with March at $1.56{ a
bushel; soybeans were \ cent lower to 2{ cents higher with January

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .05 cent to .17 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in December at 76.70 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were unchanged to .15 cent higher with January at 83.37
cents a pound; live hogs were .45 cent lower to .03 cent higher
with December at 50.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .43
cent to 1.15 cents higher with February at 51 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled narrowly mixed on Tuesday.

   The season is in full swing when charitable
organizations form a sort of joint venture with Santa Claus and
Uncle Sam, filling mail boxes, telephone lines and shopping malls
with requests for contributions.
   The fund raisers expect results from those extra efforts because
they carry a double-edged appeal _ the emotional spirit of the
holidays, and the pragmatic allure of a last-minute tax deduction.
   Some people object to this merger of generous and selfish
motives. But from a practical standpoint, financial advisers say, a
knowledge of the tax rules can make a big difference in how
effectively you devote your limited resources to religious or
community service groups, private education, or any other cause you
consider worthy.
   First of all, the experts point out, you can't take any writeoff
these days for charitable contributions unless you itemize
deductions.
   That's important to consider, because the standard deduction has
been sharply increased in the last few years. For 1989, it is
$3,100 for a single taxpayer and $5,200 for a married couple filing
a joint return.
   Contributions won't provide you with any extra tax saving if
they and your other deductions, such as mortgage interest, don't
add up to more than those amounts.
   Tax specialists advise people on the borderline to consider
bunching deductible expenses such as contributions into alternate
years and itemizing only in those years.
   There are strict rules as well covering just what contributions
are deductible. Money given to a recognized church or charity, for
instance, is almost surely eligible for a writeoff; country club
dues almost surely not.
   ``An organization can (and undoubtedly will) tell you whether
your contribution to it is tax deductible,'' says the accounting
firm of Price Waterhouse in its annual Personal Tax Advisor.
   Gifts to individuals, or designated for an individual's use, are
excluded by the rules. Also excluded are contributions to business
or civic leagues and political parties or candidates.
   On the other hand, an eligible cash contribution is deductible
in the year in which it is made, even if you use borrowed money.
That means that you can give by credit card in December, pay the
credit-card bill later and still take a deduction for 1989.
   Many organizations also readily accept non-cash gifts, such as
old and outgrown clothing or furniture.
   ``Specific records must be kept to support a deduction for
donated property,'' observe accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche. Once the
amount you claim in this category surpasses $500 in any year, the
documentation requirements grow increasingly stringent.
   Some special incentives exist to donate stocks or other
securities that you have owned for more than a year and have
appreciated in value since you bought them.
   Under most circumstances, you can take a deduction for the
present value of such a contribution _ and avoid paying taxes on
the capital gain that occurred while you owned the asset in
question.
   Much different advice applies in the case of securities that are
worth less now than when you bought them, since giving them
directly involves passing up a deductible tax loss.
   Such property ``should not be contributed to a charity,'' says
Deloitte &amp; Touche. ``It should be sold to realize the loss, and the
proceeds of the sale should be contributed to charity.''

   Northeast Utilities made major gains today
in its bid to buy Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the
first big investor-owned utility to go bankrupt since the
Depression.
   State Senate President William Bartlett, whose support was seen
as key to Northeast's success in a special legislative session
scheduled for Thursday, now will support the $2.3 billion buyout.
   And Public Service _ which had held out hope of winning the
right to reorganize itself _ threw in the towel.
   House Speaker Douglas Scamman announced at a news conference
that Republican leaders in both houses had united behind the
Northeast plan after winning agreements intended to protect
consumers and other New Hampshire utilities.
   ``We're very confident they have protection and future (power)
supply'' based on the agreements,'' Scamman said. The changes will
be amendments to the Northeast takeover bill scheduled for a vote
Thursday.
   Despite the developments, the vote still is too close to call,
the No. 2 Republican in the Senate said.
   ``I won't make any prediction,'' Majority Leader Edward Dupont
said. He said he hadn't decided how he would vote.
   Democrats, heavily outnumbered in the Legislature, continued to
oppose the Northeast plan.
   ``We have come to no agreement,'' House Democratic Leader Mary
Chambers said this morning.
   Connecticut-based Northeast proposes seven annual rate increases
of 5.5 percent, the first taking effect Jan. 1. Northeast says the
plan is ``Seabrook neutral,'' meaning it would not change
regardless of whether Public Service's Seabrook nuclear power plant
operates.
   The $6.3 billion plant, which plunged Public Service into
bankruptcy reorganization in January 1988, is idle for lack of a
federal operating license. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission could
issue a license as early as January, but appeals in federal courts
are certain.
   Public Service, New Hampshire's largest electric utility, had
been viewed recently as a distant second in the takeover
competition. At a morning news conference, John Duffett, president
and board chairman, attributed the utility's decision to drop out
of the competition mainly to political opposition and Public
Service's inability to win support from key creditor groups.
   Northeast, far and away the leading contender before today, had
been seen as having little chance of winning legislative backing
without support from Bartlett. As late as Tuesday night, Bartlett
continued negotiating for further concessions from Northeast.
   Legislative Democrats, and some Republicans, say the Northeast
plan would be a windfall for investors without protecting consumers.
   Republican Gov. Judd Gregg and other supporters of the agreement
say the plan is far from ideal, but is the best that could be
achieved under difficult circumstances _ and has the important
benefit of avoiding years of legal wrangling and uncertaintly about
rates.
   Gregg, whose office had no comment this morning, charged Tuesday
that the Democrats' real agenda in opposing Northeast is stopping
Seabrook.
   Democrats are espousing ``the old agenda of let's kill Seabrook
at any cost, even if the cost is that New Hampshire consumers end
up paying a lot more for energy and may not have the available
supply they need in the future,'' Gregg said.
   Chambers denied it.
   ``The Seabrook issue is really a minor issue in all of this,''
she said Tuesday. ``This plan gives absolutely no protection to
consumers and permits the company to make incredible profits.''
   Republicans outnumber Democrats 3-1 in the House and 2-1 in the
Senate, but Chambers said Tuesday she doubted that Republicans had
sufficient votes to pass the Northeast plan. Gregg disagreed,
predicting the plan would pass.
   Even if the Legislature passes the Northeast plan, it would need
approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Yacos and various
government agencies.
   Any changes to the plan presumably would require the approval of
Public Service creditors, whose representatives had accepted the
Northeast plan as it stood before today.

<HEAD>Blue Arrow Plans To Change Name To Manpower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blue Arrow PLC, the world's largest employment
services company, said Wednesday it is taking steps to change its
name to Manpower PLC, adopting the identity of the giant American
agency it acquired in 1987.
   The company's board of directors on Tuesday voted unanimously to
recommend the change to shareholders, it said.
   Blue Arrow Chairman Mitchell Fromstein, former head of Manpower,
obtained control of Blue Arrow management in a boardroom coup
earlier this year.
   ``Since Manpower Inc. represents over 75 percent of the
company's revenues and profits, and is the multinational brand
among the company's holdings, it is appropriate to make this
change,'' Fromstein said. ``It should surprise no one.''
   The smaller Blue Arrow bought Manpower, based in Milwaukee,
Wis., in an acrimonious $1.34 billion takeover battle two years ago.
   In January, Fromstein emerged as Blue Arrow's chief executive
after a fight among the company's directors and major U.S.
franchisees over the management practices of Antony Berry, then
chairman and chief executive.
   Fromstein was named to replace Berry as chairman in April.
   Blue Arrow has suffered a series of financial embarrassments
since the Manpower takeover, including the disclosure of a
questionable loan to a Berry associate and the cover-up by its
financial advisers of the failure of an 837 million-pound stock
sale used to fund the takeover.

<HEAD>Lockerbie Legacy Makes Terrorism Fact of Life for Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airlines worldwide have tightened security since
the Pan Am jumbo jet terrorist explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland,
spending large amounts of money on defenses that range from
bomb-sniffing dogs to baggage X-ray gear.
   But two more big passenger planes have crashed in the year since
then in presumed terrorist sabotage, and experts warn that another
Lockerbie could happen tomorrow.
   The Flight 103 bombing that killed 259 people in midair Dec. 21,
1988, has made terrorism a sobering and expensive fact of life for
the airlines, especially the big U.S. carriers that fly overseas.
   Sophisticated bombs timed to explode during flight have replaced
hijacking as terrorists' favored mode of operation.
   The burly guards, body searches, bomb detectors and dogs trained
to smell hidden explosives have become increasingly familiar
staples of air travel, helping to drive ticket prices higher.
   The Federal Aviation Administration sent a key directive to U.S.
airlines a month after the Lockerbie crash, requiring specific
measures for inspecting baggage and screening passengers. For
example, the FAA has ordered installation of sophisticated
explosive-detection gear in 40 airports by next October.
   ``The aviation industry has taken steps to ensure better
controls,'' said Don W. Walker, president of Business Risks
International, a consulting firm. But, he said, ``terrorism is
escalating worldwide; the terrorists are generally one step ahead
of what airlines are able to do.''
   In July 1988, the airlines intensified anti-terrorist defenses
in response to the Navy's downing of an Iran Air jetliner. But
terrorists sneaked a sophisticated explosive through Pan Am's
security system six months later.
   After the Pan Am bombing, the airlines again strengthened
security. Then, last September, a UTA French Airline DC-10 exploded
over Niger, Africa, in a suspected bombing that killed 174 people
including seven Americans.
   In November an Avianca Airlines Boeing 727 crashed near Bogota,
Colombia, in what authorities called a suspected bombing by drug
traffickers retaliating for a government crackdown.
   Airlines once declined to discuss security. But in the aftermath
of the Lockerbie disaster, the airline industry has started making
security a subtle part of its marketing campaign to attract and
reassure passengers.
   For example, extensive publicity has been given to the so-called
thermal neutron analysis explosive detectors that the FAA has
required. Pan Am and Trans World Airlines have been the first to
install the new devices.
   The company that makes them, Science Applications International
Corp., said they will be ``an important working model for other
airlines to learn from as the FAA security program goes forward.''
   Still, most carriers still won't talk specifically about how
much money they spend, although it is in the millions of dollars.
They also criticize the government for not absorbing more of the
cost.
   ``The airline industry is the surrogate target for the
government,'' said Homer Boynton, director of security for American
Airlines, the largest U.S. carrier. ``The government ought to give
us more help and more assistance.''
   But Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, called security ``a cost of doing business.
Traditionally, the airlines have paid the cost of equipment needed
for security reasons.''
   Like jet fuel and passenger food, airline security is an expense
that comes out of revenues or as a special surcharge added to
ticket prices that passes the bill to travelers. Pan Am, for
example, adds $5 to the cost of a one-way trans-Atlantic ticket.
   Boynton said American is the only major U.S. airline that uses
its own employees for all security work. Most big carriers have
their own security divisions but also contract with outside
companies for passenger screening in airports and other protective
services.
   American, which operates a growing number of flights to Europe,
spends $11 million to $12 million a year on security, Boynton said.
   Its program is partly modeled on that of Israel's El Al
Airlines, which has a reputation for the toughest security measures.
   Spokesmen for American, Pan Am, Trans World Airlines, Eastern
Airlines, British Airways and Japan Air Lines, queried by the
Associated Press, all said their carriers strengthened what they
called already-tight security after Lockerbie. Representatives of
UTA and Avianca said those airlines stepped up security after
disaster struck them.
   While financially strong airlines such as American can afford
top-quality security as well as newer, safer jets, there is concern
that weaker carriers could be tempted to cut corners.
   Pan Am, for example, lost $158.3 million for the first nine
months of this year, compared with a loss of $21 million in the
same period in 1988. In every financial quarter since Lockerbie,
Pan Am has largely blamed its poor financial condition on falling
trans-Atlantic passenger traffic resulting from the crash. In a
recent ABC News special broadcast, some former security employees
of Pan Am alleged serious deficiencies in the airline's screening
system. According to ABC, the Pan Am security supervisor in
Frankfurt, West Germany, where Flight 103 originated had a criminal
record, unknown to the airline.
   The former employees charged that Pan Am's security was
compromised by cost-cutting and concern about on-time performance.
   Because it has been sued by a number of relatives of Lockerbie
crash victims, Pan Am cannot respond specifically to the
allegations about its Alert Security Co., said Pan Am spokesman
Jeff Kriendler. He called the charges ``false and misleading'' and
``a vindictive effort to discredit a former employer.''
   ``We strongly reject any suggestion that Pan Am or Alert would
have deliberately compromised the safety of passengers and crew
members to effect on-time departure or to cut costs,'' Kriendler
said.
   Last August, President Bush created the Presidential Commission
on Aviation Security and Terrorism, scheduled to make
recommendations to him next spring. The seven-member panel, headed
by former labor secretary Ann McLaughlin, plans to evaluate
aviation security, the handling of terrorist threats against air
travel and whether the public should be told of them, and the
government's treatment of terrorists' victims.
   At its first hearing, on Nov. 17, former FAA security director
Billie H. Vincent told the panel that air security is ``seriously
deficient'' in high-threat areas such as Europe and the Middle East.
   Other experts agree.
   ``We are way behind in taking the necessary measures that will
help to prevent this kind of tragedy happening again,'' terrorism
expert Paul Wilkinson recently told a news conference in London.
``Another Lockerbie could happen tomorrow.''

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in light-volume
buying linked largely to weather concerns.
   Bitter cold temperatures in the nation's midsection are stirring
fears of damage to the winter wheat crop in the Great Plains and
spurring demand for soybean meal among cattle producrs.
   ``When the weather gets cold, they have to increase the energy
component in the feed mix, so they feed the cattle more meal,''
said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago.
   The soybean market was further supported by fears that the
continuing dry weather in southern Brazil, the world's
second-largest soybean producer, would stretch into a drought.
   The corn market rallied slightly on commercial buying, possibly
indicating that new export sales are in the works, Karlin said.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 2 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.14 a bushel; corn
futures were unchanged to 2\ cents higher with December at $2.33 a
bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to { cent higher with December at

<HEAD>IBM Packs Billion Bits of Data on One-Inch of Disk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine a stack of 100,000
double-spaced, typewritten pages _ enough paper to make a stack 33
feet tall _ shrunk to one square inch.
   International Business Machines Corp. claimed Wednesday to have
achieved that condensing job by storing, for the first time, a
billion bits of information on a square inch of magnetic material.
   The record data density is 15 to 30 times greater than that of
current magnetic hard disks, which are used for storing data, IBM
said.
   It will be several years, though, before billion-bit, or
``gigabit'' disks, will be available commercially, IBM said.
   IBM invented the first commercial magnetic hard disk drives in
the mid-1950s, and they have since become the most popular devices
for storing computer data.
   In the gigabit demonstration at IBM's Almaden Research Center in
San Jose, an aluminum disk was coated with a thin film of a
magnetic cobalt alloy, which held the recorded bits.
   Experimental equipment recorded and read at a data rate of 3.5
million bytes per second. The measured error rates were
sufficiently low _ one in a billion, decreasing to one in 10
trillion when error correction codes were used _ to meet the
requirements of the computer industry.
   That latter accuracy level, IBM said, was the equivalent of
transcribing more than 10,000 years of a newspaper before making a
mistake.

<HEAD>Moody's Drops Chrysler Debt Rating 1 Notch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. on Wednesday
dropped its debt ratings for Chrysler Corp. and its financial
subsidiary by one notch amid concern over vehicle sales,
competition and capital expenditures.
   Fitch Investors Service Inc. said it was reviewing Chrysler's
securities and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said no change was likely.
   Movement in security ratings indicate increasing or decreasing
faith in the creditworthiness of a company.
   Moody's said in a news release that it was lowering a variety of
Chrysler securities because of ``concerns that Chrysler's operating
performance will remain under pressure over the intermediate
term,'' or three to four years.
   Moody's rating for Chrysler's senior debt was lowered to
``Baa2'' from ``Baa1.'' Moody's analyst Carol Verschell said that
was toward the lower end of the company's investment-grade ratings.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston read a statement saying: ``We're
disappointed in the action that Moody's has taken. But we believe
that it will not have any material effect on Chrysler ... borrowing
costs.''
   Moody's also said Chrysler's share of the light truck market,
which includes the company's popular minivans and Jeep vehicles,
will come under increasing competitive pressure.
   Chrysler's announcement earlier this month to sell Chrysler
Technologies Corp., which includes Gulfstream Aerospace Inc., will
provide some cash, Verschell said, but the timing of the sale and
the amount are uncertain.
   At Fitch, auto analyst Mary Anne Sudol said her firm's ratings
for a variety of Chrysler securities were either the same or
slightly higher than Moody's new ratings. All Chrysler ratings were
under review, she said.
   ``There will be some action, but I don't know when it will
come,'' Sudol said.
   Nancy Stroker of Standard &amp; Poor's said her company affirmed the
``BBB'' rating of Chrysler securities, roughly the same level as
Moody's. ``We don't expect to have any kind of rating change,'' she
said.
   Verschell said Moody's was not reviewing the ratings of General
Motors Corp. or Ford Motor Co. securities.
   Moody's announcement of lower Chrysler's ratings came before the
company reported that sales of its North American-made cars and
trucks fell 25.1 percent in early December, compared with the same
time last year.
   Through Dec. 10, Chrysler's vehicle sales were running 6.7
percent behind last year's pace. The automaker's financial
subsidiary is Chrysler Financial Corp.

<HEAD>Police Warning Follows Computer Sabotage Disks in Mail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer disks purporting to give information
about AIDS have damaged computers at British banks, hospitals,
universities and commercial institutions, police said Wednesday.
   The Fraud Squad at Scotland Yard police headquarters said an
unspecified ``destructive mechanism'' had been found in the disks
which had rendered computers unusable in 10 cases.
   The squad said it had reports of the floppy disks being received
by mail in different parts of the country, from London to Edinburgh
in Scotland. There were no confirmed reports of the disk being
received outside Britain.
   The squad said it was investigating criminal damage caused by
the disks to computers at banks, hospitals, universities and
commercial institutions. The recipients were not identified.
   Two disks turned up Wednesday in the mail at the London Stock
Exchange and others were sent to the Australia and New Zealand
Bank, the City of London police said.
   The City police, responsible for the financial district, warned
companies to be on their guard.
   ``These disks must on no account be placed in computers. They
are obviously meant to interfere with systems,'' City police
headquarters said.
   City police said the disks apparently contained information
about the disease AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   An accompanying letter asked for a ``license fee'' of either
$189 or $378, depending on the type of license, to be sent to an
address in Panama. But the envelope was mailed in London's South
Kensington district, City police said.
   The letter warned in small print that if the money was not paid
the sender would use program mechanisms to stop a computer
functioning normally, City police said.
   Computer companies said they believed addresses for receiving
the disks had been obtained from PC Business World, a British
weekly trade paper devoted to computing.
   Joe Hirst, an expert on computer sabotage, told The Associated
Press the rogue disk was not of the virus type, which spoils
computer systems by duplicating itself, but a ``Trojan'' which does
direct damage.
   The name comes from the ancient Greek wooden horse concealing
soldiers who came out at night to destroy the city of Troy.
   ``There are two programs on the disk,'' said Hirst, former
technical editor of Virus Bulletin and a consultant on computer
software.
   ``The first is an installation program and the second is a
questionnaire on the risk of AIDS which will not run unless it is
installed on a hard disk. It then prints off an invoice for a
company in Panama but the damage has already been done by the
installation,'' he said.
   Hirst said he suspected the intention of the sender was entirely
malicious.
   ``Money does not appear to be the motivation,'' he said.
   ``It may be difficult to understand but there are people out
there who get a kick out of showing how clever they are. They may
have a grudge against the world. They enjoy the idea of doing
serious damage to people they don't know, like those who put glass
in baby food,'' he said.
   The alarm was first raised on Tuesday by Dr. Alan Solomon,
chairman of a group of users of personal computers, who said he
received a similar disk the previous day.
   ``If you have not installed it, then don't. It seems to be some
kind of sabotage,'' Solomon said.
   At the Stock Exchange, an official, speaking anonymously, said:
``You must be off your head if you get an unsolicited disk and put
it in your machine.''
   The official said the disks would never have been put into the
market trading system. If someone wanted to find out what was on
them, he said, they would have used an internal system for
transmitting office memos.

   The stock market settled for some scattered
gains today after an early advance stalled.
   Analysts said traders drew some encouragement from the Commerce
Department report that retail sales rose 0.8 percent in November,
exceeding most private estimates.
   That eased some worries on Wall Street that slackening consumer
spending might be increasing the chances of a recession in the near
future.
   But interest rates rose a bit following the news, and investors
still seemed to be cautious about the outlook for the economy in
1990 and the prospect that corporate profits might remain weak.
   Brokers also noted that the market bogged down after the Dow
Jones industrial average moved within striking distance of the
record closing high of 2,791.41 it reached on Oct. 9, before it
took a 190-point drop four days later.

<HEAD>Say Agreement Reached to Settle Cereal Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative contract settlement was
reached Wednesday between negotiators for Post Cereal and about
1,000 workers who struck 39 days earlier.
   Richard Powers, president of Local 374 of the United Cereal,
Bakery and Food Workers, said union officials were recommending
that members approve the proposal at a ratification vote scheduled
for Thursday afternoon.
   ``I'm sure the membership will support us,'' he said. ``We're
just pleased that this thing is coming to an end.''
   Workers may be back at work as early as this weekend, with most
returning on Monday, union officials said.
   Contract talks had snagged on the company's proposal to increase
worker contributions to the medical insurance plan, something
Powers said was addressed in the new contract. On Sunday, union
members rejected the company's last proposal by more than a 2-1
margin.
   Negotiators met for about two hours Tuesday and again on
Wednesday.
   ``We sincerely hope that employees will ratify this new offer so
production can resume,'' said Kathy Beiser, a spokeswoman for Post,
a division of Kraft General Foods. ``We believe that ratification
and a return to work are in the best interest of all concerned
parties.''
   The strike has shut down operations at the main plant of Post,
Battle Creek's No. 2 employer behind Kellogg Co.
   Analysts say the shutdown has added to the problems facing Post
as it suffers falling sales and a declining market share in the
ready-to-eat cereal industry.

<HEAD>Tambrands Selling Two Units in Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tambrands Inc. on Wednesday said it will sell its diagnostics
and cosmetics businesses and cut its work force as part of a
restructuring program that will allow the company to focus on its
feminine hygiene products.
   Costs associated with the restructuring will cause Tambrands to
take an after-tax charge of about $65 million against its
fourth-quarter earnings.
   ``We have a profitable core business whose positive results have
been burdened by the cost of unrelated and non-essential
activities,'' said Martin F.C. Emmett, chairman and chief executive.
   He said the restructuring program ``will enable us to focus on
our Tampax tampon business worldwide ....''
   The company, which has its headquarters in Lake Success, N.Y.,
estimates it will cut 100 to 200 employees from its current total
of 700 salaried workers, Paul E. Konney, Tambrands senior vice
president, said.
   The charge against earnings will cover the costs of trimming the
payroll, consolidating some facilities, and revaluing Tambrands'
investments in Latin America and China, its diagnostics and
cosmetics businesses and certain other assets.
   Konney said he couldn't comment on how the fourth-quarter charge
will affect earnings. The company is due to report its
fourth-quarter and full-year results in mid-February.
   He also said the company hasn't estimated the proceeds from the
planned sales of its First Response home diagnostics and Physicians
Formula hypoallergenic cosmetics businesses.
   Tambrands' stock has periodically been bid higher on takeover
speculation in recent months. Konney declined to comment on whether
the restructuring program came in response to a takeover threat.
   Through three quarters of this year, Tambrands earned $61
million, or $2.72 a share, down from $71 million, or $3.17 a share,
a year earlier. Nine-month revenue totaled $449 million this year,
up from $428 million in 1988.

<HEAD>GAF and Vice Chairman Convicted of Stock Manipulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury on Wednesday convicted GAF Corp.
and a top executive of manipulating the price of a company's stock,
as the government won another victory in its crackdown on Wall
Street fraud.
   After two previous mistrials, the jury in U.S. District Court
found GAF and Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin guilty on all eight
counts of stock manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud and
conspiracy. Two GAF subsidiaries were acquitted of all charges.
   Sherwin, 56, of Princeton, N.J., faces up to 40 years in prison
and $2 million in fines when sentenced March 9 by Judge Mary
Johnson Lowe. GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and building
materials manufacturer, could be fined a total of up to $4 million.
   Sherwin's attorney, Stephen Kaufman, said he would appeal the
conviction.
   GAF said in a statement: ``We will leave no stone unturned in
pursuing every avenue of appeal. We continue to have complete
confidence in Jim Sherwin, who will continue in his postions as
vice chairman and chief administrative officer.''
   GAF, two subsidiaries and Sherwin were indicted in July 1988 for
allegedly trying to boost the stock price of Union Carbide Corp. in
1986 shortly before selling a large block of Carbide shares.
   When the case was first presented to a jury a year ago, it
attracted wide attention as the first criminal trial stemming from
the insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s.
   Since then, several other cases have resulted in jury
convictions, including the Princeton-Newport Partners racketeering
and fraud case and the stock manipulation trial of Florida investor
Paul A. Bilzerian.
   The first GAF trial ended in mistrial last January when Lowe
determined prosecutors unintentionally withheld a piece of
evidence. A second mistrial was declared in March when the jury
deadlocked after 12 days of deliberations.
   ``Justice is finally done,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl
H. Loewenson Jr.
   After the verdict, an ashen-faced Sherwin embraced his wife and
daughters. ``I'm terribly disappointed and I'm innocent of these
charges,'' he said to reporters.
   The subsidiaries found innocent of the charges were Jay &amp;
Company Inc. and GAF Chemicals Corp.
   The government's case against GAF was based largely on the
testimony of Los Angeles broker Boyd L. Jefferies, an admitted
felon who has payed a key role in other securities fraud cases as
part of a plea agreement with the government.
   Jefferies testified that Sherwin asked him in October 1986 to
boost Union Carbide's price to $22 a share and agreed to pay
$40,000 to cover losses in the deal.
   A higher stock price would have meant more money for GAF, which
had accumulated 10 million shares of Union Carbide during a failed
takeover bid in 1986. GAF sold five million shares to Salomon
Brothers Inc. for $23 each on Nov. 10.
   After a six-week trial, the jury returned its verdict after
about eight hours of deliberations, compared with some 93 hours in
the second mistrial.
   The verdict also came despite the introduction of new evidence
in the trial's last week that apparently contradicted key testimony
by Jefferies and a trading asistant at his firm.
   Defense attorneys introduced telephone records indicating that
no calls were placed on long-distance WATS lines from the Jefferies
&amp; Co. brokerage to GAF or Sherwin during times in October 1986 when
the government alleged the manipulation was discussed.
   Defense lawyers had branded Jefferies as a crook who had schemed
illegally with jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky, who paid $100
million to settle insider trading charges in late 1986.
   Boesky fingered Jefferies, who last year agreed to plead guilty
to two securities law violations. Jefferies earlier this year was
sentenced to five years probation and a $250,000 fine.

<TEXT>
   A visit to a Laura Ashley store, with its dark
green front and blackberry sprig motif, woodsy interior and
heathery scents, conjures up images of the cozy, privileged gentry
of England.
   You expect to bump into young, upper class ``English roses''
with cultivated accents and gorgeous complexions, who attend
society balls, drive Range Rovers and adore their terriers.
   But behind the scenes, times are tough for Laura Ashley Holdings
PLC, the British retailer famous for popularizing the frilly
clothes and home furnishings of the English countryside.
   Business is suffering because of a slowdown in British and U.S.
retail sales, high interest rates in Britain, and the weak dollar,
which makes British goods more expensive for American buyers.
   Laura Ashley as responded by entering the male market and
updating its designs. Retailing industry analysts believe the
company will survive the crisis and prosper.
   Profits have been disappointing for the past three years,
repeatedly undershooting estimates and leaving the public holding
shares worth nearly half the price they fetched when Laura Ashley
went public four years ago.
   The company recently announced it would cut 100 jobs _ the first
major layoffs ever _ in its struggle to restructure and boost
profits.
   Laura Ashley is a classic rags-to-riches tale, begun as a small
cottage industry 36 years ago by Mrs. Ashley and husband Bernard on
the kitchen table of a London attic flat.
   It became an international force, but analysts say it has failed
to change with the times. Traditional shops are near the saturation
point in Britain and the United States.
   However, the Laura Ashley look has proved to have enduring
appeal.
   Welsh-born Mrs. Ashley's legacy includes ``a vibrant design
ethos in tune with nostalgia for the past as well as the New Age
ideology of the Nineties,'' fashion writer Liz Smith recently wrote
in the Times of London.
   A great void was created in the company when Mrs. Ashley, known
as ``LA,'' died of head injuries in September 1985 at age 60 after
a fall down steep stairs at her daughter's west England home.
   It happened just as the company was opening a flagship store in
London and two months before Laura Ashley shares were sold on the
stock market.
   Mrs. Ashley's successors insisted the business would thrive
because it was a design house, not a one-woman show. But the
company says her original concepts remain the foundation.
   Bernard Ashley, knighted in 1987, continues as chairman, but
pursues other interests, such as the development of a chain of
Ashley Inn hotels.
   The day-to-day management is left to John James, a Welshman and
longtime employee named chief executive two years ago. The Ashleys'
son Nick, one of four children, serves as design director. The
Ashley family, with the Ashley Foundation, retains 70 percent of
the company's stock.
   The situation is quite different from 1985, when investors
rushed to benefit from Laura Ashley's expansion plans. Crowds lined
up to buy Laura Ashley shares in a $36 million sale that was 34
times oversubscribed.
   The shares sold for the equivalent of $2.12 each. Now they trade
at the equivalent of $1.26 at London's Stock Exchange.
   Earnings fell 38 percent to $6.6 million or 3 cents a share, on
a 15 percent revenue gain to $211 million in the six months ended
July 29.
   ``It is having problems. It's a very difficult phase,'' said
Joan d'Olier, retail analyst at the London investment firm County
Natwest Woodmac. ``There's a lot of potential there still, but it's
very difficult to realize it.''
   Analyst Kimlan Cook of the Smith New Court PLC investment firm
said: ``It hasn't been that nobody likes Laura Ashley clothes
anymore. It's just a question of translating that into profits,
which Laura Ashley has quite frankly failed to do.''
   Mrs. Cook blamed that failure on what she called undirected
growth and inadequate financial controls. The company's
manufacturing segment, which makes most of what Laura Ashley sells,
hasn't been responding to retailing demands.
   The Ashleys started printing fabrics on the kitchen table in
1953. Bernard designed furnishing prints and printing machines,
Laura made place mats and scarves which she sold to London
department stores.
   The couple expanded into garments and eventually into
accessories, wall paper and soft furnishings.
   The clothes are affordable, feminine, and rural. Made of natural
fabrics, they have flowing lines, wildflower prints, frills and
bows. The company sells lots of sweet dresses, high neck blouses,
sailor outfits, and navy blue basics.
   ``I don't like ephemeral things,'' Laura Ashley once said. ``I
like things that last forever, like the straw hat you're fond of
and wear all your life.''
   The Ashleys moved to Wales in 1961 and six years later
established company headquarters in a disused railway station in
Carno.
   The first Laura Ashley shop opened in London's posh South
Kensington district in 1968, and in 1974 the first American store
opened in San Francisco.
   The Laura Ashley look, harking back to an imagined Victorian age
of bucolic simplicity, also struck a chord in the United States,
where sales quickly rivaled sales at home.
   At the end of its last fiscal year, Laura Ashley operated 172
stores in North America, and 164 in Britain and Ireland. It had
more than 400 shops worldwide, 8,000 employees and 17 factories.
   Despite the fast growth, maternal Mrs. Ashley considered
employees ``an extension of our family.'' She gave them stock,
ended the workweek early on Friday, and insisted the canteen serve
healthy food.
   Its present, more corporate-minded management has sought to slim
down operations, and has broken the company into divisions
responsible for their onw profits.
   Laura Ashley also has been acquiring some smaller clothing and
accessory businesses, updating its clothing designs to give widen
appeal, and opening free-standing home furnishings stores to
attract more men. It also has developed a popular ``Mother and
Child'' collection of coordinated clothes.
   ``How long that (strategy) will take to bear fruit to the bottom
line is another question,'' Mrs. Cook said.

   The stock market churned ahead in erratic
yearend trading Wednesday, extending the advance it began the day
before.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 16 points
at midsession, closed with a 8.96 gain at 2,761.09. On Tuesday it
climbed 23.89 points.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 791 up, 734
down and 496 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders drew some encouragement from the Commerce
Department report that retail sales rose 0.8 percent in November,
exceeding most private estimates.
   That eased a few worries on Wall Street that slackening consumer
spending might be increasing the chances of a recession in the near
future.
   But open-market interest rates rose following the news, and
investors still seemed to be cautious about the outlook for the
economy in 1990 and the prospect that corporate profits might
continue to lag.
   Brokers also noted that the market bogged down after the Dow
Jones industrial average moved within striking distance of the
record closing high of 2,791.41 it reached on Oct. 9, before it
took a 190-point drop four days later.
   Energy stocks were mixed in active trading, running into some
resistance after their recent rally inspired by cold weather in
many parts of the United States and forecasts of higher oil prices
in the months ahead.
   Among the volume leaders, Baker Hughes rose [ to 26~; Exxon
dropped { to 50}; Amoco lost } to 54~, and Texaco was down ~ at 56\.
   In the blue-chip industrial sector, Philip Morris rose \ to 43;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 1{ to 46|; Coca-Cola } to 80\, and
DuPont 1 to 124[.
   But leading computer and technology issues were weak, apparently
depressed by yearend tax selling. International Business Machines
dropped 1[ to 95~ and Digital Equipment was down 2] at 82|, trading
at its lowest levels in more than three years.
   UAL fell 8 to 168} as hopes diminished for emergence of a new
deal to replace the buyout plan by an employee-management group
that was dropped this fall after it ran into financing problems.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 184.66 million
shares, up from 176.82 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 220.86 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $6.55 billion, or 0.19
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .57 to 195.01.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .36 to 403.07, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 1.02 at 352.75.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
.71 to 451.14. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 378.05, up .64.

   U.S. retailers' sales rebounded in November,
the government said Wednesday in a report analysts saw as showing
stronger-than-expected Christmas buying and less chance of a
recession.
   The 0.8 percent increase, the biggest in four months, ``clearly
signals that the economy is resilient,'' said Richard W. Rahn,
chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Fears of a poor
Christmas retail season should abate with this report.''
   ``It's clearly stronger than was expected,'' said David Jones,
an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York government
securities dealer. ``As long as spending holds up, there's no
threat of a recession.''
   The Commerce Department said that sales rose to a seasonally
adjusted $144.6 billion in November after plummeting 1.3 percent in
October, when they were driven down by skidding automobile sales.
The October sales were revised after originally being reported to
have fallen 1 percent.
   Many economists were expecting only a weak improvement in
November since unit car sales fell again in November.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group in
Washington, said the 0.5 percent increase in the automotive
category probably reflected an increase in prices, not sales.
Excluding the auto category, the report was even more positive,
showing a 0.9 percent advance.
   Automakers reported Wednesday that sales of cars and trucks by
the nation's eight major automakers continued to drop in early
December, sinking 23.7 percent from last year's level.
   Jones suggested a shift in Christmas-present buying patterns
might have contributed to the November strength and might mean more
moderate growth this month.
   ``We're getting more and more spending in the last week of
November and less in the first weeks of December,'' he said. ``The
way to measure the Christmas season now is to average the November
and December spending patterns.''
   And Ms. Shaber added, ``It's taken a lot of price-slashing to
get those sales. So even if dollar sales are decent this Christmas,
it's unclear whether the profits will be so great.''
   Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's
economic activity, and David Wyss, senior financial economist for
DRI@McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., said the stronger November
report caused him to boost his estimate of overall growth.
   Wyss said if strong sales continue in December, the gross
national product could increase at a 1 percent rate in the final
quarter of the year instead of the 0.5 percent he had been
predicting.
   ``This relieves the worries that the fourth quarter could turn
into a negative quarter,'' he said.
   Not all analysts were as upbeat, however. Bruce Steinberg,
senior economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York,
pointed out that sales in both September and October had been
revised downward.
   ``I don't think we are going to have a recession, but it is
still iffy,'' Steinberg said.
   There had been concern that Christmas spending would be held
back by a slowing economy.
   But even sales of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to
last at least three years _ posted a 0.7 percent gain after falling
3 percent in October. These sales often are affected by the Fed's
interest-rate policies because many are financed by loans.
   Sales of building materials were up 2 percent, reflecting in
part repairs following Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco
Bay-area earthquake. The category had fallen 1.1 percent in October.
   Furniture and other home furnishing sales gained 1.6 percent on
top of a 0.8 percent increase the previous month.
   Sales of non-durable goods rose 0.9 percent, following a 0.3
percent decline in October.
   All non-durable goods categories except drug stores posted
increases: general merchandise including department stores sales,
up 0.7 percent; grocery stores, 0.8 percent; gasoline stations, 0.9
percent; apparel, 2.4 percent, and restaurants and bars, 0.9
percent.
   Drug store sales were down 0.1 percent.
   For the three months from August through October, overall retail
sales were up 4.8 percent. Sales for the first 11 months of 1989
were up 5.7 percent over the same period of 1988.

   Gold prices tumbled in worldwide trading
Wednesday, while the dollar finished mixed against other major
currencies in choppy, hectic dealings after rebounding overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $408.10 a troy ounce, down $9.80 from late
Tuesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $408 an ounce, down $9. The plunge in gold also helped
depress other precious metals, such as silver.
   Dealers attributed gold's decline largely to profit-taking from
its recent steady rise and to technical market factors. They noted
particularly strong selling by Middle East investors.
   In currency trading, Zlatko Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at
the New York office of Banco di Sicilia, likened Wednesday's
trading to ``a tug of war between the bulls and the bears.''
   ``The bulls would like to see the dollar go up and they say it
has reached its bottom, but the bears are trying to pulling it
lower and seem to be winning the battle overall,'' Glamuzina said.
   The dollar got a boost from rumors that Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev had resigned, although they were swiftly denied by the
Soviet Embassy in Washington, currency dealers said. Also
supporting the dollar were reports of intervention by some central
banks to push down the value of the surging West Germany mark, they
said.
   Putting a damper on the dollar, however, was speculation that
the Federal Reserve was easing interest rates.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.77 Japanese yen to close at 143.70 yen.
It traded at 144.13 yen in London, and at 144.05 yen in New York,
up from 144.00 yen late Tuesday.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound. Sterling
bought $1.5955 in London, down from $1.6027 Tuesday; and $1.6000 in
New York, down from $1.6085 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.7280 West German marks, down from
1.7322; 1.5645 Swiss francs, down from 1.5732; 5.9070 French
francs, down from 5.9185; 1,289.00 Italian lire, up from 1,284.75;
and 1.1597 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1625.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday, included:
1.7390 West German marks, up from 1.7335; 1.5965 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5765; 5.9475 French francs, up from 5.9275; 1.9430 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9715; 1,296.25 Italian lire, up from
1,285.75; and 1.1585 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1625.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $411.25 an ounce from
$417.50 Tuesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold slipped to $411.00 an
ounce from $416.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.08 to close at a bid $414.73
an ounce.
   Silver prices also fell sharply. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.544, down from $5.672
late Tuesday. Silver fell in London to $5.59 an ounce from $5.70.

   Mexico's reviving economy is on display at
La Plaza Mall, where the parking lot is full of license plates from
across the border.
   In this city 10 miles north of the Rio Grande, and all along the
U.S.-Mexico frontier, one fact of international trade stands out:
Mexican shoppers have returned to the United States to visit and
shop, recovering from the brutal 1980s that brought ``la crisis.''
   The Banco Nacional de Mexico says Mexicans are spending as much
and possibly more money on the U.S. side of the border than they
did 10 years ago.
   As a result, McAllen's La Plaza Mall has the highest sales per
square foot of any of the 70 U.S. shopping centers owned by the
Indianapolis, Ind.-based Melvin Simon and Associates, said Tom
Jenkins, southern regional manager with the firm. La Plaza's
average merchandise sales of $404 per square foot is more than
double the firm's national average of $189 per square foot.
   The company's No. 2 mall is El Paso's Cielo Vista, with sales of
$338 per square foot, Jenkins said.
   He attributes much of the border malls' success to the crowds of
Mexican shoppers returning over the past two years.
   ``The Mexican nationals, what they're looking for is quality,''
Jenkins said. ``They are not looking for sales.''
   ``We have a lot of Monterrey traffic that drives, a lot of
traffic from Mexico City that fly and the regular bus traffic that
come across,'' said Tommy Joyner, executive director of the McAllen
Chamber of Commerce.
   That is a vast improvement over just a few years ago. After huge
oil revenues and massive public spending and borrowing led to a
brief boom from 1979-81, a sudden drop in oil prices in 1981
fractured the Mexican economy.
   Mexicans watched the peso diminish from a value of 26 to the
dollar at the beginning of 1982, to 149 to the dollar by the end of
that year.
   Border retailers on the U.S. side soon found their stores empty.
The Mexicans' money suddenly bought only one-sixth of what it used
to buy, so they no longer could shop in the United States. The
disappearance of the Mexican shopper quickly drove many stores out
of business all along the border.
   Mexican expenditures in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and
California by 1983 dropped to half of what they were in 1979.
   Business in 1983 was off 80 percent in downtown McAllen, said
Larry Fallek, owner of Mike's Man Shop and the Palais de Parfum in
downtown McAllen and another men's clothing store at La Plaza Mall.
   He estimated that 85 percent of his downtown sales and 60
percent of mall sales are to Mexicans.
   Although the peso by 1987 dropped to 2,500 to the dollar as
foreign debt plagued the nation, Mexico's economy since has begun
to calm down. The exchange rate fell only to about 2,650 by
December 1989.
   Mexicans are spending abroad again because the peso has
stabilized, and because of new confidence in President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's economic liberalization, said Isabel Bagnasco,
an economist with the Mexico City-based Banco Nacional de Mexico.
   ``We are now having an economy with stable prices,'' she said.
   If Mexican spending on the U.S. side of the border for the
second half of 1989 continues at the rate of the first half, U.S.
retailers will surpass the $2.24 billion sales to Mexicans that
Banco Nacional estimated for the boom year of 1979. During 1988,
Mexican purchases of $2.09 billion in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona
and California were $500 million higher than in 1987, the bank said.
   Steady growth in Mexico's 1,500 border assembly plants, or
``maquiladoras,'' also has boosted the buying power of a new
industrial work force of about 350,000.
   ``When Mexico comes across, it stirs up the whole economy,''
said retailer Fallek in McAllen. ``They feel better about
themselves, about their country and their government. Right now,
they don't seem so worried.''
   Retail sales growth of 22.6 percent in 1988 in the McAllen area
was the biggest increase of all the state's metropolitan areas,
according to the State Comptroller's office. In the adjacent
Brownsville-Harlingen area at the southern tip of the state, retail
sales grew by 15.8 percent in 1988. In El Paso, the retail growth
rate was 9.5 percent.
   For comparison, sales grew state wide by only 6.4 percent in
1988.
   Retailers say this year will turn out even better. Fallek said
the gradual return of the Mexican shoppers since last year will
make 1989 his best year since 1981.
   Brownsville retailer Michael Begum said he also has seen a
steady improvement in sales since the peso crash cut his sales in
half. His downtown New Yorker store caters to customers like the
woman from Matamoros, Mexico, who on a recent Friday stopped in
looking for something to wear to a party and bought a $2,500 fur
coat.
   At the other end of the border, San Ysidro, Calif., retailers
see the same recovery, said Doug Perry, president of the Chamber of
Commerce.
   ``There doesn't seem to be a lot of (retail) space available for
anything, particularly close to the border,'' Perry said.
   Another positive economic sign in Mexico is the cooling of its
runaway inflation that hit 159 percent in 1987. Inflation dropped
to 52 percent in 1988, and is projected to be 20 percent for 1989
and 15 percent in 1990.
   Inflation, however, still makes many products cheaper in the
United States than in Mexico. Inflation-fighting consumers can be
found among the Mexicans driving or flying home with new dresses
and toys, as well as those carrying bags of toilet paper and
groceries across the international bridges.

<HEAD>Great Northern Wages Battle Against Georgia-Pacific Solely in Courts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Great Northern Nekoosa
Corp. said Wednesday his paper company is not discussing any
``white knight'' friendly mergers or defensive restructuring to
thwart the takeover attempt by Georgia-Pacific Corp.
   Great Northern instead is pinning its hopes on courtroom
decisions to fend off the unsolicited $63 a share tender offer,
valued at a total of $3.8 billion.
   ``While we're in the courts we're not considering anything
else,'' William R. Laidig, chairman and chief executive of Great
Northern.
   ``Naturally we're talking to our financial advisers about what
the future would look like when we finish winning this court fight
with Georgia-Pacific, but there's actually no specific work going
on right now and we certainly are not looking for a white knight,''
Laidig said.
   Laidig said other paper company executives have brought up the
takeover attempt but he has made sure not to get into any talks
about alternate mergers. When Georgia-Pacific made its initial
offer of $58 per share on Oct. 31, there was speculation by some
analysts that other paper companies might enter the bidding, but
that has not happened.
   Great Northern stock finished down 50 cents at $61.75 a share on
Wednesday. Georgia Pacific was unchanged at $50.87{ a share.
   ``I've talked to some other CEOs who have said they're sorry to
see this situation the way it is, but nobody's gone any farther
than that, because I wouldn't have let them even if they wanted
to,'' Laidig said.
   Laidig would not name any of the executives he had talked to,
but said Great Northern also has heard from foreign companies that
are watching the situation.
   ``We sell a lot overseas and there have been people who
questioned whether there was a long-term interest in staying
independent or something like that,'' Laidig said.
   ``Now whether that characterized the fact that they might be
interested in some other action or not, I don't know. We certainly
have had a lot of our customers overseas who have indicated they
are interested in whether we do or do not stay independent. But
none of them have come forward and said, `We'd like to buy you, or
buy this or buy that or anything like that.'''
   The legal battles are being fought in federal court in Maine,
where Georgia-Pacific filed a lawsuit challenging Great Northern's
``poison pill'' takeover defense and a state anti-takeover law, and
in Connecticut, where Great Northern has filed an antitrust suit
against Georgia-Pacific.
   The Federal Trade Commission in Washington also is examining the
proposed merger for potential antitrust problems and is expected to
state any objections by Dec. 21.
   ``We think that our offer for Great Northern will succeed, and
we think our acquisition offer fully complies with antritrust
laws,'' spokeswoman Gail Smith said Wednesday from
Georgia-Pacific's headquarters in Atlanta.
   Laidig was in Portland on Wednesday for a news conference at
which he defended company lawyers for persuading U.S. District
Judge Gene Carter to unseal a Georgia-Pacific consultant's study
that showed different cash-flow scenarios based on a theoretical
merger followed by sales of Great Northern mills in Maine, Georgia
and Wisconsin.
   Georgia-Pacific said the study, unsealed this week, had been
rejected long ago and accused Great Northern of a ``cheap shot.''
   Laidig said his company felt that people in Maine were entitled
to the information and Georgia-Pacific should have disclosed it
previously.
   But in response to a question, Laidig said he would not make
promises about Great Northern's willingness to protect jobs and
sensitive woodlands. The company, based in Norwalk, Conn., and
incorporated in Maine, has been in business for almost a century in
Maine and doesn't believe it has to prove anything to Mainers, he
said.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Plunge As Soviet Union Rejects Radical Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices fell sharply Wednesday on New York's
Commodity Exchange as the Soviet Union rejected reforms that many
investors had hoped would lead to a gold-backed Soviet currency.
   Futures prices of silver and platinum also plunged, frustrating
speculators in the increasingly volatile precious-metals markets.
   On other commodity markets, heating oil for near-term delivery
rose for the 11th straight day; livestock and meat futures
advanced; and grains and soybeans were mostly higher.
   Gold futures fell $9.80 to $10.80 with the contract for delivery
in December settling $9.80 lower at $408.10 a troy ounce; silver
finished 12.8 cents to 13.8 cents lower on the Comex with December
at $5.544 a troy ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures sank
$13.70 to $14.10 with the January contract settling at $504.70 a
troy ounce.
   From mid-October through late November, gold soared from near
$360 an ounce to almost $420, partly on ideas that the economic
changes sweeping Eastern Europe would include a move by the Soviet
Union to back its currency, the ruble, with gold.
   Such a move would greatly increase the ruble's value on the
world market, where it is now almost useless, facilitating trade
with other countries.
   A gold-backed ruble apparently was not discussed by the Soviet
Parliament Wednesday, but they rejected other radical economic
reforms, disappointing gold traders who had hoped for some strong
indication of change, analysts said.
   ``There's been a lot of speculation but so far not anything
done, and I think that's kind of frustrated people,'' said Stephen
Platt, metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
``People were looking for something out of the Politburo.''
   Analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. in New York said the gold
selloff also appeared linked to an unconfirmed but persistent rumor
that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had offered to resign.
   The rumor ``has shaken confidence in people who bought gold'' on
speculation of Soviet reform, he said.
   January heating oil futures surged on the New York Mercantile
Exchange following the American Petroleum Institute's report late
Tuesday of an unexpectedly large reduction in U.S. stocks of
petroleum distillates last week. Extremely cold weather in Europe
and the United States have kept demand for heating oil strong.
   Other energy futures were mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 12
cents higher with January at $20.77 a barrel; heating oil was .60
cent lower to .66 cent higher with January up .66 cent at 67.96
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .10 cent to .20 cent lower
with January at 51.93 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange with most of the strength centered in the pork-belly pit,
where prices rose sharply in a technically-inspired rebound from
recent steep losses.
   Live cattle futures settled .07 cent lower to .10 cent higher
with December at 76.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent
to .20 cent higher with January at 83.42 cents a pound; live hogs
were .15 cent lower to .78 cent higher with December at 51.70 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1 cent lower to 1.53 cent higher
with February up 1.53 cents at 51.90 cents a pound.
   Most grain and soybean futures rose on the Chicago Board of
Trade in light-volume buying linked largely to weather concerns.
   Bitter cold temperatures in the nation's midsection are stirring
fears of damage to the winter wheat crop in the Great Plains and
spurring demand among cattle producers for soybean meal, a
high-energy feed additive.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 1} cents higher with December at
$4.14{ a bushel; corn futures were \ cent to 2\ cents higher with
December at $2.33\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent lower
with December at $1.43} a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 7
cents higher with January at $5.80{ a bushel.

<HEAD>Guilty Verdict Another Notch in Government's Belt</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-GAF Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The conviction of GAF Corp. and its vice
chairman strengthens a belief that the government's pursuit of
white-collar wrongdoing is getting through to the public, lawyers
said Wednesday.
   One day after hotel queen Leona Helmsley was sentenced to seven
years in prison for tax evasion, a federal jury convicted chemicals
manufacturer GAF Corp. and vice chairman James T. Sherwin of stock
manipulation, securities fraud and other charges.
   The verdict _ which followed two mistrials in the same case
earlier this year _ was another notch in the government's belt of
securities fraud convictions.
   But some lawyers said it was surprising because of controversial
and often contradictory testimony by admitted felon Boyd L.
Jefferies and surprise evidence introduced at the trial's close
undermining central portions of the government's case.
   ``The pattern you see from a variety of these cases is that if
there is some smoke there _ circumstantial evidence _ then juries
tend to find there is some fire,'' Columbia University securities
law professor John C. Coffee Jr. said.
   ``I do think the jury particularly in Wall Street cases has a
good deal of skepticism of the motives of people,'' he said. ``This
is a case where there was some evidence but it was a one-witness
case.''
   Wayne, N.J.-based GAF, Sherwin and two subsidiaries were
convicted of eight counts of stock manipulation, securities fraud,
wire fraud and conspiracy. Two GAF subsidiaries were acquitted of
all charges.
   They were found guilty of manipulating the price of Union
Carbide Corp. stock in collaboration with Jefferies in October
1986, seeking to push up the share price before selling a large
block GAF had amassed in a failed takeover.
   With the exception of one split verdict, juries this year have
returned convictions in all major Wall Street fraud cases _ against
six defendants in the Princeton-Newport Partners trial, takeover
specialist Paul A. Bilzerian, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. bond
trading assistant Lisa Jones and others.
   In addition, the government has obtained guilty pleas from
figures such as former investment banker Martin A. Siegel,
arbitrager Robert Freeman and stock speculator Salim B. Lewis.
   ``It's another part of the message that the U.S. attorney's
office has been sending to the financially fortunate of our
country, that manipulation of our financial mechanisms and failure
to pay taxes are going to be severely dealt with,'' said attorney
Gerald Walpin, a former prosecutor.
   The GAF jury returned a verdict after about only eight hours of
testimony. The second mistrial, in March, was declared after 12
days and 93 hours of deliberations. The first mistrial was declared
because the government unintentionally withheld a piece of evidence.
   ``Maybe all the media concentration on fraud on Wall Street has
pressured the public that all the fraud on Wall Street was more
severe than it thought initially,'' said Alan Bromberg, a
securities law professor at Southern Methodist University.
   ``I think we're developing a pretty healthy distrust of our
financial institutions,'' he said.
   GAF lawyer Arthur Liman introduced evidence in the last week of
the trial that appeared to show that telephone calls allegedly made
by Jefferies to Sherwin after Jefferies tried to manipulate the
stock never actually occurred.
   ``It seemed to be a pretty significant piece of evidence but the
jury didn't think so,'' said one defense lawyer in a major case who
asked not to be named.

   Energy futures prices finished mixed Wednesday
with demand strong for wholesale home heating oil for delivery next
month.
   A collapse in a rally in European gasoil, the equivalent of U.S.
heating oil, took some of the edge off the buying enthusiasm here,
analysts said.
   The contract for January delivery of No.2 heating oil rose 0.66
cent to 67.96 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
adding to Tuesday's gain of 0.35 cent. But contracts for delivery
during February through April fell by amounts ranging from 0.35
cent to 0.60 cent.
   The nearby heating oil contract gained support from continuing
cold weather in parts of the United States and particularly strong
demand for New York Harbor oil. Predictions of rising temperatures
in Europe discouraged buyers in London.
   Among other refined oil products traded on the New York Merc,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for January delivery, which dropped
0.37 cent on Tuesday, sank another 0.10 cent to 51.93 cents a
gallon. Other contracts also closed lower.
   The weakening in gasoline futures is typical for this time of
year when driving declines due to bad weather conditions.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 12 cents to $20.77 per 42-gallon
barrel. The February through April contracts ended 1 cent lower to
4 cents higher.
   Richard Kane, a trader for Merrill Lynch Energy Futures, said
prices opened higher in reaction to a fairly bullish report from
the American Petroleum Institute. The weekly statistics, released
after the market closed on Tuesday, showed an unexpectedly large
reduction in crude oil stocks.
   The initial strength faded in what Kane characterized as a
technical price correction.

<HEAD>Macy's Quarterly Loss Widens Due to Markdowns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. on Wednesday disclosed its
financial losses grew significantly in the late summer and early
autumn due to costs promotions aimed at boosting sales.
   The retailer said it lost $33.12 million, or $23.92 a share, in
its first fiscal quarter of 1990, compared with a loss of $19
million, or $15 a share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Sales rose 5.2 percent to $1.71 billion in the three months
ended Oct. 28 from $1.62 billion a year earlier.
   Macy, which went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986,
disclosed the losses in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   In a separate letter to investors, Macy Chairman Edward S.
Finkelstein described the retailing climate as ``chaotic'' and said
the first quarter results were ``somewhat disappointing although
essentially as expected.''
   In the SEC filing, Macy attributed the first-quarter loss to the
effects of ``increased markdowns taken in response to a highly
competitive retail environment.''
   ``We expect a sluggish economy this Spring but we are determined
to run a profitable business, expensed conservatively with improved
margins even with modest sales growth,'' read the letter, which was
signed by Finkelstein and Macy President Mark S. Handler.
   Macy opened two department stores during the quarter, although
it said it doesn't plan to open any others until 1991, when one new
store is planned.
   ``That temporary hiatus of new store activity has a double
benefit: we can concentrate our energies on improvement of stores
already in operation and capital expenditures will be capped at
levels significantly below plan, enhancing our cash flow,'' the
letter read.
   Macy said losses from the San Francisco earthquake, which
damaged its Macy's California and I. Magnin subsidiaries, did not
impact the latest results.

   Integrated Resources Inc. on Wednesday announced
a second-quarter loss of more than $1 billion due to failing
businesses and cheap asset sales in a bid to avoid bankruptcy.
   The struggling financial services firm said the loss exceeded a
previously anticipated $600 million decline mainly because of
substantially lower-than-expected proceeds from the sale of its
core businesses.
   Integrated reported a loss of $1.04 billion, or $141.15 a share,
on revenue of $70.59 million in the April-June quarter. That
compared with earnings of $12.78 million, or 68 cents a share, in
the same period a year earlier.
   The once high-flying real estate concern stumbled trying to
expand into financial services. Integrated attributed the delay in
reporting its second-quarter results to drastic changes since it
defaulted on nearly $1 billion in debt in June.
   Integrated stock closed unchanged at 37{ cents Wednesday in New
York Stock Exchange trading. Before announcing the default,
Integrated traded at around $15 a share.
   ``Obviously what happened to them in a major way is just
shocking,'' said Tom Fendrich, a managing director for Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. ``Everybody knew that Integrated was a deteriorating
situation, but nobody expected it to be an exploding one.''
   Integrated is seeking to restructure its debt and raise capital
to meet payments on a total of $1.75 billion in debt to and avoid
seeking bankruptcy court protection from its creditors.
   The bulk of the second-quarter losses was pinned on write-downs
in the value of businesses and assets Integrated has sold,
discontinued or plans to sell because of its financial troubles.
   A major contributor to the loss was the much-reduced sale price
for its central financial services businesses.
   Integrated in November reached agreement to sell the businesses
to Broad Inc., a Los Angeles financial services concern, for a
maximum of $225 million. It had hoped to receive $450 million.
   That deal, which is pending, is subject to price adjustments at
the time of closing that are expected to lower its value.
   ``These losses reflect the serious impact of our liquidity
problems,'' Integrated said in a statement. ``We are attempting to
address these problems by working with our creditors to restructure
the debt.''
   For the first six months of 1989, Integrated reported a loss of
$1.04 billion, or $141.93 a share, on revenue of $180.8 million,
compared with profits of $19.86 million, or 59 cents a share, on
$213.8 million in revenue a year earlier.
   The write-downs affect the financial services subsidiaries being
sold to Broad: Integrated Life Insurance Co. of Des Moines, Iowa;
Capitol Life Insurance Co. of Denver; Integrated Resources Asset
Management Corp., an investment adviser; Integrated Resources
Equity Corp., its main broker-dealer subsidiary; and Resources
Trust Co.
   Integrated said $110 million of the loss resulted from
restructuring expenses.
   The firm also cited poor industry conditions for the sale of
limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts, an absence
of revenue because of the termination or restructuring of some
investment programs and higher interest payments because of
increased borrowing.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Bond Rating Falls To Lowest In Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts got the lowest state credit rating
in the nation Wednesday when Standard &amp; Poor's dropped its
long-term bond rating from A to BBB.
   That put Massachusetts a step below Louisiana, which is rated
BBB Plus, said Cathy Daicoff, S&amp;P's managing director of municipal
finance.
   Only a year ago, the state's economic boom was such that it was
dubbed the Massachusetts Miracle and nearly carried Gov. Michael
Dukakis to the White House. Now the Legislature is struggling with
tax hikes to ease an estimated $800 million budget deficit for the
current fiscal year.
   ``Massachusetts is the lowest-rated state,'' Ms. Daicoff said.
   Moody's Investors Service, the other major rating service,
dropped Massachusetts last month from A to Baa 1, tying it with
Lousiana as the lowest-rated state.
   The two services use different ratings and different symbols, so
they are not directly comparable, Ms. Daicoff said.
   State Treasurer Robert Q. Crane said he wasn't surprised by
S&amp;P's action.
   ``You can't argue with the fact there is a serious shortfall,''
he said.
   ``The only way it can be addressed is by some very important and
difficult cuts in our way of life, plus an input of fresh new
revenue streams, whether they be sales tax, sin tax or income tax
increases,'' Crane said.
   Dukakis' chief financial adviser, Admininstration and Finance
Secretary L. Edward Lashman, said the bonds still carry an
investment-grade rating, allowing them to be purchased by major
pension funds and other institutional investors.
   Asked if there was a danger of Massachusetts' rating falling
into the junk-bond category, Lashman said, ``If we don't get a tax
package very soon, we are in serious danger of it.''
   Ms. Daicoff said credit rating wouldn't be upgraded immediately
even if the state were to erase the budget deficit of about $800
million for the current fiscal year.
   ``For a higher rating to be assigned, we would have to see a
sharp reversal of the financial trends of the last 18 months,'' she
said. ``We would also have to be assured that any future fiscal
problems are addressed in a prudent fashion.
   ``S&amp;P expects the state to remain under fiscal stress for some
period of time,'' she said.
   Crane said he hoped the rating would improve before February,
the next time the state plans to go to market with long-term debt,
but Lashman agreed an upgrading would take a long time.
   ``The last time this happened, it took us 13 years to get back
to a top rating,'' Lashman said.
   S&amp;P said the downgrading affects $4.6 billion in outstanding
direct general obligation state bonds.
   The ratings service also lowered from A to BBB the ratings on
$2.5 billion in agency debt secured by state guarantees. That debt
includes bonds issued by state authorities when the borrowing is
not backed up by a stream of dedicated revenue, such as tolls or
fees.
   S&amp;P also lowered the rating on $747 million in direct general
obligation short-term notes from ``SP-1'' to ``SP-2.''
   However, Ms. Daicoff said the state's planned sale of $1.2
billion in short-term commercial paper will carry the highest
A-1-Plus rating because it is backed by a letter of credit from
three Japanese banks.
   That sale includes $700 million in new borrowing and a $500
million rollover of existing short-term debt. The borrowing is
required for the state to make a $1.1 billion aid payment to cities
and towns at the end of the month.
   ``The rating is based on the banks' creditworthyness, not the
commonwealth's,'' Ms. Daicoff said.

<HEAD>Federated and Allied Department Stores Threaten Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated and Allied department stores, owned
by the deeply indebted Campeau Corp., may file for bankruptcy as
early as January if lenders don't agree to restructure their $7
billion debt, according to a published report.
   The Cincinnati-based retailers said in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing released Wednesday that they would run out of
cash by mid-March and possibly as early as January unless creditors
ease repayment schedules.
   ``What happens depends largely upon the cooperation that is
required from our bondholders and other lenders. So we will pursue
that cooperation aggressively,'' Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger
told The Cincinnati Enquirer for an article to be published in
Thursday's editions.
   According to the newspaper, the SEC filing said any hesitation
by lenders could force the company to seek federal bankruptcy
protection under Chapter 11. The document said the stores expect to
begin discussions with lenders soon, but had no assurance they
would reach agreement.
   ``Hopefully we'll be able to manage our way through this period
and conduct the restructuring process on a voluntary basis without
going the bankruptcy route,'' Ms. Sanger said.
   Campeau stock tumbled 1 to close at 4, a drop of 20 percent in
over-the-counter trading Wednesday largely on market rumors of a
possible bankruptcy filing, analysts said.
   The firms cited problems in their SEC filing that could
jeopardize their survival:
   _Performance in the fourth quarter _ the period including the
Christmas shopping season when the companies make more than half
their profits _ has fallen below a forecast that ``left little or
no margin for error.''
   _Federated could already be in default on some of the financial
performance clauses in loan agreements, and Allied will likely
breach them soon.
   _Federated must pay off $27.6 million of bonds on Jan. 27, and
another $72.0 million on Feb.1.
   ``The burdensome debt load is something that is becoming
increasingly difficult to manage,'' Ms. Sanger said. ``It requires
a tremendous amount of cash infusions.''
   Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores took on immense
debt, much of it in high interest ``junk bonds,'' as part of their
takeover by Canadian real estate magnate Robert Campeau. Campeau
bought Federated in May 1988 and Allied in December 1986.
   Their difficulty in meeting the massive interest payments
prompted an earlier financial restructuring and the ouster of
Campeau as chairman when Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. of Canada
bailed out Campeau Corp. in September.
   Toronto-based Campeau put Bloomingdale's, the crown jewel of its
retailing empire, up for sale in September after the beleagured
company said it was being forced to restructure under the weight of
$8 billion in debt from its acquisition of Federated and Allied.
   Federated is negotiating with six bidders to sell the
Bloomingdale's chain in February, in order to repay a $1.05 billion
short-term loan by April 30.
   But there is no assurance that sale will yield enough to pay the
company's debts, the document said.
   Among Federated's holdings is Lazarus department stores, a
43-store chain based in Cincinnati.
   Jerry Gafford, vice president of corporate affairs at Lazarus,
downplayed Wednesday's news.
   ``We're not worried about the possibility of being sold,'' he
said. ``This is something that needs to be done by the Campeau
organization. We're viewing it as business as usual.''
   There also is no reason to believe manufacturers will cease
merchandise shipments to the retailer, Gafford added.
   Ms. Sanger said Federated and Allied wouldn't close if they seek
federal bankruptcy protection. Chapter 11 allows companies to
remain in business while developing a plan to repay their debts.
   Wednesday's filing follows disclosure Tuesday of worsening
losses at Federated and Allied for the third quarter, despite
increases in sales.
   Besides Lazarus and Bloomingdale's, Federated operates
Manhattan's Abraham &amp; Straus, Burdines in Miami, and Rich's and the
Goldsmith stores in Atlanta.
   Allied Stores' operations include Boston-based Jordan Marsh,
Maas Brothers-Jordan Marsh in Florida, Bon Marche in Seattle and
Stern's in New Jersey.

<HEAD>Ted Turner Back in Talks With MGM-UA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable TV magnate Ted Turner is back
in the hunt for MGM-UA Communications Co., trying to negotiate a
non-cash deal for Turner Broadcasting to acquire MGM-UA, people
close to the talks said Wednesday.
   The entrepreneur needs films to feed Turner Network Television,
his year-old cable network. MGM-UA, controlled by Beverly Hills
billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, has just that: a 1,000-picture library
of United Artists movies that include the James Bond, Rocky and
Pink Panther series.
   Turner already owns rights to the even larger library of MGM
films, which he purchased from Kerkorian in 1986. If he acquired
the United Artists films and some new MGM movies from Kerkorian, he
would control rights to about 4,000 pictures.
   A parade of famous companies and individuals have considered
buying MGM-UA since Kerkorian put the studio up for sale a year and
a half ago. Bidders such as Turner and media mogul Rupert Murdoch
have been seeking programming for ventures both here and abroad.
   Murdoch, for example, has started the Fox TV network here and
extensive satellite TV ventures in Britain and in continental
Europe. He offered $1.4 billion for MGM, but was outbid in
September by Australia's Qintex group, which later was unable to
get financing for its $1.5 billion offer.
   Those offers were for cash, but Turner is instead trying to
negotiate a deal to swap stock in their companies with Kerkorian,
according to reports in the Los Angeles Times and Wall Street
Journal that were confirmed Wednesday by a studio executive.
   Extended by his many ventures, Turner ``is not sitting on a pile
of cash,'' said the executive, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The reports on the stock swap talks are the latest in a series
of stories on Kerkorian's negotiations with buyers including Turner
and two companies that own a stake in Turner Broadcasting:
Denver-based cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner
Inc. in New York.
   Among others recently interested in MGM-UA was a foreign venture
jointly controlled by MCA Inc. and Paramount Communications.
   But MCA President Sid Sheinberg said Wednesday those
negotiations had been only ``loose proposals,'' adding, ``We're
certainly not in the running for it now.''
   Neither Turner Broadcasting nor MGM-UA would comment officially
on the talks Wednesday, and Kerkorian's personal spokesman, Jim
Mahoney, said he had no knowledge of where negotiations stand.
   ``(Kerkorian) wants to make a deal,'' Mahoney said. ``The
company is in play. But if he can't make a deal, he can live with
that too. People forget that outside of (MCA chairman) Lew
Wasserman, Kirk has run a studio longer than anyone in Hollywood,
and he's been successful at it.
   Mahoney added, ``He's willing to start back into production'' of
films if no deal can be made.
   Filmmaking has virtually halted at the studio since Kerkorian
put the company up for sale in April 1988.
   Entertainment analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of the Crowell Weedon
brokerage in Los Angeles estimated it would take at least $250
million a year for two years to get the studio back into full
production, but Mahoney said that figure was far too high.

<HEAD>Boeing To Pay $500 Million In Bonuses To Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. will pay $500 million in bonuses
this month to its employees worldwide, including non-union workers,
the company said Wednesday.
   Of that amount, $374 million will go to nearly 107,000 employees
in Washington state, including more than 35,000 non-union workers
in the Seattle area.
   Both union and non-union workers will receive bonuses of 10
percent, the company said.
   Boeing, the Northwest's largest private employer, said earlier
it would give office workers, administrators and supervisors
bonuses, but did not give a percentage until Wednesday.
   Office workers have received bonuses annually, but professionals
and administrators last got bonuses three years ago, said Paul
Binder, company spokesman.
   The 43,000 members of the International Association of
Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers in the state got 10 percent bonuses
last Friday, averaging more than $3,000 each.
   Under their contract ratified Nov. 20 after a 48-day strike,
they will get bonuses of 5 percent next year and 4 percent in 1991.
   If about 28,000 members of the Seattle Professional Engineering
Employees Association approve a contract offer, they will receive
10 percent bonuses Dec. 22. The engineers and technical workers
have until Dec. 18 to vote on the tentative contract.
   The proposed offer calls for engineers to get a bonus this year
only, but technical workers would get a 5 percent bonus next year
and 4 percent the following year.
   Engineers would get an average bonus of nearly $4,000 while
technical workers would receive nearly $3,000.
   The 1989 bonuses will also be distributed in four other areas
with major Boeing operations: Wichita, Kan., $72 million;
Philadelphia, $18.5 million; Portland, Ore., $7 million; and
Huntsville, Ala., $7 million.

<HEAD>House Democrats Want Probe Into Economic Advisers' Foreign Ties</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 12th graf: ```Gephardt could,'' to note Gephardt in Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt and
other members of the Democratic leadership complained Wednesday
that President Bush is relying for economic counsel from aides who
have also served as advisers for Japan.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed the complaint
as ``a political cheap shot.''
   President Bush himself, in a brief exchange with reporters as he
left the Oval Office early in the evening, said, ``Mr. Gephardt's
complaining. So what's new?''
   Gephardt and 11 other House Democrats sent a letter to White
House counsel and ethics watchdog Boyden Gray saying they were
``deeply troubled by reports that senior officials in the
administration may be serving in the dual capacity of advising the
U.S. government while simultaneously providing counsel, advice or
other services to foreign governments ... corporations or other
foreign entities.''
   They said the chief Japan expert for the President's Council of
Economic Advisers, University of Michigan Professor Gary R.
Saxonhouse, is an adviser to Japanese financial groups, including a
research institute financed by Japan's Ministry of International
Trade and Industry.
   They also noted that Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's
council and Bush's chief economic adviser, served on the board of a
similar institute supported by the Japanese Finance Ministry before
he took his current post.
   ``This raises serious questions about conflicts of interest,''
said the Dec. 12-dated letter. The Democrats asked Gray to identify
other administration officials who ``serve in a dual capacity''
with any foreign entity.
   Fitzwater said Boskin had quit the Japanese advisory panel in
December 1988, a month before the start of the Bush administration.
Boskin was then a Stanford University economics professor; he had
been a top adviser toBush during the 1988 campaign.
   Saxonhouse is an unpaid adviser on a Japanese ministry board
that has not met in two years, said Fitzwater. He said Saxonhouse
works only part time for the White House, and ``there's no conflict
of interest.''
   Saxonhouse is not subject to ethics rules that cover the White
House staff.
   ``Gephardt's a Japan-basher, that's all,'' said Fitzwater.
   Gephardt could not be immediately reached for comment. He is in
Europe, his staff said.
   Gephardt sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988
on a platform of tough trade laws to restrict imports from
countries with big trade imbalances with the United States, such as
Japan.
   The Democrats' complaint was sparked by an article in Sunday's
New York Times on Japan's lobbying efforts in Washington and its
ties to American academics.
   Also signing the letter were Democrats William Gray of
Pennsylvania, the House majority whip; David Bonior of Michigan,
the chief deputy whip; Steny Hoyer of Maryland, chairman of the
House Democratic Caucus; Vic Fazio of California, vice chairman of
the caucus; Dan Glickman of Kansas; Howard Wolpe of Michigan;
Dennis Eckart and Marcy Kaptur of Ohio; Robert Torricelli of New
Jersey; Bob Wise of West Virginia; and David Nagle of Iowa.
