   Six former U.S. Marines are visiting Vietnam as
volunteers to help get rid of mines they planted more than 20 years
ago. Here is a report on their journy by George Esper, who spent 10
years covering the Vietnam War for The Associated Press and is on
his second reporting trip there since then.

   Six former U.S. Marines visited their
old battleground with a man who had been their enemy, walking
carefully to avoid unexploded mines laid more than 20 years ago.
   ``Don't go off the road. It's very dangerous. A lot of people
have been killed by mines,'' Col. Ho Minh Thanh told the Americans,
who came as volunteers to help get rid of mines they had sown as
young soldiers.
   The Americans were not carrying any equipment, but they wanted to
point out likely sites where mines may be concealed.
   As the Marines moved out on their patrol into the past, trudging
along the red dirt road of the Alpha 3 artillery base, Thanh
confirmed their suspicions that mines remained, despite assurances
by Vietnam's U.N. ambassador that all had been cleared.
   Thanh said the region he commands in central Vietnam still is
laden with dangerous, unexploded shells and many of the 100,000 land
mines planted in the late 1960s by the 11th Marines, an engineer
battalion to which five of the visitors belonged.
   ``We lost a lot of people, even children. People are still being
injured and killed,'' Thanh said during the tour Tuesday.
   At another base at Gio Linh, scores of poor women and children
hacked in the ruins with hoes and shovels despite the danger,
searching for valuable scrap metal from shell casings.
   Thanh said soldiers and civilians had tried to clear the mines
from around Alpha 3 so rubber trees could be planted, but there were
too many. He agreed with Gene Spanos, a 39-year-old police
lieutenant from Rosemont, Ill., who organized the 10-day inspection
trip, that something should be done.
   ``Can we go back and relay that information to your people in
Hanoi?'' Spanos asked the colonel. ``Would that be OK?''
   ``Thank you. We appreciate that,'' Thanh said.
   ``That's why we're here,'' said Spanos.
   The American reported to Thanh that the Pentagon told him in a
letter it had offered to help clear mines and dispose of unexploded
shells, some fired by the North Vietnamese and some by U.S. soldiers
and their South Vietnamese allies.
   ``What the response was, I don't know,'' Spanos said.
   ``Thank you very much for your good intentions,'' Thanh replied
through the interpreter who translated their remarks for each other.
   On a visit by the Americans to the Vietnamese U.N. Mission in New
York three months ago, Ambassador Trinh Xuan Lang told Spanos all
the mines had been cleared but the former Marines were welcome to
visit as tourists.
   That is how they traveled, in a van provided by the Vietnam
Tourist Bureau, unofficial goodwill ambassadors whose expenses are
being paid by an anonymous benefactor.
   ``I knew damn well not all of those mines had been taken out,''
said Nate Genna, 41, of Boston. ``We laid over 100,000 in a
relatively small region.''
   The region included a string of U.S. bases just below what was
then the demilitarized zone dividing Vietnam north and south at the
17th parallel. The country was reunited by North Vietnam's victory
in April 1975.
   ``I think there has been a reconciliation,'' Genna said. ``It's
not after every war that guys come back who actually did the work
and try to do something about it. It's a load off my mind. I had my
doubts all along. This is awful, all these years later.''
   Spanos said: ``We've accomplished everything. We found out the
Vietnamese would not let us off this road for our safety, and that
it has been confirmed by a Vietnamese commander who served in this
area who still is in the army, who is still aware and has
acknowledged that there are mines in this area and people are still
being injured, still being killed.''
   He said he would send full reports to the U.S. and Vietnamese
governments saying there are serious mine problems at three of the
four bases they visited: Alpha 3, Con Thien just to the west and Khe
Sanh, where U.S. Marines withstood a 77-day siege in 1968.
   On their visit to Khe Sanh, the former Marines were restricted to
the main road because of mines and unexploded shells.
   Spanos said his report would call attention to the dangers of Gio
Linh, the easternmost base, where the women and children risked
death for a possible prize.
   Their journey stirred memories for the Americans.
   Marines put the first protective shield of mines around Alpha 3
at Christmas 1967, said William Johnson, 41, of Manchester, Conn.
   Frank Noe, 40, of Stoughton, Mass., looked at the red dirt and
said: ``There was a lot of heavy combat at this base, as there was
at Con Thien and Gio Linh. ... We ran operations along the DMZ. A
lot of guys died up around here.''
   His voice trailed off and he he walked away to weep alone.

   Florida will not bargain with convicted
killer Theodore Bundy to delay his scheduled execution in exchange
for details of several unsolved murders in other states, Gov. Bob
Martinez said Wednesday.
   An attorney and adviser for Bundy, scheduled to be executed
Tuesday, asked for a reprieve of up to three years so Bundy could
talk to law officers. Officials from Washington state, Utah and the
FBI have asked to interview Bundy but have not sought any delay.
   Before his capture in Florida, Bundy was on the FBI's most-wanted
list as a suspect in as many as 36 sex-related murders or
disappearances of young women in the Northwest.
   The governor, who signed Bundy's death warrant Tuesday shortly
after the Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal in the 1978
murder of a 12-year-old Lake City girl, said Bundy was once again
trying to foil justice.
   ``We're not going to have the system manipulated,'' said
Martinez. ``One of the things to be made clear here to law
enforcement, which I think they realize more than anyone else what
Ted Bundy has done, is you don't negotiate with a murderer. You
don't negotiate with a killer.''
   He promised to make Bundy available to any law agency in the days
remaining before his execution.
   Bundy's civil attorney, Diana Weiner of Sarasota, told the
governor's death-penalty lawyer, Andrea Smith Hillyer, that Bundy
was committed to revealing all he knew about unsolved murders.
Weiner didn't specify about which cases he had information.
   ``Ted Bundy feels morally compelled as he faces death to do the
right thing in terms of resolving any investigations,'' she said.
``While it may satisfyingly close the book on the Florida cases, the
immediate execution will effectively cripple law enforcement
agencies around the country.''
   Martinez said he had no patience for any more appeals.
   ``He has been in jail for 11 years. He certainly could have come
clean in other occasions, but he has used the court. Now all of a
sudden, he wants to tell the truth,'' said Martinez.
   Bundy always has insisted that he is innocent of any murder.
   Bundy, 42, also is under death sentences for fatally bludgeoning
two Florida State University sorority sisters.
   Bundy's Washington attorney, James Coleman, said he's not
involved in any attempt to delay the execution by talking about
other cases, but was planning an appeal on the question of Bundy's
sanity.
   Coleman filed an emergency appeal through state Circuit Court in
Lake City, and a hearing has been scheduled for Thursday morning, a
court clerk said.
   Hillyer said Bob Keppel of the Washington state attorney
general's office planned to talk with Bundy, who is suspected in up
to 20 killings and more closely linked to eight killings in that
state.
   She added that an official from the FBI's National Center for
Violent Crime in Quantico, Va., wanted to interview Bundy.
   In Utah, Salt Lake County Sheriff Pete Hayward said he is sending
Detective Dennis Couch to Florida on Saturday in hopes of
interviewing Bundy. Hayward said he hoped Bundy, a former University
of Utah law student, could help authorities locate the bodies of any
Utah victims.
   ``He hasn't indicated he'd say a word to us, but there's always
that long shot, that last-second chance that he'll say `Ah, bring
them in, let's see what's on their minds,''' Hayward said.
   Also announced Wednesday was Bundy's decision, reversing himself,
to grant a news media interview, and Bundy's request for a personal
interview with James Dobson, host of a Pomona, Calif.,-based radio
show called ``Focus on the Family.''
   Dobson said he has exchanged letters with Bundy for the past two
years. He didn't know what Bundy might want to talk about but hoped
that if Bundy has information about any other killings he would
reveal it to help ease the victims' families.
   ``When a man is looking death in the face, he doesn't waste words
and I want to hear what he has to say,'' said Dobson, who said his
30-minute radio show is carried on 1,300 stations in 26 countries.

   About 2,500 wealthy Republican partisans,
unmindful of chanting protesters outside, feasted on a
$1,500-a-plate dinner of Maryland crab and mushroom-stuffed veal
Wednesday night and cheered George Bush's declaration that ``I'm
gonna try my level best to be a good president of the United
States.''
   The president-elect and his vice president-to-be, Dan Quayle,
toured three black-tie inaugural dinners two days before they take
the oath of office, and by the time they reached their final stop at
Union Station, Bush said, with a laugh, that ``We're exhausted.''
   Bush thanked the GOP faithful for helping him get elected Nov. 8
and for their financial support that opened the four days of
inaugural festivities to thousands of ``just plain folks.''
   ``I hope you enjoy the celebration,'' he said. ``We've earned it
together.''
   After he was toasted with champagne and serenaded by the
Whiffenpoofs, the famed glee club from his Yale University alma
mater, Bush drew a roar of approval from the crowd when he said he
would try to be a good president and ``work for all the people of
the United States.''
   Said Bush: ``You've given me a chance and I'm not going to let
you down.''
   Then Bush stepped down from the podium and shook hands with
scores of well-wishers followed by his wife, Barbara, and the
Quayles, during their half-hour appearance.
   Before the dinner started, several hundred protesters
demonstrated outside Union Station for three hours and chanted at
arriving limousines ``Food For The Poor, Not The Rich,'' and ``What
About The Homeless?''
   Inside Union Station, the black-tie guests expressed little
concern about the message the demonstraters were shouting.
   ``I feel it's ridiculous,'' said Thomas J. Stewart, a Seattle
business executive. ``They hold these staged events every time
Republicans get together and it's in very poor taste.''
   ``The people here have probably contributed more as individuals
and corporations to the welfare of this country than anybody else,''
said Tulsa, Okla., oilman Jim Hewgley. ``If they want to celebrate,
then, by God, they're entitled to.''
   Several hundred protesters demonstrated for three hours, shouting
at the limousines that pulled up to the main entrance at Union
Station with inaugural dinner guests, but dispersed peaceably as the
dinner began in mid-evening.
   Three hours before the start of the Union Station dinner, several
hundred street people enjoyed a ``counter Inaugural banquet'' of hot
chili and rice, tortilla chips, salad and apple cider on the plaza
in front of Union Station.
   While they ate off of paper plates, the homeless listened to
guitar players and watched a pro-abortion street theater featuring a
man in tennis shoes wearing a Bush mask and a sign reading, ``I
oppose abortion'' hanging around his neck.
   Protesters organized by a group called, ``The Counter-Inaugural
Coalition for a Peoples' Agenda,'' carried placards reading, ``Food,
Not Bombs,'' ``George Knew'' and ``The Skies Are for Stars, Not
War.'' Another sign under a huge peace symbol read, ``Now Appearing
In a Four-Year Show, Son of Reaganstein, co-starring Big Bird.''
   Bush and Quayle were guests of honor at the lavish dinners
attended by more than 2,500 Republican stalwarts and fat-cat
contributors. The black-tie crowd was so large the dinners were held
at Union Station and the nearby Pension Building and Corcoran
Gallery of Art.
   For $1,500 ticket, each invited guest was to hear brief remarks
by Bush and Quayle at the three dinner sites and feast on a
four-course dinner.
   Outside of Union Station, Park Police Sgt. Robert Kass banished a
half dozen conservative Republican counter-demonstrators for lack of
a permit.
   The leader of the group, Eugene Delgaudio, 34, executive director
of the private, ultra-conservative activists group known as ``Public
Advocate,'' said he wanted to show ``there's a better way than
openly, political negativism.'' He said his demonstrators were to
welcome the black-tie dinner guests with American flags and signs
reading, ``Welcome Non-Liberals.''
   Several homeless people paused between spoonfuls of chili to say
that the $2.25 million in proceeds from the inaugural dinners should
be spent to provide food, additional shelters, job training and
subsidized public transportation for Washington's street people.
   Referring to the inaugural diners, Roosevelt Carrington, a
30-year-old homeless person, said, ``I think maybe they should eat
the same thing we're having so they'll know what it's like.''
   Said Ronnie Thompson, 38: ``They done robbed most of it from
us.'' He said the inaugural dinner proceeds should be used for the
homeless because ``a lot of them have given up.''
   More than 1,000 people were served at the counter-inaugural
dinner at Union Station.
   As guests began arriving shortly before 7 p.m., several hundred
of the people at the counter-inaugural banquet began shouting,
``What about the homeless'' and ``50,000 dead from AIDS. Where was
George?''
   Although the Park Police allowed the demonstration to spread
closer to the train depot than the demonstrators' permit allowed,
the protestors remained 100 yards from the entrance where the
invited guests were emerging from their cars and were barely audible
from that distance.
   At about 7:30 p.m., one half hour before the Union Station
banquet would get officially underway, the Park Police received
reinforcement and barricades which were set up in front of the
demonstrators.
   Park Police Sgt. G. F. Wallace, asked whether the barricades had
been planned in advance, said, ``I'm not in on these decisions, but
I imagine it was spontaneous because of the crowd's activity...we
can't have the police spread out or people can sneak through. We
should have had them up there before.''
   There was no indication that any of the invited guests to the
Union Station dinner were even aware of the demonstration. None of
them came over to see what is going on.
   At the majestic Corcoran Gallery of Art, dinner guests who also
paid $1,500 each were serenaded up a royal blue carpeted stairway by
violins playing, ``This Could Be The Start of Something Big.''
   Elegantly attired guests wandered through art displays ranging
from modern neon art to traditional American pieces. The gallery was
hung with blue bunting with white stars and large arrangements of
red roses decorated the corridors.
   Among the guests at the Corcoran gala dinner were Bush's longtime
friend and Commerce secretary-designate, Robert Mosbacher of Texas,
and Mosbacher's socialite wife Georgette. Mrs. Mosbacher, like Mrs.
Bush and Mrs. Quayle was dressed in a black-and-white gown.
   Also among the guests were Sen. John Warner, R-Va., and Bush's
son, Marvin, and his wife, Margaret. The younger Bush said he was
having fun, but mostly waiting for Friday's swearing in of his
father.
   ``The rest will be fun,'' he said, adding, however, ``the one we
will all be looking forward to will be Friday - an incredibly proud
moment for all of us.''
   His wife, who wore a fitted, strapless black gown with a brocade
bodice, said she had never seen George and Barbara Bush so excited
as they have been with the inauguration approaching. ``They're like
two kids,'' she said.

   Once a little city with clean, if rainy, skies and
clear mountain views, fast-growing Seattle has become a metropolis
with the usual smog and traffic jams. Some people are starting to
protest.
   A citizens group turned in 18,000 signatures on an initiative to
limit the height and density of downtown buildings, and debate is
gearing up before a vote this spring.
   The building boom is easy to see, and much of it has occurred in
the past decade. Three skyscrapers are under construction, and
permit applications for three more were submitted before a recently
imposed six-month moratorium on downtown growth.
   The 55-story Washington Mutual Tower was completed last year,
bumping the 50-story 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza to third tallest. No.
1 is the West Coast's tallest building, the 76-story black-glass
Columbia Seafirst Center built in 1985, before downtown zoning went
into effect. A dozen office towers are 30 stories or more, and all
but three were opened in the 1980s.
   The thousands of workers in these buildings, plus tourists and
shoppers, make downtown Seattle a lively place.
   Fishmongers, farmers' stalls, crafts booths and restaurants
compete shoulder-to-shoulder at the historic, hectic Pike Place
Market.
   Redevelopment is continuing at the downtown waterfront. And the
downtown retail core, with major flagship department stores and a
variety of small businesses, recently settled one 30-year-old
land-use debate with the opening of Westlake Center, a new mall of
expensive shops and a 24-story office tower.
   Supporters of the Citizens Alternative Plan to Downtown
Development, or CAP, say overdevelopment in downtown will mean more
pollution as more people commute by car and more box-like apartment
buildings replace single-family houses and dilute the flavor of old
city neighborhoods.
   CAP wants to limit building height to about 40 stories in the
office district. New office floor space would be limited to 500,000
square feet a year for the next five years and 1 million square feet
a year from 1995 through 1999. After that, the ceiling would be
lifted unless re-imposed by the City Council.
   By contrast, nearly 6 million square feet of downtown office
space is newly completed, under construction or has received city
permits, said Virginia Galle, a City Council member and CAP
supporter.
   At the present rate of growth, in 10 years some 67,000 new office
workers are expected to occupy 52,000 new households and make 29,000
more car trips daily into downtown, she said.
   There is no height limit under the city's current zoning plan. A
building's size is worked out according to a formula based on the
size of the site, with extra height allowed in exchange for such
amenities as plazas, retail space and day care centers.
   CAP supporters insist they want growth, but not at a high cost to
the environment and the neighborhoods.
   ``We're not anti-growth in the traditional sense,'' says Patrick
Strosahl, a jeweler and president of Vision Seattle, which supports
CAP. ``We're really much more into shaping growth so that it
produces and accentuates the livability of the city.''
   Some participants in the growth debate argue the city needs
controls that are more lenient than the CAP initiative.
   Mayor Charles Royer presented a plan of his own that would limit
office towers to about 50 stories. It would stiffen the zoning code,
but not as much as CAP would.
   Royer also wants to adjust the bonus system used to allow
developers to build higher. His plan would shift the emphasis of the
bonuses from street-level amenities to housing, human services and
open space.
   The Downtown Seattle Association, a group of developers and
business executives, contends the 1985 zoning law is strict enough.
   John Gilmore, president of the association, says downtown growth
makes more sense than spreading development into neighborhods and
suburbs. A downtown provides a focal point for a rapid-transit
system, something Seattle needs, he said. And Seattle must grow, he
contended. ``We're having childen like every other part of the
country and there's got to be jobs.''
   Folke Nyberg, a professor of urban planning and architecture at
the University of Washington, agreed Seattle's location on the
Pacific Rim means it will grow, but disagreed that concentrated
downtown growth is good.
   Seattle has an ``hour-glass'' figure, squeezed between Puget
Sound and Lake Washington, he said. ``So there are some very limited
physical constraints that makes it imperative that we have an
effective transportation solution before we allow growth to happen,
and this was not done.''
   A better way to grow, Nyberg said, would be in decentralized
clusters throughout the region. People in these smaller cities would
live near their jobs and go to downtown Seattle mainly for
conventions and cultural events.
   Instead, unplanned growth can be seen in declining air quality,
traffic congestion and more homelessness caused by a lack of
afforable housing, he said.
   Seattle, which ``has been a very livable city,'' he said, failed
to learn from other cities' mistakes. Asked why, he replied, ``It's
all greed.''
   The growth-control initiative goes before voters May 16, the City
Council decided last week.
   Gilmore, of the Downtown Seattle Association, said that the
city's 1985 downtown zoning was the product of four years of debate
and that any changes should be made through more hearings and City
Council votes. The American Institute of Architects' local chapter
agrees.
   CAP supporters, however, say their plan is reasonable and timely.
   According to Strosahl, San Francisco needed to enact stiffer
downtown limits in 1986 because it waited too long, until the cost
of housing went way up and the character of the city changed.
   San Francisco voters approved the limits after a building spree
in which 25 million square feet of office space was added between
1979 and 1984. The high rises nearly blocked out all the sun in San
Francisco's financial district.
   San Francisco's voter-approved plan limits new office space to
475,000 square feet for several years for a city with a population
of 690,000. That compares with CAP's limits of 500,000 square feet
for five years and 1 million square feet for the next five in a city
of 490,000.
   Gilmore suggests people who signed CAP did not really want to
limit growth, but were just annoyed with traffic disruption downtown
caused by construction of a downtown bus tunnel and a state
convention center. The initiative text was long and complicated, and
people probably did not read it, he said.
   What's more, the petition had just 329 more signatures than it
needed.
   Strosahl thinks voters will pass the initiative, but he expects a
highly financed campaign against it.

<TEXT>
   The sinking New Year's Eve of an
overcrowded tourist boat off Rio de Janeiro has sparked a nationwide
outcry against what many Brazilians feel is the impunity of the rich
and powerful and a general disrespect for law.
   In public demonstrations, Brazilians have made the tragedy, in
which 52 passengers and crew died, a forum to rail against a
widespread sense that in Brazil people in the right places can get
away with lawbreaking _ from running red lights to hiring
professional killers.
   ``Some of the worst vices of the Brazilian soul came to light the
moment the boat sank: facility to bribe, irresponsibility and the
failure to assist fellow citizens in trouble,'' the newspaper Jornal
do Brasil of Rio de Janeiro said in an editorial.
   There has been no accurate count of the number of revelers on the
Bateau Mouche when it capsized and sank on its way to an annual
fireworks display off Copacabana beach. A widely accepted figure is
150.
   The flat-bottomed river boat was built to carry 20 passengers.
Survivors claim it was dangerously overcrowded and listing badly in
rough water and that lifejackets were not readily accessible.
   There are accusations _ as yet unproved _ that Port Authority
guards who inspected the Bateau Mouche just two hours before it went
down were paid off to allow it to venture into the open sea.
   The navy and the police are bickering over which group should
investigate the sinking. There is widespread fear that no one will
be held responsible _ as happened so often before here in Latin
America's largest country, in highway and maritime tragedies, fires
and collapses of buildings and freeways.
   In 1981, for example, two riverboat sinkings in Amazon waters
claimed about 500 lives. Both resulted from overcrowding, yet no one
was ever prosecuted.
   ``The sinking of the Bateau Mouche is a portrait of our
reality,'' political commentator Alexandre Garcia said in a
syndicated newspaper column. ``We were already irresponsible, now we
are becoming inhuman.''
   ``There is a cultural tradition of disregarding security norms,
of negligence,'' said Evaristo de Moraes, a lawyer for the owners of
the Bateau Mouche. ``We need to look at our mentality, which
believes that laws are always flexible.''
   De Moraes added, however, that in the case of the boat disaster,
``I am convinced my clients had no responsibility whatsoever.''
   Indeed, one of the owners of the boat initially told reporters
that ``panic among the passengers'' was the cause of the tragedy.
   Paulo Soares, a son-in-law of the Bateau Mouche's 50-year-old
captain, Camilo da Costa, who drowned, told the AP, ``Camilo didn't
want to go out. He called us to say the boat was overloaded and the
sea was too rough. But he had no choice. He would lose his job if he
didn't sail.''
   Brazilians are proud of what they call ``jeitinho,'' or a
``little way'' of cutting through red tape, avoiding a traffic
ticket or eliminating a problem that has become intertwined with
self-definitions of national character. There is a whole
professional category known as ``despachantes,'' whose job consists
basically of paying off the right people.
   A recent prime-time TV soap opera, ``Vale Tudo (Anything Goes),
drew ratings of 80 percent with its portrayals of greed, conniving,
corruption and deceit among it principal characters.
   But it isn't exclusively a lack of respect for laws that has
generated a sense of impunity in Brazil, said Deputy Justice
Minister Luis Eichenberg.
   ``This also has grown from a tremendous lack of human and
material resources,'' he said. ``We often are physically and
financially unable to enforce the law.''
   Many Brazilians are determined that the Bateau Mouche case not be
forgotten. Theater and movie personalities _ outraged by the
drowning of the well-known actress Yara Amaral _ along with Rio city
councilmen and other well known figures have organized to demand
that police determine responsibility in the sinking.
   Brazilians also have rallied around the shooting death in
December of the internationally known ecologist Francisco Mendes,
who sought to defend the Amazon's ecology and its poor peasants
against the interests of powerful landowners. Many employ private

   According to Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, about 1,000 peasants, ecologists and Roman Catholic
priests, who defend landless farmers, have been killed in land
disputes in Brazil since 1980. Only three cases have been
prosecuted, the organization says.

   President Reagan returns to his beloved
California as the toast of Hollywood, reinvigorating the social
scene with the stature of a popular two-term president who never
forgot his show business past.
   Ronald and Nancy Reagan don't hide their eagerness to step out of
the national spotlight and re-enter a private world among friends.
The president has said: ``Every time I come home I say to myself,
`Why did I ever leave?'''
   Their affluent friends are no less eager.
   ``It's tough to beat a former president living in your midst.
They are now going to be the superstars in the Bel-Air circuit,''
entertainment industry observer Army Archerd said.
   ``Hollywood feels it sent one of its own to the White House and
now he's returned as the most popular president in history. He's one
of us,'' said TV producer Gregory Willenborg.
   Merv Griffin and Barron Hilton set the social tone by throwing a
$25,000-a-table homecoming gala earlier this month.
   The Reagans will be a star attraction Feb. 23 at the America's
Hope Award presentations honoring Elizabeth Taylor and a Valentine's
Day party is on tap for Mrs. Reagan.
   ``They will really re-invigorate things,'' dance man Donald
O'Connor predicted. Griffin said the social calendar is already
topsy-turvy. ``I'm sure they will be the leaders of everything that
happens here,'' he said.
   Reagan never forgot Hollywood, where he starred in motion
pictures and led the Screen Actors Guild. Throughout his eight years
in the White House he delighted in spinning show business yarns.
   There are those who hope Reagan's fondness for his old vocation
will lead him back to the screen. Actress Joan Collins said a script
has been written for Reagan to play her ex-husband on ``Dynasty'' if
he chooses, and Griffin suggested the Reagans might make a movie
together.
   But one longtime Reagan friend said television and movies aren't
part of the Reagan post-presidential agenda.
   ``I think the idea of him being interested in an acting career is
absurd,'' said the Reagan confidant, who spoke on condition that his
name be withheld. ``I don't think he will do anything in
entertainment.''
   However, the same source said the nation may hear Reagan on
Saturday morning radio again, expressing his thoughts and opinions
on issues facing the country.
   Reagan expects to be inundated with requests to make speeches on
``the mashed-potato circuit'' and has offered himself up as a foot
soldier in what he calls the Bush Brigade of his successor's
supporters.
   He and Mrs. Reagan also have plans to write memoirs and push
their pet causes.
   Not everyone is happy the Reagans are back in town. Residents of
Lake View Terrace, 20 miles north of Los Angeles, have been fighting
to keep the Nancy Reagan Center for drug rehabilitation out of their
neighborhood.
   Homeowners fear the center, an extension of Mrs. Reagan's ``Just
Say No'' anti-drug crusade, will bring addicts into the area and
endanger residents. During the recent Beverly Hills welcome-home
gala, which raised $1 million for the center, residents marched
outside with signs reading, ``If you really care, put it in
Bel-Air.''
   That affluent hillside enclave is the Reagan's new neighborhood.
Although they are keeping their Santa Barbara ranch as a retreat,
they intend to spend most of their time in their new $2.5 million
Bel-Air home.
   Perched in hills among $10 million-plus mansions, the
6,500-square-foot ranch-style home is modest by neighborhood
standards.
   Little can be seen behind an electronic iron gate leading to 668
Saint Cloud Rd. A guard shack was constructed recently, a chain link
fence was thrown up over vintage stone walls and roof-mounted
cameras scan the property.
   The address was changed last summer from 666 Saint Cloud because
of connotations surrounding the number 666, believed by some to be
the symbol of the devil.
   Tourists clutching $5 maps to stars' homes ply the winding roads
aboard tour vans or in rental cars. So far, little notice has been
paid to the Reagan house _ the real stars are the ``Beverly
Hillbillies'' mansion and the home of entertainer Zsa Zsa Gabor.

<TEXT>
   West Germany has lengthened its
compulsory military service from 15 months to 18 months, a move the
opposition Social Democrats say could jeopardize East-West
disarmament efforts.
   Following Tuesday's announcement by the Defense Ministry, the
Free Democrats, a minority party in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
coalition government, also expressed reservations and asked that the
move be delayed.
   Given that about 400,000 more draft-age men than needed are now
available, the opposition says extending service time is unnecessary.
   The Social Democrats also point to a lessened threat from the
East bloc. The armed forces now have about 495,000 members. Men aged
18 through 28 are subject to be drafted and about half of those in
service are draftees.

   By the 1970s his holdings ranged from farm, cattle, oil, gas and
nursery operations to control of six banks, stock in other banks and
land sales entimated at $1 million a month. Although he had sold his
bank holdings, Bentsen continued farming, running 5,000 head of

chairman of Sperry Corp., died Sunday. The cause of death had not
been determined as of Tuesday.
   Probst joined the Air Force in 1942 and commanded a B-24 bomber
in World War II missions over Europe. He was awarded the
distinguished flying cross and the air medal with three oak leaf

decade, being promoted to a divisional presidency in 1971.
   Probst became corporate vice president in 1974, executive vice
president in 1975, and company president in 1980. He was elected
chairman of the board of Sperry in 1982.
   Probst was named chairman and chief executive officer of Sperry
in September 1986 when the $5 billion computer and defense systems
company merged with Burroughs Corp. to form Uinsys. He retired a few
months later but continued to serve as a member of Uinsys

   George Tweed, a World War II Navy
radioman who eluded Japanese forces on the Pacific island of Guam
for more than two years and became the subject of a movie, died
Monday in a car accident in Northern California at age 86.
   When Japanese forces overran Guam in 1941, Tweed and several
others slipped into the jungle rather than surrender. He became the
lone survivor after the others were captured and killed.
   Tweed managed to elude Japanese soldiers for two years and seven
months, providing information to American forces that recaptured the
island in 1944. He was awarded the Legion of Merit.
   His story was told in the book ``Robinson Crusoe USN,'' and the

   A blackbird confused by Britain's unseasonably mild
winter is raising a family in a Christmas tree outside a department
store _ two months out of season.
   ``From the size of the chicks it looks as though the mother must
have laid its eggs on Christmas Day,'' said Adam Hands, assistant
general manager of the store in Cheltenham, western England.
   ``The tree will stay until the young are able to fly.''
   London's Evening Standard newspaper ran photographs on Tuesday of
the nest and its three chicks, the parent and the tree on a balcony
under the headline, ``Early bird catches the warm.''
   Meteorologists say high pressure over southern England is forming
a barrier to Europe's chills.
   Wildlife watchers report hedgehogs refusing to hibernate, frogs
starting to spawn in waters that usually would be frozen, and
migrant birds like warblers staying on.

   A bill that got its first reading Tuesday by South Lake Tahoe

   The measure would let the party-thrower be charged up to $500.
   Council member Neva Roberts voiced the only opposition to the
measure, saying the city already has laws to deal with disturbing
the peace and adding that she thinks there are people who will
complain even when a party isn't loud enough to warrant it.
   Besides, she asked, ``What fun is a party with no noise, anyway?''
   The ordinance is scheduled for a second reading Feb. 7. If
approved then, it will become law 30 days later.

   The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Tuesday
reversed a $390,000 judgment won by a woman who was publicly branded
by her church for having sex outside of marriage.
   But the court left open the possibility that the woman could
recover damages for actions taken by church elders after she sought
to withdraw from membership in the church.
   The Oklahoma court ruled Marian Guinn could not recover for any
civil wrongs committed against her by church elders while she was
still a member of the Collinsville Church of Christ.
   Justice Marian Opala wrote the majority opinion sending the case
back for a new trial. Four other justices concurred, two dissented
and two others dissented in part.
   Opala's opinion held that the First Amendment did not protect
church elders from potential liability for acts that occurred after
the woman withdrew her church membership.
   The decision said it could be found that the elders went ``beyond
the bounds of decency'' by going against the woman's wishes and
announcing to the congregation the woman's ``sin of fornication''
when she declined to publicly repent.
   ``We hence hold there is competent evidence to support the jury's
conclusion that the elders had intended to inflict emotional harm on
parishioner,'' the opinion said.
   Elders of the Collinsville church, located north of Tulsa in
northeast Oklahoma, filed the appeal after a Tulsa County jury in
March 1984 awarded Ms. Guinn $205,000 actual damages and $185,000
punitive damages.
   The registered nurse and divorced mother of four sued in 1981,
when elders of the church disclosed she had committed the ``sin of
fornication.''
   The church argued elders had a right, outlined in the Bible, to
discipline members.
   The elders were identified in the Supreme Court ruling as Ron
Whitten, Ted Moody and Allen Cash.
   The court said the woman had implored the elders in a letter not
to mention her name in church, except to say she had withdrawn from
membership.
   The elders told the woman that withdrawing from the church was
not possible and could not halt disciplinary action against her.

   Actor Karl Malden says he hurt his
Yugoslav immigrant parents when he changed his name from Mladen
Sekulovich, and his efforts to put the family name into his work
haven't always helped, either.
   ``I think I hurt my folks when I dropped `Sekulovich,''' he said.
``They were proud people. And if you've noticed in my films and TV
series in the past eight years, you'll know that somehow I've worked
in the name `Sekulovich.'''
   Malden has appeared in films such as ``On the Waterfront'' and
``Patton,'' and in the TV series ``Streets of San Francisco.''
   ``I couldn't figure how to get it in in one show where there was
a row of cells with each prisoner's name above the door. I had them
put `Sekulovich' on one. My father called me up and said
indignantly, `Son, no Sekulovich was ever in prison!'''
   Malden, who is teaching acting classes at Vanderbilt University
for two weeks, took the name Karl from his maternal grandfather and
came up with Malden by rearranging ``Mladen.''

   Songwriter Arnold Lanni had few expectations when

``All of a sudden my past is paying dividends.''
   The song was a modest success in Canada while Sheriff was

   Harry Edwards, who is advising major
league baseball on how to recruit more blacks for high-level jobs,
is suing the St. Louis Post-Dispatch for allegedly putting his
byline on a story he didn't write.
   Edwards, a University of California-Berkeley sociology professor,
is seeking $1.2 million in damages in the suit filed last Thursday
in Alameda County Superior Court.
   Post-Dispatch Managing Editor David Lipman said Tuesday he had
not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it.
   Edwards claims the Jan. 4 article was written by a Post-Dispatch
sports writer who interviewed him in July 1987. He contends the
story misquoted him and misrepresented his feelings about conditions
facing U.S. blacks.
   The suit said the article contained statements such as,
``Ninety-nine percent of murders are black people killing black
people,'' and ``America cannot carry 30 million dispossessed,
deprived and disenchanted black people on its back.''
   The newspaper ran an editor's note after the article appeared
saying the use of Edwards' byline was misleading but standing behind
the accuracy of the contents.

   The 26-year-old drifter with a long criminal
record who launched a mute, murderous assault on a California
elementary school Tuesday was described by his aunt as a loner and
childhood alcoholic, police said.
   Patrick E. Purdy purchased an AK-47 rifle in this Portland suburb
several months ago, then returned to his hometown of Stockton,
Calif., where he used the gun to kill five children and wound 29
others, along with a teacher, at Cleveland Elementary School before
taking his own life, authorities said.
   Purdy, who went by the alias of Patrick West, had lived with an
aunt and uncle in Sandy from the first of July until late October,
said Sandy Police Chief Fred Punzel. He later moved to Lodi, Calif.,
where he listed his mailing address under the name of his
grandmother, Julia Chumbley, although he did not live with her,
authorities said.
   ``I'm shocked. It's just horrible. I don't understand why and I
probably won't ever know why,'' said Ms. Chumbley, a 63-year-old
retired cannery worker.
   ``It troubles me to think that such a terrible thing can happen.
It's like a nightmare. This sort of thing happens to others, not
you. Your own grandson.''
   Stockton is about 15 miles southwest of Lodi.
   Punzel said Purdy's aunt, Julie Michael, ``told me he was a loner
and as a child he was an alcoholic.''
   Mrs. Michael said through a closed front door at her residence
that she was too upset to talk to reporters.
   Her next-door neighbor, Pat Thomas, 45, said she met West when he
lived with his relatives last summer.
   ``He seemed like a real nice young man,'' she said. ``He was here
looking for work.''
   However, Purdy had an ``extensive criminal history,'' mostly in
the Los Angeles area, said Lucian Neely, deputy police chief in
Stockton, an agricultural city 60 miles east of San Francisco.
   Purdy had no criminal record in Sandy, Clackamas County or
Portland, authorities said.
   Neely said Purdy originally was from Stockton and that he had
purchased the gun at the Sandy Trading Post Aug. 3.
   Punzel said Mrs. Michael told him Purdy left Oregon for a job as
a boilermaker in Texas. That job fell through and he went to
Memphis, Tenn.
   The aunt and uncle last heard from Purdy at Thanksgiving, when he
was in Connecticut, Punzel said.
   His mother lives in Sacramento, Calif., and his father was killed
in 1980 or 1981 when he was struck by a car as a pedestrian, Punzel
said.
   State Division of Motor Vehicles records identify Purdy as
5-foot-11, 150 pounds, with blue eyes and blond hair, said spokesman
Dave Davis.

   Looting and vandalism spread Tuesday and eight
people were shot, one fatally, in the second day of rioting sparked
by the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorcyclist by a white
policeman.
   Schools were closed, a professional basketball game was canceled,
and some fans were stranded in the arena. Snipers fired at police,
who cordoned off a 130-block area of the predominantly black
Overtown neighborhood.
   After nightfall, authorities told law-abiding citizens to remain
indoors and began a block-by-blok sweep.
   ``For the sake of our city, I appeal to every citizen regardless
of race to stay calm, get off the streets and stay in your homes,
said Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez in a televised appeal Tuesday night.
   ``We are arresting people and we are being a lot more aggressive
in the enforcement of the law and I think we have to be,'' Suarez
added. ``I don't think this will continue after today.''
   Authorities said Overtown, just north of downtown, was largely
quiet after police entered. By 11:30 p.m., about 150 people had been
arrested, mostly for looting.
   But the violence already had spread to Liberty City, a separate
black community several miles to the northwest, where looting and
gunfire continued Tuesday night.
   Police said they made an arrest in the fatal shooting of a young
black man in Liberty City at 10:20 p.m., but hadn't determined if it
was related to the rioting.
   Officer Eric Butler, wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the
vest at 9:30 p.m. by a sniper who was later arrested on top of a
three-story building. Butler was not seriously injured.
   Plans were made for up to 500 National Guard troops to be
mobilized within two hours if the violence continued, said Brian
Ballard, a spokesman for Gov. Bob Martinez.
   Top police officials said the tough stance would not bring a
violent reaction because only a few people were violating the law.
   Trouble erupted again Tuesday afternoon when a white man in a
luxury car reportedly fired into a crowd of blacks in the area,
wounding one person before driving away.
   ``All I know is that one person was hit in the side,'' police
spokesman Angelo Bitsis said, adding that the unidentified victim
was hospitalized in fair condition.
   Sporadic gunfire continued throughout the day. Police said
officers rescued one shooting victim while under fire, returned fire
at another man, injuring him in the leg, and shot an alleged sniper
in the leg.
   Another man was shot in the thigh in a gun battle between two men
in a store and a gang of looters. Later, a man with a bullet wound
in his leg was arrested when he showed up at a hospital for
treatment. An eighth person was shot in the leg in Liberty City.
   About 25 youths shattered car windows outside the Miami Arena on
the border of Overtown, where the National Basketball Association's
Miami Heat was scheduled to play the Phoenix Suns Tuesday night. The
game was canceled.
   A meat truck was looted and one white motorist was beaten after
his car broke down in Overtown.
   The car of Associated Press photographer Mark Pesetsky was burned
and he was roughed up by a mob but not seriously hurt when he
attempted to take pictures of the crowd that had gathered near the
site of Tuesday's shooting.
   Police fired tear gas at the crowd and in turn were pelted by
rocks and bottles. They then sealed off a several block area and
shots could be heard from within.
   ``I saw someone coming around a building and throwing rocks, and
I said `Let's go, get out of here,''' Pesetsky said. At least one
car also was burned in Liberty City.
   The FBI announced that it would open an investigation into Monday
night's shooting to determine whether there were civil rights
violations, Miami bureau spokesman George Kiszynski said.
   ``I can't tell you how long it will take, but it will be an
extensive and thorough investigation and it will be done as promptly
as possible,'' Kiszynski said.
   Meanwhile, a passenger on the motorcycle who was injured when the
driver crashed into a car after the shooting died Tuesday at Jackson
Memorial Hospital of massive head injuries, spokeswoman Betty
Baderman said.
   Suarez, one of the targets of rock and bottle throwing Monday
night, spent Tuesday meeting with black leaders and residents of
Overtown, a neighborhood of rundown, low-slung apartment buildings
and trash-strewn vacant lots, just north of downtown Miami.
   ``People are angry, people want a full explanation of what
happened,'' said Suarez, who also expressed particular concern about
the damage to Miami's image less than a week before the city is host
to the Super Bowl.
   At least two buildings and three cars were burned in the rioting,
which broke out about two hours after a white police officer shot
and killed a black motorcyclist being chased for a traffic
infraction. No damage estimates were available.
   Authorities said seven civilians and three of the 280 police
officers called to the scene were injured.
   Police guarded a 130-block area of Overtown on Tuesday, warning
motorists who passed through that they could not be guaranteed
protection. Six schools were closed and some buses were rerouted,
but authorities refused to declare an evening curfew.
   The disturbance recalled the bloody 1980 riot in adjacent Liberty
City that also was linked to the death of a black motorcyclist at
the hands of white officers. A similar disturbance broke out in 1982
when a black man was shot to death only a few blocks from where the
latest incident began.
   On Monday, Clement Lloyd, 23, died following a police chase that
started just after 6 p.m.
   Bitsis said Lloyd and a passenger on his motorcycle sped past a
police officer, who gave chase. Then the motorcycle headed down a
street where another officer, William Lozano, was taking a report
from a crime victim.
   ``He heard the radio transmission and saw the motorcycle coming
in his direction,'' Bitsis said. ``As the motorcycle either
approached him or went by him, he fired his shot.''
   The bullet hit Lloyd in the head, killing him, and the motorcycle
then crashed into a car. Allen Blanchard, 24, a passenger on the
motorcycle, died Tuesday.
   By 8 p.m. an angry crowd had surrounded the police and news media
vehicles gathered at the spot, and the violence began, with rocks
and bottles thrown at police, reporters and their cars.
   Crowds of up to 100 people roamed the streets, smashing
windshields, burning vehicles, looting some stores and occasionally
firing weapons at police.
   Lozano, 29, a four-year veteran of the force, was automatically
suspended with pay pending an investigation into whether he used
excessive force.
   Many in Miami's black community said they were tired of police
violence, saying nothing has changed despite promises by Suarez and
other officials who courted black votes.
   Suarez strongly denied that the attention paid to newly arriving
Nicaraguan refugees had created ill-will in the black community, but
black leaders did not agree.
   ``In this tremendous influx of refugees from Central and South
America, the African-Americans have felt cheated. We felt we were
losing our place in the city,'' said Johnnie McMillian, president of
the Miami-Dade branch of the NAACP.
   The scene of Monday's disturbance was about 15 miles from Joe
Robbie Stadium, site of the Super Bowl.
   But the Cincinnati Bengals are staying less than a mile away, at
the Omni Hotel.

<HEAD>Easy To Purchase AK-47 in Oregon, California</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS gunman's name to Purdy in 2nd graf and fixes style
on semiautomatic, without hyphen; adds one graf on cost of the gun in Los
Angeles area.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A semiautomatic rifle such as the AK-47 that
was used in the Stockton, Calif., school shootings Tuesday can be
easily purchased at Oregon gun stores _ without even the waiting
period required to buy a handgun.
   The gunman, identified by police as Patrick Purdy, had bought the
rifle from the Sandy Trading Post on Aug. 3, according to Sandy
Police Chief Fred Punzel. Authorities say Purdy opened fire in an
elementary school yard, killing five youngsters and wounding 30
people before killing himself.
   Bob Imel, owner of PAWS gun shop in Salem, said there is no
waiting period under Oregon law to buy rifles or shotguns, unless
they are fully automatic. There is a five-day wait to buy a handgun,
while police agencies check for criminal records.
   A buyer is required to sign a form issued by the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The form requires the buyer to
provide identification and attest that he is not under indictment,
has not been convicted of a crime punishable by more than a year in
prison and is not a fugitive from justice.
   A buyer also must attest that he is not an unlawful user of
narcotics, has not been found mentally defective or been committed
to a mental instutition, has not been discharged dishonorably from
the armed forces, is not an illegal alien and has not renounced U.S.
citizenship.
   People must be at least 18 to purchase rifles and shotguns and 21
to buy handguns. There are some other requirements, including that a
prospective buyer not have been adjudged mentally ill or be an
ex-convict, Imel said.
   Purchases of automatic weapons are more complicated, he said,
because federal law requires extensive background checks and
registration of the weapons. The procedure usually takes several
months before a buyer can receive the gun, Imel said.
   In California, anyone can purchase a semiautomatic weapon by
completing a form and showing a driver's license or other proof of
residency in the state.
   California Deputy Attorney General Alan Ashby said that even in
legal semiautomatic condition, an AK-47 can fire at a rate of 400
rounds per minute, and that conversion to automatic firing, while
illegal, is relatively easy on many semiautomatic models.
   Sales of the Soviet-designed AK-47s have become intensely
controversial in California because of their use by the increasingly
violent street gangs in Los Angeles and other communities.
   In the Los Angeles area, models of the AK-47 that have been
manufactured in China sell from $299 to $329 at sporting goods
stores, and are often advertised on sale.

<HEAD>`Rain Man' and `Twins' Remain At Top</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brotherly sagas ``Rain Man'' and ``Twins''
maintained the top two positions in box office receipts for the
fifth consecutive weekend.
   ``Rain Man,'' starring Dustin Hoffman as an autistic savant
kidnapped by his brother, portrayed by Tom Cruise, was No. 1 last
weekend with $10.1 million in ticket sales. ``Twins,'' with Danny
DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger as reunited twins who had been
separated at birth, brought in $6.7 million.
   It was the third straight weekend that the films finished in that
order. The previous two weekends, ``Twins'' finished ahead of ``Rain
Man.''
   ``Beaches,'' starring Better Midler and Barbara Hershey as two
women with an inseparable friendship, earned $5.1 million for third
place last weekend as Disney widened its distribution.
   In fourth place was ``Accidental Tourist,'' earning $4.8 million,
followed by ``Working Girl'' with $4.5 million.
   ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad'' earned $4.4
million in its seventh week of release.
   ``Mississippi Burning,'' a fictionalized account of two FBI
agents investigating the real slaying of three civil rights workers
in the South during the 1960s, also went to wider distribution last
weekend and took seventh place with just over $4 million.
   ``Deep Star Six,'' about a giant crab that devours undersea
explorers, made a weak debut in eighth with $3.3 million.
   ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels'' was next with just over $3 million
and ``Oliver and Co.'' with $1.9 million.
   No major releases were announced for this week, with theater
owners anticipating the usual poor box office during Super Bowl
weekend, said Exhibitor Relations Co. chief John Krier.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Rain Man,'' MGM-UA, $10.1 million, 1,482 screens, $6,823 per
screen, $69 million, five weeks.

<HEAD>Time for Goodbyes for Reagan Veterans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Through her window, she can see the tourists on
Pennsylvania Avenue gawking through the wrought-iron fence at the
White House. She can scan the stream of visitors arriving to see the
president. She sits at the center of a universe of prime ministers,
senators and heroic warriors who will headline the evening news.
   For only one more day, Leslye Arsht will sit in the little
cubicle in the West Wing of the White House, dealing with the
affairs of _ and sometimes speaking for _ the president of the
United States. Then, at the stroke of 12 on Friday, she turns in her
pass and is out.
   ``There's life after the White House,'' says Ms. Arsht, her voice
the least bit uncertain.
   In Washington, a company town if there ever was one, 4,307 Reagan
administration jobs are up for grabs. Some who hold those jobs will
stay where they are, but many more, like Leslye Arsht, find
themselves on the job market.
   It is the friendliest of takeovers, this quadrennial rite,
compared to the agony that occurs when a Democrat turns the White
House over to a Republican, or vice versa. Not for 156 years has a
president handed the reins to the man who served him as vice
president.
   Yet, while the Bushites aren't exactly storming the gates, it's a
traumatic time for many.
   As Ronald Reagan flies off into the sunset, he leaves behind many
loyal workers who wonder why they are suddenly out, while others
stay on. The answer, of course, is that people work hard in a
campaign, and the jobs that serve as rewards are in great demand.
   ``We had our turn; now it's their turn,'' says Ms. Arsht, who
came from the Commerce Department two years ago with Marlin
Fitzwater when he became Reagan's spokesman. She has been deputy
press secretary, a job that will go to Bush spokesman Steve Hart.
   ``I'm a Texan, a lifetime supporter of George Bush,'' she says.
``It's a bittersweet time.''
   Outside her door in the White House press office is a huge box
being filled with files for the National Archives. The work of the
press office goes on, but it's obvious that things are being readied
for the big change.
   On Friday, the rooms will be mostly empty, the cupboards bare,
the walls nude. It won't be as stark as, say, when Jimmy Carter left
town eight years ago, because Fitzwater will stay on to serve Bush
as chief spokesman.
   In one part of the office, a cardboard box is marked ``Do not
throw away. This is not trash.'' In the hallway, a photo gallery
that has been dominated by pictures of Ron and Nancy Reagan has
undergone a subtle turn: The pictures of the Reagans have been
augmented by photos of Reagan and Bush.
   One of those who is leaving is Connie Gerrard, the closest thing
the White House has to an institutional memory. Ms. Gerrard came
into the White House 25 years ago with Lyndon Johnson, as a
fresh-from-college secretary after the assassination of John F.
Kennedy.
   She has stayed, serving as the press secretary's secretary,
through Nixon, Carter, Ford and Reagan, and she is ready to live a
life without the endless workdays and the constant crises.
   ``I now want to be able to control my own schedule,'' she says.
She knows what the incoming Bush staffers will soon learn, that ``in
the press office, you have to hit the ground running. There is
nothing to prepare you for what you find when you get here.''
   Indeed, reporters were pressing Fitzwater on Tuesday about where
they will get information after noon on Friday. Fitzwater and B. Jay
Cooper will be the only veteran hands remaining in the Bush
administration.
   The rest of the press office staff will come from the Bush team.
Many of them will see the inside of the office for the first time
when they come to work on inauguration day.
   ``It's a matter of sensitivity,'' Cooper says. ``Nobody wants to
have the new person watching over their shoulder.''
   Many of the people leaving spent the weekend packing their own
belongings. Reagan, too, was seen by Fitzwater last week putting
some things into a box.
   ``The president and first lady have been packing for some time,''
Fitzwater said. ``They have shipped most of their private goods to
California already.'''

<HEAD>Soviets, Chinese Make US Wheat Purchase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private exporters have new orders for 530,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat from the Soviet Union and 200,000 metric
tons from the Chinese under the Agriculture Department program that
lets them buy grain at cut-rate prices.
   The wheat sold to the Soviet Union by private exporters was part
of 2 million tons authorized Dec. 23 under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP, Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager
for the department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said Tuesday.
   The wheat was bought under a long-term supply agreement with the
United States, now in its sixth year.
   Sims said the wheat is for shipment in January, February and
March. Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements,
the Soviets have 670,200 tons still available under the program.
   The Chinese, however, have used almost all of their current
subsidy authorization. In the past, each country has had new
authorizations set by USDA after exhausting what was available.
   The Soviet Union bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under
EEP arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement. The
pact expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec. 31,
1990.
   The EEP arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in
order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Last year, U.S. corn sales to the Soviet Union totaled slightly
less than 5.2 million tons. Wheat sales in 1987-88, all subsidized,
totaled slightly more than 9 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 530,000 tons of
wheat would be about 19.5 million bushels.
   Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging more than $4 per
bushel, according to recent USDA market figures, making the new sale
worth an estimated $78 million.
   Besides the wheat for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the
Soviets have ordered 10.2 million tons of corn, 450,000 tons of
soybeans, and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of
grain sorghum. Only the wheat is subsidized.
   Sims said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy rate of
$23.35 per ton, or about 64 cents per bushel. He said the bonuses on
the 530,000 tons of wheat will be paid to eight companies: Cargill
Inc., 80,000 tons; Continental Grain Co., 200,000; Garnac Grain Co.,
50,000; Richco Grain Ltd., 50,000; Tradigrain Inc., 50,000;
Mitsubishi International Corp., 25,000; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 25,000;
and Bunge Corp., 50,000.
   In the case of the 200,000 tons sold to China, Sims said the
wheat was part of 1 million tons authorized Dec. 30 for China.
   The wheat sales were handled by two companies: Cargill Inc.,
115,000 tons, and Louis Dreyfus Corp., 85,000 tons.
   Sims said the wheat was sold for March shipment and will carry an
average subsidy rate of $22.49 per ton, or about 62 cents per bushel.
   Only 10,000 tons remain available to China under the program, he
said.

   The Agriculture Department says that for the
first time it will reserve some of its summer jobs for students from
17 historically black universities.
   Deputy Secretary Peter C. Myers said Tuesday that 563 of the 1989
summer jobs will be held aside as part of the department's effort
``to increase the number of minority students in agriculture,
forestry and home economics.''
   Last year 17,753 students nationwide worked during the summer
months for various USDA agencies, and officials said they expect
about that many this year. The 563 jobs reserved for the black
schools would represent about 3 percent of the total.
   ``Agriculture is more than crop and livestock production,'' Myers
said. ``Animal and plant sciences, economics, forestry, marketing
and computer technology are just some of the varied career fields in
agriculture today.''
   Myers said the jobs will be with 19 USDA agencies and will be
located nationwide. He said interested students at 17 institutions
should contact university placement offices before March 1.
   The universities, collectively known as 1890 institutions because
of land-grant legislation that year, are being targeted in other
ways by USDA, Myers said.
   On Dec. 29, the department announced it is establishing offices
at each of the 17 schools to help encourage more minorities in
agriculture. Also, on Jan. 9, the proposed USDA budget for next year
included $80.2 million for new and expanded programs to increase the
teaching, recruitment and research capabilities at the 1890 schools,
a 20 percent increase from the current level.
   The 17 schools are:
   Alabama A&amp;M, Huntsville.
   Alcorn State University, Lorman, Miss.
   University of Arkansas, Pine Bluff.
   Delaware State College, Dover.
   Florida A&amp;M University, Tallahassee.
   Fort Valley State College, Fort Valley, Ga.
   Kentucky State University, Frankfort.
   Langston University, Langston, Okla.
   Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Mo.
   University of Maryland-Eastern Shore, Princess Anne.
   North Carolina A&amp;T State University, Greensboro.
   Prairie View A&amp;M University, Prairie View, Texas.
   South Carolina State College, Orangeburg.
   Southern University, Baton Rouge, La.
   Tennessee State University, Nashville.
   Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Ala.

<HEAD>Moiseyev Dance Company Opens at Radio City</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs Planned</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moiseyev Dance Company, visiting America for
the eighth time since 1958, proves it can still surprise.
   Dancing briskly with their knees bent in an impossible squat,
vaulting high in the air, these Soviet dancers are astonishingly
athletic and virtuosic, and they look like they're really having
fun. The audience picks up on that and has fun, too.
   The company opened at Radio City Music Hall for 14 performances
on Tuesday. They look splendid on that tall, wide stage.
   There are old favorites on the bill, but Igor Moiseyev, 83, who
founded the company in 1937, has choreographed some new things as
well. This is good for viewers who've seen the company before.
   ``Partisans,'' in which dancers in long cloaks glide as though on
rollers, then break into horse-like gaits, will always look
remarkable, no matter how often seen.
   A new one on this tour is ``Aragonnaise Jota,'' based on Spanish
dance. It's brief and beautiful, the men in white and black, the
women in white blouses, red skirts and black lace aprons. Another
new one to America is ``Malamba,'' which Moiseyev built using
Argentine dances.
   Also on Tuesday's program was ``Polovtsian Dances,'' from 1974,
set to Borodin music known here primarily from ``Kismet.'' The Khan
reviews his warriors and captive women. The women are in harem dress
and Moiseyev has managed to make their dancing exotic and not at all
sexy. It's a long dance with a string of solos and small dances for
various ensembles. It would be too lavish for a classical ballet but
in this gravity-defying style it seemed an admirable production
number.
   Farcical timing is all in ``Sanchakou,'' in which two Chinese men
have a swordfight in the dark. At the beginning, when one puts out
his candle, the spotlight gets smaller. It gives the illusion
they're in the dark but lets the audience see every near slice.
   The tour began last week in Stamford, Conn., and went to Boston
before coming to New York. From Jan. 31 through March 20, the
Moiseyev will perform in Washington, D.C., Chicago, Clearwater,
Fla., Miami Beach, Los Angeles, Cupertino, Calif., and San Francisco.

<HEAD>NBC Continues Winning Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC is creeping up on the all-time streak of
weekly victories in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings after racking up
its 30th in a row.
   And on Sunday, NBC should have the highest-rated show of the
season, the Super Bowl, and seemingly clear sailing after that. It
already has won all 17 weeks of the official television season. Of
course, CBS and ABC figure the season has an asterisk since they got
started late because of the writers strike.
   The last time a network won an entire season was CBS in 1963-64.
NBC came within a week of that 39-week record last season, but the
World Series on ABC broke it.
   Thanks to a football playoff, CBS flirted with first place two
weeks ago, but NBC managed to eke it out. Things were back to
relative normal last week.
   NBC won the week with an average prime-time rating of 16.1. ABC
was second with 13.0 and CBS had 12.6. That was close to the
season-to-date average _ NBC has a 15.8, ABC 13.0 and CBS 12.2.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 homes with televisions.
   The ``CBS Evening News'' won the news race with a 12.1. ``ABC
World News Tonight'' had 11.4; ``NBC Nightly News'' 10.9.
   Several prime-time NBC shows last week recorded their highest
ratings this season: ``Cheers,'' ``A Different World,'' ``Midnight
Caller'' and ``In the Heat of the Night.''
   The week's top-rated show was NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' whose
29.8 rating was its highest of the season, except for an earlier
special one-hour episode.
   The rest of the top 10 were: ``A Different World,'' NBC;
``Cheers,'' NBC; ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC; ``The
Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; ``60 Minutes,''
CBS; ``L.A. Law,'' NBC; and ``Dear John,'' NBC.
   The lowest-rated shows were: ``Mission Impossible,'' ``Incredible
Sunday,'' ``Tattinger's,'' ``A Fine Mess,'' ``West 57th,''
``HeartBeat,'' ``Knightwatch,'' ``TV 101'' and ``Murphy's Law.''

   A wheat supply crunch in the United States and
Canada is helping the 12-nation European Economic Community export
surplus grain at record levels and fat prices, according to
Agriculture Department analysts.
   The department's Foreign Agricultural Service said Tuesday that
``limited southern hemisphere exportable supplies'' of wheat,
coupled with a tight inventory in North America, is behind the surge
in EEC exports.
   According to the agency's report, the EEC will export a record 19
million metric tons of wheat in the international trading year that
runs through June, up from 15.3 million tons in 1987-88.
   Meanwhile, U.S. wheat exports were projected at 40.9 million
tons, down from 43.4 million tons in 1987-88. Canada's exports were
shown at 11.7 million tons, down from 23.6 million last year.
Australia and Argentina also showed declines.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   It said the 1989 U.S. winter wheat crop, for harvest this coming
summer, ``will be the first new-crop supplies available for export
and, given the nature of the world wheat market, the size and
quality of this crop will likely set the stage for prices in
1989-90.''
   The USDA reported last week that American farmers had boosted
plantings of winter wheat for this year's harvest by 12 percent.
However, much of the newly planted crop is in need of moisture.
   ``Wheat prices continue to strengthen and have reached their
highest level since January 1982 amid a flurry of recent purchases
and early concerns about the North America wheat crop,'' the report
said.
   The global wheat stockpile by this summer is expected to shrink
to 115.3 million tons from 145.6 million tons a year ago, the report
said. Foreign supplies were projected at 100.8 million tons,
compared with 14.5 million tons in the United States.
   Last summer the U.S. share of the wheat inventory was 34.3
million tons and the remainder of the world, 111.3 million tons.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Democrats Hope Van Buren Precedent Stands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Once again Democrats are out in the cold on
Inauguration Day, spectators as a Republican takes office as
president. But like George Bush, the Democrats are developing a
special fondness for Martin Van Buren.
   In his first news conference as president-elect, Bush expressed
his gratitude to President Reagan and then said, ``I also want to
thank Martin Van Buren for paving the way. It's been a long time,
Marty.''
   Not since Van Buren's election in 1836 had an incumbent vice
president succeeded in winning the White House.
   But the Democrats like the second half of the Van Buren story: he
was a one-term president, defeated when he ran for re-election in
1840.
   As usual, there is a bumper crop of politicians hoping to be the
star at a Democratic celebration next Inauguration Day.
   Start with familiar names from the 1988 campaign _ Michael
Dukakis, Jesse Jackson, Lloyd Bentsen, Albert Gore Jr., Richard
Gephardt. All are regarded as likely contenders when the 1992
campaign gets rolling.
   Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Sam Nunn of Georgia refused
to run in 1988, but may not be so reticent the next time around. The
same goes for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York is a name sure to come up in
connection with 1992. And would the early stages of presidential
speculation be complete without mention of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy?
   What about a woman? Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado was tempted to
join the 1988 field, but decided against it. She has a book coming
out in February and plans to do a lot of traveling to promote it.
   Long shots? The Senate is filled with them. Sen. George Mitchell
of Maine was no sooner elected majority leader than whispers began
suggesting he'd be an impressive presidential candidate. Newly
elected Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska also was being mentioned even
before moving to Washington. The same was true of Sen. Charles Robb
of Virginia.
   And somewhere out there in America is a senator, congressman,
governor or businessman whose name will come up a year or two from
now, touted as the candidate who could break the Republican hold on
the White House.
   Trips to Iowa, site of the first Democratic presidential
caucuses, are a good sign of whether a politician has White House
fever.
   Former professional basketball star Bradley made a guest
appearance early this year at a college basketball tournament in
Iowa.
   It's a good bet that Democratic legislative candidates in Iowa
will have all the big-name help they want in the 1990 campaign.
   Several of the most prominent prospects for 1992 have re-election
campaigns in 1990. They include Bradley, Gore, Nunn, Cuomo, Clinton,
Gephardt and Schroeder.
   Dukakis, the defeated 1988 presidential nominee, recently
announced he would not seek another term as governor of
Massachusetts in 1990, a decision he said ``has nothing to do with
national office.''
   But, Dukakis also said one of the lessons he had learned in 1988
was that ``it is very difficult to run for the presidency as an
incumbent governor.''
   Texas Sen. Bentsen impressed many voters with his performance as
the Democratic vice presidential nominee and that seems likely to
merit him mention for 1992. But Bentsen will turn 71 on Feb. 11,
1992.

   William Henry Harrison, the ninth president of
the United States, pledged in his inaugural address not to run for a
second term. He died a month later from pneumonia probably
contracted while delivering that address on a bitterly cold day.
   Harrison's speech was notable not only for its no-repeat promise,
but also because it was the longest on record. It is not remembered
for its rhetoric, which included this sentence: ``The spirit of
liberty is the sovereign balm for every injury which our
institutions may receive.''
   Most presidents, however, have reserved their finest
phrase-making for their inauguration speech. Abraham Lincoln
exhorted his countrymen, when he was sworn for the second term, to
act ``with malice toward none; with charity for all.'' Franklin D.
Roosevelt told Depression-plagued Americans that ``the only thing we
have to fear is fear itself.'' Harry Truman proclaimed: ``I say to
all men, what we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass in
greater liberty.''
   Thomas Jefferson, the most gifted writer of all 40 presidents,
enunciated a basic tenet of democracy: ``absolute acquiescence in
the will of the majority.''
   The tradition of invoking a higher power dates back to George
Washington, who added ``so help me God'' to his oath and kissed the
Bible. In the day of the father of our country the inaugural
ceremony was indoors. It was moved outside in 1817 by James Monroe.
   The best remembered inaugural speech, for its eloquence, is John
F. Kennedy's in 1961.
   ``Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and
foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of
Americans _ born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a
hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage,'' he said.
   ``Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that
we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support
any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of
liberty.''
   And, ``ask not what America will do for you _ ask what you can do
for your country.''
   His successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, said in his 1965 inaugural
address that America's heritage must be relearned in each
generation. ``If we fail now, then we will have forgotten in
abundance what we learned in hardship; that democracy rests on
faith, that freedom asks more than it gives, and the judgment of God
is harshest on those who are most favored.''
   Richard Nixon said in 1969 that ``what has to be done, has to be
done by government and people together or it will not be done at
all. The lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do
nothing _ with the people we can do everything.''
   Gerald Ford, never elected, had no opportunity to deliver an
inaugural address. But he was at his most eloquent at his
swearing-in after Nixon resigned: ``Our long national nightmare is
over. Our Constitution works; our great republic is a government of
laws and not men. Here the people rule.''
   In his turn, in 1977, Jimmy Carter began his tenure with praise
for Ford. ``For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my
predecessor for all he has done to heal our land,'' Carter said. He
told his fellow citizens that ``the bold and brilliant dream which
excited the founders of this nation still awaits its consummation. I
have no new dream to set forth today, but rather urge a fresh faith
in the old dream.''
   Ronald Reagan launched his eight years in the White House with a
refrain from his campaign: ``Government is not the solution to our
problem; government is the problem.'' And, ``It is not my intention
to do away with government. It is rather to make it work _ work with
us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back.''

<HEAD>Fiero Fire Allegations Subject of New NHTSA Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration says it will investigate reports of fires in the
engine compartments of 1985 and 1986 Pontiac Fiero cars.
   The preliminary evaluation, the lowest level of investigation by
the safety agency, follows the recall in 1987 of 125,000 Fieros from
the 1984 model year after similar fire reports.
   The latest investigation involves about 147,000 Fieros and was
ordered after the agency received 16 unconfirmed complaints of
fires. One of the complaints said the fire resulted in an injury,
NHTSA said Tuesday.
   General Motors Corp., which makes the Fiero, said it was
reviewing the allegations in preparing its response to NHTSA. GM
spokesman John Anderson said, as is usual in such cases, that the
opening of an inquiry doesn't necessarily mean there is a defect.
   NHTSA also opened six other low-level investigations into safety
allegations involving cars, vans and light trucks made by major U.S.
manufacturers.
   The preliminary evaluations focused on unconfirmed reports of:
   _Steering-linkage lockup causing a loss of control in 35,000 1988
GM Chevrolet Blazer and Jimmy K5 vehicles. NHTSA reported five
complaints with one accident reported.
   _Electronic air-suspension failure involving 60,000 1988-1989
Ford Motor Co. Lincoln Continental cars. The agency had received
three complaints, including one involving an accident with injury.
   _Fires under the bodies of 1986-1988 Ford F150 and F350 pickup
trucks having the F1 fuel-injected engine. The agency had received
three complaints.
   _Cutting and fraying of the right-hand front seatbelt in 450,000
1986-1988 Ford Aerostars. Two complaints were received.
   _Antifreeze fires under the hoods of 1,000 1983-1987 Ford F350
trucks converted to ambulances. NHTSA received five complaints.
   _Electrical shorts in the tail-light wiring harness of 416,000
1987 Chrysler Dodge Omni cars. Three complaints were reported by
NHTSA.
   NHTSA raised to an engineering analysis, a higher level of
investigation, its study of unconfirmed reports of brake-light
failure in 1985 BMW cars.
   The agency also ended three preliminary evaluations into major
manufacturers' vehicles and concluded in each case there was ``no
defect trend.''
   The investigations closed were into unsubstantiated reports of:
   _Heater-core rupture in 1987 VW Golf vehicles.
   _Floor-mat interference with the gas pedal on 1987-1988 Ford
Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar cars.
   _Rear-hub failure in 1986-1987 GM Pontiac Fieros.

<HEAD>Court Lets Gerrymandering Stand in California, Rejects Bundy Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court ruling over a California
redistricting plan shows the court may be unwilling to restrain
state legislatures from high-tech gerrymandering that gives one
political party a big edge when drawing congressional district lines.
   The high court's ruling comes at a time when state legislatures
are anticipating redrawing congressional district lines once the
1990 census is completed.
   The justices, by a vote of 6-3, ruled Tuesday the constitutional
rights of Republicans were not violated by a California
redistricting plan that gave Democrats solid control of the state's
congressional delegation.
   The court upheld the plan in a one-sentence ruling, sustaining a
lower court decision that Republicans did not suffer unlawful
discrimination.
   Republicans said the Democratic-controlled Legislature, using new
computer technology, unlawfully manipulated district boundaries.
   The ruling drew quick reaction from national political leaders,
including outgoing Republican National Committee Chairman Frank
Fahrenkopf and his successor, Lee Atwater.
   ``Our immediate goal will be to increase Republican
representation and control in 1990 in statehouses so that the
redistricting process following the next census will be in the hands
of responsible elected officials, conscious of their constitutional
responsibilities,'' a joint statement said.
   Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr., D-Ark., chairman of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, welcomed the ruling.
   ``The decision vindicates our judgment that the California
redistricting plan was lawful and fair to the voters of
California,'' he said. ``The Republican Party was trying to win in
court what it could not win with the voters.''
   In other matters Tuesday, the court:
   _Rejected multiple murderer Theodore Bundy's challenge to his
death sentence for killing a 12-year-old girl in Florida. The man
linked to as many as 36 sex slayings or disappearances of young
women faces execution Tuesday.
   _Turned down the appeals of four California death row inmates,
including a man linked to the sex slayings of four boys in
California, Texas, West Virginia and New Jersey.
   _Let stand a ruling in a case from Boston that allows
anti-smoking groups to see and publicize a cigarette company's
research the groups say could link smoking to health hazards.
   _Rejected a challenge to a Virginia law exempting religiously
affiliated child-care centers from some health and safety
regulations all other child-care centers must meet.
   _Agreed to decide whether people who intervene in civil rights
cases _ and are not the principal defendants _ may be forced to pay
the lawyer fees incurred by those who successfully sue. The case
stems from a sex bias lawsuit against Trans World Airlines.
   _Heard arguments in a free-speech challenge to a Massachusetts
law that cracks down on child pornography. The justices are to
announce a decision by July.
   In the California redistricting case, Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy
voted to grant full review to the dispute. Four votes are needed to
grant such review.
   The other six justices joined in upholding the lower court ruling
sustaining the redistricting plan. Their one-sentence decision said
simply that ``the judgment is affirmed.''
   The court said in 1986 in an Indiana legislative reapportionment
case that gerrymandering _ the manipulation of voting district
boundaries for partisan gain _ may be unlawful even when it results
in districts meeting the ``one-person, one-vote'' requirement that
districts be equally populated.
   The justices have held that only if there is evidence of racial
bias may a district plan be overturned even when the balanced
population test is met.
   But in splintered voting, the justices upheld the Indiana plan
that was attacked as a violation of Democrats' rights.
   The 1986 decision left key questions unanswered, and only four
justices joined in the court's main opinion, written by Justice
Byron R. White.
   White said gerrymandering might be unconstitutional if it ``will
consistently degrade a voter's or a group of voters' influence on
the political processes as a whole.''
   California Republicans said that is exactly what has happened to
them.
   ``The essence of representative democracy is undermined'' when
``a computer-generated gerrymander can preordain what the
congressional results will be throughout the decade,'' they said in
seeking Supreme Court reconsideration.
   A three-judge federal court, by a 2-1 vote last April, upheld
California's plan.
   The federal court said Republicans failed to show that the plan
deprived them of political power and fair representation.
   ``There are no allegations that California Republicans have been
shut out of the political process, nor are there allegations that
anyone has ever interfered with Republican registration, organizing,
voting, fund-raising or campaigning,'' said Judge Cecil F. Poole for
the federal court.
   Poole, noting that California has a Republican governor, a
Republican U.S. senator and 18 GOP House members, said there is no
evidence the party is ``bereft of the ability to exercise potent
power in the political process as a whole.''
   Republicans said the Democratic-controlled state Legislature
rigged district lines to allow Democrats to win 27 of the 45 House
seats from California even though Republican candidates overall
received roughly half the votes cast in recent elections.

   An environmental group says it is applying one
of Ronald Reagan's favorite slogans to George Bush's claim to care
about fighting pollution: ``Trust but Verify.''
   David Baker, political director of Friends of the Earth, said
Tuesday the slogan applies because Bush spearheaded the Reagan
administration's drive to relax many government regulations early in
its tenure.
   ``We're willing to take him at his word right now when he says
he's an environmentalist, but we're keeping him on a short leash,''
Baker said. ``Trust but Verify'' is slogan Reagan has often quoted
about arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union.
   Baker's was one of several advocacy groups represented at a news
conference held by consumer activist Ralph Nader to promote their
highly critical view of the Reagan years.
   The groups summed up their longstanding differences with the
administration's regulation of food, drugs, the environment,
pesticides, auto safety and energy.
   The Environmental Protection Administration was ``in bed with the
polluters'' in the early years of the Reagan administration, Baker
said.
   Although that stopped with a change in agency leadership, EPA has
removed only 18 sites from the list of 1,175 scheduled for priority
handling under the ``Superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program and has
completed work at only 45 more, said Baker.
   Nader said he called the news conference to offset what Nader
called an ``orchestrated media cloud nine'' that he blamed in part
on ``the abdication of the role of loyal opposition by the
Democratic Party, none of whose leaders have made any attempt to
reflect publicly on the record of the Reagan government.''
   Among the criticisms:
   _The administration's opposition to and delay of air bags in cars
cost 40,000 lives and 1 million injuries, said Joan Claybrook, head
of Public Citizen, the umbrella advocacy organization founded by
Nader. Ms. Claybrook was head of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration in President Carter's administration.
   _Relaxed oversight of drugs and medical devices cost thousands of
lives, said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health
Research Group. Delay of warnings on aspirin about Reye's syndrome
cost 1,000 lives, he said. ``The worst of my fears have come to
pass,'' Wolfe said.
   _The Environmental Protection Agency plans to relax pesticide
residue standards on foods and has adopted a farmworker protection
policy ``that protects employers,'' said Jay Feldman, coordinator of
the National Campaign Against the Misuse of Pesticides.
   _The administration failed to pursue conservation, overemphasized
nuclear power and rolled back auto efficiency standards, complained
Ken Bossong, director of Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy
Project and Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for
Auto Safety, a group founded with Nader's help.
   _Under orders from the White House, FDA ``fought hard to keep
cancer-causing food additives on the market, has substituted
politics and rigid ideology for reasoned scientific
decision-making'' and has starved its food regulatory program so
much that even the industry pleaded for bigger budgets, said Bruce
Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest.

   Some of the biggest names in show business are
rehearsing for a glittering, nationally televised inaugural gala
Thursday night that will boast George Bush and Dan Quayle as special
guests in the black-tie audience of 12,000 people.
   Inaugural officials say the two-hour show may attract a
prime-time TV audience of 40 million to 60 million viewers. Ticket
sales and proceeds from TV commercials may gross about $9 million,
making the gala the biggest moneymaker in four days of privately
financed inaugural festivities.
   Rehearsals began at midday Tuesday in the cavernous Washington
Convention Center when a Walter Cronkite stand-in introduced
Broadway and TV star Nell Carter, who danced and belted out the
opening number, Fats Waller's ``The Joint is Jumpin,'' with a
frenetic chorus line wearing sweatsuits.
   Miss Carter said she voted for Bush in the November election. ``I
think he's an honorable man,'' she said. ``I think he should be
given a chance.''
   Other gala headliners will include singers Frank Sinatra, Anita
Baker and Julio Iglesias; ballet dancers Susan Jaffe and Mikhail
Baryshnikov, actor and muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger, child
fiddlers from Kentucky and Idaho, Broadway hoofer Tommy Tune,
cellist Yo Yo Ma, actor Chuck Norris, opera singer Roberta Peters,
Gen. Chuck Yeager, the U.S. Naval Academy Glee Club and the Mormon
Tabernacle Choir.
   The 13 acts will include two of Bush's country and Western
favorites, Loretta Lynn and the Oak Ridge Boys, along with Randy
Travis, Crystal Gayle, Cissy Lynn and Peggy Sue Wright.
   Producer Don Mischer of Los Angeles said the cast of more than
1,100 performers will represent a ``cross-section of American
entertainment'' and will include ``some surprises'' which he refused
to disclose. However, a stack of oversized cue cards for comedian
Bob Hope was spotted behind a TV camera in the rear of the hall.
   All 90 of the eight-seat ``boxes'' at the gala _ actually stack
chairs surrounded by flimsy blue partitions on the floor facing the
stage _ were sold for $25,000 each, for a total of $2.25 million.
Other seats were ticketed at $150 to $250, depending on location.
   The president-elect, his family and guests will sit in a large,
elevated box facing the front of the stage, which will be surrounded
by seats. A smaller box for Vice President-elect Quayle and his
guests will be situated to Bush's left.
   Inaugural officials say 14 minutes of TV commercial time already
have been sold for $4.9 million. Proceeds from invitation-only
ticket sales could boost gross revenues to about $9 million.
   With big-name performers donating their time for free, the gala
could yield about $6 million after expenses to help defray inaugural
costs.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Group Urges Bush to Toughen Enforcement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush should set tough civil
rights enforcement as a major goal of his administration, a
17-member panel of former federal officials says.
   ``There is a major rebuilding job to be done to reconstruct the
machinery of enforcing civil rights,'' Washington attorney William
L. Taylor said at a news conference called by the Citizens
Commission on Civil Rights.
   The private group released a 37-page report titled ``One Nation,
Indivisible: The Civil Rights Challenge for the 1990s,'' which
offered evidence of a falloff in civil rights enforcement in the
Reagan era.
   It said the Justice Department has filed 31 cases to challenge
discriminatory voting practices since 1981. Panel members called
that a sharp drop from the record of earlier administrations.
   The report also said enforcement of equal employment rules
applying to federal contractors declined from 269 cases in 1980 to
22 cases in 1986.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development estimates that 2
million cases of housing bias occur each year, but an average of 10
housing discrimination cases have been filed annually, the report
said.
   Taylor said that number represented about half the level under
the administrations of former presidents Carter and Nixon.
   Justice Department spokesman Mark Weaver criticized the notion
that there has been a slowdown.
   He cited a victory in a key housing bias case in Yonkers, N.Y.,
as well as a major voting rights case pending against Los Angeles
County and a lawsuit filed two months ago to bar alleged hiring
discrimination by New Jersey's police hiring system.
   ``We've taken heat for these things but we've continued to
enforce the laws strenuously,'' he said.
   He said he could not readily verify that the eight-year total of
voting rights cases was 31. But he did say that because court
actions under previous administrations remain in place ``the number
by definition gets smaller.''
   As for cases involving federal contractors, he said, the Justice
Department has no authority to initiate suits and merely acts on
matters referred to it by the Labor Department.
   Arthur Flemming, chairman of the commission, said the group was
sending its report to Bush ``in the hope that he can turn around the
'80s as far as civil rights enforcement is concerned.''

<HEAD>Soft-Pedaling Increases Won't Fool Public, Bush Adviser Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public is likely to view higher levies on
gasoline, alcohol and tobacco as tax increases, even if politicians
try to soft-pedal them by calling them ``user fees,''
President-elect Bush's incoming budget director says.
   The comments by Richard Darman shed light on the thinking of the
new administration and Bush, who campaigned on a pledge of no new
taxes. Lawmakers and others in Washington have been closely watching
the words of Bush and his aides to see if the vice president backs
off his campaign promise.
   Darman submitted written answers to questions posed by the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, which holds confirmation hearings
Thursday on his appointment. The questionnaire and responses were
obtained Tuesday from a source who asked to not be identified.
   Darman, who has been tapped as Bush's chief of the Office of
Management and Budget, said that ``depending on the application of
funds,'' taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcohol might be called user
fees.
   But he added, ``the public, however, tends to see these rather
unequivocally as taxes.''
   He said fees for government services are not a tax ``as long as
the government is directly charging the beneficiary only for the
cost of the service provided by the government.''
   He also said eliminating the deduction for interest on certain
types of borrowing and taxing employer-provided fringe benefits
could be considered ``definitional changes.''
   ``One could engage in long discussions of when one or another
revenue measure is or is not a tax,'' Darman wrote.
   ``Putting academics and sophistry aside, however, my suspicion is
that in the end such definitional matters are political: applying
the old if-it-looks-like-a-duck rule, if it looks like a tax to most
Americans, it's a tax.''
   Many congressional Democrats have said they do not understand how
the fiscal 1990 deficit can be reduced to $100 billion, as required
by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law, without new taxes.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., asked
Tuesday about Darman's comments on taxes, said President Reagan was
never tagged as a taxer, even though he signed 11 tax increases into
law.
   ``George Bush may find he wants to try to follow in that
tradition, but one thing should be clear: We in Congress stand ready
to work with the administration to deal with these massive deficits,
regardless of semantics, and we look forward to a budget proposal
from George Bush,'' he said in a written statement.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., also
discussed budget matters Tuesday, indicating that the $13 billion in
new revenues contained in the spending plan Reagan submitted last
week might be a good starting point for negotiations between the
White House and Congress.
   ``If the Reagan number is used, which is $13 billion, then
obviously that gives us the opportunity to look not only at those
that were suggested by the administration, but other areas as well
in order to meet that number,'' Panetta told members of the National
Press Club.
   Panetta said the revenue raisers proposed by Reagan, along with
excise taxes on items such as energy, ``are worthy of
consideration.''
   In his budget, Reagan proposed raising new money by selling
federal assets, imposing or increasing user fees, repealing a
reduction in aviation taxes, and other measures.

<HEAD>Loophole Open for $39 Million in House Campaign Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A select group of 190 House members stockpiled
$39.2 million in campaign money that can be converted to their
personal use under a loophole in election laws, a non-profit group
says.
   Public Citizen's Congress Watch noted Tuesday that the select
group is covered by a special provision in federal law permitting
those who were serving in the House on Jan. 8, 1980, to keep any
remaining campaign funds.
   The report also said the members of the House elected to the new
Congress have built combined campaign war chests of $67 million.
   Public Citizen is a research, lobbying and litigation group
founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader in 1971.
   Its report blamed the surplus campaign chests for the 98 percent
success rate among House incumbents running in 1988 and 1986,
adding, ``There is a greater turnover in the Supreme Soviet than in
the U.S. House of Representatives.''
   ``This certainly discourages qualified candidates from
challenging the financially stronger representatives and further
ensures the `incumbent lock' on the House.''
   The report covered the period from Jan. 1, 1987, through Nov. 28,
1988.
   The $67 million in surplus money averages $154,000 per member, up
39 percent from the 1985-86 balance of $48.4 million _ an average of
$111,332.
   The $39.2 million stockpiled by 189 current members and the late
Rep. Bill Nichols, D-Ala., for possible personal use is a 34 percent
increase from the amount on hand in January 1987.
   Those who can take advantage of the loophole can watch their
money grow ``until they retire,'' the report said. The money ``can
be transferred to other political races, donated to their favorite
charities (while writing off the tax deduction), used to buy a new
car or pay for that needed vacation,'' according to the report.
   The report said Reps. David Dreier, R-Calif., Stephen J. Solarz,
D-N.Y., and Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., each have more than $1 million
stockpiled, with Solarz and Rostenkowski permitted to convert the
money to personal use.
   After surveying how former House members used the money, the
report said that Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., spent $386,064 in
leftover campaign funds on legal expenses related to his criminal
convictions.
   He was found guilty of accepting an illegal gratuity and
obstruction of justice in accepting a paid Florida vacation from a
former Brooklyn Democratic leader; and of racketeering and accepting
bribes from Wedtech Corp. in exchange for his Washington influence.
   The late Rep. James Howard, D-N.J., left $310,000 to his wife,
and the late Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., left more than $600,000 to
his family, the report said.

   Suicides and other unnatural deaths have increased
by 50 percent during the 1980s, the official Xinhua News Agency said
today.
   A survey of 10 million people in 25 locales found that the death
rate from unnatural causes increased from 31 per 100,000 people in
1981 to 47 in 1987.
   Four-fifths of the deaths came by suicide, drowning, poisoning
and traffic accidents, Xinhua said. The report did not say if murder
was included in the statistics.
   China gives no statistics on suicide, but Xinhua said that in the
countryside, where most Chinese live, one-third of unnatural deaths
were by suicide. More women than men took their own lives, it said.
   The survey found that family disputes, marital problems and poor
personal relations led to half the suicides. About 20 percent of
suicides were terminally ill patients.
   The report said two-thirds of those killing themselves used
poison, and called for tighter control over dispensing of poisons.
   Tens of thousands of Chinese are believed to have killed
themselves during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when
ultra-leftists persecuted huge numbers of people.
   Today, most suicides are linked to personal problems and
difficulties in adjusting to social changes as China switches to a
more market-oriented, competitive economic system. Last year, the
nation's first non-governmental suicide prevention center was
established in Canton.

   Ah, soon the pitter-patter of little feet
_ lots of them _ might be heard at the White House.
   Millie, President-elect and Barbara Bush's springer spaniel, has
spent the last two weeks at a farm in Kentucky, where she was mated
with Tug, a springer spaniel owned by Will and Sarah Farish.
   ``We believe she's pregnant, but we don't know that for a fact,''
Farish said Monday.
   Farish said they would know in about three weeks if the
2-year-old dog is pregnant. If she is, she likely would give birth
in March.
   The Farishes gave Millie to the Bushes about a year ago.
   Farish said he telephoned Mrs. Bush on Friday and ``told her
everything had gone fine.''
   ``She's very close to Millie,'' he said.

   A retired obstetrician used his trade
skills and techniques he saw on a television show about a
veterinarian to ``deliver'' a 55-pound dog from the 6-foot deep hole
it had been digging for months.
   Dr. Daniel B. Dorman's next-door neighbor called him Saturday
night when she found Dusty, a 10-year-old mutt, was stuck in the
hole, with just his wagging tail sticking out.
   Dorman got a shovel and pickax, but found they were of limited
use on the frozen ground.
   Drawing on his experience delivering breech babies and memories
of the TV show ``All Creatures Great and Small,'' Dorman worked his
arm into the hole, grabbed the dog's hind legs, stretched them out
and tied them with a rope.
   He then pulled the rope slowly to free the mutt, which was dirty
but unharmed.
   ``This was the first delivery I've had since I stopped practicing
seven years ago,'' Dorman said. ``I hope it's my last breech
delivery.''

   Should he be hoisted by his own petard, George
Herbert Walker Bush will begin his presidency with one of the sorest
arms in history.
   About 35,000 little American flags will be distributed to
spectators at his inaugural Friday. At least 700 larger flags will
be carried before him in the hours-long parade to follow.
   Can the man who espoused the pledge of allegiance to the flag
with religious fervor in the last campaign get by with just an
occasional salute? With all those flags, just a token movement of
the arm toward the heart could leave Bush with the sorest arm since
Sandy Koufax quit baseball.
   The marching band from the University of Texas alone could wear
out the new president. Its 320 marchers will carry 30 flags along
with 60 trumpets, 40 trombones, 20 baritones, 24 tubas, 26
percussion, 36 clarinet, 30 french horns, 25 saxophones and 24
piccolos. Can a man from Texas stand motionless before all that?
   The statistics come courtesy of the inaugural committee, which
produced a handbook of breathtaking scope. It tells far more than
you could possibly want to know about inaugurals in compelling
detail. For example:
   Bush and the six presidents before him were all born between 1908
and 1924, a fact the need of which is not yet clear.
   Bush will rank with the four tallest presidents in history,
behind Abe Lincoln, Lyndon Johnson and Thomas Jefferson. He also
will enter history books as one of four left-handed presidents, the
others being James Garfield, Harry Truman and Gerald Ford.
   The dome of the Capitol expands and contracts as much as four
inches because of the heat of the sun by day and cooling by night,
which is in sharp contrast to most of its tenants who are known to
expand frequently and contract seldom.
   Mrs. William Howard Taft was the first woman to ride in an
inaugural parade in 1913. Warren Harding was the first president to
ride to his swearing-in in a car. Richard Nixon was the first to
review his parade behind bullet-proof glass.
   Bush is 31st among college graduates who made it to the White
House, 12th among Phi Beta Kappa boys, second among Yale men.
   Married 44 years, George and Barbara Bush bring the ninth longest
marriage to the White House. John and Abigail Adams were married the
longest, 54 years and three days. But Bush is the only president
born in June.
   You will also sleep better knowing that Andrew Johnson was the
only vice president visibly drunk at his inaugural, a condition he
blamed on alcohol consumed to combat the pain of typhoid fever.
   Should you need more for your next game of Trivial Pursuit,
remember Jefferson had the first running water in the White House,
from a cistern he put in the roof; Millard Fillmore had the first
bathtub installed; Rutherford Hayes, the first telephone; William
McKinley, the first elevator; Franklin Roosevelt, the first
dishwasher.
   But George Herbert Walker Bush will be the first captain of a
Yale baseball team to become president. Indisputably.

<HEAD>Quayle Says He Wants To Make GOP More Inclusive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle says that as vice president he hopes
to help open up the Republican Party to the poor and minorities and
turn around its image as ``the party of exclusion.''
   The vice president-elect said that after he is sworn in to office
on Friday he hopes to spend time quietly visiting the disadvantaged
and learning about their problems.
   ``I'd like to go out and not have a lot of advance publicity on
that, just sit down and talk to these people on their turf, in their
neighborhood, on their grounds and to hear them out and get a feel
and get a sensitivity for issues that are of concern to them,''
Quayle said in an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press.
   The former senator from Indiana also endorsed the 50 percent
congressional pay raise that President Reagan backs. Bush has said
he supports Reagan's stance, but that he might take another look at
the matter after he becomes president.
   ``I know it's a lot,'' Quayle said of the raise for federal
judges and Congress members. But he said Reagan ``thought long and
hard. I support his decision.''
   The pay raise plan will take effect next month unless Congress
vetoes or modifies it.
   On another subject, Quayle said Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev ``is in a much stronger position'' than many U.S. skeptics
think. ``He's consolidated power much quicker than any other Soviet
general secretary,'' said Quayle, a former member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
   Quayle said he thinks Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness, ``is for real,'' but he sees the perestroika policy of
economic reform as just a way to consolidate power.
   Quayle has met with several reporters in the past few days after
refusing interviews for much of the period since the Nov. 8 election.
   Discussing how he will handle his new job, Quayle said he will
not speak out at Cabinet meetings, but will relay his opinions to
President Bush privately. The key to his job, he said, is a close
personal relationship with the new president.
   The 41-year-old vice president-elect said he intends to be a
``broad-ranging adviser'' to Bush, who is 64. He said he has been
involved in ``all of the discussions for cabinet'' choices and other
matters, except the early selection of James Baker as secretary of
state.
   Quayle said the assignments Bush gives him will evolve with time
and circumstances. They ``will be of substance, stature and of
importance to the president.''
   ``When you are a broad-ranging adviser to the president, you take
on assignments from him that he deems are important, and from time
to time he will turn to me and say, `I need help here.''' Quayle
said.
   He said he meets daily with Bush and they have discussed a desire
to ``reposition the Republican party, and get out of this
stereotype, stereocast image of being the party of exclusion rather
than the party of inclusion.''
   ``It's this image that somehow you don't care, and it's just not
true of me and it's not true of George Bush,'' he said. ``And
unfortunately the Republican Party is still cast in that mold, and
we're going to try and turn it around.''
   He promised the new administration would ``go to some of the
places Republicans haven't gone before.''
   Quayle has decided he won't spend as much time as he originally
envisioned working as an administration advocate on Capitol Hill,
where the Constitution gives him the job of Senate president. That
is both because he won't have enough time, he said, and because many
of his former colleagues ``want to have the communication up there
(on Capitol Hill), but they also want to have the communication down
here,'' at his White House office.
   Since the election, Quayle said, he doesn't sleep soundly the way
he once did from 11 p.m. to 5:30 or 6 a.m.
   ``I have to confess that periodically you wake up during the
night and you think about the responsibilities and the challenges
that are ahead of you,'' he said. ``And they are responsibilities
that I certainly look forward to, but they are certainly much
different than just being a senator.''

   Artists such as Frank Stella and Roy
Lichtenstein mingled with congressmen, bureaucrats, judges, patrons,
diplomats and other dignitaries at a pre-inaugural party marking the
10th anniversary of the National Gallery of Art's East Building.
   More than 1,000 people attended the black-tie event Tuesday
night, including I.M. Pei, the architect who designed the East
Building at the foot of Capitol Hill; Supreme Court Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy; art collector Estee Lauder; Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va.;
and Carla Hills, nominated by President-elect Bush to be U.S. trade
representative.
   Touring the gallery's newly mounted exhibition of 20th Century
paintings, drawings and sculpture on three floors of the East
Building, Stella predicted that George Bush will continue government
support for the arts, though without any ``great outpouring'' of
federal assistance.
   ``The emphasis will be on the performing arts,'' said Stella,
waving a cigar under one of the giant canvases. ``He won't be
interested in supporting the avant garde. The government's job is to
take care of the majority.''
   ``They don't need to take care of those who can take care of
themselves,'' said Stella, known for his minimalist paintings on
different shaped canvases. ``We're not charity cases.''
   Stella and Lichtenstein agreed that the healthy economy favors
artists by spurring purchase of their works as financial investments
and additions to private collections.
   ``The arts are doing very well now,'' said Lichtenstein, who
famous for his comic strip technique. ``My guess is that they (the
Bush administration) will do more for the arts.''
   Nevertheless, he said: ``It's not that you just spend money and
everything gets better. It's shameful, too, that we have such a
wealthy government that supports art so little compared with other
Western countries.''
   The gallery's recently installed exibition of more than 230 early
art works from Picasso will remain on view for two years with
support by a grant from American Express.

<HEAD>Name Of Stalin's Lieutenant Stripped From Cities Nationwide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has ordered the name of one of Josef
Stalin's top lieutenants, party ideologue Andrei A. Zhdanov,
stripped from universities, factories and cities nationwide.
   The move Tuesday is the latest in a series of actions taken to
wipe out the names of late Kremlin leaders and officials who have
fallen into disgrace or disfavor under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Last month, Communist authorities ordered the names of two recent
Soviet leaders, Leonid I. Brezhnev and Konstantin U. Chernenko,
removed from their homes and from every town, school and factory
still named for them.
   Since coming to power in March 1985, Gorbachev has been
increasing critical of past Soviet leaders, calling Stalin's harsh
29-year rule a deviation from the ideals of Soviet founder Vladimir
I. Lenin and blaming Brezhnev for economic stagnation and corruption.
   Zhdanov, first secretary of the Leningrad Communist Party
organization in 1934-44, died under mysterious circumstances in 1948.
   He directed violent purges in the country's second-largest city
following the 1934 assassination of Sergei Kirov, the former
Leningrad party chief who opposed Stalin's dictatorial rule.
   The liquidation of real or imagined opponents of Stalin is seen
by Western historians as the dawn of the dictator's 1934-38 Great
Purge, in which some 10 million Soviets were arrested, banished into
internal exile, or killed.
   The evening TV news program ``Vremya'' said a recommendation from
the Commpunst Party's policy-making Central Committee to remove
Zhdanov's name from the map was sent to the Supreme Soviet
Presidium, the nation's top executive body, and to the Council of
Ministers and legislatures in the 15 republics.
   Zhdanov ``was one of the sponsors of massive repressions of the
'30s and '40s against guiltless Soviet people,'' said the
announcement on Vremya. ``He is responsible for criminal actions
committed at that time and for the violation of socialist law.''
   Stripped of Zhdanov's name were universities in Leningrad and in
the Siberian city of Irkutsk, the Soviet Army's engineering academy,
and a locomotive works in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, it said.
   A Ukrainian city on the Sea of Azov, renamed Zhdanov in 1948,
will revert to its former name of Mariupol.
   The recommendation from the Central Committee, considered binding
on Soviet government bodies, says Zhdanov's name should be stricken
from ``cities, neighborhoods, streets, enterprises, collective
farms, military units and institutions of learning.''
   In Moscow, both a neighborhood and a subway station bear
Zhdanov's name.
   Under Stalin, Zhdanov also served for a time as party secretary
for ideological affairs. He introduced strict political control and
extreme nationalism into the arts, and opposed Western cultural
influences that were denounced as ``cosmopolitanism.''
   In 1953, a group of Jewish doctors was accused of murdering
Zhdanov, which touched off widespread fears among Soviet Jews that
the Kremlin might be laying the groundwork for an official campaign
of anti-Semitism by staging a show trial of his purported assassins.
   The announcement read on ``Vremya'' and later carried by the Tass
news agency said Zhdanov's name was being erased from the Soviet
landscape ``in response to the numerous requests of workers.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the latest auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills
Tuesday at an average discount rate of 8.30 percent, down from 8.36
percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 8.35 percent, down from 8.48 percent
last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 8.24
percent on Jan. 3, and six-month bills averaged 8.33 percent on Dec.
27.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.60 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,790.20 and and 8.84 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,577.90.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said that the average
yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, fell to 9.11 percent last
week after averaging 9.17 percent the week before.

<HEAD>Iraq and Syria May Have Germ Weapons, US Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military affairs expert says there is good
reason to believe that Iraq and Syria possess biological weapons,
and Israeli officials confirm that Iraq is close to creating such an
arsenal while Syria is in the research stage.
   ``There is strong evidence to suggest that Iraq has biological
weapons, possibly including toxins,'' W. Seth Carus, a researcher at
the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Tuesday.
   Carus, who has been studying the proliferation of chemical and
biological warfare in the Middle East for the past several years at
the privately funded think tank, said reports from Iran that Iraq
used biological agents against its Kurdish minority are unreliable.
   But he added he had been informed by official sources that Iraq
does have such capability. Iraq produces the weapons at a facility
near the village of Salman Pak, 35 miles southeast of Baghdad, ABC
News reported Tuesday, citing unnamed intelligence sources.
   Iraq also has the capacity to make 1,000 tons of chemical agents
annually, Carus said. There is documented proof Iraq used such
weapons as mustard and nerve gas against Iran and against the Kurds
as recently as 1987. Syria manufactures chemical weapons but has
never used them, Carus said.
   Syria also has a stock of biological arms, but it is not known if
it has acquired sophisticated delivery systems such as rockets,
Carus said. Syria may have received help for its program from
communist North Korea, which is known to have a biological warfare
program, Carus said.
   Israeli officials said, however, that Iraq had completed research
and development on such weapons and was ``on the verge'' of
manufacturing them. Syria is in the initial stages of research, said
the officials, who spoke only on condition they not be named.
   Toxins, such as snake venoms, are poisons which are not
biological agents but can easily be produced by using bacteria
cultures. Biological weapons are living organisms that cause lethal
diseases such as cholera, anthrax and typhoid. They can be
introduced into water systems or simply sprayed into the air.
   Iraq, which signed but did not ratify the 1972 biological weapons
treaty, denies having biological or chemical arms.
   A State Department official declined to say if the United States
is aware of the Iraqi capability.
   Egypt is believed to have worked on acquiring biological weapons
in the 1960s, Carus said. In the early 1970s, the late Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat said ``we have the instruments of biological
warfare in the refrigerators.''
   But Egypt did not use the germs in its 1973 war with Israel or in
any other conflict, Carus said.
   Israel has the ability to produce biological agents, ``although
it may not currently have a biological warfare capability,'' Carus
said. Iran has said it intends to acquire such capability, but
little is known about that plan, he added.

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
Wednesday, while share prices closed at another record high as
investors were concerned about U.S. trade figures to be released
later in the day.
   The dollar closed at 127.90 yen, up 0.20 yen from Tuesday's
127.70-yen finish. The currency moved in a range of 127.63-128.00
yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 70.86-point loser the
previous day, regained 127.03 points, or 0.41 percent, to finish at
31,354.55.
   Stock dealers said trading was slow because of investor concern
over the upcoming U.S. trade report, although market sentiment is
still strong.
   In the currency market, traders said the dollar will remain in a
narrow trading range before the Commerce Department releases its
November merchandise trade report. The department will announce the
figure later Wednesday in Washington.
   Tokyo investors predict the U.S. monthly trade deficit will widen
to between $11 billion and $12 billion, compared with $10.35 billion
in October. In recent years the U.S. trade deficit numbers have
become a powerful influence on the foreign-exchange market, because
of their role in U.S. economic policy as well as their
unpredictability from month to month.

<HEAD>Sport Vehicle Importers, U.S. Makers Debate Customs Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. automakers are urging the government to
uphold a Customs Service decision to impose a high import duty on
sport vehicles and vans.
   The chairmen of the three largest U.S. auto manufacturers,
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., urged
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on Tuesday to affirm a Customs
decision that the popular vehicles are trucks and therefore are
subject to a 25 percent import duty, 10 times the duty levied on
cars.
   A reversal of the ruling would ``cause substantial harm to the
U.S. motor vehicle industry, deprive the U.S. Treasury of several
hundred million dollars in anticipated tariff revenues, and unleash
a long battle in the courts and in Congress...'' said GM's Roger
Smith, Ford's Donald Petersen and Chrysler's Lee Iacocca.
   A group representing dealers in imported vehicles, however,
estimated the higher duty would directly add $500 million a year to
the cost of buying cars in the United States.
   ``This is a $500 million new tax, in effect,'' said Bart Fisher,
attorney for the American International Automobile Dealers
Association.
   The association's president, Robert McElwaine, estimated the
higher import duty would add on average $2,500 to the price of each
vehicle. About 200,000 imported vehicles a year would be affected,
McElwaine said.

<NOTE>US Reviewing West German Chemical Deal</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal panel is reviewing the proposed sale
of a California high-technology company to a West German chemical
firm.
   The case involves the proposed sale of Monsanto Electronic
Materials of Palo Alto, Calif., to Huels AG of West Germany. The
review marks the first test of a new law that allows the president
to block foreign purchases of U.S. companies on national security
grounds.
   The American company, an operating division of the giant Monsanto
chemical company headquartered in St. Louis, produces silicon
wafers, the flat discs used to make computer chips.
   Silicon wafers are the building blocks for the semiconductor
industry, a sector of the U.S. economy considered vital not only for
national security reasons but also for trade reasons.
   The proposed sale to the West German company was reviewed in a
closed-door meeting on Tuesday by the Committee on Foreign
Investment. The committee is composed of officials from eight
government agencies and is headed by David C. Mulford, an assistant
Treasury secretary.
   The panel has until Monday to forward a recommendation to the
president. It is expected the proposed sale will be one of the first
trade issues that President-elect Bush will have to face.

<NOTE>Pentagon Buying Old MiGs on Open Market</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says it has been buying older
Soviet-designed jet fighters and other Russian weapons on the open
market for the past year to test their effectiveness and to train
American servicemen.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi said the purchases began in
early 1988 and so far have involved buying from international arms
dealers or private citizens Soviet MiG-15, 17 and 21 jet fighters.
   The Defense Department also has bought Soviet air-defense
equipment such as radar systems with a view toward better training
American pilots, she added.
   The U.S. military has long conducted tests and experiments with
military equipment made in the Soviet Union, Warsaw Pact and Third
World countries and later captured, stolen or covertly purchased.
   The Pentagon had not acknowledged previously, however, that
efforts are now made to buy Soviet weaponry in an open manner in the
world's arms bazaars rather than to keep such transactions secret.
   Last September, the Pentagon announced the creation of a new
organization known as the Mobile Operational Test Force, set up by
the Pentagon's Operational Test and Evaluation Office, that receives
the Soviet equipment being purchased. Reporters were later allowed
to watch the new organization test some Soviet-bloc equipment at
Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M.

<HEAD>Mixed Reactions In Kokomo To TV's `Ryan White Story'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KOKOMO, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The television movie ``The Ryan White Story''
got mixed reviews from the players in the real saga the hemophiliac
boy who was barred from school after being diagnosed with AIDS.
   The Hollywood version, starring George C. Scott, Judith Light and
Lukas Haas, was broadcast Monday night on ABC.
   ``If the purpose of the film was to portray Ryan, his family and
his feelings, then I am sure it was accurate as they saw it,'' said
Ron Colby, principal of Western Middle School, which barred Ryan
from attending after he was diagnosed with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in December 1984.
   ``I thought George C. Scott played a nice Charlie Vaughan (Ryan's
attorney) and Lukas Haas reminded me a lot of Ryan. The film
captured the relentless pressure applied to all by the media.''
   But David Rosselot, the attorney for parents who sought to keep
Ryan out of school, called the film ``a subtle insult to the
community as a whole simply because it left the impression that the
community was anti-Ryan White, when in the proper context, it was
not anti-Ryan White, but anti-AIDS in the classroom.''
   The 17-year-old Ryan, who appeared on ABC's Good Morning America
on Monday, said people in Kokomo were apprehensive about how the
movie would depict them, but their behavior was much worse than the
movie lets on.
   Charles Vaughn, Ryan's attorney, said the movie was accurate but
he wished the courtroom scenes had distinguished the difference
between the White family's case against the local school
corporation, which initially sought to bar Ryan, and the injunction
against the boy won by other parents.
   Ryan's family eventually prevailed in both battles, but they have
since moved south to Cicero and Ryan is attending Hamilton Heights
High School in Arcadia.
   Vaughan said the movie ``was very good to Kokomo.''
   ``They better not complain,'' he said. ``I could fill a book with
the conduct of the Western School Corporation.''
   A Western official who was school board president at the time did
not watch the movie.
   ``I'm a high school graduate. I know the meaning of the word
fiction,'' said Don Carter.

<HEAD>Diplomats Report Busy Soviet Withdrawal; Fresh Ammo for Afghans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet planes delivered tons of arms
and ammunition to the Moscow-backed Afghan government last week and
lifted Red Army troops out of Kabul at twice the usual rate,
diplomats say.
   At the current pace, the Red Army's withdrawal could be completed
by the end of January, Western diplomats in Islamabad said Tuesday.
   ``However, for political reasons the Russians may wish to keep a
military presence in Kabul up to Feb. 15,'' said one.
   Under a U.N.-brokered accord, Moscow has pledged to remove its
remaining troops from Afghanistan by that date, although Kabul's
ruling Marxists have not reached a settlement with the Moslem
insurgents who have battled them for more than a decade.
   The Soviets, who intervened in December 1979, are demanding a
role in a post-war government for members of the current regime.
   But the guerrillas, most of whom are based in bordering Pakistan,
reject any power-sharing and, according to a U.N. official, will
convene a meeting of a 500-member council by Feb. 1 in an attempt to
form a transitional government.
   Benon Sevan, who has been shuttling between Kabul and Pakistan
seeking a political settlement, told a news conference at U.N.
headquarters in New York on Tuesday that the conference's
composition is still under discussion.
   The Western diplomats, who spoke on condition they not be
identified further, said takeoffs and landings of Soviet IL-76
transport planes at Kabul airport numbered about 40 between Jan. 9
and 14, or twice the usual rate.
   Soviet troops were seen boarding the planes after Afghan troops
unloaded tons of military equipment and ammunition.
   As many as 18 SS-1 ``Scud'' missiles were transported from the
airport during the period, according to diplomats and Western
journalists.
   Soviet armor has been digging into new positions north of the
Hindukush mountains along the snowbound Salang Road, which runs some
240 miles from Kabul north to the Soviet Union, the sources said.
   The road is a principal evacuation route for Red Army troops.
   The sources said that judging by convoys arriving in Kabul,
Soviet-Afghan forces apparently have been able to keep the route
open despite harassment by the insurgents.
   Diplomats said workers have been busy cutting down trees and
leveling earth along the avenue that runs past the Afghan Defense
Ministry and the Soviet Embassy in southern Kabul. One source
speculated the workers were preparing an emergency airstrip next to
the Soviet mission.
   Moscow and Kabul continue to accuse Islamabad and Washington of
violating the pullout accord by continuing to arm and supply the
rebels, many of whom operate from bases in Pakistan.

<HEAD>Little Leaguer Helps Team To Victory Despite Fatal Tumor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LINCOLN, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen-year-old Eddy Melucci knew he had a
fatal brain tumor, but insisted on playing one more game with his
Little League baseball team before he died.
   The team won the championship. Eddy died Sunday, a few months
later.
   ``I visited him in the hospital 22 days before our first game,
and he told me he was going to play,'' said Randy Hien, Eddy's coach
and manager of the Tigers. ``I half believed him, but he was back at
practice the day before our first game, and he had two hits opening
day.''
   Eddy, who was diagnosed with the tumor last spring, decided to
return to the baseball diamond less than a month after an operation.
   Eddy, normally a third baseman and pitcher, was kept in the
outfield until his reaction time returned to normal. He had to wear
a 15-pound helmet in the early weeks following March's surgery.
   ``We were dealing with a really tough kid who could handle
anything mentally,'' said Russell Fiore, safety director for the
Lincoln Little League and designer of the helmet. ``He was a kid who
just wouldn't quit.''
   ``He made his own decisions: when to have the operation and to
die at home,'' Eddy's mother, Patricia Melucci, said Monday.
   The operation would have left Eddy with five to 15 years to live
if successful, said his father, Edward Melucci. But Eddy fell ill in
Novemeber, and doctor's revised their prognosis to six months.
   Sitting on the Meluccis' kitchen table Monday were the three
baseball awards Eddy won last summer: his league championship
trophy, a smaller trophy for making the league All-Star team that
played in the state tournament, and the Ray Banville Award, the
Lincoln Little League's most prestigious award.
   Inscribed on the Banville plaque are the words ``Performance,
Attitude, Loyalty, Effort.''
   ``He epitomized American youth. He was a parent's dream,'' said
Mrs. Melucci.

   A man on parole for two bank robberies
tried to flee when police on the New Jersey Turnpike stopped the car
he was in, but he was shot to death when he grabbed for an officer's
gun, authorities said.
   Police found 5{ ounces of cocaine on the man, whose name was
being withheld until relatives were notified.
   The driver of the car was arrested during the incident Tuesday,
and a second passenger was being sought by state and local police on
foot and in helicopters, said state police spokesman Capt. Thomas
Gallagher.
   State Police Trooper Robert K. Henig, 26, pulled the car over for
speeding and told one of the passengers to get out and show some
identification, Gallagher said.
   Henig spotted what he believed to be a bag of marijuana while the
man was looking for identification, Gallagher said. The bag later
turned out to be cocaine, police said.
   The man then pushed Henig down and started to run into a marshy
highway median, Gallagher said. Henig caught him and was putting his
gun into his holster when the man kicked him, Gallagher said.
   ``There were a number of shots fired,'' Gallagher said. ``When
the weapon was turned toward the trooper, a shot was fired. He then
turned the gun on the suspect and fired.''
   One of the people in the car had fled when Henig returned.
   The driver, Bernard Hicks, 37, of Greensboro, N.C., was charged
with speeding and driving with an expired driver's license,
Gallagher said. He was given two tickets and released.
   The dead man was tentatively identified as a 46-year-old former
North Carolina resident who moved to Hackensack in October,
Gallagher said.
   He was convicted of two bank robberies in North Carolina in 1976
and later paroled.

<HEAD>Report Says Britain One Of Europe's Filthiest Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain has become one of Europe's filthiest
nations, its city streets a jungle of garbage and graffiti, the
government-funded Royal Fine Arts Commission said in a report today.
   ``London is filthy, worse than comparable cities in mainland
Europe,'' says the report, which blames the problem on a growing
lack of personal discipline.
   ``The same is true of Britain as a whole, as children chuck away
sweet (candy) wrappers and ice lolly wrappings, and adults calmly
wind down car windows and dispatch empty cans as well as squashed
paper packets as they speed to their presumably well-kept homes or
places of work,'' it says.
   The author, commission urban affairs specialist Judy Hillman,
said that although the report, entitled ``A New Look for London,''
concentrates on the capital, the problems affect all of Britain.
   The report describes street gutters filled with empty beverage
cans and old newspapers; plastic garbage sacks dumped around
lampposts, often spilling their contents on to the sidewalk; and
roadsides lined with discarded mattresses, broken chairs, old
stoves, abandoned supermarket carts and other trash.
   Other complaints were of overflowing litter bins; remains of
fast-food meals strewn around shopping malls; and dog and pigeon
excrement on sidewalks and in public parks.
   The report also noted graffiti on trains, the London subway,
buses and in ``ill-designed areas of urban residential wilderness
and almost any convenient blank stone or painted wall.''
   It said people increasingly ``graze'' in and around shopping
malls, eating on the move and dropping food and wrappers on the way.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a foreword to the report,
wrote of the need for residents of all the country's municipalities
to ``involve themselves in the upkeep and improvement of their local
streets and centers.''
   The report recommends that the banks of the River Thames be
turned into a national park. Legislation covering officially
designated national parks imposes rigorous controls on the
collection of garbage and similar matters.
   In July 1986, government ministers and pop music entrepreneur
Richard Branson launched a $40 million drive using taxpayers' money
to clean up Britain's streets, countryside and derelict industrial
land.
   But Londoners and foreign visitors say there has been little
evidence that the project has had much effect.
   The Royal Fine Arts Commission was first set up in 1924 to advise
government departments on projects and developments affecting
national or public amenities.

than during the previous 78 years, yet the deadly peaks are
inadequately monitored to protect 350 million people who live near
their slopes, a geologist says.
   ``We have to do a better job of studying the volcanoes of the
world,'' said Robert Tilling, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist who
coordinated the agency's response to the Mount St. Helens eruption.
   ``Existing methods of monitoring volcanoes are proving relatively
reliable. We just don't do enough of it.''
   Since A.D. 1000 more than 300,000 people died from volcanic flows
_ lava, pyroclastic or mud _ tsunamis and post-eruption starvation,
Tilling said in a summary of his remarks for today's annual meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Mudflows from Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz killed at least 22,000
people in 1985, while more than 2,000 perished in pyroclastic flows
_ blasts of hot gas, rock and ash _ from Mexico's El Chichon in
1982, Tilling said. Mount St. Helens left 57 people dead or missing.
   In 1902, pyroclastic flows killed 29,000 near Mount Pelee in
Martinique, 6,000 near Santa Maria volcano in Guatemala, and 1,560
in the eruption of Soufriere on St. Vincent, said Tilling, who is
based in Washington, D.C.
   His count shows 13,080 more died during the six other deadly
eruptions this century: three volcanoes in 1951 and three others in
1911, 1919 and 1963.
   An average of 50 of Earth's 600 volcanoes erupt each year, most
without fatalities, and the rate ``has not changed much in
historical times. But because the world population has exploded ...
to 5 billion in 1987, the problem posed by volcanic and associated
hazards is greater now than ever before,'' he said.
   He said more than 350 millon people live on or within danger
range of volcanoes _ about 14 percent of the population.
   ``We spend a lot of effort at a few volcanoes _ and we need to,''
Tilling said in an interview. ``But we're not applying existing
(monitoring) technology to more volcanoes, especially in developing
countries where the risks and hazards are the greatest.''
   And, he said, the most dangerous volcanoes are the least studied.
   Part of the problem, Tilling said, is that volcanoes erupt
infrequently compared with natural hazards such as earthquakes,
major storms, floods and landslides.
   ``However in populated areas, even very small eruptions can wreak
havoc and cause widespread devastation'' such as the Nevado del Ruiz
eruption.
   The mountain blew out only 3 percent as much ash as Mount St.
Helens' May 18, 1980, explosion. But the tiny Colombian eruption
melted glacial ice, burying Armero and other towns under mudflows,
he said.
   Tilling urged an international effort to reduce volcano deaths.
The National Academy of Science and United Nations previously have
endorsed an international scientific effort for the 1990s designated
the International Decade for Natural Hazards Reduction.
   To reduce volcano deaths, scientists must identify high-risk
mountains, study their geology to learn how often eruptions occur
and whether the eruptions were explosive, map the routes of killer
flows to identify danger zones, then install monitoring equipment
where necessary to listen for earthquakes, uplift and tilting, and
other signs of activity.
   Asked who should pay the bill for better volcano monitoring,
Tilling replied: ``There's the question.''
   Tilling said the 10 most deadly eruptions since A.D. 1000 were:
   _Tambora, Indonesia, 1815, 92,000 deaths, including 80,000 from
starvation.
   _Krakatau, Indonesia, 1883, 36,420 killed by tsunamis, or
volcanic tidal waves.
   _Mount Pelee, Martinique, 1902, 29,000 dead.
   _Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia, 1985, at least 22,000.
   _Vesuvius, Italy, 1631, 18,000 killed.
   _Unzen, Japan, 1792, 15,190 tsunami deaths.
   _Etna, Italy, 1169, 15,000 fatalities.
   _Kelut, Indonesia, 1586, 10,000 killed.
   _Etna again in 1669, 10,000 more victims.
   _Lakagigar, Iceland, 1783, 9,340 lives lost.

   Sikh militants raided a village in
northern Punjab and shot and killed a Hindu family of four, police
said today.
   About five Sikh gunmen raided the home of Anant Ram in Bhurhe
Gill, 30 miles south of Amritsar, at midnight Tuesday and killed
four members of his family, police chief G.S. Mann said.
   Ram and his two sons were killed inside a room and the assailants
shot and killed Vinod Kumar, a relative of Ram, when tried to resist
the attack, Mann said.
   Sikhs, who make up two percent of India's 880 million people,
allege they are discriminated against by the Hindus, at 80 percent
of the populace the country's religious majority. Sikhs are,
however, in majority in Punjab, a rich farming state bordering
Pakistan.
   Sikh militants have been campaigning since 1982 for an
independent homeland in Punjab. The latest slayings brought the
death toll blamed on the militants this year to 120. Last year 2,400
deaths were blamed on the militants.

<HEAD>Researcher Predicts Availability of Fat that's Safe for the Heart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eggs, beef and other tasty dishes
considered bad for the heart can be made healthy by replacing the
dangerous fats in those foods with safe ones, a top researcher
predicts.
   Almost every sensible eating plan advocated by health groups
calls for cutting out fat in order to avoid the saturated fat that
contributes to heart disease and to prevent overweight.
   But while such diets may be healthy, they usually mean skimping
on the meat, ice cream, pastries and other tasty things most
Americans think are good food.
   ``For Americans, low-fat diets are not close to reality. They
find low-fat diets unpalatable,'' said Dr. Scott M. Grundy, who
described his work Tuesday at a meeting of the American Heart
Association.
   Grundy, co-author of past dietary statements by the association
and director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, has been searching for
safe fats that can take place of the dangerous ones Americans like
so much.
   Typically, sensible eating plans urge people to restrict fat
intake to 30 percent of their total daily intake of calories, and
suggest that fat consumption be divided roughly equally between the
three major kinds: saturated, polunsaturated and monounsaturated.
   Saturated fat is found in relatively high quantities in meat and
foods that contain butter fat or palm oil. The body converts this
fat to cholesterol, and it clogs the arteries that supply the heart,
leading to heart attacks.
   Grundy said two imporant substitutes for saturated fat should be
monounsaturated fat and stearic acid.
   Monounsaturated fat is found in olive oil, canola oil and some
forms of safflower oil and sunflower seed oil. Grundy's studies have
shown that eating monounsaturates will lower the body's levels of
low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol that
contributes to heart disease. But unlike polyunsaturated fat, it
does not lower HDL, the good cholesterol that protects people from
heart trouble.
   Stearic acid is found in meat and other foods. While it is a
saturated fat, Grundy's work has shown that it does not raise
cholesterol. He said that it should take the place of palm oil in
margarine and shortening.
   Other research shows that a sterol, or an unsaturated alcohol,
produced by plants can be added to eggs, preventing the body from
absorbing the cholesterol in egg yolks, Grundy said.
   Fat substitutes are also being developed that are entirely
calorie-free, and meat producers are starting to raise low-fat beef.
   This does not mean, however, that people will be able to eat fat
with abandon, Grundy said.
   ``Fat contains more calories than carbohydrates,'' he said.
``This could backfire if people see it as a license to eat fat and
get fat.''
   On the other hand, he said, some people may find it easier to
keep their weight down on a higher-fat diet, because this food
satisfies their hunger better and thus they eat less.
   Grundy said the recommendation that fat consumption be held to 30
percent of total calories is still a good general guideline, but
that it doesn't have to be the rule for everyone.
   ``Some individuals may prefer higher fat intakes without concern
for detrimental effect,'' he said.

   Children whose families escaped the
horrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard turned into a
killing field, the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and
a pistol bearing the word ``victory.''
   After the massacre at recess, the bodies of three Southeast Asian
children were outlined in blue on the playground of Cleveland
Elementary School where they died. Two others had been dragged by
teachers inside to a classroom, but also died. Twenty-nine other
pupils were wounded, along with a teacher.
   ``There was shooting all over. ... I was scared,'' said
sixth-grader Binh Hoang, who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in the
final days of war and had never before heard gunfire. ``Everybody
was crying in my class.''
   Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26,
armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle, entered the
school grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 rounds
before he shot himself to death.
   Afterward, a large handgun and the assault rifle lay on the
ground near a pool of blood and the gunman's body. The word
``victory'' was written on the pistol handle.
   Binh said she was sitting in math class when the shooting began
outside the wood-and-stucco school building. Her teacher told
students to get under their desks.
   The gunfire startled Michael Cuevas, whose first thought was that
the University of the Pacific fraternities near his house were
firing their miniature cannon again.
   But the shots repeated too rapidly for a cannon, and the scream
of sirens that followed told him this time was no prank.
   ``I never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen in
Stockton,'' said Cuevas, a 29-year-old marine clerk at the Port of
Stockton who lives down the street from the elementary school.
   ``It's always in some other town, some other place. It's a shock
to my senses. I don't think it's even hit me as hard as it's going
to. You don't know whether to be excited, or confused or what.''
   Police cars and news reporters crowded the street, which
typically is busy only when parents pick up and drop off their
children.
   ``Why here?'' said Jeff Russell, 37, who was born and reared in
the neighborhood. ``This has always been a sleepy little town. (The
shooting) put us back on the map.''
   Lutheran and Baptist churches border the school in a neighborhood
of ranch-style homes, postage-stamp lawns and streets lined with
sycamore and oak trees in this agricultural city of 150,000 people
60 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   The 40-year-old neighborhood near the University of the Pacific
is still home to many retired couples who raised their familes
there. But the city has been changing with the influx of Southeast
Asian refugees.
   When school officials called clergy to console grieving families,
Buddhist priests in sandals and saffron robes arrived along with
their white-collared Christian counterparts.
   About 60 percent of Cleveland Elementary's students are of
Southeast Asian descent, said John Klose, spokesman for the Stockton
School District. The five children who were killed were Vietnamese
and Cambodian.
   ``This is one of our best neighborhood schools,'' Klose said.
``Of all of our schools that I would think of something like this
happening, this would be the last one I would think of.''
   Across the street, Sarah Abbott stood astride her bicycle and
gazed at the school where she graduated ``many years ago.'' The
professional nanny said she was at the house of her 97-year-old
grandfather about a block from the school when the gunman set his
car on fire before starting to shoot.
   ``When the car exploded, my grandpa's house just shook,'' Abbott
said. ``It scared me. ... It was just too close.''

<TEXT>
   Multimillionaire Robert Hearin has paid $1
million in ransom and spent six anguish-filled months awaiting word
on his kidnapped wife, and neighbors say it might be time to accept
she'll never return.
   ``For fear of sounding callous, I don't want to say that. But yet
I think as time goes by, people are becoming increasingly despondent
about the chances'' of solving 73-year-old Annie Laurie Hearin's
disappearance, Julia Yandell said Tuesday.
   Yandall and others in Jackson's posh Woodland Hills neighborhood
have been on edge since July 26, when Mrs. Hearin was abducted from
her home.
   FBI agents also aren't as optimistic as they were a few months
ago.
   ``We're pursuing leads. New things develop all the time, but
nothing at this time looks real promising,'' said FBI agent Stewart
Murphy.
   Murphy said he couldn't discuss the case while it's still being
investigated, but said police are hoping something will come of
Hearin's Sept. 8 offer of a $100,000 reward for information leading
to his wife's safe return.
   Hearin, 70, who may be the wealthiest man in Mississippi, has
shunned publicity most of his life, and his name was virtually
unknown until his wife, who he met before World War II, was
kidnapped.
   At an Aug. 7 news conference he pleaded for her return, and
family members were interviewed on a Nov. 9 segment of the NBC
television program ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' which generated about 300
calls that didn't pan out.
   ``The Hearin family very much appreciates your interest, but they
don't have any comment at this time,'' a spokeswoman said Tuesday
when asked if Hearin, his son and daughter plan any new appeals.
   Hearin, worth an estimated $200 million, controls Mississippi's
largest gas distribution company, Mississippi Valley Gas Co.; its
second-largest bank, Trustmark National Bank; and its second-largest
insurance company, Lamar Life Corp.
   Ironically, the kidnapper's vague note demanded that an
unspecified amount of money be given to 12 former franchise owners
sued by School Pictures Inc., one of Hearin's more obscure
businesses.
   A letter with an Atlanta postmark, received Aug. 15, is the only
message Mrs. Hearin's family has received. The letter urged Hearin
to comply with the demands.
   Hearin paid a total of about $1 million on Aug. 16 to the 12
people _ most of whom returned the money. But investigators never
heard from the kidnapper again.
   Neighbors say there was a time when publicity was welcome
ammunition in the fight to find their friend. But there comes a time
when the memory of the well-liked society matron should be left in
peace _ and they say perhaps that time is here.
   ``I don't think _ the neighbors don't think _ there's much hope
after all this time of finding her alive. She's a very frail
person,'' said one neighbor, who has known Mrs. Hearin ``for about
at least 30 or 40 years.''
   Mrs. Hearin suffers from ileitis, a chronic inflammation of the
small intestines, which could be fatal if she doesn't receive daily
steroid medication, officials have said.
   The long-time friend, who asked that her name not be published,
said she felt Hearin's ordeal has been made more painful by
continuing attention from the media.
   ``It would be better to leave him alone,'' she said.

<HEAD>Bail For Man Accused In Nerve Gas Plot Set At $2 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Korean-American businessman accused of
trying to buy deadly nerve gas for export was held on $2 million
bail after a prosecutor argued the man might flee to his high-level
contacts overseas.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer said Juwhan Yun, 49,
``bragged that he had close personal contacts with high-ranking
civilian and military officials in many countries,'' including
Yugoslavia, the People's Republic of China and South Korea.
   U.S. magistrate Ronald Hedges set the $2 million figure at a bail
hearing Tuesday for Yun of Short Hills. Yun had not posted bail as
of Tuesday night, and his lawyer said he will ask the man's friends
to help.
   Hedges imposed strict travel restrictions, ordered Yun's family
to surrender their passports and forbade Yun to make overseas
contacts should bail be met.
   Yun was arrested Thursday and charged with conspiring to
illegally export the nerve gas sarin, possibly to Iran. The
complaint said Yun also discussed acquiring anti-aircraft and
anti-tank missiles and military radar equipment with an undercover
agent.
   Yun has pleaded innocent.
   The magistrate said that even though the crime was not a violent
one, it was serious enough to merit high bail.
   ``If true, (the charge) certainly demonstrates an attempt by the
defendant to profit from death to others,'' Hedges said.
   Yun's lawyer, Stephen N. Dratch, said he hoped Yun's friends
might be willing to post their property as surety. Yun owns a
$400,000 New York City condominium and lives in a $650,000 house but
had a total equity _ excluding mortgages _ of only $350,000, which
Hedges said could go toward the bail.
   Dratch said Yun earned $150,000 a year from his import-export
business. Hedges said he doubted Yun could support a wife, three
children, extensive travel and $64,800 in yearly mortgage payments
on that amount.
   Ms. Singer added that Yun had recently bought a new luxury car.
   Yun entered the courtroom shackled. His wife sat in the second
row, her hands clasped in her lap and her eyes closed through most
of the hearing.
   Ms. Singer disclosed that Yun had sought to acquire Mark 19-3
grenade launchers during the seven months of negotiations with the
undercover agent. The 40 mm weapon, acquired by the Army five years
ago, can fire up to 375 grenades a minute.
   When the arrest was announced, officials said Iran at one point
was identified as the nerve gas's destination, but that was not
verified and no foreign government officials appeared to be involved.
   Ms. Singer told Hedges that Yun was planning an around-the-world
trip in January to Beijing, Iran, Europe and South Korea. Also, she
identified as French citizens two men who met with Yun and an
accused co-conspirator in London over the nerve gas deal.
   Authorities have said they were trying to identify the men, who
were under surveillance at the meeting.
   A warrant has been issued for the second man, Charles Caplan of
London. Authorities said they were considering the possibility of
seeking his extradition.
   Dratch said Yun came to the United States in 1972 and was
naturalized six years later after receiving a master's degree from
the American Graduate School of International Management. He founded
his business, Komex International Corp. of Summit, in San Francisco
in 1980.

   Radical students carrying sledgehammers
attacked and damaged a U.S. cultural center today in Kwangju,
hurling firebombs and rocks and attempting to burn down the
building, authorities said.
   Police in the southern provincial city said about 50 students
rushed into the compound yelling anti-American slogans and threw
stones and about 50 firebombs. They said about 15 protesters climbed
onto the roof and tried to start a fire.
   ``Drive out Yankee imperialists,'' attackers chanted during the
attack in the city 180 miles south of Seoul.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Seoul said no one was injured in the
attack and the protesters did not get inside the cultural center. He
said 30 windows were broken, one official vehicle was damaged and
tiles were ripped from the roof when attackers tried to set the
building on fire.
   Parts of the building and a police post were damaged by
firebombs, the U.S. spokesman said.
   At least one U.S. official was in the building at the time, but
the staff locked the doors and waited to be rescued, the spokesman
said. The police who routinely guard the building were too few to
stop the attack, he said.
   Riot police drove the attackers off with tear gas and arrested
two who had scaled the roof and were shouting slogans through a
bullhorn, police officials said. The other attackers fled, they said.
   The attackers also denounced President Roh Tae-woo, chanting,
``Down with Roh Tae-woo.''
   The attackers unfurled a banner on the roof saying, ``Punish Roh
Tae-woo and the Yankees, the enemies of our nation.''
   About 100 other students watched and applauded the attackers, but
did not take part and were dispersed when riot police arrived, the
officials said.
   Police said the attackers were from Chonnam University in Kwangju.
   The attack came shortly after about 200 students battled riot
police with firebombs at Chosun University in Kwangju, police said.
Riot police fired tear gas to disperse the radicals in that
incident, they said.
   The Kwangju center is operated by the U.S. Information Service to
sponsor cultural activities and serve as an information center for
the United States. It provides a library and other facilities to
residents.
   The incident came the day after Roh told a nationally televised
news conference that U.S. troops must remain in the country until
peace is achieved with communist North Korea.
   Radical students have staged a series of attacks on U.S.
diplomatic buildings in recent months, demanding an end to American
influence in South Korea and withdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops
based in the nation under a mutual defense treaty.
   The radicals, who have little public support, claim the United
States has backed military rule in South Korea and Washington keeps
troops in the south to block unification with North Korea.
   U.S. officials have said American forces will remain in South
Korea as long as their presence is deemed necessary by South Korean
leaders.
   American forces have been based in the country since the United
States intervened to help the south against the North Korean
invasion that triggered the 1950-53 Korean War.

<TEXT>
   Snow fell along part of the nation's northern tier, with up to 8
inches recorded in Wisconsin, while rain was scattered along the
northern Pacific Coast and in Texas.
   Strong gusty winds continued to buffet the eastern slopes of the
Rockies in Montana, and a high wind warning was in effect this
morning for the upper Yellowstone Valley in the state.
   A low pressure system generated snow from eastern North Dakota to
upper Michigan Tuesday. Wisconsin got the brunt of the snowfall,
with up to 8 inches blanketing Douglas County in the state's
northwest corner.
   Clouds extended over the Great Lakes and New England, and
scattered snow dusted New England.
   A storm system at sea spread showers along the northern Pacific
Coast and extended cloud cover to the northern Rockies. Quillayute,
Wash., received 1.21 inches of rain in the six hours ended at 1 a.m.
EST.
   Light rain also fell in southern Texas.
   Today's forecast called for widespread snow in northeast
Minnesota, upper Michigan and northern portions of New York and
Vermont. Scattered rain was expected from southeast Wisconsin into
northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, along the western and
central Gulf Coast and along the northern Pacific Coast. Fair
weather was forecast for the remainder of the nation.
   Highs were expected in the 20s and 30s from the upper Mississippi
Valley through the Great Lakes to New England, and in much of Idaho,
Utah and Nevada; in the 60s from the southern Atlantic Coast through
the lower Mississippi Valley into central and southern Texas, in
southern portions of Nevada and California, and in the valleys of
northern California; in the 70s along the Southern California coast,
the desert Southwest and in northern and central Florida; and around
80 degrees across southern Florida.
   The rest of the nation could expect highs in the 40s and 50s.
   At 2 a.m. EST, temperatures ranged from 3 degrees below zero at
Craig, Colo., to 72 degrees at Key West, Fla.

   The investigation of the 1980
assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero will continue despite the
Supreme Court's refusal to extradite a former army captain
implicated in the murder, says President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   He told reporters on Tuesday during a visit to a downtown
hospital construction site that the government has continued trying
to solve the case and ``we will continue as far as we can.''
   ``The case definitely is not closed,'' Justice Minister Julio
Alfredo Samayoa said in a telephone interview.
   Some believe the case was effectively closed last month when the
country's highest court refused to extradite former Capt. Alvaro
Saravia from the United States. In 1987, Duarte's administration
accused Saravia of arranging the assassination of Romero, who was
slain while saying Mass in March 1980.
   During his weekly homilies, Romero had called on soldiers and
security forces to halt the then-rampant murders of suspected
leftists.
   Duarte alleges Saravia acted on orders from Roberto D'Aubuisson,
a cashiered army intelligence major and leader of the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance political party, known as Arena.
   D'Aubuisson allegedly directed right-wing death squads in the
early 1980s, but denies any link to death squads and any
responsibility in Romero's murder.
   Arena accuses the Christian Democrats of bringing up the case
before every election in an effort to erode its electoral base. El
Salvador holds presidential elections March 19. Arena, which won
legislative and municipal elections in last March, leads the
Christian Democrats in recent polls.
   Saravia, 46, was freed Thursday from the Miami jail where he had
spent 13 months awaiting resolution of the extradition request and
illegal immigration charges pending against him. He lives in the
Miami suburb of Kendall, and his attorney said he is seeking
political asylum.
   The Salvadoran Supreme Court ruled Dec. 19 that testimony linking
Saravia to the assassination was not credible.

   A piece of radioactive iridium missing from a
construction site wound up in a welder's home in the eastern Chinese
city of Nanking and contaminated at least 14 people, a newspaper
reported today.
   One man was hospitalized with third-degree radiation burns on his
left leg but there was no sign of harm to the other 13 people, the
pro-Beijing Chinese-language Wen Wei Po said.
   The Iridium-192, which emits beta and gamma radiation, was found
missing Dec. 22 from a Nanking construction site, the newspaper said.
   It said the material resembled a stick used to beat what the
Chinese call a ``wooden fish,'' a popular percussion instrument made
of a hollow wooden block.
   Police and health authorities immediately began searching for the
iridium with radiation monitoring equipment, which picked up a
signal Dec. 27 from the home of welder Wang Fuqiang.
   Many people had been to Wang's home to view his new color
television and electronic games, and up to 47 people may have been
exposed to the material, the report said.
   Wang was hospitalized with a leg injury after receiving what the
newspaper described as a ``small dose'' of radiation. The newspaper
said his life was not in danger. It did not say how the material was
being used at the construction site or what Wang was doing with it.
   Wen Wei Po said authorities were investigating the incident.

   State agencies last year investigated more than
11,000 cases of human rights violations in China, including torture,
illegal arrests and unwarranted search and seizure, the nation's
leading newspaper reported today.
   In an unusual report, the People's Daily said more than 50
high-ranking officials, 2,600 government workers, including
policemen, and 1,250 employees of collective enterprises committed
such violations.
   The story cited an example of Officer Wang Xiugang, a policeman
from Hengyang, a city in Hunan province, who took bribes to have
criminals released from jail.
   Wang traveled to Canton province nine times and secured the
release of 36 prisoners using bogus letters of introduction, the
paper said. For his services, he was bribed $1,784 _ or about 50
times the average Chinese police officer's monthly salary, the paper
said.
   Last year, Wang was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in jail.
   The report said that of the 11,300 cases investigated last year,
4,454 involved wrongful charges, forced confessions, torture,
illegal arrests and unwarranted search and seizure. Other cases
concerned dereliction of duty and using one's office for profit, it
said.
   One of the cases cited was a fire in Daxinganling in northeastern
China in May 1987 which left 193 people dead and millions of acres
burned. In all, 11 people were sentenced to prison terms for
dereliction of duty.
   One official involved ordered fire trucks to protect his own
house while the fire ravaged an oil depot and a grain warehouse, the
report said. Another official, at the time the head of a fire
prevention bureau, fled the fire on a motorcycle, it said.
   The article was unusual in that it openly mentioned torture,
forced confessions and illegal search and seizure. It also
acknowledged that many of the cases were difficult to crack because
``those prosecuted were government workers.''
   China has acknowledged that torture and other breaches of human
rights were frequent during the 10-year ultra-leftist Cultural
Revolution that ended in 1976.
   Little criticism has since been tolerated of the state's internal
security bureaus, though lawyers say several Chinese have recently
sued the police for wrongful arrest and won. Later this year, the
government is expected to come out with legislation allowing
citizens to sue other government bureaus.
   Chinese lawyers say they are working to raise people's
consciousness of their rights. Recent cases, such as that of two
models who sued the prestigious Central Academy of Fine Arts, are
being widely publicized to teach people about invasion of privacy
and other rights.
   The models are suing because they said the academy used pictures
of them in an exhibition of nudes without asking their permission.
The case has yet to be decided.
   Discussion of rights breaks down, however, when political
freedoms are raised. The government clearly states that no criticism
of the Communist Party or socialism is allowed.
   ``We are trying to set a foundation,'' said one lawyer in a
recent interview. ``It would be asking too much for China to grant
political freedoms at this point.''

   Rioting that left at least three blacks dead came as
Miami was trying to absorb 200 asylum-seeking Nicaraguans a day and
coincided with the city's hopes to polish its tarnished image with
the Super Bowl.
   Tensions have been simmering among some blacks over what they
perceive as unjust treatment from police and feelings of frustration
concerning the attention given to the Nicaraguan newcomers,
community leaders said.
   The hoopla over the Super Bowl _ with the city showing off its
new skyline, new bayside attractions and improved image _ may have
added to the disaffection. The fatal shooting of a 23-year-old black
motorcyclist by a white police officer Monday evening provided the
spark, they said.
   ``There have been a lot of other tensions the last few weeks.
They just needed a catalyst,'' said state Rep. James Burke, who
represents Miami. ``These people involved could care less about the
Super Bowl being here. It's not going to help their lives.''
   The motorcyclist's 24-year-old passenger died Tuesday afternoon,
and a young black man was shot to death early today as violence
spread from the poor Overtown section to Liberty City, about 30
blocks to the northwest.
   ``It's really close to what happened before in 1980,'' said Garth
Reeves, long-time publisher of the black-oriented newspaper Miami
Times, referring to the acquittal of Metro-Dade police officers
charged with beating a black man to death. The acquittals sparked
three days of riots that killed 18 people and caused hundreds of
millions of dollars in damage.
   The outbreak of violence in 1980 came as 125,000 Cuban refugees
were arriving in the Mariel boatlift.
   Willie Simms of the Community Relations Board said the warning
signs of this week's violence were apparent. He said his group keeps
a weekly ``tension chart'' and had voiced alarm in recent weeks when
it saw levels similar to 1980 and 1982.
   But, as in the past, perceptions of violence likely will linger
after the violence subsides.
   ``This really puts a damper on literally hundreds of thousands of
volunteer hours that have been put in by this community preparing
for the (Sunday's) Super Bowl,'' said Tom Ferguson, president of the
Beacon Council, which promotes Dade County.
   ``It's not that we have things that are any different from other
urban areas; it's just that the timing of how they occur is
absolutely incredible,'' he added. ``An incident like this you don't
ever want to happen, but it's just doubly unfortunate that it
happens this week.''
   Houston Post sports writer Ray Buck, whose car windshield was
shattered in Monday night's violence, said publicity about the
violence will cancel out Miami's hospitality this week.
   ``Unfortunately, I think a lot of good effort was ruined in one
short three- or four-hour period,'' he said. ``A year of hard work
went down the drain.''

   The debut of the Delta 2 space rocket
next month and that of the powerful Titan 4 a few weeks later
highlight the Air Force's busiest launch year here since 1983, an
official says.
   The Pentagon is counting on both rockets to help orbit a backlog
of about 25 national defense payloads that have been grounded since
the 1986 explosions of the space shuttle Challenger and an unpiloted
Titan 34D rocket.
   Problems that have held up the two launches for months are being
resolved, Air Force Col. Lawrence L. Gooch, commander of the Eastern
Space and Missile Center, told reporters Tuesday.
   The Delta 2 will carry two military navigation satellites on its
first flight Feb. 7 and the Titan 4, which will be America's most
powerful expendable rocket, will hoist a classified payload a few
weeks later, Gooch said.
   The 1989 launch schedule calls for seven military Delta 2s, two
commercial Delta 2s and one Delta 1; two Titan 4s, two smaller Titan
34Ds and two commercial Titan 3s; two commercial Atlas-Centaurs and
one with a Navy communications satellite; and six to eight submarine
test launches of the Navy's powerful new Trident 2 nuclear missile.
   The missile center also will support seven National Aeronautics
and Space Administration space shuttle launchings during 1989,
starting with Discovery on Feb. 23.
   The schedule of 32 to 34 launches would be the busiest here since
1983, when there were 60. There were 26 in 1987.
   Launch slippages and a shortage of manpower could hold the total
down, Gooch said. ``With luck we could support that rate, but if we
can get 70 percent up, we will have earned our pay.''
   The Air Force decided to build the Delta 2 and to significantly
increase its Titan 4 order after space shuttle Challenger exploded
on Jan. 26, 1986.
   The Pentagon and NASA had been phasing out unpiloted rockets and
had been putting all their launch eggs into one basket, the shuttle.
The Challenger disaster convinced officials that strategy had been a
mistake, and they ordered expendable rockets to ensure American
access to space.
   Gooch estimated 40 military, commercial and NASA space payloads
have backed up as a result of the 32-month standdown after the
shuttle accident and because of the Titan 34D grounding for several
months. About 25 of those are satellites vital to national defense,
he said.
   Cape Canaveral range may have problems supporting the schedule if
there are delays in a lot of the missions, Gooch said.
   A shortage of people to handle launches could be another problem,
Gooch said. The colonel said he has asked the Pentagon for about 100
people to add to the 200 he now has in his test operations group.

<HEAD>Journalists Take Government To Court Over Gag Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Journalists have taken the government to court over
a ban on broadcast interviews with supporters of terrorist groups in
Northern Ireland, saying the order is unlawful and restricts the
freedom of information.
   Permission to bring the suit before the High Court was granted
Tuesday ``with some hesitation,'' Lord Justice Sir Tasker Watkins
said. The full court hearing is expected by March.
   The ban ordered Oct. 19 by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd barred the
British Broadcasting Corp. and the Independent Broadcasting
Authority from carrying interviews with spokesmen for 11 groups,
including the IRA and its legal wing, Sinn Fein; the Ulster Defense
Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force.
   The suit is the first court challenge to the ban, and there have
been no prosecutions for violating it.
   Hurd's order, issued after an upsurge of IRA violence, also
banned the broadcast of words that supported, or invited support
for, the banned organizations. However, broadcasters remained free
to show pictures of the banned spokesmen and to paraphrase what they
said.
   The Irish Republican Army is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the province with
the Irish Republic, which is predominantly Roman Catholic.
   David Pannick, an attorney for the journalists and television
producers who sought to challenge the ban, argued that Hurd's order
was illegal.
   ``The directions are so perverse an interference with the free
flow of information in a democratic society that this restriction on
the freedom of expression is outside the discretionary powers which
were conferred upon the Secretary of State by Parliament,'' Pannick
said.
   The court case is part of a campaign coordinated by the National
Union of Journalists against the restrictions. It is the main trade
union representing press, radio, TV and magazine journalists in
Britain and Ireland.
   In November, the American Society of Newspaper Editors sent a
letter to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, protesting the ban.
   At the time the ban was announced, Hurd made it clear that the
IRA and Sinn Fein were the primary targets, and that his intention
was to deny them publicity.
   ``What people hear on television is not the Sinn Fein politicians
being grilled by journalists. What they hear is supporters of Sinn
Fein glorying in violence and death. That is what we propose to
stop,'' Hurd said.
   The challenge was brought by producers Don Brind of the BBC,
Victoria Leonard of the London Broadcasting Company and Alexander
Graham; broadcast journalists Fred Emery, John Pilger and Scarlett
McGwire, who is also joint president of the National Union of
Journalists, and union clerk Thomas Nash.
   In November, British authorities reportedly invoked the ban to
prevent broadcast of a song by the popular Irish folk group The
Pogues because its lyrics support 10 people convicted of IRA
bombings.
   The Observer, a London weekly, said Britain's Independent
Broadcasting Authority ordered all commercial radio stations not to
play the band's single ``Streets of Sorrow@Birmingham Six.''
   The High Court is third highest on Britain's legal ladder. The
highest court is the Law Lords of the House of Lords. Immediately
below that is the Court of Appeal.

   Patrick E. Purdy was a child alcoholic,
drifting loner and gun lover, but his grandmother says he had no
racial prejudice or other known motive to drive him to fire on a
crowded schoolyard with mostly Oriental children.
   Julia Chumbley believes the reason behind her grandson's assault
may have died with him when he took his own life Tuesday after using
an assault rifle to kill five children and wound 29 others in
Stockton, 15 miles south of here.
   ``I don't understand why and I probably won't ever know why,''
Chumbley, a 63-year-old retired cannery worker, told The Associated
Press. ``I'm shocked. It's just horrible.''
   Despite a troubled childhood and a long criminal record as an
adult, Purdy lacked racial prejudices against Asians or other
groups, hatreds or other outward signs that might have foreshadowed
the disaster, according to his grandmother.
   ``As far as I know, he was not prejudiced. We're not a prejudiced
family. We weren't raised that way,'' said Chumbley, who has lived
for three decades in this town in the farming-rich San Joaquin
Valley.
   ``When he was around here, he acted well,'' she said.
   Chumbley said her 26-year-old grandson, who also went by the
alias Patrick West, had only a normal interest in guns.
   ``All boys that age like guns,'' she said. ``It's normal for that
age, isn't it?''
   Purdy's father, Patrick Benjamin Purdy, a Lodi cab company
employee, was killed in September 1981 when he was struck by a car
as he was crossing a rural road. The death disturbed the younger
Purdy, but Chumbley said he seemed to have recovered from the loss.
   The elder Purdy also served in Vietnam, which did not seem to
have any apparent influence on the younger Purdy, she said.
   Chumbley also said that to her knowledge her grandson never
attended Cleveland Elementary School, where the attack took place. A
majority of the school's pupils are children of Southeast Asian
refugees.
   ``He seemed like a real nice young man,'' said Pat Thomas, 45,
who lives next door to Purdy's aunt in the Portland, Ore., suburb of
Sandy, where the young man lived from July through October last
year. ``He was here looking for work.''
   But while Purdy was in Sandy last August, he also purchased the
AK-47 assault rifle used in the rampage, police said.
   Sandy Police Chief Fred Punzel said Purdy's aunt, Julie Michael,
told him the gunman had a troubled upbringing, a prelude to what
Stockton police described as an ``extensive criminal history,''
including convictions for weapons, narcotics and soliciting for sex.
   ``She told me he was a loner and as a child he was an
alcoholic,'' Punzel said.
   Purdy visited his grandmother about twice a year, using her
address to pick up his mail, which included magazines on the welding
trade.
   She said his parents were married in Stockton, then divorced
after a short time. His mother remarried and took Purdy to the Lake
Tahoe, Nev., region and then to the Sacramento area.
   He dropped out of high school and began drifting about 10 years
ago, criss-crossing the nation looking for work, his grandmother
said. He visited her occasionally and used her address to receive
mail.
   Punzel said Mrs. Michael told him Purdy left Oregon for a job as
a boilermaker in Texas. That job fell through and he went to
Memphis, Tenn.
   The aunt and uncle last heard from Purdy at Thanksgiving, when he
was in Connecticut, Punzel said.
   he had a girlfriend for a time in Stockton, his grandmother said.
``But that was some time ago,'' she added.
   Early last year, he began attending vocational classes in welding
at San Joaquin Delta Community College in Stockton.
   ``It troubles me to think that such a terrible thing can
happen,'' Chumbley said. ``It's like a nightmare.''
   In a weary voice, she added, ``This is the sort of thing that
happens to others. Not to you. Your own grandson.''

   A weary and frustrated Mayor Xavier Suarez is
reaching out to blacks in an attempt to stem the violence and
tension that has fractured his city for two days.
   Suarez promised an intensive investigation into the fatal
shooting of an unarmed black motorcyclist by a white Hispanic police
officer Monday, which triggered the wave of gunfire, lootings and
arson in the city's Overtown and Liberty City districts.
   ``We will not rest until we come to the bottom of what happened
to spark this riot,'' said Suarez in a televised appeal for calm
Tuesday night. ``We must curb our anger with restraint. We must turn
our fear into strength, for our families and our city.''
   His appeal came after the apparent failure of a police strategy
to end the riots by avoiding major confrontations with angry blacks
in Overtown on Monday night.
   But despite a tranquil morning in Overtown, violence was renewed
Tuesday night and spread to Liberty City, where a young black man
was fatally shot and six other people were wounded.
   Minutes after Monday's fatal shooting, Suarez attempted to
intervene between police and an angry crowd.
   At one point, he walked up to a hostile crowd that had gathered
near the body of the dead motorcyclist and asked for calm. But his
efforts were met with a shower of rocks and bottles.
   City Manager Cesar Odio, watching with police down the street,
told an officer: ``Somebody go get him, he's crazy.'' But Suarez
stood his ground and promised the angry gathering: ``I promise you
to look into this. I will get to the bottom of this.''
   When the 39-year-old Suarez was re-elected to his second two-year
term, he claimed 62 percent of the vote and a majority among the
city's three major groups _ English-speaking whites, Hispanics and
blacks.
   He saw the vote as a sign of better relations between the three
groups.
   He points to his efforts to provide affordable housing projects
in Overtown, the building of the nearby Miami Arena and his frequent
visits to the Overtown community as signs of progress.
   The Cuban-born Suarez grew up in Washington, D.C., and moved to
Miami in 1975. He ran unsuccessfully for the City Commission and for
mayor before his election in 1985. He runs as an independent, but he
is a strong supporter of President-elect Bush.
   Suarez is an attorney with a law degree from Harvard. The married
father of four has been described in national publications as sign
that the Cuban immigrants are coming of age in America.
   But Bill Perry, former leader of the Greater Miami National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said a year ago
that the Cubans' gain could be perceived as the blacks' loss unless
Suarez does more to build unity.
   And on Tuesday, Suarez was defending his record in the black
community and looking for a way out of the nightmare sparked by the
police shooting.
   ``Overtown was neglected but now is the area in which the city
has been making its greatest effort with the largest urban renewal
project _ affordable housing _ possibly in the entire nation,'' he
said.

   A jury may convict Joel Steinberg of beating his
illegally adopted daughter to death even if they find he did not
strike the fatal blow, the trial judge said.
   State Supreme Court Justice Harold Rothwax said Tuesday if the
jurors find Steinberg was aware the child was injured and in danger,
and that she died as a result of action or inaction by him, then
they may convict him of murder.
   Steinberg, 47, a disbarred millionaire lawyer, is charged with
second-degree murder in the beating death of 6-year-old Lisa
Steinberg, the girl he illegally obtained at birth from an unwed
teen and raised as his own.
   The child was removed unconscious from his Greenwich Village
apartment on Nov. 2, 1987. She died of a brain injury three days
later at a nearby hospital.
   The prosecution charges Steinberg hit the girl, but even if he
killed her unintentionally, he acted ``recklessly'' and showed a
``depraved indifference'' to her life by allowing her to lie
unconscious for 12 hours without seeking help.
   The judge said he will submit for the jury's consideration the
four homicide counts available in this state. They are second-degree
murder, first-and second-degree manslaughter and criminally
negligent homicide.
   The judge denied defense motions to throw out the homicide
charges saying there was ``sufficient evidence'' to sustain them.
   Defense lawyer Adrian DiLuzio asked Rothwax to drop the charges
on the ground that the only evidence implicating Steinberg in the
child's death came from an accomplice, Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's
former live-in companion.
   ``I will charge that Hedda Nussbaum is an accomplice as a matter
of law'' in the death of Lisa, Rothwax said. This means the panel
may consider her testimony only if there is corroborating _
supporting _ evidence.
   ``It seems to me there is ample corroboration of the accomplice
testimony in this case,'' the judge said, ``and the motion to
dismiss those counts on that ground will be denied.''
   Rothwax granted a defense motion to drop the endangering the
welfare of a child charge with respect to Lisa. ``I'm disinclined to
submit that count to the jury,'' he said.
   He called the charge a ``distraction'' and said Steinberg has
already served more than the one-year maximum for that count anyway
since he has been held without bail since November 1987.
   The prosecution and defense have rested in the case and the
defense is expected to give closing arguments on Thursday. The
prosecution will sum up on Friday and Rothwax will give his final
instructions to the jurors on Monday just before they begin
deliberating.
   Rothwax cautioned Steinberg's lawyers against saying anything in
summation that sounds like an insanity defense.
   ``You can call it insanity or you can call it vanilla,'' Rothwax
said, warning that he will reopen the trial, now in its 12th week,
and allow the prosecution psychiatrist to testify about his
interviews last week with Steinberg if defense lawyers say anything
that smacks of an insanity defense.
   ``We have no intention of arguing insanity,'' DiLuzio said.
   The judge also said he will tell the jurors that he allowed them
to see and hear evidence that Ms. Nussbaum, 46, a former children's
book editor, was battered by Steinberg only so they could assess her
state of mind at the time of Lisa's death and evaluate her testimony
accordingly.

<TEXT>
   Lloyd M. Bentsen Sr., a rancher who
returned from World War I with $1.50 in his pocket and forged a
multimillion-dollar empire, was remembered as a pioneer and
entrepreneur following his death at age 95 in a car crash.
   ``He was part of this Valley. He loved this Valley,'' his son,
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen Jr., said upon arriving Tuesday night from
Washington.
   Bentsen was pronounced dead at the scene of Tuesday morning's
accident at a rural intersection of Hidalgo County in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley, said Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman
David Wells.
   Gov. William Clements called Bentsen ``a great Texas entrepreneur
who contributed much to the people of our state, particularly those
in South Texas.''
   Bentsen was ``an entrepreneur whose leadership and character have
long since made him a legend in Texas. Texas has lost a true pioneer
and a great citizen,'' added Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   Bentsen remained active with his farming, ranching and real
estate interests until his death and showed no physical evidence of
the two times in his long career he was trampled by stampeding
cattle.
   ``He was here two or three times a week, sometimes every day,''
said Bud Williams, foreman for the past 25 years at Bentsen's
16,000-acre La Coma Ranch in Hidalgo County, one of six ranches
Bentsen owned.
   Bentsen held nearly 50,000 acres of farms and ranches scattered
on a South Texas empire he began carving out of brush near the
Mexican border in 1920.
   He was on the stage during part of last summer's Democratic
National Convention, where his son was named the party's vice
presidential candidate.
   The senior Bentsen was one of six children of Danish parents who
settled before the turn of the century on a small South Dakota farm.
   He had little time as a child for school and none at all after
age 13, when he followed the grain harvest across Iowa, Nebraska and
the Dakotas.
   The incidental injuries in breaking wild horses were nothing
compared to a motorcycle accident in 1915 in which Bentsen broke
several bones and almost lost his life.
   After months of treatment, he fled the hospital and, following
several rejections, eventually tricked a drunken recruiting officer
into enlisting him in the Army.
   In 1920, Bentsen returned from the war and persuaded Edna Ruth
Colbath _ his ``Dolly'' _ to marry him. He had $1.50 in his pocket.
After the wedding, he borrowed $500 and began building his empire.
   Police said Tuesday the elder Bentsen apparently failed to yield
the right of way at a stop sign.
   Two people in the other car were injured. Ramiro Rosalez, 22, was
treated and released, and his sister Margarita, 19, who required
facial surgery, was in stable condition at Mission Hospital,
hospital officials said.
   In addition to the senator, Bentsen and his wife, who died in
1977, had three children: Kenneth, a Houston architect; Don, a
McAllen businessman; and Betty, wife of Lower Rio Grande Valley
businessman Dan Winn.
   Funeral services were scheduled Thursday at First Baptist Church
in McAllen.

<DATELINE>FIGUERAS, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surrealist painter Salvador Dali was in
stable condition today in the intensive care unit of a Spanish
hospital after suffering heart failure, doctors said.
   A six-doctor team at Figueras Hospital said the 84-year-old
artist was in no immediate health danger. In a medical statement
this morning, the doctors said, ``If there is no major change in his
condition, no further medical statements will be issued until
Friday.''
   Dali has suffered chronic heart ailments in recent years. He has
been hospitalized three times the last two months for severe heart
trouble and in 1986 underwent surgery to receive a pacemaker.
   Dali, a founding member of the surrealist movement, is the last
of an outstanding generation of Spanish painters that included Pablo
Picasso, who died in 1973, and Joan Miro, who died a decade later.
   The statement did not mention whether Dali suffered a lung clot,
although earlier a hospital spokesman had said such a clot had
aggravated the artist's condition.
   The team signing the statement included the artist's longtime
physician, Carles Punsati, and five other doctors.
   Hospital spokeswoman Maria Hernandez said by telephone that Dali
``was resting comfortably,'' but she did not elaborate.
   Doctors permitted Dali to return home Dec. 25 after a three-day
stay in the same hospital for treatment of an intestinal lesion.
   Before that, the painter spent 16 days in Barcelona's Quiron
Clinic in extremely critical condition due to severe heart trouble
aggravated by clots in his left lung. He was released Dec. 14.
   A native of Figuras, 60 miles north of Barcelona, Dali has been
in poor health and wheelchair-bound since August 1984, when he
suffered severe burns in a fire in the bedroom of Pubol Castle, his
residence at the time, in nearby La Pera.
   He was hospitalized for three months after the fire before moving
to Galatea Tower. He has since lived in seclusion, fed by
gastro-nasal tube and watched round-the-clock by a team of nurses.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with
former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the official Soviet
news agency Tass reported.
   Kissinger was in Moscow for a meeting of the Trilateral
Commission, along with former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of
France and former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan.
   The 15-year-old commission is a private group of business,
government, labor and academic leaders from North America, Europe
and Japan.
   Tass said without elaborating that Gorbachev and Kissinger on
Tuesday discussed ``some considerations on the development of
Soviet-American relations, which were set forth by Kissinger on
behalf of U.S. President-elect George Bush.''
   A senior official in Bush's transition office said in Washington
that Kissinger was not an emissary of the vice president but,
speaking on condition of anonymity, added: ``We expect him to pass
along greetings from the president-elect.''
   Kissinger, secretary of state under President Nixon, was a
foreign policy adviser to Bush during the presidential campaign.
   Kissinger and other participants in the Trilateral Commission
meeting were scheduled to meet with Gorbachev later today.

   _6:05 p.m, off-duty police Officer John Mervolion is sitting in a
marked patrol car when he spots two black men on a motorcycle
speeding northbound from downtown into the Overtown area.
   Mervolian, 34, turns on his blue lights and chases the
motorcycle, but the driver, Clement Anthony Lloyd, 23, doesn't stop,
said police spokesman Raymond Lang.
   Mervolian, a seven-year police veteran, calls for assistance on
his police radio. Three blocks away, Officer William Lozano is
filling out a crime report when he hears the call and realizes the
motorcycle was heading toward him.
   Lozano, 29, fires once, hitting Lloyd in the head, Lang said. The
bike veers across the center line and smashes into a car. Lloyd is
pronounced dead at the scene. His passenger, Allen Blanchard, 24, is
taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital in critical condition.
   _7:30 p.m., Mayor Xavier Suarez and City Manager Cesar Odio
arrive at the scene with more police and attempt to calm the rapidly
growing crowd.
   _8 p.m., police officers, reporters and city officials are
surrounded and retreat under a hail of rocks and bottles.
   _8:20 p.m., all off-duty officers and police supervisors are

<TEXT>
   A record number of community hospitals closed for
the sixth year in a row last year, the American Hospital Association
said, promising to fight any further cuts in federal Medicare and
Medicaid funding.
   Eighty-one hospitals in 28 states shut down in 1988, the
organization said Tuesday. The Southwest was hardest hit, with 18
closings in Texas alone.
   In addition, 21 non-community hospitals closed in 15 states, the
association said.
   Community hospitals are generally defined as those not serving a
specific group like a university, military base or prison. They can
be publicly or privately owned. Non-community hospitals typically
provide rehabilitative or long-term care.
   The closings were primarily due to inadequate Medicare and
Medicaid payments for treatment of the elderly and poor, said
association President Carol McCarthy.
   ``Hospitals cannot lose money or barely break even year after
year and remain open,'' Ms. McCarthy said. ``It's just that simple.''
   She said the association would ``pull out all the stops'' to stop
cuts in Medicare and improve health care funding for America's
indigent.
   Since 1980, 445 community hospitals have closed, and the number
has increased steadily since 1982, the association said.
   Forty-three of the 81 community hospitals that closed in 1988
were rural.
   ``For the last several years, seven out of 10 rural hospitals and
50 percent of urban hospitals have lost money caring for patients,''
Ms. McCarthy said.
   For most hospitals, profit margins are disappearing, and they
cannot cut costs to stay open, said association vice president
Alexander Williams.
   ``The problem is not excess expenses,'' Williams said. ``The ones
that close have gone through draconian cost cutting measures. The
problem is one of revenue.''

<HEAD>Firm That Allegedly Helped Libyans Refit Warplanes Under Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said today that they have
begun a criminal investigation of a Bavarian firm that a news
magazine says helped Libya develop the ability for in-flight
refueling of warplanes.
   Munich Prosecutor Heinz Stocker said the Intec Technical Trade
and Logistic company was suspected of violating West Germany's
export laws.
   He said the probe was focusing on whether ``(fuel) tank equipment
sent to Libya required an export permit.''
   ``We don't know what was done with this equipment in Libya. That
is something that must be examined,'' Stocker told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview. He did not elaborate on the
equipment sent to Libya and said he could not give out other details.
   It was not immediately clear whether investigators were also
looking into a report by Der Spiegel magazine that Intec engineers
had helped refit Libyan warplanes so they can be refueled in
mid-flight.
   Prosecutors also did not say whether the investigation was at all
related to the involvement by West German companies in the
construction and outfitting of a suspected chemical weapons plant in
Libya.
   Der Spiegel reported this week that 10 Intec-hired engineers were
playing a key role in helping Libya fit warplanes and transport
planes with equipment necessary for in-flight refueling.
   ``In addition to the construction of its own chemical weapons
plant, Libya is re-equipping its air force with the goal of
increasing the operations radius of its bombers to as far away as
Jerusalem,'' it said.
   ``For over two years, the German technicians have been involved
in turning Hercules transport planes into flying gas stations'' for
Libya, Spiegel said.
   It alleged that Intec-hired engineers are also equipping Libyan
warplanes with the special devices needed for mid-air refueling.
   The Hamburg-based magazine said the work has been going on at a
``tightly guarded air base'' near Tripoli.
   Spiegel quoted an official with the Bavarian firm as denying the
company was guilty of any wrongdoing. Intec ``has nothing to do with
construction work on airplanes in Libya,'' the magazine quoted Ingo
Moehring as saying.
   Moehring is the son of Eberhard Moehring, identifed by Spiegel as
owner of the Bavarian firm. Ingo Moehring said the company last year
had only delivered ``metal, rivets and nuts'' to Libya, Spiegel
reported.
   Intec is based in Vatterstetten, which is located near Munich.

   Seven U.S. airlines that fly Boeing 737s
similar to the British Midland Airways airliner that crashed Jan. 8
in England say they found no wiring problems during inspections
ordered by the Federal Aviation Administration.
   But one airline conducting an unrelated inspection found other
wiring foulups in two larger Boeing 757 aircraft. FAA officials in
Seattle said they were concerned about an apparent delay in
reporting the problem in another case.
   Officials of America West, Continental, Delta, Piedmont,
Southwest, United and U.S. Air said Tuesday that all their 737-300s
had been checked and no cross-wiring or other problem was found in
engine warning systems.
   The 737 inspections resulted from speculation that crosed-wiring
might have misled the pilot of the British Midland jet to shut down
his good right engine after the left one caught fire. Officials have
yet to determine the cause of the crash, which killed 44 people, but
they say they found no evidence of a problem with the right engine
except that it had been shut down.
   American and Aloha airlines officials did not immediately respond
to inquiries about the testing, but FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn said
it appeared there were no problems with any of the airlines covered
by the ``airworthiness directive.'' He said, however, the FAA had
not yet compiled all the reports from airlines.
   Delta Air Lines, responding to another FAA order covering fire
sprinkler systems in Boeing 757 cargo holds, said Tuesday it found
faulty wiring in two of its aircraft. That brings to seven the total
number of 757s found with such problems worldwide.
   One case of faulty wiring in a 757 was reported to Boeing in
August by Royal Brunei Airlines, but Boeing relayed the information
to the FAA only this month, Mitch Barker of the agency's Seattle
office told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
   ``Boeing is under an obligation to look into these types of
things and report them to the FAA,'' Barker said Tuesday. ``There's
some leeway in the process, but if there is a long delay that would
be a concern to us.''
   The reporting delay was a ``blip,'' said David Jiminez of Boeing.
``It was a breakdown in communication. Generally (both manufacturer
and carrier) report to the FAA, but in this case it just didn't
happen.''
   FAA orders cover only domestic airliners, but foreign carriers
using U.S. built aircraft generally comply with any safety
inspections ordered.
   ``We're looking to see what happened in the system to allow this
(faulty wiring) to happen, where it happened, how it happened, and
to see how we can make it not happen again,'' said Boeing spokesman
Tom Cole in Seattle.
   Cole said officials would not take any steps affecting production
of new 757s until they received the results of the inspections from
the FAA.
   The FAA orders covering 737s and 757s were not related, except
that they both involved cross-wiring.
   The cargo-hold problems have been reported in another
Delta-operated 757, one belonging to Royal Brunei Airlines, two
owned by Air Holland, and one operated by the British airline Air
2000. One of the Air Holland planes was being used by a charter
company in Canada.
   Officials of Eastern, which operates 25 of the 757s; Northwest,
which has 33; and America West, which has seven, said Tuesday that
they found no problems with any of their planes. No other U.S.
airline operates the 757.
   Jim Lundy, a Delta spokesman in Atlanta, said the carrier
immediately notified the FAA of the latest two cases and corrected
the problems which would have prevented sprinklers from working
properly in the event of a fire in a baggage hold.
   One airplane had a crossed-wiring problem that would have turned
on the wrong sprinklers if a fire had broken out, Lundy said. The
other had faulty wiring that would have warned the pilot of a fire
but would not have activated the sprinklers, he said.
   He said it was a similar crossed-wiring problem found on a Delta
plane before delivery from the Boeing factory that prompted the FAA
757 airworthiness directive last week.
   Airlines had until Tuesday morning to complete the inspections
and regular airline service was not affected, officials said.

   Hundreds of people rushed to hospitals
in southern Sri Lanka today, hoping to find that loved ones had
survived a train-bus collision in which at least 45 people were
killed, officials said.
   Most of the dead were schoolchildren.
   Police and witnesses to Tuesday's crash said the bus driver
apparently thought he could beat the express train, but his
vehicle's engine stalled on the unguarded crossing about 43 miles
south of Colombo.
   At a Cabinet meeting today, President Ranasinghe Premadasa
ordered all the country's 758 railway crossings to have gates
installed by Monday, said spokesman Festus Perera.
   Seventy-one of the 120 mostly young people on the bus were
injured, and six critically injured victims were taken to Colombo
today for emergency surgery, police said. No one on the train was
injured.
   The train, traveling at about 40 mph, knocked the bus about 150
feet down the track, witnesses said, and many bus passengers were
hurled into a field. Others, most of them aged 5 to 15, were trapped
inside the mangled vehicle.
   ``Bodies were all over ... Children were screaming,'' said a
Buddhist priest who helped carry the injured to ambulances.
   Many of the victims could not easily be identified, and nurses
asked relatives to check clothing for identification. At the crash
site, police searched through bloodstained school books, pencils and
shoes for clues to the victims' identities.
   ``We are working with badly mutilated bodies, some of them only
limbs,'' said one police officer.
   Relatives crowded into the two government-run hospitals where the
dead and injured were taken.
   One wailing mother walked through the hospital halls calling out,
``Inoka, Inoka.'' Nurses ran after her and stopped her from entering
the morgue.
   Hema Premadasa, the president's wife, visited the accident site
and hospitals this morning, going from bed to bed trying to comfort
the injured and console relatives of the dead.
   The bus had picked up children from four schools in Amblangoda
and was headed toward Urgasmanhandiya, about 10 miles away, when the
crash occurred.
   One witness said she tried to flag the bus down because she
thought the driver probably could not see the train because of a
light drizzle. But other witnesses and police said they thought the
driver saw the train and still tried to make it across the track,
especially since five children riding on the steps of the bus jumped
out and escaped injury.
   The bus driver suffered minor injuries, they said.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Jaromir Johanes of
Czechoslovakia today dismissed harsh Western criticism of a police
crackdown on dissidents in Prague and said the demonstrators had
broken the law by assembling.
   ``Anyone in this hall who wants to point the finger at other
nations, including Czechoslovakia, should first of all look at
himself,'' Johanes said.
   ``Acts in breach of legal and public order cannot be tolerated by
any government,'' he said, departing from his prepared text. ``Laws
have to be observed by all.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, meanwhile, said upon
arriving in Vienna that the Berlin Wall is not a subject for
negotiations at the conference in Vienna on human rights and
East-West relations.
   Shevardnadze, scheduled to address the final session of the
35-nation conference on Thursday, also told reporters there are
``many areas in which (East and West) just disagree'' on human
rights issues.
   Johanes spoke a day after police armed with truncheons broke up
crowds of protesters in Prague's Wenceslas Square for a third day,
chasing hundreds of youths with water cannons.
   On Sunday, police used tear gas, batons, dogs and water cannons
to break up 5,000 demonstrators gathered to remember Jan Palach, a
Czech student who killed himself in 1969 to protest the 1968
Soviet-led invasion of his homeland.
   On Monday, 14 prominent dissidents including banned playwright
Vaclav Havel were detained after they tried to lay flowers in
Palach's memory.
   Havel, Charter 77 spokespersons Dana Nemcova and Sasha Vondra and
the other 11 activists remained in detention today.
   In an interview with Austrian radio after his speech, Johanes
said: ``What is happening in Prague is not a violation of human
rights.''
   Asked what he meant by his comment that other countries should
look at their own rights records, Johanes cited as an example the
wave of arrests in Miami in the past two days following rioting by
blacks there.
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz and British Foreign
Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe strongly criticized the Czechoslovak
police action Tuesday, the first day of a three-day meeting of the
foreign ministers from the 35 nations to wrap up new accords on
human rights and security.
   Shultz said Czechoslovakia violated the new accords just one hour
after they were formally adopted Sunday by delegates who worked 27
months to draft them. Shultz, however, praised the Soviet Union,
Hungary and Poland for recent economic and political reforms.
   Polish Foreign Minister Tadeusz Olechowski, speaking after his
country's communist leaders set conditions for legalizing
Solidarity, pledged his country would fully adhere to the accords
reached in Vienna.
   ``I can assure you that Poland will scrupulously implement all
the obligations which she has assumed,'' Olechowski said.
   ``We shall review the existing legislation to see whether it is
consistent with these new recommendations and, where it is not, to
introduce the necessary amendments. We shall expect similar moves by
other states,'' he added.
   Johanes made no such pledge to review Czechoslovak laws, thus
emphasizing the gap that opened up at the Vienna conference between
reformist nations in the Soviet bloc and those more reluctant to
change.
   The accords call for new arms control talks between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact to reduce conventional arms across Europe. Those
negotiations are due to open in Vienna March 9.
   Johanes said the new talks ``will become an important practical
test of the political resolve to reach tangible progress'' toward
disarmament.
   Shevardnadze was asked by reporters if the recently concluded
agreement at the conference indicated the Berlin Wall could now be
dismantled.
   ``I don't think that the Berlin Wall is a subject for the Vienna
meeting,'' he said. ``Each state has the right to build its
frontiers as it wishes and we must proceeed from there.''

<HEAD>Developer Abandons $120 Million Waterfront Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A developer is abandoning his $120 million
Penn's Landing mall and office project along the Delaware River
about three months before its scheduled groundbreaking, calling it
``an expensive mistake.''
   Willard Rouse III, admitting ``deep regret and certainly
embarrassment,'' said Tuesday he had received construction and
marketing reports in the past three weeks showing rents in the first
stage of development wouldn't balance costs.
   The major problems were a nationwide slump in retailing and a
glut of office space in Philadelphia, he said.
   City officials were shocked by the announcement after three years
of negotiations and lengthy City Council hearings on the project on
the waterfront where William Penn and other English settlers landed
more than 350 years ago.
   ``We are very disappointed and surprised,'' said City Commerce
Director William P. Hankowsky. ``Things had been moving along very
well.''
   Plans called for a hotel and a parking garage in addition to
offices and stores. More buildings were contemplated in the next
decade for an additional $400 million investment.
   The city had pledged to provide up to $19.5 million in subsidies
for the project and to pay $2 million a year for maintenance as part
of a lease agreement on the city-owned tract. Rouse was to pay rent
of $100,000 a year plus a percentage of profits.
   Rouse had not signed the lease agreement, but had been expected
to do so by the end of this month, Hankowsky said.
   The developer said it was more prudent to quit now, even though
he already has spent $5 million on the project.
   ``It was an expensive mistake,'' he told a news conference at his
Rouse and Associates' 21st-floor headquarters at One Liberty Place,
the city's tallest building which he completed last year. ``It was a
terribly challenging project we wanted to do, and it will take a
while to get over it.''
   Groundbreaking was to begin before May 1.
   Asked the consequences for Philadelphia, Rouse replied, ``It
leaves the city with a great piece of dirt.''
   Hankowsky said city officials would re-evaluate the Penn's
Landing plan, and might negotiate with Rouse to build part of the
project or seek proposals from other developers.

   The FBI is investigating the conduct of a
white police officer who was secretly filmed as he rammed a black
man's head through a plate glass window.
   The Long Beach City Council on Tuesday also asked the Los Angeles
district attorney to investigate Saturday's incident, in which
NBC-TV filmed officer Mark Dickey shoving Don Jackson's head into
the store-front window.
   Jackson is a police sergeant in suburban Hawthorne on a leave
pending the outcome of his race-related stress disability lawsuit
against that city.
   Jackson said he and off-duty state corrections officer Jeffrey
Hill set up the self-styled ``sting'' with NBC-TV as part of an
investigation into racism.
   ``We are involved. We have opened a ticket on it into possible
civil rights violations,'' said FBI spokesman Fred Reagan.
   The tape showed Jackson getting out of a car after being stopped
by Long Beach officers. After a verbal exchange, an officer
searching for weapons then shoved Jackson's head through the window.
   ``We will not tolerate any type of racism or brutality,'' said
Mayor Ernie Kell. ``We need to find out what actually happened here
and, if we were at fault, make sure it never happens again. We must
get to the bottom of this.''
   Jackson's attorney, Tom Beck, said ``a lawsuit is inevitable.''
   Kell said ``it is critical'' that the city get NBC's complete
unedited tape, but NBC attorneys said only those segments that were
broadcast would be turned over. The mayor said the city would fight
to get the tapes.
   Mike Tracy, a Long Beach Police Officers Association board
member, agreed that the entire tape was needed.
   ``We're incensed. All we are seeing is what NBC wants us to
see,'' Tracy complained. ``We want to see a reverse angle. It could
have been the officer's body part that went through that window.''
   Dickey has asked to work in the police department's detective
bureau until the case is resolved, Tracy said.

<HEAD>Jackson Says He's Concerned About D.C. Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights leader Jesse L. Jackson says he is
seeking to provide counseling to District of Columbia Mayor Marion
Barry Jr., who has been beset by questions over his personal and
professional conduct.
   Jackson said his concern over Barry is personal. He declined to
defend or criticize Barry, who is involved in controversies
surrounding his visit to the hotel room of a former city employee
who police said was the subject of a drug investigation.
   ``I'm in no position to make a political evaluation of the
current situation,'' Jackson was quoted in today's editions of The
Washington Post. ``My first consideration is his health and
well-being.''
   Jackson said he planned to visit with Barry during his stay here
for the inauguration of President-elect Bush.
   ``I know the burden of being under attack. I have been there,''
Jackson said. ``People are hurt and their families are hurt.''
   A poll commissioned by Washington station WUSA-TV found that
Jackson would be the overwhelming choice of both black and white
voters if he were to run for mayor in 1990. But Jackson, who has
homes in Chicago and Washington, said he has no such plans.
   The poll also found that while 58 percent of the city's residents
opposed a recall election, 44 percent would vote to oust Barry if
the referendum were held. The survey of 506 registered voters Jan.
12-14 had an error rate of four percentage points.
   Barry said Tuesday that he took a urine test earlier in the day
as part of his annual physical. He has repeatedly denied ever using
illegal drugs and said he never knowingly associated with drug
dealers.
   The results of Tuesday's test were not immediately available.
   The mayor said earlier this month that he has submitted to drug
tests as part of his annual checkup, has been found drug-free and
that the results have been made public. Barry's press secretary and
reporters could not recall any such new news release, however.
   The Post reported, meanwhile, that a woman who pleaded guilty to
four counts of selling cocaine accompanied Jules Lloyd, the legal
counsel to the city personnel office, on a trip to the Virgin
Islands last October as part of a joint personnel project between
the D.C. and Virgin Islands governments.
   April Herrell, a former nightclub dancer now living in a halfway
house, confirmed she took the trip while awaiting sentencing.
   Ms. Herrell, 25, and Lloyd stayed at a luxurious St. Thomas
hotel, where the bill was paid by the Virgin Islands government,
which since has objected to the spending by Lloyd and others on the
project.
   The former project director, Charles Lewis, is the man Barry met
several times in the Washington hotel room just before Christmas.
   The Barry-Lewis meetings and the personnel deal are the subjects
of several federal, D.C., and Virgin Islands investigations.

<HEAD>Casino Head Admits Bribery In Latest Corruption Scandal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent businessman has
admitted paying a $1 million bribe to a black homeland leader, the
latest in a series of corruption scandals involving leading
politicians and executives.
   In a letter presented Tuesday to a judicial inquiry commission in
Pretoria, hotel and casino magnate Sol Kerzner acknowledged the 1986
payment to George Matanzima, who at the time was leader of Transkei.
The homeland's army overthrew Matanzima in December 1987, accusing
him of corruption.
   Kerzner is deputy chairman of Sun International, which has built
luxury hotels and casinos throughout the region, including the
internationally known Sun City resort in Bophuthatswana.
   Kerzner said the payment was made to preserve Sun International's
monopoly on gambling licenses in Transkei. He accused Matanzima of
placing ``undue pressure'' on Sun International by threatening to
grant another company the right to open a casino in the impoverished
homeland.
   Kerzner said he acted jointly with David Bloomberg, a business
associate who was once the mayor of Cape Town. The men issued a
joint statement to the inquiry commission acknowledging the bribe.
   Attorney Fanie Cilliers, who is representing Kerzner and
Bloomberg, said there is no law in South Africa against bribing an
official from a foreign government. Transkei and Bophuthatswana are
designated independent by South Africa, although they are not
recognized abroad.
   Prosecutors and investigative commissions have uncovered several
other scandals in recent weeks.
   Among them:
   _An investigative committee this week asked the state to
prosecute Parliament member Peet de Pontes for alleged fraud and
perjury in connection with smuggling an Italian drug financier into
the country.
   Vito Palazzolo, the bankroller for the $1.6 billion ``Pizza
Connection'' international drug network, arrived in South Africa in
December 1986 on a false passport after fleeing Switzerland while on
a prison furlough.
   De Pontes, who was a rising star in President P.W. Botha's
National Party, claims he had no knowledge of Palazzolo's criminal
record when he offered him assistance to settle in South Africa. He
has refused to quit Parliament.
   Botha has sued an Afrikaans-language newspaper, Free Weekly, for
libel over a story that said he and Foreign Minister Pik Botha had
dinner with Palazzolo. The newspaper said its story was based on a
sworn statement given to police.
   _Businessman Albert Vermaas, a friend of Pik Botha and other
senior government officials, is under investigation for possible
irregularities involving multimillion-dollar foreign exchange deals.
   There are strict limits on the amount of money that can be taken
out of South Africa, and Vermaas allegedly was allowed to make huge
transactions without having to receive approval from the Reserve
Bank.
   _Leon de Beer, elected to Parliament in 1987 in a closely
contested race, was convicted last year of vote fraud. De Beer has
resigned from the National Party but has maintained his seat in
Parliament while he appeals.
   _P.W. Botha in December fired Amichand Rajbansi, the only Cabinet
member of Indian descent, following investigations by two
parliamentary committees and an inquiry commission. Rajbansi was
accused of abusing his post in granting various contracts and
licenses.
   Business Day, the country's leading financial daily, said in an
editorial today that Botha ``has presided over the sleaziest
administration South Africa has known'' this century.

<HEAD>Bush Meets with Teamsters Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush has met with Teamsters
union leaders, including six scheduled for trial on racketeering
charges, to thank them for their support in the election.
   The meeting was held Tuesday without announcement in the office
of John Sununu, chief of staff to the incoming president, according
to Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman for Bush.
   Confirming an account of the meeting in today's editions of The
Washington Post, Ms. Tate said: ``The Teamsters people were meeting
with Sununu and the president-elect simply stopped by briefly. The
purpose was to thank them for their support during the election
campaign.''
   The Teamsters have supported the Republicans in the last three
presidential elections, and Bush appeared at the union's board
meetings in the inaugural weeks in 1981 and in 1985 to express
thanks for the endorsements of the Reagan-Bush ticket.
   Many members reportedly opposed the 1988 endorsement because of
the Justice Department's success in winning the racketeering
indictment. The department is seeking a federal trusteeship for the
union in the trial scheduled to begin Feb. 27 in New York.
   The union's president, William McCarthy of Boston, was strongly
opposed to the Democratic candidate, Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts.
   Defendants in the case are McCarthy and 17 other members of the
union's executive board.
   According to an unidentified aide quoted in the Post account,
Bush ``just stuck his head in the door'' in lieu of another public
appearance at a board meeting, during a session of Sununu and the
Teamsters leaders that lasted less than 20 minutes.
   Sununu told the gathering that any discussion of the racketeering
case or any other case ``would be inappropriate.''

<TEXT>
   Attorneys want a federal judge to issue a
gag order in the fraud trial of former PTL leader Jim Bakker, who
pleaded innocent to charges of diverting money donated by his
television audience.
   Bakker's lawyer, George T. Davis, asked for the order at the TV
evangelist's arraignment Tuesday in U.S. District Court.
   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor told Davis and a Justice Department
prosecutor to draft a proposed consent order after Davis cited
concerns over the comments of a retired federal bankruptcy judge who
supervised the sale of PTL assets.
   Davis noted that the bankruptcy judge, Rufus Reynolds, had called
the founder of the religious broadcasting empire a ``sawed-off
little runt'' and ``a thief.''
   ``We can't see how we can have a fair trial if we're innundated
with pretrial negative publicity, especially from a federal judge,''
Davis said. ``How can we prevent this? This guy is a loose cannon.
He's already gone overboard.''
   Bakker pleaded innocent at the hearing to 24 counts of mail and
wire fraud and conspiracy. He and Richard Dortch, 57, his former top
deputy at PTL, are accused of conspiring to defraud PTL contributors
and divert more than $4 million in PTL money for their personal use.
Dortch pleaded innocent last week.
   ``I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment,''
Bakker said after his arraignment. ``The judge asked for no
conversations about this case, but I'd like to say that Tammy and I
are thrilled to be back on TV.''
   The Bakkers began broadcasting ``The Jim and Tammy Show'' from
their leased home near Charlotte earlier this month. Bakker didn't
appear on the telecast Tuesday and his wife, Tammy Faye, handled the
program alone.

Malaysia hold the meetings from time to time to review their fight

<HEAD>Rival Lebanese Governments Agree To Arab League Talks On Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of rival Christian and Moslem
cabinets have agreed to cooperate with the Arab League in a bid to
prevent the formal partition of Lebanon, officials reported today.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, head of the Moslem cabinet,
said he will leave for Tunis later this month for talks with a
special committee of the 22-member league on ways of resolving a
4-month-old political crisis that threatens to cement Lebanon's
partition into sectarian cantons.
   ``We are prepared to cooperate with the Arab League committee,''
Hoss told The Associated Press. He said he will meet the committee
in Tunis on Jan. 28.
   The panel, headed by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, was formed Thursday in Tunis at a meeting of Arab
foreign ministers. It also includes the foreign ministers of Sudan,
Tunisia, Algeria, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates and the
league's secretary-general, Chedli Klibi.
   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, will also
meet the committee in Tunis later this month, his office announced.
   A political source in Christian east Beirut said army commander
Gen. Michel Aoun, who heads the Christian cabinet, also ``welcomed
the Arab League's interest in the Lebanese situation and expressed
readiness to cooperate with the committee.''
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Aoun ``would
decide on the level of his representation at a meeting with the
committee after he formally receives an invitation, which is
expected later this week.''
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, and Husseini were invited by Kuwaiti envoys
to meet the committee when the Lebanese officials visited the Syrian
capital of Damascus on Tuesday.
   The Kuwaiti diplomats, Abdel Mohsen al-Gaian and Ahmed ben
al-Jassem, were expected to visit east Beirut later this week to
deliver Sabah's invitation to Aoun, the independent An-Nahar daily
said.
   While they were in Damascus, Hoss and Husseini met Syria's vice
president, Abdul-Halim Khaddam, and discussed efforts by the
committee to resolve the Lebanese crisis and facilitate the election
of a new president to succeed Amin Gemayel, whose term expired Sept.
22.
   Parliamentary efforts to elect a successor failed when Christian
deputies opposed to Syrian-backed candidates boycotted the electoral
sessions.
   Minutes before he stepped down, Gemayel appointed Aoun head of an
interim military cabinet to rule Lebanon until a new president was
elected. Moslem leaders backed by Syria rejected Aoun's appoinment
and support Hoss' cabinet, the remnant of the long-fractured
government which served under Gemayel.
   An-Nahar said Khaddam told Hoss and Husseini that Syria supports
the Arab League's moves to find ``ways to end the Lebanese crisis.''
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, maintains about 40,000
troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as Moslem sectors
of Beirut.

   Security for George Bush's inauguration as the
nation's 41st president will be tight, with all law enforcement
officers throughout the area on duty following cancellation of all
days off.
   The 150,000 invited guests at the Capitol swearing-in ceremonies
will be screened by metal detectors, even if they'll be sitting
hundreds of yards away at the edge of the Capitol lawn.
   This is the first time those guests on the lawn will be screened
so carefully, and Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the Joint
Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, says he's upset
about the tightened regimen.
   ``Security is something that bothers me considerably,'' he said
at a news conference Tuesday. ``We're a free and open nation
insisting that those in the inner circle go through megadetectors.''
   Anyone going to any of the galas or anywhere else that the first
families might be will also be checked with the magnetometers.
   Demonstrations by those who want to see changes in the
administration's policies are planned throughout the ceremonies.
   A corner of Lafayette Park across from the White House has been
set aside ``to ensure First Amendment rights,'' in the words of Park
Police Capt. Michael Barrett. But other protests will be held across
the city.
   The Counter-Inaugural Coalition for a People's Agenda has
scheduled everything from a Union Station ``banquet'' _ a soup
kitchen _ to a ``No Honeymoon'' benefit concert for the Christic
Institute featuring David Crosby and Graham Nash at the Warner
Theater. The National Organization for Women plans to protest
silently all along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route.
   The manholes along Pennsylvania Avenue already have been welded
shut, but many other details of the security measures remain secret.
   ``We certainly wouldn't want to give anyone who had harmful
intent any kind of advantage,'' said Secret Service spokesman Ken
Lynch.
   Reports on previous inaugurations have indicated that agents
carrying shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to protect against air
attack were on the Capitol roof. Will that be the case this year? No
comment, say all the agencies involved.
   Bob Buckhorn, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman, noted
only that flying over the White House or the Capitol is a violation
of federal air regulations.
   In past inaugurals, bullet-proof panels have protected the new
president as he takes the oath of office and delivers his inaugural
address. Workers at the Capitol's West Front were installing a
bulletproof shield around the podium this week.
   Everybody willing to talk about it says Bush will ride in an
armored limousine as he travels from the Capitol to the White House
following the oath-taking. But then, that's what they said about
President Jimmy Carter before he and his wife, Rosalynn, climbed out
of their car and marched the 1{ miles down Pennsylvania Avenue in
January 1977.
   Jody Powell, Carter's press secretary, says Carter told him about
his plans the week before the inauguration, but the news was ``very
tightly held, for security purposes.''
   ``What he told me at the time was the deal was the Secret Service
wasn't going to fight it as long as it was kept secret, but if word
got out ahead of time, they'd be very opposed to it,'' Powell said.
   Secret Service spokesman Rich Adams says his agency will be
prepared to protect Bush if he decides to stroll down Pennsylvania
Avenue, but he admitted the service would not be too happy about it.
   ``If we had our way, he would not leave the White House,'' he
said.
   Law enforcement agencies involved in security for the inaugural
ceremonies include the Secret Service, Capitol Police, the local
police department, Metro transit police, Park Police, Federal
Protective Service and the District of Columbia National Guard. In
addition, private security guards have been arranged for various
parties.
   Approximately 8,500 military personnel will be involved in
inaugural duties, including bands and other units marching in the
parade, a cordon lining the parade route, and drivers for the first
families and governors.
   The Capitol will be closed to all unauthorized people starting at
5 p.m. Thursday, the day before the ceremony, Nichols said.
   On Inauguration Day, all streets within a two-block radius of the
Capitol will be closed. Even members of Congress and their staffs
won't be allowed to park on the lot on the building's east side.
   Security was in place a week in advance on the west side of the
Capitol where risers have been built for several hundred VIPs who
will sit behind Bush as he faces the mall to deliver his speech,
Nichols said.

<HEAD>Maryland Company To Supply In-Flight Meals for Aeroflot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frequent fliers might liken it to a
resumption of the cold war, but a U.S. company has signed a contract
to provide hot American airline food to passengers on the Soviet
Union's airline, Aeroflot.
   Officials of Aeroflot and the Marriott Corp., the world's largest
supplier of in-flight meals, announced Tuesday that they had formed
a joint venture to provide food service for Aeroflot, the world's
largest airline.
   The contract creates a new company, Aeromar Ltd., which is 51
percent owned by the Soviet Union and 49 percent owned by the
Marriott. The two said they will share profits and both will invest
capital, equipment and technical expertise.
   J.W. Marriott Jr., chairman and president of the Bethesda-based
hotel and restaurant company, said Marriott already caters Aeroflot
flights in New York, Washington, Paris, London and Manchester,
England.
   But the new agreement, covering both international and domestic
Aeroflot flights, will be the first contract food service operation
in the Soviet Union involving a Western company, he said.
   At a news conference at the Soviet Embassy in Washington,
Aeroflot director general Vladimir A. Nacharov said Aeroflot does
not presently serve meals on all its flights.
   Under terms of the agreement, formally signed in Moscow last
month, Marriott will participate in the renovation and modernization
of the flight kitchen at Moscow's Sheremetjevo Airport, the largest
airport in the Soviet Union.
   The project will cost about $5 million, Marriott said. He said
the company expects annual revenues of $15 million to $20 million
once the facility is fully operational.
   Airline food may not be the only thing Marriott is selling to the
Soviet Union. Marriott said the company will send a representative
to Moscow next week to evaluate the feasibility of a Moscow hotel.

<HEAD>Solidarity Complains About Conditions On Legalization Offer</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 11 grafs to ADD confidence vote, Walesa to speak
Thursday. Pickup 10th graf pvs, ``The authorities...''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Communist leaders passed a resolution early
today that could restore Solidarity's legal status, but officials of
the banned trade union movement said too many unacceptable
conditions appeared to be attached.
   Among conditions set before today's vote by the party's governing
Central Committee was that Solidarity declare itself in favor of
socialism, promise no strikes for two years and forfeit financial
assistance from the West.
   There was no immediate comment from Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa. An aide said he would hold a news conference Thursday.
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski said during debate Tuesday
he favored ending the seven-year ban on Solidarity if its leaders
promised not to drag the economically depressed country ``into
anarchy.''
   The official PAP news agency said today a majority of the
230-member Central Committee had approved the party leadership's
stand on trade union and political pluralism. Other details of the
proposal, debated 17 hours until 3 a.m., were not immediately
available.
   The vote occurred too late to be included in morning newspapers
and the text was not immediately carried by PAP.
   The Central Committee also gave an overwhelming vote of
confidence to top party authorities led by First Secretary Wojciech
Jaruzelski. PAP reported unanimous approval with four abstentions.
   A Solidarity source in Warsaw said Rakowski's proposal to
reinstate the only independent labor movement ever allowed in the
Soviet bloc appeared at first glance unclear, ``unacceptable'' or
even ``laughable.''
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Solidarity
could not function as a free trade union if forced to embrace an
ideology and stripped of the right to strike.
   Rakowski said the government needed assurances that a legally
functioning Solidarity would differ from the movement that used
general strike threats as a pressure tactic during its 16-month
heyday, which began in 1980. The organization was outlawed in 1982.
   Solidarity activists on Tuesday welcomed the shift in the party's
stance but said they must proceed with caution, because authorities
had acted out of necessity rather than good will.
   ``The authorities will do whatever that have to do to stay on
top. Let's wait and see what they have to say and read the fine
print carefully,'' said Maciej Jankowski, a Solidarity leader at
Warsaw University.
   Jaruzelski crushed Solidarity in a December 1981 military
crackdown, interning thousands of activists and banning the movement
the next year.
   After a series of spring and summer strikes demanding higher pay
and Solidarity's reinstatement, Jaruzelski agreed to resume contacts
with the movement. However, promised negotiations with the
opposition were repeatedly delayed over conditions set by both sides.
   Walesa has warned that the public mood is reaching the boiling
point because of rising prices and annoying consumer shortages.
   In the latest sign of tension, a strike for higher pay and
legalization of Solidarity on Tuesday shut down the 1,100-worker
Pabianice Fabric Works in the textile city of Lodz.
   Under the proposal Rakowski put to the Central Committee, final
legalization of Solidarity would follow a two-year probationary
period lasting until May 3, 1991, the 200th anniversary of the
adoption of a progressive constitution that Imperial Russia quickly
invalidated by force.
   ``We have to gain certainty that this Solidarity, which cannot be
a simple repetition of the old one, does not pull the country into
anarchy,'' Rakowski said.
   Rakowski addressed specific questions to Solidarity in his
speech, saying the answers would determine if the union could be a
partner, or whether it would remain a ``political opponent.''
   He asked what position Solidarity would take toward
anti-communist Polish groups like the Confederation for an
Independent Poland, and whether it would continue to take money from
the U.S. Congress and other foreign organizations.
   The U.S. government has granted Solidarity $1 million a year the
last two years, but Polish authorities have held up spending of half
of this. Total U.S. aid to Solidarity was estimated last year at $5
million by The New York Times.
   Solidarity does not deny receiving foreign help. Walesa said he
would take money from the Kremlin if he could use it to defend trade
union freedoms.
   Rakowski stressed that the economy would be the most important
factor for Poland during the next few years.
   ``It above all needs order and peace,'' he said. ``Even the best
administration methods and solutions will not meet our hopes if the
... economy becomes a field of political struggles.''

<HEAD>Clumsy Robber Drops Loot, Passersby Return It To Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FONTANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As might have been expected, when a
bumbling bank robber dropped his loot on the street a crowd quickly
gathered to grab what was blowing in the wind.
   What might not have been expected was that the bystanders
returned almost all the money to the bank.
   ``I think it's wonderful when citizens are willing to step in and
help,'' police Sgt. Dan Castellini said of Tuesday's incident. ``I'm
not sure there's anything pleasant about a robbery ... but when you
see something positive happen, you can't help but have a smile on
your face.''
   All but $20 of the $2,900 taken from Redlands Federal Savings was
returned, Castellini said. He said the missing $20 bill probably
blew away before anyone could grab it.
   Police said the incident began at 9:48 a.m. when a man walked
into the bank and handed a teller a bag and a note demanding money.
   After receiving the filled bag, the man fled, but dropped the bag
almost as soon as he got outside. Rather than stop to retrieve it,
he kept on running, leaving the money to scatter in the wind.
   The robber escaped in the commotion, Castellini said.

   A Colorado River tour boat smashed into a
sand bar and flung passengers from their chairs onto the deck ``like
ballast,'' injuring 14 people, authorities said.
   Three of those injured in Tuesday's crash suffered broken bones
and cuts, said San Bernardino County sheriff's spokesman Jim Bryant.
The rest suffered shock or complained of chest pain, said sheriff's
Sgt. Dave Austin.
   They were taken to Needles Desert Community Hospital.
   ``The Lord was watching over them, I'll tell you,'' sheriff's
spokeswoman Nancy Wegner said of the boat's 44 passengers.
   The accident happened shortly before noon as the boat, piloted by
Lyle Browning, made its way along the river near Ski Beach during a
two-hour sightseeing cruise, authorities said.
   The 50-foot boat was on a tour that normally leaves the gambling
resort town of Laughlin, Nev., turns around under the London Bridge
in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., and returns to Laughlin.
   ``They got down there and were coming back. The water is low
now,'' Bryant said. ``The captain saw the sand and sped up the
vessel to lift the boat over the sand bar. But it didn't lift. It
was going a pretty good speed. The people on board in chairs got
tossed around like ballast.''
   The boat is owned by Laughlin River Tours Inc., said a company
official who refused to give her name or comment further.

<HEAD>Psychiatrists: Confessed TWA Hijacker Mentally Competent for Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychiatric experts said today
that confessed hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi is mentally competent to
stand trial, despite head wounds he received during fighting in his
native Beirut.
   Hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in the June 14, 1985
hijacking of a TWA jetliner in which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem
was slain. Hamadi admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied
killing Stethem.
   Following the seizure of the Athens-to-Rome flight, 39 Americans
were held hostage for 17 days.
   The Frankfurt court, acting on a defense request in November,
ordered psychiatric tests for Hamadi after it was revealed in court
testimony that he had received head wounds in fighting in Beirut,
where a civil war has raged for 13 years.
   Willi Schumacher and Hasso Sachs, professors of psychiatry at
Giessen University, 35 miles north of Frankfurt, testified today on
the results of their tests of Hamadi.
   Schumacher said Hamadi's mental processes ``are quick, coherent,
and concise.'' His head has some scars, but ``none of them is
sensitive to outside pressure,'' Schumacher said.
   He said the defendant's reflexes were normal and that Hamadi had
no coordination problems.
   ``Mr. Hamadi is in all respects mentally fit,'' Schumacher said.
   Sachs said he tested Hamadi for mental disturbances, intellectual
development and concentration. He described the defendant as
``orderly thinking, and stable.''
   ``He was friendly, courteous, cooperative, absolutely not
withdrawn,'' Sachs said.
   Sachs said his tests showed Hamadi was of average intelligence
and that ``cerebal damage could not be established, indicating a
fully healthy brain.''
   Following the psychiatrists' testimony, the defense asked that
Hamadi be given additional tests. Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger
did not immediately rule on the request.
   The trial, which began July 5, resumed this week after a break of
nearly one month.
   Hamadi has been kept in Frankfurt's Preungesheim prison since his
arrest at the city's airport Jan. 23, 1987. He was arrested after
being caught with liquid explosives in his luggage.
   The United States requested his extradition, but following the
kidnapping of two West Germans in Beirut, West Germany said he would
be tried here instead.
   Hamadi's brother, Abbas Hamadi, was sentenced by a Duesseldorf
court in April to 13 years in prison for his part in kidnapping the
West Germans, allegedly to win Mohammed's freedom.
   The two West Germans have since been freed.

<HEAD>Oil Imports Highest Since 1979, API Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. oil imports last year jumped to the
highest level since 1979 as consumption rose and domestic production
hit a 12-year low, an industry trade group said today.
   The American Petroleum Institute, representing the major oil
producers and refiners, said U.S. oil production fell to 8.1 million
barrels a day, a nearly 3 percent drop from 1987.
   The rate was the lowest since 1976, the year before production
began at the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field on the North Slope of
Alaska.
   Oil production in the 48 contiguous states last year was the
lowest since 1950, the group said.
   Imports of oil surged to a rate of 7.2 million barrels a day, a
nearly 9 percent increase over 1987. The record peak for oil imports
was 8.8 million barrels a day in 1977, two years before the Iranian
revolution sparked the secon oil crisis of the decade.
   The rise in imports and drop in domestic production highlight
what the independent, mostly smaller, U.S. oil producers say is an
urgent need for Congress to adopt some form of legislation to
protect the industry from cheap foreign oil.
   One proposal likely to face the new Congress is a fee on imported
oil, which proponents say would curb the trend toward higher imports
and lower domestic output. The American Petroleum Institute has not
taken an official position on this issue.
   The institute's latest report said total U.S. energy use last
year rose to the highest level ever, to 80 quads, a standard measure
of energy consumption that is equal to a quadrillion British thermal
units. One Btu is defined as the amount of heat required to raise
the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
   Despite the rise in overall energy use, oil's share of total
consumption continued to decline, to 42 percent, compared with 43
percent in 1987 and 49 percent in 1977.
   Use of electricity, coal and natural gas all rose by about 5
percent last year, the report said.
   Gasoline consumption continued an upward trend last year, but at
a slower rate than in recent years. Use rose 1.6 percent in 1988,
which the trade organization attributed in part to a general decline
in retail gasoline prices in recent years. Consumption had risen 2.4
percent in 1987 and 3 percent the year before.

<HEAD>Two Maryland Men Arrested in 1979 Deaths of Elderly Pair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nearly 10 years of dead-ends, police
have arrested two men for killing an elderly sister and brother who
died of thirst and hunger after being left trussed in their home in
1979.
   John Arthur Askew, 51, of Princess Anne, Md., and Robert Paul
O'Neill, 40, of Finksburg, Md., have been charged with homicide in
the case, Lancaster County Assistant District Attorney John A.
Kenneff said Tuesday.
   The two suspects allegedly bound and gagged Mary and Horace Swarr
and robbed their home of an undetermined quantity of coins and
currency on or about Sept. 10, 1979.
   Someone _ apparently one of the robbers _ later called police and
reported that an elderly couple had been tied up and robbed at 442
E. Walnut St. The Swarrs lived at 432 W. Walnut St.
   Police found the trussed couple seven days later after a
newspaper carrier reported seeing a large number of newspapers on
the doorstep of the Swarr home.
   By the time they were discovered, Mary Swarr, 57, was dead. Her
81-year-old brother died the following day. According to criminal
complaints released Tuesday, both died of dehydration and
malnutrition.
   At a news conference Tuesday night, authorities said the
perplexing case was finally broken through a 1987 tip from Baltimore
County police that led to an extended investigation of the two
suspects, who were arrested Saturday.
   Two others suspects are under investigation in the case,
authorities said, but their identities were not released.
   Askew waived extradition Tuesday and should be returned to
Lancaster from Maryland within seven days, Kenneff said. O'Neill's
extradition hearing began Tuesday and was scheduled to today in
Carroll County, Md.

   A South Carolina school where a gunman

shooting rampage.
   ``We will tell them they can survive this,'' said Kat Finkbeiner,

spree last year at Greenwood's Oakland Elementary School. ``I would
tell them, `Lean on your community, share the sorrow.' We've lived

   On Sept. 26, a man with a history of mental problems opened fire
with a handgun at Oakland Elementary School, killing two youngsters
and wounding nine other people. Ms. Finkbeiner helped subdue the
gunman, Jamie Wilson, 19.
   On Tuesday, a 26-year-old drifter with a long crimnal record
opened fire with an assault rifle at Cleveland Elementary School in
Stockton, Calif., killing five children and wounding 30 other people
before taking his own life.
   ``It's unpleasant. It's unhappy, but they can live through it;
they can be happy another day,'' Ms. Finkbeiner said.
   Children at the Greenwood school will be asked to send cards to
the California school, while the principal, Eleanor Rice, and Ms.
Finkbeiner said they will contact officials at the Stockton school
to offer encouragement.
   ``Our wounds have not closed. We are still hurting. It makes us
more compassionate for these people,'' the principal said.
   Eveline Higginbotham, the third-grade teacher in whose classroom
the two little girls died, said the California tragedy ``just brings
it all back again.''
   ``I'm just in shock,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was shouted off
the podium in Parliament today by left-wing legislators when he
tried to defend tougher tactics for putting down the Palestinian
uprising.
   Right-wing critics of the government said it was not doing enough
to end the revolt against Israel's 21-year occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The army closed Palestinian schools in four West Bank cities for
three days and three others for 10 days. The closures were aimed at
stopping the violence that has taken the lives of at least 13
teen-agers in the past week, the army said.
   In violence today, two Palestinian teen-agers were wounded in a
clash with troops in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, Arab news
reports said.
   An Israeli driver and a Palestinian passenger suffered minor
injuries when a firebomb was thrown at a bus near the West Bank city
of Ramallah, Israel radio reported.
   Rabin came under fire in the legislature for his latest policy of
allowing troops to shoot plastic or rubber bullets at stone-throwers
even as they flee, and for expanding the number of troops allowed to
shoot.
   Plastic and rubber bullets were introduced as a less lethal
method of quelling riots than live ammunition, but they have been
blamed for several deaths, including eight of the teen-agers killed
in the past week.
   Three deaths Tuesday brought the number of Palestinians killed in
the 13-month uprising to 362. Fifteen Israelis have died.
   Another part of the new policy calls for punishing stone-throwers
by wrecking or sealing their homes or confiscating their families'
property.
   ``As long as the residents of the (occupied) territories aren't
ready to sit down at the negotiating table, as long as they respond
with violence, rocks and bottles, they will not make us run away,
they will not make us surrender. They will suffer,'' Rabin said.
   Hecklers interrupted him at least a dozen times before he stopped
speaking and angrily took his seat. Some critics called for his
resignation.
   One detractor, Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Citizens' Rights
Movement, said: ``This policy is not only killing Palestinians but
also the souls of Israeli soldiers. I say to you that for the sake
of our future and our common destiny, ours and the Palestinians ...
I say to you Mr. Defense Minister, go.''
   The debate followed the introduction of no-confidence motions by
eight factions against the government's handling of the latest
violence.
   Rehavam Zeevi of the ultra-nationalist Homeland Party, which
seeks the expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the occupied lands,
represented one of three parties that criticized Rabin for not going
far enough.
   ``Children and teen-agers are running wild in the villages and on
the roads ... For them it's a festival. For us, a continuous Yom
Kippur,'' the Jewish Day of Atonement, Zeevi said. ``There is no
justification for this.''
   The Cabinet, which includes the right-wing Likud bloc and the
left-leaning Labor Party, was expected to easily defeat the
no-confidence motions from the small parties.
   Also today, police fired rubber bullets to quell one disturbance
at a high school in Arab east Jerusalem and detained eight
demonstrators, police spokesman Rafi Levy said.
   An army statement said most of the school closures were meant to
prevent further violence and thwart student plans to stage strikes
``for reasons that have nothing to do with education, such as house
demolitions.''
   In line with the new army policy, soldiers Tuesday dynamited
three homes of Palestinians in the West Bank town of Qalqiliya.
   Palestinian merchants closed their shops and public
transportation came to a halt in Jenin, Ramallah, Qalqilya and Arab
east Jerusalem in protest of the latest demolitions and the rash of
deaths, Arab reports said.

   Despite warnings from other Justice Department
officials, former Attorney General Edwin Meese III remained blind to
ethical problems raised by his actions on behalf of lobbyist E.
Robert Wallach, the Justice Department says.
   The report, issued Tuesday, concludes that Meese violated federal
ethics standards. An attachment to the report shows more than 600
contacts between Meese and the San Francisco lawyer from the time
the Reagan administration came to power.
   Meese's assistance to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. in 1981 and
1983 and his efforts on behalf of a proposed Mideast oil pipeline in
1985 were three instances in which his friendship with Wallach
``dictated'' federal actions, said the report by the department's
Office of Professional Responsibility.
   Wallach, who collected $1.3 million from Wedtech from 1982 to
1986, is awaiting trial in New York on racketeering and other
charges. He is accused of peddling his connection to Meese.
   White House spokesmen Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan
believes that Meese, his longtime friend, had done nothing wrong.
And he said ``this report was unnecessary, partly because Mr. Meese
has not been in the office for some time and partly because it was
unwarranted.''
   Then-Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and criminal division
chief William Weld ``recognized the impropriety of Mr. Wallach's
activities and advised Mr. Meese to repudiate them,'' said the
report, but Meese continued to meet with Wallach and receive letters
and memos from him as he had since 1981.
   Burns and Weld resigned last March to protest Meese's continued
tenure at the department while he was under criminal investigation.
   ``Despite the ability of others to perceive potential problems
with Mr. Wallach's actions, Mr. Meese remained blind to them and
made no effort to distance himself from Mr. Wallach,'' the ethics
report concluded.
   It said that other people who weren't even close to Meese ``could
recognize problems with Mr. Wallach's actions'' and that ``certainly
Mr. Meese's internal warning bell should have gone off.''
   The report is especially critical of Meese's actions in
connection with the oil pipeline, in which Meese arranged a meeting
between then-national security adviser Robert McFarlane, Wallach and
Wallach's client, Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport. At the time, Meese
was liable for legal fees to Wallach, who had represented him in a
criminal investigation in 1984.
   ``Mr. Meese knew when he became involved in the pipeline matter
that Mr. Wallach had a financial interest in the project and that he
was potentially liable to Mr. Wallach'' for more than $142,000 in
legal fees, said the report. ``Despite this knowledge, Mr. Meese
acceded to Mr. Wallach's request that he call Mr. McFarlane.''
Wallach's fees eventually were paid by the government.
   Meese spokesman Patrick Korten complained that the report had an
``emotional undertone'' about Meese that was designed ``to slam him
personally.''
   George Walker, an attorney for Wallach, said Wallach and Meese
both had acted properly and called the department's report ``old
news.''
   Walker said Wallach simply asked Meese to ensure that Wedtech was
being treated fairly in connection with a $32 million Army engine
contract and that Meese ``didn't participate'' in resolving a 1983
problem involving financing for the company. Wedtech eventually was
awarded the no-bid contract.
   Walker said in regard to the more than 600 contacts between
Wallach and Meese that ``Wallach put all this in writing. We know
there's nothing wrong.''
   But the OPR report said that many letters and memos contain a
``strong undercurrent'' in which Wallach is ``seeking action'' from
Meese and his staff on matters in which Wallach had a financial
interest.
   ``Mr. Wallach traded on his ability to invoke Mr. Meese's
authority to facilitate achieving the ends he sought,'' the report
said. ``Mr. Meese, it appears, was, at best, oblivious to Mr.
Wallach's method of operation.''
   Meese's successor as attorney general, Dick Thornburgh, tried to
avoid characterizing the OPR report in any way, but ultimately
disagreed with one of its conclusions while saying the others were
adequately based on facts. He said the report is a ``roadmap'' on
how to respond to certain types of situations.
   Thornburgh disagreed with one conclusion that said Meese violated
ethical standards when he failed to sell $14,000 in stock of
regional telephone companies while participating in department
decisions affecting them.
   Independent counsel James McKay decided last summer not to
prosecute Meese, although McKay concluded Meese had probably twice
violated conflict-of-interest laws in connection with his telephone
holdings and had violated tax laws in connection with failing to
report the stock sales.
   The OPR investigation involved ethical rather than criminal
aspects of Meese's actions.

   A 10-year-old boy arrested for selling
cocaine was led away in tears and in handcuffs to a children's
shelter, where he was ordered held because he failed to appear in
court on two previous arrest warrants.
   During a 30-minute hearing Tuesday, Suffolk Family Court Judge
Donald Auperin ordered the boy detained despite his mother's
assurances that she would make sure he showed up at the next
hearing, scheduled for Friday.
   The mother also had been subpoenaed at the boy's two previous
court dates.
   The child, believed to be the youngest suspect ever arrested on
Long Island on drug selling charges, remained silent and showed no
emotion until he apparently realized he would not be released. Then
he began to cry.
   His mother left the courtroom sobbing after watching her son,
wearing sneakers and blue jeans with a rolled-up comic book in his
back pocket, being led away. He was taken to the Nassau County
Children's Shelter in Westbury.
   The boy's attorney entered an innocent plea on the youth's behalf.
   A 14-year-old accomplice, arrested with the 10-year-old, was
released in his mother's custody after his attorney argued that the
boy posed no danger to society.
   Both youths were arrested Sunday after police saw them allegedly
dealing crack cocaine on a streetcorner.
   As the youths tried to flee on a bike, the 10-year-old dropped a
bag containing three $20 crack vials. One of the youths also had
$226 in cash in his pocket, police said.
   Suffolk police are seeking a man who is believed to have hired
the boys to sell the drugs for him.

   Police broke into a church early today
and dragged away a Sri Lankan who had taken refuge there and was
sleeping handcuffed to a radiator, his supporters said.
   Home Office Minister Timothy Renton said Viraj Mendis, 32, would
be sent back to Sri Lanka if he did not find another country to
accept him by Friday.
   Mendis says he faces persecution and possible death in his native
country because of his communist beliefs and support for the Tamil
minority. The British government and courts disagree.
   The Rev. John Methuen of the Church of the Ascension said police
arrived at his home about 7:30 a.m. and broke down the door leading
to the vestry where Mendis was staying with two supporters.
   Methuen said there was ``quite a lot'' of damage done to the
building.
   A Home Office spokesman confirmed that two immigration officers
and 50 police officers forced their way into the Church of England
premises in northern England.
   ``The door into the sacristy (or vestry) was a large wooden door
which was heavily bolted and barred,'' said Terry Platt, head of the
Immigration and Nationality section at the Home Office.
   ``They forced that door with special equipment which had the
result of doing some damage to the door and wall.''
   Ingrid Falat, a member of the church council, said Mendis was
``handcuffed to the radiator in the room ... they dragged him out by
his hands and feet.''
   Falat and other witnesses said the police used acetylene torches
to remove the handcuffs.
   Mendis has lost two immigration appeals, a High Court judicial
review and a Court of Appeal review of a deportation order issued in
December 1986.
   Last month, Britain's highest court, the Law Lords of the House
of Lords, also refused to hear his case.
   Mendis took refuge in the church Dec. 20, 1986, two days after
Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, the senior Cabinet minister responsible
for immigration, signed the deportation order against him for
``overstaying'' in Britain.
   Mendis was trying to revive the ancient right of sanctuary, which
dates back to the Old Testament and had a long tradition in Britain
until it was abolished by Parliament in 1623. The medieval sanctuary
at London's Westminster Abbey harbored so many people it was said to
resemble a small town.
   Mendis came to Britain in 1973 on a student visa to study at the
University of Manchester. He ran into financial difficulties after
two years, dropped out, went to work and joined a communist splinter
group.
   Mendis is a member of Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority but has
actively supported the rights of the Tamil minority. Tamil rebels
are fighting for an independent homeland in Sri Lanka.
   ``The Sri Lankan government have, in the past, given assurances
that he is not wanted in Sri Lanka for any offense and is free to go
there without impediment,'' Renton said in a statement.
   ``We have always felt that the situation in Sri Lanka did not
justify the position that Mendis and his supporters were adopting.''

   Rioters set fires and looted stores early today as
700 police officers poured into two black neighborhoods, arresting
hundreds in an attempt to halt two days of racial violence in which
two people have died.
   The violence eased toward dawn, enabling police to reduce their
presence.
   The riots, which began Monday night in the Overtown section
following the shooting death of a black motoryclist by a police
officer there, spread to the Liberty City neighborhood Tuesday. The
violence, which broke out as Miami made final preparations for
Sunday's Super Bowl, forced the cancellation of a National
Basketball Association game Tuesday night.
   ``Things have quieted a lot since about 2 a.m.,'' said police
spokesman David Rivero. ``We have pulled back some of the
blockades.''
   Rivero said some sections of Overtown's business district were
still closed to traffic at 6:30 a.m., but most roads were open in
the mostly residential Liberty City area.
   Two fires were burning in Liberty City at dawn, including a
church that was being allowed to burn to the ground, Rivero said.
   The U.S. Justice Department began an investigation of the
cyclist's shooting, which led to the death of the man's passenger
after the motorcyle crashed. The city also was investigating the
shooting; the City Council convened for an emergency session today.
   ``For the sake of our city, I appeal to every citizen, regardless
of race to stay calm, get off the streets and stay in your homes,''
said Mayor Xavier Suarez in a televised appeal Tuesday night.
   Police, who earlier had stood by to protect lives and property,
took a more assertive role late Tuesday, arresting troublemakers. By
early today, 250 arrests had been made, mostly for burglaries, said
police Sgt. Michael Mazur. The suspects were being held at the Dade
County Jail pending bail hearings, according to a jail spokeswoman
who would not give her name.
   The 1{ square mile Overtown section and a small part of Liberty
City were cordoned off by police. The decision to sweep through the
areas and make arrests came after sniping incidents increased,
police said.
   In Liberty City, northwest of Overtown, a 16-year-old black youth
was killed late Tuesday in a shooting apparently unrelated to the
rioting. Metro-Dade police Sgt. John Roper said Troy Robinson was
shot to death during an argument over a stolen check-printing
marchine. Howard Scippio, 37, of Miami, was arrested and charged
with first-degree murder.
   In Overtown, just north of downtown, two people were shot
Tuesday, one of them in the leg by police. Five others were shot in
Liberty City, including a police officer who was wearing a
bulletproof vest and was not seriously injured by sniper fire.
   A white man in a luxury car fired a gun into a crowd of
rock-throwing blacks early Tuesday afternoon, wounding a 19-year-old
man who was hospitalized in fair condition.
   Gunfire and rock-throwing in the area of Miami Arena, which is in
Overtown, forced the postponement of Tuesday night's NBA game
between the Miami Heat and Phoenix Suns.
   A meat truck, furniture stores and several smaller stores were
looted, Mazur said. The Liberty City community center was set ablaze
as were at least a half dozen other buildings.
   A white motorist whose car broke down was beaten but managed to
run toward police for protection, and an Associated Press
photographer was roughed up by a mob and his car torched.
   ``I saw someone coming around a building and throwing rocks, and
I said `Let's go, get out of here,''' said photographer Mark
Pesetsky, who escaped after police fired tear gas at the crowd.
   At least two other beatings were reported, and several people
were treated for lacerations, Jackson Memorial Hospital officials
said.
   Police worked 17-hour shifts and ran out of riot bags, equipped
with a gas mask, shield, baton, helmet and handcuffs. Weary officers
arrived at Miami police headquarters downtown, hoping for a respite
in the violence.
   Most Miamians remained unaffected by the rioting, which was
confined to a relatively small portion of the central city.
   The closest many got to the riot scene was on Interstate 95,
which passes over the western edge of Overtown, or on the Dolphin
Expressway, which intersects I-95 near the troubled area. Motorists
could see and smell smoke from fires set by rioters and there were
isolated incidents of rocks and bottles being thrown at cars.
   The violence erupted following the shooting death of 23-year-old
Clement Anthony Lloyd during a police pursuit. A passenger on the
motorcycle, Allen Blanchard, 24, died Tuesday.
   Lloyd was shot in the head by Officer William Lozano, a four-year
police veteran who was investigating an unrelated incident when
Lloyd sped by, authorities said.
   Lloyd and Blanchard were unarmed and were being pursued for a
speeding violation, said police spokesman Angelo Bitsis.
   Within hours, a mob of blacks surrounded the crash scene and
began throwing rocks and bottles.
   Lozano, 29, a Colombian immigrant who had been on the squad for
three years, was automatically suspended with pay pending an
investigation.
   The U.S. Justice Department ordered the FBI to investigate the
shooting.
   Suarez also promised an investigation and said he would name an
independent review panel of private citizens, who could meet as
early as today.
   ``We will not rest until we come to the bottom of what happened
to spark this riot,'' Suarez added.
   School officials said six Overtown schools closed after the first
night of riots would reopen today.
   Overtown is about 15 miles from Joe Robbie Stadium, site of the
Super Bowl. The Cincinnati Bengals, who play the San Francisco 49ers
in the National Football League championship game, are staying less
than a mile from Overtown, at the Omni Hotel.
   Some community leaders blamed the violence on what is perceived
in the black community as favoritism toward Hispanic refugees.
   ``In this tremendous influx of refugees from Central and South
America, the African-Americans have felt cheated. We felt we were
losing our place in the city,'' said Johnnie McMillian, president of
the Miami-Dade branch of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
   The violence recalled bloody riots in Liberty City in 1980 and
Overtown in 1982 following incidents in which black men were shot to
death by police.

<HEAD>Imprisoned Colleagues Visited Mandela Before Christmas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four imprisoned African
National Congress leaders, convicted in 1964 with Nelson Mandela,
were allowed to visit their ANC colleague at his isolated prison
house, an activist said today.
   The four men, all held at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, were
taken to nearby Victor Verster Prison on Dec. 23 and spent about six
hours with Mandela, said Dullah Omar, an activist and family friend
of the Mandelas.
   Mandela was moved to the suburban-style home on the prison
grounds Dec. 7 after recovering from tuberculosis at a private
clinic in Cape Town.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, said after visiting her husband last
month that he is being held ``practically in solitary confinement''
at the house.
   The four men who visited Mandela are Walter Sisulu, Andrew
Mhlangeni, Raymond Mhlaba and Ahmed Kathrada.
   The men were convicted along with Mandela and three others at the
same trial in 1964. All were given life sentences for their
activities with the ANC, the main guerrilla group attempting to
overthrow the white-led government.
   ``All of them _ except Sisulu _ had not seen Nelson since 1986,
and they were very excited at being able to spend time with him,''
Omar said.
   Of the three co-defendants not at the Dec. 23 gathering, two have
been released and one remains at the Robben Island Prison near Cape
Town.
   The Prisons Service declined to confirm or deny the visit.

   A West German businessman who pleaded guilty to
conspiring to export American aircraft navigational systems to Iran
in violation of a U.S. embargo has been sentenced to five years
probation.
   The sentence imposed Tuesday on Bernd Pleuger, former managing
director of Beechcraft Vertrieb Und Service Co. of Munich, was
recommended by Assistant U.S. Attorney Phil Halpern, who said
Plueger had a secondary role in the scheme.
   Plueger, 51, of Augsburg, West Germany, and Juergen Zimmermann,
37, one of the company's sales representatives, both pleaded guilty
to trying to bribe a U.S. official, an undercover Customs agent, and
conspiring to illegally export the radar systems. Zimmermann is to
be sentenced April 17.
   The radar systems are produced primarily by Teledyne Ryan
Electronics of San Diego for the U.S. military. Beechcraft Vertrieb
sells, services and distributes parts for Beechcraft Aircraft Corp.
of Wichita, Kan., and other manufacturers.

<HEAD>Cosmonauts Show No Great Effects of Year in Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cosmonauts who spent a year in space suffered
fewer physical effects than expected, and there do not appear to be
any barriers to even longer missions, Soviet space specialists said
today.
   ``Longer flights, we believe, are quite possible, and we think
they will be carried out,'' Anatoly Grigoryev, director of the
Institute of Bio-Medical Problems of the Soviet Health Ministry,
told a news conference.
   Grigoryev said cosmonauts Musa Manarov and Vladimir Titov, who
returned to Earth on Dec. 21 after a year in space, suffered some
atrophy of their calf muscles and some loss of calcium, as have
other cosmonauts.
   But because of exercise and training developed by Soviet
scientists, the effects suffered by Manarov and Tito were less
severe than their predecessors', he said.
   Titov, Manarov and French cosmonaut Jean-Loup Chretien also
attended the news conference. Chretien spent a month on the Mir
orbiting space complex before returning with Titov and Manarov, who
hold the space endurance record.
   Titov said he and Manarov noticed some atrophy of their leg
muscles in the weightless conditions aboard the Mir complex.
   He said he had been afraid about the effects of the long period
of weightlessness when he returned to Earth, ``but our ideas were
bleaker than reality. We feel quite well, better than expected.''
   Scientists said results of tests done on Titov and Manarov still
are being analyzed.
   In response to a reporter's question, Alexander Dunayev, head of
the Glavkosmos space agency, said Soviet officials still had not
decided whether the second flight of the space shuttle Buran will be
manned or unmanned.
   He said technological and economic disagreements about Buran's
next flight had not been settled and that a date for the second
flight was not set.
   Glavkosmos is the space agency charged with development of space
engineering for the economy.
   Buran was launched Nov. 15 on a three-hour, 20 minute unmanned
flight. But the Soviet press has referred several times to an
internal debate about the shuttle program. Soviet space officials
for years scorned the U.S. shuttle program as inefficient before
unveiling a similar-looking craft.

   Bandits shot and killed a security guard in
a botched attack on an armored car, police said today.
   Eight or nine masked gunmen fired a hail of machine-gun rounds to
stop the armored car Tuesday night at a railroad crossing near this
northern town, according to police.
   Antonio Bozzi, 37, a guard riding in the rear of the car, was
struck in the head and killed by at least one of the bullets, which
police said had probably been intended as warning shots.
   Two guards in the front got out of the car and the bandits
grabbed what police described as a ``modest'' amount of money. They
said the bandits fired their weapons at the back of the car in an
attempt to break open the back door, but they couldn't get the door
open and fled.
   The Italian news agency ANSA reported the gunmen were believed to
be those responsible for a Nov. 9 robbery in Bergamo, about 30 miles
away.
   In that attack, gunmen engaged in a shootout with guards before
fleeing with $425,000.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study at a Boston hospital serving inner-city
residents found that nearly one in five expectant mothers used
cocaine, sparking concern among doctors who reported an increase in
addicted newborns.
   ``It's very alarming,'' said Dr. Barry Zuckerman of Boston City
Hospital. ``Cocaine is not only bad during pregnancy, but being a
cocaine abuser is not a great way for a child to be reared.''
   Zuckerman, of the hospital's Division of Development Behavioral
Pediatrics, conducted the study of 1,226 pregnant woman, most of
whom were from the inner city. The study found that 18 percent had
used cocaine at least once during pregnancy, the Boston Herald
reported today.
   Nearly a quarter of those who admitted using cocaine said they
took the drug three or more times a week.
   Zuckerman said he expects to complete the study in six months. He
is analyzing the data to determine the impact of cocaine use on
developing fetuses.
   ``We were actually studying the effects of marijuana during
pregnancy, but it became clear cocaine was used more frequently, so
we looked at the effects of cocaine,'' he said.
   A study released last summer by the National Association for
Perinatal Addiction Research and Education showed that at least 11
percent of women in 36 hospitals had used illegal drugs during
pregnancy. The hospitals were chosen to represent a range of
socio-economic levels among patients.

   A bomb exploded early today
outside the top-security Crumlin Road courthouse in Belfast in the
second such attack in eight days, police said.
   Also today, two masked men shot to death a man working in a store
at central Belfast's Smithfield Market, police said.
   The man was dead on arrival at Royal Victoria Hospital, said a
spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Police would not
identify the victim, but Press Association, the domestic British
news agency, said he was Ian Catney, 25, a Roman Catholic who was
working in his mother's store.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the shooting or the
bombing.
   The area in which the explosion occurred had been evacuated and
there were no injuries, said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, requesting anonymity. Damage was slight, he said.
   The bomb had been placed in a hijacked car taken from a family
held hostage in the Springfield Road area of mainly Roman Catholic
west Belfast, he said.
   Gunmen opened fire on a British army post atop the Crumlin Road
courthouse and prison building on Jan. 10 and left a car bomb in a
hijacked car nearby. There were no injuries in that incident, and
bomb experts defused the bomb.

   President Reagan said today the request of
newspaper heiress Patty Hearst Shaw for a pardon has not come to his
desk for attention, and an administration official cautioned against
expecting any ``too extraordinary'' pardons during Reagan's final
days in office.
   ``There are always pardons coming across my desk from the Justice
Department,'' Reagan told reporters.
   Asked specifically about Mrs. Shaw, convicted for her role in a
San Francisco bank robbery 14 years ago, the president said, ``No,
that hasn't come to my desk for attention yet.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``There are pardons
that are in the system, but I don't have any status report on
whether or not he has had a chance to review them.''
   A senior official, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said Reagan has pardoned 10 people in the last few weeks through the
normal process, in which they are announced by the courts rather
than the White House.
   ``My private guidance is not to expect anything too extraordinary
here in the form of pardons,'' the official said. He added, however,
that Reagan has not made final decisions and ``I can never preempt
the president.''
   The official said former national security aide Oliver L. North,
Mrs. Shaw and industrialist Armand Hammer were in the category of
potential pardon recipients he had in mind as ``extraordinary.''
   With time running out on his two-term presidency, Reagan has ``as
many as a couple of dozen'' requests still pending, said the source
who declined to be publicly identified.
   Mrs. Shaw, 34, said earlier this week that she did not know if
Reagan's expression of interest in her case means she stands a good
chance of being pardoned.
   Reagan has been reluctant to discuss the subject of pardons,
although he did tell reporters Sunday that ``I have asked everybody
to look into'' the Shaw case. He has repeatedly said he plans no
pardon for North, who faces a trial on an array of charges related
to the Iran-Contra affair.
   The administration source would not divulge the names of the 10
pardon requests that Reagan reviewed and referred back to the
Justice Department. ``There are no big names,'' he said.
   Spokesman Fitzwater had told reporters Tuesday, ``It's certainly
possible that a decision could be made (on Shaw) before he leaves.''
   Patty Hearst was sentenced to seven years in a federal prison for
her role in the 1974 armed robbery of a San Francisco bank. She now
is married and living in Connecticut with her husband and two
daughters under the married name of Patty Hearst Shaw.
   Shaw, granddaughter of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst,
last August quietly asked for a pardon for her role in the robbery.
She has maintained she was brainwashed by the radical Symbionese
Liberation Army, a group of revolutionaries who kidnapped her in
Berkeley, Calif., in February 1974 and orchestrated the bank heist.
   Her seven-year sentence was commuted by President Carter and she
was released from prison on Feb. 1, 1979, after serving 23 months.
   In an interview Monday with The Advocate of Stamford at her
Westport, Conn., home, Shaw said, ``It's a little premature for
anything like that. If he (Reagan) doesn't approve it, it would go
to the next administration.''
   Attention also is being given to a longstanding pardon request by
Hammer, the Los Angeles industrialist and head of Occidental
Petroleum Corp. He was fined $3,000 and placed on a year's probation
in connection with his guilty plea to three misdemeanor charges in
connection with the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s.
   Fitzwater said that he would not ``comment on any individuals
that are in this category. Some of them are recent. Some of them,
we've had for weeks or for months.''
   The administration official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity said that the pardon approvals ``tend to trickle over. ...
We got 10 back from the White House, approved, last week.''
   Under routine procedure, the Justice Department's pardons office
would contact the person receiving a pardon or that person's
attorney, he said.

   Federal racketeering charges were filed against 18
former employees of a now defunct commodities brokerage firm accused
of defrauding 2,600 investors out of about $40 million.
   The charges, announced Tuesday, grew out of the largest
investigation of its kind ever undertaken by the federal government,
according to U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas.
   The 18 former Chicago area employees of First Commodity Corp. of
Boston, all named in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury
and in a criminal information, were charged with 187 counts of
racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, wire and mail fraud, Valukas
said.
   The company's former national vice president for sales, two
branch managers and 15 former salesmen from its Chicago and suburban
Oak Brook offices were accused of using high-pressure tactics to
persuade customers around the country to invest in high-stakes
commodity ventures misrepresented as low-risk.
   Valukas said customers were solicited by First Commodity sales
representatives posing as commodities experts. The representatives
often made repeated phone calls using ``scripts'' handed out by
managers, he said.
   Investors were falsely told that ``commodity trading was not
risky ... and would lead to high profits,'' the prosecutor said.
``In fact ... the defendants knew almost all of FCCB's customers
lost money.''
   During the time covered by the charges, from 1980 to February
1987, the Chicago and Oak Brook offices had $100 million in sales,
of which $63 million was lost, Valukas said.
   More than $40.6 million of those sales and more than $22.7
million of the losses were attributable to the former employees
named in the complaints, Valukas said.
   He declined to say whether more charges were forthcoming, but
noted that the investigation is continuing in Chicago, Boston, New
York, Miami and San Francisco.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michele Smith said the probe was the
largest of its type in several aspects, including the number of
victims _ 2,600 named in Tuesday's charges as well as 44,400 other
customers of the firm during the period of the alleged scheme.
   ``Allegations are that the entire company was operated under
fraud,'' she said today.
   The $600 million raised by First Commodity from 1980 to the
firm's collapse in February 1987 is alleged to have been
fraudulently generated and is the largest sum involved in an alleged
commodities fraud scheme, she said.
   More than 500 FBI agents _ the most ever in such a case _ have
been involved in the probe, Ms. Smith said. In November, three
former salesmen for the company pleaded guilty in the investigation
and agreed to cooperate with federal agents.
   First Commodity was founded in the late 1970s, and rapidly grew
into one of the nation's leading futures trading companies. But it
collapsed in 1987 under a mountain of investor lawsuits and federal
investigations.
   The newest defendants include David C. Connolly, 48, of Teaneck,
N.J., First Commodity's former national sales vice president; former
Oak Brook branch manager Ross A. Barnard, 37 of suburban Hinsdale;
and Barnard's brother, Stephen L. Barnard, 38, of suburban
Flossmoor, former house broker at the Chicago office.
   Neither Connolly nor the Barnards could be reached for comment.
The Barnards had unpublished numbers and Connolly was not listed in
the Teaneck area.
   If convicted, the defendants could face lengthy prison terms and
thousands of dollars in fines.
   ``It is a sad reality that sophisticated and deceptive sales
techniques can yield great profits to those willing to use them,''
Valukas said. ``These cases should serve as a clear warning that
fraud and deception in the offer and sale of commodity contracts _
in whatever form it takes _ will be thoroughly investigated and
vigorously prosecuted.''

<TEXT>
   Former Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos is
dying and should not face trial on charges he stole millions of
dollars from his country's treasury, his lawyers said today.
   Attorney Richard A. Hibey asserted that Marcos was mortally ill
after prosecutors dropped their demand that Marcos come to New York
for arraignment and asked instead that he be arraigned in Honolulu.
   They acknowledged that his recent hospitalization for pneumonia
would delay any travel for more than a month.
   Marcos, 71, who has been living in exile in Honolulu since 1986,
is hospitalized there with pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma,
according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella.
   Marcos, his wife, Imelda, 59, are accused of plundering $103
million from the Philippines treasury, funneling it to foreign bank
accounts and using it to buy prime New York real estate and art
works.
   From the time of his indictment in October, Marcos had asked that
the arraignment be moved to Hawaii, citing various health problems
including kidney and heart ailments. A government doctor, however,
after examining Marcos there, had pronounced him capable of
traveling to New York for arraignment.
   LaBella requested the court session after Hibey asked U.S.
District Judge John Keenan to turn a hearing on Marcos' ability to
travel to New York for arraignment into one on whether he was
physically competent to ever stand trial.
   ``What began as merely a request to hold Mr. Marcos' arraignment
in Honolulu rather than New York has evolved into a genuine concern
for his life,'' Hibey wrote the judge in a three-page letter dated
Tuesday that included an abbreviated doctor's report.
   ``We have been advised by the last doctor who examined President
Marcos that he is dying,'' Hibey's letter concluded. ``The court
should receive all evidence relating to his health and determine at
this stage that, if persuaded that such is the case, the prosecution
should not go forward against him.''
   But LaBella surprised the defense and U.S. District Judge John F.
Keenan by reversing his previous stand and requesting that ``Mr.
Marcos be arraigned as promptly as possible in Hawaii.''
   LaBella said Marcos' recent hospitalization ``would keep him from
traveling for four to six weeks'' and ``further delay is now
prejudicing the government's case.''
   LaBella said other defendants might seek to go to trial sooner
than Marcos is able _ prompting the government to conduct more than
one trial.
   But Hibey argued that Marcos' most recent hospitalization
``doesn't begin to tell the story'' of Marcos' ``multi-system
illnesses.''
   ``It's a question, your honor, of an ability to survive,'' Hibey
said.
   Keenan decided that a hearing Thursday in Manhattan would
consider both aspects: Marcos' ability to travel for arraignment and
his physical ability to stand trial at any time.

<HEAD>Gynecologist Offers to Give Up Medical Certificate, Attorney Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gynecologist who faces charges from the
State Medical Board for allegedly performing unnecessary surgery on
women has offered to surrender his certificate to practice medicine,
his attorney said.
   Attorney Earl Moore said Tuesday that he and Dr. James C. Burt
made the offer while meeting with state officials in Columbus.
   The board has charged Burt, a 67-year-old Dayton doctor, with
gross immorality for 41 alleged violations ranging from
overprescribing drugs to performing unnecessary surgeries.
   Most of the charges against Burt have to do with his
self-described ``love surgery,'' in which he rebuilt women's genital
areas, allegedly to enhance their sexual responsiveness. The
surgery, however, caused sexual dysfunction, emotional distress,
infection, chronic pain, incontinence and the need for corrective
surgery in many patients, the board charged.
   Burt sent a letter to the board last month denying the charges
and requesting a hearing. The board tentatively set a Jan. 30
hearing date.
   But Moore said Tuesday his client ``offered to surrender the
license and dispense with the hearing. Whether they do that or not,
I don't know. Otherwise, we'll go ahead with the hearing.''
   He said Burt has, in effect, retired anyway. ``He's not
practicing any medicine at all,'' Moore said.
   State Medical Board spokeswoman Lauren Lubow did not immediately
return telephone calls for comment today. Calls to Burt's office
went unanswered today.
   Ms. Lubow has said the severest penalty the state board could
impose would be permanent revocation of Burt's license. The board
limited the doctor to non-surgical medical practice in November.
   At least three of Burt's former patients have each filed $3
million medical malpractice suits against the gynecologist.
   Burt has denied performing the surgery without his patients'
permission.

<HEAD>Bush Tells Teachers He Will Make Good on Promise to Be Education
President</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 8 grafs at end with Cavazos, teacher comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush, beginning the whirlwind
of official activities leading up to his inauguration, promised 250
top school teachers today that he will make good on his promise to
become ``the education president.''
   ``Education will be on my desk and on my mind right from the
start, every day,'' Bush told teachers gathered from every state at
a forum in the National Museum of Women in the Arts.
   Paying tribute to their profession, Bush said, ``My most
important message to American teachers is a message of appreciation.
...I am awed by your work.
   ``It is tough work and it's indispensable work and it deserves as
much praise and thanks as any job in any profession in America,'' he
said.
   ``Certainly you deserve more public recognition than you usually
get.''
   Then, adding words similar to those his defeated Democratic
rival, Michael Dukakis, often used in the campaign, Bush added,
``Teaching should be one of America's honored professions and I will
work to make sure that it is exactly that.''
   Teachers invited to the symposium were nominated by state
teacher-of-the-year programs, teacher unions, governors, state
inaugural committee chairmen and the Republican National Committee's
Teacher Advisory Committee.
   The teachers heard two former governors, John Sununu of New
Hampshire and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, discuss state efforts to
improve schools, and listened to Secretary of Education Lauro
Cavazos outline the new administration's goals. Sununu will be
Bush's White House chief of staff.
   ``This is my very first event on the inaugural calendar.
...That's the way I wanted it, meeting with educators,'' he said.
``I know you've heard me say during this campaign that I intended to
be the education president. Two days before I begin trying I wanted
you to know that I meant it.
   ``The country is now wide awake to the central role of our
schools in determining the future health of our society,'' he said.
   Even under budgetary constraints, Bush said, ``we're going to
work to make sure that the nation does what needs to be done for our
schools: reward excellence, weigh standards, expand choice,
publicize success, strive to resolve shortcomings and keep American
attention and effort concentrated on further education reform and
improvement.''
   Bush said repeatedly during the campaign that he wanted to be
``the education president.'' He has promised to convene an education
summit of governors, university presidents and other leading
educators early in his administration.
   Cavazos told the teachers the Bush administration's new $500
million ``merit schools'' program will place particular emphasis on
reducing dropout rates. The program will provide recognition and
financial rewards ``to schools that are accountable and work,'' said
Cavazos.
   They will be rated on standards defined by the state ``with some
federal guidance,'' he said, on such measures as test scores,
college participation rates, employment of graduates and ``success
in improving school participation and performance of the
disadvantaged and the handicapped.''
   Paul Parets, a band teacher at Alexias I. DuPont High School in
Wilmington, Del., said, ``I was very moved. I sat there thinking he
could have met with the heads of foreign states, he could have met
with the leaders of the military or the captains of industry and
instead he chose to meet with 230 teachers from across the United
States.''
   ``It was really a very breath-taking experience to sit there and
realize that this was happening and that he meant it,'' said Parets,
a past Delaware teacher of the year whose high school band will
march in the inaugural parade.
   Terry Weeks, the national teacher of the year from Murfreesboro,
Tenn., said, ``As a teacher I'd have to give him an A on his first
test. But also as a teacher we anxiously look forward to the coming
tests and to participation with him.''
   ``He's proven to us that he wasn't lip-synching, that the words
were his, that the feelings were his,'' said Weeks, a 7th grade
social studies teacher. ``What he can provide more than anything
else is kind of what he did today, become a national cheerleader for
educational improvement and then make sure that the local areas and
the states pitch in.''
   Betty Kraemer, a writing teacher from Bayville Elementary School
in Beachwood, N.J., said, ``I feel very proud, proud that he has
cared enough about education to bring us all together.''
   But Ms. Kraemer, a vice president of the New Jersey Education
Association, added, ``We didn't gain a whole lot under Ronald
Reagan, so we're a little skeptical _ but we're supportive of George
Bush.''

<HEAD>Ski Resorts Ordered to Inspect Lifts After Cracks Are Discovered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials have ordered nine ski resorts to
immediately inspect ski lifts after cracks were found in a chairlift.
   In an emergency session Tuesday, the Colorado Passenger Tramway
Safety Board gave the resorts one week to test up to 47 lifts for
cracks in a metal brace on chairs. The lifts will not have to be
dismantled and can be used in the meantime.
   Fractures were found in four chairs at Loveland Basin during
routine maintenance Saturday. The lift was immediately shut down.
Tramway board engineer John Carrick said the cracks resulted from
metal fatigue.
   ``You try to decide how excited to get about something like
this,'' he said. ``Faced with four broken chairs, I'm moderately
excited.''
   The chairs bear the trademark Yan and were designed by Lift
Engineering and Manufacturing of Nevada.
   ``It's not as if the chairs were on the verge of falling off,''
said Ken Abrahamson, mountain manager at Loveland. ``They weren't
dangling by a thread.''
   Ken Pearson, plant manager at Lift Engineering, said the company
is trying to find ways to reinforce the connection. ``We are asking
other ski areas if they too have this problem,'' he said. ``There
have been no real incidents.''

   Investigators believe the luggage
container in which the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 was
hidden was put on the jumbo jet in Frankfurt, West Germany, a
newspaper reported today.
   Police said Tuesday they had identified the luggage container,
but would not comment on whether it was placed on the flight in
Frankfurt or London.
   ``We have now identified the baggage container within the
aircraft in which the explosive device was placed, and substantial
forensic and reconstructive work is being undertaken in this
regard,'' said Detective Chief Superintendent John Orr, the Scottish
police officer heading the investigation.
   ``No details of the container, what else it held, where it was
discovered or where it originated were given officially but police
and accident investigators are now convinced that it was in luggage
first loaded at Frankfurt,'' the Times of London said today.
   Jochen Schroers, a spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's
office, said the report was ``purely speculative and premature'' and
that there was no evidence to support it.
   Police and Department of Transport spokesmen refused today to
elaborate on Orr's remarks or comment on The Times' report.
   The New York-bound flight originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing
727 and changed to a Boeing 747 at London's Heathrow airport,
transferring passengres and baggage. All 259 people on board and 11
on the ground in the Scottish town of Lockerbie were killed after
the jet exploded at 31,000 feet on Dec. 21.
   The Times said police think the bomb consisted of only a few
pounds of Czechoslovak-made Semtex plastic explosives.
   The paper said investigators think that once a hole was blown in
the side of the jet and the electronics bay _ its nerve center _
destroyed, the air pressure at the high altitude literally ripped
the jet apart.
   Investigators say the blast occurred in the cargo area just in
front of the left wing of the plane.
   Orr told a news conference that about 10,000 items of baggage and
other items from the plane have been recovered in searches
stretching across Scotland. He said Scottish police were working
with their counterparts in the United States and West Germany and
that more than 3,000 witness statements had been collated. He said
some investigations have been conducted in Scandinavia, but refused
to elaborate.
   Orr also refused to say which group, if any, police suspect of
carrying out the bombing. ``There has been a lot of comment, some
ill-informed, and I do not think it would be helpful to identify any
group,'' he said.
   Several terrorist groups are thought to have supplies of Semtex,
a powerful and hard-to-detect plastic explosive. British authorities
have said the bomb that destroyed Flight 103 was probably Semtex.

<TEXT>
   A new sentencing system that took effect in
November 1987 for people convicted of federal crimes is
constitutional, the Supreme Court ruled today in a decision that
will affect thousands.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices upheld the U.S. Sentencing
Commission's rules. The decision also upheld the validity of the
commission itself.
   Scores of federal trial judges have refused to use the new
sentencing rules, calling them and the commission unconstitutional.
Now, defendants sentenced by those judges must be resentenced.
   The decision carries no impact, however, for any defendant
sentenced in a state court.
   About 10,000 federal court defendants have been subjected to the
new sentencing system.
   The commission was created by Congress in the Sentencing Reform
Act of 1984, legislation aimed at eliminating what some called
unjustified disparities in sentences.
   The law empowers the commission, with seven members appointed to
six-year terms by the president, to tell federal judges what
sentences should be imposed for various crimes. Three of the
commission's members must be federal judges.
   The guidelines generally stiffened the prison time federal
convicts are required to serve. The commission eliminated parole and
curtailed credit for good behavior.
   Judges who had struck down the new sentencing system had ruled:
   _That Congress unlawfully avoided political accountability by
unconstitutionally delegating its legislative power to the
commission.
   _That the commission, because it includes members of the
judiciary and holds legislative power, violates the Constitution's
separation of powers principle.
   _That the new rules violate defendants' due-process rights by
curbing too severely judges' sentencing discretion.
   Writing for the court today, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said those
judges were wrong.
   ``Congess neither delegated excessive legislative power nor upset
the constitutionally mandated balance of powers among the coordinate
branches,'' Blackmun said.
   ``The Constitution's structural protections do not prohibit
Congress from delegating to an expert body located within the
judicial branch the intricate task of formulating sentencing
guidelines consistent with such significant statutory direction as
is present here,'' he said.
   In justifying judges' membership on the commission, Blackmun said
Congress is free to call on the judicial branch's help in ``a matter
uniquely within the ken of judges.''
   Only Justice Antonin Scalia dissented, on grounds that the
commission was given power not authorized by the Constitution.
   Sentencing Commission Chairman William W. Wilkins Jr., a judge on
the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., called
today's ruling ``one of the most important decisions handed down by
the court this decade.''
   Wilkins said the commission's guidelines ``are now the law of the
land, and the barriers to full implementation have been lifted.''
   The test case before the justices stemmed from the prosecution of
John M. Mistretta, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess and
distribute cocaine after his 1987 arrest in Kansas City, Mo.
   Before Mistretta's sentence was imposed, he challenged the new
sentencing rules. A trial judge dismissed the challenge and
sentenced Mistretta to 18 months in prison, to be followed by a
three-year term of supervised release.
   Today's decision upheld that sentence.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled that labor unions may not fire elected local union
officials who disagree with policies of the parent union.
   The 8-0 decision permits a union business representative in the
Los Angeles area to sue the Sheet Metal Workers' International
Association for his allegedly illegal firing.
   _ Unanimously struck down a tax in a West Virginia county that
permitting some property to be taxed at up to 35 times more than
neighboring comparable property.
   But the court, referring to the county tax as ``aberrational'',
declined to say whether similar state taxes also are
unconstitutional.
   The sentencing cases are Mistretta vs. U.S., 87-7028, and U.S.
vs. Mistretta, 87-1904.

   The Supreme Court ruled today that labor unions
may not fire elected local union officials who disagree with
policies of the parent union.
   The 8-0 decision permits a union business representative in the
Los Angeles area to sue the Sheet Metal Workers' International
Association for his allegedly illegal firing.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said firing an
elected official _ as opposed to an appointed one _ violates a 1959
federal law, the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.
   The law is designed ``to ensure that unions are democratically
governed and responsive to the will of the union membership as
expressed in open, periodic elections,'' Marshall said.
   Permitting an official to be fired for expressing dissenting
opinions would lead union members to conlude ``that one challenged
the union hierarchy, if at all, at one's peril,'' he said. ``That is
precisely what Congress sought to prevent when it passed'' the 1959
law.
   The ruling permits Edward Lynn, elected business representative
in 1981 of Local 75 of the Sheet Metal Workers union, to sue the
governing union international.
   Lynn and other members of the local became increasingly critical
of spending by the parent union and organized a dissident group that
successfully defeated proposals to raise the local's dues.
   The international union placed Local 75 in trusteeship in 1982
under the leadership of a regional official, Richard Hawkins.
   Hawkins proposed a new dues increase that again was defeated,
with Lynn leading the fight against the hike.
   Hawkins then filed charges against Lynn, and the union
international removed Lynn from office and fined him $2,500.
   Lynn filed a federal lawsuit in 1983 accusing union leaders of
firing him illegally and violating his free-speech rights.
   A federal judge threw out the suit. But the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reinstated it in 1987. The appeals court ruling was
upheld today by the Supreme Court.
   Marshall said today that Lynn's situation is different from a
case that resulted in a 1982 high court ruling. In that case, the
court upheld the firing of a union's appointed business agents by a
new union president who defeated the previous president in a union
election.
   The case acted on today is Sheet Metal Workers vs. Lynn, 86-1940.

   The Evening Journal, Martinsburg, W.Va., on the federal budget:
   Federal budget-making is the complex and often painful process of
sorting out national priorities. ...
   This year, to compound the difficulties inherent in this task,
these choices are now being made by two groups _ President Reagan's
departing band of officeholders and President-elect Bush's incoming
group of government managers. Like all new presidents, Bush must
live for a while with the budget he inherits from the departing
incumbent. ...
   Although the Bush transition team is working closely with the
Reagan administration on the fiscal 1990 budget, undoubtedly the new
president will want to establish his own priorities as soon as
possible. There well may be two budgets this year.
   Of course, what Congress finally comes up with in the way of
government spending generally bears little relationship to the
fiscal proposals coming from the White House and all the budgets
could wind up being exercises in futility.

   Scottsdale (Ariz.) Progress on the Supreme Court and abortion:
   The forces against abortion are elated. They smell victory in the
fight to overturn the 1973 decision which legalized abortion
nationwide, Roe vs. Wade.
   The cause of this elation is the Supreme Court's decision to
review Missouri's law regulating public financing of and
participation in abortions.
   The Missouri law prohibits abortions being performed in public
hospitals, requires viability tests for fetuses beyond the 19th week
and defines life as beginning at conception.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down all of these
provisions.
   Abortion opponents hope the Supreme Court will uphold at least
one of these points and be unable to reconcile it to Roe vs. Wade.
...
   No Supreme Court action, though, is going to stop abortion. It
will only move it back to the horrors of those back alleys.

   Starkville (Miss.) Daily News on the death of Emperor Hirihito:
   Many Americans old enough to remember the events of World War II
have mixed feelings about Japanese Emperor Hirohito. ...
   During the war, Hirohito images were everywhere in the United
States as symbols of Japanese aggression and cruelty.
   But, historians have now told us that the emperor, who had no
constitutional powers, fought privately to keep the country out of
war with America. He lost out to the warloards who ran the military.
...
   Japan has become one of our strongest allies, and it's partly
because this country, even while conquering the Japanese, recognized
how important the emperor was to them.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on federal pay increases:
   Every now and then, we wish history would repeat itself. Case in
point: On Jan. 20, 115 years ago, Congress repealed the ``Salary
Grab'' Act of 1873. That act had increased members' salaries by 50
percent. It had to be repealed because of public outrage.
   Today, Congress is quietly on the verge of allowing itself
another 50 percent pay increase that will add $128 million to a
federal budget already bloody with red ink _ this for men and women
who already earn more than 98 percent of our country's workers.
   We've heard some moaning and grumbling. But is the public
outraged enough to demand Congress to put an end to this blatant
salary grab?
   Our ancestors taught us we don't have to put up with such
shameless antics. They did something. Will we?

   The Miami Herald on William Bennett as drug czar:
   What did Congress intend when it created the Cabinet-level
position of Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy?
   Many members and non-political drug experts had hoped for an
experienced team builder who could bring law enforcement and the
military together with business leaders, educators, rehabilitation
experts and public health authorities to forge a coherent attack on
both the supply and the demand side of the drug problem.
   Instead of such a leader, however, (President-elect) Bush has
designated the fiery former Education Secretary, William J. Bennett.
...
   Bennett made his reputation as a rhetorical flame-thrower. ...
   To win Senate approval and to succeed as the nation's first drug

need for tougher action on drugs. ...
   For all Bennett's uncompromising words, no dramatic change in
public education occurred under his leadership. ...
   In many areas, the job of remedial education has been turned over
to the colleges, a task suffocating higher education.
   Let us hope Bennett learned from his failings in the Department
of Education. The country needs answers and action on addiction.

   Ted Bundy's death warrant for murdering
a girl was signed minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his
appeal, and the mayor of the slain child's town said the execution
would prompt celebrations.
   In signing the warrant, Gov. Bob Martinez set the execution for
Jan. 24 for the 1978 rape and murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Diane
Leach, who was abducted in Lake City and was found dead in a pig sty.
   It was the fourth time the 42-year-old former law student has
been scheduled to die in Florida's electric chair. Bundy, whose case
was depicted in the television miniseries ``The Deliberate
Stranger,'' has come within hours of being executed only to win
postponement.
   His attorneys said after Tuesday's 7-2 high court decision they
would pursue further appeals. There also were reports today that
Bundy might offer information about other killings in an attempt to
delay his execution.
   Bundy also has also been sentenced to death for killing two women
in a Florida State University sorority house in Tallahassee three
weeks before Kimberly's murder. He has been linked to up to 36 sex
murders or disappearances of young women, most in Utah, Colorado and
Washington state.
   ``Justice has been on hold for a decade, and it's about time Ted
Bundy paid for his crimes,'' Martinez said. ``I have a strong
feeling on Tuesday of next week, the state will be able to carry out
its duty.''
   ``There'll be a celebration when he dies,'' said Gerald Witt,
mayor of Lake City, a rural town of 11,000 people near the Georgia
border. ``He has such a terrible criminal record. It's just
impossible to have any sympathy for him.''
   In Utah, Salt Lake County authorities believe Bundy was
responsible for the disappearances of five teen-age girls and think
he may have been involved in that of a young woman. Sheriff Pete
Hayward said Tuesday that investigators would travel to Florida this
weekend to question Bundy, perhaps for one last time.
   In western Washington state, Bundy is the prime suspect in the
1974 slayings of eight young women, whose murders remain unsolved.
   ``I can't believe it's finally going to come to an end,'' said
Eleanore Rose, whose daughter, Denise Naslund, was one of the eight.
``They keep giving him appeal after appeal after appeal. Now that it
(the execution) may happen, I'm in a kind of shock.
   ``It's not going to bring Denise back. All of us who lost
daughters, we're still going to have all those unanswered
questions,'' Ms. Rose said. She said she had hoped Bundy would
confess to the slayings ``to put our minds at ease.''
   State Attorney Jerry Blair, who prosecuted Bundy in the Leach
case, said there's ``a move underfoot to delay his execution on
grounds that he's ready to come clean and tell everything he knows.''
   ``As far as I'm concerned, he'd have to talk between now and
Tuesday,'' Blair added. ``Bundy has been on death row for over 10
years, and I would have to view any offer to talk now as a
continuing effort to buy time.''
   In addition, a prison spokesman said today that Bundy had changed
his mind about talking to journalists.
   Bob Macmaster, a spokesman for the state Department of
Corrections, said Bundy agreed to hold an hour-long group interview
Monday afternoon, followed by a one-hour interview with a single
newspaper or broadcast station that Bundy will pick.
   In the appeal rejected Tuesday, Bundy's attorneys argued that
lower courts wrongly determined in retrospect that Bundy had been
competent to stand trial in 1980 for Kimberly's slaying.
   A federal judge in 1986 ruled that Bundy had been competent in
1980, calling him ``the most competent serial killer in the country
at this time ... a diabolical genius.'' The 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta upheld the judge's ruling.
   The appeal said the Supreme Court ``has never addressed the issue
of when, if ever, a (post-trial) hearing would be adequate to remedy
a violation of a defendant's right ... to a contemporary
determination of his competency when sufficient (indications) arise
at trial.''
   The high court in 1966 said defendants have a right to such a
``contemporary'' competency hearing.
   Bundy's attorney James Coleman Jr., said he planned to file a new
emergency appeal in a Florida state court, but refused to disclose
what legal arguments would be used.

   Los Angeles Times on William Bennett as drug czar:
   President-Elect George Bush made a poor choice in naming William
J. Bennett, the abrasive former secretary of education, to head the
new Office of National Drug Control Policy. ...
   The head of any anti-drug campaign must be prepared to handle
often-sensitive negotiations with countries that produce or ship
illegal drugs. ... And the drug czar must also help soothe internal
rivalries between such independent government agencies as the FBI
and the Coast Guard.
   That is reason enough, it seems, to have avoided
shoot-from-the-lip candidates like Bennett or U.S. Customs
Commissioner William von Raab, whose outbursts against Mexico have
angered officials in that country. ...
   Now that the choice is made, Bennett should pay heed to the
requirements of the legislation that created his new job. ...
   We are convinced that a calm and honest assessment of the
nation's war on drugs will find that attempts to halt drug
trafficking in source countries and at our borders ... do not work
as well as education and treatment programs that eliminate the
demand for illegal drugs in this country.

   The Times Leader, Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on the federal budget:
   Unless George Bush can find a more effective way to spend the
nation's money in fiscal 1990 than President Reagan would, the
president-elect's promise of a ``kinder, gentler America'' could
turn out to be nothing more than an empty campaign slogan.
   Reagan's $1.15 trillion spending plan for next year would be
anything but kind and gentle to many Americans. ... To the contrary,
it would hit them extremely hard.
   Doctors, veterans, boat owners, air travelers, federal retirees,
children who eat subsidized lunches at school _ as well as people in
scores of other categories nationwide _ would feel the crunch. ...
   One of government's primary responsibilities is providing for a
strong national defense. Being stuck in a militarily vulnerable
position could spell our doom faster than anything else.
   At the same time, though, government also has a duty to care for
its people _ who, after all, are the government.
   After taking office, Bush obviously will need to wrestle with
that dilemma, which seems to boil down to deciding which is more
important: more guns and less butter, or vice-versa.

   The Evening Sun, Baltimore, on the Palestinian uprising:
   Since the beginning of the Palestinian uprising, called the
intifadah, 13 months ago, leaders of the Israeli Defense Forces have
been troubled with the role the political leaders have thrust upon
them.
   The politicians talk tough, but it is young soldiers who fire the
bullets which have killed 359 people. ...
   Riot control is not a normal military function, and this
undoubtedly accounts for the high death rate in Israel while
comparable uprisings in Korea and the Philippines resulted in few
deaths.
   This week Israeli troops took the unprecedented step of ordering
small midnight burials for intifadah victims, since their funerals
have often produced more confrontation and death. Such steps cast
the IDF in an opprobrious role.

   The News-Review, Roseburg, Ore., on human rights in the Soviet
Union:
   The Soviet Union, arguably the most systematic violator of human
rights after Nazi Germany, wants to hold a conference on human
rights in Moscow in 1991. ...
   To Mikhail Gorbachev, it is a crucial step in his campaign to
halt abuses of the past.
   Gorbachev is pushing the conference for two apparent reasons: He
wants to remove the stigma of the Stalinist terror from the Soviet
Union's image. He appears to want to grant some, but not all, human
rights to his country.
   Gorbachev has made significant human rights progress in a short
time. In the past year, many Soviet prisoners of dissent have been
released. ...The doors of emigration have opened for 100 Jewish
refuseniks long denied visas. Some 60,000 Soviet Jews and Armenians

assisting victims of abuse, not merely from a physician's treatment
perspective but, perhaps more importantly, looking at the cause and
prevention of family violence by integrating the efforts of others,

   El Paso (Texas) Times on trends in smoking habits:
   It's been 25 years since former Surgeon General Luther Terry
first told Americans that smoking was bad for their health.
   Since then, the percentage of smokers has declined, particularly
among men and the better educated.
   What does this tell us?
   First that the vast efforts to educate the U.S. public about the
dangers of smoking has helped. In particular, Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop has waged a battle against smoking. ...
   But the second development, one that Koop also supports, is that
smoking simply isn't ``in'' anymore. It is social pressure that has
stopped some people smoking and has kept some from starting.
   As Koop said to The Associated Press: ``This is not a prohibitive
society. We're not going to tell people they can't smoke. We learned
that we can't tell people they can't drink.''
   Yet programs such as Mothers Against Drunk Drivers have helped
alleviate that serious problem. So has Koop's educational battle
against smoking.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on insurance for bank and thrift
deposits:
   In its final report, President Reagan's Council of Economic
Advisers made an interesting recommendation: lower the ceiling on
federally insured deposits in banks and thrift institutions.
   Deposit insurance is a Depression-era idea that once made sense.
It discouraged runs on banks and gave small savers a safe place for
their money. Recently, however, it contributed to a national crap
shoot that may cost the public $100 billion.
   In 1980, Congress unwisely raised the insurance limit to $100,000
from $40,000. Thus a device designed to protect mom and pop
depositors became a no-lose game for the wealthy, who could put a
no-risk $100,000 in one bank _ or $1 million in 10 banks.
   Because of go-go banking, money brokers, lax regulation and
deposit insurance, the taxpayers are about to take a huge hit to
rescue the thrift industry. The way to protect themselves from a
future hit is to stop guaranteeing other people's unwise investments.

   The News Tribune, Woodbridge, N.J., on federal pollution controls:
   Because all four air-quality regions of the state have
unacceptable levels of ozone, the federal government forced the
state to require major gas stations to install pump nozzles designed
to retrieve gasoline vapors.
   There is a better way. If Congress acknowledged that controlling
air pollution is indeed a national task, it would require automobile
manufacturers to equip new cars with special canisters that would
provide the same result. Vapors would be directed toward the
gasoline tank through a system that would cost an estimated $15 to
$35 per car.
   Under the present rules, only areas that fail ozone tests _ such
as Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Long Island and New Jersey _ are
forced to act. But hydrocarbons let loose in wide-open Wyoming and
rural Pennsylvania are just as unhealthy ... and all contribute to
the so-called ``greenhouse'' effect.
   By not acting on a national level, Congress is bowing to its
friends in the automobile business while giving a
less-than-sufficient response to ozone pollution.

Mylar balloons can have a disastrous effect on wildlife.
   In 1985, a young sperm whale munching on a school of squid
accidentally swallowed a deflated Mylar balloon. The balloon blocked
the whale's intestines and it contracted food poisoning.
   Dead and dying hawksbill sea turtles and loggerhead turtles, both
endangered species, have been found with latex balloons in their
intestines.
   Balloons are wondrous playthings, but massive balloon launches
are wasteful and destructive. Teachers would not approve of dumping
30 message-filled bottles in a stream just to see where they go;
neither should they encourage students to loose message-filled
balloons into the air.

   Panasonic Co., accused of bilking consumers out
of millions of dollars in a price-fixing scheme, has agreed to
return up to $16 million to buyers nationwide, state Attorney
General Robert Abrams said today.
   Abrams accused the company of coercing retailers into charging
full list prices for its products by threatening to stop supplying
stores that sold Panasonic equipment below the suggested retail
price.
   The company denied any wrongdoing but agreed to make refunds ``to
avoid disruption to its dealers and to the conduct of its
business,'' according to papers filed with the U.S. District Court
in Manhattan.
   Abrams said the alleged scheme involved a number of popular
products sold under the Panasonic and Technics labels, including
videocassette recorders, videotape cameras, telephones and answering
machines.
   The company allegedly began the scheme in March 1988 and ended it
about six months later when it learned Abrams' office had begun an
investigation, the attorney general said.
   Under the agreement, he said, Panasonic will notify consumers who
bought its products during that period that they are eligible for
refunds. Abrams said refunds will be available to about 665,000
people nationwide.
   Panasonic also agreed to notify all of its retailers of their
right to set their own prices, and to spend $2 million administering
the settlement, Abrams said.

   A basketball referee was attacked and

from an adult league game, a city recreation official said.
   Bob Wunderlich, who was attacked Monday night, was examined at a

their division, were behind.
   Wunderlich told authorities he ejected a Pistons player for

behind. Other players and spectators joined the melee, he said.
   Members of Grasshopper Power tried to protect him, the referee
said.
   By the time police arrived, the fight had ended and those
involved had left. The game was stopped with 90 seconds left and
Grasshopper Power leading 72-52.
   The Pistons were suspended from the league pending an
investigation, and the players responsible for the brawl will be
banned, Green said.
   ``Even if you had the worst referee in the world you don't do

   HUD Secretary-designate Jack Kemp told big-city
mayors today he would be an activist and advocate for solving
housing and other urban problems, calling himself ``a big-L
liberal'' on urban issues.
   Kemp, addressing the U.S. Conference of Mayors, cited the
problems posed by federal budget constraints but spoke
enthusiastically about working with mayors, whose complaints about
cuts in federal aid to cities have been a constant refrain.
   ``I'm going to throw the labels out. We're going to throw out
ideology,'' said the former New York Republican congressman chosen
by President-elect Bush to head the Department of Housing and urban
Development.
   ``I am going to be an activist. I'm going to be an advocate. The
door is open. My mind is open.''
   Kemp, a conservative who unsuccessfully sought the Republican
presidential nomination, drew applause from the mayors when he
described himself as ``a bleeding heart conservative'' and ``a
progressive conservative.''
   He added, ``I want to be considered a big-L liberal'' on race,
poverty, and relations between mayors and HUD.
   Kemp listened as mayors described problems in their cities caused
by a shortage of affordable housing and cuts in federal housing aid
and other programs.
   He noted that he has been associated with tax reform but said
``it went too far when it comes to affordable, low- and moderate
income housing.''
   He added: ``I'm speaking for Kemp now, I'm not speaking for the
administration.''
   The conference on Tuesday released a survey showing increased
hunger and homelessness in mayor U.S. cities, particularly among
families and children.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., the new chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, called the findings ``a devastating indictment of the
neglect of the needs of our major urban centers.''
   He said the mayors make a ``compelling case'' for more federal
assistance to help the homeless problem. ``devastating indictment''
of the neglect of urban America.
   Sasser said President Reagan's budget proposal for fiscal 1990
virtually ignores the problem of urban homelessness and that
Congress will expect a revised proposal from the new administration.
   ``Families _ women and children _ they make up the most
significant increase we have experienced'' in homelessness, Boston
Mayor Raymond Flynn said in releasing the findings.
   Flynn said the rate of increase in hunger and homelessness seemed
to slow from the previous year. He attributed that in part to
increased emergency services provided by state and local governments.
   Officials in every city surveyed cited the lack of affordable
housing as the main cause of homelessness. Flynn cited the decline
in federal spending on low-income housing during the Reagan
administration.
   ``Shelters are not the answer,'' Flynn said. ``Permanent,
affordable housing _ that is the answer.''
   Among the survey's findings were that in the last year in the 27
surveyed cities:
   _Requests for emergency shelter increased an average 13 percent.
All but two of the cities reported an increase. The rate of increase
had been 18 percent in a similar survey a year ago.
   _Requests for emergency food were up in nine of 10 cities, by an
average 19 percent. Three-fifths of those asking for emergency food
were members of families.
   _An average 19 percent of the requests for emergency shelter went
unmet; among homeless families, 23 percent of requests were unmet.
Shelters in two out of three cities reported they turn away homeless
families because of a lack of resources.
   _In 62 percent of the cities, emergency food assistance
facilities had to turn away people because of lack of resources.
   _On average the composition of the homeless population was 49
percent single men, 34 percent members of families, 13 percent
single women and 5 percent unaccompanied youth. One in four was a
child. An average 34 percent of homeless were substance abusers and
one-fourth were severely mentally ill; 23 percent had full-time or
part-time jobs; 26 percent were veterans.
   The survey was conducted in 27 cities whose mayors sit on the
conference's task force on hunger and homelessness. They were:
Boston; Denver; Louisville, Ky.; San Juan, P.R.; San Francisco; New
Orleans; Kansas City, Mo.; Nashville, Tenn.; Los Angeles; San
Antonio, Texas; Portland, Ore.; Salt Lake City; Minneapolis;
Phoenix; Philadelphia; Trenton, N.J.; New York; St. Paul, Minn.;
Norfolk, Va.; San Diego; Providence, R.I.; Hartford, Conn.;
Charleston, S.C.; Seattle; Chicago; Cleveland; and Detroit.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha suffered a
mild stroke today and was admitted to a military hospital. His
office said he was ``clear-minded'' and might appoint a temporary
replacement.
   Officials said Botha, who turned 73 last week, was in stable
condition at No. 2 Military Hospital in the Cape Town suburb of
Wynberg. His office said no further medical statements would be
issued for the time being unless the president's condition worsened.
   Botha has for the most part enjoyed excellent health since he
took charge of South Africa's white-controlled government as prime
minister in 1978. Under a new constitution, he became president in
1984.
   The modern, five-story hospital in Wynberg, part of a military
base, is considered one of the best in southern Africa. Botha laid
the cornerstone for the main building in 1976, when he was defense
minister.
   The president's wife for 46 years, Elize, and some of their five
children came to the hospital to be with her husband, the state
radio said.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said Botha
suffered the stroke early in the morning while at his home.
   Botha's office said the president remained in charge of the
country ``along with the rest of the Cabinet.'' Botha's staff
initially said the Cabinet would meet to consider naming an acting
president, but later his office said Botha was ``quite
clear-minded'' and was likely to make the appointment himself on
Thursday.
   According to South Africa's Constitution, the president can
appoint a Cabinet minister to fill in for him temporarily. If the
president is incapacitated, the Cabinet can elect one of its members
as acting president.
   Caspar Venter, a Bureau for Information official, said any of
several senior Cabinet ministers could be designated to fill in for
the president in the event of his absence from the country or his
incapacitation.
   Botha has refused to comment about when he might step down from
the presidency. There has been intense speculation, but no
consensus, about which Cabinet member might be selected by the
National Party as Botha's successor.
   Among those mentioned as possible successors are Foreign Affairs
Minister Pik Botha, who is not related to the president; National
Education Minister F.W. de Klerk; Constitutional Development
Minister Chris Heunis; and Defense Minister Magnus Malan.
   During his years in power, Botha has maintained the National
Party's political dominance despite harsh criticism both from the
anti-apartheid movement and from extreme-right whites.
   He has presided over the first significant racial reforms
undertaken during the National Party's 40-year rule, such as
legalization of interracial marriages and abolition of pass laws,
which restricted blacks' movements.
   But he has refused to negotiate with the African National
Congress, the main guerrilla movement fighting the government, or to
release the ANC's jailed leader, Nelson Mandela.
   Botha has refused to discuss the possibility of a one-person,
one-vote system in South Africa, where the 5 million whites control
the government and economy while the 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs.
   The Wynberg hospital is about a mile from the Constantiaberg
Clinic, where Mandela spent several weeks recuperating from
tuberculosis last year before being transferred to a staff home at a
prison farm in the town of Paarl.

   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday called for
prayers for Christian unity to mark the 30th anniversary of the
Second Vatican Council.
   In remarks to his weekly general audience, John Paul said
divisions among Christians were ``contrary to the will of the Lord.''
   He said he would go to the Basilica of St. Paul's Outside the
Walls on Jan. 25 to recall the Jan. 25, 1959, announcement by Pope
John XXIII of an ecumenical council for the church.
   The council, called the Second Vatican Council, was opened by
Pope John in 1962 and paved the way for the Roman Catholic Church's
efforts to improve relations with other Christian denominations.

   Environmental groups warned people to stay
indoors Wednesday because of dangerous smog levels, but government
officials said there was no need for concern.
   ``There is no reason to worry. We are watching the pollution
levels and we will inform the public responsibly if there is a
problem,'' Deputy Environment Minister Giorgos Ktenas said.
   The state-run Program for Pollution Control said smog readings
were ``moderately'' above dangerous levels.
   The Panhellenic Center for Ecological Studies, a private
monitoring group, disputed that and said 386 people were
hospitalized with smog-related breathing and cardiac problems.
   Smog has become a major problem in Athens, home to almost
one-third of Greece's population of 9.8 million. Cars, diesel taxis
and the city's aging buses are blamed for most of the pollution.

<TEXT>
   The United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization will hold an international
conference here next year on ways to reduce illiteracy, a U.N.
official announced Wednesday.
   UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor Zaragoza said the
seven-day gathering will dramatize the plight of 1 billion people
worldwide who cannot read or write.
   ``We're in a very good moment in contemporary history'' to try to
wipe out illiteracy by the end of the century, he said.'s goals. Sununu
will be
Bush's White House chief of staff.
   ``This is my very first event on the inaugural calendar.
...That's the way I wanted it, meeting with educators,'' he said.
``I know you've heard me say during this campaign that I intended to
be the education president. Two days before I begin trying I wanted
you to know that I meant it.
   ``The country is now wide awake to the central role of our
schools in determining the future health of our society,'' he said.
   Even under budgetary constraints, Bush said, ``we're going to
work to make sure that the nation does what needs to be done for our
schools: reward excellence, raise standards, expand choice,
publicize success, strive to resolve shortcomings and keep American
attention and effort concentrated on further education reform and
improvement.''
   Bush said repeatedly during the campaign that he wanted to be
``the education president.'' He has promised to convene an education
summit of governors, university presidents and other leading
educators early in his administration.
   Cavazos told the teachers the Bush administration's new $500
million ``merit schools'' program will place particular emphasis on
reducing dropout rates. The program will provide recognition and
financial rewards ``to schools that are accountable and work,'' said
Cavazos.
   They will be rated on standards defined by the state ``with some
federal guidance,'' he said, on such measures as test scores,
college participation rates, employment of graduates and ``success
in improving school participation and performance of the
disadvantaged and the handicapped.''
   Paul Parets, a band teacher at Alexias I. DuPont High School in
Wilmington, Del., said, ``I was very moved. I sat there thinking he
could have met with the heads of foreign states, he could have met
with the leaders of the military or the captains of industry and
instead he chose to meet with 230 teachers from across the United
States.''
   ``It was really a very breath-taking experience to sit there and
realize that this was happening and that he meant it,'' said Parets,
a past Delaware teacher of the year whose high school band will
march in the inaugural parade.
   Terry Weeks, the national teacher of the year from Murfreesboro,
Tenn., said, ``As a teacher I'd have to give him an A on his first
test. But also as a teacher we anxiously look forward to the coming
tests and to participation with him.''
   ``He's proven to us that he wasn't lip-synching, that the words
were his, that the feelings were his,'' said Weeks, a 7th grade
social studies teacher. ``What he can provide more than anything
else is kind of what he did today, become a national cheerleader for
educational improvement and then make sure that the local areas and
the states pitch in.''
   Betty Kraemer, a writing teacher from Bayville Elementary School
in Beachwood, N.J., said, ``I feel very proud, proud that he has
cared enough about education to bring us all together.''
   But Ms. Kraemer, a vice president of the New Jersey Education
Association, added, ``We didn't gain a whole lot under Ronald
Reagan, so we're a little skeptical _ but we're supportive of George
Bush.''

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said today they have
opened a criminal investigation into I.B.I. Engineering, a company
U.S. officials accused of helping build a suspected Libyan chemical
weapons plant.
   In Bonn, opposition lawmakers shouted and hooted during a
parliamentary session in which the government again altered its
official position on when it knew about the suspect plant, which
Libya claims will produce pharmaceuticals.
   Besides the I.B.I. Engineering probe, federal officials are
investigating overall West German involvement, and a local
prosecutor in the southern city of Offenburg is investigating the
Imhausen-Chemie company. U.S. officials allege Imhausen also was a
major participant in the Libyan project.
   West Germany's ARD television estimated that 50 companies in the
Frankfurt area alone had a role in building the Libyan plant.
   ``Our authorities opened the probe against I.B.I. on Friday
because of suspicion of reported violations of export laws,''
Frankfurt prosecutor Jochen Schroers told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview today. He did not say why the investigation was
not announced earlier.
   Schroers refused to provide further information about the
investigation of the now-defunct company owned by Iraqi businessman
Ihsan Barbouti, who reportedly coordinated the Libyan plant
construction.
   I.B.I. allegedly provided the contracts to the West German
companies.
   Earlier today in Munich, prosecutors said they have begun a
criminal investigation of a Bavarian firm that a news magazine says
helped Libya develop the ability for in-flight refueling of
warplanes.
   Munich Prosecutor Heinz Stocker said the Intec Technical Trade
and Logistic company was suspected of violating West Germany's
export laws.
   He said the probe was focusing on whether ``(fuel) tank equipment
sent to Libya required an export permit.''
   Government officials have said some West German companies with
connections to the Libyan plant may have been unwitting
participants. Three more companies were added to the growing list
Tuesday.
   In Parliament, Wolfgang Schaeuble, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief
of staff, said today that ``on the basis of intelligence reports, we
must assume that this plant in Rabta is intended to produce chemical
weapons.''
   On Tuesday, chief government spokesman Friedhelm Ost refused to
say whether Bonn had evidence backing charges the plant was built to
produce such weapons.
   Schaeuble said the American Embassy in Bonn informed West German
officials May 18 about possible German involvement in the plant.
That's five months earlier than what the government acknowledged
Monday, and six months earlier than the Nov. 15 date West German
leaders mentioned three weeks ago.
   Israeli leaders criticized German involvement in the Libyan
complex, pointing out that Libya is one of Israel's most dangerous
enemies.
   Israeli Finance Minister Shimon Peres was expected to take up the
matter with Chancellor Helmut Kohl when he begins a four-day visit
to Bonn today.
   The Merck chemical company on Tuesday notified government
officials it had shipped 19 tons of a chemical solvent to Libya last
year, adding that the destination may have been the suspected poison
gas plant in Rabta.
   Merck has regular business dealings with Libya, most involving
small deliveries of chemicals and medicines to hospitals and
universities, said company spokesman Hans-Joachim Schmitt.
   On the same day, Helmut Barmann, head of the local branch of the
Rhenus transportation company in Cologne, said his firm had entered
into contracts with I.B.I. in 1986, 1987 and 1988 to deliver
materials to Libya.
   ``Construction materials and, in one case, chemicals were
involved,'' Barmann told the AP in a telephone interview.
   Barmann declined to provide further details, adding that federal
customs officials had seized the company's records as part of the
Libyan probe.
   Other West German companies reportedly involved include the
Salzgitter Industriebau company, which according to Stern magazine
made the plans for the facility 60 miles south of Tripoli.
Salzgitter Industriebau, which is fully-owned by the West German
government, has denied participation.
   Also Tuesday, the Alfred Teves company of Frankfurt told the AP
that it had supplied $2.8 million worth of ventilation equipment to
I.B.I. in 1986.
   Spokesman Gerd Sinreich said the company believed the material
was to be used for a pharmaceutical plant in Hong Kong. Stern
magazine says the Hong Kong plant was built to disguise West German
involvement in the Libyan facility.

   Don Hodel is going skiing. Ann McLaughlin is
going back to school. George Shultz is going to have to get a
driver's license.
   As Ronald Reagan's presidency comes to an end, so do the heady
times atop Washington's power structure for many members of his
Cabinet and other ranking officials of the administration.
   Some are staying on with President-elect Bush, including
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, and administration veteran James Baker III, who will be the
new secretary of state.
   But for some of the others, January has meant packing boxes,
selling homes and deciding what to do next. In some cases, what's
next may be a fat salary and a job with a big law firm or
corporation. Or it may mean taking it easy.
   Secretary of State George Shultz and his wife Helena have sold
their house in Bethesda, Md., and booked a commercial flight back
home to California on Inauguration Day.
   Shultz plans to write his memoirs and consider what else to do.
He has a standing offer to return to teaching at Stanford
University, but he appears to have left behind the corporate world,
where he earned $1 million a year as an executive of Bechtel Corp.
   But first things first. After 6{ years of being chauffeured and
accompanied by security agents, and not driving a car once, Shultz
plans to take the California driver's test to obtain a new license.
   He will keep a bodyguard for at least a month after leaving
Washington.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., the
only member of Reagan's original Cabinet to last all eight years,
plans to return to New York, where he has kept a home two blocks off
Central Park. At age 66, he'll return to practicing law, although he
says he may not return to the firm he left in 1981.
   ``I've been in Washington three times,'' Pierce said. ``I served
under three separate presidents. And each time I always do the same
thing _ I go back to New York and practice law and join a bunch of
boards of companies.''
   Donald P. Hodel, secretary of interior, is going to think about
what to do next while spending the remainder of the winter skiing in
Colorado.
   ``I'm going to have to get serious about earning a living,''
Hodel said. ``And I really at this point don't have any idea.''
   He's sold his Washington home and has bought one west of Denver.
He's also bought a season ski pass for four big ski areas there.
   ``I think I'll make a better decision about what I should do and
what I should be in the future after a little of that,'' he said.
   Ann D. McLaughlin, secretary of labor for little more than a
year, will resume studies at the Wharton School of Business, where
she was studying when Reagan asked her to join the Cabinet. She had
worked at the treasury and interior departments earlier in the
administration.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng says he'll sleep in on the
day after the inauguration _ and maybe the next day, too.
   ``I intend to take it easier,'' he said. ``I've reached that age
(70) when I don't have to worry about justifying myself every day,
so I'm not going to worry about that.''
   He came to Washington from California 20 years ago when Richard
Nixon named him an assistant secretary of agriculture. He plans to
remain, but is considering buying a second home in California.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen, also 70, has
put his condominium on the market. He plans to retire to rural
Indiana, where he was a doctor, and spend his time reading, writing
and tending to his five acres.
   His first priority is getting tomato seedlings going in his
greenhouse in time for spring transplanting. He's bought a riding
lawnmower and recently installed a hot tub in the greenhouse, for
relaxing after all that work.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington plans to return to San Francisco
and his real estate investments. He's considering job prospects, and
he seems to be in a hurry to get started. He's booked on a plane out
Thursday night, the evening before Inauguration Day.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity, 71, who has been in the job
just 14 months, will return to his home in Beaufort, S.C. His
agenda: fishing, hunting, golf, tennis and sailing.
   Frank Carclucci, the Defense Department secretary, says he'd like
to find a job outside government and remain in Washington.
   ``I've given thought to it but I haven't decided anything,'' he
said. ``It's a little hard from this perch to look around for jobs.
Every time somebody calls me on the phone, I have to disqualify
myself.''
   Charles Z. Wick, head of the U.S. Information Agency and a close
friend of the Reagans, will return to Los Angeles with his wife Mary
Jane.
   Wick, a former band leader whose name originally was Zwick, plans
to resume doing what he was doing before Reagan's election _
arranging financing for movies and other show business deals. A son,
Douglas Wick, produced the hit movie ``Working Girl.''

<TEXT>
   The government, under Israeli attack over a Foreign
Office minister's meeting with Yasser Arafat, is trying to convey
the message that it is not tilting away from Israel to the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The British government is stressing that it does not recognize
the PLO as the Palestinians' sole representative, does not support
the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and has no plans
for Arafat to meet Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Newspaper accounts, as well as a government source, drew a
picture of a prime minister who wants to leave Middle East
peacemaking to the Americans and appear neutral without seeming to
go up against a minister in her own government.
   Britain was criticized sharply by Israel this week over a meeting
in Tunis between Arafat and William Waldegrave, a junior Foreign
Office minister, and the remarks Waldegrave made during and after
the meeting.
   The Israelis were particularly incensed to hear Waldegrave
suggesting that Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel
both were ex-terrorists.
   Waldegrave warned Israel against ``clever-silly'' responses to
Arafat's new peacemaking posture, and said that if Israel failed to
grasp the initiative it would be ``left behind.''
   The tabloid Sun denounced Waldegrave's ``insulting attitude
toward Israel'' and the Evening Standard ran a cartoon showing
British dignitaries from the archbishop of Canterbury downward
lining up to embrace Arafat.
   Greville Janner, a veteran pro-Israel lawmaker, accused
Waldegrave of ``publicly lecturing and tactlessly attacking Israel's
democratically elected leaders while sitting beside a man who until
recently was responsible for a series of savage terrorist attacks on
Israel's people.''
   But other papers generally backed Waldegrave, and Janner,
speaking in a parliamentary debate on the Middle East on Tuesday
night, was a lone voice. Members of the governing Conservative Party
as well as opposition Laborites rallied around Waldegrave, and Mrs.
Thatcher pointedly sat beside him through the debate.
   As a member of Parliament Mrs. Thatcher represents Finchley, a
London constituency with a large Jewish population, and is known to
harbor strong personal affection for Israel.
   But she already has disagreed with Israel on the PLO's recent
decision to recognize Israel and disavow terrorism, believing it is
an opportunity Jerusalem should seize.
   During the parliamentary debate, her contributions were guarded.
She said she wanted both sides to sit down to peaceful negotiations,
but cautioned that it would take a long time and that ``nothing
could be started before the new administration in the United States
is well in position and has decided precisely what is its policy.''
   The Times of London said Tuesday that Mrs. Thatcher was trying to
avert a clash with Shamir and prevent the Tunis meeting, the
highest-level British-PLO encounter so far, from raising further
diplomatic heat.
   On Wednesday, a government source speaking on condition of
anonymity indicated that the government did not want to carry
Waldegrave's remarks further, and that the aim was now to ``pour oil
on these troubled waters.''
   The source insisted there was no change in Britain's policy of
not recognizing the PLO as the Palestinians' sole representative,
and its wish for Palestinian national aspirations to be met in a
confederation with Jordan, rather than through an independent state.
The source also said Mrs. Thatcher, who has invited Shamir to
London, had no plans to meet with Arafat.
   The British are keen to knock down any notion that they are

   A disabled athlete rolled away from City Hall
in his wheelchair Tuesday, embarking on 5,000-mile, 20-state trek to
raise money for paralysis research.
   ``I want people to realize that living with a disability does not
limit one's ability to live life to the fullest,'' said Bill Duff,
26, a Houston native who was paralyzed from the waist down in a car
accident seven years ago.
   As a Dixieland band played, four motorcycle officers escorted
Duff as he headed out of the city on a trip that he hopes will wind
up in New York in July.
   Dozens of corporations have helped fund Duff's Wheels Across
America journey. Project organizers hope he will inspire
contributions to the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, a program
sponsored by the University of Miami.

<HEAD>Chicago Company Signs Consent Decree on Water-Filter Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chicago company has agreed not to contend in
ads that its water treatment system removes certain chemicals unless
it can back up what it says, the Federal Trade Commission said
Wednesday.
   The company, Associated Mills Inc., signed a proposed consent
decree that also requires it not to claim without substantiation
that the membrane cartridge of its Pollenex Bottled Water Maker
Reverse Osmosis System can last a year without replacement.
   The commission's complaint said the company had contended in
advertising that its system removed ``up to 99 percent of organic
chemicals and other contaminants from tap water,'' and nearly all or
most of the family of chemicals called trihalomethanes, which can be
produced by chlorination.
   However, the company had no basis for that claim, the FTC said.
   Under the decree, Associated must have a ``reasonable basis'' for
any claims of performance or longevity of its water treatment
products.
   By signing the decree, Associated neither admitted nor denied
guilt. However, it will make itself liable for a fine of $10,000 if
it should be found to have violated any terms in the future, if the
decree is adopted.
   The commission will receive public comment on the decree until
March 20, after which it will decide whether to adopt it.

   Security guards, baffled for
eight days by false alarms at Twin Rivers Elementary School, have
found the culprit: a teddy bear.
   Principal Paul Phipps said the mystery was solved when a
maintenance worker smacked his hand down on a ladder in frustration.
The teddy bear replied with a beep.
   The bear, a learning tool for special needs children, responds
with a beep to touch, movement or sound, Phipps said.
   Someone had left the bear on a heat register. Every time the
hot-water heater clanked at night, the bear beeped, triggering a
silent alarm repeatedly over the winter holidays.
   ``All we had to do was move the toy,'' Phipps said. ``The bear's
been behaving himself ever since.''

   The Greek Orthodox patriarch
of Jerusalem hurled a golden cross into the muddy Jordan River on
Wednesday and released two white doves to bless the site where
tradition says Jesus was baptized.
   During an annual ceremony at the steep river bank, Patriarch
Diodoros I was surrounded by about 300 pilgrims, most of them
Palestinian and Greek women. Many held plastic and glass bottles to
be filled with blessed river water.
   About a dozen Israeli soldiers armed with submachine guns guarded
the pilgrims as they made their way along barbed wire fences and
mine fields to the river bank.
   Attendance has dropped by about 80 percent since the beginning of
the Palestinian uprising in December 1987, said Father Innocent, a
Greek Orthodox priest. ``People are simply scared,'' he said.
   The Jordan River has served as a cease-fire line since the 1967
Middle East war when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan.
Shortly after the war, Israel closed the river bank to visitors
because of shelling by Palestinian guerrillas.
   Israel first allowed Eastern Orthodox denominations to return for
their annual baptism ceremony in 1981. Roman Catholics, who hold a
ceremony nearby in October, followed in 1985.
   ``The border makes me feel worried,'' said Chris Kalivas, a truck
driver from Athens. ``This is not what I had imagined,'' he added,
pointing at the barren desert lining the 60-foot-wide river.
   ``Everything looks so desolate,'' added Stefan Durst, a Lutheran
pastor from Hamburg, West Germany. Durst said he came out of
professional curiosity.
   Other pilgrims were more cheerful.
   ``I'm not scared. We've come here to pray to Jesus,'' said
Shahira Mahle, 18, who came with a group of 50 Israeli Arab pilgrims
from the northern Israeli town of Nazareth.
   Also among the pilgrims were Russian and Romanian nuns in black
habits and black cone-shaped velvet caps.
   The three-hour ceremony began with the reading of psalms and
scriptures in Greek and Arabic at St. John's Monastery.
   The site, along with other monasteries near the river, was
abandoned in 1970 after a Romanian monk was killed by Palestinian
guerrillas, said Shmuel Hamburger of the West Bank's military
government.
   After the prayers, the patriarch led a procession of 40 chanting
priests in black and gold robes to the river bank.
   Diodoros then hurled the cross, tied to a rope and wrapped in a
bunch of basil, into the murky river. The two white doves released
by the patriarch fluttered over the river before settling among the
reeds at the water's edge.

   Walter Mondale said he'll decide sometime
this year whether to run for his old Senate seat in 1990.
   Suzie Kuhn, an activist in the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party,
said she and her family mailed 400 letters last weekend to party
officers and delegates, asking them to write to Mondale and
encourage him to run against Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz. Kuhn
said Tuesday that she plans to mail another 400 letters.
   Kuhn said she hoped to show Mondale that he has grassroots
support. She said she initiated the letter campaign without talking
to Mondale.
   ``It's flattering, of course,'' said Mondale, adding he would
make a decision later this year.
   ``We may not have been capable of making him president, but we
can certainly return him to the Senate,'' Kuhn said.
   Mondale, 61, was attorney general from 1960 until appointed in
1964 to the Senate, where he remained until 1977. He was vice
president from 1977 to 1981. After losing the 1984 presidential
election, he returned to Minneapolis to practice law.

   U.S. industry operated at its highest rate in
nine years last month, the government reported Wednesday, but
analysts said the modest pace of growth should allay fears of
increasing inflation.
   Use of industrial capacity at factories, mines and utilities rose
0.1 percentage point to 84.2 percent last month, the highest rate
since it hit 84.3 percent in November 1979, the Federal Reserve
said. The operating rate for November 1988 was a revised 84.1
percent, and October's figure was 84.0 percent.
   In an accompanying report, the agency said industrial production
climbed a moderate 0.3 percent in December following a revised
increase of 0.4 percent in November.
   While high operating rates can cause concern that factories will
have trouble meeting demand, resulting in shortages and higher
prices, economists said December's increases were small enough that
they didn't point to higher inflation.
   Lawrence Chimerine of the WEFA Group, consultants in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa., said the reports were ``consistent with continued recovery in
the industrial sector and moderate growth in the economy as a
whole.''
   ``It's probably the best of both worlds,'' he said. ``It showed
continued expansion but at a moderate pace.''
   Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. in New
York said that while operating rates were high, the specter of
inflation ``doesn't seem to be as much on our doorstep as some
people have pretended.''
   On the other hand, Brusca expressed concern that production ``is
not increasing fast enough to satisfy domestic demand and to make
progress'' on the U.S. trade deficit, which widened to $12.5 billion
in November.
   At manufacturing plants, the operating rate climbed to 84.4
percent last month from 84.3 percent in October. The operating rate
for durable goods _ ``big ticket'' items expected to last at least
three years _ rose by 0.1 percentage point to 83.0 percent, while
the rate for non-durable goods fell by a like margin to 86.4 percent.
   Industries with especially strong operating rates over the past
two years include primary metals, chemicals, fabricated metal
products, non-electrical machinery, autos and automotive parts.
   Capacity utilization for manufacturers of motor vehicles and
parts rose for the fifth straight month to 88.1 percent, up from
85.5 percent in November.
   The December operating rate at utilities was 81.9 percent, up
from 81.3 percent a month earlier. In the mining, which includes oil
and gas drilling, the operating rate was up 0.1 percentage point to
83.3 percent.
   The Federal Reserve's industrial production index now stands at
140.2 percent of its 1977 base, reflecting sharp gains in auto
production and continued strength in production of construction
supplies.
   The index has not declined since September 1987, reflecting an
export-driven manufacturing boom accompanied by a surge in spending
for capital equipment to expand and modernize factories.
   Production in manufacturing rose 0.3 percent in December
following a revised increase at the same rate for the month earlier.
Automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.9 million units,
up from 7.6 million in November. Production of light trucks also
rose.
   Output at mines was unchanged in December after a 1.4 percent
rise a month earlier. Production at utilities was up 0.8 percent
from November.
   Total output at factories, mines and utilities was up 4.7 percent
from a year earlier.

   A former Navy technician pleaded innocent
Wednesday to charges he tried to sell anti-submarine warfare secrets
to the Soviets.
   U.S. District Judge Robert G. Doumar set an April 3 trial for
Craig D. Kunkle, 39, of Virginia Beach, who was arrested and charged
with espionage Jan. 10 in an FBI sting.
   Kunkle said he wanted to become a Soviet spy for the money and to
get back at the Navy, which discharged him for indecent exposure in
1985, the FBI said.
   The former chief petty officer is confident he will be
exonerated, and ``his spirits are good,'' defense attorney James C.
Lewis said after the arraignment.
   ``There are two sides to every story. All you've heard so far is
what the government claims occurred in this case,'' he said.
   Kunkle, a hospital security guard, was arrested in Williamsburg
by two FBI agents posing as Soviet officials.
   As a hidden camera recorded the meeting, Kunkle revealed secret
information that he recalled from his job as an anti-submarine
warfare instructor four years ago, the FBI said. Kunkle was paid
$5,000 for the information, the FBI said.
   Lewis said no classified information reached the Soviet Union.
   Kunkle remained jailed without bail. An FBI agent last week
testified that Kunkle called himself smarter and more professional
than former Navy man John A. Walker Jr., who was sentenced to life
in prison in 1986 for running a Soviet spy ring for 17 years.
   Trial preparations are expected to be complicated because
classified information is involved and court personnel must receive
security clearances.
   Lewis said the defense could be helped by the government's
reluctance to reveal classified materials in court.
   ``There is a disincentive for the government to reveal
information and it can work to your advantage,'' he said. ``Whether
it will in this case remains to be seen.''

   When President Reagan donned white tie and
tails last week to attend a fancy dinner in New York City, he
confided to aides he'd had the elegantly styled suit made 40 years
ago, for the 1948 Academy Awards.
   ``It's hard to believe, but it's true,'' said presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, a man who is well-acquainted with the
battle of the bulge. ``I don't think he's even had it altered.''
   Ronald Reagan, who leaves office Friday, bore the burdens of the
presidency for two terms and even weathered a harrowing
assassination attempt in 1981 not to mention a 1985 bout with colon
cancer and a few other surgeries.
   Yet, except for a few more wrinkles _ and some gray hair _ he's
retained a physique that defies the image of a 77-year-old
grandfather.
   Those close to him _ including first lady Nancy Reagan _ say it's
all due to a remarkable discipline, begun as a teen-age lifeguard
and honed as an actor, attentive to diet and physical fitness.
   ``He's in amazing health,'' said Dr. Larry Mohr, one of the
president's White House physicians. ``It has to do with genes, but
also with his attitude. He's just always on an even keel.''
   Reagan has never been shy about the fact that he's religiously
followed a 9-to-5 office schedule, allowing plenty of time for rest
and relaxation. Over his eight-year presidency, Reagan has spent
some 457 days in California, mostly on vacation at his ranch near
Santa Barbara or in his old home town of Los Angeles.
   Aides point out that Reagan's sense of humor, and an ability to
avoid taking himself too seriously, may have helped keep him in
shape.
   Pictures of Reagan, dubbed ``Rawhide'' by the Secret Service,
adorn many White House walls. One favorite shows the president in
jeans, workshirt and protective goggles, with chainsaw in hand and
biceps bulging, as he mows down wizened scrub oak trees on his
California ranch.
   The president chats often with his aides about his diet and how
he keeps healthy, Fitzwater said.
   He is so conscientious about using his body-building equipment on
a daily basis that he had it hauled to Moscow last year for the
three-day summit with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``He
worked out every night, after the meetings and before dinner,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``I peel down and go into the gym,'' Reagan said in a recent
interview with CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' adding that he uses ``a
treadmill and various Nautilus weight equipment.''
   Mrs. Reagan, in the same interview, said she's had to temper
Reagan's enthusiasm for the exercises _ suggested by his physicians
as a way to get back in shape after the 1981 shooting and chest
surgery _ because the president was adding so much muscle he was
threatening to outgrow his suits.
   ``I kept saying, `Stop. Don't increase any more. This is getting
too expensive!'' Mrs. Reagan said with a laugh.
   Reagan keeps a constant watch on his weight _ hovering at 189 to
190 pounds with a 34-inch waistline _ by comparing himself weekly
with his personal physician, Dr. John Hutton, who also tries to hold
to the weight level.
   ``Every Tuesday we have a weigh-off,'' said Hutton recently. ``If
we're a pound or two over, we see who can get it off first.''
   Mrs. Reagan, who says she also tries to follow a daily exercise
routine, recalls that at one time in college she weighed 145 pounds,
but now weighs only 105 or 106 pounds.
   At a recent luncheon, the first lady pooh-poohed reports that she
was anorexic, contending that the worries over her husband's
shooting, as well as her parents' deaths, had caused her to drop
some pounds while in the White House. With a big smile, Mrs. Reagan
eagerly scooped up a dessert of bread pudding.
   But the first lady made clear that the president's eating and
exercise habits are his alone. ``It's his own thing,'' Mrs. Reagan
said in the interview. ``I just think you have to have a
well-balanced, sensible diet. I'm not one for extremes.''
   Fitzwater, who has struggled with diets and poked fun at his own
stocky frame, shakes his head in wonderment at the president's
ability to be ``a very disciplined eater.''
   ``His whole life is very disciplined. ... He just doesn't let
himself go. He drinks a glass of wine at lunch for a state official
or a visiting dignitary. I don't think I've ever seen him take a
hard drink,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman added that he's watched in wonder as Reagan will
consume a green salad or Jell-O, even if others at the same table
are chowing down on a beef Wellington _ which happens to be his
favorite.

   President Reagan said Wednesday that Patricia
Hearst Shaw's pardon request ``hasn't come to my desk for attention
yet'' as a senior official said he did not expect Reagan to grant
``too extraordinary'' pardons before he leaves office Friday.
   The president, during a picture-taking session with members of
Congress who were given presidential citizens medals, was asked
whether he was going to grant Mrs. Shaw's plea.
   ``There are always pardons coming across my desk from the Justice
Department,'' he said. Asked specifically about Mrs. Shaw, convicted
for her role in a San Francisco bank robbery 14 years ago, Reagan
replied, ``No, that hasn't come to my desk for attention yet.''
   The president on Sunday, however, told reporters he had asked
aides ``to look into'' Mrs. Shaw's case.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``There are pardons
that are in the system, but I don't have any status report on
whether or not he has had a chance to review them.''
   A senior official, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said Reagan has pardoned 10 people in the last few weeks through the
normal process, in which the pardons are announced by the courts
rather than by the White House.
   ``My private guidance is not to expect anything too extraordinary
here in the form of pardons,'' the official said. He added, however,
that Reagan has not made final decisions.
   The official said former national security aide Oliver L. North,
Mrs. Shaw and industrialist Armand Hammer were in the category of
potential pardon recipients he had in mind as ``extraordinary.''
   With time running out on his two-term presidency, Reagan has ``as
many as a couple of dozen'' requests still pending, said another
source, who also declined to be named.
   Mrs. Shaw, 34, said earlier this week that she did not know
whether Reagan would grant her a pardon.
   Administration officials would not divulge the names of the 10
pardon requests that Reagan reviewed and sent back to the Justice
Department. ``There are no big names,'' one official said.
   Patty Hearst was sentenced to seven years in a federal prison for
her role in the 1974 armed robbery. She now is married and living in
Connecticut with her husband and two daughters under the married
name of Patty Hearst Shaw.
   Shaw, granddaughter of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst,
asked for the pardon last August. She has maintained that she was
brainwashed by the radical Symbionese Liberation Army, a group of
revolutionaries who kidnapped her in Berkeley, Calif., in February
1974, and orchestrated the bank heist.
   Her seven-year sentence was commuted by President Carter and she
was released from prison on Feb. 1, 1979, after serving 23 months.

<TEXT>
   Azerbaijanis fled 105 Armenian villages prior to
the December earthquake because of ethnic strife over
Nagorno-Karabakh that the Kremlin is trying to break by imposing
direct rule, a Soviet official said.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov spent several weeks in Armenia
managing the response to the Dec. 7 quake, and returned Tuesday for
a meeting with party officials and economic managers. A report on
the meeting was published in Wednesday's Communist Party newspaper
Pravda.
   The earthquake struck after another flare-up of ethnic violence
between Azerbaijanis and Armenians in the southern republics. More
than 60 people have been killed in ethnic unrest in the past year,
and 200,000 people have fled the violence.
   Last week, in order to stem the unrest the Kremlin announced it
was suspending the legislature of Nagorno-Karabakh, the region of
Azerbaijan that Armenia wants to annex, and impose direct Kremlin
rule.
   ``This is a compromise under which a mutually acceptable balance
of interests of the two republics is observed,'' Ryzhkov said.
   ``The decision made about Nagorno-Karabakh is no one's victory
and no one's loss. It was dictated solely: to lessen tension in the
region, re-establish order, give people the possibility to live,
work and raise their children normally,'' he said.
   Even prior to the earthquake, the Azerbaijani population of 105
Armenian villages fled because of the ethnic tension, he said. Now
that Armenia is trying to rebuild from the quake that killed about
25,000 people, there is an insufficient number of people to organize
workers and tend cattle and sheep, he said.
   Ryzhkov and Suren Arutunyan, Communist Party chief of Armenia,
both partially blamed Armenian intellectuals for encouraging the
drive to annex Nagorno-Karabakh, which began with demands made by
the primarily ethnic Armenian population of the area in February.
   Ryzhkov said positive changes were seen in the mood of Armenia,
but that in order to heal the wounds left by the violence, changes
must continue to take place from the bottom as well as directed by
the Kremlin.
   On Tuesday, Pravda said 49 Communist Party and government
officials in Armenia had been sacked for encouraging nationalism and
a variety of other offenses including blackmail.
   In a separate article Wednesday, Pravda said Y.P. Kochetkov had
been replaced as the Armenian party's second secretary by O.I. Lobov
and was trasnferred to unspecified other work.
   It said a member of the Armenian Politburo, F.T. Sarkisyan had
retired and his place was taken by Armenian Premier V.S. Markaryants.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Lifting Ban on Companies' Libya Operations Studied</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Wednesday that easing
sanctions barring U.S. oil companies from doing business in Libya is
``under study right now.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said no decision had been
reached, and an announcement would be made by the Treasury
Department when there is one.
   Reagan, asked about the possibility at a medal-presenting
ceremony, said, ``I can only say it's under study right now as to
that situation.''
   Officials have said that continuing the prohibition, put into
effect three years ago, could end up benefiting Libyan strongman
Moammar Gadhafi.
   Several U.S. companies have been barred since mid-l986 from doing
business directly in Libya, but they have kept their assets there
under an agreement with the Libyan government.
   The agreement froze the assets of five American companies:
Amerada Hess, Marathon Oil, W.R. Grace, Occidental Petroleum and
Conoco Petroleum.
   Some U.S. officials have expressed concern that if the ban is
continued Gadhafi might seize the frozen assets.

   About 5,000 people converged on the
city's central Wenceslas Square today chanting ``Freedom!''
``Truth!'' and ``Human rights!'' in the fourth consecutive day of
public dissent.
   The group also chanted the name of jailed dissident Vaclav Havel
and others arrested for taking part in protests in the Czechoslovak
capital since Sunday.
   In a reversal of tactics that drew strong Western criticism,
police kept watch on the demonstrators but did not try to disperse
them.
   On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, police used water cannons, tear
gas, dogs and batons to break up crowds that gathered to commemorate
the 20th anniversary of the death of Jan Palach, who set himself
afire Jan. 16, 1969 to protest the presence of Soviet troops in
Czechoslovakia after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion.
   The demonstrators who began assembling on the square around 5
p.m. today attracted thousands of curious onlookers on their way
home from work.

   A clotting protein made through genetic engineering
appears promising for people with the bleeding disease hemophilia
and may provide an AIDS-free alternative to current treatments,
researchers report.
   In a report in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, Dr.
Gilbert C. White II and others from the University of North Carolina
described the first use of the genetically engineered protein in two
people.
   One of them received 44 doses, while the other got 35. The
researchers said the treatment appeared to work well.
   ``We think it will be a blessing _ truly virus-free and truly
safe,'' said Alan Brownstein, executive director of the Hemophilia
Foundation.
   Hemophiliacs lack a protein, called factor VIII, that is
essential for making blood clots. As a result, they frequently
suffer internal bleeding and must receive infusions of clotting
protein derived from human blood.
   During the early 1980s, these treatments were often tainted with
the AIDS virus. In 1984, after that was discovered, manufacturers
began heating factor VIII to kill the virus. The strategy greatly
reduced the problem but was not foolproof. However, many experts
believe that adding detergents and other refinements to the
purification process has made natural factor VIII virtually free of
AIDS.
   To produce clotting protein that is indisputedly free of AIDS and
other viruses, the North Carolina researchers inserted the human
gene that controls production of factor VIII into animal cells.
These cells then made the protein.
   The National Hemophilia Foundation estimates that about 60
percent of the nation's 20,000 hemophiliacs are infected with the
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   It is not known how many of those people will eventually get the
disease. Currently, only about 900 hemophiliacs have been reported
to have AIDS _ slightly more than 1 percent of the nation's 83,000
AIDS cases.
   Among all AIDS virus carriers, about 20 percent and 30 percent
can be expected to contract the disease within five years, according
to Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Their longer term prospects are
not yet known.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha suffered a
stroke at home Wednesday, but was ``clear-minded'' and might appoint
a Cabinet member as acting president, his office said.
   Botha, who turned 73 on Jan. 12, was in stable condition at No. 2
Military Hospital in the Cape Town suburb of Wynberg after suffering
a mild stroke, his office said. No further details were released.
   Botha's health generally has been excellent since he took charge
of South Africa's white-run government as prime minister in 1978.
Under a new constitution, he became president in 1984.
   Elize Botha, the president's wife of 46 years, and some of their
five children came to the hospital to be with him, state radio said.
   Botha was hospitalized shortly after 8 a.m., according to the
South African Broadcasting Corp.
   Botha's office said he was ``quite clear-minded'' and was likely
to appoint one of his Cabinet ministers as acting president on
Thursday.
   According to South Africa's Constitution, the president can
appoint a Cabinet minister to fill in for him temporarily. If the
president is incapacitated, the Cabinet can elect one of its members
as acting president.
   Botha has refused to comment on his possible retirement. There
has been intense speculation, but no consensus, about which Cabinet
member might be selected by the National Party as Botha's successor.
   Among those mentioned as presidential contenders are Foreign
Minister Pik Botha, who is not related to him; National Education
Minister F.W. de Klerk; Constitutional Development Minister Chris
Heunis; Finance Minister Barend du Plessis; and Defense Minister
Magnus Malan.
   None of these men is considered likely to make fundamental
changes in current National Party policy, although Pik Botha is
viewed as slightly more liberal than the others.
   The stroke occurred a few days after Botha returned to Cape Town
from a month-long holiday at his coastal vacation home. On Friday,
he was to meet members of Namibia's territorial Cabinet to discuss
the planned transition to independence by year's end.
   Pik Botha said he would chair the meeting with the Namibian
officials.
   Parliament is due to open Feb. 3, and there has been widespread
speculation that President Botha would announce a general election
to take place in late April. National Party leaders have suggested
the early election because they believe their opponents on both the
left and right are in disarray.
   During his years in power, Botha has maintained the National
Party's political dominance despite criticism both from the
anti-apartheid movement and from extreme-right whites.
   He pushed throught the first significant racial reforms
undertaken during the National Party's 40-year rule, such as
legalization of interracial marriages and abolition of pass laws
that restricted blacks' movements.
   But he has refused to negotiate with the African National
Congress guerrilla movement or to release the ANC's jailed leader,
Nelson Mandela. Botha has said he would not even discuss the
possibility of a one-person, one-vote system in South Africa, where
the 5 million whites control the government and economy while the 26
million blacks have no vote in national affairs.
   The Wynberg hospital is about a mile from the Constantiaberg
Clinic, where Mandela spent several weeks recuperating from
tuberculosis last year before being transferred to a suburban-style
staff home at a prison farm in the wine-growing town of Paarl.
   The hospital in Wynberg, part of a military base, is considered
one of the best in southern Africa. Botha laid the cornerstone for
the main building in 1976, when he was defense minister.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III
said today the United States and the Soviet Union are close to
agreement on verification procedures for two long-pending nuclear
test ban treaties.
   Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that when all
work on the two treaties is completed they will be submitted to the
Senate for ratification.
   Baker, whose confirmation as secretary of state is virtually
assured, said he believes verification problems on the 1976 Peaceful
Nuclear Explosions Treaty are ``completely resolved.''
   And he said verification procedures are ``close to being
resolved'' on the 1974 nuclear test ban treaty which would establish
a limit of 150 kilotons on underground tests.
   Testifying on the second day of his confirmation hearings, Baker
also agreed to a proposal by Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., to
discuss in private Biden's ideas on revising and implementing the
controversial War Powers Act which provides a mechanism for Congress
to reverse a presidential decision to commit U.S. forces to combat
or meet the threat of combat.
   But, declaring that ``I don't want to pursue this under false
colors,'' Baker said there are many in government ``who feel very
strongly that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, including the
president-elect.''
   Biden said failure to try to reach a compromise on the issue will
``lead to an impasse every single time'' a president decides to
commit U.S. forces.
   ``If that's your position, I can assure you there will be no
bipartisanship,'' Biden said.
   But Biden said there may be ways to address the constitutional
issues and still leave a voice for Congress. Baker said he would be
willing to pursue the matter.
   On another subject, Baker said the Bush administration will
maintain a high standard of insisting on human rights protection
around the world, whether abuses are committed ``by governments of
the left or of the right.''
   Responding to questions, Baker said he believes the Bush
adminiration will move to combat the environmental hazards poised by
acid rain in ``a coordinated and responsible way.''
   ``I think you'll see a new approach toward acid rain from this
administration,'' Baker said, noting Bush's campaign promises on the
issue.
   He indicated Bush will not move precipitously, however, and
underscored the need to deal with acid rain ``from a national and
international standpoint.''
   He told senators: ``You have my commitment to work at the
problem, because I think it is a very serious matter.''
   In testimony on Tuesday, Baker promised regular consultations
with congressional leaders and asked for bipartisan support in
return.
   ``In order to succeed we simply must work together,'' Baker said
Tuesday. ``That is the verdict of history and that is the verdict of
recent experience.''
   Baker ended the first of two days of confirmation hearings before
the foreign relations panel with the endorsement of virtually every
member.
   Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said the panel will vote on the
Baker nomination Thursday morning, one day before Bush is sworn in
as president. The full Senate will act later.
   Baker, on Tuesday, used such words as ``prudence,'' ``realism''
and ``caution'' to describe the proper U.S. attitude to the
startling economic and foreign policy changes championed by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   And he refused to commit the incoming Bush administration to
resuming nuclear arms control talks with the Soviet Union by any
specific date, even though senators repeatedly urged him to do so.
   One member, Sen. Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., noted that Bush ran for
president in large part on his experience in handling foreign policy
and arms control issues, contrasting himself favorably with Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
   Biden said it appeared odd to him that Bush and Baker should now
contend they need an extended period to review the proper
negotiating positions at arms control talks.
   The START talks on deep cuts in strategic nuclear weapons have
been recessed since November, and Baker said the new
administration's approach to them is among several key policy areas
that are ``under review.''
   Baker also said he believed the strategic talks should be pursued
on their own merits and not be linked to other issues, including
agreement on reducing conventional arms.
   The United States should welcome Gorbachev's reforms and any
positive change in Soviet human rights, foreign policy and defense
postures, Baker said.
   But he cautioned: ``The talk is different, but the force
structure and policies that support far-reaching interests and
clients have not changed commensurately. Many of those policies and
those clients are hostile to American values and threaten our
interests and our allies. That's a reality.''

<HEAD>Government May Have Acted Hastily to Restrict Co-ops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government officials who have ordered cooperatives
out of lucrative fields such as medicine and publishing apparently
didn't count on the high cost of buying them out, a leader of co-op
movement said Wednesday.
   The Dec. 29 directive of the Soviet Council of Ministers ordered
some cooperatives to close by Feb. 1.
   ``Up to now, not one co-op has closed because of the decision,
and I do not know of any that show any inclination of ceasing their
activity,'' said Vladimir Yakovlev, chairman of the FAKT market
research and consulting cooperative.
   ``If the co-ops are closed, the state will have to pay back all
losses due to the decision. I think that the people who decided to
close the cooperatives did not calculate concretely how much it
would cost the government,'' he told a news conference.
   The directive ordered medical and publishing coops to close, as
well as video salons, which provide snacks and tea to viewers who
watch films.
   It costs between $48,000 and $80,000 to start a video salon in
Moscow, he said.
   The cost of starting a medical co-op is considerably higher.
Medical co-ops and video salons make up only about 6 percent of the
cooperatives in Moscow, but the government would be forced to pay
out a ``significant'' amount of money to buy them out, Yakovlev said.
   The directive was based on emotion rather than economics, and by
enforcing it the government would contradict its own reform effort,
Yakovlev said.
   Video salons were doing a booming business when the government
decided to restrict them, he said, implying that if demand counts
for little, economic reform is doomed.
   ``If the decision of the ministers becomes law, the cooperative
movement will not be able to continue,'' Yakovlev said.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has encouraged development of the
cooperative movement in all spheres, although citizens themselves
certainly would agree to restrictions regarding ventures that pose a
risk to the public.
   ``The decision is a most unpleasant fact in the history of the
cooperative movement,'' he said.
   Government bureaucrats as well as the general public know little
about the economics of the cooperative movement, he said.
   ``A great deal is said about the negative attitude of the
population toward coops. The basis of this attitude is the people's
lack of comprehension of the laws of economics. According to our
statistics, only one out of 10 persons understands how prices are
determined in a free market, and I think the decision shows that
same lack of comprehension in the ministries and state
organizations.''
   Cooperatives have no way to influence events, Yakovlev said. To
try to remedy their lack of clout, three major co-op associations,
each with between 1,000 and 2,500 co-op members, plan to organize a
union through which owners hope to be able to elect delegates to
legislative bodies.

<TEXT>
   Police on Wednesday made a nationwide
appeal for information on the abduction of former Prime Minister
Paul Vanden Boeynants, and his family expressed fears for his life
in an emotional radio message.
   Vanden Boeynants' son, Christian, said the family has ``received
no sign of life of my father up to now.''
   ``We haven't had the least contact with the kidnappers and thus,
there are no negotiations,'' he said on national BRT radio. It was
the first public reaction from the family since Vanden Boeynants
disappeared Saturday.
   Authorities considered broadcasting a phone call taped Monday in
which a man claiming to represent the Revolutionary Socialist
Brigade said the group was holding the former leader.
   The caller said the brigade would return Vanden Boeynants ``in
little pieces.'' Investigators hope the public might be able to
identify the voice.
   The brigade demanded the equivalent of $789,000 in a letter to
two newspapers, but did not provide proof it actually held the
69-year-old politician or that he was still alive.
   Officials have expressed concern about the health of Vanden
Boeynants, who needs heart medicine when under stress.
   ``My mother, my sister and myself are very worried,'' Christian
Vanden Boeynants said on the radio.
   ``Anyone who has information on this subject is asked to contact
the coordination center,'' the police appeal said. It was
distributed by the national news agency Belga.
   The brigade said in a letter to the Brussels newspapers Le Soir
and Het Laatste Nieuws on Tuesday that the politician will have to
appear before a ``People's Tribunal'' for corruption and alleged
misuse of funds and could face the ``supreme'' sanction.
   Vanden Boeynants received a three-year suspended sentence in 1986
for financial fraud as head of his meat packaging business and is
under parliamentary investigation for allegedly accepting bribes as
defense minister in the 1970s.
   The brigade called Vanden Boeynants ``a corrupt person ... who
has stolen large public funds for his own profit.''
   About 10 claims of responsibilty have been made since Vanden
Boeynants disappeared, but in most cases the authenticity was
doubtful, said deputy Brussels Prosecutor Andre Vandoren.
   The brigade demanded that two-thirds of the ransom money go to
relief agencies.
   Experts of left-wing terrorism said the group's letter was
``amateurish.'' ``Such poor language wouldn't be tolerated by groups
like the Red Army Faction ... the Red Brigades or Action Directe,''
said Rudolf Boehm, a professor at Ghent University.
   Vanden Boeynants disappeared near his home in a posh Brussels
neighborhood late Saturday. The cover of a syringe found near his
home had traces of a tranquilizer.
   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and again
from late 1978 until early 1979 and was also defense minister for
seven years in the 1970s.
   He was a Brussels city councilor from 1952 until 1985 and was
re-elected in October.
   As Public Works alderman in Brussels, he razed several old
neighborhoods to make way for high-rise buildings, and Brussels
became known for its destructive urban renewal. The brigade letter
named a Brussels construction company as one of Vanden Boeynants'
business partners who must help contribute funds to the ransom.

   Lee Atwater, the tough political operator who
managed George Bush's presidential campaign, was elected Republican
Party chairman today and he took office with a call for the GOP to
``reach into communities where the Republican message has not yet
found a home.''
   As Bush's choice to run the party, the 37-year-old South
Carolinian was elected chairman without opposition for a two-year
term.
   He succeeded Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., who served as chairman of
the Republican National Committee for six years, the longest tenure
in this century.
   In his speech to the committee, Atwater described the GOP
victories in the last three presidential elections as ``the triumph
of an idea. We are heirs to a political movement that offers new
hope to millions of Americans.''
   The new party chairman said Bush's victory over Democrat Michael
Dukakis was ``because we have better ideas and we had the best
candidate.''
   But he also said the party now must strive to control the
redistricting process under which legislative districts, at the
state and federal levels, will be redrawn in 1991 to conform to
population shifts determined by the 1990 census.
   Atwater said the Republicans also must work to attract
minorities, to ``reach into communities where the Republican message
has not yet found a home.''
   ``We have been fighting with one arm tied behind our back _
because the Democrats have succeeded in virtually cornering the
votes of whole segments of American society,'' he said, citing
blacks, Hispanics, Asians and the disabled.
   ``Our program of low taxes and economic growth, of standards in
schools and safer streets, has a great appeal to Americans of all
colors and backgrounds,'' he said.
   Bush and Vice President-elect Dan Quayle appeared briefly at a
Republican committee luncheon and the president-elect endorsed
Atwater's outreach program.
   ``I like the concept that our party needs to have a broader base,
a stronger participation,'' he said.
   Bush said Atwater ``will be my political eyes and ears. ... I'm
here to say I want to work with the party.''
   As he left office, Fahrenkopf also emphasized the need to control
the redistricting process and pointed out that in the 1988 election,
98 percent of House members who sought re-election were victorious.
   He asked, ``Why is it that today there is more change in the
Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. than there is in the American House
of Representatives?''
   Fahrenkopf said according to the State Department, the Supreme
Soviet recently returned 96.1 percent of its members.
   When Bush designated Atwater as his choice to head the committee,
he said, ``He's a friend. I'm proud of his accomplishments.''
   Political rivals claim Atwater's accomplishments often are
tainted by roughhouse tactics.
   ``He's got a tough-guy image,'' said South Carolina GOP chairman
Van Hipp. ``I think Lee enjoys it to be honest with you.''
   For most of the 165 Republican committee members, the meeting was
a routine piece of business leading up to the inauguration of Bush
on Friday and the round of parties keyed to that event.
   In recent interviews, Atwater said a top priority would be trying
to expand the party's appeal to blacks, Hispanics, Asians and the
handicapped.
   While getting 53 percent of the overall vote in the 1988 election
and carrying 40 states, Bush received only 12 percent of the black
vote, according to a New York Times-CBS poll. That was marginally
better than Reagan who attracted the votes of 11 percent of blacks
in 1980 and nine percent in 1984.
   Among Hispanics, the Bush total was estimated at about 30
percent, down from Reagan's totals of 35 percent in 1980 and 37
percent in 1984.
   Atwater paid tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. recently as ``an
American hero.'' The incoming GOP chairman was Bush's representative
at ceremonies marking King's birthday at the Ebenezer Baptist Church
in Atlanta where the late civil rights leader was pastor.
   Bush used similar language when he spoke at a prayer breakfast
Monday, the national holiday marking King's birth.
   The president-elect said King ``lived a hero's life. He dreamed a
hero's imagination of a great nation.''
   A private panel called the Citizens Commission on Civil Rights
issued a report Tuesday that criticized the Reagan administration
for ``a complete breakdown'' of endorsement of civil rights laws.
   Chairman Arthur Flemming said the group was sending its report to
Bush ``in the hope that he can turn around the '80s as far as civil
rights enforcement is concerned.''

   It costs a pretty penny to ride in style around
the nation's capital this inaugural week, and even wealthy would-be
power travelers may find themselves hailing taxicabs if they
procrastinate.
   Limousine operators report capacity or near-capacity bookings for
the week. One has switched its phones over to an answering service,
whose operators deliver the news: ``They are booked solid.''
   Those fortunate enough to find a limousine are paying to keep it
at their disposal. Because of demand, most Washington-area companies
are leasing on a three- or four-day basis, with the car and
chauffeur on call eight to 10 hours each day.
   The cost: $2,700 at Presidential Limousine Service. There is an
alternative package, referred to among the in-crowd as ``sans
stretch.'' Translation: For $1,600 one can rent a car and driver for
four days, but the car will be a Lincoln Town Car sedan, not the
stretch limousine that comes with the pricier deal.
   Some companies are charging more; some a bit less. ``It's really
a seller's market,'' said Presidential's Herta Mullens.
   Some would-be clients have special requests.
   ``A lot have asked for bodyguards,'' said Mullens. ``We call it
executive protection, but they're essentially bodyguards.''
   High rollers who don't need a limo for four days but want a
classy ride to a single event may find it tough to find one. But,
not surprisingly, where there's a wallet, there's a way.
   ``If they are willing to pay the price, no one will go home
unhappy,'' Mullens said. ``With a little shuffling I can get someone
from their hotel to a ball for $1,000.''
   The ball-bound appear undeterred by the cost.
   ``They pause for a while when they hear the price,'' said
Mullens, ``and then say `OK, put me down.'''

   Many of the high-powered Republicans who came to Washington to
see George Bush become president evidently were a bit hesitant about
his chances _ until the pollsters told them to relax and reserve.
   All 240 rooms and suites at the capital's plush Ritz-Carlton are
booked, including one offered as part of a $15,000 inaugural package
the hotel proudly boasted included ``the most expensive hotel room
in Washington.''
   But bookings were slow for a while. Hotel spokeswoman Vivian
Deuschl said the pace of reservations for the inaugural appeared
tied to Bush's lead in the pre-election polls.
   ``Every time Bush went up in the polls we got more phone calls,''
Ms. Deuschl said. ``Then, when everybody was saying it was all over
we started getting requests for room blocks.''
   By Election Day, the Ritz was booked for inaugural week.
   The least expensive room is $290 a night, with a four-night
minimum this week. Those lucky enough to land a suite pay between
$800 and $1,200 a night.
   Among the Ritz's registered guests is real estate mogul Donald

   Tuxedos and tacos may seem an odd mix, but the hands-down winner
as the most-sought after ticket in town is a ducat for a Texas State
Society black-tie affair with a Tex-Mex menu.
   The 5,500 tickets to the Saturday night Black Tie and Boots Ball
sold out in less than 24 hours, sales fueled by speculation the new
president will show up to salute his adopted home state.
   The tickets sold for $50, well below the $1,500 charged for some
of the fancier inaugural dinners. But as well-heeled Republicans
converge on the capital for Friday's inauguration, many are offering
to raise the ante for coveted tickets to the Texas hoedown.
   ``It's the big thing, at the top of the list,'' said Michelle
Davis, executive director of the Republican Governors Association.
``People are offering $1,000 and more for a $50 ticket. Obviously
this is the hip place to be.''

   Georgette Mosbacher made her much-awaited public inaugural week
debut Wednesday, attending a luncheon and saying she was ``very
excited'' about joining Washington's social circuit.
   Mrs. Mosbacher and her husband, Commerce Secretary-designate
Robert Mosbacher, were among the featured guests at the Inaugural
Salute to Women in Business Luncheon.
   Mrs. Mosbacher was a prime topic of conversation at a brief
reception before the luncheon and a murmur spread through the room
as the Mosbachers entered just as Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle, finished brief remarks to the gathering.
   ``I'm enjoying it very much,'' she said when asked about her
first visit to Washington since President-elect Bush named his
longtime friend to the Commerce post.
   ``It's a very exciting town,'' she said. ``I'm really enjoying
it.''
   The Mosbachers have quickly become desired guests at Washington
parties.
   ``That's what they tell me,'' said Mrs. Mosbacher who was
featured in a Washington Post Magazine profile on Sunday. ``This is
just the beginning,'' she said.

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Forcibly Taken Away After Two Years In Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police burst into a church vestry
Wednesday and dragged away a Sri Lankan seeking political asylum, an
action one critic called an ``act of savagery'' against the ancient
right to sanctuary.
   Viraj Mendis, an activist who says he fears persecution or death
if he returns home, had handcuffed himself to a radiator when 16
police and two immigration agents broke into the Church of the
Ascension in the rundown Hulme district, police said.
   Police cut Mendis' handcuffs with acetylene torches, and a
witness said the 32-year-old screamed ``Murderers! Murderers!'' as
they took him to a London prison to await deportation, scheduled for
Friday.
   Officials said Mendis, who had been living in the church since
receiving a deportation order two years ago, would be sent home
unless a third country accepted him.
   ``The fact that someone is in a church does not give them any
immunity from the law,'' Home Secretary Douglas Hurd told a noisy
session of Parliament.
   Some opposition lawmakers shouted ``Sieg heil!'' and ``KGB!''
Three spectators, one shouting ``Do not send him to his death!''
were thrown out of the public gallery.
   But other politicians cheered as Hurd, the minister responsible
for immigration affairs, warned the church to ``think carefully
before it enters into any habit or custom of giving shelter to those
defying the law.''
   Home Office Minister Timothy Renton said the government ``always
felt that the situation in Sri Lanka did not justify the position
that Mendis and his supporters were adopting.''
   Mendis, a member of his nation's Sinhalese majority, says his
life is threatened by his political activism on behalf of communism
and the Tamil minority. He came to Britain in 1973 as a student.
   His supporters said Mendis' removal from the church violated his
rights and endangered his life. About 200 people marched in protest
in this northern England city.
   Under English common law, a person accused of committing a crime
could take sanctuary in a church but had to surrender or leave the
country in 40 days. The provision was abolished in 1623, but Mendis'
supporters used the ancient right as a last resort to argue his case.
   ``People seeking sanctuary like this have never been dealt with
like this, by violence, before,'' said opposition Labor Party
legislator Keith Vaz. ``As a Christian I say it is an act of
savagery which is a disgrace.''
   The human rights group Amnesty International told Hurd that
Mendis ``would be at risk of torture or ill treatment, arrest and
prolonged detention without charge'' if he returned home.
   An advisory body to the Roman Catholic Church issued a statement
that did not mention Mendis, but said ``asylum seekers from Sri
Lanka should not be sent back'' because of ethnic strife.
   The Committee for Community Relations of the Catholic Bishops'
Conference, headed by Bishop Leo McCartie of Birmingham, said the
situation in Sri Lanka is ``now so serious that governments should
clearly risk erring on the side of caution lest lives be necessarily
be lost.''
   Mendis' lawyer, David Burgess, said his client also feared
Sinhalese groups fighting Tamil demands for an independent state.
   Chandra Monerawela, the Sri Lankan high commissioner to London,
said ``Mendis is an unknown entity in Sri Lanka _ he is not wanted
for any criminal or civil offense.''
   Burgess said he will challenge the deportation in the European
Court of Human Rights, although his client already has lost two
immigration appeals. Last month, Britain's highest court, the Law
Lords, refused to hear the case.
   The Rev. John Methuen, the vicar whose church gave Mendis asylum,
said police broke into his home, cut telephone and burglar alarm
wires, and smashed in the door of the vestry where Mendis slept.
   ``There is quite a lot of damage to the building,'' he said.
   Church council member Ingrid Falat said police cut Mendis free
and carried him away.
   Greater Manchester Assistant Chief Constable David Phillips,
however, described the operation as ``low-key'' and denied that
police had cut telephone or alarm wires. He offered to repair the
damaged doors.
   Methuen and the bishop of Hulme, the Rt. Rev. Colin Scott, said
the government's action will jeopardize Mendis' chances of getting
asylum outside Britain.

<HEAD>News Report Says Turkish Peasants Were Paid To Donate Kidneys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turkish police have arrested the alleged organizer
of an operation in which peasants were paid to donate kidneys for
transplant recipients at a private London hospital, a newspaper
reported Wednesday.
   The Independent said the peasants were offered the equivalent of
$3,540 to donate one of their kidneys, and traveled to London for
the operations.
   It said police in Istanbul arrested Tunc Kunter on Tuesday and
charged him with cheating people out of body organs. Kunter admitted
running the operation but said he was motivated by a sense of
humanity, not profit, the newspaper reported.
   It said the kidney removal operations were carried out under the
care of Dr. Raymond Crockett at the exclusive, privately owned
Wellington Humana Hospital in west London.
   The paper quoted Crockett as saying: ``I would be satisfied there
is no duress. As far as anything else is concerned, I think it is
not my brief (my concern).''
   Crockett and an unidentified hospital official said the
operations were carried out legally, with the donors' consent,
according to the newspaper.
   It quoted the British government's Health Department as saying
trade in kidneys for transplant into patients suffering kidney
failure is discouraged but not illegal in Britain.
   John Patten, former parliamentary undersecretary of state for
health, ordered an review when a similar trade involving Pakistanis
was disclosed in 1985.
   ``Three years later, a spokesman for the department said
yesterday that no action had yet been taken,'' the newspaper
reported.

<TEXT>
   Nine people were arrested Wednesday for
publishing books supporting North Korean President Kim Il Sung and
his communist idelogy.
   In a raid on several major bookstores and printing shops in
Seoul, prosecutors also seized 3,580 pro-North Korean books,
including ``Kim Il Sung Selections.''
   Those arrested may be charged with violating the tough National
Security Law, prosecution officials said. The law provides for five
to eight years in jail terms for violators.
   South Korea has recently eased restrictions on information on
North Korea, but the books seized were believed extremely harmful
for South Korea's ``wholesome, free, democratic system.''
   Prosecution authorities said they would continue a crackdown on
pro-North Korean publications.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan presented the Citizens Medal
today to 38 people ranging from movie actor Charlton Heston to the
late Ambassador to Pakistan Arnold L. Raphel and including three
leading congressional Republicans.
   The awards to Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, House Minority
Leader Robert Michel and Sen. Strom Thurmond, former president pro
tempore of the Senate and the chamber's senior member, were made at
a ceremony in the Cabinet Room, with reporters present.
   The other awards were made in the East Room to which reporters
were not admitted.
   The Citizens Medal is awarded to recognize U.S. citizens who have
performed exemplary deeds or service for their country or their
fellow citizens.
   Raphel was killed last Aug. 17 in the crash of a military
transport plane that also took the life of Pakistan's President
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq.
   In the public ceremony, Reagan said of Dole, the senior senator
from Kansas and a combat veteran of World War II: ``Whether on the
battlefield or Capitol Hill, Senate Robert Dole has served America
heroically.''
   Reagan said Michel, a representative from Illinois, was ``the man
who could always be counted on by his president, his constituents
and his country.''
   Turning to Thurmond, the Republican senator from South Carolina,
the president said, ``He worked to appoint conservative judges and
strong proponents of constitutional law.''
   Thurmond responded, ``I appreciate this, coming from the finest
president since George Washington.''
   The medal recipients were accompanied by their families.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan personally
selected the recipients.

relieve back pain caused by pinched nerves.
   Turner, 59, is ``in good spirits and feeling fine,'' said Jane
McDowell, a party spokeswoman.
   Doctors at Toronto General Hospital performed surgery to remove a
small part of bone in the lower-back region that had been pinching
nerves.
   The problem caused the opposition leader to limp throughout much

   Turner will spend a week at his apartment in Toronto before
returning to Ottawa. He also plans a two-week vacation to Jamaica in

<TEXT>
   The son of senior leader Deng Xiaoping on
Wednesday denied rumors that his 84-year-old father is in poor
health.
   ``I may tell you that he is very healthy,'' Deng Pufang was
quoted by the official Xinhua News Agency as telling a news
conference.
   Rumors that Deng was in poor health caused a sharp drop in the
Hong Kong stock exchange last week.
   Speculation about the health of China's top leader is common, but
he has appeared fit in recent appearances and his only known
disability is poor hearing in one ear.
   The younger Deng, who heads the China Welfare Fund for the
Handicapped, also denied foreign reports that he has private
accounts in overseas banks, saying ``it is a fairy tale.''
   ``If any of you reporters here find that I have savings in any
overseas banks, 70 percent will go to you and the remaining 30
percent go to a bank of China,'' he said.
   Deng travels abroad frequently as China's leading advocate for
the disabled. He has been paralyzed from the waist down since the
Cultural Revolution in the 1960s, when leftist Red Guards threw him
out of a fifth-floor window.

<TEXT>
   Frances and Hsin-Yi Lee have spent two
weeks shuttling between lawyers' offices, the prosecutors office and
a hospital where their son, Thomas, is in a coma from
cyanide-poisoning.
   Their lives have been subject to microscopic scrutiny _
investigators have even rifled through their kitchen garbage _ and
their telephone rings incessantly.
   ``This is a real nightmare for an otherwise private family,''
said Dr. Robert Nagele, a family friend. ``But now every aspect of
their life has been made very public.''
   Thomas, 17, a junior at Haddonfield Memorial High School, has
been in critical condition and on life-support machinery at West
Jersey Hospital-Voorhees since Jan. 3, when he ate black cherry
yogurt laced with cyanide.
   On Thursday a guardian appointed to represent Thomas' welfare
must file court papers over whether his life-support machines should
be disconnected. Hospital officials have painted a dismal picture of
his chances of recovery.
   Police have not ruled out attempted homicide or suicide. But they
say one thing is almost certain: The yogurt package was not tampered
with at the factory or the store.
   The Lees have adamantly insisted in statements released through
attorneys that their son would not have tried to kill himself, and
that he was too popular to be the target of a slaying.
   Camden County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell said last week the boy's
parents and brother were not targets of the investigation into how
the cyanide got into the carton of yogurt.
   But family members were fingerprinted this week and two FBI
agents fingerprinted Thomas at the hospital Saturday, said George
Kerns, a spokesman for Asbell.
   Kerns said investigators wanted the fingerprints for comparison
to items taken from the Lee home and the father's laboratory at
Rutgers University in Camden, where he is chairman of the biology
department.
   Asbell declined to describe the items under investigation, but
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said a tiny plastic vial
of cyanide was found at the Lee home. Asbell has declined to confirm
or deny whether cyanide was found at the elder Lee's laboratory.
   In the meantime, Nagele, a former student of Lee and now
professor of pediatrics at the University of Medicine and Dentistry
of New Jersey in Camden, has tried to shield the family from
reporters.
   ``They deserve a little peace,'' he said. ``People are forgetting
that Tommy's still on life support. Their thoughts should be with
him.''
   ``They're just heart-broken,'' said attorney Alan Turner. ``I
think they're experiencing what any parents would experience upon
such a tragedy.''
   Lee, 53, came to the United States from Taiwan in 1961 and earned
his doctorate from the University of Minnesota. He became a
professor at Rutgers in 1968 and is recognized as an expert on early
brain development.
   ``Students are always trying to beat down the door to get in his
lab,'' said Nagele, who worked in Lee's lab for five years and is
currently collaborating with him on a number of projects.
   Outside of his work, Lee has few hobbies or pastimes. His wife,
Frances, also a Taiwanese immigrant who holds a master's degree in
immunology from Eastern Illinois, has primarily been a homemaker
since the birth of Thomas.
   ``They have done the best over the years, to the point of
spoiling their boys,'' said Nagele. ``They were very devoted to
their children.''
   Thomas' brother, Bruce, 20, is a student at Harvard University.
``They were always together,'' Nagele said. ``There was no direct
competition.''
   The brothers have been popular, out-going students.
   Thomas, a 160-pound wrestler, had ``so much going for him,'' said
classmate Zachary Resnicoff, captain of the school's wrestling team.
``He has lots of friends and likes school.''
   Nagele and school officials described Thomas as a good student
and a gifted artist and musician.
   ``He's a super kid,'' said head wrestling coach Joe Frassenei.
``He's very bright, well-liked by his teammates.''

<HEAD>Audit Finds Slipshod Control Involving Chemicals in Meat and Poultry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An internal audit by the Agriculture Department
says that federal control of illegally high traces of pesticides and
other chemicals in the nation's meat and poultry supply has been
slipshod and sometimes ineffective.
   The investigators found that in some cases meat and poultry
containing too much of these chemical residues slipped through and
got into the consumer pipeline.
   ``Even when animals were presented to inspectors, (agency)
administrative controls and current policies did not ensure timely
and effective response when pesticide residue was suspected or found
in meat and poultry products,'' the report said. ``As a result, some
adulterated products were allowed to enter commerce.''
   The report by the department's Office of Inspector General said
the department's inspection agency _ the Food Safety and Inspection
Service, or FSIS _ has little authority to prevent pesticide
residues from showing up in meat and poultry.
   Accordingly, the FSIS has turned to the food industry itself for
cooperation in monitoring levels of chemicals and ferreting out
violations.
   The agency's chief responsibility is to ensure that
USDA-inspected meat and poultry products are safe, wholesome and
free of adulterating chemicals. As part of its responsibility, the
agency samples and analyzes edible tissues to see if they meet the
federal standards.
   But the system is far from foolproof, and the agency also
includes efforts to enlighten farmers and processors about the
federal standards and how to comply with them.
   The report, which was completed last November but not given wide
distribution by the department, said FSIS was ``unable to
successfully investigate pesticide violations in 79 percent of the
cases'' reviewed by the auditors. A violation was defined as an
illegal level of chemical residue found in a sample of meat or
poultry.
   Some of the reasons for the lack of success in investigating
violations included:
   _Tracing the illegal residue to the original producer was not
always successful.
   _Follow-up samples from suspected meat were seldom taken, or else
the suspected animals or carcasses were not always retained for
further checking.
   _Documentation of regulatory actions was insufficient.
   Starting in June 1986, when a company signed a memorandum of
understanding with FSIS, it agreed to upgrade its own quality
control procedures, was exempted from routine monitoring by the
agency and placed under a less-intensive monitoring program.
   ``In addition, these companies became eligible to make certain
claims on their product labels concerning (chemical) residue levels
or superior quality control procedures,'' the report said.
   By 1988, this ``verified production control'' program included 11
companies and 34 slaughter plants out of a U.S. total of 1,800
plants. The participating plants had an annual slaughter of about 5
billion pounds, or about 8 percent of all animals slaughtered last
year.
   In all, the agency is responsible for inspection in more than
7,000 meat and poultry slaughter and processing plants.
   The USDA investigators visited 96 federally inspected meat and
poultry plants and conducted research at the agency's national
office, three regional offices, three field laboratories and five
USDA-accredited laboratories.
   One of the major problems uncovered is the identification of the
original farmer, feedlot operator or other producer of livestock
that have been found to be in violation of the federal residue
levels.
   The report recommended that the agency seek legislation for
mandatory identification of the source of all animal species
slaughter for domestic food consumption. However, FSIS responded
that such a move be directed to policy-makers, not the regulatory
agency itself.
   Lester M. Crawford, FSIS administrator, said that historically
the agency has pursued animal identification as a related part of
the residue testing program.
   ``We recently were successful in obtaining a swine identification
program outside of the legislative route, and would strongly support
similar identification for the other species which come under our
jurisdiction,'' Crawford said in a response to the report.

   George Bush moved out of his vice presidential
mansion and closer to the White House today, lightheartedly joking
about ``big responsibilities being put on my shoulders'' as the
countdown to his inauguration officially got underway.
   The man who said he wanted to be the education president started
the day by vowing to make good on his promise. ``Education will be
on my desk and on my mind right from the start, every day,'' he said
in a speech to 250 teachers summoned from each state for the
inauguration.
   The teachers were nominated by home-state officials to represent
the best from America's schools. ``My most important message to
American teachers is a message of appreciation,'' Bush said. ``I am
awed by your work.''
   In a bow to the political operation that helped him win the White
House, Bush also planned to oversee the installation of his campaign
manager, Lee Atwater, as chairman of the Republican Party.
   He used the occasion _ a gathering of 500 GOP officials from
around the country _ to pay tribute to President Reagan.
   ``I don't believe I'd be standing here as president-elect of the
United States if it hadn't been for the way President Reagan treated
me as vice president and then the way he rolled up his sleeves and
went to work in many of your states helping his vice president be
elected.
   ``When I go say farewell to him tomorrow,'' Bush said, ``it won't
be too easy.''
   Bush will be sworn in as the nation's 41st president at 11:59
a.m. EST Friday, but the five-day celebration of his inauguration
begins today with an outdoor twilight pageant at the Lincoln
Memorial, complete with herald trumpets, fireworks and a flyover of
Navy combat jets.
   As inaugural guests flooded into hotels, building to an estimated
300,000 celebrants, Bush and his wife Barbara moved out of the
official residence they've occupied for the last eight years on the
grounds of the Naval Observatory off Massachusetts Avenue.
   Bush joked that he had been giving his wife ``a little elbow
room'' during the chaos of the move.
   ``She's getting tough around the house,'' said Bush. ``See a
half-filled crate and she puts me to work and she's mean and tough
and ugly about it. She doesn't show any understanding. And so she's
not here today.''
   ``I don't care if I see her for another 48 hours, because I know
there'll be another crate that she (will say): `Move this one over
here.' Getting tired of that. After all I got big responsibilities
being put on my shoulders,'' Bush said to gusts of laughter from the
crowd of Republican officials.
   Bush's temporary home, until he goes to the White House on
Friday, is the Blair House, the newly refurbished government guest
quarters across the street from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
   Bush's aides say the move will allow workers time to prepare the
vice president's residence for its new occupants, Dan Quayle and his
family, who will move in next month after renovations.
   The president-elect and his wife will not be lonely at Blair
House. Their five grown children and their spouses, along with 10
grandchildren, also were moving into the guest house. The whole clan
_ 22 in all _ will live together and then move en masse to the White
House on Friday where they'll all spend at least one night.
   About 100,000 people were expected for the opening ceremony at
the Lincoln Memorial, and the city was braced for traffic problems
in the evening rush hour. The first 40,000 celebrants were to
receive tiny flashlights with instructions to turn them on at one
point to highlight Bush's campaign theme of ``a thousand points of
light.''
   The most exclusive social event of the whole inaugural was
tonight's black-tie inaugural dinner, with tickets priced at $1,500
a plate. Yet, the demand was so heavy that organizers had to split
it up into three dinners at different sites, all being attended by
Bush.
   Advocates of the poor and homeless were staging a
counter-inaugural banquet at one of the dinner sites in protest of
the pricey tickets. Mitch Snyder, an activist for the poor,
challenged corporations that are underwriting the cost of Bush's
inauguration to contribute like amounts to house the homeless.
   Amid the swirl of events, Bush arranged a Blair House reunion
with World War II submarine crewmen who rescued him after the
Japanese downed his bomber in the Pacific in 1944. He also was
working to fill out high-level jobs in his administration.
   Industry and Republican sources said Bush planned to name Susan
Engeleiter, 36, a Wisconsin state senator who lost the race for a
U.S. Senate seat last November, as head of the Small Business
Administration.
   Bush met quietly on Tuesday with leaders of the Teamsters union,
which is the target of a Justice Department lawsuit alleging that it
is infiltrated by organized crime. Bush aides said the meeting,
which was not listed on Bush's schedule, was a thank-you for the
union's endorsement in the election, and that the lawsuit was not
discussed.

over an intimate hotel festooned with flags and bunting.
   ``Isn't it something,'' marveled one family member as she checked
into the flower-filled Jefferson Hotel, with its vaulted ceiling,
damask-covered love seats and imposing portrait of Thomas Jefferson.
``I've been laughing and crying all day.''
   The Bush's brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews and
cousins are occupying 90 of the hotel's 100 rooms this week. As they
arrived, weighed down with furs and formal wear, some of them
scheduled manicure and makeup appointments even before checking in.
   In addition to all the official glamour and pomp, the relatives
are throwing a few parties of their own. The family reunion will
culminate with a White House lunch for 250 relatives on Saturday,
the first full day the new president and first lady will spend in
their new home.
   The nomadic couple, billed as having moved 28 times in a 44-year
marriage, won't make their 29th move until Friday after Bush has
taken his oath of office. And their personal belongings aren't due
to arrive at the White House until Monday.
   But they left the vice presidential residence Wednesday for a
two-day transitional stay in Blair House, the government's quarters
for visiting dignitaries.
   ``Our house looks like yours do whenever you make a move,'' Bush
told a group of teachers, referring to the official residence on the
grounds of the U.S. Naval Observatory. ``It's a real wasteland out
there this morning.''
   Blair House, four connected rowhouses across Pennsylvania Avenue
from the White House, is designed to house 19 guests. The Bushes
will number 22, counting children, spouses, grandchildren and the
president-elect's mother Dorothy, 87.
   The whole crew will move to the White House with the first couple
on Friday and Bush's mother, only the 12th presidential mom to see
her son sworn in, will sleep in the Queen's Bedroom.
   Barbara Bush personally packed hundreds of boxes and decided
which belongings would go to the White House, which to Camp David,
which to the summer house in Kennebunkport and which into storage.
   ``We've got dots on everything,'' she told reporters last week,
referring to her system denoting which items are going where. The
move had been exciting but also ``agony,'' she said, ``maybe because
I'm tired.''
   Despite the two moves in the space of a week, ``I don't see that
they look at it as a strain,'' said Sondra Haley, a spokeswoman for
Mrs. Bush. ``They wanted to be with their family and there was no
way the vice president's residence could accomodate everybody.''
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, his wife Marilyn and their three
children are expected to move into the official residence early next
month. Renovations for the young family are not expected to be
complete by then, but the Secret Service is anxious to install them
there as soon as possible.
   They can't compete with the Bushes, but the Quayles are no
slouches in the relative department. Quayle put the latest count at
117 coming for the inauguration.
   ``I think some of them, we asked for their birth certificates,''
Quayle joked. ``They started calling up and saying `I am a relative
of the senator' and I said, `Oh?' So we were going to have a
genealogist check their birth certificate and the tree and all that.
   ``But no,'' he added hastily, ``we'll be glad to see them all.''
   According to Haley, the 200-plus Bush relatives are people the
president-elect and his wife have been in touch with over the years,
and many have been guests at the family's summer home in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   ``We get enormous strength from our family,'' Mrs. Bush said
during her session with reporters. ``Not just our children and
granchildren, but our brothers and sisters. It's always been like
that. And more so now.''

   Actor Kirk Douglas, a son of poor Russian
immigrants who ate more than one meal in soup kitchens, told Skid
Row's homeless that luck as much as talent lifted him out of poverty.
   ``I know what it's like to go without food,'' Douglas told the
approximately 300 people receiving free lunch Tuesday at the Los
Angeles Rescue Mission. ``You don't forget those things.''
   The 72-year-old actor, who has appeared in more than 70 films,
recounted his early hard times in ``The Ragman's Son,'' an
autobiography published last year. In the book Douglas recounts one
Thanksgiving when he had a quarter to his name and ate a turkey
dinner at the Salvation Army.
   He recalled Tuesday a New York City soup kitchen once turning him
away because it ran out of food.
   Later, he said, the breaks came that would lead to a successful
screen career.
   ``A lot of it is luck. It isn't all talent,'' he said.

months of the year, and that Senegal might be it.
   Ali, in Dakar since Sunday, spoke to reporters after meetings
with the ministers of tourism, finance and hydraulics.
   He said he plans some investment projects in Senegal and is
considering buying a hotel on the island of Goree, off Dakar, a main
point of embarkation for the African slaves once sent to America.
   Investment in a mineral water project is another possible
project, said government officials who requested anonymity. Ali told

   The nationally syndicated ``Sally Jessy
Raphael'' talk show may leave New Haven for a new haven.
   WTNH-TV Station Manager Lew Freifield said Tuesday that
discussions had been held about relocating the show closer to New
York because of travel problems for Raphael, who lives in
Westchester County, N.Y., and New York City.
   The talk show, shown on more than 90 stations nationwide, has
been taped at the downtown New Haven television station since June
1987.
   Raphael's weekly commute from New York to St. Louis was a major
reason for the show's relocation to New Haven from KSDK-TV in St.
Louis.
   The show's executive producer, Burt Dubrow, would not say why the
show is considering the move. But he denied it was because of the
hour-plus commute Raphael must make, and he discounted reports of
space, parking and audience problems at the ABC affiliate.
   Dubrow said the show is merely ``exploring all kinds of options''
that might be available when its contract to lease space and
production services from WTNH expires in June 1990.
   Dubrow and Freifield would not rule out a move before 1990.

   Jack Nicklaus may be a high-profile
golfer but he's a low-profile businessman.
   Nicklaus, dubbed the Golden Bear when he dominated professional
golf for more than two decades, since 1970 has been quietly amassing
a business empire that now has annual revenues of about $400 million.
   The company, called Golden Bear, has been receiving more of the
48-year-old golfer's attention as chronic back pain keeps him off
the professional golf circuit more and more frequently.
   ``It's kind of a bittersweet competition for Jack between the
business and golf,'' said Richard P. Bellinger, chief operating
officer of the North Palm Beach-based business.
   ``I still don't consider myself a businessman who grinds out the
deals. I think of my involvement as being more creative,'' said
Nicklaus, who won 89 pro golf titles from 1962 to 1988, including a
stunning win in the 1986 Masters Tournament. He still competes in
about 10 events a year.
   Golden Bear has five divisions, all of which conduct golf-related
business, from course design and instructional videos to developing
residential communities around golf courses.

   Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Pat Buttrom, Montie Montana and George
Gobel are among the celebrities scheduled to attend a Feb. 4

   He starred in more than two dozen westerns as well as the
mid-1950s TV series ``Frontier Doctor.'' He also narrated more than

   The bullet-proof shield to protect George Bush
when he takes the presidential oath of office Friday is in place.
The manhole covers along the parade route are welded shut. Virtually
every police agency in town has canceled all days off.
   Welcome to Washington, the inaugural city, where protestors are
ready to demonstrate for their own version of a ``kinder, gentler''
nation and authorities hope they're ready for whatever transpires.
   ``We intend to be everywhere,'' Lisa Fithian, a spokeswoman for
the Counter-Inaugural Coalition for a People's Agenda, told a news
conference Wednesday. ``We will be a reminder of the urgency of not
just a kinder, gentler nation but a kinder, gentler, less insulated
government.''
   But she said the coalition's 80 groups _ ranging from the Student
Coalition Against Apartheid and Racism to Environmental Action _
have agreed not to conduct any civil disobedience.
   Anyone going anywhere the first families might go will be checked
with metal detectors. That includes, for the first time, the 150,000
invited guests at the Capitol swearing-in ceremonies, even if
they'll be sitting hundreds of yards away.
   That bit of security has upset Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman
of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.
   ``Security is something that bothers me considerably,'' he said
Tuesday. ``We're a free and open nation insisting that those in the
inner circle go through megadetectors.''
   The west side of the Capitol, where Bush will take the oath, has
been secured for a week.
   Starting tonight, the Capitol itself will be off-limits to all
unauthorized people. Friday, all streets within a two-block radius
will be closed, with even members of Congress told not to use their
normal parking spaces on the Capitol grounds.
   Many security details remained secret even as the celebrations
got under way Wednesday.
   ``We certainly wouldn't want to give anyone who had harmful
intent any kind of advantage,'' said Secret Service spokesman Ken
Lynch.
   Reports on previous inaugurations have indicated that agents
carrying shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to protect against air
attack were on the Capitol roof.
   The agencies involved refused to say if that would be the case
this year, although Bob Buckhorn of the Federal Aviation
Administration noted that flying over the White House or the Capitol
is normally a violation of federal air regulations.
   Flying over those places during the inauguration ``would be an
extreme, gross violation,'' Buckhorn said. ``The Secret Service
frowns on those kinds of violations.''
   Bush will ride in an armored limousine along the parade route
from the Capitol to the White House after he takes the oath,
according to everyone willing to talk about it.
   But then, that's what all they said about President Carter before
he and his wife, Rosalynn, climbed out of their car and walked the
1{ miles down Pennsylvania Avenue in January 1977.
   Jody Powell, Carter's press secretary, said in a recent interview
that his boss told him about his plans a week before the
inauguration but that the news was ``very tightly held, for security
purposes.''
   ``What he told me at the time was the deal was the Secret Service
wasn't going to fight it as long as it was kept secret, but if word
got out ahead of time they'd be very opposed to it,'' Powell said.
   The Secret Service will be ready to protect Bush if he, too,
decides to stroll down the parade route, says spokesman Rich Adams.
But he admitted the agents would not be too happy about it.
   ``If we had our way, he would not leave the White House,'' Adams
said.
   Even from the White House, the new president will be able to see
protestors.
   A corner of Lafayette Park, across Pennsylvania Avenue from
Bush's new home, has been set aside for demonstrations ``to ensure
First Amendment rights,'' in the words of Park Police Capt. Michael
Barrett.
   Planning to protest along the parade route are the
Counter-Inaugural Coalition and its member groups as well as the
National Organization for Women, which has announced a silent
protest.
   Law enforcement agencies involved in security for the inaugural
ceremonies include the Secret Service, Capitol Police, the District
of Columbia police department, Metro transit police, Park Police,
Federal Protective Service and the District of Columbia National
Guard.

   President-elect Bush, filling out the senior
ranks of his administration, on Wednesday named Susan Engeleiter of
Wisconsin, who lost a U.S. Senate race last year, to head the Small
Business Administration and Georgia state lawmaker Paul D. Coverdell
to head the Peace Corps.
   They were among more than a dozen high-level posts announced by
Bush's transition office.
   Ms. Engeleiter, a member of the Wisconsin Senate, was defeated by
Democrat herbert H. Kohl last year in the election for the U.S.
Senate seat vacated by retiring Democrat William Proxmire. She is an
attorney and former teacher.
   Coverdell is the Republican leader of the Georgia Senate and is
president and chief executive officer of Coverdell and Co. of
Atlanta.
   Bush also announced his intention to nominate Bruce S. Gelb, vice
chairman of the board of directors of the Bristol-Myers Co., as
director of the United States Information Agency. Gelb is in now in
charge of Bristol-Myers' consumer products and health care groups.
   He also selected Fred M. Zeder III, who was a campaign and
transition adviser, to be president of the Overseas Private
Investment Corp. Zeder served from 1982 to 1987 as President
Reagan's representative for Micronesian Status Negotiations. Zeder
was an official in the Interior Department in the Ford
administration.
   Constance Barry Newman, a campaign aide in charge of rallying
support among minority groups, was chosen as director of the Office
of Personnel Management.
   Other announcements included:
   _William F. Diefenderfer III, a Washington lawyer, as deputy
director of the Office of Management and Budget.
   _Edwin L. Dale Jr. as OMB counselor and director of external
affairs. Dale is currently counselor to outgoing Commerce Secretary
William Verity and is a former director of public affairs for the
budget office.
   _Robert E. Grady as associate OMB director for natural resources,
energy and science. Grady was a speechwriter for Bush's campaign.
   _Janet Hale as associate OMB director for economics and
government. She is currently assistant secretary for budget and
programs in the Transportation Department.
   It also was announced that Craig L. Fuller, Bush's vice
presidential chief of staff and co-director of his transition
office, would join the Washington consulting firm of Wexler and
Reynolds. He will serve as the president of the firm, which is to be
renamed to Wexler-Reynolds-Fuller.

   Energy Secretary John Herrington today
officially named Texas as the site of the $5.9 billion
superconducting super collider project.
   ``Texas has been chosen as the site because it is the superior
site,'' Herrington told a ceremony at the Department of Energy
attended by Texas Gov. Bill Clements.
   Herrington had already declared, on Nov. 10, that Texas was the
``preferred site'' for the massive physics installation at which
scientists plan to explore the nature of matter and energy.
   The facility is to be called the Ronald Reagan Center for
High-Energy Physics.
   Despite protests from states that lost out in bids for the
project, Herrington signed a ``record of decision'' making the
choice official.
   The collider, a 53-mile tunnel in which subatomic particles can
be accelerated to high speeds, is to be built around the Texas city
of Waxahachie.
   Herrington's decision to make the Ellis County site official had
to wait 30 days following release of the DOE's final environmental
impact statement for the seven finalist states. Completion of that
statement hinged on the choice of a preferred site.
   Congress must still authorize construction of the super collider
and members are predicting a tough battle over funding this year.
   Democratic Sens. Paul Simon of Illinois and Dennis DeConcini of
Arizona are among those who have requested the General Accounting
Office to review the Energy Department's site selection process and
determine if the decision was based on politics over merit.
   DeConcini spokesman Bob Maynes said the GAO report is expected
sometime in February.
   ``We knew realistically our best hope for evaluating the DOE
decision was by Congress and not the administration. Our best hope
for a check on the process lies in the GAO report and action by
Congress to send the decision back to the drawing board,'' said
Simon spokesman David Carle.
   Last year, Congress agreed to spend $100 million on the super
collider, but decreed that none of the money be spent on
construction.
   President Reagan's budget for the next fiscal year recommends
$250 million for the collider, $90 million of that for research and
development and $160 million for initial construction.
   But President-elect Bush has not yet indicated whether he will go
along with the $250 million figure or if he favors authorizing
construction.

<TEXT>
   The mayor has been swamped with calls from
angry viewers of the television movie about AIDS victim Ryan White,
he said Wednesday.
   ``They've been calling giving us thunder,'' Robert F. Sargent
said.
   Sargent has received calls from as far away as Arizona and New
Hampshire, questioning him about the actions portrayed in ``The Ryan
White Story.''
   The movie, broadcast Monday night on ABC, starred George C.
Scott, Judith Light and Lukas Haas.
   It told the saga of White, a hemophiliac who was barred from
classes at Western Middle School in nearby Russiaville after he was
diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome in December
1984.
   Ryan and his family successfully took the school corporation to
court. They won another legal battle when some of his classmates'
parents tried to get an injunction keeping him out of school.
   The movie also depicted the harassment allegedly suffered by the
Whites during their legal struggle.
   Some Kokomo residents complained Tuesday that the movie left the
impression that their entire community was against Ryan and his
family.
   Sargent said many of the viewers who called his office also got
that impression.
   ``They wanted to know why we'd do what we did to Ryan,'' he said.
``I talked to each one and I think I turned a few heads.''
   Sargent, who was not mayor at the time of the dispute, said he
told the callers that many in the community _ including the local
ministerial alliance, newspaper editors and health officials _ had
supported Ryan's return to classes.
   Ryan, who is now 17, returned to school in 1986. He has since
moved to Cicero and attends Hamilton Heights High School.
   The A.C. Nielsen Co. estimated that 15 million viewers saw the
movie.

   Elliott Abrams, an architect of recent U.S.
policy toward Central America, is moving to the Heritage Foundation,
joining Edwin Meese III and other former Reagan administration
officials at the conservative Washington think tank, it was
announced Wednesday.
   Abrams, the assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, was point man on Capitol Hill in President Reagan's efforts
to secure money for the Contra guerrillas of Nicaragua. He turns 40
next Tuesday.
   Starting on Jan. 21, the day after Reagan leaves office, Abrams
will write and lecture on Latin American affairs, foundation
president Edwin Feulner Jr. said in a statement.
   Feulner held no full-time post in the Reagan administration, but
has served as chairman of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public
Diplomacy, advising Reagan on the conduct of American foreign policy.
   The most prominent former Reagan aide at Heritage is Meese, whose
conduct as attorney general was criticized in a Justice Department
report this week.
   Richard Allen, who resigned as Reagan's first national security
adviser in a flap over unreported gifts, is also a Heritage fellow,
directing the foundation's Asian studies center.
   Cheryl Rubin, a spokeswoman for Heritage, listed other former
Reagan administration officials at the foundation as Terrence
Scanlon, former head of the Consumer Products Safety Commission;
Charles Lichenstein, alternate representative to the United Nations,
1981-84; Kenneth Cribb, assistant to the Reagan for domestic
affairs; Kate Walsh O'Brien, deputy assistant secretary for Health
and Human Services; Roger Brooks, head of planning for the State
Department's bureau of international orgnizations; and Charles
Heatherly, director of the president's commission on White House
fellowships.
   Abrams, an attorney, joined the administration as assistant
secretary of state for international organization affairs in 1981,
then took over the human rights portfolio before assuming his
current postion in 1985.
   Formerly, he worked for Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., and
the late Sen. Henry Jackson, D-Wash.

   Stunned elementary school students
returned to classes today, one day after a young drifter with a
rifle opened fire on a schoolyard jammed with laughing children,
killing five and wounding 30 before committing suicide.
   Patrick Edward Purdy, wearing a military flak jacket and
earplugs, killed himself with a bullet to the head after firing up
to 110 rounds from a Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifle at hundreds
of youngsters on recess Tuesday at Cleveland Elementary School. The
five slain were children of refugees from Southeast Asia.
   Purdy, who had a long criminal record, attended the school from
kindergarten through third grade, from 1969 to 1973, school
officials said today.
   There was no apparent motive in the shootings.
   As children returned to their campus today, they were greeted by
bouquets atop the school sign on the front lawn and five red roses
at its base. Across the street, a 3-foot-by-9-foot paper sign read,
``Racists Are Ugly _ Let's Stop Them.''
   There was no indication that racism was involved in the attack.
   ``I'm shocked. It's just horrible,'' said Purdy's grandmother,
63-year-old Julia Chumbley of nearby Lodi. ``I don't understand why
and I probably won't ever know why.''
   Purdy, 26, who most recently listed his grandmother's address as
home, began his assault shortly before noon when he parked his
station wagon behind the school. The car burst into flames in a fire
possibly set as a diversion, said Deputy Police Chief Lucian Neely.
   Then the 5-foot-11, 140-pound killer entered the campus through a
hole in a fence with the bayonet-equipped semi-automatic and two
handguns and walked to several portable classrooms about 250 yards
from the main, L-shaped building. He opened fire from the west side
of the portable buildings, then moved to the east side and continued
spraying the screaming children before turning his 9mm handgun on
himself.
   Police Capt. Dennis Perry said the gunman wore a flak jacket and
jeans. On his shirt were the words, ``Death to the great Satin,'' an
apparent reference to Satan and a phrase used by Iranian
fundamentalists to refer to the United States. The FBI was trying to
determine if Purdy had a military background.
   During a search of Purdy's motel room, police found about 100
plastic toy soldiers, tanks and jeeps spread across the floor in
formations, Perry said.
   ``Obviously he had a military hangup of some kind,'' Perry said.
   Mary Gonzales, superintendent of the Stockton Unified School
District, said psychiatrists, counselors and bilingual volunteers
wearing yellow armbands were on hand when classes began this morning.
   ``The main focus of our efforts is going to be on counseling,''
she said on CBS' `This Morning.''
   ``He was just standing there with a gun, making wide sweeps,''
recalled Lori Mackey, who teaches deaf students in one of the
portable classrooms at the school about 80 miles southeast of San
Francisco.
   ``He was not talking, he was not yelling, he was very
straight-faced, it did not look like he was really angry,'' she
said. ``It was just matter-of-factly.
   ``There was mass chaos. There were kids running in every
direction.''
   Purdy, who also was known as Patrick West and Eddie Purdy West,
had an ``extensive criminal record,'' said Neely. Many of the crimes
were committed in the Los Angeles area and included soliciting for
sex and narcotics and weapons violations, Neely said.
   The dead children were shot in the schoolyard and two were
dragged inside by fleeing teachers, he said.
   As police cleaned up the carnage, a large handgun and the assault
rifle were seen lying on the ground near a pool of blood. Written on
the pistol's handle was the word ``Victory.'' The letters SSA were
printed on the rifle's clip in letters 1{ inches long.
   Police said the word ``Hezbollah,'' the name of a Shiite Moslem
terrorist organization, was carved on one side of Purdy's rifle, and
the word ``Freedom'' on the other, Perry said.
   ``It suggests that this guy may have had delusions of grandeur
about Iran,'' Perry said.
   Th assault rifle Purdy used apparently was purchased in Oregon in
August, authorities said. It is a Soviet design, but Chinese
replicas are available in many gun stores for around $300. It is
capable of firing about 40 rounds per minute.
   A semi-automatic rifle can be purchased easily in Oregon, without
even the five-day waiting period required for a handgun, if the
buyer signs a federal form stating he has never been convicted of a
serious crime or indicted, among other requirements, said Bob Imel,
a Salem, Ore., gun shop owner.
   ``You use it for one purpose and one purpose only _ to kill a
human being,'' said Los Angeles Police Lt. Fred Nixon.
   The torched car was registered to Patrick E. Purdy, who lived
with an aunt and uncle from July through October in Sandy, Ore.
   ``She told me he was a loner and as a child he was an
alcoholic,'' Sandy Police Chief Fred Punzel said of his conversation
with the aunt, Julie Michael.
   Punzel said Michael told him Purdy left Oregon for a job as a
boilermaker in Texas. That job fell through and he went to Memphis,
Tenn. The aunt and uncle last heard from him at Thanksgiving, when
he was in Connecticut, Punzel said.
   ``He seemed like a real nice young man,'' said next-door neighbor
Pat Thomas, 45, who met Purdy in Sandy last summer. ``He was here
looking for work.''
   Purdy's father, Patrick Benjamin Purdy, was a Vietnam veteran who
was killed in a traffic accident in September 1981. Purdy's parents
married in Stockton; they later were divorced and his mother
retained custody.
   Purdy began drifting about 10 years ago, criss-crossing the
nation looking for work, his grandmother said. He visited her
occasionally and used her address to receive mail.
   Neely identified the dead students as Raphanar Or, 9, a boy; and
girls Ram Chun, 8; Thuy Tran, 6, Sokhim An, 6, and Oeun Lim, 8. All
were children of refugee families from Southeast Asia. Southeast
Asian pupils make up about 60 percent of the school's enrollment of
1,000 pupils in grades kindergarten through 6th grade.
   The wounded included 29 pupils. The most seriously injured was a
6-year-old boy who was shot in the groin. He was listed in serious
condition; a teacher and 17 pupils were listed as stable, hospital
officials said Tuesday night. The others either were treated at the
scene or at hospitals and released.
   Pupil Ramon Billedo III described seeing a schoolmate shot. ``I
just saw him fall down,'' he said. ``His head hit the ground. The
teacher grabbed him and dragged him inside the other classroom.''
   ``Some kids were outsideand some man came over here shooting like
crazy. A few kids got shot,'' said Ricardo Rivera, 10, a
fifth-grader.
   ``They were shooting at my classroom and at (Rivera's) classroom
at reading time,'' said another pupil, Roberto Costa. ``The bullets
were hitting the walls. Everybody got scared.''
   Tragically, schools have been frequent targets of similar attacks.
   On Sept. 26, a man walked into Oakland Elementary School in
Greenwood, S.C., and opened fire in a crowded cafeteria and in a
third-grade classroom. Two 8-year-old girls were killed, and nine
people were wounded. Jamie Wilson, 19, was charged with murder and
is in jail awaiting trial.
   On May 20, Laurie Dann attacked the Hubbard Woods Elementary
school in Winnetka, Ill., killing one 8-year-old boy and wounding
five children. Dann fled to a nearby home, wounding a man inside and
shooting herself to death.

   Prison inmates have no right to challenge or
have explained to them prohibitions on having visitors, a lawyer for
Kentucky's prison system told the Supreme Court Wednesday.
   A decision to bar visitors is one of the ``daily management
problems'' prison officials deal with that do not give rise to any
special rights for inmates, state lawyer Barbara Willett Jones of
Frankfort, Ky., argued.
   But Joseph Elder II, a Louisville lawyer representing inmates,
contended that Kentucky's prison visitation program created a
``liberty interest'' for inmates that cannot be infringed on without
due process.
   ``The right arises out of ... regulations in place,'' Elder said.
   The high court is expected to announce a decision in the case by
July. Its ruling likely will affect prison visitation policies in
many states.
   Thirty-two other states are supporting Kentucky's appeal, urging
the justices to clarify what rights, if any, inmates have in such
cases.
   A federal appeals court ruled for the inmates, but did not say
what kind of due process _ perhaps a written explanation or some
type of hearing _ is required when visits are prohibited.
   The Kentucky controversy dates back to a lawsuit inmates of the
Kentucky State Reformatory in LaGrange filed over conditions there.
   The suit resulted in a 1980 consent decree in which the state
agreed, among other things, to continue its ``open visitation
policy.''
   State officials subsequently adopted guidelines and procedures
for handling prison visits.
   In 1985, after several inmates complained about being barred from
having visitors, a class-action lawsuit was filed in behalf of all
the prison's inmates. The suit contended that suspension of
visitation privileges without a due-process hearing was unlawful.
   Mrs. Jones asked the justices to ``draw a line between those
procedures which affect the daily operations of a prison from those
which affect the length or nature of confinement'' when requiring
states to give inmates due process.
   She said denial of visitation privileges does not rise to the
level of affecting length or nature of confinement _ and therefore
should not give rise to any due-process right.
   Several members of the high court seemed dubious.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, noting that some might say seeing
visitors ``is vitally important to a prisoner's existence,'' said
the distinction Mrs. Jones sought ``is not an easy line to draw.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist complained that ``your line
seems so wavy,'' and Justice Antonin Scalia asked, ``Is it a line
that makes any sense?''
   When Justice John Paul Stevens asked whether providing inmates
with a written explanation for denied visitation would be a big
administrative burden, Mrs. Jones said it would not.
   But she said creation of such a due-process right would leave all
prison officials open to civil rights lawsuits alleging violation of
that right.
   The case is Kentucky Department of Corrections vs. Thompson,
87-1815.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary-designate Jack Kemp pledged
Wednesday to ``throw out ideology'' and be an advocate for helping
ease poverty, homelessness and other urban problems.
   Kemp won praise from big-city mayors in his first public
appearance before them since his selection by President-elect Bush
as secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
   ``I am going to be an activist,'' Kemp said. ``I'm going to be an
advocate. The door is open. My mind is open.''
   He spoke to the U.S. Conference of Mayors as the group held its
annual winter meeting in Washington. He promised to visit many of
their cities and to meet again with the organization once he is
confirmed by the Senate.
   Kemp, a conservative who unsuccessfully sought the Republican
presidential nomination, drew applause from the mayors when he
described himself as ``a bleeding heart conservative'' and ``a
progressive conservative.''
   ``I'm going to throw the labels out. We're going to throw out
ideology,'' he said.
   He added, ``I want to be considered a big-L liberal'' on race,
poverty, and relations between mayors and his department.
   Kemp referred briefly to federal budget constraints but spoke
enthusiastically about working with the mayors, whose complaints
about cuts in federal aid to cities have been a constant refrain
during the Reagan administration. He also noted his support for tax
cuts that some critics blame for cutbacks in domestic spending.
   ``I've long been associated with the tax reform, but it went to
far when it comes to affordable low- and moderate-income housing,''
Kemp said. ``But I'm speaking for Kemp now. I'm not speaking for the
administration.''
   Kemp cited his support for urban enterprize zones, which
encourage jobs and development in targeted inner cities with tax
breaks and other incentives. He listened as mayors described
problems in their cities caused by a shortage of affordable housing
and cuts in federal housing aid and other programs.
   ``I want you to know from the bottom of my heart I am really
excited about this, and I have a mandate from the president-elect to
pursue many of the things you've mentioned,'' he said.
   Kemp was widely praised by the mayors, who have had only limited
meetings with the HUD secretary throughout Reagan's two terms,
Samuel Pierce. Pierce was not scheduled to have a farewell meeting
with the mayors during their three-day meeting.
   ``This is the type of enthusiasm we have waited for for a long
time,'' said Mayor Jessie Ratley of Newport News, Va. ``We have
prayed for it.''

<HEAD>Catholicism Enlists Credit Cards For Charity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Roman Catholicism's social-service arm,
Catholic Charities, on Wednesday launched a system of raising money
to help the needy through credit cards.
   The plan is called ``Project Caritas,'' Latin for generous love.
   Half of 1 percent of the amount charged on a specially endorsed
``Caritas Mastercard'' credit card will be channeled by
participating banks to the church's work among the deprived.
   The Rev. Thomas J. Harvey of Washington, D.C., executive director
of Catholic Charities USA, called it a ``creative way'' of
bolstering efforts at ``lessening human suffering.''
   ``It will help us in our mission of protecting human dignity,''
he said.
   The plan was described at a news conference as the first of its
kind by a major national religious organization.
   However, other non-profit groups, devoted to such causes as the
environment, college alumni associations or higher education, also
participate in such ``affinity'' credit card programs.
   Officials at the news conference said the National Conference of
Synagogue Youth also has begun such a program, and others are being
considered by the Salvation Army and Young Men's Christian
Association.
   Catholic Charities embraces a nationwide network of branches
helping about 7 million people annually at a cost of about $1
billion.
   Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Sullivan of Brooklyn, representing U.S.
bishops, termed the new plan a ``very responsible way'' to raise
money and to ``get the message out'' of aid to the homeless, hungry,
sick, children and other needy.
   Harvey estimated that at least 20,000 people would use the new
card the first year, increasing to 250,000 in five years, when it
would funnel an estimated $4 million a year into church charities.
That estimate was based on the average annual spending per card of
$l,800.
   The ``Caritas Mastercard'' is being marketed by a bankcard
organization, Magna Carda Inc., of Alexandria, Va., with two issuing
banks: State Street Bank and Trust of Boston and First Financial
Savings Association of Milwaukee.
   ``We're pleased to be involved with this kind of project,'' said
Scott Brown of the Boston institution. ``It should have mass appeal
because of the purpose that it goes for.''
   Harvey emphasized that the church didn't want to promote ``credit
dependency'' and would not benefit from interest on deferred payment
of charges. ``We are not encouraging debt,'' he said.
   Noting that Catholic charities serve the needy without regard to
creed with 75 percent of help going to non-Catholics, he said the
card was being promoted ecumenically among ``all people of good
will.''
   Returns from the card program are to be divided 30 percent
locally, 30 percent nationally for training leadership, and 40
percent for work among troubled youth and AIDS victims.

   Canadian immigration officials said
Wednesday they will ``look the other way'' until a Cuban man and his
family exhausts efforts to return to their home in Miami.
   Milt Best, a spokesman for Employment and Immigration Canada,
said that although Carlos Fajardo and his family are technically
illegal aliens in Canada, officials will not move against them while
they continue talks with U.S. immigration authorities.
   ``We will let them stay until we see what happens next,'' Best
said.
   Canadian officials had issued the Fajardos a temporary visa that
expired Sunday.
   The family has been stranded at a Niagara Falls, Ontario, motel
since Dec. 23, when they crossed into Canada to view the falls and
were prevented from returning after falsely claiming U.S.
citizenship.
   Hispanic groups and U.S. Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., have pleaded
with U.S. immigration officials to allow the family to return on
humanitarian grounds. But authorities have refused, saying Fajardo's
wife, Bermaida, has a history of immigration fraud.
   Fajardo had an application for asylum pending, but by leaving the
country the application was nullified, officials said.
   Roderick McDowall, a Canadian attorney representing the family,
said he expects some new efforts to readmit the family will begin
next week.
   McDowall said Fajardo will submit a new application for asylum
and hope that if he is granted refugee status his wife and her two
children will be allowed to return as well.
   Fajardo owns a home and small boat building business in Miami. He
entered the country illegally in 1985 from Panama.
   Farjardo's wife and her children by a previous marriage entered
the country illegally in 1986 from Venezuela. A U.S. immigration
judge ordered the family deported last August.

   Jimmy Carter had the ``killer rabbit'' to contend
with and Jerry Ford was perceived as prone to bumping his head on
helicopter doors. But after all these years, the two former
presidents say they don't know why they got such lousy press.
   ``Presidents Nixon, Johnson, Ford and I had bad relations with
the press. Reagan had good relations,'' said Carter on Wednesday.
``Why, I don't know.''
   Carter and Ford took part in a discussion at Columbia University
on ``The Press, the Presidency and the First Hundred Days.'' They
agreed that when it comes to relations with the news media, George
Bush will find Ronald Reagan a hard act to follow.
   Reagan was treated with kid gloves by the press, Ford said. And
Carter thinks Reagan got away with staying aloof from tough issues _
``a tribute to his acuity.''
   Carter said he had unsuccessful relationships with the press. He
said he spent weeks trying to deflect attention from a story that a
rabbit had swum out to his boat as he was fishing and that he had to
beat it back with oars.
   ``How can you control something like that?'' Cartr asked. The
rabbit story, he said, ``gave an image of an incompetent president
who could not even protect himself against a rabbit.''
   He said that Ford ``was the best athlete ever in the White
House'' but that Ford was dogged by stories about his golf balls
hitting bystanders and his clumsiness generally. ``It hurt him
politically,'' Carter said.
   Ford said news people who accompanied him on ski trips to Vail
fell as much on the slopes as he did ``but nobody took pictures of
them.''
   The images are hurtful, he said, but ``it's part of what they
think the public wants.''
   Ford said that when Bush takes the oath of office this week he
will start out with the best atmosphere, since relations between the
press and Reagan in recent weeks have been pleasant.

   George Sleeman, the kingpin in what is
considered the most widespread case of public corruption in Vermont
history, was sentenced Wednesday to a minimum of two years in jail.
   Judge Francis McCaffrey sentenced the former Bennington school
superintendent to jail terms of three to seven years on each count,
the terms to be served concurrently, with a minimum of two years
behind bars.
   Sleeman, 58, was convicted last fall of eight counts of
embezzlement and one count of false swearing, all stemming from
allegations he used school money for personal uses.
   McCaffrey ordered Sleeman to make $8,425 in restitution and to
perform 1,000 hours of community service.
   Prosecutors had urged McCaffrey to give Sleeman five to 10 years
in jail, while Sleeman's lawyer argued for no jail term, saying his
client had suffered enough.
   Sleeman was convicted of embezzling $4,285 in rent checks from
two school bank accounts for building space he leased, and of lying
about the rent checks during a February 1986 inquest into the
Bennington school scandal.
   His conviction came in the first of four trials he faces on a
series of charges that were prompted by the discovery in 1984 of a
$2 million deficit in the Bennington School District.
   In all, Sleeman is charged with embezzling $20,000 and a car. He
has yet to be tried on 21 embezzlement counts and three counts of
false swearing stemming from state inquests in which he allegedly
lied about his use of school funds.
   Four former top-ranking school officials have been punished for
their part in the scandal, though none has received jail time.

<HEAD>GAO Says Pentagon Has Ambitious Schedule for Rail Garrison System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department has an ambitious
schedule for developing a rail garrison system for the MX missile,
according to a congressional agency report that says there could be
cost and performance problems if the program is not closely
supervised.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigating arm of Congress,
said in a report this week that the department's acquisition
strategy for the rail garrison system calls for the start of
production two years before development contracts have been
completed.
   This overlap between production and development, known as
concurrency, must be ``well planned and controlled,'' the GAO said,
otherwise, ``it can cause cost, schedule and performance problems,
as demonstrated in other Air Force acquisition programs.''
   In addition, the GAO said that by March 1990, when the department
must make an initial production decision on the rail garrison, only
about two years of the system's planned four-year test program will
have been completed.
   ``Most systems integration testing, all basing verification
missile flight tests, and most of the operational test and
evaluation effort will remain to be done,'' said the GAO.
   The Defense Department, in comments included in the GAO report,
concurred with all of the agency's findings. It added that the
department believes the system of launching missiles from the rails
is similar to silo launches and does not require special tests.
   Under the rail garrison system, 50 missiles would be placed on 25
trains that would be parked inside train alert shelters in garrisons
at Air Force bases around the country. In the event of a threat, the
trains, each carrying two missiles, would move onto the nation's
railroad tracks.
   The Air Force estimates that acquisition cost for the rail
garrison system is about $7.4 billion.
   Congress approved $440 million for research and development of
the rail garrison program in fiscal 1987 and 1988, and appropriated
$600 million in fiscal 1989. However, the Pentagon can only spend
$250 million on the MX rail garrison before Feb. 15, according to
the Department of Defense authorization bill for fiscal 1989.
   The Feb. 15 date is the deadline for the president to decide what
to do with the remainder of the funds.
   Under the system, the trains will be deployed initially at F.E.
Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, and at up to 10 other possible Air
Force installations.

   OK, so the thief kept the cash stolen from
Rufus Edmisten's car. But he returned items that the North Carolina
secretary of state considered far more valuable _ Watergate
memorabilia and two Super Bowl tickets.
   Someone entered Edmisten's unlocked, state-owned Chevrolet in
Raleigh Saturday and stole a briefcase, a raincoat and $500 to $700.
Edmisten reported the theft to police.
   But on Monday morning, Edmisten found that all the items except
the money had been placed in the back seat of his Toyota in front of
his house.
   ``The only thing I can figure is someone looked in there and
said, `Oh my God, it's Rufus' _ I'd better give this back to him.
But I need the money,''' Edmisten said.
   The briefcase that was returned contained mementos from
Edmisten's days working for Sen. Sam J. Ervin, D-N.C., on the Senate
committee that investigated the Watergate scandal, including a
subpoena that Edmisten served on President Nixon demanding that he
turn over the infamous White House tapes.
   The leather case also contained about 30 family photographs,
irreplaceable state documents, and _ last but not least _ two
round-trip airline tickets to Miami and two tickets to Sunday's
Super Bowl.
   ``I fully expected I would never hear of this briefcase again,''
Edmisten said. ``I was heartbroken about the briefcase.''

   A wandering rooster that was picked up as
a fowl-at-large and served time in the pen has been adopted and will
star on a radio show.
   Dog Pound Director Larry Cole said even if the law does instruct
his workers to pick up ``chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys or other
domestic fowl'' running loose, ``we're going to make this our last
rooster.''
   The as-yet-unnamed rooster caused a ruckus during its three-week
stay in the pound when dogs howled at its crowing. The Metro Health
Department auctioned off the bird Tuesday to cover the costs of the
dog food it ate.
   The bidding began at $6 but rapidly increased to $13.50 before
WKDJ disc jockey Carl P. Mayfield, one of the bidders, urged James
W. Peach of Madison, the other, ``to cut a deal.''
   Peach, who said his children wanted the bird because their
8-year-old pet rooster died last year, agreed to let the fowl make
guest appearances on the show as the ``official Rock 103.3 KDF
rooster.''
   The final gavel price was $14. Mayfield said he planned a contest
to name the bird.

   In the case of the American 1989 Kangchenjunga Expedition, two
tons of goods ranging from tents, rope and other climbing and
camping gear to footstuffs that included cases of candy bars, Spam,
salamis, peanut butter and canned beans and franks.
   ``My favorite are Snickers,'' said expedition leader Lou

   Whittaker said Tuesday the group would make its assault on the
north face while a group of 48 Russians heads up from the south. The
Americans hoped to meet the Russians at the summit by early May and
exchange toasts of vodka and scotch, he said.

   As a prologue to the broader governmental

at the Republican National Committee with the election of tough
infighter Lee Atwater as party chairman.
   ``He will be my political eyes and ears,'' said the
president-elect during a brief appearance at a Republican luncheon
shortly after Atwater's election.
   With ties to Bush that go back to 1973 when the president-elect
was party chairman, Atwater appeared certain to shift political
influence from the White House staff to the party headquarters
across town.
   During Ronald Reagan's presidency, political decisions were made
by such White House aides as Lyn Nofziger and Ed Rollins.
   After his unanimous election to the chairmanship, Atwater told
the RNC that Republican must begin ``reaching into communities where
the Republican message has not yet found a home.
   ``Face it: We have been fighting with one arm tied behind our
back _ because the Democrats have succeeded in virtually cornering
the votes of whole segments of American society.''
   Atwater said blacks, Hispanics, Asians and disabled Americans
``have not historically been part of our coalition'' and added, ``we
must invite these Americans into our party's councils.''
   Bush endorsed the idea, saying, ``I like the concept that our
party needs to have a broader base, a stronger participation.''
   Atwater and Bush made their appeals to a 165-member body that,
according to a RNC aide, has only two black members, both from the
Virgin Islands.
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle referred to Atwater's reputation
as a tough political gut-fighter and, joking, said the new chairman
was ``tough, tenacious, a real fighter. He'll fit right in making
this party kinder and gentler.''
   Also speaking briefly was former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu,
Bush's choice for White House chief of staff.
   Sununu said, ``I come to this job from outside the (Washington)
Beltway. ... There are some who consider that an impediment. I
accept their judgment in that respect. I will do my best to learn
what I have to do as chief of staff.''
   But, he went on to say that his experience outside the Beltway
gave him a better sense of ``the critical nature of the political
structures back home.''
   Atwater's predecessor, Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., held the
chairmanship for six years, the longest tenure this century.
   His parting message emphasized the need for Republicans to
control the process by which legislative district lines will be
redrawn, on the state and federal level, to conform with population
shifts determined in the 1990 Census.
   In 1981, Republicans sought to control redistricting with a heavy
investment in computers. But Democrats controlled more governorships
and state legislatures and they won the day.
   The same situation threatens to occur in 1991 unless Republican
overcome the current Democratic edge in state politics.
   Fahrenkopf pointed out that 98 percent House incumbents running
for re-election in 1988 were victorious _ a return rate he said was
higher than that for members of the Supreme Soviet.
   But the part of Fahrenkopf's speech that drew the most attention
from committee members was his outline of the arrangements to
getting members to various events connected with the Bush
inauguration.
   ``I remind you,'' he told them ``there is no food at inaugural
balls. This is not a dinner, folks.''

   East-bloc foreign ministers at a forum on
human rights Wednesday defended the Berlin Wall, Czechoslovakia's
crackdown on dissent and Romania's suggestion it may not abide by
the 35-nation accord.
   Polish and Hungarian officials promised greater freedom in their
nations, but envoys of other countries in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
stuck to positions that long have divided East and West.
   The human rights agreement calls for greater freedom of religion,
travel and emigration for East-bloc citizens. It also mandates new
arms control talks, beginning March 9, between NATO and the Warsaw
Pact to reduce the number of troops and tanks in Europe.
   Foreign ministers of the nations involved in the accord are in
Vienna for the concluding session of the conference, which began in
1986.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze brushed off
suggestions that the Berlin Wall be torn down as a gesture of
socialist commitment to the freer movement called for in the accord.
   He said the wall was not a subject for the Vienna Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Foreign Minister Jaromir Johanes of Czechoslovakia, in a speech,
rebutted Western denunciations of the way authorities in Prague have
put down recent demonstrations.
   ``Anyone in this hall who wants to point the finger at other
nations, including Czechoslovakia, should first of all look at
himself,'' Johanes said.
   He later mentioned the racial unrest in Miami as the kind of
problem troubling other nations.
   On Tuesday, riot police in Prague broke up crowds for the third
straight day and chased hundreds of youths with water cannons and
truncheons.
   Authorities used tear gas, batons, dogs and water cannons to
disperse 5,000 demonstrators who gathered Sunday to remember Jan
Palach, a Czech student who burned himself to death in January 1969
to protest the Soviet-led invasion of his homeland five months
earlier.
   ``What is happening in Prague is not a violation of human
rights,'' Johanes said in an interview with Austrian radio.
   Human rights activists in the East German city of Leipzig also
were arrested over the weekend after they tried to stage a protest.
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and British Foreign
Secretary Geoffrey Howe on Tuesday denounced the crackdowns.
   In a speech Wednesday, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher said that what had ``occurred in the last few days against
peaceful demonstrators in Prague and Leipzig cannot be allowed to be
repeated.''
   Foreign Ministers Peter Varkonyi of Hungary and Tadeusz
Olechowski of Poland said their governments will work to ensure the
provisions of the accord are carried out.
   ``We shall review the existing legislation to see whether it is
consistent with these new recommendations and, where it is not, to
introduce the necessary amendments,'' Olechowski said. ``We shall
expect similar moves by other states.''
   Romania, however, has drawn criticism from Western nations for
suggesting that it did not necessarily feel bound by the accord.
   ``Some of the provisions in the final document which have been
introduced in the name of concern for free movement or personal
religious freedoms depart from the ... realities and needs of our
times,'' said Foreign Minister Ioan Totu.
   Shevardnadze praised the accord as a sign of ``a qualitatively
new situation in Europe,'' but repeated the socialist bloc's
position that the Berlin Wall and other borders are matters of
national sovereignty.
   ``Each state has the right to build its frontiers as it wishes,
and we must proceed from there,'' he said.

   Diplomats said Wednesday they see little
hope of breaking a deadlock in Iran-Iraq peace talks when a U.N.
envoy visits the region next week, but they were optimistic the
exchange of war prisoners will resume.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is sending his
representative, Swedish U.N. Ambassador Jan. K. Eliasson, to Baghdad
and Tehran in an effort to prod Iraq and Iran into showing some
flexibility.
   Their nearly eight-year war ground to a halt Aug. 20 after both
sides accepted a cease-fire, but peace talks that opened five days
later immediately stalemated.
   The cease-fire resolution calls on both countries to halt all
military activities; withdraw their troops to the border; exchange
about 100,000 war prisoners; and begin peace talks.
   Iraq still occupies 259 square miles of Iranian territory and
says it will not withdraw until Iran gives up the right to search
ships for war cargo bound for Iraq. It considers that a military
activity.
   Iran, which has not stopped any Iraqi-bound ships since the
cease-fire began, says the withdrawal to the border must be the next
step in the peace process.
   U.N. officials and diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity,
did not foresee the likelihood of Tehran or Baghdad budging from
those positions but said progress was possible on the exchange of
sick or injured POWs and other technical measures.
   Iran and Iraq recently allowed the United Nations to begin direct
flights between the two nations, a U.N. official said.
   Previously, the two nations distrusted each other so intensely
that even U.N. diplomats had to fly to a third country to travel
between them.
   The United Nations has also received ``expressions of interest''
from both sides in resuming the exchange of POWS, the U.N. official
said.
   Last year, the International Committee of the Red Cross worked
out a plan for the registration of all POWs and the exchange of sick
or injured POWs, but the arrangement broke down after only a few
dozen had been exchanged.
   A U.N. official said Iran and Iraq appear ready to initiate
direct contacts between their military officers to work out their
frequent complaints about technical violations of the cease-fire and
other military matters.
   ``We hope to achieve movement, some sense of progress'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He also hoped for progress on substantial issues, including the
impasse over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway forming the border between
Iran and Iraq, but noted ``these are matters of deeper pride.''
   Iraq and Iran shared use of the Shatt-al-Arab under a 1975
treaty. It is Iraq's only deep-water access to the Persian Gulf.
Iraq has repudiated the treaty and said another accord should be
worked out under which the two nations would share use of the
waterway.
   It suggested the United Nations oversee the dredging of the
Shatt-al-Arab, but Iran has refused to go along with that unless
Iraq recognizes the 1975 treaty.

   A brother of one of three voting
rights workers killed in Mississippi in 1964 is unhappy with the
re-enactment of the slayings in the film ``Mississippi Burning.''
   ``The movie is terribly dishonest and very racist,'' said Stephen
Schwerner, whose brother Michael was one of the victims. ``It
terribly distorts the realities of 1964.''
   The executive director of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People agreed. ``Mississippi Burning''
rewrites history and ``reeks with dishonesty, deception and fraud,''
Benjamin Hooks said in a statement issued Wednesday from NAACP
headquarters in Baltimore.
   ``Blacks in the film are portrayed as cowed, submissive and
blank-faced. They are used as a backdrop when in reality they were
the principals. This is a gross libel on the many black
Mississippians who, even knowing they could be murdered with
impunity and nothing would ever be done, still sought time and time
again the right to vote,'' Hooks said.
   Schwerner, 51, dean of students at Antioch College in this
southwest Ohio community, said Tuesday he is less concerned about
the historical accuracy of the movie than he is about its depictions
of blacks and federal officials.
   He said the movie portrays blacks as passive spectators in the
civil rights movement in the South and the FBI as a champion of
civil rights.
   ``In general, the FBI was an enemy of the civil rights
movement,'' said Schwerner, who was a member of the Congress of
Racial Equality and active in civil rights demonstrations in New
York City and during his college days in Yellow Springs.
   ``They had to be dragged into the case kicking and screaming by
Lyndon Johnson, and only then because two of the victims were
white,'' Schwerner said.
   Hooks said it was unconscionable to depict the FBI as the good
guys.
   ``Under J. Edgar Hoover, who despised blacks and despised most
expecially Dr. Martin Luther King, the FBI was not a friend of
blacks, but an enemy who spied on the movement and was not above
using its own bag of dirty tricks.
   Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney disappeared in
Neshoba County, Miss., after they were arrested and jailed briefly
for speeding on June 21, 1964, while they were trying to gather
information on a church bombing. Their bodies were found buried in
an earthen dam about two months later.
   Seven people, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted of
conspiracy charges in connection with the slayings.
   The movie's director, Alan Parker, has emphasized that
``Mississippi Burning'' is fiction. But Schwerner said so many
details of the film are factual _ even down to the Ku Klux Klan
nickname for his brother, ``Goatee'' _ that the distinction between
fact and fiction is intentionally blurred. And that makes the larger
distortions that much more disturbing, he said.
   ``There are black kids and white kids who are going to see that
movie and will walk out believing that the FBI was the moving force
behind the civil rights movement and behind the destruction of the
KKK, and that's just grossly dishonest,'' Schwerner said. ``It's
like reading in some history books that all blacks were perfectly
happy on slave plantations.''
   The FBI secretly tapped Schwerner's parents' phone following his
brother's disappearance at the age of 24, he said.
   Through the Freedom of Information Act, Schwerner recently
obtained a copy of a letter from Hoover to Attorney General Robert
Kennedy requesting the wiretap, Schwerner said. Hoover suspected the
disappearances may have been a hoax and publicity stunt, he said.

   About 5,000 people filled Wenceslas
Square again Wednesday chanting ``Freedom!'' ``Truth!'' and ``Human
rights!'' but police did not disperse the crowd as they had for the
past three days.
   The demonstrators chanted the names of dissident playwright
Vaclav Havel and others jailed for taking part in demonstrations
that began Sunday in memory of Jan Palach.
   The 20-year-old student burned himself alive Jan. 16, 1969, to
protest the Soviet-led invasion of the previous August that ended
the the liberal ``Prague Spring'' reforms of Alexander Dubcek, then
Communist Party leader.
   Police used water cannons, tear gas, dogs and truncheons on
crowds in the historic central square Sunday, Monday and Tuesday,
drawing severe criticism from Secretary of State George P. Shultz
and other Western leaders.
   On Wednesday, riot police kept watch on the demonstrators but did
not try to disperse them.
   Demonstrators began assembling in the square about 5 p.m.,
attracting thousands of onlookers homeward bound from work.
   Chants of ``Gorbachev!'' ``Dubcek!'' ``Don't lie!'' and ``Free
Havel!'' rose from the crowd.
   Havel was one of 14 activists detained Monday when they appeared
at the square for the second day in a row to honor Palach by laying
flowers at the statue of King Wenceslas, where Palach set himself
afire.
   Many in the crowd shouted ``There's a handful of us here!'' to
mock official claims that the demonstrations involved only a few
anti-communist provocateurs.
   Some urged bystanders to join the demonstration and called out:
``Come back tomorrow!''
   About 2,000 people remained after an hour, clustered around the
statue of the king. They left after singing the national anthem, and
by 7 p.m. police had cordoned off the statue to discourage further
demonstrations.
   Earlier Wednesday, the official news agency CTK said the defense
and security committees of Parliament heard a report from Interior
Minister Frantisek Kincl ``on measures aimed at preserving order in
the last days, especially in the capital.''
   ``As elected representatives of the people, the (deputies)
expressed full support and appreciation to the police and People's
Militia for their resolute action and effort to maintain order and
prevent unrest,'' the agency said.
   ``Resolute legal action'' should be taken against organizers of
unrest, the parliamentary committees said, according to the CTK
dispatch.
   The news agency and the evening TV news said the education and
culture committees asked the public ``to isolate these hooligans.''

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday again
changed its position on when it knew about a suspected chemical
weapons plant in Libya, and opposition lawmakers shouted their
disapproval in Parliament.
   The latest switch came amid accusations by the opposition that
the government tried to cover up alleged involvement by West German
companies in the Libyan project.
   Wolfgang Schaeuble, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff,
delivered a long address in Parliament defending the government's
actions.
   Schaeuble said the U.S. Embassy in Bonn informed West German
officials May 18 about possible German involvement in the Libyan
plant.
   The United States alleges the plant was intended to produce
chemical weapons. Libya says it will produce pharmaceuticals.
   The May 15 date is five months earlier than what the government
acknowledged Monday and six months earlier than the Nov. 15 date
West German leaders mentioned three weeks ago.
   Opposition lawmakers shouted and hooted during the speech.
   When the scandal first broke three weeks ago, West German leaders
angrily denied U.S. allegations German firms were involved in the
plant. They also denied having any knowledge the complex may be
intended for production of chemical weapons.
   Norbert Gansel, a lawmaker with the opposition Social Democrats,
spoke after Schaeuble and criticized the government's handling of
the growing scandal, which has led to criminal investigations into
two West German companies.
   ``The question is, what you knew and what you did about it,''
Gansel said.
   He added, ``You, Herr Chancellor, are politically and personally
responsible that the German and international public were deceived
for a long time.''
   Officials have said the government did not immediately say what
it knew because that would have jeopardized West German
investigations.
   Schaeuble told lawmakers that in August 1987, the West German
Federal Intelligence Service received information the plant ``in all
probability'' was intended for producing chemical weapons.
   He said at the time there was no evidence of West German
involvement in the plant.
   Schaeuble also said that ``on the basis of intelligence reports,
we must assume that this plant in Rabta is intended to produce
chemical weapons.''
   On Tuesday, chief government spokesman Friedhelm Ost refused to
say whether Bonn had evidence backing the U.S. charges about the
plant.
   According to Schaeuble, ``new reports'' by the West German
Intelligence Service ``gave clear indications of involvement by
German companies'' in the Libyan factory.
   Kohl received his first ``comprehensive'' report on the
suspicions Oct. 20, Schaeuble said.
   Schaeuble also provided new information about West German
investigations into the affair.
   He said that on Dec. 14, West German investigators met with an
``informant'' who gave them documents indicating involvement by the
German firm Imhausen-Chemie in the Libyan plant.
   According to Schaeuble, the informant said other documents could
be obtained from I.B.I. Engineering, a now-defunct company that was
based in Frankfurt.
   Criminal investigations have been launched against Imhausen and
I.B.I., which allegedly organized participation by German firms in
the Libyan plant.
   The criminal investigations began as a result of a Jan. 4 seizure
of I.B.I. documents, Schaeuble said.
   He rejected any suggestion West German authorities had tried to
cover up the affair.
   Kohl was present during the debate but did not speak. According
to a government spokesman, Schaeuble delivered the speech because it
was a matter of protocol.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Schools and businesses reopened
Wednesday after a strike paralyzed the country, and organizers said
the work stoppage showed that Haitians ``want to turn a new page in
history.''
   Tuesday's strike was called by the Autonomous Union of Haitian
Workers, Haiti's largest and most radical union. It halted public
transport and closed businesses and schools in main provincial towns
and downtown Port-au-Prince.
   The union wants Haitian leader Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril to purge
his government of supporters of former dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier, who fled the country in 1986.
   They also want the daily minimum wage of $3 raised to $7 and a
decrease in food and fuel prices.
   ``The strike revealed the profound frustrations of the people,''
said human rights activist Jean-Claude Bajeux.
   ``The Haitian people have not only shown the military government
that they want change but that they want to prove it, to prove to
the whole world that they want to turn a new page in history,''
Jean-Auguste Mesyeux, co-leader of the union, said on Radio Haiti
Inter, an independent station.
   State-run Television Nationale reported it ``was not a general
strike'' but that activity had merely slowed in the capital. The
network did not cover the strike in provincial towns.
   The strike had been declared illegal by Avril, who came to power
Sept. 17 in a coup led by rank-and-file soldiers who said they were
fed up with state-sponsored violence. They overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy, the military leader who came to power after Duvalier fled.
   Friends continued searching Wednesday for two leftist activists
reported missing Monday night in a slum neighborhood. The two had
set out to distribute leaflets against inflation when they
disappeared, Radio Haiti Inter reported.
   They were identified as Vesner Jean-Francois and Roland Pierre,
members of a leftist umbrella group known as the National
Association of Popular Organizations.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo called Wednesday
for an early settlement of negotiations on U.S. military bases in
Seoul, and he urged people not to criticize the United States.
   Government officials said the president called for his
administration to seek a ``quiet and quick settlement'' over the
relocation of the facilities from central Seoul to rural areas.
   In Kwangju, 180 miles south of Seoul, radical students yelling
anti-American slogans and wielding sledgehammers and steel pipes
attacked a U.S. government cultural center and tried to burn down
the building, police said.
   About 50 attackers hurled firebombs and rocks at the building
after rushing through the gates, and some protesters climbed onto
the roof and tried to start the fire, according to authorities there.
   ``Drive out Yankee imperialists!'' the attackers chanted. There
were no reports of injuries.
   Roh's directive came at a meeting called to review South Korea's
foreign policy for the coming year.
   The Seoul bases occupy valuable land that South Korean officials
and developers want to use to meet growing demands for new offices
and homes.
   Roh cautioned against any ``emotional criticism'' of the United
States, referring to an expansion of anti-U.S. sentiment among the
Korean people, Foreign Ministry officials said.
   ``We must work to establish a mature and solid partnership with
the United States,'' Roh was quoted as saying.
   Dissidents and radicals have been demanding the withdrawal of the
42,000 U.S. troops based here. They contend the American forces
prevent unification with North Korea.
   The Seoul government strongly supports the presence of U.S.
forces. U.S. officials say American forces will remain in South
Korea as long as most South Koreans want them.
   Roh said Tuesday that U.S. forces will remain until real peace
has been established on the divided Korean peninsula.
   Talks are under way between U.S. and South Korean officials to
consider the relocation of U.S. barracks and the transfer of U.S.
operational control over South Korean troops.
   U.S. officials have indicated they are ready to remove military
bases from Seoul if South Korea provides comparable facilities
elsewhere.
   South Korea also wants the Status of Forces Agreement revised to
give South Korea more jurisdiction over U.S. soldiers. The 1966
pact, which defines the legal status of U.S. troops, has been
criticized for favoring Americans in criminal and other matters.
   U.S. troops have been based in South Korea since 1950 to help
defend the nation against communist North Korea, which invaded the
South in 1950.
   U.S. and South Korean officials agree political and economic
changes have caused South Korea to reassess its relationship with
the United States, a close ally since the division of the Korean
peninsula.
   Korea was split into the communist North and the capitalist South
in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet troops ended Japan's colonial rule at
the end of World War II.

<HEAD>The Speculation Mounts: Might Bush Walk in His Own Parade?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's penchant for spontanaiety is
raising speculation about whether he might just decide to hop out of
his armored limousine Friday for a bit of inaugural parade
handshaking.
   While there is no word from the Bush camp on whether he might
decide to work the sidewalk crowds, the Secret Service is fully
prepared with protection for whatever fancy might strike him, said
spokesman Special Agent Rich Adams.
   ``We would be derelict in our duty if we weren't prepared for
that,'' he said. ``The possibility always exists ... He's the
president and we're there to provide security.''
   However, Adams said he has no information on whether Bush will
decide to get out of the brand new 1989 Ford Lincoln town car.
   Bush wouldn't be the first president to walk in his own parade.
   Jimmy Carter got out of his limousine in 1977 and walked hand in
hand with his wife Rosalynn for much of the distance down
Pennsylvania Avenue.
   President Reagan did not follow suit in 1981, remaining inside
his car.
   Bush's black limousine, which is being used for the first time,
has a bit less window area than Reagan's did, so that people will
have less chance of glimpsing him inside.
   Both before and since his Nov. 8 election, Bush has set a style
that is much more spontaneous than Reagan's. He likes to dine
spur-of-the-moment at local restaurants and has turned up a local
clothing or specialty shops.
   During the campaign Bush would occasionally stop his motorcade to
chat with farmers in their fields or schoolchildren by the road.
   On one occasion a rural restaurant got word that he might stop
for a meal and the proprietors became irate when he instead walked
into a mom-and-pop store next door and bought a couple slices of
pizza to go.

<TEXT>
   A trail-blazing Soviet magazine and its
editor-in-chief came under fire from the two most prominent
newspapers Wednesday, with one printing a letter that denounced the
weekly as ``scum'' bent on defaming Soviet history.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the magazine Ogonyok and
its chief, Vitaly Korotich, have become widely known and
increasingly controversial. Many of the sensational revelations made
by Soviet media under Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or greater
openness, have appeared in Ogonyok.
   In this week's issue, the slick magazine with more 3 million
subscribers nationwide revealed Soviet suicide statistics for recent
years, denounced pollution and ran the latest episode of an expose
on corruption and cronyism under the late leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   Seven prominent cultural figures, in a letter to the Communist
Party daily newspaper Pravda, bitterly attacked Ogonyok, saying it
had gone ``far outside the bounds of literary arguments.''
   ``The magazine has taken upon itself the role of a kind of judge
on all questions of social life, politics, the economy, culture and
morals,'' they wrote.
   The seven grouped Ogonyok along with Soviet publications they
said are engaged in an ``unprecedented distortion of history, and
that revise the social achievements of the people.''
   They accused it of printing unverified hearsay and of deprecating
Soviet cultural icons such as poet Vladimir Mayakovsky and Nobel
literature laureate Mikhail Sholokhov, author of ``And Quiet Flows
the Don.''
   Those signing the letter, including conservative writers Valentin
Rasputin and Vasily Belov, said they supported ``with all their
souls'' the reform program undertaken by Gorbachev, but had become
alarmed by ``scum bubbling up on the crest of the mighty stream of
renovation.''
   Ogonyok has drawn tough and insulting criticism from other Soviet
media before, but Pravda gave great prominence to the letter,
printing it above the fold on its back page. That placement in the
party's top daily could indicate high-level irritation at Ogonyok
and its view of the Soviet past and present.
   Since the magazine has been one of the leaders in the drive for
franker discussion of social problems and a more honest
coming-to-grips with the country's past, any official attack on it
would be perceived by many Soviets as a signal of glasnost's limits.
   Izvestia, the government's afternoon newspaper, ran its own
correspondent's article that cast doubt on Ogonyok's credibility and
wondered aloud why Korotich was trying to run in a Moscow
neighborhood for a seat in a new national assembly, the Council of
People's Deputies, to be elected in March.
   The Ogonyok editor was seen by millions of U.S. television
viewers when CBS News anchorman Dan Rather visited with him in a
segment of the network's 1987 documentary on Soviet life, ``Seven
Days in May.'' Under glasnost, the magazine has been transformed
from a staid journal to a lively and popular magazine.
   Izvestia correspondent A. Stepovoi said he attended a Jan. 9
meeting of voters from Moscow's 21st electoral district called to
nominate Korotich to the new council. Ogonyok this week ran a story
on the same meeting, and said it was broken up by vocal right-wing
Russian nationalists extremists before the necessary quorum of 500
voters could assemble.
   Stepovoi, however, said not only members of the group known as
``Pamyat,'' or ``Memory,'' had caused the disorders, implying
Korotich supporters also were involved. He said the shouting march
began after organizers of the meeting announced they had failed to
assemble a quorum and that Korotich would hold a ``creative
meeting'' instead.
   Stepovoi also questioned why Korotich would want to run for the
new assembly from a Moscow district, since some Soviet social
organizations that are entitled to direct representation in the
assembly have already named Korotich as a candidate.
   ``What's the point?'' Stepovoi asked. ``As Ogonyok has reported,
Korotich was nominated as a candidate for people's deputy of the
U.S.S.R.'' He added: ``I can personally note that he's been chosen
by the magazine's collective.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears Case that Could Affect Racial Bias Claims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case that could affect
on-the-job racial bias lawsuits nationwide, was urged Wednesday to
throw out discrimination charges against Alaska salmon canneries.
   Both sides in the case acknowledged that the industry _ a
seasonal business that relies on migrant workers drawn from remote
areas _ is hardly typical of U.S. commerce.
   But the case could provide standards for handling job
discrimination claims throughout the nation.
   Douglas M. Fryer, a lawyer for two companies based in Washington
state and Oregon, said employers in the case have done more than
their fair share of hiring minorities at canneries they operate in
Alaska.
   The companies ``should not be penalized'' under misplaced legal
theories adopted by a lower court, Fryer said.
   But Abraham A. Arditi, representing Filipinos, Alaska natives and
Asians, said the companies relegated the minority workers to the
lowest-paying jobs in a ``pervasive'' discriminatory system.
   He said the minority workers were capable of doing the
better-paying jobs. ``There's no question about the availability of
skilled personnel'' among the minority groups, Arditi said.
   The court's ruling, expected by July, could clear up questions
left unanswered by a ruling last June that said employees can use
statistical evidence to prove that some subjective decisions made by
their employers violate federal law. The court reinstated a suit by
a black woman who charged a Texas bank with discrimination.
   But that ruling failed to produce a majority of five votes for
any particular legal theory, and some observers believe it could
prove at best a mixed blessing for minority groups.
   In the Alaska case, non-whites charged discrimination by Wards
Cove Packing Co. Inc. of Seattle and Castle &amp; Cooke Inc. of Astoria,
Ore.
   The companies operate salmon canneries in remote areas of Alaska
during the summer salmon run.
   Non-whites say that while they hold nearly half the jobs at the
canneries, the jobs are racially stratified with whites dominating
in the higher-paying positions such as machinists, carpenters and
administrators.
   The companies said any racial divisions are for legitimate
business-related reasons. For example, they said most higher-paying
jobs require skill and prior experience that non-whites have
difficulty acquiring because they are seasonal workers from remote
regions of Alaska.
   Arditi, challenging that claim Wednesday, said nepotism is
pervasive in the canneries with whites hiring inexperienced youthful
relatives for higher-paying jobs.
   ``You have 14-year-olds, 15-year-olds, 16-year-olds who are hired
for upper-level jobs,'' Arditi said.
   Justice Antonin Scalia questioned whether that is proof of racial
bias. He offered the example of a family-owned business that hires
family members.
   One of the key issues in the case is the use of statistics to
demonstrate bias _ or the lack of it.
   Fryer argued that statistics showing non-whites holding most of
the lower-paying seasonal cannery worker jobs and fewer better
positions do not prove discrimination.
   The relevant figures are those showing that the companies hire
for the higher-ranking positions from a Pacific Northwest labor
market that is only 10 percent non-white, he said. The companies say
they filled those more desirable jobs with more than 20 percent
non-whites.
   A federal judge ruled in favor of the companies in 1983, throwing
out the suit. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated
the suit in 1987 and ordered a full trial.
   The companies appealed to the Supreme Court to overrule the
appeals court.
   The Reagan administration is siding with the cannery owners. The
Justice Department said the 9th Circuit court placed too heavy a
burden on the companies to disprove the bias claims.
   The case is Wards Cove vs. Atonio, 87-1387.

<HEAD>One Expectant Mother In Five Uses Cocaine, BCH Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A continuing Boston City Hospital study has found
that 18 percent of expectant mothers, most from the inner city, use
cocaine at least once during pregnancy.
   ``It's very alarming,'' said Dr. Barry Zuckerman of the
hospital's Division of Development Behavioral Pediatrics. ``Cocaine
is not only bad during pregnancy, but being a cocaine abuser is not
a great way for a child to be reared.''
   The study is expected to be completed in six months and Zuckerman
said Wednesday that researchers are still investigating the health
consequences of the drug abuse.
   Dr. Elizabeth Brown, director of neo-natalogy at BCH, said
cocaine abuse is a common problem.
   ``This isn't just something pregnant women do. It's something
people do. We're seeing an epidemic number of people using cocaine.
A lot of what we're seeing in babies is related to the amount of
drugs on the street,'' she said.
   Some babies born to cocaine abusers have small heads, indicating
their brains haven't grown adequately, Brown said. Other potential
side effects in infants are irritability, quivering, behavioral
abnormalities and poor feeding ability.
   The study of 1,226 pregnant women was based on urine tests and
interviews conducted between July 1984 and December 1987 at BCH,
which serves a large portion of Boston's inner-city population. The
study was funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
   Other results of the BCH study included:
   _36 percent of the admitted drug users said they used cocaine
less than once a month.
   _16 percent used it up to three times monthly.
   _25 percent said they used it once or twice a week.
   _23 percent said they used it three or more times a week.
   Last summer, a study by the National Association for Perinatal
Addiction Research and Education found that at least 11 percent in
36 participating hospitals had used illegal drugs during pregnancy.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Soviet Forces in European Theater to Be Cut by 240,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday his
program to cut the armed forces by 500,000 men will bring a
reduction of 240,000 Soviet soldiers in the European theater and
200,000 in Asia in the next two years.
   Gorbachev said the number of Soviet soldiers, sailors and airmen
will be cut by 12 percent, the military budget trimmed by 14.2
percent and the production of arms and military supplies slashed by
19.5 percent.
   He said 10,000 tanks will be eliminated in Europe, of which
``5,000 will be physically liquidated, and the others transformed
into towing vehicles for civilian needs or into training
simulators.''
   Gorbachev accused some people in the West of disparaging the
unilateral Soviet move by claiming that only obsolete armored
vehicles would be destroyed.
   ``Here's the way it is: We will withdraw 5,000 of the most modern
tanks from our military groups,'' the Soviet leader said.
   It was his most detailed explanation yet of the implications of
his Dec. 7 announcement in a United Nations speech that the Soviet
Union will cut its armed forces by 500,000 men over the next two
years.
   Gorbachev gave the details in a meeting with former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing of France, former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone and other visiting dignitaries. His remarks were
distributed by the official Tass news agency.
   ``Of the 500,000 men, by which the army and fleet will be reduced
in two years, 240,000 will come from the European part of the
country, 200,000 in the east, and 60,000 in the south,'' Gorbachev
said.
   Gorbachev also said the second phase of the withdrawal of Soviet
military units from Mongolia, a Moscow ally, will begin soon, and
that they will be cut by 75 percent. A Soviet air force group
stationed in Mongolia will be liquidated, he said.
   He also said many Red Army units of an ``offensive character''
will be withdrawn from Eastern Europe.
   By Jan. 1, 1991, all remaining Soviet units stationed on the
territory of Moscow allies in that region will have taken on ``an
exclusively defensive character,'' he said.
   On Monday, a Soviet general was quoted as telling Austrian
television that his country's unilateral withdrawal from Eastern
Europe will begin in April.
   Deputy Defense Minister Vitaly Shabanov was quoted as saying the
partial withdrawal of 50,000 troops from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany, announced by Gorbachev in his U.N. speech, will take
place in two phases.
   The first phase will be complete this year, and the second in
1990, Austrian television reported Shabonov as saying in an
interview with its Moscow correspondent.

<HEAD>Report: Saudi Arabia Allows Amin To Return</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zaire on Wednesday expelled exiled Ugandan
dictator Idi Amin to Saudi Arabia, a French news agency reported.
   Zaire first expelled Amin last week, but he ended up back in
Kinshasa after Saudi officials reportedly refused to let him board a
plane to the kingdom.
   Agence France-Presse quoted unidentified sources Wednesday as
saying that this time a ``great friend'' of Zaire President Mobutu
Sese Seko persuaded Saudi officials to let Amin return. The report
could not immediately be confirmed.
   The former Ugandan leader has lived in Saudi Arabia since his
overthrow in 1979.
   Amin, 61, first arrived in Zaire Jan. 3 on a false passport. He
was expelled on Thursday to Dakar, Senegal. From there, he was
expected to be returned to Saudi Arabia, but ended up on a flight
back to Zaire.
   Arab diplomats in Saudi Arabia have told The Associated Press
that Amin had abused his hospitality in the kingdom and would not be
allowed to return. Saudi Arabia granted him political asylum in 1980.
   Saudi officials have not commented on Amin's travels or whether
they planned to bar him from the nation.
   Last week, Uganda asked for Amin's extradition from Zaire, but
the nations do not have an extradition treaty. Uganda's state-owned
newspaper, New Vision, said on Tuesday that Amin should face trial
in his homeland.
   Amnesty International, a London-based human rights organization,
estimates that between 50,000 and 300,000 Ugandans disappeared
during Amin's rule.
   Since his overthrow, Amin has sought support for a return to rule
in Uganda.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission has filed consumer
fraud charges against a Virginia physician who told patients his
treatments would increase their chances of becoming pregnant, the
FTC said Wednesday.
   The complaint alleges that Dr. Cecil Jacobson, director of the
Reproductive Genetic Center of Vienna, Va., told his patients his
hormone-injection treatments had resulted in full-term, successful
pregnancies for more than 80 percent of his patients.
   In fact, no more than 40 percent of those who received repeated
injections of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, or HCG, became pregnant,
according to FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver.
   While HCG slightly enhances the odds of a woman becoming
pregnant, the hormone is more commonly found simply as a chemical
biproduct of pregnancy, usually showing up in urine tests, according
to the FTC.
   In all, Jacobson treated ``several hundred women'' who lost from
$400,000 to more than $2 million, Oliver said.
   The FTC will be seeking a return of some or all fees collected
from each patient Jacobson treated, Oliver said.
   In addition, the FTC has also asked the U.S. District Court for
Eastern Virginia to issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting
Jacobson from making further such claims.
   Several of Jacobson's patients have also filed civil suits
against him. They are seeking recovery of fees; some also want
unspecified damages.
   While the treatments caused no physical harm, a 38-year-old
patient of Jacobson's was told by another physician that she had
greatly diminished her chances of becoming pregnant because the
several years she spent using Jacobson's program had taken her
closer to the end of her fertility cycle, an FTC official said.
   Jacobson was not immediately available to comment. His license to
practice medicine has not been suspended, Oliver said.

   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin walked out of a
stormy parliament debate Wednesday after opposition members heckled
him about increased bloodshed in the occupied territories and
demanded he resign.
   Eight small parties tried to bring down the government with a
series of no-confidence motions, but legislators of the broad
national unity government voted them down.
   The opposition reflected growing unease many Israelis feel about
the army's handling of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip. There also is frustration because the army has
not been able to squelch the 13-month revolt, which does not appear
to be flagging.
   The Cabinet met privately for a briefing on tougher army policies
that include destroying the houses of suspected stone-throwers and
liberalizing shooting regulations.
   At the United Nations in New York, deputy PLO observer Riyad H.
Mansour said the Israelis were committing ``a small massacre'' in an
attempt to crush the uprising during the transition between U.S.
administrations.
   Rabin, who stopped his speech at least a dozen times because of
raucous shouting, left the podium after about half an hour and
refused to complete his statement.
   ``I propose the government reject these no-confidence motions,''
he said quietly before leaving the hall.
   The debate was over the high number of Palestinian deaths in
recent weeks.
   Thirteen Palestinians have been killed in the past week, and
critics have blamed many of the casualties on the army's increasing
use of plastic bullets and newly introduced rubber-coated metal
pellets.
   Four Palestinians were reported wounded in stone-throwing clashes
with Israeli troops in the West Bank on Wednesday. The army
confirmed the injures, two in Hebron and two near Nablus.
   The army spokesman's office said it was checking reports that on
Tuesday and Wednesday an army lieutenant fired at rooftop water
tanks in the West Bank town of Tulkarem. Arab reporters said five
tanks were punctured.
   Rabin said that as long as Palestinians stage violent protests,
the tougher army policies will stand.
   ``As long as they say, `We will continue with violence,' their
violence will be met with force,'' he said. ``What is Israel to do?''
   ``Talk peace!'' shouted one Arab member of parliament.
   ``Get out of the territories!'' shouted another.
   ``This is a government with a plastic heart, a brain of lead and
a conscience of rubber,'' said Mohammad Miari of the Progressive
List for Peace.
   Rabin said residents of the occupied territories refused to
abandon support for the Palestine Liberation Organization and
instead talk peace directly with Israel.
   Israel refuses to talk with the PLO, which it considers a
terrorist organization.
   ``What does all that have to do with killing children, with the
daily slaughter in the territories?'' shouted Tewfik Toubi, an Arab
member of the Israel Communist Party.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, 362 Palestinians have
been killed and 15 Jews have died.
   Two right-wing parties filed no-confidence motions, but they
charged that Rabin was too soft on Palestinians during the
intefadeh, which is Arabic for uprising.
   ``We have failed to deal with the intefadeh,'' said Rehavam
Zee'vi of the right-wing Homeland Party. ``Youths and children are
going wild in the streets and villages while we sit embarrassed and
confused.''
   His party advocates mass deportations of Arabs.
   Yossi Sarid of the liberal Citizens Rights Movement charged that
the government's policy ``is not just killing Palestinians, it is
killing the souls of Israeli soldiers.''
   He was referring to complaints that angry soldiers lodged Tuesday
with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir when he visited a tent camp in
Nablus. They said they were foced to beat innocent people and felt
they were betraying their values.

   Two people injured in a weekend train
collision died in a hospital Wednesday, bringing the death toll in
Bangladesh's worst railway accident to 119, hospital officials said.
   Doctors said 116 people were still hospitalized for treatment of
injuries suffered in the accident in central Bangladesh on Sunday.
Forty-seven of them suffered arm and leg fractures and may be
crippled, doctors said.
   The doctors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said several
will require limb amputations.
   The crash occurred when a passenger train traveling about 50 mph
rammed head-on into a mail train outside the village of Maizdi Khan,
16 miles north of Dhaka.
   At least 100 people died at the scene and 19 others have died in
hospitals. Officials said at least 1,000 people were injured in the
collision.
   The government has put the death toll at 82, but its count is
generally considered too low due to bureacratic delays in counting
the dead. Dhaka newspapers placed the toll at more than 200.

   The State Department said Wednesday it has
obtained a tape recording of Yasser Arafat, the Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman, threatening to pump ``10 bullets in the
chest'' of anyone trying to stifle the Palestinian uprising on the
Israeli-held West Bank and in Gaza.
   The department noted that Arafat has since denied the threat, and
there was no indication the United States was reconsidering its
decision to talk with the PLO.
   But officials said the United States has made clear to Arafat
that it considers the comment inconsistent with his commitment to
renounce terrorism.
   And U.S. sources speaking on condition of anonymity said that
President Reagan told Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in a letter
of his concern over the remarks. Reagan said Egypt and the United
States must make sure Arafat does not deviate from his pledge to
refrain from terrorism and to recognize Israel's right to exist,
said the sources.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the department had
received a tape recording of comments Arafat made last week in which
he said, ``Whoever thinks of stopping the Intifada before it
achieves its goals, I will give him 10 bullets in the chest.''
Intifada is the Arabic word for the 13-month uprising by
Palestinians against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   The reported threat was believed to be directed at Elias Freij,
the mayor of the West Bank town of Bethlehem who is considered a
moderate Palestinian and who called for a truce in the uprising.
   Arafat has denied threatening him, but Redman said, ``That is
clearly a threat. We've made it clear that this threat is
inconsistent with Arafat's December 14 renunciation of terrorism and
with the U.S.-PLO dialogue.''
   That dialogue began last December, after the organization
accepted American conditions that it recognization of Israel's right
to exist and renounce use of terrorism. Since then, U.S. Ambassador
Robert Pelletreau has met in Tunis with several PLO officials.
   Last year, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, accusing the PLO
of terrorism and Arafat of being an accessory, barred the issuance
of a visa to the PLO chief to address the United Nations General
Assembly in New York. Shultz subsequently recommended the U.S.
dialogue with the PLO, while maintaining a public campaign against
terrorism.
   The renewed possibility of an Arafat visit to the United States
arose after the PLO chief said he would be willing to address the
annual convention of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee
in Washington in April.
   But Arafat told a group of Arab Americans who met with him in
Tunis last week that he could only come to Washington if they could
arrange a visa for him, said one participant, Khalil Jahshan.
   Redman said if Arafat applied for a visa to address a group in
the United States ``we would look at it very carefully.'' He said
such an application at the moment was ``hypothetical.''
   Secretary of State-designate James Baker was noncommittal on the
visa question Wednesday at his Senate confirmation hearing. He said
he was ``not in a position to prejudge what we would do'' if Arafat
applies for a visa.
   Baker also said there is a difference between asking for a visa
to address the U.N. and asking for a visa ``in conjunction'' with a
speaking engagement in Washington. He did not elaborate, saying he
did not want to be seen as ``tilting'' the issue one way or another.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one of the last public events of his eight
years in the White House, President Reagan on Wednesday paid a
sentimental tribute to the championship Notre Dame football team and
received in return a sweater once presented to _ who else? _ George
Gipp.
   Reagan, whose role as Gipp, the Notre Dame star, in ``Knute
Rockne, All-American'' gave him his first big break in the movie
career that helped propel him to the presidency, told the players:
   ``I can't help thinking that somewhere a long way off there's a
fellow with a big grin and a lot of pride in his school and he might
be thinking to himself that maybe you won another one for the
Gipper.''
   The line was a paraphrase of one spoken by Pat O`Brien as Rockne
in the movie, invoking the memory of Gipp after his death to inspire
the team to victory. It has become a political slogan Reagan has
repeated many times.
   Reagan told the players how much he values his association with
Notre Dame, which he has twice visited during his presidency.
   ``The INF Treaty and George Bush's election were important, but
having the Fighting Irish win the national championship is in a
class by itself,'' he said.
   The president of Notre Dame, the Rev. Edward Malloy, presented
Reagan with the sweater, in a glass-lidded presentation box. The
sweater had been awarded to Gipp for his performance as a halfback
on the Notre Dame team in 1917 and 1918.
   ``I think that's a great sacrifice by the university, but,
believe me, no one could treasure it more than I will,'' the
president said.
   Lou Holtz, the coach of the Fighting Irish, gave Reagan a
football from the team's 34-21 Fiesta Bowl victory over the
University of West Virginia. Reagan tossed the ball to a member of
the Notre Dame team.
   The Fiesta Bowl victory Jan. 2 gave the university its eighth
national championship _ the most in the 53-year history of the
Associated Press poll.

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater,
indicating at least one way that George Bush will differ from Ronald
Reagan, advised reporters Wednesday that ``we will start earlier in
the day.''
   Fitzwater, who has been President Reagan's chief spokesman since
early 1987 and will continue in that capacity when Bush becomes
president, said ``we will have a lot of earlier coverage events.''
   Bush, he added, ``is going to start his work schedule at 8 a.m.
and he also has breakfast at 7:15 a.m. _ and things like that.''
   Reagan has been a habitual 9-to-5 man, throughout his public and
private career, and the early word on the Bush schedule indicates
longer hours.

<HEAD>West German Prosecutors Open New Probes in Libyan Scandal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Germany-Libya</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors on Wednesday announced
criminal probes of a key company in the Libyan chemical weapons
plant dispute and a Bavarian company that reportedly delivered
sophisticated equipment to Libya's air force.
   The new probes bring to three the number of criminal
investigations in the widening scandal, and in each case authorities
acknowledged they were checking allegations made by West German news
reports.
   Since the first allegations of West German involvement were
published early this month, the nation's news media have been
particularly aggressive about pursuing the story.
   Politicians, meanwhile, have had to retract their earlier denials
of West German involvement with the plant in Rabta, 60 miles south
of the Libyan capital of Tripoli. Washington says it was built to
make chemical arms, while the Libyan government of Col. Moammar
Gadhafi says it will make pharmaceuticals.
   In Bonn on Wednesday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl sat with other
lawmakers as his chief aide, Wolfgang Schaeuble, addressed an
acrimonious session of Parliament about when the government in Bonn
first learned of the charges.
   Schaeuble said the U.S. government in May passed on tips about
West German involvement in the suspected Libyan chemical weapons
plant. He said the tips also involved the alleged German help in
providing Gadhafi's air force with midair refueling capability.
   The Frankfurt prosecutor's office said Wednesday it has opened a
criminal investigation of the now-defunct I.B.I. Engineering
company, which U.S. officials have accused of providing equipment
for the plant.
   ``Our authorities opened the probe against I.B.I. on Friday
because of suspicion of reported violations of export laws,''
Frankfurt prosecutor Jochen Schroers told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview.
   He declined to provide further information about I.B.I., which
allegedly provided the contracts to the West German companies to
build the plant.
   West Germany's ARD television network reported that about 50
companies just in the greater Frankfurt area are suspected of having
taken part. Federal customs officials are also investigating.
   In Munich, chief prosecutor Heinz Stocker said he was looking
into a report in this week's Der Spiegel magazine that says the
Intec Technical Trade and Logistik company has been helping Libya
develop the ability to refuel its warplanes while in flight.
   The prosecutor said he had already planned to investigate Intec,
but added authorities want to know whether the report in Spiegel is
correct.
   ``That is a point of the investigation,'' Stocker told the AP in
a telephone interview late Wednesday afternoon. ``We will have to
see what comes out.''
   The probe against Intec ``concerns fuel tank equipment sent to
Libya'' and may also involve violations of West Germany's export
laws, he said. ``We don't know what was done with this equipment in
Libya.''
   Der Spiegel reported 10 Intec-hired engineers are playing a key
role in helping Libya fit warplanes and transport planes with
equipment necessary for mid-air refueling to extend the warplanes'
range.
   Intec is in the town of Vaterstetten near Munich.
   Last week, Offenburg prosecutor Werner Botz announced he was
investigating the Imhausen-Chemie company, which reportedly also had
a major role in the construction of the suspected chemical weapons
plant.
   Offenburg is near the Black Forest town of Lahr, where Imhausen
has its headquarters.

<HEAD>19th-Century Woman's Story Is Talk of Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY HARKAVY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FAYETTE, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The long-whispered dark secret of a
19th-century woman who was ostracized by this small town after she
reputedly violated one of society's strictest sexual taboos was
openly the talk of the town Wednesday.
   ``Everybody's been buzzing about this,'' librarian Suzanne Rich
said the day after an documentary about the woman who unknowingly
married her own son was broadcast nationally on public television.
   At the town office, deputy clerk Audrey Bamford said most
everyone she spoke to had taped the show on their videocassette
recorder. ``I guess it's the most taped show in the town of
Fayette,'' she said.
   The story of Emeline Bacheldor, born in 1816, has surfaced twice
in the past decade. The first was ``Emmeline,'' a fictionalized
account with an altered spelling by best-selling author Judith
Rossner.
   Then on Tuesday, the facts came fully out in the open when a
nonfiction account, ``Sins of Our Mothers,'' was shown as the final
installment of Public Broadcasting Service's ``The American
Experience'' series.
   Most residents of t6his western Maine town reacted favorably to
the documentary, expressing shock and sadness at the way Emeline was
shunned by the town and forced to live out her final years in
isolation and poverty in a tiny shack.
   They also noted how dramatically society's attitudes have changed.
   ``Back then everybody was very puritanical, and if anyone did
anything that was against the rules of the church, they avoided them
like the plague. But people today are a lot more forgiving,'' said
Mrs. Bamford, who helped research the program.
   The program, based on interviews and town records, told how
Emeline was sent to work in a Massachusetts cotton mill and became
pregnant at the age of 14.
   The baby was given up for adoption, and Emeline returned to
Fayette where she married. Her husband later ran away, and she fell
in love with a much younger man, Leonard Gurney, whom she married
when she was 62.
   But when Gurney's relatives came to meet his bride, they realized
he was the son she had given up. The marriage was annulled, Gurney
left town and Emeline was treated as an outcast.
   Criticism of the film focused on its accuracy and the motivation
of those behind the project.
   Arnold Sturtevant, a banker and deacon of the Fayette Baptist
Church, called the documentary ``a valuable and sensitive portrayal
of the human condition, a true tragedy.''
   But he added: ``How much can be a true, loving concern for the
poverty-stricken and socially oppressed, such as Emeline, and how
much of it might be more properly characterized as selfish catering
to man's taste for prurient sensationalism?''
   Library volunteer Laura Merrill complained that the film
portrayed the town in a negative light.
   Producer David Hoffman first learned of Emeline while
interviewing Nettie Mitchell, an elderly woman known as a
storyteller, in 1974 for an unrelated Bicenntennial project.
   Mrs. Mitchell, who died in 1981 two days before her 95th
birthday, was believed to have been the last person to set eyes upon
Emeline, who died in 1898. She recalled being sent by her father to
take food to the outcast woman who otherwise would have starved to
death.
   ``I was absolutely flabbergasted,'' recalled Hoffman. He took the
story to Rossner, the novelist best-known for ``Looking for Mr.
Goodbar.'' Rossner's 1980 book, ``Emmeline,'' was based on what she
heard from Mrs. Mitchell, but made little claim to historic accuracy.
   Before Rossner's book, according to most accounts, Emeline's
story was a town secret, known by longtime residents.
   ``It was talked about, but always whispered _ dirty rumors and
that sort of thing,'' said Matthew Collins, director of the
documentary.
   Town Manager Mike DeArmott, a longtime resident, said Emeline's
story was ``one of those things that was kind of hidden away back in
the corner.''
   ``Everyone embellished it a little bit,'' he said, and they would
``luxuriate in our little secret.''

   A passenger train crashed into a bus Wednesday at
an unguarded rail crossing in northeast China, killing at least 32
people and injuring 41 aboard the bus, an official report said.
   The Xinhua News Agency said it had no word of any casualties
among people on the train.
   The train was traveling in Huinan County in Jilin province when
it collided with the bus, pushing it about 90 feet up the track,
Xinhua said. The front car of the train was derailed, it said.
   The accident was similar to two others in the past month in
northeast China.
   Thirty-one people were killed, including members of a bridal
party, when a freight train collided with a bus Jan. 1 in
Heilongjiang province, north of Jilin.
   Forty-six people died and 67 were injured when a train in
Liaoning province, south of Jilin, collided with a bus on Dec. 23.

   Newly arrived Nicaraguans expressed gratitude
Wednesday at the warm reception they've received and puzzlement at
black resentment that some say has fueled rioting.
   ``The support of our Cuban brothers has been very generous, the
solidarity with them has been great,'' said Carlos Quintero, 43, one
of about 2,000 Central Americans who have immigrated to the Miami
area the past two months.
   The influx swelled to about 100,000 people the Nicaraguan exile
community centered in a county that already was one-third Cuban.
   Some black community leaders have cited resentment over the
welcome given the Nicaraguans and fears the new immigrants will
crowd blacks out of jobs as fueling ethnic tensions in Miami. The
rioting that broke out this week began after the fatal shooting of a
young black man by a Hispanic police officer.
   ``The riots are terrible, a disaster,'' said Quintero, who with
his wife and three children have been taken in by Nicaraguan friends
in Sweetwater, the nearby city dubbed Little Managua. ``I don't
understand it. I heard it might have something to do with us. I
heard the blacks don't like us too much.''
   ``This doesn't have anything to do with us. We didn't come here
to cause problems. We came here to work and to live in freedom,''
said Julio Aquilar, a youth looking over a Spanish-language
newspaper report on the rioting.
   He was outside Bobby Maduro Stadium, a makeshift city shelter for
about 200 Nicaraguans and about 180 other Miami homeless people.
   The city is renovating a replacement shelter so the stadium can
be vacated by next week and readied for its spring tenants, the
Baltimore Orioles baseball team. Meanwhile, the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese put up 150 immigrants at its Family Activities Center on
Sunday.
   Gerard Jean-Juste, a Catholic priest, and other Haitian community
leaders and some American black leaders said Haitians, who are
black, don't receive such help. They said the United States has a
racist immigration policy of intercepting Haitians at sea and
sending them back home while allowing white Hispanics to enter from
Central America and apply for political asylum.
   Cuban-born Mayor Xavier Suarez has blamed the rioting on bad
police relations with the black community and other long-term
problems. But he also said Wednesday it was time for U.S.
immigration policy to remove distinctions that give the appearance
of discrimination.
   The Nicaraguan arrivals hit a peak of 200 a day after a federal
judge in Texas ruled two weeks ago that U.S. immigration authorities
couldn't force them to stay near the border while their political
asylum requests were being considered.
   Virginia Kice, Immigration and Naturalization Service spokeswoman
in Harlingen, Texas, said that since Jan. 9, authorities had
received 2,733 political asylum applications from Central Americans.
Of those, 44 percent were Nicaraguans, she said.
   ``Thirty-four percent (of the Central Americans) indicated they
were traveling on to Miami, which is fewer than we expected from our
previous experience,'' Ms. Kice said. She said it was too early to
speculate on why the numbers were lower than the 50 percent
predicted. New York and Los Angeles, at 13 percent each, were the
next-favorite destinations, she said.
   Many of the Nicaraguans are without work permits, which are
handed out slowly by INS after case-by-case review. But in addition
to city aid, Spanish-language radio and television drives have
raised about $70,000, and private donors have kept them supplied
with clothing and food.
   ``A lot of them have gained weight here. Some of them got sick
because they ate too much,'' said Pablo Canton, assistant city
director of community development.
   ``Most of the Cubans can identify with this group; that's why
they've been so generous,'' said Canton, who came with his family
from Cuba 27 years ago at age 16. ``They're going through the same
thing we went through, leaving their homeland because of
communists.''
   He rejected criticisms from some black leaders that the city has
gone out of its way to accommodate Nicaraguans while doing little
for its other poor and homeless.
   ``We have a big heart for everybody,'' Canton said. ``These
people need help, and the federal government isn't doing anything.
We're just trying to help them get started; to give them a positive
attitude that this is the land of dreams if you work for it.''

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department on Wednesday officially
crowned Texas the winner of a seven-state battle to host a proposed
$5.9 billion superconducting super collider.
   At a formal ceremony attended by Texas Gov. Bill Clements, John
Herrington, the energy secretary, signed an official ``record of
decision'' to build the massive physics installation around the city
of Waxahachie, about 25 miles south of Dallas.
   The collider is envisioned as a 53-mile underground ring that
would use 10,000 magnets to whirl beams of protons into each other
at energy levels 20 times what is possible in today's most powerful
machines.
   Scientists will use the facility to explore the nature of matter
and energy. It is to be called the Ronald Reagan Center for
High-Energy Physics, although it remains uncertain whether Congress
will give the go-ahead to begin construction.
   Last year, Congress agreed to spend $100 million on the collider,
but it decreed that none of the money be spent on construction. In
his budget proposal for the coming fiscal year, President Reagan
requested $250 million for the collider, including $90 million for
research and development and $160 million for construction.
   Herrington had declared last Nov. 10 that Texas was the
``preferred site'' for the project, but a waiting period was
required before the choice was made official.
   ``Texas has been chosen as the super collider site because it is
the superior site from an overall standpoint,'' Herrington said at
the signing ceremony.
   Some of the states that lost in the bidding have questioned the
Energy Department's selection process.
   Democratic Sens. Paul Simon of Illinois and Dennis DeConcini of
Arizona are among those who have asked Congress's investigative arm,
the General Accounting Office, to review the department's site
selection process and to determine whether the choice was influenced
more by politics than by merit.
   Victor F. Weisskopf, a physicist who attended the signing
ceremony as part of a separate award presentation, said the super
collider would allow scientists to explore ``how this great universe
was started and how it has developed.''
   ``We need the superconducting super collider ... to help all the
scientists of the planet to penetrate deeper into the mysteries of
matter,'' he said.
   Besides Arizona and Illinois, the states which lost the bidding
race were Colorado, Michigan, North Carolina and Tennessee.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Convictions Needed In '85 Soccer Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor on Wednesday urged a judge
to convict 15 Britons, two Belgian police officers and a former
soccer official on charges stemming from a 1985 stadium riot that
killed 39 soccer fans.
   ``The sentence should be an example,'' Prosecutor Pierre Erauw
said during the third and final day of his closing argument.
   On trial are 26 Britons, two Belgian state police officers, the
Brussels mayor and deputy mayor, two European soccer officials and
Albert Roosens, former secretary-general of the Belgian soccer
federation.
   Erauw said two of the 26 British suspects should be acquitted for
lack of proof and that he had ``reservations'' about eight other
British cases. He also asked that one case be severed from the other
British cases because the suspect is jailed in Britain on an
unrelated matter.
   The judge's decision is expected in March. If convicted of
involuntary manslaughter, the British suspects face up to 10 years
in jail, although Erauw has called for terms of only up to four
years.
   President Judge Peirre Verlynde still can override Erauw's
recommendations.
   However, a defense lawyer said convictions are unlikely against
the 10 suspects against whom the evidence was questioned by Erauw.
   ``He is effectively recommending the (complete acquittal) for
those defendants against whom he says guilt has not been established
to his satisfaction,'' said Sir Harry Livermore of Liverpool.
   But Erauw said two Belgian state police officials and Roosens
should be convicted. They face up to two years in jail.
   On Monday, he cited inadequate organization of the match by
Roosens, who was secretary-general of the Belgian soccer federation
at the time of the tragedy.
   He also blamed state police officers Johan Mahieu and Michel
Kensier for inadequate security measures and failing to act to stem
the rioting.
   On Tuesday, he said the Brussels mayor, his alderman for sports
matters and two officials of the Union of European Football
Associations should not be sentenced.
   The 26 Britons are accused of instigating Europe's worst-ever
soccer riot. The violence broke out on May 29, 1985, before a game
between Juventus Turin of Italy and FC Liverpool of England, the
final match of the European Champions' Cup at Brussels' Heysel
Stadium.
   The Britons were charged based on videotapes and photographs
taken of the rioting, which began when British soccer fans charged
into a neighboring section of the stands filled mostly with Italian
fans. About 500 people were hurt and 39, including 34 Italians, were
killed during the ensuing stampede.
   The British defendants are on trial after their government,
seeking to come to grips with soccer hooliganism, agreed to
extradite them. They are expected to be allowed to return home to
await the end of the trial that began Oct. 15.

   Children returned to class to confront
their fears with help from psychologists Wednesday, just one day
after a gunman fascinated by toy soldiers killed five youngsters at
the school he attended as a boy.
   Blood was washed from the pavement overnight and bullet holes
were patched at Cleveland Elementary School, where experts said it
was important that pupils, mostly children of Southeast Asian
refugees, deal with the trauma immediately.
   ``I still feel upset, but I have to bring my kid to see the
teacher to let the teacher know my kid's all right,'' Brom Lee said
in broken English. ``Everybody's angry. Your kid there, you get
angry too.''
   His daughter, 7-year-old Nary, said she was scared to return
because ``I saw blood.'' Holding tightly to her father's hand, she
pointed to her leg and said, ``I saw somebody get shot right here.''
   Police said Patrick Edward Purdy, wearing an olive-drab shirt
bearing the Iranian battle cry ``Death to the Great Satin (sic),''
on Tuesday sprayed more than 100 shots from an assault rifle,
killing five youngsters ages 6 to 9 and wounding 30 other people.
   A drifter who police said was either 24 or 26, Purdy killed
himself with a pistol shot to the head after the mute, methodical
attack during recess.
   ``Why he did this we may never know,'' said Capt. Dennis Perry.
``We can only assume that some problem came up in this guy that made
him do it. Obviously, he had a military hangup.''
   Carved into the stock of Purdy's rifle was the word Hezbollah,
Iranian for Party of God. Hezbollah is the name of a Shiite Moslem
faction in Lebanon. Also carved into the rifle were the words
``freedom'' and ``victory.''
   Perry said the man, in the days leading up to the bloodbath,
lived in a motel room where officers found a broken rifle, about 100
toy soldiers scattered about and an olive drab cloth on which were
drawn ``three snarling-type faces.''
   Records indicate that a Patrick Edward Purdy attended Cleveland
Elementary through third grade, from 1969 to 1973, said district
spokesman John Klose.
   As police pieced together his past, psychologists met with the
children as they returned to class today. Volunteers, some speaking
Cambodian or Laotian, were expected to act as translators.
   Bouquets were placed atop the school sign on the lawn, and five
red roses were laid at its base. Across the street, a 9-foot paper
sign read, ``Racists Are Ugly _ Let's Stop Them.''
   Perry said the only contact his department had with Purdy before
Tuesday was in 1986, when his mother called to complain that he and
his half brother had vandalized her car after she refused demands
for drug money.
   Purdy had a long police record, most of it in the Los Angeles
area, Perry said. Charges involved prostitution, marijuana,
manufacture or sale of an illegal weapon, receiving stolen property
and robbery, authorities said.
   Perry said he served jail time in at least the last two cases.
   Purdy had parked his station wagon behind the school and set it
ablaze with a Molotov cocktail Tuesday morning.
   He fired 106-110 shots from a bayonet-equipped, Chinese-made
AK-47 assault rifle at hundreds of youngsters enjoying a sunny
recess, reloading at least once.
   The semiautomatic rifle, purchased in August in Sandy, Ore., for
$147 was capable of firing as quickly as Purdy could pull the
trigger, police said.
   ``I don't understand why and I probably won't ever know why,''
said Purdy's grandmother, 63-year-old Julia Chumbley of Lodi. ``It's
like a nightmare. This sort of thing happens to others, not you.
Your own grandson.''
   Purdy, who often worked as a welder and used the alias Eddie
Purdy West, had apparently worked at a Stockton machine shop. Numeri
Tech president Dave Tankersley said he hired a man he knew as Eddie
West last January to ``sit there and drill holes.'' He worked there
for about a month.
   ``He was quiet. He always acted like he was sort of mad. You tell
him what to do _ give him a job _ he never smiled,'' Tankersley
said. ``In fact, I thought he was mad half the time.''
   A 6-year-old boy was in serious condition and 17 pupils and a
teacher were in stable condition. The others were treated at
hospitals or at the scene and were released.
   The 40-year-old neighborhood, near the University of the Pacific,
is home to many retired couples who raised their familes there, But
the culture has been changing with the influx of Southeast Asian
refugees.
   Southeast Asian pupils make up about 71 percent of the school's
enrollment of 986.
   About 100,000 Southeast Asians have immigrated to California's
300-mile long Central Valley because of its farming and fishing
industries and because of a climate similar to that of their native
countries.

<HEAD>Lebanon's Two Governments Try To Avoid Permanent Division of Nation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The heads of Lebanon's two rival
governments _ one Moslem, one Christian _ agreed to work with the
Arab League to try to prevent the split in the country from becoming
permanent, officials said Wednesday.
   Newspapers meanwhile said Wednesday that a commander from the
mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia was killed by Israeli tank
fire in south Lebanon and that a Syrian peacekeeping soldier was
killed in cross fire from an inter-Shiite clash in south Beirut.
   Lebanon has been torn by civil war for nearly 13 years. A
4-month-old political crisis threatens to solidify Lebanon's
partition into sectarian cantons.
   Salim Hoss, the acting prime Minister and head of the Moslem
Cabinet, told The Associated Press he will go to Tunis to confer
with a special committee of the league on Jan. 28 on how to settle
the political crisis here.
   Army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet,
``welcomed the Arab League's interest in the Lebanese situation and
expressed readiness to cooperate with the committee,'' a political
source in Christian east Beirut said on condition of anonymity.
   The office of Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini announced that
Husseini will also meet the committee in the Tunisian capital this
month.
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, and Husseini, a Shiite, were invited by
Kuwaiti envoys to meet the committee when they visited Damascus,
Syria, on Tuesday.
   The Christian source said Aoun ``would decide on the level of his
representation at a meeting with the committee after he formally
receives an invitation, which is expected later this week.''
   The league committee, created last Thursday in Tunis at a meeting
of Arab foreign ministers, is headed by Kuwait's foreign minister,
Sheik Sabah Ahmed Sabah.
   The committee of the 22-nation league will try to resolve the
Lebanese crisis and facilitate the election of a new president to
succeed Amin Gemayel, whose term expired Sept. 22.
   A squabbling Parliament failed to elect a successor to Gemayel,
and he chose Aoun to head an interim military Cabinet. Moslem
leaders backed by Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, refused
to recognize Aoun's new authority and backed a Cabinet under Hoss, a
leftover of Gemayel's splintered government.
   A communique from Amal leader Nabih Berri said that Amal's head
of operations in south Lebanon, Nabil Hijazi, was killed by a shell
from an Israeli tank Tuesday as he was leading a reconnaissance
mission near Sojod, north of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone.
   Berri's communique, published by all Beirut newspapers, said
Hijazi died while ``gathering intelligence information on the
security zone'' and proclaimed him a ``martyr.''
   The pro-Syrian Amal advocates guerrilla warfare to dislodge
Israel from the border enclave it carved out in south Lebanon in
1985.
   The leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir and the independent
An-Nahar said a Syrian soldier was killed Tuesday in cross fire
between Amal and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah organization in the
Bir Hasan residential district on Beirut's southern limits.
   The Syrian military refused to comment on the report.
   Amal and Hezbollah are struggling for control of the 1 million
Shiites who make up the largest sect among Lebanon's 4 million
inhabitants.

   Add one more to the list of things that can't
be kept secret in Washington.
   When a float that looks like a Navy boat rounds the corner of
15th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue in Friday's inaugural parade,
newly sworn-in President Bush is supposed to get one of the
surprises of his life.
   Navy men Wednesday draped black plastic over the float which is
topped with a newly painted Grumman Avenger aircraft like the one
that Bush was shot down in during World War II.
   But the men acknowledged the plane was no longer much of a
secret. There was at least one news story published about it, and
photographers were attracted to the shrouded object outside the
Smithsonian Air &amp; Space Museum.
   The idea, according to parade organizers, was to surprise Bush
with the aircraft and a dozen men from his old Navy torpedo squadron.
   The wingspan is so wide, Bush could almost reach out and touch it
from his reviewing stand, said a Navy officer watching over the
plane.
   He said trees along the parade route had to be trimmed to get the
plane through, and a couple of reviewing stands had to be moved back
to accommodate its 54-foot wingspan.
   The wings could be folded back, birdlike, but the officer said
parade officials wanted to be sure it could make it along the route
in full flying position.
   Bush was rescued from the Pacific Ocean on Sept. 2, 1944, after
he bailed out of his flaming Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber over the
Bonin Islands, 600 miles south of Japan. He won the Distinguished
Flying Cross for heroism during the bombing raid. His two crew
members were killed.
   The plane in the parade, built in the 1940s by General Motors on
a Grumman design, was flown to Washington after it was spotted in a
field by a World War II veteran working with the USS Yorktown
Association in Mt. Pleasant, S.C.
   Veterans from the Yorktown arranged for the plane to be in the
parade and also tracked down members of Bush's old torpedo squadron,
Air Group VT 51, to ride along with it, said Joseph Sharkey,
assistant director of the veterans group.
   About 10,000 Avengers were built, according to Grumman historian
Lois Louisolo, with 45 of the antique aircraft still registered to
fly.

<HEAD>Two Candidates for Premier Chosen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Croatian and a Serbian were chosen
Wednesday as the candidates to replace Premier Branko Mikulic, whose
government resigned Dec. 30 because it could not end the economic
crisis.
   Ante Markovic, member of Croatia's collective presidency, and
Borisav Jovic, speaker of Serbia's parliament, were named by the
Socialist Alliance, a Communist-led mass organization.
   Mikulic was the first premier to resign since the Communist Party
gained control at the end of World War II. Economic problems he was
unable to solve include high unemployment, an annual inflation rate
of 250 percent and a $21 billion foreign debt.
   Yugoslavia's nine-member collective presidency was expected to
choose the new premier on Thursday.
   Markovic, 64, is an electrical engineer and successful
businessman who has advocated market-oriented economic reforms
coupled with political change. He has the support of Slovenia and
Croatia, the most economically developed and Westward-looking of the
six republic.
   Jovic, 60, is an economists and close associate of Slobodan
Milosevic, chief of the Serbian Communist Party. He is believed to
have the support of poorer regions that fear economic reform would
close money-losing plants, causing mass layoffs.
   The nation's living standard has dwindled to half what it was
when President Tito died in 1980, causing widespread discontent
among workers. A record 1,400 strikes were reported last year.

   A gunman wounded a Supreme Court prosecutor
on Wednesday, the second major attack on a leading Greek magistrate
in eight days, police said.
   Panayiotis Tarasouleas, 66, was shot three times in the legs as
he was getting into his car at 8:05 p.m. outside his home in the
northern suburb of Maroussi, said Giorgos Vassilopoulos, chief of
the Athens security police.
   Vassilopoulos said the leftist November 17 terrorist group
claimed responsibility for the shooting in leaflets found at the
scene.
   ``The prosecutor and wife were going out for the evening and, as
they approached their car, three men accosted them and one shot him
in the legs,'' Vassilopoulos said. The three fled.
   Tarasouleas was in stable condition at the Athens Medical Center,
said Dr. Constantinos Economou, the hospital director.
   November 17 has claimed responsibility for 12 killings. The group
is named for the day in 1973 when troops crushed a student rebellion
against the 1967-74 military dictatorship.
   November 17 said it was responsible for the death in June of U.S.
Navy Capt. William E. Nordeen, the military attache at the U.S.
Embassy in Athens.
   The organization first became known in 1975, when it claimed
responsibility for the assassination of Richard Welch, the CIA
station chief in Greece.
   In a June 10 attack, three gunmen wounded Constantinos
Androulidakis, 52, a prominent Athens investigating magistrate, as
he was leaving his home for work.
   Androulidakis, known for his tough stand on terrorism, was shot
twice in the legs and once in the arm. He was in stable condition
Wednesday.
   The previously unknown ``Popular Anti-State Groups For Fiery
Action'' claimed responsibility for the attack.

   The governments of Israel and Iraq both denied
reports on Wednesday that Israel threatened to bomb an Iraqi factory
outside Baghdad if it manufactured biological weapons.
   They were responding to ABC-TV reports out of Washington earlier
Wednesday saying that Israel warned Iraq through the U.S. government
that it was planning a strike against such a facility.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted an Iraqi Foreign Ministry
official as saying that Iraq does not produce such weaopns.
   ``If we receive such a threat, Iraq will reject it strongly,''
the agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, quoted the unidentified
official as saying.
   Motti Amihai, spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said:
``There is no truth to that information that we did threaten Iraq.''
He also said Israel did not ask the United States or any other
country to pass along any such warning.
   Amihai said Israel was studying the reports that the Iraqi
government was developing biological weapons. ``If this information
is true, we are facing here one more proof of the irresponsibility
of the Iraqi government.''
   Amihai refused to comment on Israel's knowledge of the Iraqi
plant. Israeli sources said this month that Iraq is on the verge of
developing biological weapons, but has not yet produced any.
   When asked if Israel would consider an air raid similar to the
1981 attack that destroyed an Iraqi nuclear facility, Amihai replied:
   ``One should bear in mind that Israel is very sensitive about its
security. ... We will take all measures necessary to ensure the
security of the state of Israel.''
   He was referring to Israel's June 1981 air strike that destroyed
an Iraqi nuclear research facility at Tuwaitha outside Baghdad.
Israel contended that Iraq would use enriched uranium from the
reactor to produce nuclear weapons.

   Heavy rain flooded streets Wednesday in Houston, Texas, and snow
was scattered around most of the Great Lakes.
   Elsewhere, the sky was sunny and temperatures were near
seasonably normal levels over much of the nation through midday.
   Occasional thunderstorms dropped more than 4 inches of rain
during the morning at Houston, flooding some streets and stalling
cars.
   Rain and thunderstorms were scattered from the Texas Gulf Coast
and eastern Texas across Louisiana, southern Mississippi and
southwestern Alabama by early afternoon.
   During the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, 2.20 inches of rain fell
at Ellington Air Force Base near Houston, and 1.06 inches fell at
Alexandria, La.
   Snow showers were scattered from northwestern New York state
across northern Lower Michigan, Upper Michigan, Wisconsin and
northeastern Minnesota. Upper Michigan got up to 4 inches of snow
during the night and into the morning.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 4
degrees above zero at Gunnison, Colo., to 81 at Miami. Wednesday
morning's low temperature in the lower 48 states was 23 degrees
below zero at Gunnison.
   For Thursday, snow showers were forecast from northeastern New
York state across northern New England, with snow changing to rain
along the central coast of New England. Snow showers also were
forecast from northeastern Minnesota across Upper Michigan. Rain and
occasional thundershowers were forecast over eastern and central
Texas.
   Highs in the 20s and 30s were predicted over northern New
England, northeastern New York state, the Great Lakes, the upper
Mississippi Valley, much of the northern Plains, the Rockies and the
Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah; in the 40s over southern New
England and New Jersey, the central Plains and the northern Pacific
Coast; in the 70s over the Florida Peninsula, the lower Texas Gulf
Coast and from southern Arizona across the southern coast of
California; and in the 50s and 60s over the remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>Students Suggest How Roosevelt U. Should Spend $2.75 million Gift
for Fun</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roosevelt University graduate just wanted
students to have fun. And he left $2.75 million to make sure.
   ``What a guy,'' said Jeff Rosenberg, 24, a senior majoring in
sociology. ``They should use it to hold cheap concerts with good
groups. Nothing big _ a reunion of (rock group) Led Zeppelin or
something like that.''
   Hollywood agent Marvin Moss, 59, died of cancer in 1986 in Los
Angeles. He left the bulk of his estate to Roosevelt, saying the
money should be spent only on social and recreational amenities
because ``as a city-type school, I never felt students socialized as
much as they might have.''
   On Wednesday, some of the 6,000 students at the private, liberal
arts school offered some ideas for spending the gift, which
officials said was the largest in the school's 43-year history.
   Moss' gift will pay for a gymnasium and fitness center and
renovatations to student lounges, said Roosevelt President Theodore
Gross. About $400,000 will be set aside to create a student
activities fund, Gross said.
   Some students said the funds were needed to add enthusiasm to
student gatherings.
   ``They should have parties at nice hotels and get a DJ who knows
how to play really good music,'' said Beatrice Franklin, a junior
studying biology.
   ``We need better food,'' Daryl McLaurine, 21, said, patting his
stomach. ``I like food.''
   Moss represented actress Shirley MacLaine, the late actor Desi
Arnaz and John Avildsen, who directed the movie ``Rocky.'' He
graduated in 1948 from Roosevelt with a degree in commerce.
   Roosevelt has received $2.25 million and expects to get the
remaining $500,000 in about a year, said Robert Shepard, vice
president for development.
   ``Mr. Moss was a modest donor every year and we tried to convince
him to contribute more,'' Shepard said. ``He told us, `Don't worry,
you're in my will and someday you'll be rich.'''
   The gift to Roosevelt was not the only bequest Moss made to give
people a good time.
   He was a member of the Los Angeles Wine and Food Society and had
an outstanding wine cellar, which he left to the University of
California, said his lawyer, Daniel Sklar.
   He also left $20,000 for a black-tie party for his friends and
business associates in Beverly Hills, Calif., said Susan Whyberd, a
friend.

<HEAD>MIT Study: Nuclear Plants Work Better Overseas Because Of Amity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American nuclear plants perform worse than foreign
ones because of a lack of cooperation among U.S. utilities and
hostility between them and regulators, says a Massachusetts
Institute of Technology study.
   ``What the (U.S.) utilities don't seem to have, typically, is a
culture of reaching out to one another on a company-by-company
basis,'' said professor Michael Golay, a nuclear engineer and one of
the report's authors.
   The report, financed by the U.S. Department of Energy, MIT and
two electric companies, was to be released Thursday in the latest
issue of the school magazine Technology Review.
   The study looked at plants in Japan, Sweden, France, Switzerland,
West Germany and the United States from 1975 to 1984. In the United
States it examined the nearly 200 light water reactors producing
more than 300 megawatts.
   The average plant in the United States produced energy less than
60 percent of the time, while most of the other countries at the end
of the period were at 75 percent, said MIT professor Kent Hansen,
the project's chief author.
   ``One of our conjectures is that all elements concerned with
nuclear power have not been able to work together to solve nuclear
problems,'' Hansen said.
   Golay said that when Japan decided to improve the available of
nuclear-generated power, ``they did it by making it a national goal.
The U.S. has tried to do some of that, but so far, in terms of
availability, it has failed.''
   ``What is unique to the United States is a highly antagonistic
relationship between regulators and utilities,'' the report said.
   ``In other countries, relationships between regulators and
utilities become strained at times, but all parties report that
communication is open and forthright, with no group withholding
information or acting secretly or vindictively. ... Nor do
politicians attempt to interfere in regulatory decisions.''
   Golay said much of the hostility ``is the consequence of
operating in a goldfish bowl. In other countries they operate behind
closed doors.''
   Nuclear industry spokesman Scott Peters agreed with the
assessment of 60 percent efficiency. But in a telephone interview
from the U.S. Council for Energy Awareness in Washington, he said,
``We're getting better.''
   As for cooperation among utilities, after the 1979 accident at
Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, utilities set up a computer link
to share information, and the industry also has established the
Institute of Nuclear Power Operators.
   He noted that in France, where nuclear power facilities are
considered outstanding, the government owns the utility.
   ``That's a fairly simple relationship. Ours is more complex. The
Nuclear Regulatory Commission is careful not to get too close to the
industry. There's an arm's length (relationship), as it should be,''
he said.
   But he added, ``I don't think it's contributing to inefficency.''

<TEXT>
   Fire-retardant plywood used to build roofs on
thousands of multiple-family dwellings nationwide can weaken and
collapse after prolonged exposure to the sun's heat, building
industry officials said Wednesday.
   ``It really is not the type of problem where people will have to
worry about their roofs caving in on them at night when they're
sleeping,'' said Marshall Frost, a civil engineer and president of
Frost, Christenson and Associates in Florham Park.
   But builders say the fire-retardant plywood weakens after five to
six years and starts to sag, and could collapse under the weight of
heavy snow.
   Fire-retardant plywood is marketed by several companies under
various brand names. Each company uses a different compound to
impregnate the wood to resist fire.
   The treated plywood has been used for roofing for more then a
decade in multiple-family dwellings, to keep fire from bypassing
firewalls and spreading easily across the roofs of adjacent
apartments, but officials only recently realized there was a problem.
   The American Plywood Association of Tacoma, Wash., said it first
learned of the problem in 1986 when it began to get complaints from
engineers.
   ``These were totally different than any other thing we'd ever
heard about,'' said Steve Zylkowski, an APA scientist. ``We didn't
know what to attribute the problem to.''
   Inspectors found the problem was a chemical reaction in the fire
retardant chemicals caused by the sun's heat, Zylkowski said. The
chemical reaction produces an acid that weakens the wood over
several years.
   A committee formed by the National Association of Home Builders
will meet Sunday in Atlanta to discuss a solution.
   The New Jersey Builders Association and the national plywood
group are advising builders to refrain from using fire-retardant
wood until researchers at the National Forest Products Association
laboratory in Madison, Wis., can determine what chemicals are
causing the wood deterioration.
   ``Until the industry comes up with meaningful controls to control
their problems, we will not recommend use of their products,''
Zylkowski said. ``If they do have a problem, we recommend strongly
that they get assurance from the treatment companies that the
problem will not recur.''
   Meanwhile, builders suggest annual inspections of roofs.
   Many suppliers and chemical manufacturers are working with the
forest products association to develop a testing method for the
fire-retardant chemicals, said Susan LeVan, a researcher for the
group.
   Ms. LeVan said 6,000 specimens of plywood are being tested.
   ``We hope to be able to prove that if you know certain lengths of
time that the wood is at elevated temperatures, we will be able to
predict the life of the wood,'' she said.
   The next problem is who should pay for replacing faulty materials
which have been used in thousands of dwellings.
   ``That's a $64,000 question,'' Frost said. ``Somewhere along the
line, the courts will figure out who is responsible to fix it. There
are a lot of discussions going on in the industry. I think the
industry will find a solution which might require some changes.''

   Two masked gunmen killed a store
clerk and a car bomb blew up outside a courthouse in separate
attacks on Wednesday, police said.
   The clerk was slain in Belfast's Smithfield Market area and was
dead on arrival at Royal Victoria Hospital, said a Royal Ulster
Constabulary spokesman.
   Police would not identify the victim, but Press Association, the
domestic British news agency, said he was Ian Catney, 25, a Roman
Catholic who was working in his mother's store.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the shooting or the
bombing.
   The blast occurred outside the high-security Crumlin Road
courthouse. There were no injuries, said a spokesman for the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, requesting anonymity. Damage was slight, he
said.
   The bomb had been placed in a hijacked car taken from a family
held hostage in the Springfield Road area of mainly Roman Catholic
west Belfast, he said.

   After a disastrous train-school bus
collision, the president on Wednesday ordered gates installed at all
758 rail crossings in Sri Lanka and guards posted at all times, a
spokesman said.
   Presidential spokesman Festus Perera said that at a Cabinet
meeting, President Ranasinghe Premadasa specified that the gate
installation be completed by Monday.
   Wailing relatives claimed most of the dead on Wednesday from the
collision in southern Sri Lanka that killed at least 45 people and
injured 68, most of them children.
   Other kin searched hospitals hoping to find their loved ones
alive.
   M.S. Amarasiri, chief minister of the southern provincial
council, said funerals were scheduled to take place Thursday. He
said most homes, shops and vehicles flew white flags on Wednesday to
mourn the dead.
   An express train slammed into a schoolbus carrying about 120
passengers Tuesday at an unprotected rail crossing near Ahungalla,
about 50 miles south of Colombo, police and witnesses said.
   The government said 41 people were killed outright and four died
at hospitals. Authorities said most were children ranging in age
from 5 to 15. Six critically injured people were brought to the
capital for emergency surgery.
   Relatives crowded into government-run hospitals in Galle and
Balapitiya, where the dead and injured were taken.
   Premadasa's wife, Hema, visited the accident site and hospitals
Wednesday, going from bed to bed to comfort the injured and console
relatives of the dead.
   Many victims were mutilated beyond recognition. Nurses asked
families to check clothing for identification.
   Police searched bloodstained schoolbooks and schoolbags for clues
to identify victims.
   The school bus picked up children and teachers from four schools
in Amblangoda on Tuesday and headed toward Urgasmanhandiya, about 10
miles away.
   The driver tried to cross the tracks as the train was approaching
the crossing but the bus engine apparently stalled, police and
witnesses said.
   Five children sitting on bus steps jumped to safety.
   The train, going about 40 mph, hit the bus and knocked it about
150 feet down the track, witnesses said.
   The bus driver escaped with minor cuts and bruises, police said.
   No one on the train was hurt, they reported.

   When devastating urban rioting hit Miami in 1980,
few police officers had special training and the city paid for it.
   ``In 1980, we had the worst riot in the history of the United
States. It started with murder and got worse. There were short
budgets, police departments were understaffed,'' said George Green,
46, who retired from the department as a captain in 1985.
   In the racial violence of 1989, however, the Miami and Metro Dade
police have a plan, thanks to Green.
   ``I would say Miami is one of the few towns that has citizens who
are disturbance-trained,'' said Miami police spokesman Sgt. David
Rivero. ``They know what to do. That's an unfortunate thing to say
about this town, but it's a fact.''
   In 1980, when riots that killed 18 people and injured hundreds
hit the Liberty City neighborhood, the Miami police force had only
670 officers and there was no master plan.
   People traveling through the riot area were dragged from their
cars and killed, some even mutilated. Police officers were trapped
alone, barriers weren't set up properly.
   ``It was a whole bunch of police officers trying to do the job,
but not as a cohesive group,'' said Green.
   ``If things could go wrong, they probably did,'' he said. ``But
those lessons were well-learned.''
   Today, police move in coordinated ``field force'' units, groups
of eight or more cars with four men in each. Squad leaders are
named. Each officer has certain duties: some watch the cars, others
carry the tear gas, others drive.
   Whenever one car in the field force moves, all of the cars move.
Quick action is taken to set up perimeters, limiting movement of
people into and out of a trouble zone.
   Rivero says the force is trained for about 10 hours every six
months. ``We go out and pretend that we're out there fighting a
disturbance, have policeman posing as rioters.''
   Green suggested after the 1980 riots that a new approach was
needed and was told: ``You are elected. You are now known as the
urban crisis officer.''
   It turned out to be a prudent move.
   ``The biggest thing that became apparent to me was that police
officers on a daily basis are trained to deal with the public in a
positive manner,'' he said. ``But in a civil disorder it is the
police against the citizens.
   ``It's difficult to go from service-oriented to a military-type
approach,'' he said.
   He read military literature and considered the tools available.
The field force system he developed for Miami became a popular one
in law enforcement.
   Dade County adopted the system. Tampa adopted elements of it.
Officials from Chicago, Los Angeles and New Orleans and England have
studed the approach.

   President-elect Bush splashed his inaugural
limelight on school teachers Wednesday, promising to use the White
House to reward excellence and raise standards in America's schools
and to rivet the nation's attention on reforming education.
   ``I am awed by your work,'' he told 238 teachers invited from
every state as special guests for the inauguration. Many of them, in
turn, seemed awed by the glowing tribute from the next president.
One called it ``breath-taking.''
   Even under budgetary constraints, Bush said, ``we're going to
work to make sure that the nation does what needs to be done for our
schools: reward excellence, raise standards, expand choice,
publicize success, strive to resolve shortcomings and keep American
attention and effort concentrated on further education reform and
improvement.''
   Later, at a gathering of Republican party leaders, Bush paid
tribute to President Reagan, declaring that he could never have won
the election without his help.
   And, as the sun set on a warm winter's day that seemed like
springtime, the president-elect presidd over a spectacular ceremony
at the Lincoln Memorial that began with the blare of military
trumpets and ended with the brilliant thunder of fireworks that sent
a flock of geese scurrying over the Reflecting Pool.
   When the Beach Boys played ``Help Me, Rhonda,'' several of Bush's
youngest grandchildren danced before their delighted elders.
   The ceremony featured a flyover by 21 military jets, a precision
landing by four Army parachutists, and a rendition of ``God Bless
the U.S.A.'' by Lee Greenwood that Bush said sent chills down his
spine. Then Bush came forward and delivered a brief, poignant speech.
   He recited Lincoln's words engraved on the walls of the memorial:
``Government of the people, by the people and for the people.''
   ``That is the kind of government I plan to lead,'' he said. ``I
will try hard to be a president of all the people.''
   He paid homage to Ronald Reagan and his ``great presidency'' that
has made America ``strong once again,'' but said ``the job is not
complete. Some are still hurting and we care ... So let this
inauguration be a time to celebrate who we are, but let it also be a
time to remember who we can be.''
   The crowd shone miniature flashlights at Bush's command, bringing
his ``thousand points of life'' to life, a symbol of ``my vision of
America's greatness ... everyone who pitches in and builds up.''
   From the Lincoln Memorial, Bush and Vice President-elect Dan
Quayle went to the headquarters of the Department of Health and
Human Services, where Bush pledged to bring the disabled into the
mainstream of American life.
   He told the gathering of 500 people, many of them blind or in
wheelchairs, that the disabled ``have been excluded for too long
from the mainstream.'' He promised to ``do what I can ... to correct
all of that.''
   Bush attended a reunion at his new temporary quarters at Blair
House with the World War II submarine crewmen who rescued him as a
downed flier in the Pacific, then capped the day off by making the
rounds of a trio of a trio of $1,500-a-plate inaugural dinners.
   But Bush chose to start the five-day whirlwind of official
inaugural activities with a speech at a forum honoring 238 top
teachers drawn from state teachers of the year, union leaders and
others chosen by governors and Republican advisory committees.
   Reiterating his pledge to be ``the education president,'' Bush
told the educators, ``My most important message to America's
teachers is a message of appreciation.''
   ``This is my very first event on the inaugural calendar,'' Bush
told the teachers at the National Museum of Women in the Arts.
``That's the way I wanted it, meeting with educators.''
   ``Education will be on my desk and on my mind right from the
start, every day,'' he promised.
   ``I am awed by your work and it is tough work and it's
indispensable work and it deserves as much praise and thanks as any
job in any profession in America. ... Certainly you deserve more
public recognition than you usually get.''
   Then, expressing a thought often spoken by his defeated
Democratic rival, Michael Dukakis, during the campaign, Bush added,
``Teaching should be one of America's honored professions and I will
work to make sure that it is exactly that.''
   Paul Parets, a band teacher at Alexis I. DuPont High School in
Wilmington, Del., called the Bush speech ``really a very
breath-taking experience.''
   ``I sat there thinking he could have met with the heads of
foreign states, he could have met with the leaders of the military
or the captains of industry and instead he chose to meet with ...
teachers from across the United States,'' said Parets, a past
Delaware teacher of the year whose high school band will march in
the inaugural parade.
   Moving on to the Republican National Committee luncheon where his
campaign chairman, Lee Atwater, was installed as the new party
chief, Bush offered warm praise for Reagan, whom he said was leaving
office with a 68 percent approval rating.
   ``It speaks so much about the man and his accomoplishments. ...
'' Bush said. ``I don't believe I'd be standing here as president
eleect of the United States if it hadn't been for the way President
Reagan treated me as vice president and then the way he rolled up
his sleeves and went to work in many of your states helping his vice
president be elected.''
   ``When I go say farewell to him tomorrow, it won't be too easy,''
he said.
   Bush also joked that he was glad to be out of the house on a day
when the family belongings were being moved out of their residence
of the past eight years, the Naval Observatory mansion. He said he
was purposely giving his wife Barbara ``a little elbow room.''
   ``She's getting tough around the house,'' said Bush. ``See a
half-filled crate and she puts me to work and she's mean and tough
and ugly about it. She doesn't show any understanding.''
   ``I don't care if I see her for another 48 hours, because I know
there'll be another crate that she (will say): `Move this one over
here,''' he quipped. ``Getting tired of that. After all I got big
responsibilities being put on my shoulders.''

   Government troops clashed with rebels
at least 20 times Jan. 9-16, and at least 17 people were killed,
military sources said Wednesday.
   The fighting was in the southwestern provinces of Boaco,
Chontales and Rio San Juan. The area has been the focus of activity
by the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, since the rebels and
the leftist Sandinista government signed a tentative cease-fire
agreement last March.
   At least 13 rebels and four soldiers were killed and three
soldiers were wounded, the sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The Defense Ministry, meanwhile, accused Honduran troops of
shooting toward the border post of Murupuchi, in northern Nueva
Segovia province, on Sunday. It mentioned no casualties.
   Nicaragua says the post is harassed almost daily by Honduran
troops.
   Col. Manuel Suarez Benavides, chief spokesman for the Honduran
armed forces, called the allegations ``absolutely false'' and said
they ``apparently form part of a new Nicaraguan propaganda offensive
against Honduras.''
   ``It also is completely false that Honduran troops have
repeatedly harassed Sandinista forces in Murupuchi,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   A series of Sandinista-Contra meetings after the March 23 signing
of the temporary truce failed to define terms for a permanent
agreement. Talks broke off on June 9.
   Fighting declined sharply after the signing, which came a month
after the United States cut off military aid to the Contras. Most of
the rebels moved back to base camps in Honduras, but sporadic
fighting continues.

   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle praised
President-elect Bush on Wednesday for ``a capacity to lead'' and in
return received Bush's public commitment that he will be included in
the workings of the new administration.
   Quayle, who has remained largely out of sight during the
transition period, spoke briefly to members of the Republican
National Committee which was meeting in Washington amid the
inaugural festivities.
   He then listened as Bush described both his own treatment as vice
president under Ronald Reagan and his plans for dealing the same way
with Quayle.
   ``I don't believe I'd be standing here as president-elect of the
United States if it hadn't been for the way President Reagan treated
me as vice president,'' Bush told the luncheon crowd at a Washington
hotel.
   Turning then to Quayle, Bush said, ``As for my vice president,
Dan Quayle, I'm excited about working with him, and what we're going
to do is use exactly the same formula that the Reagan-Bush team had.
And he will be included.''
   ``He will do specific assignments that will develop in time,''
Bush said. ``He will take on special missions. He will have full
access to the president of the United States and he is going to be
an outstanding vice president of the United States.''
   Quayle praised Bush as ``a person of immense capabilities,
integrity, knowledge and a capacity to lead. ... There isn't a
better man to lead this nation forward in the challenges ahead than
George Bush.''
   The former Indiana senator spoke briefly of the administration he
will be a part of, promising to ``maintain our commitment to the
basic philosophical principles that brought us here.''
   But he also said they must face ``the challenges of tomorrow head
on.'' He cited the area of defense, ``where we will have to do more
with less, we will have to be smarter.''
   Later, at a ceremony at the Department of Health and Human
Services, Quayle told an audience of about 1,000 disabled and
handicapped Americans that the new administration's commitment to
them is ``deep and it is wide.'' The reception was hosted by Access
to Opportunity, a bipartisan advocacy group for the disabled.
   The vice president-elect pledged that he and Bush will work to
assure that the disabled will be ``included in the mainstream of
American life.''
   ``For too long, they've been left out, but they're not going to
be left out any more,'' he said. ``I can tell you this commitment is
deep and it is wide.''
   ``Without aggressive public and private support disabled people
cannot achieve their dreams of independence, gain full control over
their lives and integrate into the mainstream of American life,''
Quayle said.
   He said the Bush administration will ask the private sector ``to
aggressively hire disabled people'' and will educate employers about
the disabled and let them know that ``disabled people perform above
the average.''
   He also said they would work with Congress to eliminate obstacles
that discourage disabled people from working and support initiatives
to train the disabled for jobs.
   ``Today, I reaffirm support for the cause of the disabled. We
want to inaugurate an era of new hope and opportunity for all
Americans.
   ``It is not only the right thing to do, it is also the smart
thing to do,'' he said.

   Jury selection began Wednesday in the
trial of one of two men charged in 11 sniper attacks on isolated
homes in the Blackstone Valley north of here.
   Jurors were told the trial could take six weeks and include as
many as 60 witnesses.
   Jury selection began after Superior Court Judge Dominic F. Cresto
denied a motion by Peter T. Trepanier's attorneys to dismiss the
charges because of lengthy trial delays. He also dismissed a defense
motion to delay the trial still further because of alleged
prejudicial pretrial publicity.
   A group of about 70 potential jurors filled the courtroom as Eva
Marie Mancuso, assistant attorney general, read a list of the dozens
of witnesses who could be called to testify.
   Trepanier, 25, and a second defendant, Russell J. Ducharme II,
24, face 39 charges each, including arson and assault with intent to
commit murder. The charges stem from a series of attacks on isolated
homes in the Woonsocket area in December 1986 and January 1987.
   Both men, if convicted, could face maximum sentences of life in
prison.
   Six potential jurors Wednesday were asked if they were familar
with any of the witnesses or if they had ever been victims of crimes.
   The prospective jurors also were questioned about whether any of
the extensive publicity about the case would color their judgment.
Two people were dismissed, but for unrelated personal reasons.
   Defense lawyers, citing pretrial publicity, tried unsuccessfully
last summer to have the trial moved from Providence.
   Trepanier, of Burrillville, surrendered to police in October
1987, 10 months after the last shooting was reported in North
Smithfield.
   Ducharme, of Smithfield, was arrested and charged the next day.
His trial is set to begin March 13.

   Attorneys who want to save Theodore Bundy
from Florida's electric chair next week filed a Circuit Court appeal
Wednesday, and a hearing was scheduled for Thursday morning, court
officials said.
   ``They've raised three claims for relief,'' said Carolyn
Snurkowski, chief death penalty attorney for Florida's attorney
general office.
   Two of the arguments deal with Bundy's murder convictions in the
deaths of two sorority sisters at Florida State University, Ms.
Snurkowski said. The third deals with Bundy's mental state.
   Bundy, 42, is scheduled to die Tuesday for the February 1978
murder of Kimberly Leach, a 12-year-old Lake City girl.
   His lawyers say the question of Bundy's sanity is not settled
though the U.S. Supreme Court refused Tuesday to consider the issue
in the Lake City case.
   The lawyers say that Bundy's two other Florida cases should be
linked to the Lake City case on the question of his sanity. Bundy,
42, also is under death sentences for fatally bludgeoning two
Florida State University sorority sisters three weeks before Leach
was killed.
   In 1979, Bundy was declared legally sane to stand trial for the
sorority murders. That ruling was used recently by appeals courts to
reject Bundy's claim that he is insane and should not be executed
for the Leach murder.
   On Dec. 12, U.S. District Judge William Zloch in Fort Lauderdale
reopened the sanity issue in the sorority case, saying he would hear
evidence as early as Monday.
   Bundy's lawyers say that decision leaves Bundy's sanity in doubt
and that he should not be executed until it is resolved.
   Defense lawyers and prosecutors have asked for a delay in the
federal court hearing while they deal with the death warrant.

<TEXT>
   Suspected leftist guerrillas armed with
sticks of dynamite and automatic weapons ambushed a judicial
commission Wednesday, killing two judges and 11 other people, the
army said.
   Two police officers were wounded in the attack near
Barrancabermeja, a port city on the Magdalena River for oil
shipments, 160 miles northeast of the capital, military authorities
said.
   The panel was investigating the October 1987 disappearance of 17
merchants along with more than $235,000 in goods.
   The commission consisted of the judges, 35-year-old Mariela
Morales and 40-year-old Pablo Beltran; two secretaries, nine
judicial police officers and two drivers. The two survivors arrived
in Barrancabermeja, Colombia's largest eastern city, where they told
authorities of the attack.
   ``It is an unprecedented attack on investigators who did not
constitute an attack force,'' said Carlos Eduardo Lozano, director
of criminal judges.
   Army and police reports said the attackers exploded dynamite
buried under a road where two vehicles carrying the judicial
commission passed by, then sprayed the group with automatic weapons
fire.
   The two wounded officers were taken to the hospital of the
state-owned oil company Ecopetrol, where officials said they were
out of danger.
   Gen. Yanine Daz, commander of the army's Second Division, said
from Bucaramanga that the guerrillas belonged to the Revoloutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a communist group. But police
blamed the attack on the Army of National Liberation, or ELN, a
group inspired by Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   Both groups operate in the region, known as the central Magdalena
River area. Ultra-right paramilitary groups claiming to fight
subversives and leftist collaborators have also been known to
operate in the area.
   It is the first time leftist guerrillas were blamed for killing
judicial officials, although drug traffickers have killed Supreme
Court magistrates and judges investigating drug-related crimes.

   Tony Ridley, who resigned as London transport chief
because of a disastrous subway fire, was chosen Wednesday as joint
managing director by the consortium building an undersea rail link
between England and France.
   Relatives of people killed in the subway fire objected.
   Ridley resigned 10 weeks ago as head of London Regional
Transport, which runs the subways, when an official report cited
executive complacency as a factor in the blaze that killed 31 people
Nov. 18, 1987.
   ``My first reaction was, well, I'm certainly not going to use the
tunnel,'' said Sophie Tarassenko, whose brother Ivan was killed in
the escalator fire at the busy King's Cross station.
   ``It seems to me safety is paramount in such a thing as the
channel tunnel ... and to have such a man appointed seems a very odd
decision,'' she said.
   Miss Tarassenko is chairwoman of the King's Cross Families Action
Group formed after the fire.
   The official report said management was ``fundamentally in
error'' in considering fires inevitable and that it had not put a
high priority on safety.
   Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French consortium boring the undersea link
beneath the English Channel, said Wednesday it chose Ridley and
Alain Bertrand as joint managing directors. The tunnel is scheduled
to open in 1993.

<HEAD>Order Could Shield White House Papers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's successors would have the
power to shield portions of the papers of the Reagan presidency from
disclosure, under an executive order issued by the president
Wednesday.
   The order spells out procedures to be followed by Reagan and
other former presidents in claiming executive privilege with regard
to their presidential papers.
   These claims would be subject to review by the archivist, but the
archivist would be bound by any instructions given him by the
incumbent president unless otherwise instructed by court order.
   Thus, if Reagan asserted executive privilege to keep some of his
papers under wraps, and a later president supported him, the
archivist would be prohibited from disclosing them unless ordered by
a court.
   The order arises out of protracted litigation over claims of
executive privilege by former President Nixon with regard to his
papers.
   A Justice Department opinion in 1986 said the archivist is a
presidential appointee and must comply with the president's claim of
privilege, even when it is invoked in support of a former president.
That opinion also said an incumbent president was bound to support
an executive privilege claim by a former president, except in rare
cases when it would conflict with his constitutional duties.
   The opinion touched off criticism in Congress, where some
lawmakers said it would let Reagan and future presidents keep their
own papers under seal years after they have left office.
   Reagan's order establishes procedures governing the assertion of
executive privilege by both present and former presidents.
   It provides that when the archivist decides on release of papers
of a former president, he would notify both the former president and
the incumbent, identifying any materials he thinks might be subject
to executive privilege.
   The incumbent and former presidents, however, would be free to
assert executive privilege with regard to any papers, whether or not
identified by the archivist.
   The archivist would be free to release the papers if he did not
receive a claim of executive privilege within 30 days.
   If he received such a claim from the incumbent president, he
would be prohibited from disclosing the records unless directed to
do so by the president or a final court order.
   When he received a claim of privilege by a former president, the
archivist would consult with the attorney general and the counsel to
the president and then make a ``determination as to whether to honor
the former president's claim of privilege or instead to disclose the
presidential records notwithstanding the claim of privilege.''
   ``Any determination ... that executive privilege shall not be
invoked by the incumbent president shall not prejudice the
archivist's determination with respect to the former president's
claim of privilege,'' the order said.
   However, it said, ``In making the determination ... the archivist
shall abide by any instructions given him by the incumbent president
or his designee unless otherwise directed by a final court order.''
   All presidents before Nixon took their papers with them when they
left office, but under a 1978 law Reagan's documents and those of
his successors will become public property. That law requires the
archivist to decide which papers to withhold and which to make
public 12 years after a president leaves office.

<HEAD>South Korea Agrees to Buy More US Wine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea will drop barriers to imports of
U.S. wine and U.S. vintners have dropped their plea to President
Reagan for action against the barriers, U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter announced Wednesday.
   ``The agreement opens an important new market for American wine
at an early stage in that market's development and it assures that
our wine industry can compete fairly with Korean wine producers,''
said a statement by Yeutter, who will be Agriculture secretary in
the incoming Bush administration.
   The American Wine Institute had appealed to Reagan under a law
which lets him retaliate against the trade of countries that damage
or threaten U.S. industry.
   According to the announcement, the South Korean government is to
lift immediately its ban on wine coolers, dessert wines and
fortified wines, and will double its import quota for all wine
products. Beginning in 1990, it will lift restrictions on table
wines, wine coolers -- mixtures of wine and fruit juice -- and
fruit-flavored wines.
   Yeutter added that the South Korean government has agreed to ask
the National Assembly to lower the tax rate on wine coolers to 25
percent from 40 percent.
   In January 1991 the ban on champagne and brandy will disappear.
   Early last year, the South Korean tariff on wine products stood
at 100 percent of their value. The current rate of 50 percent will
drop to 35 percent in July and to 30 percent in January 1990. The
rate on wine coolers will drop to 25 percent.
   Yeutter's announcement said U.S. products will have equal access
to the South Korean distribution system and U.S. companies will have
the right to set up their own networks for American products,
through Korean agents. In 1991 Americans will get the right to
invest directly in importing and wholesale activities on U.S. wines.
   It took three rounds of negotiations to settle the dispute. The
agreement on Wednesday was contained in an exchange of letters,
Yeutter's office said..

   Members of Iran's Parliament on Wednesday
demanded a tougher judiciary system that would crack down on

   Iran's official news agency, monitored in Nicosia, said a letter
to the judiciary signed by 190 lawmakers read, ``It is in the
interest of the county to strengthen the judiciary as soon as
possible according to the leader of the Islamic revolution,
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.''
   IRNA said the letter advised the judiciary to heed the warning,
adding that failure to do so could cause irreparable harm.
   The call reflects public concern over government graft and other
issues put to one side after the Iran-Iraq war began in September
1980.
   Parliament deputy Rajai Khorasani told students in northwestern
Tabriz province last month that corruption was a major reason for
Iran's agreeing to a U.N.-mediated cease-fire last August.
   Last month Parliament came under attack for voting down a bill
demanding that all government officials' incomes be investigated.
   Members opposing the measure, among them Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said it was too far-reaching in requiring that
medium-level officials such as bank managers and heads of
state-owned corporations be investigated.
   In an effort to demonstrate a tough stand on corruption, however,
the government last month sentenced multimillionaire Ali Mousavi to
death for defrauding war victims' families.
   Also, an Expediency Council formed by Khomeini to expedite
legislation bypassed both judiciary and Parliament in passing a
draconian law against drug smugglers.
   The new law, to take effect at the end of this week, carries a
death sentence for anyone found in possession of more than 30 grams
(just over one ounce) of specified hard drugs and 11 pounds of any
narcotic.
   According to Tehran television reports, also monitored in
Nicosia, the public welcomed the crackdown.
   Already, 75 people have been hanged in advance of the new law,
and hundreds of tons of narcotics have been seized.

<HEAD>Ex-Convict Found Guilty of Murdering Prison Guard He Married</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWOOD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury deliberated about 25 minutes
before convicting an ex-convict of murder in the shooting of his
wife, a prison guard he married after he finished serving a term for
armed robbery.
   Ronnie Ray Strong, 30, of Itta Bena was sentenced Tuesday to life
in prison, the mandatory penalty for murder in Mississippi, by
Circuit Judge Howard Q. Davis.
   The sentencing capped a one-day trial in which Leflore County
prosecutor Charlie Swayze described Strong as ``mean as a snake and
dangerous.''
   The defense argued that Strong should be found guilty of the
lesser charge of manslaughter because he was acting in the heat of
passion when he shot Charlene Meeks Strong four times in the neck
with a .22-caliber pistol.
   Strong met his wife in July 1986, while he was an inmate at the
State Penitentiary at Parchman, where she was a guard. He moved in
with her upon his release, and married her in April 1988.
   Willie Perkins, Strong's attorney, told the jury that on the
night of Sept. 10, Strong was drunk and under the influence of
marijuana when he got into an argument with his wife, whom he
believed was having an affair with another man.
   Strong testified that when he asked her where she had been, she
told him it was none of his business.
   He also said that during the argument, which erupted as Mrs.
Strong was sitting in the kitchen doing her hair, she reached into
her bag and ``put on a pair of brass knuckles.''
   Strong pulled out the gun, which he claimed he never intended to
use, and in the ensuing scuffle, the gun went off. Strong said he
couldn't account for the other three shots.

<HEAD>Panasonic Agrees to Repay Consumers in Price-Fixing Scheme</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Panasonic agreed Wednesday to refund up to $16
million to settle charges that the Japanese electronics company
cheated consumers nationwide by fixing prices, the state attorney
general said.
   The scam ``elevated prices by an average of 5 to 10 percent on
many of its products,'' Attorney General Robert Abrams said at a
news conference. ``In a few short months over $15 million was
extorted from consumers in the form of higher prices.''
   The alleged scheme involved 16 products sold under the Panasonic
and Technics labels, including videocassette recorders, videotape
cameras, cordless telephones, answering machines and stereo
equipment, Abrams said.
   In the settlement filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
Panasonic agreed to make refunds to 665,000 consumers nationwide who
purchased Panasonic products between March 1 and Aug. 31, 1988.
   Abrams said the company began the scheme in March, but ended it
after six months when it learned of his investigation. Panasonic had
planned to extend the scheme to eventually include all of its
products, Abrams said.
   Panasonic coerced retailers into charging full list prices for
its products by threatening to stop supplying stores that sold its
equipment below the suggested retail price, he said.
   The attorney general described ``an elaborate nationwide scheme
involving scores of Panasonic sales executives pressuring thousands
of retailers throughout the country to comply with the scheme and
then Panasonic actually monitoring the prices that they charged.''
   Panasonic denied any wrongdoing, but agreed to make the refunds.
   ``We voluntarily resolved the matter in the belief that a quick
settlement would help avoid protracted and costly litigation and
disruption to our dealers and our business,'' said Ralph Wolfe, a
Panasonic vice president.
   Consumers who bought any of the products during the six months of
the alleged scheme and sent in warranty cards will be notified they
are eligible for a refund and mailed the necessary forms.
   The company also agreed to publish newspaper advertisements
telling its customers how to get their refunds, Abrams said.

<HEAD>Marcos Makes Second Offer To Return ``Hidden Wealth''</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Marcos Health</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate president said Wednesday
that ousted President Ferdinand Marcos has offered to return an
undisclosed amount of money stashed in Swiss banks in exchange for
permission to return home.
   Sen. Jovito Salonga said the offer was made in an August letter
and was the second such offer made by Marcos.
   Salonga formerly headed a government body charged with recovering
Marcos' fortune.
   Presidential Executive Secretary Catalino Macaraig confirmed that
a proposal to return $5 billion was made in July but was rejected by
the government, which says Marcos, his family and associates
illegally garnered up to $10 billion during his 20-year presidency.
   President Corazon Aquino said on Wednesday she had received no
formal, unequivocal offers directly from Marcos. She had said she
would let Marcos return only if he returned money obtained illegally
while in office.
   ``It (Marcos' offer) was not very clear. It was coursed through
third parties and there was not anything definite ... Until things
are put down in writing and formally addressed to me, I guess we
cannot really study the matter,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters.
   Marcos, 71, was toppled in the February 1986 ``People's Power''
uprising that swept Mrs. Aquino into power and forced Marcos into
Hawaiian exile.
   ``He (Marcos) signed a document ... offering to transfer to the
Philippine government the disputed funds in the Swiss banks,''
Salonga told reporters. ``No amount was indicated in the letter.''
   Salonga said the letter was signed in the presence of an Allan
Weinstein, an American professor who was to ``act as a
representative (of Marcos) to deal with the Philippine government,''
Salonga said.
   Marcos faces 39 civil cases in the Philippines involving
embezzlement. No criminal charges have been filed against Marcos or
his family. Philippine laws prohibit trial in the absence of the
defendant.
   On Oct. 21, a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Marcos, his wife,
Imelda, and eight other associates on racketeering charges. They
were accused of plundering their homeland of $103 million to buy New
York real estate and defrauding U.S. banks of more than $165 million
between 1972-1986.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded not guilty.
   Marcos' lawyers told a federal judge in New York on Wednesday he
is unable to stand trial there on racketeering charges because he is
dying.
   The Manila government has refused to allow the Marcoses to return
for fear that their civilian and military supporters would undermine
the 35-month old Aquino administration. Mrs. Aquino has faced at
least five coup attempts, mostly from troops loyal to Marcos.

   A broken home, a history of childhood
drinking and a criminal record might have been warnings. But
authorities said Wednesday they may never know why Patrick Purdy
attacked a schoolyard full of children with an assault rifle.
   Purdy, a loner who often worked as a welder in his travels around
the country, apparently lived in a bizarre fantasy world involving
the military and the Middle East.
   When he slipped onto the Cleveland Elementary School grounds
shortly before noon Tuesday, he was wearing a flak jacket and an
olive drab T-shirt with the words ``Death to the Great Satin'' _ not
Satan _ on the back and ``PLO,'' ``Libya'' and ``Earthman'' also
written on it.
   In a room at the El Rancho Motel, where he lived in the weeks
leading up to the massacre, police found about 100 plastic toy
soldiers, a broken .22-caliber rifle and an olive drab cloth bearing
drawings of ``three snarling-type faces'' and the words ``V for
victory'' and ``F for freedom.''
   His weapons bore similar markings, including the word
``Hezbollah,'' the name of a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction in
Lebanon.
   ``What the significance of that is I do not know,'' said Stockton
Police Capt. Dennis Perry on Wednesday. ``He obviously had a
military hangup of some kind.
   ``It suggests that this guy may have had delusions of grandeur
about Iran,'' he said.
   Perry said Purdy was arrested in Los Angeles in 1980 on charges
involving prostitution, in 1982 by Los Angeles County sheriff's
deputies on a marijuana charge, in 1983 in Beverly Hills for
manufacture or sale of an illegal weapon, in 1983 by Los Angeles
deputies for receiving stolen property and in Woodland, about 50
miles north of here, on a robbery charge.
   Perry did not know the disposition of some of those cases, but
said Purdy served jail time in the last two cases.
   Julia Chumbley, Purdy's 63-year-old grandmother, figures Purdy's
motive died with him when he took his own life Tuesday in Stockton,
15 miles south of her home in Lodi in the farming-rich San Joaquin
Valley.
   ``I don't understand why and I probably won't ever know why,''
said Chumbley, a retired cannery worker, in a telephone interview.
   An aunt, Julie Michael of Sandy, Ore., said that despite being
the product of a broken home and having a criminal record and a
history of childhood alcoholism, Purdy did not display hate or other
outward signs of impending disaster.
   ``When he was around here, he acted well,'' Chumbley said.
   Chumbley said her grandson, who also went by the alias Patrick
West, had only a normal interest in guns as a child.
   ``All boys that age like guns,'' she said. ``It's normal for that
age, isn't it?''
   Purdy's father, Patrick Benjamin Purdy, a Lodi cab company
employee, was struck and killed by a car in September 1981. The
death disturbed the younger Purdy, but Chumbley said he seemed to
have recovered from the loss.
   As for why most of the victims were Southeast Asian refugees,
Chumbley said, ``As far as I know, he was not prejudiced. We're not
a prejudiced family. We weren't raised that way.''
   She said his parents were married in Stockton, then divorced
after a short time. His mother remarried and took Purdy to the Lake
Tahoe, Nev., region and then on to the Sacramento area.
   He dropped out of high school and began drifting, living briefly
in several communities, she said. In Stockton, his grandmother
remembers a girlfriend. ``But that was some time ago,'' she added.
   In June, Purdy traveled to Oregon where he worked in Portland as
a welder for a time, lived with an aunt and uncle and bought the
assault rifle, then continued on to Colorado, Texas and finally
Connecticut, Chumbley said.
   ``That's where I sent his Christmas present. I thought he was
still there. I didn't even know he was back,'' she said.

   A Communist Party leader said Wednesday the
way is clear to make the Solidarity trade union legal again. Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski won a vote of confidence after offering to
resign in a bitter internal fight.
   The policy-making Central Committee's vote of confidence kept
Jaruzelski, party leader and head of state, in power on the second
day of a meeting in which the party debated union freedoms, the
official PAP news agency said.
   The meeting led to a party resolution that paves the way for the
relegalization of Solidarity, said chief party ideologist Marian
Orzechowski.
   Jaruzelski and other key members of the ruling Politburo,
including Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Rakowski and Interior Minister
Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, offered to give up their party and government
posts, PAP said.
   In an unusual description of the heated debate, PAP reported
``accusations that party policy was incomprehensible, faulty and
often contradictory of the expectations and view of party members.''
   PAP said the doubts of the 230-member Central Committee were
justified by the ``bad experiences'' of 1980-1981.
   Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent union movement,
was formed during labor unrest in 1980, crushed with martial law in
1981 and outlawed in 1982.
   The 230-member Central Committee gave Jaruzelski and the other
leaders a vote of confidence with only four abstentions.
   It was the first time the government reported such a resignation
offer, suggesting growing official openness.
   PAP said the Central Committee passed a position paper on
political and union freedoms by a vote of 143-32, with 14
abstentions.
   The text was not released, but Orzechowski told state radio it
was a ``great turning point.''
   ``It opens the road to restoration of trade union pluralism,
including Solidarity, formulating at the same time a number of
conditions which have to be fulfilled so the road is not too
bumpy,'' Orzechowski said.
   ``We don't know the reaction of the other side yet,'' he said.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa had insisted on a clear party
statement of its willingness to recognize his union before he would
enter talks with the government on Poland's future.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington that
the Polish leadership's ``stated willingness to relegalize the
Solidarity trade union under certain conditions is a step forward.
... Relegalization would be a major achievement on the road to
Poland's reform and recovery. We would welcome it.''
   Rakowski had asked the Central Committee for a green light to
offer to restore the union's legal status for a two-year trial
period on condition it help the government in its economic and
political reforms.
   Orzechowski said the conditions ``stem from our experiences and
from the foreseen potential effects of the developing events.'' He
urged the opposition to show a ``sense of responsiblity.''
   A draft of the original resolution on trade union freedoms
obtained by Western news agencies said that at proposed talks with
the opposition, ``the organizational forms of expanded national
reconciliation should be determined.''
   ``There should also be agreed conditions, means and a schedule of
introducing trade union pluralism, and opening the road for creation
of new trade unions, including Solidarity.''
   It was not known if the language concerning Solidarity was
altered during the party debate in which many Central Committee
members spoke against Solidarity.
   Solidarity has remained active despite the ban, first as an
underground organization and later increasingly tolerated by
authorities. Recently, Walesa has been treated as a member of the
``constructive opposition'' whose views are carried in the media.
   Officials have said they would like Solidarity's support in
maintaining calm as the government introduces its potentially
disruptive reforms.
   Officials believe an agreement with Solidarity would also help
the government obtain badly needed Western credits.
   On Tuesday, Rakowski urged a conditional offer of legalization to
Solidarity so long as the union agrees to act as a partner, not a
``political opponent.''
   He said Solidarity would have to declare itself a part of
socialism and disassociate itself from anti-communist groups,
observe a strike moratorium and give up financial assistance from
the West, which has amounted to millions of dollars.
   Legalization would come only after the two-year probationary
period when both sides would evaluate ``positive and negative
experiences,'' Rakowski said.
   A Solidarity source in Warsaw said privately that the conditions
set by Rakowski initially appeared ``unacceptable.''
   But Krzysztof Sliwinski, an independent journalist associated
with Solidarity, was more optimistic.
   Emphasizing that he was giving his own view and not the union's,
Sliwinski said, ``It seems to be a commitment to recognize
Solidarity. So I would would consider it an important first step
that was very difficult for them.''
   Sliwinski said the most difficult condition for the union to
accept would be a moratorium on striking, which Rakowski suggested
should last two years.
   ``Walesa has said many times that he does not want to organize
strikes,'' Sliwinski said. ``But without the right to strike there
is no use being a union.''
   True partnership with the government would be impossible under
those conditions ``because all the power is on the other side,'' he
said.

   The new Bush administration may raise quotas
for refugees in light of rising numbers of people wanting to come to
the United States from such places as the Soviet Union and Southeast
Asia, Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III said Wednesday.
   ``We will have to look at the possibility of increasing numbers
and of increasing dollars'' for the refugee program, Baker said at
his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
   In addition, Baker said, the problem of the glut of refugees in
first-asylum countries _ the places they gather after leaving their
homelands to await permanent moves _ ``will occupy our time and
attention'' early in the new administration.
   Baker's comments came as he underwent a second day of friendly
questioning on his nomination to lead the State Department in the
new administration. The full committee was expected to vote to
approve his appointment on Thursday, and the Senate was scheduled to
meet Jan. 25 to act on that and other nominations.
   On other subjects:
   _Responding to questions about two long-pending treaties with the
Soviet Union, Baker said agreement is complete on verification
procedures for the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty and
nearly complete on verification rules for the 1974 Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty.
   The two will be sent together to the Senate for ratification,
Baker said, but he declined to say when.
   _Baker said he had reservations about U.S. participation in a
scheduled 1991 international human rights conference in Moscow, but
he added, ``We made a commitment and we plan to keep it'' so long as
conditions for improvements in Soviet human rights performance are
met.
   _Asked how he interprets changes being made by Soviet Leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, in regard to the Soviet Union's approach to the
rest of the world, Baker said, ``The jury is still out. That's why
... we should approach our relationship with prudence and a certain
degree of realism.''
   _He said he was ``not in a position to prejudge what we would
do'' if Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, applied for a visa to visit the United States.
Secretary of State George Shultz rejected such a request from Arafat
last November, but Arafat has since made statements more to U.S.
officials' liking concerning terrorism and Israel.
   _Answering a question prompted by documents at the heart of the
Iran-Contra affair, he said he believed all of the officials who by
law are members of the National Security Council _ the president,
the vice president and the secretaries of state and defense _ should
be informed of presidential decisions to undertake covert actions
overseas.
   _Baker said he believed that Bush, as a former United Nations
ambassador, would be inclined to include in his budget request not
only full funding for the U.S. share of the world body's operating
costs, but also installments on paying back dues accumulated during
the Reagan administration.
   Baker ``is very skillful, as he should be, and I'm impressed,''
said Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., expressing a view apparently
shared by many panel members.
   ``I think he's going to make an excellent secretary of state and
I'm ready to vote,'' added Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C.
   On the subject of refugees, the State Department said last week
that the quota for Soviet and other East European refugees would be
raised by 7,000 this year and the quota for Vietnamese refugees
would be lowered because many of the Vietnamese are former political
prisoners unable to emigrate.
   Baker said the plight of some Vietnamese was ``a major problem.''
   Closer to home, Baker said he was unaware of reports cited by
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., that the United States, through the CIA or
some other avenue, is covertly financing the campaign of the
Christian Democratic Party in El Salvador's presidential elections
scheduled for March.
   ``I'm not familiar with what you have suggested is taking
place,'' Baker told Helms. He said he generally does not approve of
covert U.S. funding of political campaigns in other countries, but
said that on occasions it could be appropriate to defeat ``parties
or personalities inimical to the United States.''
   On still another subject, responding to a question from Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass., Baker said, ``I think you will see a new approach
toward acid rain from this administration,'' although he did not say
what that approach would be. The Reagan administration often was
criticized, particularly by Canada, for dragging its feet on taking
action to mitigate the problem.

   About 2,500 Republican stalwarts and wealthy
contributors feasted on a $1,500-a-plate dinner and toasted George
Bush's presidency Wednesday night, unmindful of noisy protesters
outside who chanted ``Feed The Poor, Not the Rich'' and ``What About
the Homeless?''
   Two days before their inauguration, the president-elect and his
Vice President-elect, Dan Quayle, toured the lavish dinners at three
sites around the city, including the newly refurbished Union Station
where dozens of street people ate hot chili and rice from a
makeshift soup kitchen on the plaza out in front.
   Inside, the black-tie guests expressed little concern about the
message the demonstraters were shouting.
   ``I feel it's ridiculous,'' said Thomas J. Stewart, a Seattle
business executive. ``They hold these staged events every time
Republicans get together and it's in very poor taste.''
   ``The people here have probably contributed more as individuals
and corporations to the welfare of this country than anybody else,''
said Tulsa, Okla., oilman Jim Hewgley. ``If they want to celebrate,
then, by God, they're entitled to.''
   Several hundred protesters demonstrated for three hours, shouting
at the limousines that pulled up to the main entrance at Union
Station with inaugural dinner guests, but dispersed peaceably as the
dinner began in mid-evening.
   Three hours before the start of the Union Station dinner, several
hundred street people enjoyed a ``counter Inaugural banquet'' of hot
chili and rice, tortilla chips, salad and apple cider on the plaza
in front of Union Station.
   While they ate off of paper plates, the homeless listened to
guitar players and watched a pro-abortion street theater featuring a
man in tennis shoes wearing a Bush mask and a sign reading, ``I
oppose abortion'' hanging around his neck.
   Protesters organized by a group called, ``The Counter-Inaugural
Coalition for a Peoples' Agenda,'' carried placards reading, ``Food,
Not Bombs,'' ``George Knew'' and ``The Skies Are for Stars, Not
War.'' Another sign under a huge peace symbol read, ``Now Appearing
In a Four-Year Show, Son of Reaganstein, co-starring Big Bird.''
   Bush and Quayle were guests of honor at the lavish dinners
attended by more than 2,500 Republican stalwarts and fat-cat
contributors. The black-tie crowd was so large the dinners were held
at Union Station and the nearby Pension Building and Corcoran
Gallery of Art.
   For $1,500 ticket, each invited guest was to hear brief remarks
by Bush and Quayle at the three dinner sites and feast on a
four-course dinner.
   Outside of Union Station, Park Police Sgt. Robert Kass banished a
half dozen conservative Republican counter-demonstrators for lack of
a permit.
   The leader of the group, Eugene Delgaudio, 34, executive director
of the private, ultra-conservative activists group known as ``Public
Advocate,'' said he wanted to show ``there's a better way than
openly, political negativism.'' He said his demonstrators were to
welcome the black-tie dinner guests with American flags and signs
reading, ``Welcome Non-Liberals.''
   Several homeless people paused between spoonfuls of chili to say
that the $2.25 million in proceeds from the inaugural dinners should
be spent to provide food, additional shelters, job training and
subsidized public transportation for Washington's street people.
   Referring to the inaugural diners, Roosevelt Carrington, a
30-year-old homeless person, said, ``I think maybe they should eat
the same thing we're having so they'll know what it's like.''
   Said Ronnie Thompson, 38: ``They done robbed most of it from
us.'' He said the inaugural dinner proceeds should be used for the
homeless because ``a lot of them have given up.''
   More than 1,000 people were served at the counter-inaugural
dinner at Union Station.
   As guests began arriving shortly before 7 p.m., several hundred
of the people at the counter-inaugural banquet began shouting,
``What about the homeless'' and ``50,000 dead from AIDS. Where was
George?''
   Although the Park Police allowed the demonstration to spread
closer to the train depot than the demonstrators' permit allowed,
the protestors remained 100 yards from the entrance where the
invited guests were emerging from their cars and were barely audible
from that distance.
   At about 7:30 p.m., one half hour before the Union Station
banquet would get officially underway, the Park Police received
reinforcement and barricades which were set up in front of the
demonstrators.
   Park Police Sgt. G. F. Wallace, asked whether the barricades had
been planned in advance, said, ``I'm not in on these decisions, but
I imagine it was spontaneous because of the crowd's activity...we
can't have the police spread out or people can sneak through. We
should have had them up there before.''
   There was no indication that any of the invited guests to the
Union Station dinner were even aware of the demonstration. None of
them came over to see what is going on.
   At the majestic Corcoran Gallery of Art, dinner guests who also
paid $1,500 each were serenaded up a royal blue carpeted stairway by
violins playing, ``This Could Be The Start of Something Big.''
   Elegantly attired guests wandered through art displays ranging
from modern neon art to traditional American pieces. The gallery was
hung with blue bunting with white stars and large arrangements of
red roses decorated the corridors.
   Among the guests at the Corcoran gala dinner were Bush's longtime
friend and Commerce secretary-designate, Robert Mosbacher of Texas,
and Mosbacher's socialite wife Georgette. Mrs. Mosbacher, like Mrs.
Bush and Mrs. Quayle was dressed in a black-and-white gown.
   Also among the guests were Sen. John Warner, R-Va., and Bush's
son, Marvin, and his wife, Margaret. The younger Bush said he was
having fun, but mostly waiting for Friday's swearing in of his
father.
   ``The rest will be fun,'' he said, adding, however, ``the one we
will all be looking forward to will be Friday - an incredibly proud
moment for all of us.''
   His wife, who wore a fitted, strapless black gown with a brocade
bodice, said she had never seen George and Barbara Bush so excited
as they have been with the inauguration approaching. ``They're like
two kids,'' she said.

<HEAD>Bush Promises to Reach Out to Americans `Still Hurting'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Bush, beginning an inaugural whirlwind
in solemn remembrance and thunderous celebration, promised Wednesday
a government that will reach out to Americans ``still hurting''
despite the recovery of the Reagan era.
   Addressing an exultant throng gathered at the Lincoln Memorial,
Bush invoked the words chiseled onto its walls when he said
```government of the people, by the people and for the people' ...
is the kind of government I plan to lead'' upon taking the
presidential oath Friday.
   On the first of five days of inaugural activity, Bush also paid
parting tribute to Ronald Reagan, his political mentor, and promised
all the nation's teachers that education ``will be on my desk and on
my mind'' from the moment he becomes president.
   At the majestic monument to Lincoln, as evening fell upon an
unusually warm, clear day, Bush said ``America is strong once again,
we are respected around the world ... our children are being born
into a land of oppoortunity.
   ``But the job is not complete,'' he declared. ``Some are still
hurting. And we care.''
   ``Many important tasks lie ahead,'' Bush said. ``Let us rekindle
the flame of confidence and commitment so that we can accomplish the
great goals we have yet to achieve.''
   With that, he ignited his inaugural flame as well, triggering a
massive fireworks display in keeping with his concept of the
nation's diversity and promise as ``a thousand points of light.''
U.S. Park Police estimated the crowd at 250,000; inaugural
organizers put it at 40,000.
   It was a day bursting with moments of quiet reflection as well as
pomp and promises. Memories were stirred in a private meeting with
old Navy comrades who saved his life in the Pacific 44 years earlier.
   Before the night was out, Bush, his wife Barbara, and Dan and
Marilyn Quayle donned their formal wear and dropped in on three
separate $1,500-per-plate dinners for thousands of Republican high
rollers, noting that their contributions helped finance several
inaugural shows free to the public. At one location, the renovated
Union Station, homeless people lined up outside for a soup-kitchen
meal served by anti-poverty activists while the GOP guests dined on
Maryland crab and roast pork.
   A glowing Bush told the swank assemblage at the Corcoran Gallery
of Art that ``It's just beginning to set in'' that he will be
president on Friday. ``It's so hard to describe,'' he said. At Union
Station, he joked that ``The Bushes and Quayles won't interrupt this
dinner for long. We can't. We're exhausted.''
   The two women wore matching black and white _ Mrs. Bush in a gown
with long-sleeve white top, swirled with rhinestones, and a black
A-line skirt tied with a sash; the wife of the Vice President-elect
in a wrap-style gown with fitted bodice and flowing skirt.
   The outdoor pageant produced the only thunder of a
picture-perfect day _ a flyover by 21 Navy combat jets, the Good
Vibrations of the Beach Boys, the bombs bursting in air, in
electric-white glare.
   Bush was accompanied there, too, by his wife and the Quayles. For
that occasion, the women wore matching, shocking-red coats; Mrs.
Bush topped hers with a huge, Stars-and-Stripes scarf.
   President and Nancy Reagan, meanwhile, officially bade farewell
to hundreds of White House staffers. ``We were all revolutionaries,
and the revolution has been a success,'' Reagan told 350 aides.
   Tears streamed down Nancy Reagan's face as the Marine Band played
``Auld Lang Syne.''
   Bush told a meeting of the Republican National Committee that ``I
don't believe I'd be standing here as president-elect of the United
States if it hadn't been for the way President Reagan treated me as
vice president, and then the way he rolled up his sleeves and went
to work ... helping his vice president be elected.
   ``When I go say farewell to him tomorrow, it won't be too easy,''
he said. `` We're not coming in to correct the ills of the past.
We're coming in to build on a proud record.''
   Bush began the day with an address to America's educators. ``This
is my very first event on the inaugural calendar. ...That's the way
I wanted it,'' he told 230 top-rated public school teachers,
gathered from every state.
   ``I know you've heard me say during this campaign that I intended
to be the education president. Two days before I begin trying I
wanted you to know that I meant it.''
   Bush, who attended the exclusive Phillips Academy at Andover,
Mass., and earned his college degree and Phi Beta Kappa key at Yale,
told the teachers: ``I am awed by your work.''
   ``Education will be on my desk and on my mind right from the
start,'' he said.
   With two days to go before he is sworn in, Bush was all over town.
   First off, he moved from the vice presidential mansion into
lodgings closer to the White House, then set off on a schedule
crammed with social events, including the reunion with his Navy
rescuers more than 44 years ago.
   Bush joked, meanwhile, that he was giving wife Barbara ``a little
elbow room'' while she was still in the throes of moving. ``I don't
care if I see her for another 48 hours, because I know there'll be
another crate that she (will say): `Move this one over here.'
   He paused, and added: ``I'm getting tired of that. After all,
I've got big responsibilities.''
   In private, Bush embraced 16 surviving crew members of the USS
Finback, a World War II submarine which rescued him after he bailed
out when his TBM Avenger torpedo bomber was struck by Japanese fire.
   Bush, who has accorded the Finback veterans the choicest seats at
several inaugural events, welcomed them to his temporary quarters at
the Blair House to renew memories. One, Don Kohler, of Rogers, Ark.,
the torpedoman who pulled Bush from the drink, said ``It was very
emotional. You have to remember that very few of us had seen any of
the others for 44 years.''
   Kohler said Bush told the group that ``his relationships in the
war helped him a great deal in guiding his life.''
   Another recollection, according to retired Rear Adm. Lawrence
Heyworth of Virginia Beach, Va., once the Finback's gunnery officer,
was that the crew nicknamed Bush ``Ellie'' for ``his outstanding
imitation of an elephant trumpeting.''
   That wasn't the stunt of an aspiring Republican. Bush, then 20,
merely had seen too many ``Tarzan'' movies in the wardroom.
   In his remarks to the school teachers, Bush said that even under
budgetary constraints, ``We're going to work to make sure that the
nation does what needs to be done for our schools: reward
excellence, weigh standards, expand choice, publicize success,
strive to resolve shortcomings.''
   Paul Parets, a band teacher at Alexis I. DuPont High School in
Wilmington, Del., said, ``I was very moved. I sat there thinking he
could have met with the heads of foreign states, he could have met
with the leaders of the military or the captains of industry and
instead he chose to meet with 230 teachers from across the United
States.''

   Two Virginia Military Institute cadets on
Christmas vacation robbed an armored car of $4.5 million in a plan
conceived by one cadet's father, authorities said Wednesday in
announcing their arrests.
   The father, Robert J. Jasinski, 51, of Boonton was a part-time
driver for the Coin Depot Armored Car Corp. of Elizabeth when one of
its trucks was robbed Dec. 22 in Clifton by two men dressed as
police officers.
   The two ``policemen'' were William T. Jasinski, 22, and Bryan
Smals, 21, of Columbus, Ohio, cadets at the Lexington, Va., miltary
school, said John McGinley, head of the FBI's Newark agency.
   The elder Jasinski met the hijacked armored car in a rented van,
to which the money was transferred; the police uniforms were rented
from a costume store in Paramus, McGinley said at a news conference.
   A ``majority'' of the money was recovered from an attic crawl
space at the home of a woman acquaintance of the elder Jasinski,
McGinley said. The woman, whom he did not identify, did not know
what Jasinski was storing and did not participate in the crime,
McGinley said.
   The money, displayed with a 9mm automatic, was in a dozen plastic
garbage bags and a footlocker.
   McGinley said the cadets were arrested at their campus Wednesday.
Robert Jasinski, a retired telephone company worker, was arrested at
his home and held on $400,000 bail.
   The lawyer who represented the elder Jasinski, Edward Hartnett,
declined to comment on the charges.
   All three were charged with interference with commerce by threats
or violence, which carries a 20-year prison term upon conviction.
   William Jasinski, a senior, and Smals, a sophomore, were friends
on vacation from the military school when the crime was committed,
said McGinley.
   The complaint said Robert J. Jasinski was interviewed by an FBI
agent on Tuesday and at first denied the allegation. He later
admitted planning the robbery and implicated the cadets, the
complaint said.
   In Roanoke, Va., Wednesday night, U.S. Magistrate Glen Conrad
ordered the younger Jasinski and Smals held without bond pending
their transfer to Newark.
   FBI agent Frank Butler said Jasinski and Smals confessed to the
heist when they were questioned at VMI following their arrests, and
both cadets also admitted their guilt at the bond hearing.
   ``The complaint is correct, sir,'' Jasinski told Conrad at the
hearing.
   McGinley said an investigation of employees after the robbery was
``instrumental'' in cracking the case. He said Jasinski drove the
same route as the robbed truck.
   Authorities said the two robbers held up three employees of Coin
Depot as they parked an armored car behind the First Fidelity Bank.
The car was to bring the cash to the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York.
   They handcuffed the employees and drove them to a nearby
industrial park, freeing the three unharmed.
   The FBI said the robbers wore police-type clothing, including
three-quarter length blue nylon coats with fur collars, blue police
caps and police badges.

   Children whose families escaped the
horrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard turned into a
killing field, the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and
a pistol bearing the word ``victory.''
   After the massacre at recess, the bodies of three Southeast Asian
children were outlined in blue on the playground of Cleveland
Elementary School where they died. Two others had been dragged by
teachers inside to a classroom, but also died. Twenty-nine other
pupils were wounded, along with a teacher.
   ``There was shooting all over. ... I was scared,'' said
sixth-grader Binh Hoang, who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in the
final days of war and had never before heard gunfire. ``Everybody
was crying in my class.''
   Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26,
armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle, entered the
school grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 rounds
before he shot himself to death.

   Despite warnings from other Justice Department
officials, former Attorney General Edwin Meese III remained blind to
ethical problems raised by his actions on behalf of lobbyist E.
Robert Wallach, the Justice Department says.
   The report, issued Tuesday, concludes that Meese violated federal
ethics standards. An attachment to the report shows more than 600
contacts between Meese and the San Francisco lawyer from the time
the Reagan administration came to power.
   Meese's assistance to scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. in 1981 and
1983 and his efforts on behalf of a proposed Mideast oil pipeline in
1985 were three instances in which his friendship with Wallach
``dictated'' federal actions, said the report by the department's
Office of Professional Responsibility.
   Wallach, who collected $1.3 million from Wedtech from 1982 to
1986, is awaiting trial in New York on racketeering and other
charges. He is accused of peddling his connection to Meese.

   Serial killer Ted Bundy's death warrant
for murdering a girl was signed minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court
rejected his appeal, and the mayor of the slain child's town said
the execution would prompt celebrations.
   In signing the warrant, Gov. Bob Martinez set the execution for
Jan. 24 for the 1978 rape and murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Diane
Leach, who was abducted in Lake City and was found dead in a pig sty.
   It was the fourth time the 42-year-old former law student has
been scheduled to die in Florida's electric chair. Bundy, whose case
was depicted in the television miniseries ``The Deliberate
Stranger,'' has come within hours of being executed only to win
postponement.
   His attorneys said after Tuesday's 7-2 high court decision they
would pursue further appeals.
   Bundy also has also been sentenced to death for killing two women
in a Florida State University sorority house in Tallahassee three
weeks before Kimberly's murder. He has been linked to up to 36 sex
murders or disappearances of young women, most in Utah, Colorado and
Washington state.

   Volcanoes killed more people in the '80s
than during the previous 78 years, yet the deadly peaks are
inadequately monitored to protect 350 million people who live near
their slopes, a geologist says.
   ``We have to do a better job of studying the volcanoes of the
world,'' said Robert Tilling, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist who
coordinated the agency's response to the Mount St. Helens eruption.
   ``Existing methods of monitoring volcanoes are proving relatively
reliable. We just don't do enough of it.''
   Since A.D. 1000 more than 300,000 people died from volcanic flows
_ lava, pyroclastic or mud _ tsunamis and post-eruption starvation,
Tilling said in a summary of his remarks for today's annual meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Mudflows from Colombia's Nevado del Ruiz killed at least 22,000
people in 1985, while more than 2,000 perished in pyroclastic flows
_ blasts of hot gas, rock and ash _ from Mexico's El Chichon in
1982, Tilling said. Mount St. Helens left 57 people dead or missing
in 1980.

   Multimillionaire Robert Hearin has paid $1
million in ransom and spent six anguish-filled months awaiting word
on his kidnapped wife, and neighbors say it might be time to accept
she'll never return.
   ``For fear of sounding callous, I don't want to say that. But yet
I think as time goes by, people are becoming increasingly despondent
about the chances'' of solving 73-year-old Annie Laurie Hearin's
disappearance, Julia Yandell said Tuesday.
   Yandall and others in Jackson's posh Woodland Hills neighborhood
have been on edge since July 26, when Mrs. Hearin was abducted from
her home.
   FBI agents also aren't as optimistic as they were a few months
ago.
   ``We're pursuing leads. New things develop all the time, but
nothing at this time looks real promising,'' said FBI agent Stewart
Murphy.

   Students from 20 Roman Catholic, Protestant,

<HEAD>Americans, Earth And Peace Themes Of Inaugural Worship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Caring _ for the people of America, for God's creation and for
reconciliation of the nations of the Earth _ is the credo of a
special worship service marking the inauguration of George Bush as
president.
   A litany for it, expected to echo in many churches across the
country at his suggestion, goes in part:
   ``O God of all goodness and grace ... grant us ... a teachable
and humble spirit ... a heart that mourns with those who suffer ...
faith that the world shall not be inherited by the violent ... but
by those whom gentleness makes great.''
   At Bush's wishes, the worship is to crown weekend inaugural
events this Sunday at the National Cathedral, the Episcopal center
in Washington and the denomination of Bush and his family.
   ``He wants the inaugural to culminate not with fireworks but with
prayer,'' his wife, Barbara, told planners.
   Bush, his family and an ecumnical turnout of religious leaders,
Protestant, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish, are taking
part in the service, including Episcopal Presiding Bishop Edmund L.
Browning of New York.
   ``Clap your hands, all people!'' say the Psalms for the affair.
``Shout to God with loud songs of joy! For the Lord, the Most High,
is ... a great king over all the earth ... Sing praises to God, sing
praises.''
   Copies of the liturgy have been sent to pastors of all kinds
across the country, and Bush has written them an open letter,
suggesting they hold similar Sunday morning services, afterward
ringing church bells.
   The hourlong service unfolds in three topical sections of concern
_ for Americans, for stewardship of the created earth and for world
peace and friendship _ each section with Scripture readings,
litanies and sermons.
   In the Washington service, Susan Baker, wife of Secretary of
State-designate James A. Baker III, leads the litany of concern for
America's people, which reads in part:
   ``Behold, O Father, our land, our America. Bless her always with
sound strength and sure purpose,'' with ``vision and courage to
nourish and preserve her as a haven of freedom and justice and
peace.''
   The Rev. Peter Gomes, a Harvard University minister and a black
American Baptist, gives the sermon on that theme after Greek
Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos of New York reads accompnaying Scripture
from James 2, which goes in part:
   ``Listen, my beloved brethren ...`you shall love your neighbor as
yourself'... If a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily
food, and one of you says to them, `Go in peace, be warmed and
filled,' without giving them the things they need for the body, what
does it profit?
   ``So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.''
   Bush's son, George Walker Bush, leads the litany on preserving
the created order, saying in part:
   ``Behold, O Lord, your creation, `this fragile Earth, our island
home' ... teach us to know and to respect the delicate balance of
your creation, so that our ignorance can be overcome ... thereby
restraining our expoitation and abuse of natural resources.''
   Missouri's Gov. John Ashcroft, a layman of the Assemblies of God,
preaches on the conservation theme, following Scripture readings
about the creation from Genesis 1, including this conclusion:
   ``And God saw that it was good.''
   That reading is by the Rev. Stephen E. Smallman of McLean
Presbytrerian Church in Washington which is attended by Vice
Preident Dan Quale and his family.
   Browning, the Episcopal primate, preaches on the theme of
reconciliation of the Earth's people after a Scripture reading from
the beatitudes of Jesus in Matthew 5, including:
   ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of
God.''
   Washington's Episcopal Bishop John T. Walker presides at the
service, punctuated with hymn singing and music from the U. S.
Marine Band, the Cathedral Choir and Howard University Choir.
   After the opening processional and singing, Rabbi Matthew H.
Simon of B`Nai Israel congregation in Rockville, Md., reads an
initial Scripture passage from Deuteronomy 10, going in part:
   ``For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the
great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who is not partial... He
executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the
sojourner, giving him food and clothing.''
   Washington's Roman Catholic Cardinal James Hickey reads from 1st
Corinthians 12, going in part:
   ``Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and
there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; and there are
varieties of working, but it is the same God who inspires them all
in every one.''

   Those who only know David Morrell's work
through the Sylvester Stallone ``Rambo'' movies based on his books
probably don't grasp the subtle subtexts.
   But most of his 13 books, including the best-seller ``Brotherhood
of the Rose,'' now an NBC miniseries, revolve around father-son
relationships.
   ``Brotherhood of the Rose,'' a four-hour, two-part miniseries, is
scheduled to air Sunday after the Super Bowl and conclude Monday. It
stars David Morse and Peter Strauss as orphans trained by their
adoptive father (Robert Mitchum) to be assassins. But the father
eventually betrays them.
   The original ``Rambo'' was based on Morrell's 1972 book, ``First
Blood,'' about a Vietnam veteran who turns against the society that
slights him. Even Rambo is a surrogate son. His former commander,
Col. Trautman, played by Richard Crenna in the movies, is the father
figure.
   Though he is known for writing in the action-adventure genre,
Morrell has written a book called ``Fireflies'' about the death last
year of his 15-year-old son, Matthew.
   ``I've had more response from that book than anything else I've
written,'' he said. ``I've heard from people with pain. It's about a
child who died and my grief. I was in a state of crisis. I was
trying to make sense out of the irrational.
   ``Fathers and sons have been a major theme of my work. My father
was a flier in World War II and was shot down over France. I never
knew him. I grew up with a strong sense of something missing. I
write about male bonding between an older man and a younger man. I
grew up without a father, and now I must live the rest of my life
without a son.''
   Morrell's said the germ of ``Brotherhood of the Rose,'' was a
casual remark by an intelligence source who told him the primary
recruiting ground for assassins is orphanages.
   ``I got very interested when I heard that,'' said Morrell. ``I
said, `What an idea for a book!'''
   The father figure in ``Brotherhood of the Rose,'' he said,
``doesn't perceive of himself as a villain. He's with the government
but sort of operates in a world of his own. The crux of the story is
that these two young men were programmed as assassins.
   ``But what happens is that at a certain point they discovered he
didn't love them, that he had been using them. It turns into a chase
as the two students stalk the old pro. It's the sons against the
father. It's almost like a Greek tragedy.''
   ``Brotherhood of the Rose,'' directed by Marvin J. Chomsky, was
filmed in New Zealand. That island country, with its varied scenery,
stands in for Thailand, Panama, the United States, France and
England.
   Morrell said he is pleased with the results ``because it gets in
the action as well as the characterizations.'' He said he has no
complaint about the ``Rambo'' movies, but does wish the
characterizations weren't usually sacrificed in favor of the action.
   Morrell was a professor at the University of Iowa for 16 years
until he resigned in 1986 to devote all his time to writing. ``I had
full tenure as a professor, but I said I'd done that,'' he said. He
decided to remain in Iowa City.
   He said he is lucky ``people buy what I write. I can live
anywhere I want.''
   Morrell said his research in preparation for writing included
attendance at the National Outdoor Leadership School in Lander,
Wyo., and the G. Gordon Liddy Academy of Corporate Security and
Private Investigation.
   The outdoor school taught him about survival in the wilderness.
In the final three days of the course he and his classmates had to
reach a certain point on the map. But to get there they had to climb
a mountain range in winter with no food. He lost 30 pounds in three
days.
   The other course, taught by former Watergate conspirator Liddy,
trained him in corporate security and investigation. The school no
longer exists.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush promised ``new faces'' to
help lead his administration but the consummate government insider
has turned to people cozy with the ways of Washington to fill his
Cabinet.
   Even the two women he picked _ Carla Hills as the U.S. trade
negotiator and Elizabeth H. Dole as labor secretary _ are long-time
fixtures on the capital's power circuit.
   In fact, only three people in the new Cabinet had not held
earlier full-time jobs either in Congress or the administration.
They are Dr. Louis Sullivan, the head of health and human services;
Robert A. Mosbacher at commerce, and Samuel K. Skinner at
transportation.
   ``I never pledged that I would have a totally inexperienced
Cabinet,'' Bush said. ``I want an experienced Cabinet. That's
exactly what we've got.''
   Three men are hold-over appointments from the Reagan
administration: Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Nicholas F. Brady
as treasury secretary and Lauro F. Cavazos as education secretary.
   By law and custom, the Cabinet has 14 fixed members. Also sitting
in Bush's Cabinet will be Mrs. Hills and Richard Darman, director of
the Office of Management and Budget. Congress stipulated that the
new drug czar, William Bennett, has Cabinet-level status.
   Here are sketches of the incoming Cabinet members:

   Admirers call James Addison Baker III, the new secretary of
state, the ``ultimate pragmatist.'' At least one skeptic has called
him ``Mr. Shmooze.''
   The accolade suggests an open and adaptable approach; the
criticism, a tendency toward private self-promotion.
   At the outset, Baker's strength lies in strong ties to Bush. His
views will be heard. He can operate free of anxiety that White House
officials are scheming to undercut him.
   His main weakness is lack of experience in foreign affairs.
   Baker, 58, managed Bush's unsuccessful 1980 presidential drive
and his victorious campaign last year.
   Baker and Bush have been close for nearly two decades. They share
a wealthy country-club Texas background. Both are Ivy League
graduates _ Bush went to Yale and Baker to Princeton.
   At State, the main issues confronting Baker are whether to keep
U.S.-Soviet relations on a conciliatory course and what to do about
the 40-year Arab-Israeli dispute and the problems in Central America.
   His background as treasury secretary will help him cope with
rising debt problems in Latin America. His political skills are
bound to maintain the smooth relations with Congress and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization allies that George P. Shultz, his
predecessor, cultivated.
   Whatever comes up, Baker should have no trouble getting an
appointment with the president or at least reaching him by telephone.

   Nicholas Brady, who as the treasury secretary will be the Bush
administration's chief economic spokesman, has a family pedigree and
Ivy League education similar to that of his long-time friend, George
Bush.
   Brady took over the Treasury job last September after James Baker
resigned to run Bush's presidential campaign.
   He has kept a low profile so far, in part because there have been
no economic crises which demanded immediate attention. Once Bush
takes office, Brady is expected to play a key role in some of the
biggest problems facing the new administration: how to trim the
budget deficit, how to resolve the savings and loan crisis and what
to do about the $1.3 trillion in debt being carried by Third World
countries.
   Brady, 58, entered Yale one year after Bush graduated. After
earning a masters degree in business at Harvard, Brady joined the
New York investment banking firm of Dillon, Read &amp; Co. in 1954,
where he spent his entire career.
   Brady served briefly as a U.S. senator from New Jersey in 1982,
appointed to the seat after the Abscam conviction of Democrat
Harrison Williams Jr.
   He did not seek election to the post but remained active
politically as a trouble-shooter for the Reagan administration,
serving on four different advisory commissions on the MX missile,
Central America, foreign aid and the October 1987 stock market crash.

<NOTE>HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Retired pro-football quarterback Jack F. Kemp, a self-described
``bleeding heart conservative'' with an interest in housing and
homeless, has vowed to be a team player when he takes over as
secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
   During nine terms as a congressman from Buffalo, N.Y., Kemp
gained a reputation for his outspoken views on economic policy and
his staunch anti-communism.
   But many people have high expectations that Kemp will put the
spotlight back on the housing agency, which has been virtually
hidden from public view for eight years under Samuel Pierce.
   One program that Kemp hopes will breathe economic life into the
nation's inner cities is urban enterprise zones, which would give
tax incentives to businesses that operate in and employ residents
from distressed areas.
   Kemp, 53, graduated from Occidental College in 1957 with a degree
in physical education. He was drafted by the Detroit Lions but left
the team to join the Los Angeles Chargers in 1960. He was later
traded to the Buffalo Bills, winning the American Football League's
most valuable player award in 1965.
   Kemp was elected in 1970 to his congressional seat in a suburban,
blue-collar area. He left the seat to make an unsuccessful bid for
the GOP presidential nomination.

   After two decades in Congress, Manuel Lujan Jr. yearned to return
to New Mexico but Bush persuaded him to stay on as the new secretary
of the interior.
   Lujan, 60, was described by Bush as a man who wants to find ``a
careful balance'' between protecting the environment and developing
the nation's resources.
   Lujan, one of two Hispanics in the Bush Cabinet, is often
described as a pragmatist willing to listen to a broad range of
viewpoints. Environmentalists maintain, however, his record is
distinctly pro-business.
   In Congress, Lujan co-sponsored a bill that would allow oil
development on the arctic coastal plain and voted to cut federal
subsidies for water projects, limit the liability of utilities in
nuclear accidents, and delay implemention of rules protecting
endangered sea turtles.
   Lujan was born to a prominent New Mexico family. His father was
mayor of Santa Fe and ran unsuccessfully for governor and Congress.
After working briefly in the family's insurance business, Lujan was
elected to Congress in l968.
   He won re-election with 71 percent of the vote in 1986, a year in
which he also had triple bypass heart surgery. He has insisted that
his health is fine and did not affect his decision in early 1988
against seeking another House term.

   Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the only black in Bush's Cabinet, brings
to HHS a long-time desire to improve health care for the poor.
Sullivan has focused his efforts as president of the Morehouse
School of Medicine in Atlanta on training doctors, especially
minorities, who are willing to establish family practices in rural
and inner-city areas.
   The 55-year-old doctor is a personal friend of Bush and his wife,
Barbara, who was named to the medical school's board of trustees in
1983.
   Sullivan's selection was nearly derailed after he was quoted in
an Atlanta newspaper as saying he supported a woman's right to seek
an abortion, though he opposed federal funding for the procedure.
   His statement inflamed anti-abortion groups and he later said he
opposed abortion in all cases except in cases of rape, incest and
when the mother's life is in danger, mirroring Bush's view.
   Since the abortion flap, Sullivan has said little about his
priorities for HHS, the largest of all the federal departments. HHS
includes Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security as well as the
Public Health Service and the Food and Drug Administration.
   Sullivan graduated with honors both from Morehouse College in
1954 and Boston University Medical School in 1958. He has taught
medicine at Harvard, Morehouse, the New Jersey College of Medicine
and Boston University.
   In the 1970s, Sullivan worked to establish the Morehouse medical
school and when it separated from Morehouse College in 1981, he
became president. It is one of the three predominantly black medical
schools in the country.

   The top issue on James D. Watkins' agenda as energy
secretary-designate _ repairing and cleaning up the nation's nuclear
defense plants _ is one for which his military background gives him
special preparation.
   Watkins, 61, studied nuclear reactor engineering in 1958 at the
Oak Ridge, Tenn., National Laboratory. He taught at naval nuclear
training centers in 1960, and four years later took command of the
nuclear-power attack submarine Snook.
   The Oak Ridge lab is one link in the Energy Department's
nationwide network of nuclear weapons plants. The system has been
crippled recently by safety and technical problems that forced the
shutdown of the only reactors that make tritium, a radioactive gas
vital to the production of nuclear warheads.
   Watkins capped a 41-year Navy career with a four-year stint as
chief of naval operations, the service's top job. He retired in 1986.
   In October 1987, Watkins took over as chairman of the
presidential commission on AIDS that recommended legislation to
prohibit discrimination against victims of the deadly disease.
   Watkins graduated from the Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md., in
1949, earned a master's degree at the Naval postgraduate school and
then decided to specialize in nuclear submarines.
   Watkins was a protege of the late Adm. Hyman Rickover, the father
of the modern nuclear Navy. He became commander of the Pacific
Fleet, based in Honolulu, and in March 1982 was named chief of naval
operations by President Reagan.

   Early in William J. Bennett's tenure as secretary of education,
the National Education Association asked him what he would do if he
had a magic wand to wave over American schools.
   ``No drugs _ none, zero, out, gone, disappear,'' replied the
blunt-spoken educator.
   As Bush's choice to be the nation's first drug czar, it will fall
to Bennett to find a way to win the war on drugs.
   Bennett, 45, was a headline-grabbing education secretary who
railed against rising college costs and slipshod standards. He also
spoke out on topics from defense of Western civilization courses to
AIDS.
   He left Reagan's Cabinet in September to write, open a small
policy shop called the Madison Center, and deliver lectures at
reported fees of up to $15,000-per-appearance.
   Bennett obtained a Ph.D in philosophy from the University of
Texas at Austin and a law degree from Harvard. He taught at several
campuses and eventually ran the National Humanities Center in

   Carla Hills won swift praise when she was named as the nation's
top trade negotiator. But there also was grumbling.
   ``I had hoped that we'd have someone from the business world who
had extensive international experience,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, said after the 54-year-old Washington lawyer was named U.S.
trade representative.
   But Hills' fans say she is fully up to whatever comes her way.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., calls her ``a tough negotiator'' and
Clayton Yeutter, the outgoing trade representative, praised her
``strong international background.''
   Hills has been underestimated before.
   Her 1975 nomination by President Ford as secretary of housing and
urban development quickly came under fire.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., groused that experience is too
seldom valued in the nation's capital, chortling that the Washington
Redskins had once lost 16 yards on a play devised by Richard M.
Nixon.
   ``I can promise you that I won't be sending in any football
plays,'' Hills shot back. She went on to win wide plaudits in the
post.
   She graduated with honors from Stanford, where she captained the
tennis team, and was 20th in her class of 167 at Yale Law School.
She served as an assistant attorney general for a year in the Ford
administration and has practiced law in Los Angeles, where she

   Texas oilman Robert A. Mosbacher Sr. takes over the Commerce
Department without any government experience but pledging to keep
communication between Washington and the business community ``open
and continuing and even building.''
   Bush turned to a longtime friend and stalwart GOP fund-raiser in
selecting Mosbacher to round out his economic team, saying the
61-year-old businessman would ``bring his tremendous energies to the
task of promoting U.S. exports abroad.''
   Mosbacher has raised money for the president-elect in every
campaign since Bush ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1970.
   Mosbacher, whose fortune in oil, real estate and ranching is
estimated at more than $200 million, founded Mosbacher Energy Co.
and is an avid sailor in his off-hours.
   He amassed his fortune after leaving his home in White Plains,
N.Y., in 1948 at age 21 to make his way in Texas. He first met Bush,
who also ventured out from New England to Texas as a young man, in
the late 1950s.
   Mosbacher's primary responsibilities at Commerce will include
work on opening foreign markets to U.S. goods, administering the new
U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and presiding over the 1990
national census.
   Mosbacher received a bachelor's degree in economics from
Washington and Lee University in 1947.

William Bennett.
   ``We're all on the side of the angels,'' Cavazos said last Sept.

   The first Hispanic to serve in the Cabinet is a Democrat who in

   A soft-spoken political novice, he has generally kept a low

   Cavazos has vowed to fight for ``the best funding possible'' and
has pledged to focus federal services on high-risk children. His

   The biggest change Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has noticed
at the Justice Department since he ran the criminal division 11
years ago is the agency's increased international focus.
   The attorney general says one of his top priorities is to
streamline and centralize international operations that focus on the
rise of international drug trafficking, money laundering and
terrorism.
   Thornburgh's successful prosecutions of organized crime, public
corruption and drug trafficking while U.S. attorney for western
Pennsylvania led to his 1975 appointment by President Ford as
assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division.
   In 1978, Thornburgh was elected to the first of two four-year
terms as Pennsylvania governor. His calm handling of the Three Mile
Island nuclear power plant crisis just weeks after he took office in
1979 won him widespread acclaim.
   The 56-year-old attorney general was a member of his party's
liberal wing early in his political career, opposing the Vietnam War
and supporting New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller for president in
1968.
   But like fellow Yale graduate George Bush, Thornburgh has moved
slowly to the right of the political center.
   Thornburgh was appointed by President Reagan last summer to
restore the Justice Department's image and moral after the lengthy

   John Goodwin Tower is a former U.S. senator and political insider
who for years has coveted the job he's about to take on for George
Bush _ secretary of defense.
   The 63-year-old Tower, a diminutive man in stature but described
by friends as ``willing to play hardball anytime,'' is a Texas
native who fought as an enlisted sailor during World War II and then
went on to become a defense expert in the U.S. Senate.
   At the time he retired in 1985 after 24 years on Capitol Hill, he
was the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and had
helped Ronald Reagan push his military buildup through Congress. He
earlier had made a name for himself as an expert on the details of
weapon systems and defense policy and as a conservative critic of
the Soviet Union.
   Tower wanted to head the Pentagon under Reagan, but lost out
first to Caspar W. Weinberger and then in 1987, to Frank C. Carlucci.
   After retiring from the Senate, Tower became a high-priced
Washington consultant _ with major defense contractors on his client
list _ but interrupted that life to serve as an arms control
negotiator for Reagan and then as the head of the presidential panel
that investigated the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Known as a pragmatist who prefers backroom negotiating to public
posturing, Tower has been unable to avoid the glare of publicity in
his private life. Twice divorced, he has been the subject of rumors
about womanizing raised by his second wife during divorce
proceedings and about excessive drinking.
   Tower has dismissed such assertions as ``rumors and innuendos.''
   Set to become the nation's 17th secretary of defense, Tower has
said he is convinced defense spending can be reined in and a strong
military still maintained. He has denied his previous work in the
Senate and with defense contractors will prevent him from canceling

   Skinner, 50, has also been U.S. attorney in Illinois and has long

Illinois in both 1980 and last year.
   He built a reputation for toughness as top deputy to Thompson
when the governor was U.S. attorney and created the office's Special

   Elizabeth Hanford ``Liddy'' Dole, President-elect Bush's choice

bipartisan popularity in the nation's capital.
   Mrs. Dole, 52, was a Democrat when she came to Washington two
decades ago, but switched to an independent and then Republican as
she climbed the ladder of success, holding several jobs in the Nixon
and Ford administrations and becoming an active campaigner in the
presidential campaigns of her husband, Senate Republican leader Bob
Dole of Kansas.
   President Reagan chose her as transportation secretary in 1983.
She served for four years and left with her popularity intact
despite criticism that during her tenure air and highway safety
suffered.
   Organized labor had a few disputes with Mrs. Dole while she was
at transportation, but labor leaders have voiced approval of her
selection, if only for the fact that they believe her political
ambitions will lead her to seek a higher profile than those who were
passed over for the job.
   At the Labor Department, she will be involved in Bush's promised
plan to expand day care availability and likely will serve as the
administration's chief spokeswoman when Congress debates raising the
minumum wage and in a legal fight over the government's plan to drop
a ban on home work in the apparel industry.

   During his 11 years in Washington, William H. Webster has been
called upon to cleanse the reputations of two tarnished but vital
federal agencies, first the FBI and since 1987, the CIA.
   After Bush won the election last November, critics of Webster
pressed for his ouster as director of Central Intelligence.
   But Bush, who was cast out as CIA director by newly elected
President Carter in 1977, announced on Dec. 7 that he had ``total
confidence in Webster'' and that his tenure at the spy agency was
``open-ended.''
   Webster, 64, was appointed CIA director in the wake of
revelations that the late William Casey had subverted agency
operations to run his own ``off-the-shelf'' intelligence network,
consisting in large part of CIA operatives but working outside the
oversight of Congress.
   Webster, who was born in St. Louis and trained as an attorney,
still prefers the title ``judge,'' which he earned on the Eight
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   He was summoned to Washington in 1978 by President Carter to take
over the FBI. At the time, the FBI was still tainted from the
48-year directorship of J. Edgar Hoover, who threatened politicians
with secret files and ordered domestic spying against those with
whom he disagreed.
   When Webster left the agency nine years later, he had largely
restored the image of the bureau and moved it into new areas of
investigation, such as white collar crime and drug trafficking.

   Brent Scowcroft, the new national security adviser, is a seasoned
White House hand who has differed sharply with President Reagan on
such key strategic issues as ``Star Wars.''
   George Bush has asked for a review of strategic policy. Although
neither he nor Scowcroft have spelled out the new U.S. strategy, it
could differ from Reagan's in important respects.
   Scowcroft, appointed by Reagan to head a blue-ribbon panel that
studied plans for a mobile intercontinental ballistic missile,
recommended development of the single-warhead Midgetman missile,
which would be based on trucks on military reservations in the
Southwest.
   However, the Pentagon budget that Reagan sent to Congress on Jan.
9 dropped all money for the Midgetman in favor of the 10-warhead MX
missile, which would be based on rail cars.
   Scowcroft also has urged that Reagan's ``Star Wars'' program to
develop an anti-ballistic missile system be traded away in arms
talks with Moscow.
   And he criticized the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force treaty
that Reagan signed with the Soviets in December 1987. Scowcroft said
the pact helped denuclearize Europe, a step considered beneficial to
the Kremlin because of its advantage in non-nuclear forces.
   Scowcroft, 63, was born to a Mormon family in Ogden, Utah,
graduated from West Point in 1947, and rose in the Air Force to the
rank of lieutenant general.
   Scowcroft began a five-year stint at the White House as military
aide to President Nixon in 1972-73, and was deputy to national
security adviser Henry A. Kissinger in 1973-75. Scowcroft served as
national security adviser in 1975-77 after Nixon resigned in 1974,
Gerald Ford was president and Kissinger became secretary of state.
   He was one of three members of a commission that investigated the
Iran-Contra affair in 1987.

<HEAD>Quayle Sees Bush as Model for Vice Presidency</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

   Imitation may be the sincerest form of vice
presidency _ and Dan Quayle is modeling his performance on the way
George Bush handled the job.
   That bodes well for his job appraisals by the boss.
   ``He knows what it takes to be an effective vice president,'' the
incoming No. 2 man said of Bush. ``He was one.''
   The vice president-elect said much of his work will be
low-visibility, one-on-one advice and assistance to the president.
Quayle said he won't be speaking up in forums like Cabinet meetings
but, rather, will offer his ideas in even more private settings.
   He is to meet daily with the president during the new
administration. There are to be private luncheons each Thursday,
like those Reagan held with Bush. The president-elect said he will
treat Quayle as he was treated during eight years as vice president.
``His vice presidency will be like mine,'' Bush said.
   Quayle said in an interview with The Associated Press that Bush
already has consulted him on Cabinet appointments, has sought his
advice on a variety of issues. He won't describe the subjects, let
alone the advice.
   ``That's one of the reasons I'll be an effective vice
president,'' he said. ``I'm just not going to take these things
public.'' Bush stuck with that rule even when mocked for it during
the campaign.
   Vice presidents do not get starring roles. They are understudies.
That assignment poses a special problem for Quayle. After a campaign
of controversy and sometimes ridicule, he has an image to repair.
He's said he intends to make life more difficult for the late-night
television comics who have been thriving on Quayle jokes.
   The vice presidency itself often has been a joking matter. In the
musical comedy ``Of Thee I Sing,'' Alexander Throttlebottom got the
job by losing a drawing and had to join a tour group to get into the
White House. Vice President Alben Barkley told of the two boys who
vanished _ one went to sea and the other became vice president.
   So Quayle has a tall order to fill. A second-term Indiana senator
who vaulted to the Republican ticket at age 41, with no national
credentials, he has to demonstrate his ability and his leadership
qualifications, all in a supporting role with a relatively low
profile.
   ``The high visibility, the high profile is by the president, not
the vice president,'' Quayle said. ``But the American people will
judge me on how I perform.'' He said there will be public
assignments, tasks that will put his abilities out front so that the
people can determine what kind of job he's doing.
   The most telling judgment will come from one man, the 41st
president of the United States. ``... I will be a broad-ranging
adviser to the president,'' Quayle said, working on ``the model that
was established by George Bush.''
   He said much of what Bush did for Reagan was known only to them.
He said he intends to work the same way, and to judge his
performance by its usefulness to the president.
   ``If he continues to have confidence in you, to rely on you for
things of importance, then you are an effective vice president,''
Quayle said.
   He said his specific assignments will evolve as events dictate,
and will include foreign and domestic travel, political missions,
work with Congress and more.
   Bush said in an earlier AP interview that a lack of specific and
immediate vice presidential assignments won't be a problem. ``Ronald
Reagan didn't give me anything to do,'' he said. ``It just evolved.''
   Bush said the same pattern will apply in his relationship with
his own vice president. ``And then I'll say to him some day, `Dan,
I've got a real problem here and I want you to handle it. And you're
the guy to do it because you've got a standing beyond any of these
Cabinet members.' ''
   Bush said he'd reminded Quayle a while back that he'd had his own
image problems not long before. ``I said, `Dan, take an eraser and
erase Quayle from these stories, take an eraser to the date and set
the date back a year, and then where you're taken out Quayle put in
Bush and you'll be pretty close...
   ``So things turn around.''

   Clayton Yeutter, Bush's designated new agriculture secretary,
moves to his new job after serving 3{ years as the U.S. trade
representative where he was the nation's No. 1 negotiator on
agricultural and other international trade issues.
   He is widely respected for his aggressive push to make foreign
markets more open to U.S. products and for his ability to soften
harsh protectionist legislation in Congress.
   Yeutter, who grew up on a farm in Nebraska and still manages
2,500 acres of property near the town of Cozad, served in the Nixon
and Ford administrations as an assistant secretary of agriculture,
running some of the regulatory programs.
   President Reagan considered Yeutter, 58, for the position of
agriculture secretary in 1980, but he was passed over because of
objections from some members of Congress. He was later named trade
representative.
   Yeutter, a man who runs on very little sleep and always appears
affable, will oversee the fight with the European Economic Community
over U.S. demands that subsidies be eliminated.

   Edward J. Derwinski will be the first head of the Department of
Veterans Affairs, which Congress has upgraded to the level of a
Cabinet job.
   A Chicago native, Derwinski served in the Army in the Pacific
during World War II. He was a member of Congress from 1959 until
1983. Although he did not serve on any veterans committees,
Derwinski, 62, brings to his new job vast experience on Capitol Hill.
   After leaving Congress, Derwinski garnered foreign policy
experience, serving first as the counselor of the State Department
and a special adviser to the secretary of state. He later became
undersecretary of state for security assistance, science the
technology, a post he assumed in April 1987.
   Derwinski is known for his trademark crew cut and loud
sportscoats and for his puckish humor.

   Richard Darman, the wealthy son of an industrialist with
undergraduate and graduate degrees from Harvard, has spent much of
his career in the bureaurcratic trenches. From 1970 until 1977, he
served in the Nixon and Ford administrations in policy positions in
the departments of defense, justice, commerce, state and health,
education and welfare.
   Darman, 45, entered the Reagan administration in 1981 as a top
aide to James A. Baker III, who was then the White House chief of
staff and is now Bush's choice for secretary of state. He followed
Baker to the Treasury Department when Baker moved there in 1985.
   At treasury, Darman was a key figure in developing a plan to
drive the value of the dollar lower as a way of reining in the huge
budget deficits.
   Known for his keen intellect and his political skills, Darman
resigned the No. 2 job at treasury in 1987 to take a position with
Shearson, Lehman Bros. investment banking division.
   Last summer, he joined the Bush campaign, serving as a stand-in
for Michael Dukakis during Bush's practice debates.

<HEAD>Civilian Authority in Guatemala Still Subject to Military Consent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This tiny country of 8.5 million people _
more than half of them Indians who speak two dozen Mayan dialects _
has never sustained a modern democratic government. Today, three
years after it elected a civilian as president, it still is trying
to shake off its past.
   Civilian authority, it is widely agreed, is conditioned on
military consent and supervision.
   ``I assumed the presidency to begin a new attempt to establish
constitutional democracy in our country,'' President Vinicio Cerezo
told Congress on Jan. 14, the anniversary of his inauguration.
   ``We can say we have achieved some of our goals. We are in better
shape than before.''
   ``Guatemala is living through a transition government,'' the
defense minister, Gen. Hector Gramajo, said in an interview. ``We
will have a new Guatemala by the year 2000.''
   Under the generals of the early 1980s, Guatemala was an
international pariah. In an effort to wipe out a stubborn leftist
insurgency, human rights groups said, the armed forces and
military-linked death squads killed tens of thousands of suspected
government opponents _ accusations the armed forces deny.
   Would-be organizers of left-leaning labor unions were slain. The
press was tightly muzzled. Above-ground political activity by any
organization to the left of center was nil. The economy was stagnant.
   The United States, then under President Jimmy Carter, cut off
U.S. aid. Non-military aid resumed under the Reagan administration,
but a decision to let Guatemala buy almost $14 million worth of M-16
rifles last year drew fire from congressional critics in Washington.
   Today, the U.S. State Department calls Guatemala an ``emerging
democracy,'' a classification that remains controversial.
   Expression is much freer nowadays, though still subject to some
unwritten restraints. A leftist-led labor federation has grown
impressively. Politicians who describe themselves as socialists
speak out and survive.
   Thousands of Indians driven into the hills or across the northern
border into Mexico by harsh military campaigns are beginning to
return. The insurgency sputters along, but at a much lower level;
the 1,500 or so guerrilla fighters hold no territory.
   Economic growth in 1988 was a robust 3.5 percent, with officials
predicting even greater expansion this year.
   But the progress was made under a watchful military eye that
limits the authority of Cerezo, the legislature and the judiciary.
   A coup attempt May 11, reportedly sponsored by extreme rightist
businessmen and landowners, was put down without bloodshed when
Defense Minister Gramajo backed the government.
   ``The military is disposed to stop being part of the problem,''
Gramajo said in the interview. ``It rather will be part of the
solution. Military power is exercised in military matters, and in
the broader sense, we serve the function of stabilizers.''
   Still, the attempted rebellion made clear the degree to which
Cerezo's continued occupation of the presidential palace depended on
military consent.
   Diplomats and other observers said he was obliged to agree to
several rebel demands backed by even those officers opposed to a
coup.
   Among them were a halt to tentative efforts to separate police
forces from military command.
   ``May 11 put an end to any illusion of real power he might have
thought he had,'' said the Rev. Andres Giron, a Roman Catholic
priest and peasant organizer. Giron, a longtime friend of Cerezo's,
said he probably will ask for a dispensation from the Vatican to run
for president in 1990.
   ``Here you can be the government, but you can't govern, because
you've got thousands of guns pointed at your back,'' said a
provincial mayor and member of Cerezo's Christian Democratic Party,
commenting only on condition of anonymity.
   Land reform is one area of concern.
   Peasant organizations estimate 70 percent of the country's arable
land is owned by 1 percent of the population. Other groups dispute
that figure, but acknowledge that land distribution is greatly
skewed in favor of a tiny upper class.
   Members of the diplomatic corps said Cerezo would not be allowed
to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union or Cuba,
although foreign relations generally are an executive branch
prerogative in Western democracies.
   ``This government doesn't have the characteristics of what you
would call a democracy,'' said a government official involved in
investigation of human rights abuses.
   Most diplomats agree that Cerezo has proven adept at walking a
fine line, that he is a pragmatic master of compromise. With the
right divided and the left emerging from decades of repression, the
centrist Christian Democrats appear in good shape to retain the
presidency when Cerezo, who cannot succeed himself, leaves office
office in 1991.
   Cerezo appears intent on ingratiationg himself with the military
until then.
   When 22 peasants were massacred last November in Chimaltenango
province, he immediately accepted the military version of events
that put blame on leftist guerrillas.
   He did so despite what his own government's human rights
attorney, Gonzalo Menendez, described as a lack of evidence
implicating any particular individuals or organizations.
   On New Years' Day, 83 people drowned when a crowded ferry
capsized while being towed by a navy patrol vessel.
   Survivors, including a tugboat captain, said a recklessly
executed tow was the disasters' principal cause, but Cerezo, for
whom defense of the military has become a reflex, praised the navy's
rescue efforts.
   ``If the navy had not been there, the tragedy would have been
worse,'' he said before leaving Jan. 3 for a 10-day trip to the
United States.
   His office described the trip as a ``personal vacation,'' and he
stayed on vacation even as argument swirled over whether Central
American presidents should hold a summit conference Jan. 15-16.
   Foreign Minister Alfonso Cabrera, looking for a success to
bolster his prospective presidential campaign, pushed the summit,
designed to restart the Central American peace process and finally
end guerrilla wars in the region.
   Cabrera was unsuccessful and the summit was postponed; Cerezo
made no public statement and took no visible part in the debate,
which was over before he returned to Guatemala.

<TEXT>
   It was 15 months ago when seven American
Linen Supply Co. workers walked off the job, a strike that the
plant's other 35 union members didn't honor.
   The strikers, all women, were replaced on the strike's first day
and they have long since been cut from unemployment compensation
rolls.
   They haven't given up. Their stubborness has become a saga in
this northern Minnesota town and a nationwide symbol of
labor-management confrontation in an era when job security has
become a prevailing issue.
   ``We eat, drink, and sleep the strike,'' said Betty Judnitsch,
48. ``You just can't help it.''
   Tom Pender, president of the Iron Range Labor Assembly, said the
women's persistence has astonished observers.
   ``It was amazing that they were standing out there last winter
when it was 30 below,'' Pender said. ``Well, here it is this winter
and they're still there.''
   Known as the Hibbing 7, they take turns picketing outside the
green and white plant where they used to wash, mend and press linen
for $5.42 an hour.
   They walked off the job Oct. 2, 1987, after 11 of 17 members of
United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1116 voted to strike
rather than accept management's final contract offer. They had been
working without a contract for 11 months.
   Linda Carpenter, 43, said the four other workers who voted to
strike immediately capitulated when it became apparent they faced
dismissal.
   The strikers objected to a contract provision that eliminated
company contributions to the union pension fund, Carpenter said.
Instead, the company offered to put money into individual retirement
accounts for workers, she said.
   The women also said they believe Ed Pajunen, company president,
was out to destroy the union. They cite a letter found by strikers
in the company's trash.
   The letter, from lawyer William Harding of Lincoln, Neb.,
previewed a meeting at which district executives would be briefed on
``negotiations in the Omaha and Hibbing district which led to
non-union status at various locations.''
   Pajunen said the letter does not reflect an anti-union bias. He
says the plant has operated more smoothly without a union, but adds
he did not intend to break it.
   ``I'm not anti-labor, but they do a lot of intimidating,''
Pajunen said of unions. ``Some of the things they stand for aren't
necessarily always right.''
   Pender said the strikers would have lost interest if it weren't
for favorable rulings by the National Labor Relations Board's
regional office in Minneapolis and a federal administrative law
judge in Washington.
   Judge Robert Leiner in September upheld allegations of wrongdoing
made by the NRLB's regional office. He ordered American Linen to
reinstate the seven workers with back pay and full seniority rights.
A company appeal is pending.
   By firing Carpenter, Judnitsch, Mary Suzick, 61, Ruth Johnson,
52, Roberta Hecimovich, 46; Marge Richards, 51, and Linda Perry, 33,
American Linen unlawfully discriminated against employees engaged in
a lawful union activity, Leiner wrote.
   The judge also said American Linen must recognize Local 1116 as
bargaining agent for the Hibbing workers. A petition to decertify
the union signed by a majority of plant workers four days after the
strike began should be dismissed because the company illegally
helped prepare and file it, the judge ruled.
   ``We've won. We're right,'' Judnitsch said. ``If we didn't feel
that we were right we wouldn't be out there.''
   Pajunen said he never fired the strikers.
   ``They walked off their jobs,'' he said. ``At this point not one
has asked to come back.''
   The company president said he would consider rehiring the
strikers if any of the 70 positions open. Meanwhile, he said, he
would fight any ruling from the NLRB that is ``untrue.''
   William Watters, an attorney for Local 1116, said appeals could
prolong the fight another year or two. He said the women are willing
to battle until they win, bolstered by strong financial support from
the union.
   ``Fortunately it's not too many situations that end up like
this,'' Watters said.
   Ruth Johnson said she and her husband have been limited to her
weekly $40 strike benefits and his monthly wage of about $700 since
the strike began.
   ``You go from burning fuel oil to burning wood,'' said Ms.
Johnson, who has been living without any health insurance coverage
since losing her job. ``You just cut corners. Sometimes it's just
enough heat to keep the pipes from freezing.''
   Pajunen said the strikers are ``misguided.''
   ``There's probably one or two people in that group who get their
kicks from doing something like this and the other people got
trapped,'' he said.
   Not all the strikers knew each other before the walkout and now
they frequently socialize after handling picket duty.
   ``I think we have our down days,'' Judnitsch said. ``But we're
pretty hearty. We're determined.''
   The inevitable lows have been offset by a few highs, Suzick said.
For instance, Crystal Lee Sutton, whose successful union struggle
against a southern textile manufacturer was depicted in the movie
``Norma Rae,'' appeared at a June 25th rally on their behalf. The
Rev. Jesse Jackson invited them on stage during a campaign
appearance.
   In addition, the strikers say they've scored partial success in
promoting a regional boycott of American Linen's service. A local
school district, for example, has stopped taking the service,
Judnitsch said.
   Pajunen said the boycott has not reduced business.
   ``We have a plant full of happy employees producing for our
customers,'' he said. ``We're not hurting.''

   Business inventories rose 0.4 percent in
November and sales rose at the same pace, the government said in a
report that analysts said bodes well for the nation's economy in the
new year.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday inventories held on shelves
and backlots rose to a seasonally adjusted $753.6 billion in
November, while sales reached $503.8 billion.
   The matching 0.4 percent gains kept the ratio of inventories to
sales at 1.50, meaning it would take 1.5 months to exhaust

barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 7 cents a barrel on
the day.
   The last time the contract for the nearby month settled higher
was Nov. 5, 1987 when the price at the end of the trading day
reached $18.98 a barrel. At that time, there were concerns that the
Iran-Iraq war could seriously disrupt shipments of crude from the
Persian Gulf.
   The price of the near-month contract for West Texas Intermediate
now stands sharply higher than last autumn. On Oct. 5, the nearby
contract sank to an intraday low of $12.28 a barrel.
   Analysts say the markets lately have derived support from a
series of factors deemed promising for the price outlook,
particularly speculation that OPEC nations would be able to curb
their crude oil production.
   Jim Fiedler, a vice president at E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., said market operators are not necessarily confident
that an output accord will come out of a meeting beginning Jan. 26
in London between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries and non-OPEC countries.
   But, they do not expect the meeting to produce any negative news
for the oil markets either, he said.
   The nearby West Texas Intermediate contract reached a high of
$19.21 during the session before traders began to sell to collect
profits amassed during the recent advance.
   Gasoline contracts in the more distant months benefited from
buying partly based on thinking that new environmental
specifications due to take effect this year could restrict
availability in the future. Buying in gasoline spilled over into the
crude oil contracts, brokers said.
   The February contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.19 cent to
settle at 51.10 cents a gallon.
   Among other refined products traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the February contract for No. 2 heating oil slipped 0.11
cent to 53.05 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Gulf &amp; Western Unit Tentatively Agrees to Buy Stake in TV Company</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gulf &amp; Western Inc., the entertainment,
publishing and financial services giant, plans to buy a stake in a
company that owns television stations in several major markets.
   Gulf &amp; Western said Tuesday its Paramount Pictures Corp. had
agreed in principle to a deal that would give it an option to buy a
majority interest in TVX Broadcast Group Inc., which owns nine
independent television stations.
   It would buy the stake from an affiliate of Salomon Brothers
Inc., the securities firm that helped TVX finance its purchase of
five television stations in April 1987.
   No price was disclosed for the latest deal, and it is subject to
reaching a definitive agreement as well as regulatory approval.
   But analysts said it apparently would give Gulf &amp; Western a
relatively inexpensive entry into broadcast television.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Gulf &amp; Western fell
62{ cents a share to $41. TVX jumped $1.62{ a share to $3.87{ in
national over-the-counter trading.
   Paramount currently produces and distributes television
programming. Its parent has said it wanted to become involved in TV
station ownership but that high prices discouraged it.
   Gulf &amp; Western would join a growing list of companies involved in
TV programming that have bought television stations.
   Such companies feel that by getting involved in ``the retail end
of distribution,'' they can exert more control over where and when
their programs are aired, said Raymond Katz, media analyst for the
securities firm Mabon Nugent &amp; Co.
   Gulf &amp; Western said Paramount had agreed in principle to acquire
the right to buy Salomon's majority investment in TVX Broadcast,
which is based in Virginia Beach, Va.
   Salomon wound up with preferred and common stock representing a
79 percent equity interest in TVX following the television company's
recent recapitalization.
   As the first step in the deal, Salomon would put all of its TVX
common stock and enough of its TVX preferred in a new joint venture
that would represent about 51 percent of TVX's voting common shares.
   Paramount would buy a 49 percent interest in the joint venture,
and get an option to buy Salomon's stake in the venture and the rest
of Salomon's TVX preferred stock.
   The statement did not say how much Paramount would pay for its
initial stake in the venture, but one source familiar with the deal
and speaking on condition that he not be identified said it was
about $10 million.
   The source said the total cost to Paramount, should it acquire
all of Salomon's stake, would be between $125 million and $180
million, depending on the company's future performance.
   Salomon became involved with TVX Broadcast when it provided
temporary financing for the concern to acquire five television
stations in April 1987.
   Before TVX Broadcast could line up permanent financing, the stock
market crashed in October 1987 and drove up potential costs of
borrowing.
   As part of a recapitalization plan approved last November by TVX
Broadcast shareholders, TVX Broadcast issued preferred and common
stock to Salomon.
   TVX owns nine independent television stations but agreed as part
of the recapitalization plan to sell four of them _ WTVZ in Norfolk,
Va.; KRRT in San Antonio, Texas; WNOL in New Orleans; and WMKW in
Memphis.
   That will leave the company with five stations _ WTXF in
Philadelphia, WDCA in Washington, D.C.; KTXH in Houston; KTXA in
Dallas and WLFL in Raleigh-Durham, N.C.
   TVX Broadcast lost $21.8 million on revenue of $138 million in
the nine months ended Sept. 30, 1988, compared with a loss of $30
million on revenue of $101.7 million during the same period in 1987.

<HEAD>Icahn Raises Stake In Texaco; Readies For Proxy Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Carl C. Icahn has accused Texaco Inc.
management of deceiving shareholders by formulating a new
anti-takeover defense after promising that an existing strategy
would be allowed to expire.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday,
Icahn also disclosed that he has raised his stake in the oil giant
to 16.6 percent, and that he is considering another proxy challenge
for control of the company.
   ``You know full well that a changed (`poison) pill' would have a
chilling effect on my ability _ or anyone else's _ ability to make
an offer to Texaco shareholders,'' Icahn said in a letter to Texaco
President James W. Kinnear.
   Icahn said a new effort by management to block bids for the
company would in effect deprive shareholders ot ``what could be a
premium of billions of dollars for their shares.''
   Last June, Icahn lost a bitter struggle against management for
control of Texaco's board. Prior to that, Texaco's board had
rejected Icahn's friendly $60-a-share offer to buy the company.
   Tuesday's SEC filing came in response to an article in the Wall
Street Journal. The newspaper reported Texaco was preparing to
replace its expiring poison-pill takeover defense with a new plan.
   Texaco had assured shareholders during its proxy battle against
Icahn that it would eliminate the poison pill, which is aimed at
making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. Analysts have
said that promise was largely responsible for Texaco's victory in
the proxy fight.
   Texaco then promised the committee representing its shareholders
in the company's then-ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
that it would not issue another poison pill without the approval of
shareholders or authorization from an investment banking firm
designated by the committee.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday,
Texaco stock rose 50 cents to close at $53.50 a share.
   The newspaper also reported that the shareholders committee had
designated the investment banker Rothschild Inc. to issue a new
defense and that Kinnear and Texaco Chairman Alfred C. DeCrane had
visited Rothschild's offices about a successor to the poison pill.
   Dennis O'Dea, counsel for the equity committee, denied the panel
had made any such designation.
   Kinnear issued a statement late Tuesday saying, ``This is another
case of Carl Icahn protesting without knowing what is being proposed
and making claims solely for his own benefit.''
   Kinnear said Texaco is considering an interim plan to take effect
when the existing pill expires in April. That plan would be in
effect until shareholders have the opportunity to vote on it at
Texaco's annual meeting in May.
   Texaco officials said the plan would not preclude any legitimate
offers for the company but ``would avoid anyone's acquiring control
of Texaco through creeping purchases, to the detriment of other
Texaco shareholders.''
   Icahn, Texaco's biggest shareholder, said in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission that he boosted his stake in
Texaco to 16.6 percent from 16.2 percent.
   Icahn declined to specify his intentions or to say whether a
second proxy fight was likely. However, in the SEC filing Icahn said
he and other investors were considering forming a slate of nominees
to the four Texaco board seats up for election at the annual meeting.
   Whether he launches a proxy battle depends on the ``nature of
Texaco's recent restructuring,'' Icahn said.
   Texaco emerged from bankruptcy last April and is undergoing a
major restructuring to raise $5 billion in cash, mainly through
asset sales. Texaco promised to distribute $1.7 billion in proceeds
to shareholders probably through a stock buyback early this year.
   In his letter to Kinnear, Icahn alluded to the possibility of
making another fight for Texaco if the company fails to
``sufficiently benefit shareholders in a restructuring that takes
into account the higher proceeds now expected to be received from
the sale of Texaco Canada.''
   Texaco's sale of its 78 percent stake in the profitable Canadian
subsidiary is one of the final steps in the restructuring it
undertook to emerge from Chapter 11.
   Company observers were divided over Icahn's latest gestures.
   Jack Aydin, an analyst with McDonald &amp; Co., said Icahn deserves
better treatment because he is largely responsible for the rise in
Texaco stock from $45 a year ago.
   Other analysts said they were skeptical about Icahn's intentions
since Icahn could benefit handsomely if he decides to sell his
shares back to Texaco. ``It is in his best interests to pressure
Texaco so they could offer him the sweetest deal possible,'' said
Paul S. Kuklinski, an analyst with Cowen &amp; Co.
   ``He has the opportunity to get out of his stock if Texaco
chooses to accommodate him in some fashion and he is reminding them
that might be in their best interest to do so,'' he said.

<HEAD>Luby's Tries Hand At Drive-Through Foods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turn in your trays and neatly wrapped
silverware. Forget about having to wait in long lines as others
decide on their choice of salads or desserts and then having to
balance heavy trays as you look for a seat.
   Luby's Cafeterias Inc., known for its assortment of salads,
mounds of meats and delightful desserts, is giving customers another
choice: eat inside or use a new, drive-through service at its
newest, biggest cafeteria.
   ``We think we have a market and we want to capitalize on it,''
said Vernon ``Bud'' Schrader, vice president of marketing for the
San Antonio-based cafeteria chain.
   ``Obviously the fast-food people have developed the take-home
food market, but the foods are essentially limited to Mexican food,
hamburgers, fried chicken and pizza,'' he said.
   ``I think we have what we can attest can be a success because a
lot of people like our menu and a better-balanced meal, and we just
know that as the market continues to develop more and more people
will be taking us home with them to sit and watch TV or something on
their VCR,'' Schrader said.
   The new drive-through cafeteria will open on Feb. 13 just north
of downtown San Antonio. It will have about 16,000 square feet of
space, including the area that will accommodate the ``To Go'' and
``Park and Order'' areas. Most Luby's have about 10,500 square feet
of space.
   The drive-through service is not quite like ordering a Big Mac, a
Whopper or a two-piece chicken dinner.
   Those wishing to place ``To Go'' orders at Luby's can either call
in and then walk through a separate entrance to the cafeteria to
pick up their order.
   Or, they can either call in or go to six parking spaces that will
have laminated menus and intercoms to place the order.
   After placing the order, the cafeteria workers will prepare the
order and tell the customer to drive to the window and pick up the
order.
   The kinks will have to be worked out after the first few days,
but Schrader believes cafeteria customers will not have to wait much
longer than they would at other fast-food places.
   ``This is just an expansion of giving the customer another
convenience,'' he said.
   Joe Doyle, an analyst who follows Luby's for Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. in New York, said convenience is great, but it's not all
the customer is looking for.
   ``I think the time has probably come for people in the cafeteria
business to try this,'' he said.
   ``It probably has been a logistical challenge because of the
diversity of the menu. I'd be interested in looking on how they
package their food,'' he said.
   ``Obviously, it has to be convenient and easy to handle, but you
don't want your potatoes and gravy spilling into your corn,'' Doyle
said.
   Schrader said Luby's will use different packages, depending on
which items the customer orders.
   ``When we can, we combine food, but if there is any possibility
of spillage, the food is individualized,'' he said. ``We have some
three-compartment plates, but in some cases when you can't put
spinach in there, then it will be individualized.''
   Luby's, founded in 1947 by two restaurateurs, now has 118
cafeterias in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona and Arkansas. In
its last fiscal year ending in August, it posted sales of $254
million.
   For years, Luby's customers were able to take home food from the
cafeteria, but Luby's never marketed its ``To Go'' business until
late 1987.
   In September of that year at its cafeteria near the Texas Medical
Center in Houston, Luby's put up a separate ``To Go'' entrance in
the cafeteria to test customers' desires.
   Last January, Luby's kicked off its ``To Go'' marketing program
with printed menus and on-premises promotions.
   The drive-through cafeteria is a test project for Luby's, and
Schrader said he doesn't know if it will be expanded to other
cafeterias.
   The separate ``To Go'' entrances may be expanded to include other
stores, Schrader said.
   He believes, however, that other cafeteria chains like Furr's and
Wyatt's will begin drive-throughs soon.
   Officials from those cafeteria companies did not return telephone
calls to The Associated Press.
   ``Our competitors will follow us and some are in the process of
doing it right now,'' Schrader said. ``This is just an expanding
market and all good businesses have to capitalize on it.
   ``This requires more labor, no question about it, but all of this
is return on our investment and we feel good about it,'' Schrader
said.
   Bon Appetit.

<HEAD>American Airlines Said To Mull Aircraft Orders Worth $7.4 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines is expected to
announce two aircraft orders for 160 McDonnell Douglas airplanes
worth a total $7.4 billion, according to a published report.
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported in Tuesday's editions that
the deal would have to be approved by the board of directors of AMR
Corp., American's parent. The board's monthly meeting is scheduled
for today.
   But American spokesman Al Becker described the report as ``highly
speculative.''
   The newspaper said the airline, owner of the largest commercial
jet fleet in the non-communist world, will order 60 long-range
McDonnell Douglas MD-11s for an estimated $5.4 billion and 100
domestic-range MD-80s for an estimated $2 billion more.
   American decided to buy the MD-11, which has yet to make its
first flight, instead of the Boeing 747-400, the newest, largest and
longest-range of Boeing Commercial Airplane Co.'s line of jumbo
jets, the newspaper quoted Wall Street and industry sources as
saying.
   The Star-Telegram said the deals will be announced within the
next three weeks, as soon as final language of the contract is
worked out.
   Becker, asked to comment on the report, said: ``We have not
signed any agreements nor have we made any deals with either of the
aircraft manufacturers and we have no announcements imminent.''
   ``The article is highly speculative,'' Becker said when reached
by The Associated Press at American's headquarters in Fort Worth.
   But Becker noted that American has been evaluating both the MD-11
and the Boeing 747-400 as part of its preparation for expansion in
the Pacific and European air markets.
   The airline has 465 jets in its fleet. Aeroflot, the Soviet
Union's state-owned carrier, has the world's largest fleet. American
also has an additional 213 planes either on order or option.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. head offices in St. Louis, Mo., referred
the AP's calls about the possible MD-11 and MD-80 purchases to Don
Hanson, the company's spokesman in Los Angeles. A secretary in
Hanson's office said he was not immediately available Tuesday.
   To McDonnell Douglas, the nation's No. 2 commercial jetliner
maker, American's acquisition would represent an isolated win in its
competition against the larger, wealthier Boeing. It would virtually
assure more sales, said Paul Turk, a spokesman for Avmark Inc., a
Washington, D.C., firm that consults with airlines on aircraft
acquisitions.
   McDonnell Douglas, as 1988 ended, had orders, options and other
commitments for as many as 250 MD-11s. But until Delta Air Lines
announced in September its order for 40, McDonnell Douglas had down
payments in hand for only 40.
   Turk said one reward for being a so-called launch customer for a
new type of aircraft is a discount as high as 30 percent off the
plane's list price.
   ``The MD-11 has been sold for $100 million to $110 million in
ones and twos,'' Turk said. ``We're estimating that Delta is paying
right at about $90 million per plane for its batch. And American,
with its reputation for getting the best price anyone can get,
probably will be paying about $90 million per copy, too,'' he told
the Star-Telegram.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stocks Hit Record High Again, Dollar Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index hit another
record high today, while the U.S. dollar gained against the Japanese
yen for the third consecutive day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell 70.86
points on Tuesday, climbed 127.03 points, or 0.41 percent, in
today's trading, closing at 31,354.55. The previous record of
31,298.38 was set last Friday.
   Although early trading was directionless, news reports about the
possibility of a redenomination of the yen boosted buying orders,
dealers said.
   Such a change could mean, for example, that 100 yen now would
become one yen, requiring a reprinting of Japanese money.
   ``Participants were targeting their buying orders to
redenomination-related issues such as paper, pulp and ink,'' said an
analyst at Nomura Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The buying interest helped boost volume on the first section to
an estimated 1.2 billion shares.
   The news reports quoted Shintaro Abe, general secretary of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, as saying Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita was considering a redenomination of the yen.
   Other dealers said the majority of institutional investors stayed
on the sidelines to await the announcement of monthly U.S. trade
figures, expected later today in Washington.
   On the currency market, the dollar closed at 127.90 yen, up 0.20
yen from Tuesday's 127.70-yen close. The currency also opened today
at 127.70 yen and ranged between 127.63 yen and 128.00 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 1.78 yen in three days.
   Trading was thin ahead of the U.S. trade figure announcement, a
dealer at Mitsubishi Bank said.
   The market was expecting a U.S. trade deficit of $11 billion,
said the dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``If the deficit increases, it won't be a strong dollar-selling
force because nobody expected the figure to improve dramatically in
the first place,'' he added.

<HEAD>Geldermann Elected CME Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John T. Geldermann was elected to a one-year term
as chairman of the board of governors of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, defeating Lawrence Rosenberg, another longtime board
member.
   Both men served terms as chairmen of the Mercantile Exchange, the
nation's second-largest futures market, during the 1970s.
   Geldermann was one of five officials elected Tuesday by the
exchange's 12 board members, who were themselves elected last week.
The exchange did not reveal the vote totals.
   Geldermann, 63, has been a member of the exchange since 1961 and
has served in numerous roles on the board and exchange committees.
   He succeeds John F. Sandner, who was appointed to the newly
created post of senior policy adviser for a 1-year term. Sandner has
completed three years as chairman, the maximum allowed under the
exchange's rules.
   The board also reappointed Leo Melamed as chairman of the
executive committee and special counsel to the board of governors.
   Melamed was instrumental in the development of financial futures
products in 1972.
   Rosenberg will remain the board's legislative liaison for the
coming year.
   Geldermann co-founded, along with his father, Godfrey J.
Geldermann, the Chicago-based trading firm that is now Geldermann
Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConAgra, an Omaha, Neb.,-based
conglomerate with interests in food, fertilizer and clothing.
   Geldermann was seen as a candidate who would maintain the status
quo at the exchange while Rosenberg was said to be a reformer who
would try to open up the exchange management beyond a small group of
executives who dominate it.
   As chairman, Geldermann may oversee the implementation of the
revolutionary Globex electronic trading network, a joint project of
the Mercantile Exchange and London-based Reuters Holdings PLC that
is awaiting regulatory approval.
   ``Our membership is committed to excellence and innovation,''
Geldermann said in a statement. ``My task as the new chairman will
be to work with the CME leadership team and the board of governors
to ensure that this steady progress continues.''
   The board also elected Steven E. Wollack, first vice chairman;
James E. Oliff, second vice chairman; M. Scott Gordon, secretary;
and Larry B. Leonard, treasurer.
   At the Chicago Board of Trade, incumbent chairman Karsten
Mahlmann was unopposed in winning a third consecutive term Tuesday.
Incumbent vice chairman Patrick H. Arbor was returned to his
position after turning back a challenge by Dale Lorenzen.
   Lorenzen, a veteran grain trader, was unexpectedly slated over
Arbor by the exchange nominating committee, but Arbor quickly
obtained the necessary 40 signatures to run on petition against the
nominee.

<HEAD>Editor, AMA, Reject Reynolds Complaints about Smokeless Cigs Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   According to its editor, there is no truth to
contentions that the Journal of the American Medical Association is
being used in a campaign against the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.'s new
``smokeless'' cigarette.
   Reynolds contends the Jan. 6 issue of the weekly publication
contained incorrect information about its new cigarette, Premier,
which heats rather than burns tobacco.
   At issue Tuesday was a letter to the editor of JAMA that reported
preliminary results from scientists at the National Institute of
Drug Abuse in Baltimore, saying Premier could be altered for use in
smoking the potent ``crack'' form of cocaine.
   G. Robert Di Marco, a Reynolds vice president, blasted the report
as a ``backdoor'' effort to discredit Reynolds' product with
``sensational headlines.''
   The journal's editor, Dr. George D. Lundberg, said the letter was
published after peer review, because editors believed it to be
``scientifically sound, in the public interest, and timely.''
   ``I find it odd and surprising that the R.J. Reynolds spokesmen
would choose to vent their obvious frustration in such a pointless
way,'' Lundberg said.
   ``The Journal of the American Medical Association has
traditionally been editorially independent and remains so at this
time,'' Lundberg said.
   Di Marco, however, accused JAMA of ``promoting distortions to
further the political goals of its parent organization.''
   The AMA contends Premier is a ``new, hazardous'' drug that should
be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but its
petitions to state courts for removal of Premier from test markets
in Arizona and Missouri have been unsuccessful.
   Premier contains a metal cylinder with a charcoal tip that is lit
by the smoker, who then draws heated air over tobacco products.
   The Baltimore researchers said the capsule could be removed from
the device and its contents emptied out and replaced with crack. The
altered Premier then was smoked by a machine in tests that indicated
the drug's effects would be felt, they said.
   It would be ``impossible for a human being to smoke the cigarette
in the manner described,'' Reynolds responded.
   ``It's outrageous that government scientists are using taxpayers'
money to try to devise and report new ways for drug abusers to
administer illicit substances,'' Di Marco added.
   The researchers, though, noted Reynolds' own patent application
said the device ``may be used or modified for use as a drug delivery
vehicle, for delivery of volatile pharmaceuticals'' such as those
used in inhalers.
   ``When you patent an invention you patent every single
application that product might have,'' Reynolds spokeswoman Betsy
Annese said later Tuesday.
   ``We have not heard yet of the AMA calling for the removal of
spoons from the marketplace,'' nor for removal of crack pipes or
apples, which she said also can be used for illicit drug use.
   ``Our question is, `Why are they picking on this product?'''
   Ms. Annese said she did not think Premier in its marketed form
could be used for taking prescribed or illicit drugs.
   Di Marco was not taking calls Tuesday.
   Dr. Roy Schwarz of the AMA, who announced in November the
association was moving to block test sales of Premier, also rejected
Reynolds' contention that JAMA was being used in the fight to ban
Premier.
   ``We don't have to manipulate it _ we know what the outcome will
be (of research on the product),'' Schwarz said.
   ``We're opposed to tobacco ... Of course we're opposed to
Premier,'' he said. ``We're the first ones to say there's no quarter
on this one.''
   Reynolds says Premier has the tar and nicotine levels of a
``lights'' brand and virtually eliminates sidestream smoke and
tobacco aroma.
   ``This leads any unsuspecting person to conclude it must be
safer,'' Schwarz said. ``In point of fact, there's no evidence that
it's safer.''

   Share prices rose strongly at midday Wednesday,
pushed up by bullish sentiment as the market surpassed last June's
post-crash high.
   Late morning news that the British government's December budget
surplus was larger than market predictions extended the morning
rally, dealers said.
   By about 12:30 p.m., the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was up 19.5 points, or 1 percent, at 1,887.2, just two points
below the day's best level of 1,889.2. The index registered its
minimum of 1,871.7 at the outset of official trading at 9 a.m.
   The June post-crash high was 1,879.3.
   Volume was 301.6 million shares compared with 250.6 million
shares at the same time Tuesday.
   The market's rise also was attributed to market makers being
short of stock, dealers said.
   ``We're short of just about everything,'' one market maker said,
``and whatever comes on the market is being snapped up in the blink
of an eye.''
   However, dealers detected a slowing in trading early in the
afternoon as players grew cautious ahead of the 1:30 p.m. release of
the U.S. trade report for November.
   ``As long as (the trade figures) aren't a disaster, we're locked
into an upward path,'' one analyst contended.

   A huge jump in imports helped widen the nation's trade deficit to
$12.5 billion in November, the largest imbalance in five months, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the gap between what the United
States imports and what it sells overseas was about 22 percent
higher than the October deficit of $10.3 billion.
   The sharply higher shortfall was blamed on an increase in
imports, which shot up to $39.7 billion, $1.6 billion above the
October level. Exports, which have been booming this year, declined
by $639 million to $27.2 billion.
   The November deficit was the largest since a $13.2 billion
imbalance in June.
   Shortly after the report was released the dollar fell in hectic
domestic trading while bond prices were narrowly mixed.
   The financial markets had weakened slightly on Tuesday amid
uncertainty over the trade figures, which have frequently moved the
markets in the past.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar's decline came in quiet trading
and reflected traders' reluctance to take risky positions before the
release of the report in Washington, analysts said.
   The consensus is for a trade deficit of about $11 billion,
compared with $10.35 billion in October, but the numbers are
renowned for defying predictions.
   A number sharply higher than $11 billion could possibly incite a
big selloff in dollars, while a much smaller number could encourage
a surge in demand for the U.S. currency.
   The dollar's decline also weighed on Wall Street, where the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials finished down 10.00 points to
2,214.64 and broader market indicators also declined.
   In the bond market, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond dipped
about $1.50 per $1,000 in face value.
   Among commodities, crude oil futures ended higher to extend their
recent rally to their highest levels since late 1987.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, finished 7 cents higher at $18.95 a barrel
Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   It was the highest settlement for a near-month contract since the
Nov. 5, 1987 close of $18.98 per barrel, and marked a nearly
$7-a-barrel rise since last autumn.
   Analysts say the energy markets lately have derived support from
speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
would be able to restrain crude oil output.
   In other economic news Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported
0.4 percent November growth rates in both business inventories and
business sales. Analysts said the report is an indicator that the
economy is likely to keep growing in 1989.
   Inventories rose to a seasonally adjusted $753.6 billion in
November, while sales reached $503.8 billion, for matching growth
rates of 0.4 percent.
   When not accompanied by increasing sales, rising inventories can
signal economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to
order production cuts and layoffs while they sell reserve goods.
   The November increase in inventories followed a small rise in
October and a 0.9 percent jump in September. It was the 23rd
straight month in which inventories had risen, but sales generally
have kept pace.

   The dollar fell against other major currencies in
Europe Wednesday after the U.S. government reported that the U.S.
trade deficit widened dramatically to a worse-than-expected $12.5
billion in November.
   The dollar, however, remained mostly higher against other
currencies compared with late Tuesday.
   Gold prices rose in morning trading.
   The dollar fell after the Commerce Department reported at 1:30
p.m. that the trade gap was 21.9 percent higher than the October
deficit of 10.3 billion dollars.
   Despite the dollar's quick decline, the trade figures were not
expected to jolt the financial markets, as poor trade reports have
in the past.
   That's because the foreign exchange markets had been expecting a
widening in the deficit, albeit a smaller one, to $11.1 billion.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7695 to buy one pound after the trade report was released, more
than $1.7643 before. On Tuesday, it cost $1.7680.
   Here are other dollar rates in Europe after the trade report was
released, with midmorning rates in parentheses, and compared with
late Tuesday's rates: 1.8525 (1.8560) West German marks, up from
1.8505; 1.5745 (1.5808) Swiss francs, down from 1.5755; 6.3210
(6.3435) French francs, up from 6.3085; 2.0975 (2.0983) Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0855; 1,361.00 (1,363.75) Italian lire, up from
1,354.00; 1.1966 (1.1975) Canadian dollars, down from 1.1973.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.20 yen to a closing 127.90 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 127.50 yen after the trade report and 127.95 yen
before.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $402.80 a troy ounce, up
from $402.25 late Tuesday. At midmorning, London bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $402.85 a troy ounce.
   In Zurich, gold was trading at a bid $403.05 compared with
$402.15 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 21 cents to close at a bid
$404.64.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market, where the metal
was trading at a bid price of $5.94 a troy ounce, compared with
Tuesday's $5.92.

<HEAD>Kerkorian Pumps in $180 Million, Outlines Plan for Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Kirk Kerkorian disclosed
he has pumped $180 million into MGM-UA Communications Co. as well as
developed a series of intricate blueprints for selling part of the
struggling movie company he controls.
   MGM-UA, maker of the current box-office hit ``Rain Man'' and TV's
``thirtysomething,'' announced Tuesday that Kerkorian's Tracinda
Corp. had bought 10 million shares of newly issued preferred stock
for $18 a share.
   That money, along with $85 million raised through new television
licensing agreements and sale of receivables, was used to pay off
all of the company's revolving credit line.
   The company also announced it would try to sell the United
Artists part of the conglomerate Kerkorian assembled a decade ago
from assets of UA and the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios. UA will
be shopped around by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, the former
employer of MGM-UA's new chairman and chief executive officer,
Jeffrey Barbakow.
   A sale of MGM-UA would likely take a form similar to a previous
deal that collapsed in July: The entire company would be sold, then
the MGM studio would be split off, with part being sold back to
present shareholders, including Kerkorian.
   The company has been saying for months that all or part of MGM-UA
was for sale.
   Barbakow said various potential byers had expressed interest in
the company, but that none had entered negotiations to buy it.
   A final aspect of the plan announced Tuesday is a rights offering
to shareholders other than Kerkorian, who owns more than 80 percent
of MGM-UA stock. Once the offering is approved by securities
regulators, shareholders will be allowed to buy additional shares of
the Series A Redeemable Preferred stock Kerkorian bought Tuesday.
   Analysts found little surprising in the announcement, since both
the pending rights offering and potential sale had been discussed
previously.
   The cash infusion from Kerkorian, by strengthening the company's
balance sheet, could make MGM-UA more attractive to a potential
buyer and overcome shareholder reluctance to buy the new preferred
stock, said Lee Isgur, who follows the company for PaineWebber in
New York.
   The convoluted plan to sell the company and then buy back part of
it recalls the failed June deal to split off the other half of the
company, MGM, and sell a part interest to Hollywood investor Burt
Sugarman and a pair of movie producers. That plan, which would have
left Kerkorian holding substantial shares of both MGM and UA,
collapsed two weeks after it was announced.
   ``Kirk always does something,'' Isgur said of the latest
proposal. ``Kirk Kerkorian gets bored, he likes to do something.''
   The UA sale being contemplated would include the movie studio,
film and home video rights and UA's 4,000-title film library that
includes the ``Rocky,'' James Bond and ``Pink Panther'' movies, as
well as rights to sequels.

<HEAD>Trade Surplus Narrows in 1988, But Was Widening in Recent Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus shrank in 1988, but was
widening in the year's last four months and hit a monthly record in
December, the Finance Ministry reported today.
   For all of 1988, the ministry said, the surplus on a customs
clearance basis amounted to $77.4 billion, down from $79.7 billion
in 1987.
   With the United States, Japan's 1988 surplus was $47.6 billion,
down from $52.1 billion in 1987. The December surplus with the
United States was $5.03 billion, up from $4.92 billion in the
previous December.
   The overall surplus in December hit a record $9.65 billion, up
from $8.61 billion in the previous December and from $6.56 billion
in November 1988.
   It was the fourth consecutive month when Japan's surplus exceeded
that of the corresponding month in 1987.
   Japan's major trading partners have been pressing it for years to
take greater steps toward reducing its huge trade surpluses.
   ``We hear the voices of concern, and we have concern,'' Mitoji
Yabunaka, director of the Foreign Ministry's Second North America
Division, said at a news conference. ``But at the same time, we see
encouraging trends.''
   In December exports grew 11.6 percent from a year earlier to
$26.1 billion, while imports grew 11.3 percent to $16.4 billion.
   Lower prices for crude oil, Japan's most important import
commodity, coupled with strong demand overseas for Japanese-made
computers, semiconductors and automobiles contributed to the record
December figure.

<TEXT>
   Audi of America Inc. is recalling about 35,000
1984-1988 5000 Turbo and a small number of 1989 Turbo cars because
of a fuel injection system problem that could cause an engine fire.
   Audi spokesman Joseph Bennett said the company was aware of about
a dozen such fires, resulting in no injuries or accidents.
   The company said Tuesday that high temperature and alcohol in
some fuels may harden injector seals, allowing fuel to escape into
the engine compartment and causing a fire.
   Audi will notify owners of affected vehicles during the next
week. Replacement parts will be available beginning early next month
and repairs will be performed free of charge, the automaker said.

<HEAD>Pritzkers Latest To Eye MCorp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A firm backed by Chicago's wealthy Pritzker family
is working with a New York investment banking firm on a possible bid
for MCorp, according to industry sources.
   The firm, called GKH Partners, also includes Corpus Christi
resident Melvyn Klein, the Houston Chronicle reported today.
   GKH is considering whether to send a team into MCorp to inspect
the books of the troubled banking company, the industry officials
said.
   If GKH goes in, it will be the third group to examine MCorp in
preparation for a possible bid. Kohlberg, Kravis &amp; Roberts, the
investment firm that won the bidding for RJR Nabisco last year, had
been visiting MCorp and left the bank last week. Wells Fargo &amp; Co.,
the giant San Francisco bank, also has paid a visit.
   The partners of GKH have worked with each other before. Last
year, Harry Gray founded a firm called Harry Gray, Melvyn Klein &amp;
Partners, whose backers included the Pritzkers. They joined in last
year's failed attempt by Resource Holdings, another Pritzker-backed
operation, to win the bidding for RJR Nabisco.
   The partners also have worked with the investment firm Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. Klein is a former special counsel to United
Technologies and a former senior vice president of DLJ. Dan Lufkin,
a founding partner of DLJ, is an adviser to the Gray Klein group.
   Gray Klein reportedly has equity of more than $500 million, and
has made several unsuccessful takeover attempts. Gray Klein was part
of a bidding group for Federated Department Stores. It is unclear
whether GKH and Gray Klein are one and the same.
   Neither Gray nor Klein could be reached for comment by The
Associated Press this morning.
   The Pritzkers, based in Chicago, are among America's wealthiest
families. Among their holdings are Hyatt Corp. Last year, they sold
Dallas-based Braniff to Philadelphia real estate investor Jeffrey
Chodorow for $105 million.
   Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette is acquainted with bank bailouts.
Last year, it teamed up with A. Robert Abboud to recapitalize First
City Bancorporation of Texas. The firm helped Abboud raise $500
million in private capital for the bank. The Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. provided another $1 billion in assistance.
   MCorp is the last of the major Texas banks to retain its
independence in the face of the state's banking crisis. Last
October, it announced that it needed federal assistance to survive.
   MCorp management has a recapitalization plan of its own that
calls for $1 billion in private money to be matched with $1 billion
in FDIC assistance.

   The operating rate at U.S. factories, mines and
utilities rose in December to the highest rate since November 1979,
the government reported today.
   The Federal Reserve Board said the use of industrial capacity
rose 0.1 percentage points to 84.2 percent last month, the highest
rate since 84.3 percent in November 1979. The operating rate for
November 1988 was a revised 84.1 percent.
   As capacity use edges toward 85 percent, economists fear
factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand,
leading to shortages and price increases.
   In an accompanying report, the Federal Reserve said industrial
production climbed 0.3 percent in December following a revised
increase of 0.4 percent in November.
   The Fed's industrial production index now stands at 140.2 percent
of its 1977 base, reflecting sharp gains in auto production and
continued strength in production of construction supplies.
   At manufacturing plants, the operating rate climbed to 84.4
percent last month from 84.3 percent in October. Production of
durable goods _ ``big-ticket'' items expected to last at least three
years _ rose 0.1 percentage points to 83.0. Production of
non-durable goods fell by a like margin to 86.4 percent.
   Industries with especially strong operating rates over the past
two years include primary metals, chemicals, fabricated metal
products, non-electrial machinery, autos and automotive parts.
   Use of motor vehicles and parts manufacturing capacity rose for
the fifth straight month to 88.1 percent, up from 85.5 percent in
November.
   The December operating rate at utilities was 81.9 percent, up
from 81.3 percent a month earlier. In the mining sector, which
includes oil and gas drilling, the operating rate was up 0.1
percentage points to 83.3 percent.
   The Federal Reserve's production index has not declined since
September 1987, reflecting an export-driven manufacturing boom
accompanied by a surge in spending for capital equipment to expand
and modernize factories.
   Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.3 percent in
December following a revised increase at the same rate for the month
earlier. Automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.9 million
units, up from 7.6 million in November. Production of light trucks
also rose sharply.
   Output at mines was unchanged in December after a 1.4 percent
rise a month earlier. Production at utilities was up 0.8 percent
from November.
   Total output at factories, mines and utilities was up 4.7 percent
from a year earlier.

   The stock market was mixed today, faced with
mildly disappointing news on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.60 to 2,208.04
in the first half hour of trading.
   But gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 445 up, 399 down and 569
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.74 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit widened to $12.51 billion in November from a revised
$10.26 billion the month before.
   The latest number exceeded most advance estimates on Wall Street,
although analysts said it caused no great dismay among traders.
   Meanwhile, the market also absorbed the news of quarterly
earnings from International Business Machines Corp. that fell
slightly short of expectations.
   IBM, which posted profits of $3.97 a share for the fourth quarter
against $3.47 in the like period a year earlier, dropped 1 to 122~
in early trading.
   RJR Nabisco rose [ to 95]. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. said it
had lined up more than $14 billion in bank loans to help finance its
buyout of the company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.30 to 159.18. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .49 at 316.08.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.00 to
2,214.64.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 615 up, 807 down and 519 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 143.93 million shares, against 117.38
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Steinburg Give $25 Million To Penn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saul P. Steinberg, chairman and chief
executive officer of Reliance Group Holdings Inc., has pledged $25
million to the University of Pennsylvania, Penn President Sheldon
Hackney said today.
   Steinberg's gift to his alma mater is the largest single
contribution in the Ivy League School's history, Hackney said.
   The money will be shared by the Wharton School, which will get
$15 million, and the school of arts and sciences, which will receive
$10 million.
   Administrators of arts and sciences, in consultation with
Steinberg, have decided to invest the entire $10 million in Penn's
English Department for faculty and student recruitment.
   Steinberg is chairman of the Wharton School's Board of Overseers
and has been instrumental in supporting the strategic plan developed
by the school.
   As part of that plan, the school will endow five school-wide
professorships, create 20 ``term chairs'' for use in a program to
recruit young professors, establish a financial aid program for
masters of business degrees, provide additional funding for the
Steinberg Conference Center and increase funding for new academic
programs.
   ``All of us at Penn are deeply grateful to Saul Steinberg for
this act of leadership,'' Hackney said. ``He has been a champion of
the university for many years, and his latest bold step is pivotal
in our campaign to strengthen Penn's position in the front rank of
America's universities.''
   The money to the English department will be used to endow four
professorships, create an annual visiting professorship for a
nationally renowned writer, fund eight fellowships for graduate
students and establish a humanities fund that will extend the
department's connections with other departments of the university.
   Steinberg received his bachelor's degree in economics from
Wharton in 1959.

<HEAD>Zeroing In On New Breed of Tax-Exempt Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Invest $450 now, get $1,000 back in the year
2000, and pay no income tax on your earnings!
   If that's the sort of proposition that appeals to you, you might
want to check out an increasingly popular investment known as
zero-coupon municipal bonds.
   Despite their somewhat ponderous name, municipal zeros aren't all
that complicated.
   They are close cousins, in fact, of U.S. savings bonds, and can
be used for many of the same purposes and goals as savings bonds.
   One big difference: While you may well eventually have to pay
taxes on the money you earn from savings bonds, there is no federal
tax on income from the typical municipal zero issued by a state or
local government.
   Savings bonds, of course, are sold through a long-established
national program, and are easily accessible at banks and other
financial institutions, or even from your employer through payroll
deductions.
   Municipal zeros, which trace their origins back just a few years,
aren't yet so widely available.
   But inquiries at brokerage firms in your area may lead you to one
of several firms that creates zeros from ordinary municipal bonds
through a process, called stripping, that separates them from their
current interest payments.
   The Cleveland-based brokerage firm of Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben
Inc. calls the municipal zeros it sells Stripped Tax-Exempt
Participations, or STEPs.
   A few states, in addition, have begun offering bonds specifically
designed as zeros.
   In December, Connecticut offered the first in what is planned as
twice-a-year sales of College Savings Bonds with maturities of five
to 20 years. For Connecticut residents, they are exempt from both
federal and state tax.
   Since zeros pay no current interest, they are obviously
unsuitable for people who want or need income from their investments
to help them meet living expenses. Rather, they are designed to
appeal to people saving for some future goal.
   Buyers of zeros pay a fraction of the bonds' face value that is
calculated to produce a certain annual compound growth rate until
the bonds are redeemed on maturity at face value.
   They eliminate the uncertainty that comes with conventional bonds
about what reinvestment options will be available for interest as it
is paid out over time.
   ``We can think of no investment vehicle whose results are more
clearly defined,'' says Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben in its monthly
publication Investor News. ``For that reason, zeros are of great
value in financial planning.''
   Drawbacks and possible pitfalls? Yes, there are several.
   In their eagerness to get a tax break, many buyers of municipals
often don't bother to calculate whether they might actually do
better, even after taxes, in some other type of investment.
   With a municipal zero, you can know precisely what after-tax
dollar amount you can expect to receive in 1995, or 2000, or 2005.
   But because of inflation, there is no way of telling in advance
how much purchasing power those dollars will have _ for example,
whether they will cover a college tuition payment or not.
   Furthermore, if inflation increases, zeros offer you no
protection. In fact, assuming that the general level of market
interest rates rises along with inflation, the value of a zero will
fall should you want to sell it before maturity.
   The automatic compounding feature of zeros that appeals to so
many investors actually exaggerates this effect. So their market
values tend to fluctuate even more than those of conventional bonds
with the ups and downs of interest rates.

<HEAD>Texas Eastern `Poison Pills' Spawn Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Texas Eastern Corp. stockholders filed a
lawsuit seeking to strike down anti-takeover measures they claim
could block a $2.6 billion offer from Coastal Corp.
   The suit filed in Houston federal court Tuesday said the measures
include protections designed to drastically increase the cost of
buying Texas Eastern and golden parachutes that would give lump-sum
severance payments to some executives fired after a takeover.
   The suit, filed by Frederick Rand and Elliot Kurlander both of
New York state, contends that Texas Eastern and three directors
might use such anti-takeover measures to entrench the directors'
positions and to prevent shareholders from considering tender offers.
   The suit claims that Houston-based Texas Eastern and the
directors could defeat Coastal's offer unless they are blocked from
using ``obstructionist'' strategies.
   Texas Eastern spokesman Fred Wichlep said company officials could
not comment because they had not seen the suit.
   Named in the suit were Texas Eastern and directors I. David
Bufkin, Henry H. King and Dennis R. Hendrix. Bufkin is chairman of
the board, King is vice chairman and Hendrix is Texas Eastern's
president and chief executive officer.
   The two stockholders say in their suit that Texas Eastern took
anti-takeover measures by adopting a poison pill plan. The plan,
which comes into play 10 days after a takeover bid, entitles Texas
Eastern shareholders to buy shares of the acquiring company at half
the market cost of those shares.
   Golden parachutes for some executives also were put into place to
thwart a takeover, the suit alleges. Golden parachutes are
employment agreements that provide a company's key executives with
lucrative severance benefits in the event that control of the firm
changes hands and management shifts subsequently occur.
   The parachutes go into effect after an outsider acquires 45
percent or more of the stock or controls a majority of directors on
the board.
   The parachutes are triggered if a new owner fires any of the top
nine executives in the company, including Hendrix, any time up to
three years after the takeover.
   The parachutes require the owner to pay the fired executive a
lump sum in cash equal to four times his annual wages, including
salary and bonuses; all retirement and pension benefits that the
executive would have received if he had continued to work four years
more; and insurance benefits for four more years.
   Coastal announced Monday that it would make a cash tender offer
of $42 per share for all outstanding Texas Eastern common stock on
Tuesday. The offer expires Feb. 13, unless it is extended.
   If the buyout is successful, Houston-based Coastal would become
the nation's largest natural gas pipeline company.
   Texas Eastern stock was the most active on the New York Stock
Exchange Tuesday. It closed up 1] at 46, after rising 14} on Monday.
Coastal stock closed at 34 Tuesday, down an eighth.
   Coastal holds 2.4 million shares of Texas Eastern's 53.1 million
shares outstanding. The block of shares makes Coastal one of Texas
Eastern's largest shareholders.
   Coastal also filed suit Monday asking that Texas Eastern be
prevented from filing any legal action arising from the tender offer
in any court other than that of U.S. District Judge Lynn N. Hughes
in Houston.
   Hughes scheduled a Feb. 7 hearing on Coastal's suit, which
includes challenges to Texas Eastern's poison pill protections and
to anti-takeover statues in Delaware, Tennessee and Louisiana.
   A lawyer for the two stockholders indicated that the investors
will ask Hughes to consolidate their suit with Coastal's action.

<HEAD>Say SEC Wants Drexel's Junk Bond Operation Moved to New York</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 8th graf with no comment from SEC spokeswoman.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission wants
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to move its lucrative ``junk bond''
division from Beverly Hills, Calif., to New York as a condition for
settling a massive fraud complaint against the firm, sources
familiar with their negotiations said today.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed an
account in the Wall Street Journal that said SEC negotiators made
the demand in talks late last week, toughening an earlier request
that Drexel only move its supervision authority over the division to
the firm's New York headquarters.
   The new condition is important because Drexel must settle with
the SEC as part of a broader plea bargain deal reached Dec. 21 with
the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. Under that deal, the firm will
plead guilty to six fraud felonies and pay a record $650 million in
fines and restitution.
   Drexel's high-yield ``junk bond'' division is considered the
firm's most profitable operation. Dismantling and moving it to New
York could cripple Drexel's renowned prowess in the $175 billion
market for junk bonds, commonly used to finance takeovers and the
growth of small and midsize companies.
   The new SEC demand came at a time when many Drexel high-yield
bond traders already are upset over the firm's decision to reach a
plea bargain with the government rather than fight longstanding
charges of securities fraud that grew out of the Ivan Boesky insider
trading scandal more than two years ago.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on the SEC
negotiations or whether they were close to resolution.
   But he said the firm ``does not believe the high-yield bond
department can be successfully mmoved to New York since any effort
to do so would destroy the department and do irreparable damage to
the high-yield market.''
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue declined to comment on the Drexel
negotiations. The agency's policy is to refrain from commenting on
any impending enforcement matter.
   The high-yield department was moved from New York to California
in 1978 by its architect Michael Milken, a senior Drexel financier
who is expected to be indicted on securities fraud and other charges.
   Unlike Drexel, Milken has continued to assert his innocence but
has been under intensifying pressure to negotiate a plea bargain.
   The SEC accused Drexel, Milken and three other senior aides of
wide-ranging fraud in a civil enforcement action filed in September.
Most of the accusations were linked to Drexel's relationship with
Boesky, the now-imprisoned inside trader who turned state's evidence
in exchange for lenient treatment.

<HEAD>IBM Earnings Rise 12.4 Percent In Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to ADD Wang Laboratories earnings; fall in IBM stock
price; analyst quotes.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. said today its earnings
rose 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter and that it had trimmed its
staff even more than expected through voluntary separation
incentives.
   The stock fell 75 cents a share at $123.12{ a share in morning
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, apparently because IBM told
some analysts that its tax rate might be higher and its revenue
lower in 1989 than the analysts had forecasted.
   The world's largest computer company said it earned $2.35
billion, or $3.97 a share, up from $2.09 billion, or $3.47 a share,
a year earlier. Revenue rose to $20.0 billion from $18.3 billion in
the year-earlier period.
   For all of 1988, IBM said its earnings rose 10.4 percent to $5.81
billion, or $9.80 a share, from $5.26 billion, or $8.72 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent to $59.7 billion from $55.3
billion.
   Also today, Wang Laboratories Inc. said its earnings tumbled to
$1 million, or 1 cent per share, in its second fiscal quarter, from
$34.1 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. The
office-automation company said revenue fell to $760.7 million from
$784.7 million a year earlier.
   John F. Akers, IBM's chairman and chief executive, said IBM
benefited from increases in efficiency as well as positive response
by customers to improved products ``in every segment of our
business.''
   IBM said it recorded a gain of $220 million on payments from
Fujitsu Ltd., its Japanese rival, under an arbitration order that
ended a software copyright dispute.
   But that gain was more than offset by a charge of $270 million to
cover unexpected costs of consolidating its operations.
   The company said 6,500 employees had chosen to leave the company
under a voluntary separation incentive program, even more than the
4,000 that the company had expected when it announced the program as
part of a $600 million consolidation program.
   The separation offer was made to some manufacturing and
headquarters employees. IBM spokeswoman Marti Mattia said it had
been especially popular with heaquarters employees.
   Stephen Cohen, an analyst for SoundView Financial Group in
Stamford, Conn., said he had heard that IBM told some analysts its
1989 tax rate might be 2 percentage points higher than in 1988, and
that revenue growth might be 1 percentage point lower than some
analysts' forecasts.
   Cohen said fourth-quarter results were good. ``Revenue is strong
and operating margins improved nicely,'' he said.
   ``It was a good quarter,'' said Jay Stevens, an analyst for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. ``Some hot money moved in to anticipate a
better-than-expected quarter'' and moved out when the hopes failed
to materialize, he said, explaining the stock drop.
   ``The IBM company is continuing to show improvement in our
product line, our relationships with our customers and our financial
performance,'' Akers said. ``We are managing for the long term, and
with the steps we are taking, we remain confident about the future
of our business.''
   Wang Laboratories, based in Lowell, Mass., said its earnings for
the six months ended Dec. 31 were $14.1 million, or 9 cents a share,
down from $56.6 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue edged up to $1.483 billion from $1.477 billion a year
earlier.
   The IBM and Wang announcements came a day after Apple Computer
Inc. announced a 16 percent earnings gain in its fourth quarter.

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down West Virginia County Property Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today unanimously struck down
a tax in a West Virginia county that permitted some property to be
taxed at up to 35 times more than neighboring comparable property.
   But the court, referring to the county tax as ``aberrational,''
declined to say whether similar state taxes also are
unconstitutional.
   The ruling thus appears to leave untouched ironically named state
``welcome stranger'' property tax systems that result in
dramatically higher taxes for newly purchased property.
   A ``welcome stranger'' provision is a key part of California's
Proposition 13 property tax rollback approved by that state's voters.
   The court today threw out a Webster County, W.Va., tax that was
challenged principally by Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co., a
subsidiary of Allegheny Power System Inc.
   The coal company opposed a change that raised the assessed value
of 7,400 acres of Webster County land it owned from $488,000 to
$12.3 million in one year. The company bought the land in 1974 for
about $24.6 million and sold it, along with mineral rights, for
$29.8 million in 1982.
   Three other coal companies, East Kentucky Energy, Oneida Coal and
Shamrock Coal, joined the challenge.
   Eastern Kentucky Energy is a subsidiary of Shell Oil Co. Oneida
and Shamrock are subsidiaries of Sun Oil Inc.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court today,
said West Virginia's Constitution and laws ``provide that all
property of the kind held by (the coal companies) shall be taxed at
a rate uniform throughout the state according to its estimated
market value. The relative undervaluation of comparable property in
Webster County over time therefore denies (the coal companies) the
equal protection of law.''
   In a key footnote, Rehnquist said, ``We need not and do not
decide today whether the Webster County assessment method would
stand on a different footing if it were the law of a state generally
applied instead of the aberrational enforcement policy it appears to
be.''
   For example, Proposition 13 in California generally provides that
property will be assessed at its 1975-l976 value and reassessed only
when sold or improved through construction.
   The premise is that the taxes should be based on the original
cost of property and not on unrealized paper gains pegged to
inflation.
   Today's ruling overturned a 1987 decision by the West Virginia
Supreme Court of Appeals.
   The case is Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. vs. Webster County,
87-1303.

<HEAD>Camaro Continues Lock on No. 1 Stolen Car Spot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chevrolet Camaro is continuing its lock on the
No. 1 spot on a vehicle valuation services's list of most-stolen
cars.
   Certified Collateral Corp. of Chicago, which sets values of
stolen vehicles for insurance companies, said today the 1986 Camaro
was the most-stolen car in 1988.
   It was followed by the 1987 Camaro, the 1984 Camaro, the 1985
Camaro and the 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.
   The company began compiling lists of the most frequently reported
stolen domestic and imported cars in 1985, and every year since then
a Camaro has topped the domestic list, CCC spokesman Tom Figel said.
   Among imported cars, the 1987 Hyundai Excel topped the 1988 CCC
list. It was followed by the 1985 Mazda RX7 GT and Toyota Corollas
from 1983, 1982 and 1981.
   For its 1988 list, CCC compiled 111,440 insurance claims for
stolen cars. The company defined a stolen car as one in which the
entire vehicle was taken, and did not include break-ins or wheel
thefts, for example.
   The 1986 Camaro amounted to 0.9 percent of the theft claims
handled by CCC.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade in what many analysts
said was a technical correction following two days of steep losses
in the corn and soybean markets.
   ``The general feeling is that after the big break of the last two
days, you're technically oversold and you're entitled to some sort
of rebound,'' said Jerry Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp's
floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   The recent drop in corn and soybean prices came in reaction to a
government report that showed larger-than-expected supplies of those
commodities.
   Analysts said additional buying this morning was linked to higher
soybean meal prices in Europe and news that South Korea had
purchased 200,000 metric tons of U.S. corn overnight.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to 2 cents higher with

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit widened dramatically to
$12.5 billion in November, the largest imbalance in five months, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the gap between what the United
States imports and what it sells overseas was 21.9 percent higher
than the October deficit of $10.3 billion.
   The sharply higher deficit was blamed on a big jump in imports,
which shot up to $39.7 billion, $1.6 billion above the October
level. Exports, which have been booming this year, declined by $639
million to $27.2 billion.
   The November deficit was the largest since a $13.2 billion
imbalance in June.
   In the past, a sharp worsening of the nation's trade performance
has sent shock waves through financial markets. However, today's
report had less of an impact.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks edged down by more
than 6 points in early trading but gainers slightly outnumbered
losers in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
issues.
   ``The markets took this trade number in stride and went on,''
said Jay Goldinger, chief economist of Capital Insight, a Beverly
Hills, Calif., investment firm.
   However, economists said the big jump in the November deficit
showed that the country has a long way to go before its trade
difficulties are over.
   ``We have a serious competitiveness problem in this country,''
said Lawrence Chimerine, head of the Wefa Group, an economic
consulting firm. ``There's a limit to how much you can improve by
cutting costs and driving the dollar lower.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``It is true
there is a slight jump this month, and that is always of concern,
but it does fly in the face of a trend that is going down and in the
right direction, and we trust that this is an aberration and does
not change the overall trend.''
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity termed the report
``disappointing. While our exports remain strong, the robust
domestic economy continues to draw in imports at near-record levels
and the trade deficit remains too high.''
   Verity said that while the trade deficit was running 20 percent
below the all-time high set in 1987, the improvement has leveled off
in recent months.
   ``All of this means that we have a long way to go,'' he said in a
statement. ``We must continue to improve our efficiency and quality
at home and pursue our efforts to reduce trade barriers abroad.''
   In other economic reports today, the Federal Reserve said that
the operating rate at U.C. factories, mines and utilities rose in
December to 84.2 percent, the highest rate in nine years.
   Even with the November deterioration, the trade deficit for the
first 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of $137.3
billion, almost 20 percent below the all-time imbalance of $170.3
billion set in 1987.
   This big improvement in trade has been largely responsible for
the overall prosperity the country enjoyed last year. But analysts
have begun to worry that the trade improvement, which was powered by
a surge in export sales, is in danger of stalling out this year.
   If that occurs, it raises the threat that the new Bush
administration will have to deal with a possible recession, or at
the very least that the new president will be faced with growing
cries to erect new trade barriers to protect American manufacturers.
   ``This is curtains for any hope that we are going to get the
trade deficit under control any time soon,'' said Michael Evans,
head of a Washington economic forecasting firm.
   Many economists believe that the U.S. dollar will have to fall
further to spur further sales of American exports. But the Bush
administration is worried that sharp declines in the dollar could
worsen U.S. inflation by increasing the cost of imports.
   For November, the 4.2 percent rise in imports reflected big
increases in imports of business capital equipment, which rose by
$1.1 billion, and consumer goods other than autos, which climbed by
$697 million.
   The rise in capital goods reflected increases in U.S. purchases
of iron and steel products, airplanes and heavy equipment such as
metal working machinery.
   American industry has been rushing to expand and modernize
production facilities to meet increased demand. However, much of the
expansion has come through the purchase of foreign capital equipment.
   The auto category actually dropped by $229 million during
November. The nation's foreign oil bill fell a slight 0.4 percent to
$3.13 billion, reflecting a drop in both the amount of oil imported
and the price, which fell to an average price of $13.38 per barrel.
   The 2.3 percent drop in exports in November reflected declines in
sales of U.S. farm products and capital goods.
   By country, the deficit with Japan was the largest, a $5.3
billion imbalance, followed by a $2 billion deficit with Western
Europe.
   The overall trade figures are adjusted to reflect normal seasonal
variations. The deficits with individual countries are not.
   Evans said he expected the deficit would be frozen at the current
high levels for all of 1989 as the demand for foreign goods on the
part of American consumers shows little sign of slacking despite the
higher prices.
   ``This is curtains for any hope that we are going to get the
trade deficit under control anytime soon,'' he said.
   Data Resources Inc., another consulting firm, is also predicting
little progress on the trade front this year based on a belief that
higher prices for imported goods will largely offset further gains
in export sales.
   The Reagan administration launched an effort in September 1985 to
drive the value of the dollar lower to make American goods more
competitive on overseas markets.
   The effort took far longer to show results than many had expected
and has yet to dampen the steady increase in imports even though the
products now cost more.

<HEAD>17 Percent Of Biggest U.S. Firms Were Wooed By Foreigners In 1988:
Survey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign firms approached 17 percent of the largest
U.S. companies about possible takeovers last year, according to a
study released today by Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate
School of Management.
   Only a handful of such initial approaches by overseas firms
became public or amounted to a bid, the survey found.
   The study _ a survey of the chief executive officers of 95
corporations with annual sales of at least $1 billion _ also found
that while 60 percent of the respondents felt foreign ownership
tends to maximize shareholder value, just over half said they would
prefer a U.S. firm as a new owner if they were taken over.
   Slightly less than 23 percent of the CEOs reported being
approached by a prospective domestic buyer last year.
   Two-thirds of the chief executives responding to the survey said
they were more interested in joint ventures and similar linkups with
foreign companies than they were in selling.
   Northwestern University Professor Edward Zajac, project director
for the survey, said he was surprised by the number of firms that
reported overtures by foreign companies.
   Zajac said the survey showed ``the world is getting smaller'' and
U.S. firms are finding that to survive in an increasingly complex
world, they must turn to international alliances.

   Company sources confirmed there would be a major investment but
declined to disclose the amount.
   One member of Ford management said an important announcement was
expected this month. Workers said they learned of the proposed
spending plans from a bulletin distributed in the plant.
   Some union members said they believe the spending plan ensures
that Ford will keep the plant open through the 1990s. There has been
concern among union members that the plant, which employs 2,800,
might be phased out.
   In addition to the new presses and other machinery, the company
also will be earmarking funds for use in moving rail lines inside
the plant.
   The Ford spending plan follows an announcement last July that GM
was investing $80 million in the Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada Group
Tonawanda Engine Plant to build Chevrolet's new eight-cylinder Mark
V engine. Early this month it was learned that GM planned another
$26 million expenditure to increase the plant's production of its
popular six-cylinder, 4.3-liter engine.

<HEAD>Codfish ``Curio'' Leads Portuguese Quality Wine Assault</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AZEITAO, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Would you believe a wine called
``Codfish Manor?''
   You should when it's a fine Portuguese red, grown by Americans on
their 15th century manor, then marketed by a hard-hitting Australian
intent on changing Portugal's image as the purveyor of cheap and
unrefined wine.
   Quinta de Bacalhoa _ old Portuguese for Codfish Manor _ is a
Cabernet Sauvignon from Bordeaux vines planted in 1974 by Tom and
Cathryn Scoville of Washington D.C. on their 30 acre
renaissance-style farm or ``quinta'' in the village of Azeitao 25
miles south of Lisbon.
   The Scovilles inherited Bacalhoa from Tom's New York grandmother
Orlena Scoville, who bought it tumbledown in the 1930s and restored
it to a grandeur once known under the original constructor, the
mother of King Manuel I.
   Since the first harvest in 1979, Bacalhoa red has become one of
Portugal's better-known ``curio'' vintages that are beginning to
rival the worldwide fame of historical exports like port and madeira.
   ``In Portugal, single quinta wines like this are sold as
high-quality, connoisseur wines, in other European countries as a
quality value-for-money wine and in the United States as a bit of a
`curio' wine,'' said Peter Bright, an energetic Australian enologist
who produces and markets Bacalhoa at Joao Pires wineries in Pinhal
Novo, near Azeitao.
   Bright arrived from Sydney in 1980 and revolutionized the
company's antiquated winemaking processes _ developing brand names
and mass-producing wines for other exporters.
   Ninety percent of the company's mass-produced wine goes under
contract to rival winery Fonseca International for their famous
Lancers brand. But Bright sticks to more traditional methods for
finishing Bacalhoa.
   The wine is fermented without stems, painstakingly clarified with
egg whites and aged for five years in Portuguese oak barrels,
toasted on the inside to give the wine, Bright says, a different
taste from regular Cabernets.
   It seems tradition pays off.
   Robert Joseph of London's Sunday Telegraph called Bacalhoa
``Portugal's award-winning answer to claret,'' when it won that
paper's 1984 Wine of the Year award.
   According to the monthly wine magazine Decanter, Bacalhoa's
``provenance will fool most party guests.''
   More than half the annual 8,000-case production goes abroad, with
one-fourth of the exports secured by the British grocer-chain
Sainsbury _ the Scovilles' first buyer in 1979.
   With all of Bacalhoa already devoted to vines, and only two small
nearby areas having suitable red limestone soil, expansion is
impossible.
   But many Portuguese vintners agree that single-quinta wines
should not be produced en masse, but rather be the ``flagship'' of
the country's wine industry.
   These wines constitute only a fraction of Portugal's table wine
exports, but the Institute for Foreign Trade hopes their high
quality will change foreign connoisseurs' perceptions that wine from
Europe's West Coast can only be port or a famous rose.
   ``Portugal has great potential to produce wines of similar
quality to the minor French classics,'' Bright says.
   The Institute for Foreign Trade says Portuguese table wine
exports fetched $3 billion in 1987, up from $2.6 billion a year
earlier.
   Exports to the United States increased by 11 percent to 2.2
million gallons in 1987 from 1986, while the U.S. market share of
rival wine exporters in Europe fell.
   But if quality is the theme of Portugal's push to become a fine
wine exporter, wine buffs Charles Metcalfe and Kathryn McWhirter are
cautious.
   In their book ``The Wines of Spain and Portugal,'' they see only
a limited prospect for quality control. Part of the reason is the
temptation among some vintners to sacrifice good standards for more
sales.
   Mario Pinto, a vintner of the northern winery Borges &amp; Irmao,
also has expressed concern about the outlook for the industry
because competitors are sharply discounting.
   He said quinta wines ``are the crowning achievement of Portuguese
winemaking, but worrying signs have begun to appear that some
exporters, greedy for market share, are offering wines at 30 percent
below market price.''
   He said there is concern that the Portuguese may fall into the
same trap that hurt German winemakers, who lost a substantial part
of their 40 percent share of the British market when standards fell
following a price-cutting war among exporters.

<HEAD>Sears' Savior Rises To A New Challenge</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CX3 of Jan. 16</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cold late-afternoon rain whipped the dark
surfaces of the looming Sears Tower while, inside, Edward A. Brennan
rose to make a crucial sales pitch to a roomful of skeptical stock
analysts.
   The chairman of Sears, Roebuck and Co. had to be tired. He'd
spent nearly two hours that morning outlining a major shift in
Sears' retailing strategy to securities analysts in New York. Here
he was back in Chicago, doing it again.
   If Brennan was beat, he didn't show it. Looking poised and
confident in a dark gray suit and red tie, he stood at the podium
for 1{ hours and painted a bright, if blurry, picture of the new
Sears store.
   A ``store of superstores.'' A cluster of ``power centers.'' A
lean competitor fit for battle with K mart, Wal-Mart and the
electronics specialty chains.
   He said Sears' planned switch to ``everyday low pricing,'' a
strategy unveiled a week earlier, on Halloween, was ``designed to
energize our company and move us forward from a position of
leadership.''
   The proposed sale of the Sears Tower, Brennan said, signaled the
company's commitment to ``a low-cost mentality.''
   When it was over, many of the analysts remained unconvinced that
Sears was on the right track _ the one that would reverse a 4-year
slide in its retailing market share and signal a return to steady
profit growth.
   Some were disappointed that Brennan had not offered a more
detailed description of the Sears store he sees emerging.
   One thing was clear: Sears' 54-year-old chairman had taken hold
with both hands of the latest and perhaps the most crucial challenge
facing the nation's largest retailer. History has shown that when
Brennan tackles a Sears retailing problem, he ususally solves it.
   Brennan has been called a retailing genius, and leading
103-year-old Sears into its second century has been called his
destiny.
   His 29-year climb from men's furnishings at a Sears store in
Madison, Wis., to the chairman's office on the 68th floor of the
Sears Tower _ a rapid ascent by big-business standards _ is the
stuff of corporate legends.
   The fact that he began his working life as a scrappy Irish kid
from a broken home on Chicago's West Side makes his a classic,
up-by-his-bootstraps American success story as well.
   But it is Brennan's ties to Sears' past _ his grandfather,
father, mother and two uncles labored for the company _ and his
triumphant turnaround of its fortunes in the early 1980s as head of
the merchandise group, that already have reserved for him a place in
the Sears pantheon of heroes and saviors.
   Such an honor is not easily won.
   ``Sears is his life,'' said Gene Harmon, retired head of public
affairs for Sears who now lives in Albuquerque, N.M. ``More than
anyone I know, he's been completely involved in Sears. He pretty
much lives his work.''
   Others have speculated that Brennan, Sears' chairman since
October 1985, will work to death. But in a recent interview in a
Sears Tower conference room overlooking Chicago's sprawling West
Side, he was relaxed and congenial.
   ``The Lord has blessed me with pretty good energy and we usually
go at it pretty strong,'' Brennan said with a grin that cracked an
eye-level crease across his broad face.
   Brennan's amiable air cooled when asked whether Sears _ the
originator of mail-order sales and one of the first retailers to
offer credit to shoppers _ had become a follower in its decision to
embrace everyday low pricing.
   The strategy, pioneered by discount chains, was recently adopted
by Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., also based in Chicago and run by Brennan's
younger brother, Bernard.
   ``One could say why not two, three, four years ago,'' Brennan
said. ``Obviously, we think this is the time to make the change and
we are doing it.''
   Everday low pricing means carrying many national brands and
offering them regularly at low prices, often with few salespeople.
The shift marks a sharp turn in direction for Sears, which built its
business on store brands such as Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard,
with frequent, heavily advertised sales on selected models.
   Brennan acknowledged that the switch, which will be implemented
this year, represent ``a major change for us.'' But he said it posed
a different challenge than the ``Store of the Future'' changeover he
engineered in the early 1980s.
   ``It's not as major a change as that because it doesn't involve
physical remodeling of stores and it will take place in a more
concentrated period of time,'' he said. ``This is much less of a
physical challenge than the Store of the Future. It's more of a
marketing challenge.''
   But, Brennan said, ``it's important to note that you are never at
the point where it's done.
   ``When we get to the point where everyday low pricing is
implemented, we still will be changing and growing. That's one of
the things that makes retailing so exciting: you're never there.''
   Sears is more than a retailer of merchandise. It's financial
businesses _ Allstate Insurance, Dean Witter Financial Services, and
Coldwell Banker Real Estate _ brought in 42 percent of the company's
$48.44 billion in revenues in 1987.
   Brennan is comfortable with the financial-services businesses,
but he grew passionate while discussing what he called ``the lure,
the magic of retailing.''
   ``There's a very specific challenge that you can see, feel touch
and smell,'' he said. ``And when you address that challenge, you can
see the results very quickly and you get a real feeling of
satisfaction from that.''
   On a larger scale, Brennan hopes to increase job satisfaction
among employees of the Sears Merchandise Group by moving the
8,000-person division out of the Sears Tower and into more
horizontal surroundings. The company has not yet decided whether to
keep the division's headquarters in the Chicago area.
   ``When you are housed in a vertical structure, you have less
people interaction than when you are in a low-rise, campus-type
environment,'' he said. ``You have a more cohesive organization when
there's more people interaction.''
   Brennan, a golf and tennis player in his leisure time, called
running Sears ``a very stimulating, challenging, engrossing
experience'' but said he occasionally toys with teaching at a
graduate business school.
   Brennan and his wife Lois, the childhood sweetheart he married in
1955, have raised six children and some work for other retailers.
Brennan said he's never pushed them to join Sears.
   ``I think it puts pressure on members of a family to work in a
company where the father is in a high position,'' he said. Besides,
``it's not my decision. I think they're very happy doing what
they're doing.''

<HEAD>London Shares Surge To Close At New Post-Crash High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite disappointment with the latest set of U.S.
trade figures, London stocks extended their recent broad-based rally
in active trading Wednesday, reaching their best levels since the
1987 stock crash.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed up 24.4
points, or 1.3 percent, at 1,892.1, well above the previous
post-crash closing high of 1,879.3, reached in June.
   Volume also continued its recent brisk pace, with 603 million
shares changing hands, compared with 424.4 million shares on Tuesday.
   Equities took their cue from the dollar, which also successfully
weathered news that the U.S. trade deficit was a wider-than-expected
$12.5 billion in November, dealers and analysts said.
   A buying spree by institutions drove prices higher in early
trading. In addition, a shortage of stock held by market makers
discouraged any fall in prices even after business tapered off,
dealers said.
   ``London has been rather late as far as other equity markets go
in reaching a post-crash high,'' said Bill Smith, equities market
strategist at Prudential-Bache Capital Funding Ltd.
   Sentiment has turned bullish amid growing evidence of a cooling
of inflationary pressures on the British economy, the analyst said.

   Rockwell International Corp.'s federal trial
on charges of overbilling the Air Force for work on a satellite was
delayed until Thursday amid reports the company was negotiating a
guilty plea.
   The trial in U.S. District Court was scheduled to begin Tuesday.
   Prosecutors and the company declined to comment on the reasons,
but the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, quoting sources
familiar with the case, said the company was discussing a bargain to
plead guilty in exchange for reduced penalties.
   Rockwell, the El Segundo-based high-technology manufacturer that
made the B-1B bomber and works on the space shuttle, is charged with
seven counts of conspiracy, mail fraud and contempt.
   The company is accused of overcharging the Air Force by $446,000
for work on the Navstar global Positioning satellite in 1983. The
governmentalleges Rockwell's satellite systems division in Seal
Beach submitted bills for the same work under two contracts.
   The company has denied wrongdoing and maintained its own official
alerted the Air Force to the problem.
   The charges carry a maximum fine of $1 million, and if Rockwellis
found guilty, the company could be suspended from bidding on
government contracts.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges Despite Intervention, Trade Report; Gold Steady</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: AMer planned by 5:30 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar defied gravity in hectic European
trading Wednesday, surging despite a bearish set of U.S. trade
figures and two reported rounds of central bank intervention.
   Gold prices were mostly higher.
   Dealers were surprised by the dollar's ability to shrug off the
bearish factors, and predicted the U.S. currency would rise further.
   News that the U.S. trade deficit widened sharply to $12.5 billion
in November from a revised $10.3 billion in October surprised the
market and knocked the dollar down, dealers said.
   The market expected a November deficit of about $11 billion.
   Dealers said the dollar's reaction reflected a markdown in rates
rather than any heavy selling, and the U.S. currency immediately
bounced higher. That triggered a round of concerted intervention by
the U.S. Federal Reserve, the West German Bundesbank and the central
banks of France and Italy, dealers said.
   Despite the first round of intervention, the dollar continued to
climb higher, and a second round of dollar sales by the Bundesbank,
the Fed, and the Bank of Canada also failed to have much impact,
dealers said.
   The intervention appeared to be fairly light, one dealer said.
   The dollar's recovery was aided by a few large buy orders that
triggered a snowballing rally, a dealer said.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7550 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7680 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.8705 West German marks, up from 1.8505; 1.5890
Swiss francs, up from 1.5755; 6.3800 French francs, up from 6.3085;
2.0925 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0855; 1,356.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,354.00; and 1.1937 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1973.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.20 Japanese yen to a closing 127.90
yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 128.45 yen.
   Gold held steady in London. The late bid price was $402.25 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $402.40, compared with $402.15
bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 21 cents to close at a bid
$404.64.
   Silver bullion rose on the London market to a late bid price of
$5.94 a troy ounce from $5.92 bid late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Upjohn Using Low-Key Approach To Sell Hair Loss Remedy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA PERLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A slightly balding man in his mid 30s
sits on a deserted beach with his golden retriever and ponders
aloud, ``Some things in life are as inevitable as the tide.''
   In a television and magazine ad campaign that began early last
month, Upjohn Co. is taking a low-key approach _ not necessarily by
choice _ to market its hair-loss remedy, Rogaine.
   Results appear mixed: the company says it is pleased with Rogaine
sales but some industry watchers say it's too early to tell if the
drug is a success.
   The marketing approach is so subtle that the ads mention neither
Rogaine nor its active ingredient, minoxidil, although they do name
Upjohn. The U.S. Food and Drug Adminstration, which approved Rogaine
sales last fall, does not allow any mention of drugs in
advertisements unless there also is full disclosure of any warnings
and potential side effects.
   ``Our message is that if you're concerned about hair loss,
there's treatment available and you should see your doctor,'' Upjohn
spokeswoman Kaye Bennett said Tuesday. ``We want to get across that
it's OK to do something about it. There's been a taboo on this kind
of thing for too long.''
   The ads appear in such male-oriented magazines as Gentlemen's
Quarterly, Golf Digest, Sports Illustrated and Road &amp; Track, plus
such mainstream publications as Time, Newsweek, BusinessWeek, People
and USA Today.
   The one television commercial, which features the same actor as
the magazine ad, is appearing on the three major networks and on
independent stations, especially during sporting events.
   Some analysts believe the ads for the first medically-proven hair
restorer are too subtle.
   ``They can't use the name, but the treatment in the ad isn't even
referred to as a drug,'' said Ronald Nordmann, a research analyst
with PaineWebber Inc. in New York. ``Consequently, the viewer
doesn't know if the available treatment is a hair weave, a
transplant, a drug or anything.''
   Kalamazoo-based Upjohn isn't worried about Rogaine's name
recognition among consumers.
   ``The reception our sales force has gotten (from the medical
community) is tremendous,'' said Tim Thieme, product manager for
Rogaine. ``We've gotten a very good reaction to the ads. ...We think
people appreciate the very low-key approach.''
   Upjohn does not release sales figures for individual products,
but Bennett said the company is very pleased with Rogaine's sales.
   Some analysts, however, have been disappointed with Upjohn's
stock performance since the drug was introduced in September.
   ``The product isn't doing very well, but it's too early to tell
whether it'll be successful and how consumers will react to the
advertising,'' Nordmann said. ``The investor is disappointed because
he focused too much attention on Rogaine too early.''
   Upjohn traded at $29.75 a share late Wednesday on the New York
Stock Exchange, below its 52-week high of $35.25.
   At Oakwood Plaza Pharmacy in Kalamazoo, pharmacist Chuck Shane
said Rogaine's sales have risen 25 percent since the advertising
campaign began.
   ``Sales are increasing, but I wouldn't exactly get excited about
it,'' Shane said. ``More people are asking about it than buying it.''
   Minoxidil has been advertised in Canada since 1986. A few of the
other 45 countries in which minoxidil is available have had limited
advertising campaigns, Bennett said.
   Upjohn's U.S. campaign marks a departure from the company's
tradition of advertising only in medical journals.
   ``This is a very unique situation. Being a prescription drug,
we're under some restrictions that a lot of other advertisers aren't
under,'' Thieme said. ``We don't want to over-promise in the ads;
that will only hurt us.''
   One reason for caution is that in testing 2,300 men at 27 medical
centers, Rogaine had only a 39 percent success rate. Upjohn said
those with the best chance of success are men younger than 40 who
have been losing their hair for 10 years or less and who have an
area of baldness four inches in diameter or less on the crown of the
head.
   The target audience for the advertising campaign is men between
the ages of 25 and 44 and those with an annual income of $35,000 or
more, Nordmann said.
   A one-month supply of the drug, which comes in a bottle with
rub-on or spray applicators, retails for about $60. The drug must be
used regularly in order to maintain new hair growth.

   Profound changes are at work in the American
Midwest, sent reeling this decade with blows to its auto, steel and
farming powerhouses. For autos, the Midwest was the place, Detroit
the hub. Chicago and St. Louis also boasted auto plants. Now,
Japanese automakers are setting up shop in rural, largely white
communities and jobs are becoming increasingly scarce for big-city
blacks. The first story in a four-part AP Extra series, ``The
Changing Heartland,'' examines this trend.

   With a college campus and fertile fields,
this patch of mid-America is a place where students learn and
farmers earn side by side. But corn country has a new face producing
a new crop _ cars.
   Last fall, this tranquil town and its twin city, Bloomington,
joined a growing number of smaller Midwest locales with
Japanese-associated plants that are shaking up the auto industry.
   The increasing Japanese presence in America's midsection _ plants
in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Tennessee, one planned for Indiana, and
Chrysler-Mitsubishi here _ is creating work and growth in white
rural areas while jobs and opportunity disappear in heavily minority
big cities.
   ``Certainly, it's a restructuring of the auto industry,'' said
Richard Hill, a Michigan State University urban affairs and
sociology professor. ``The reorganization ... is definitely
detrimental to blacks.''
   The trend has aroused concern in a business that's already lost
thousands of blue-collar jobs, raised questions about potential
bias, and worried blacks, who've long regarded the auto industry as
a steppingstone to a better life.
   ``Auto shops were really the bridge that brought black people
from the lower class to the middle class,'' said Joe Wilson, former
head of a United Auto Workers local at a closed Detroit plant.
``What are you going to do for the people left behind, locked up in
the ghetto who have no place to go and no car to get out to rural
areas?''
   Japanese automakers, who've invested $5 billion in U.S.-based
facilities in the last decade, point to their affirmative action
programs and insist transportation, education and the work ethic _
not race _ determine location. But some academics also claim the
Japanese generally avoid unionized areas and towns with large pools
of U.S. autoworkers, preferring to train novices.
   Whatever the reason, communities such as Bloomington-Normal _
thriving, white-collar towns that are worlds apart from
gasping-for-survival, blue-collar cities like Detroit _ are becoming
motor capitals.
   ``It's just a different culture,'' said Bloomington Mayor Jesse
Smart. ``This whole city is like a big neighborhood. (And) with
modern auto plants being clean, it's not smokestack anymore; it's
compatible with agriculture.''
   In Bloomington-Normal, insurance, farming and academia are big.
Urban blight, crime and unemployment are not.
   Bloomington-Normal, 4 percent minority, had a 4.1 percent
unemployment rate in October. Detroit, 65 percent minority, had a
10.1 percent jobless level.
   Studies have shown black men have been devastated by industrial
decline. In the Detroit area, 52 percent of black men in heavy
manufacturing production lost their jobs from 1979 to 1984,
according to a study by Michigan State's Hill.
   Nationwide, about 27 percent of blacks lost their heavy
manufacturing jobs in the same period, said the study, based on
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reports.
   Future prospects are even bleaker.
   A 1988 study concluded Japanese ``behavior with regard to site
location and hiring practices heightens rather than eases the
dilemma of blacks who are being rapidly displaced from their
traditional American employers.''
   The study, by University of Michigan professors Robert Cole and
Donald Deskins, said although they had no concrete evidence, they
believe ``avoidance of blacks is one factor'' for the Japanese in
determining plant sites.
   ``I think it's a factor,'' Deskins said. ``I can't say this is
their intent.''
   The study found while blacks comprise 11 percent of the civilian
labor force, they represent 17.2 percent of workers at the Big Three
U.S. automakers.
   In contrast, the study said, Mazda Motor Manufacturing (USA)
Corp.'s plant in Flat Rock, Mich., has a potential black labor pool
of 29 percent and Honda of America Manufacturing Inc., in
Marysville, Ohio, has one of 10.5 percent. Company officials say
their black workforce is 15.1 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively.
   Honda spokesman Roger Lambert disagreed with the calculations and
also pointed out the company recruits at black colleges.
   Honda, however, agreed last March to give $6 million to 377
blacks and women after an EEOC investigation concluded they should
have been hired sooner.
   The EEOC claimed Honda employed discriminatory practices with a
30-mile hiring radius that excluded Columbus, Ohio, which has the
area's largest minority population. Honda, which expanded its hiring
area before the settlement, admitted no wrongdoing.
   Many Japanese-associated auto plants are close to universities
and near Interstate 75, dubbed Auto Alley, which stretches south
from Michigan.
   Toyota is in Georgetown, Ky., near the University of Kentucky;
Chrysler-Mitsubishi is in Normal, home of Illinois State University,
while Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc. is near Lafayette, Ind., across
the river from Purdue.
   These towns say automakers are attracted to cheaper land, lower
taxes, open space and a well-educated work force.
   Bloomington-Normal, population 87,718, was appealing because of
its good highway and rail systems, incentives, strong work ethic and
schools, said G. Glenn Gardner, former chairman of Diamond-Star
Motors Corp., the firm formed by Chrysler and Mitsubishi.
   ``We needed people with very good communication skills _ verbal,
written and reading,'' he said. ``Some of the major larger cities
have a very difficult time graduating significant numbers of
students.''
   In Tippecanoe County, surrounding Lafayette, one in four people
25 years and older has four years of college, said Mark Davis,
president of Greater Lafayette Progress Inc., a non-profit
development corporation.
   ``What kind of public education system does Detroit have?'' he
asked. ``What kind of technological capability in terms of college
graduates does Detroit have?
   ``There's no God-given right big cities should be viewed as the
automotive centers,'' he said. ``We small towns, technologically
sophisticated centers, think we can compete, too.''

   They do, engaging in fierce bidding wars, offering free land and
water, road and sewer improvements, employee training funds and tax
abatements.
   Chrysler-Mitsubishi received $88.7 million in state incentives
alone, including 630 acres of farm land.
   ``Nobody ever offered us a site in Chicago ... Detroit ... (or)
St. Louis,'' Gardner said.
   Experts also say Japanese automakers prefer areas where unions
aren't strong.
   ``They're afraid wages will be high,'' said Michael Young,
director of the Center for Japanese Legal Studies at Columbia
University. ``They're afraid unions will create demands that will
make the company unproductive.''
   Mazda is atypical _ it is 25 miles from Detroit and, spokesman
Jim Gill said, the only wholly owned subsidiary of a Japanese
automaker with UAW affiliation.
   ``If you're going to locate in Michigan,'' Gill said, ``you best
be prepared to deal with the UAW.''
   Mazda, because of its location, also has many former Big Three
employees _ nearly a fourth of its workers.
   But Vladmir Pucik, international business professor at the
University of Michigan, said the Japanese prefer ``a relatively
inexperienced labor force so they can train them in the Japanese way
of doing things. They want to go somewhere so nobody will say, `At
Ford, we did it differently.''
   Gardner conceded Chrysler-Mitsubishi sought fresh faces.
   ``We didn't want to have another car plant that (would) have 20
years of experience transferred to our plant,'' he said. ``We wanted
some green people when it comes to building cars.''
   But he said any suggestion race was involved in site selection
was ``utter nonsense'' and any charge ``we selected a town to stay
away from a union ... is absolutely and unequivocally dead wrong.''
   The plant was built with a 100 percent unionized labor force.
   Bloomington Mayor Smart says the Japanese will be happy they
built here.
   ``When you get into any rural setting, people are not afraid to
put in long hours,'' he said. ``Here there's a satisfaction in
seeing the end result. You're just bred that way.''

   Following is a list of Japanese-associated auto plants in the
United States. The information is provided by company officials.
   _ Diamond-Star Motors Corp. in Normal, Ill., a joint
Chrysler-Mitsubishi venture, began producing Plymouth Lasers and
Mitsubishi Eclipses in September.
   The workforce is about 1,500 and could reach 2,900 by this fall.
By 1990, annual production will be 240,000 cars a year.
   _ Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc., next to Lafayette, Ind., a joint
venture of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. and Isuzu Motors Limited, is
expected to begin producing cars and trucks this September.
   The plant will initially employ 1,700 workers and, depending on
the market, could expand to a workforce of 3,200 by 1992-93. By
1990, production of Isuzu Troopers and Pups and the Subaru Legacy
will total 120,000 vehicles a year.
   _ Mazda Motor Manufacturing (USA) Corp. in Flat Rock, Mich.,
began making the Mazda MX-6 and Ford's sporty Probe in September
1987. It has nearly 3,500 employees and produces about 240,000 cars
annually.
   _ Toyota Motor Manufacturing, U.S.A., Inc. in Georgetown, Ky.,
was dedicated in October. It has about 1,750 employees and produces
about 360 Camry sedans a day.
   By the end of 1989, it will produce 200,000 cars annually and
have 3,000 employees. An additional 500 workers will be added when a
power train plant that produces engines, axles and steering
components becomes operational in 1991.
   _ Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. U.S.A. in Smyrna, Tenn.,
opened in June 1983 and has 3,100 workers. The plant produces about
220,000 Sentra cars and Nissan light trucks annually.
   _ Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. in Marysville, Ohio, began
making motorcycles in 1979. Auto production started in 1982. The
company now has two plants at Marysville and one at Anna, Ohio. It
has expanded at Anna and is building a fourth plant in East Liberty,
Ohio. The workforce is 6,700 and expected to increase to 8,500 by
1991. This year, Honda is expected to produce 360,000 Accord and
Civic cars, as well as motorcycles.

   New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., the only Japanese-affiliated
plant located out the country's midsection, opened in Fremont,
Calif., in 1984. The joint Toyota-General Motors venture has 2,640
employees and produces about 200,000 cars a year. It manufactures
the Corolla sedan and the Geo Prizm, a replacement for the Chevy
Nova.

   Here are some facts about the U.S. auto industry, the Japanese
impact on it and black employment within it. The statistics are
provided by the General Accounting Office, the United Auto Workers
union, the Wefa Group, a Michigan State University study by Richard
Hill and Cynthia Negrey, a study by University of Michigan
professors Robert Cole and Donald Deskins Jr., and ``The State of
Black Michigan: 1988,'' a report published by Michigan State and the
Michigan Council of Urban League Executives.

   U.S. Market Share:
   _ Japanese companies increased their share of the U.S. market
from about 8 percent in 1976 to about 23 percent in 1987.
   _ An estimated 2.08 million Japanese imports and 737,513
``transplants'' _ cars built totally or partly by the Japanese at
U.S. sites _ were sold in this country last year. That accounted for
26.6 percent of the 10.52 million cars purchased in the United
States.
   Imports include cars such as the Dodge Colt, built by Mitsubishi
in Japan. Transplants include products of joint U.S.-Japanese
ventures, such as the Ford Probe, built by Mazda.
   _ The number of transplant autos built in the United States has
risen steadily. The Wefa Group, an economic consulting organization,
estimates Japanese transplants in North America will total 1.7
million cars in 1990, compared with 600,000 in 1986.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Imports:
   _ Japan exported 2.21 million cars to the United States in the
1987 fiscal year, which ended last March. The Japanese government
said shipments in the April-November period were 10.4 percent below
those of a year earlier, but it still estimates Japan will have
exported 2.2 million cars to this country when the current fiscal
year ends in March.
   In 1981, Japan imposed a voluntary export restraint in response
to U.S. political pressure. It first limited annual exports to the
United States to 1.68 million units. The cap was increased in steps
to 2.3 million units in 1985. It has remained there since.
   Some Japanese automakers feel the quota is outdated because
domestic car prices have become more attractive against the cost of
Japanese cars, driven upward as the yen doubled in value over the
last three years.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Exports:
   _ In 1986, North America produced 12.5 million vehicles and
exported 40,000. Japan produced 12.2 million vehicles, 6.6 million
of which were exported.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Japanese Investment:
   _ In the 1980s, Japanese automakers have invested $5 billion in
U.S. assembly plants for cars and light trucks.
   _ Seven automakers and more than 100 auto parts suppliers with
partial or total Japanese ownership are operating or building plants
in the United States. Since 1984, the number of Japanese-affiliated
auto suppliers has nearly doubled in this country.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Job Loss:
   _ A 1988 GAO report said Japanese-affiliated automakers could
cause the loss of 45,000 jobs in the industry in 1990 if there was a
high displacement rate (`transplant' autos built in lieu of domestic
cars), a production level of 1.8 million vehicles by those companies
and 50 percent of the cars' parts and materials were made in the
United States compared with 83 percent for traditional U.S.
automakers.
   But the UAW said the government underestimated the potential job
loss due to transplants. The union said up to 74,000 jobs could be
lost.
   _ The GAO estimated a job loss of 360,000 from 1985 to 1990 from
all factors, including transplants, gains in productivity, rising
auto imports and increased use of foreign parts. However, the UAW
estimate was 470,000, noting Japanese-affiliated plants have built
only a third of planned capacity.
   _ From 1985 to 1987, 169,000 auto manufacturing jobs have
disappeared. That includes workers at the plants as well as those
employed by industry suppliers.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Minorities:
   _ In 1984, according to reports filed with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, blacks comprised 17.2 percent of all workers
employed by the Big Three automakers and 8.4 percent of white-collar
employees.
   Blacks make up nearly 11 percent of the civilian labor force.
   _ General Motors Corp. estimated its 1987 payroll for its black
employees was $3 billion. The March 1988 Current Population Survey
estimated total 1987 wage and salary income for 12.9 million blacks
was $178.8 billion.
   So, although GM's black workers represented just six-tenths
percent of all black employees, they received 1.7 percent of the
nation's black wage and salary income in 1987.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Mostly Higher On Rebound, Chinese Wheat Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a technical
rebound from two days of steep losses in the corn and soybean
markets, analysts said.
   Wheat futures rallied strongly late in the session on rumors
China was seeking to buy or had bought 750,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat for delivery this summer.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be true,'' said
Katharina Zimmer, a grain-market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc.
   The rally mainly affected the new-crop wheat contracts, those for
delivery of wheat that has not yet been harvested.
   New-crop corn and soybean futures also posted sharper gains than
the contracts for near-month delivery.
   Analysts said the pattern reflected growing concerns about
potential weather problems that could affect this year's crops.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 6{ higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.39} a bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 6
cents higher with March at $2.70{ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 5
cents higher with March at $2.38 a bushel; soybeans were } cent
lower to 9 cents higher with March at $7.70 a bushel.

<BYLINE>By SHARON COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   They're super-swift high-tech superstars that can do anything
from design nuclear warheads to build a better yacht.
   Supercomputers are used by the government, the military,
universities and Fortune 500 companies to help crack codes, forecast
weather, design aircraft, conduct geological exploration or simulate
the effects of nuclear explosions.
   ``The supercomputer is important economically and socially,''
said Peter Patton, a computer consultant in Minnesota. ``They're
used in everything from the mundane to the sublime _ designing
appliances ... to developing new life-saving techniques and
surgery.''
   That range, he said, can help shape America's role in the world
economy.
   ``The whole name of the game is competitive advantage in the
international market,'' said Patton, director of technology
assessment at the Super Performance Computing Service of Dataquest
Inc., a marketing-forecasting firm. ``The key to maintaining that
competitive advantage is faster design, reduced government
certification time, better testing.''
   The two major U.S. supercomputer companies are Cray Research Inc.
and ETA Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Control Data Corp.
   Its competition: three Japanese computer giants _ Fujitsu,
Hitachi and NEC.
   There also are about three dozen smaller, so-called
``mini-supercomputer'' companies in the United States, Patton said.
   Some experts believe the Japanese are threatening America's
dominance of the industry. ``We opened a very large lead and we no
longer have that large lead,'' Patton said.
   One of Japan's main advantages, he said, is it has the ``lion's
share of semiconductor (computer chips) market. We gave up on the
semiconductor industry.''
   But other experts say it's too early to talk of the Japanese
overtaking the United States.
   ``Even though Cray machines use a lot of Japanese components, I
don't think it's fair to say they're ahead in any way, shape or
form,'' said Michael Burwen, president of Palo Alto Management
Group, a consulting firm.
   ``There are a lot of people who say the Japanese are a very big
threat to supercomputers,'' he said. ``I don't think the evidence is
in. The Japanese certainly have not been able to demonstrate they
can penetrate anything outside their home market in this business.''
   About 350 supercomputers have been installed worldwide. U.S.
customers include NASA, the National Cancer Institute and Los Alamos
National Laboratory, location of the first Cray, introduced in 1976.
   Supercomputers can do billions of calculations a second.
   For example, a Bible concordance _ an alphabetical referencing by
word _ that took a scholar 17 years to do in the mid-1700s and
required 1,000 hours on a computer in 1956 can be done on a Cray
supercomputer in 20 seconds, Patton said.
   Although experts sometimes disagree on what a supercomputer is,
it generally is described as the fastest, largest, most expensive
machine at any time _ one that can do problems others can't.
   Burwen also said 44 percent of all supercomputers are in private
industry, 37 percent in government installations, and 19 percent in
universities.
   Nowadays, supercomputers are changing industry, because products
``can not only be designed and prototyped on screen, but be tested
and evaluated ... and have complete data performance before you
touch tool to steel,'' he said.
   Automakers, for one, ``can do a design in six months instead of
18 months,'' he said. ``You can literally take years off the design
cycle.''
   Supercomputers have also begun to simulate crash testing for
autos.
   And oil companies use supercomputers to get the best production
in petroleum exploration.
   ``If they get 1 percent (more oil) out of a reservoir, it pays
for itself 100 times over,'' Patton said. ``What if it's a $10
million computer if you get $20 billion (more oil) out of a
reservoir?''
   Among Cray's customers are America's Big Three automakers,
Volkswagen, Fiat and petroleum giants such as Shell and Chevron.
   A Cray supercomputer also was used to help design Stars &amp;
Stripes, the yacht Dennis Conner sailed in 1987 when he won the
America's Cup. Two competing syndicates also used Cray technology,
said company spokesman John Swenson.
   Scientists designing supercomputers are toiling in an industry
constantly trying to produce faster machines.
   Cray plans to have a new supercomputer ready this year or next,
and it's expected to be 100 times faster than his original machine.
In 1992-94, he hopes to produce the Cray-4, 1,000 times more
powerful.
   And, Swenson said, that won't be the end. As he explained, ``We
still don't see the limit.''

<HEAD>Part III: Rust Belt City on the Mend _ And Moving Beyond Steel</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Indiana shoreline of Lake Michigan is home to
the nation's steel giants. And perhaps no Rust Belt city better
typifies a steel town than Gary. The steel slump of the '80s hit
hard in Gary, already struggling with crime, decay and a declining
tax base. But steel is making a comeback and Gary hopes it can, too.
The third story of a four-part series, ``The Changing Heartland,''
looks at the resurgence in Gary and northwestern Indiana.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>By SHARON COHEN</NOTE>
<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GARY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This steel town has long been a four-letter
word for all that's gone wrong in industrial America: a shrinking
workforce, sooty skies, a sorry future.
   With the city's fate tied to steel's fortunes, when the industry
hurts, so does Gary. Now that steel is surging, this archetypal Rust
Belt city says it is on the mend, too.
   Unemployment is down, companies are moving in, real estate is
being snatched up. More importantly, Gary is looking beyond steel _
a lakefront marina is planned and an airport project is being pushed.
   ``We're on an upturn now,'' said Mayor Thomas Barnes. ``The
optimism we feel is not because we've resolved the problems that
exist. It's because we're right now on a track to resolving them.
There's growth as opposed to further decline. People are taking
another look at Gary.''
   They will still find a depressed city _ shuttered stores, gutted
homes and a bleak downtown with no hotel or department store. But
there also is new prosperity due, in part, to a leaner, profitable
steel industry that's been boosted by increasing demand, import
limits, the low dollar and new technology.
   After losses of almost $12 billion in 1982-86, the industry
nationwide earned $1 billion in 1987 and is expected to double that
for 1988.
   That improvement has contributed to an upturn in Gary and other
parts of northwestern Indiana, site of the world's greatest
concentration of steel-making capacity. For example:
   _ Five steel companies in Porter and Lake counties, the latter
including Gary, have spent more than $2.5 billion on their
facilities since 1982, said the Indiana Steel Advisory Commission.
   Indiana is America's No. 1 steel producer; 22 percent of the
nation's steel is made there. The industry pumps almost $20 million
daily into Indiana's economy.
   _ Unemployment in the Gary-Hammond, Ind., area fell from 15.7
percent in 1982-83 to 9.5 percent in 1987; the 1987 numbers would
have been lower but for a six-month walkout at USS Gary Works, the
city's biggest employer and flagship of USX Corp.
   November's unemployment rate was 6.1 percent; 1988 was the first
year this decade without double-digit employment in any month. Those
figures, however, do not reflect huge population losses. The area's
labor force shrunk by 38,100 from 1980 to November 1988.
   _ New and expanding businesses in the Gary area have filled 12.4
million square feet of industrial space and created almost 6,500
jobs since 1984. Much of the growth is steel-related.
   Gary ``is one of the best heavy industrial locations in
America,'' said John Gates, an investor and redeveloper. ``You're
close to all the major manufacturers in the United States. Most of
these peoples' customers are nearby. You've got very inexpensive
rents and real estate costs.
   ``If someone needs steel, you're going to be near the biggest and
cheapest source of supply nationwide,'' added Gates, who has helped
24 companies, some from West Germany and Austria, expand or settle
in the area.
   The new-and-improved status may even be reflected in a 1988 Money
magazine survey that ranked the Gary-Hammond area 41st among 300
U.S. living spots _ two slots above considerably more picturesque
Honolulu and up from 92nd place a year earlier.
   That might seem surprising, considering Gary's reputation as
aging, crime-infested and polluted. City planner Taghi Arshami says
that's more myth than reality, though he concedes Gary's center
section, with a vacancy rate equal to 20 acres, is devastated.
   ``The problem we have generally for downtown is lack of
investment, lack of confidence on the part of business and on the
part of banks that are not willing to put the money down,'' he said.
   But he is optimistic about developing Gary's downtown into a
public and service sector hub, noting that 12,000 people work there.
   Some of Gary's image problems stem from lean times of the last
decade. Jobs and people disappeared, unemployment soared. Gary's
population, now about 137,000, fell 10 percent from 1980 to 1986.
Even now, experts say, growth in northwestern Indiana is occurring
in rural areas.
   The mills shrank, too, while becoming more efficient.
Northwestern Indiana now has 35,300 steelworkers, a 47 percent drop
from 1979. USS Gary Works has 7,500 workers, compared with
21,000-22,000 in the late 1970s.
   Although mill investments spur related business, some say Gary is
in a precarious position because it remains so dependent on steel.
   ``The danger of Gary is not that they aren't doing fairly well,''
said Frank Cassell, professor emeritus of industrial relations at
Northwestern University. ``(But) they're likely to delude themselves
into thinking that what they're doing is the most powerful
influence.''
   Instead, he said, bigger factors are external _ demand, the
dollar and the nation's economy. ``Gary is doing good work for
itself. That's commendable,'' he said. ``(But) one doesn't want to
think that's the whole picture.''
   Some business leaders concede the region has done a poor job of
diversifying, but others point to such changes as the growth of the
health industry, which provides 20,400 jobs in the area.
   Gary is also touting recreation. Promotional brochures feature
the Indiana Dunes and Lake Michigan, photos of children bicycling
along the beach, a golden sunset over shimmering waters and a local
boy who made good _ Michael Jackson.
   ``We have one of the largest fresh water bodies anywhere in the
world,'' Barnes said. ``We have far from taken full advantage of
it.''
   Gary hopes to rectify that with an ambitious $150-$200 million,
1,400-slip marina adjacent to the USS site that could eventually
include a hotel, shopping center and amphitheater. Officials hope to
build the first 250 slips this year.
   Gary also hopes to have the third commercial airport in the
Chicago area. Its present airport provides only charter and private
corporate service.
   An expanded airport would relieve congestion at O'Hare
International and Midway in Chicago. One report said it would
attract 6.5 million passengers to Gary annually and create 122,000
jobs with a payroll of $1.6 billion.
   Though these projects are critical, Barnes said the city also has
``a much healthier manner of looking at problems,'' whether it's
cleaning up illegal dumps or addressing housing needs.
   ``There's already a renewed spirit of cooperation that hasn't
existed in 20 years,'' said Bill Brown, transportation planner for
the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission.
   ``People,'' he said, ``feel a lot more confident about Gary's
future.''

   Here are some facts about the steel industry, provided by the
American Iron and Steel Institute. They represent reports from 25
companies representing 80 percent of the industry.
   _ Profits-Losses: The nation's steel industry is expected to post
a 1988 profit of about $2 billion. In 1987, profits were $1.02
billion, following losses of almost $12 billion in 1982-86.
   The rising profits are attributed to a general strengthening in
the world steel market and a moderate increase in demand.
   _ Shipments: Domestic steel mill shipments are estimated to have
risen from 76.7 million tons in 1987 to about 83 million tons in
1988 _ an 8.2 percent increase.
   _ Production: Raw steel production jumped from 89.2 million tons
in 1987 to almost 100 million tons in 1988 _ a 12 percent increase.
   _ Employment: Average industry employment in 1988 was 170,000,
slightly above the 1987 average of 163,000, the lowest since the
institute started keeping records in 1933. The industry posted a
record-high employment of 650,200 in 1953.
   _ Imports: Imports in 1988 will have accounted for about 20.5
percent of the steel shipped to consumers, compared with 20.9
percent in 1987. Imports reached a high of 26.4 percent in 1984, the
year when the Voluntary Restraint Agreements set a goal of reducing
imports to 20.2 percent of the U.S. market. The agreement expires
this year.
   _ State Production: Indiana leads the nation in steel production,
with about 22 percent of the steel made there. Ohio accounts for 18
percent and Pennsylvania 13 percent.

   The stock market pushed ahead toward new
post-crash highs today, shrugging off what analysts described as
mildly disappointing news on international trade.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.75 to 2,228.39 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street. The average reached its highest close since
October 1987 at 2,226.07 last Friday.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 935 up, 513 down and
497 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit widened to $12.51 billion in November from a revised
$10.26 billion the month before.
   The latest number exceeded most advance estimates on Wall Street,
although analysts said it caused no great dismay among traders.
   The news had only a short-lived impact on the markets. The dollar
and bond prices quickly rebounded from it, and as they moved higher
stocks followed their lead.
   Meanwhile, the market also absorbed the news of quarterly
earnings from International Business Machines Corp. that fell
slightly short of expectations.
   IBM, which posted profits of $3.97 a share for the fourth quarter
against $3.47 in the like period a year earlier, was down [ at 123}.
   Tandem Computers jumped 1{ to 18[ and led the active list. The
company reported earnings for its first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31
of 32 cents a share, up from 24 cents in the like period a year
earlier.
   RJR Nabisco slipped [ to 95[ in active trading. Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. said it had lined up more than $14 billion in bank
loans to help finance its buyout of the company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.99 to 160.47. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .59 at 317.16.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 147.87 million shares with an
hour to go.

   When the farm crisis of the '80s swept
mid-America, it took a heavy toll on Iowa: folks lost their land,
Main Streets collapsed and young people deserted their hometowns.
Today, however, despite 1988's withering drought, Iowa's fortunes
are reversing. The final story in a four-part series, ``The Changing
Heartland,'' looks at the upturn in Iowa's economy.

<TEXT>
   When Dennis Keitel returned from a
life abroad two years ago, he yearned to settle on the soil he once
called home. He was ready for Iowa, but Iowa wasn't ready for him.
   Jobs were scarce. So was optimism. People were moving out,
merchants were following. But over time, misery has given way to
mending.
   Iowa, a state that once typified the decline and despair of rural
America, is on the rebound. Consider Keitel, an Iowa native who
returned to a state thousands fled, found work where two years ago
there was none, and is praising a land that not long ago was pitied.
   ``I think this place is a gold mine,'' says Keitel, a 36-year-old
engineer who grew up on an eastern Iowa farm.
   ``The Iowa economy is coming on strong,'' boasts Gov. Terry
Branstad. ``We know we still have a long way to go, but we've come a
long ways.''
   Unemployment is down, revenues are up and there's a sense the
worst is over. Some claim a bust-to-boom assessment is too rosy and
premature, but the declining dollar, export opportunities, price
supports and a diversifying economy have contributed to a
turnaround. Consider:
   _ The value of Iowa farmland rose 20.4 percent in 1988, prompting
the Des Moines Register headline ``Iowa Dirt Turns to Gold Again.''
The increase, reported in an Iowa State University study, was the
largest since the mid-1970s. From 1981 to 1986, land values had
plummeted 63 percent.
   _ Iowa's labor force reached an all-time high in October: 1.5
million people working or seeking jobs. Unemployment was 3.5
percent, the lowest since November 1979. In some areas, jobs
outnumber residents. Mount Pleasant has about 5,000 people of
working age but almost 12,000 jobs.
   Iowa soon plans to set up a nationwide toll-free number to lure
back ex-Iowans who left in search of work.
   _ Iowa is expected to have a $180 million budget surplus in the
1989 and 1990 fiscal years, a panel of financial experts said in
December, although some of that will likely be eaten up with federal
mandates.
   _ One in five Iowa farmers has substantial money troubles, down
from one in three in 1984-85, said Neil Harl, an Iowa State
economics professor.
   _ Deere &amp; Co., the state's largest private employer with 14,800
workers, posted record fourth-quarter and year-end earnings.
   _ After six years in which Iowa lost almost 100,000 people, the
Census Bureau reported last month state population increased by
11,000 from 1987 to 1988.
   Despite such numbers, some say last summer's drought will have a
lingering impact. They also worry the state's upturn is bypassing
rural areas where schools have closed, young people have departed
and Main Street merchants have closed up shop.
   ``We haven't turned the corner yet by any means,'' said Dave
Ostendorf of Prairiefire, a rural advocacy group. ``Many of the
rural counties still have poverty rates exceeding 20 percent.''
   Branstad says, though, that no state enjoys ``uniform prosperity.
What we want to do is help those areas that aren't doing as well to
help themselves.''
   The state uses lottery proceeds, for instance, for economic
development, some of the money going for loans, aid to local
communities or research projects.
   Already, the upswing and growth in the meat packing and farm
equipment industries have helped hard-hit blue-collar areas. In
Waterloo, unemployment fell from 8.8 percent last January to 4.3
percent in November.
   ``People feel we've bottomed out,'' said Jim Lawrence, president
of the Waterloo Chamber of Commerce.
   Deere, which has a giant local operation, has recalled workers; a
leather processing plant recently opened, and a new IBP Inc. hog
slaughtering plant is being built, Lawrence said.
   In Mason City, about 1,500 new jobs, many of them service sector
and health-related, will be created in 1989 alone, compared with
about 2,000 in the last five years combined, said Tom Jolas, an
economic development consultant to the city.
   Iowa's recovery is due, in part, to a declining dollar that makes
grain and other products more competitive on the world market, said
state economist Harvey Siegelman.
   ``There will be Winnebagos going to Europe, beef to Japan and
Deere tractors all over the world,'' he said.
   Just as critical is Iowa's effort to reduce its reliance on
agriculture.
   ``The key to success is diversification,'' Branstad said. ``Some
of it actually is building off the agricultural economy that already
exists and finding new uses for products.''
   Branstad said Iowa has also targeted several industries for
development: telecommunications, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and
insurance. Des Moines already is an insurance capital.
   Mount Pleasant, 28 miles from the Mississippi River, learned to
diversify decades ago. It's paid off. The town's business roster
includes such corporate names as Motorola, Cargill and Goodyear. A
Wal-Mart distribution center opened in 1985.
   Mount Pleasant is also home to a large fireplace maker, a bulk
mail distributor that claims more outgoing postage volume than Las
Vegas, and a school bus manufacturer.
   ``We set an example of how we can control our own future,'' said
Glenda Griffin, the local chamber's vice president. ``We appreciate
the help of the state and federal government, but we will not sit
back and depend on them.''
   Mount Pleasant never hit the depths some Iowa communities sank to
in the mid-1980s, though the county unemployment rate was 8.1
percent in 1982-83. In November, it was 2.5 percent.
   In the last six months, two motels, four stores and a truck stop
have opened. Officials say property values rose from $45 million to
$130 million in the last decade; retail sales jumped 18.7 percent
from March 1986 to March 1988.
   Mount Pleasant has also held onto its young people, offering jobs
involving computers and lasers.
   ``There isn't a small town in the state of Iowa that has any more
sophisticated industry than we have,'' said Mayor Tom Vilsack.
   Keitel returned from Saudia Arabia in 1986, ending up as an
engineer in Connecticut when he couldn't find work in Iowa. Last
fall he found a job in Mount Pleasant.
   ``Iowa still has a lot to offer, even with all of its problems,''
he said. ``We haven't lost our sense of values. The quality of life
still means more than the almighty dollar.''
   Vilsack has another explanation:
   ``We can't do a lot about what's plaguing the small-town farmer.
We've given families the opportunity to be in control of their own
lives. Iowa's got to take its destiny in its own hands.''

   Unisys Corp. introduced what it called ``the
industry's first true desktop mainframe,'' a personal computer that
has a special circuit board with all the features of its big
mainframe computers.
   The Micro A further blurs the distinction between personal
computers and mainframes, which were once as different as
motorcycles and buses. It can can run either standard personal
computer programs or programs written for its big A series of
mainframes, Unisys said.
   Unisys used advanced chip-packing techniques to get mainframe
features onto a board small enough to fit into a single slot in one
of its standard PW2 personal computers.
   The Micro A should help Unisys against competitors such as
International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp.,
which are also emphasizing their ability to run the same programs on
big and small computers, analysts said.
   ``I think they've got something real here,'' said Wendy
Abramowitz, an analyst for Argus Research Corp. But she said Unisys'
A series would still have trouble competing with the likes of IBM's
new AS-400 line because there are fewer programs available for it.
   ``It's a positive but it's not a cure-all,'' she said.

<HEAD>Survey Says 17 Percent of Biggest US Firms Wooed by Foreigners in
1988</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign firms made takeover overtures to 17
percent of the largest U.S. companies last year but only a handful
of the approaches grew into a formal buyout bid, according to a
survey released Wednesday.
   The survey by Northwestern University's Kellogg Graduate School
of Management also found that about two-thirds of the 95 chief
executives who participated said they were more interested in joint
ventures with foreign companies than they were in selling out.
   The findings were based on a survey of the chief executive
officers of 95 U.S. corporations with annual sales of at least $1
billion.
   Northwestern Professor Edward Zajac, project director for the
survey, said he was surprised by the number of firms that reported
overtures by foreign companies.
   ``Look at our sample _ those firms are very large,'' Zajac said
in a telephone interview from his office in Evanston. ``To say that
17 percent of Fortune 500 and Forbes 500 companies have been
approached, that's a healthy number.''
   But Ian Dunn, managing director of Samuel Montagu Inc., the New
York-based investment-banking unit of Britain's Midland Bank PLC,
was unimpressed with the survey results.
   ``It surprises me that it's as low as it is,'' Dunn said, citing
the takeovers by British firms last year of such notable U.S.
companies as Pillsbury Co., Farmers Group Inc. and Macmillan Inc.
   ``It doesn't surprise me at all that 17 of the 95 had been
contacted,'' said Dunn, whose firm assisted in Maxwell Communication
Corp.'s buyout of Macmillan.
   Twenty-three percent of the survey respondents said they had been
approached about a prospective buyout by a domestic company.
   The survey did not attempt to identify the nationalities of the
foreign companies that made takeover overtures for U.S. firms.
   But a report released Tuesday by the Translink International
Group, an investment banking firm, said British companies went on a
record $32.5 billion spending spree in America last year, buying 398
U.S. companies.
   Japanese companies spent $12.7 billion on U.S. acquisitions in
1988, according to the quarterly British-American Deal Review, which
is published by Translink.
   The Northwestern survey also found that while 60 percent of the
respondents felt foreign ownership tends to maximize shareholder
value, just over half said they would prefer a U.S. firm as a new
owner if they were taken over.
   Only 5.7 percent of the CEOs expressed a preference for foreign
ownership.
   Sixty-four percent of the companies surveyed said they were
involved with foreign allies in ``strategic alliances'' that ranged
from joint ventures and licensing agreements to co-marketing
agreements.
   ``I think that really shows how firms are adjusting to the new
global economy,'' Zajac said.

   Combustion Engineering Inc. and
Paris-based Alsthom SA announced plans Wednesday to combine their
steam-boiler businesses in a joint venture that would have combined
revenues of about $2 billion.
   Combustion Engineering and Alsthom would own roughly equal shares
in the joint venture, which is subject to approval by each company's
board of directors and regulatory agencies in the United States,
France, Canada and the European Common Market.
   Talks leading to a definitive agreement are expected to take
several months, the companies said in a joint statement.
   The fossil-fueled steam boilers are used by electric utilities
and industrial users for generating power.
   ``Alsthom has been a licensee of C-E's steam generating
technology for 40 years and is an important supplier in the European
community and elsewhere,'' Charles E. Hugel, Combustion's chairman
and chief executive, said in a statement. ``We have great respect
for their capability.''
   Alsthom said its equity in the venture will be transferred to a
new joint venture company recently announced with General Electric
Co. of Great Britain.
   Combustion Engineering, which had net income of $56.6 million on
sales of $3 billion in 1987, provides engineering products, services
and systems to power-generating customers worldwide.
   Alsthom, which had sales of $4.7 billion in 1987, is a leading
manufacturer of industrial products and services concentrated in
energy, mass transportation and ship building, and a leading
supplier of power generation equipment, services and plants.

<HEAD>SEC Wants Drexel's Junk Bond Operation Moved to New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment
powerhouse that has agreed to plead guilty to fraud, is grappling
with a potentially crippling government demand to transplant its
lucrative and freewheeling high-yield ``junk bond'' operation from
California to New York.
   Sources familiar with negotiations between Drexel and federal
authorities, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed reports
Wednesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission has added that
condition as a basis for settling outstanding civil litigation
against Drexel.
   Making peace with the SEC is crucial for finalizing Drexel's
record plea bargain deal reached last month with the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office on related criminal charges.
   Under that arrangement, the firm agreed to plead guilty to six
felonies and pay $650 million in fines and restitution, largely
stemming from its dealings with Ivan F. Boesky, the inside trader
now serving a three-year prison term.
   A deadline for Drexel to settle with the SEC passed a week ago,
but the sources said both sides informally agreed to stop the clock
in order to complete their negotiations.
   It was unclear why the SEC added the new condition regarding
Drexel's junk bond unit, a highly autonomous operation based in
Beverly Hills, Calif. The SEC reportedly had asked earlier that only
supervisory authority over the operation be transferred to Drexel's
New York headquarters.
   The junk bond unit is said to be the major source of profit for
the nation's fifth-biggest securities firm.
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue declined to comment on the Drexel
negotiations, in accordance with the commission's policy regarding
impending enforcement matters. Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder also
declined to comment on the negotiations but suggested a relocation
of the junk bond unit could be ruinous.
   Anreder said the firm ``does not believe the high-yield bond
department can be successfully moved to New York since any effort to
do so would destroy the department and do irreparable damage to the
high-yield market.''
   Despite its lengthy legal ordeal stemming from the Boesky
scandal, Drexel remains a leader in selling and dealing junk bonds,
which are low-grade, high-interest securities used mainly to finance
takeovers and the growth of small and medium size companies. Drexel
helped parlay junk bonds into a $175 billion market.
   The new SEC demand came at a time when many Drexel high-yield
bond traders already are upset over the firm's decision to bargain
with the government rather than fight fraud accusations that stemmed
from Boesky's disclosures when he was exposed in late 1986.
   Drexel chief executive Frederick Joseph visited the operation
last week in attempt to ease tension there. But if Drexel were
forced to relocate the junk bond unit to New York, many disaffected
traders might quit, throwing the business into chaos.
   The operation was moved from New York to California in 1978 by
its architect Michael Milken, a senior Drexel financier who is
expected to be indicted on securities fraud and other charges.
   Unlike Drexel, Milken has continued asserting his innocence but
has been under intensifying pressure to negotiate a plea bargain.

   The stock market swept ahead to new post-crash
highs today, shrugging off what analysts described as mildly
disappointing news on international trade.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit widened to $12.51 billion in November from a revised
$10.26 billion the month before.
   The latest number exceeded most advance estimates on Wall Street,
although analysts said it caused no great dismay among traders.
   The news had only a short-lived impact on the markets. The dollar
and bond prices quickly rebounded from it, and as they moved higher
stocks followed their lead.
   Meanwhile, the market also absorbed the news of quarterly
earnings from International Business Machines Corp. that fell
slightly short of expectations.

   William Dillard, the founder and chairman of
Dillard Department Stores Inc., was honored Wednesday by a retailing
industry group for his 50 years in the business.
   The National Retail Merchants Association gave Dillard its gold
medal for achievement at a luncheon that closed the NRMA's annual
convention here.
   Dillard, 74, who opened his first store in 1938, is known as an
innovative retailer, and industry watchers consider his stores
standouts among department stores. His chain now includes 146
Dillard stores, as well as 12 Higbee stores he owns in conjunction
with shopping mall developer Edward DeBartolo.
   The Dillard stores, located primarily in the Midwest and
Southwest, rang up an estimated $2.5 billion in sales last year.
   Dillard was born in Mineral Springs, Ark. and received business
degrees from the University of Arkansas and Columbia University.
After working for Sears, Roebuck and Co. for eight months, he opened
his first store in Nashville, Ark.
   Dillard Department Stores is headquartered in Little Rock, Ark.

<HEAD>EPA Still Hopes To Move On Gas Vapor Pollution Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Wednesday it still hoped to move further before the end of the
Reagan administration toward a regulation requiring larger gasoline
vapor recovery canisters on cars.
   The agency's proposed regulation, and a companion rule requring
refiners to lower the volatility of gasoline, has been held up by
the Office of Management and Budget since October on safety grounds.
   A trade publication, Inside EPA, reported last week that C.
Boyden Gray, counsel to President-elect Bush, had asked Lee M.
Thomas, EPA administrator, to take no action on the canister rule
but to adopt the volatility rule.
   ``We are still hopeful that some type of agreement can be made
that would allow us to take the next step procedurally,'' EPA
spokesman Dave Cohen said Wednesday.
   Gasoline vapors are a principal source of urban smog, and the
trend in recent years toward higher volatility gasoline has
increased vapor emissions over EPA expectations. Several
northeastern states recently adopted regulations of their own
requiring refiners to lower volatility.
   Existing small canisters on cars are designed to recover vapors
only while the car is running or parked, not the large amounts
emitted during refueling. Recent EPA research has shown the
higher-volatility fuel used today can overhelm the capacity of
current canisters when running in hot weather.
   EPA estimates its canister and volatility rules together would
reduce emissions of ozone-forming compounds by up to 30 percent in
some areas.
   The Office of Management and Budget, the auto industry and Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee and a staunch guardian of the auto industry's interests,
all have objected that EPA's plan would increase the fire risk in
crashes.
   A report from the National Highway and Traffic Safety
Administration said unresolved safety questions remain; EPA's
consultants have said the risk would be reduced.
   When it published the draft canister rule for public comment, EPA
acknowledged it would have to seek public comment again on the NHTSA
report.
   In his comment Wednesday, Cohen was referring to that second
solicitation of comment. That would not require the agency to go
ahead with the volatility standard alone.
   Thomas' successor, William Reilly, has expressed no opinion on
the issue. He could revoke any action Thomas took, but such
revocations are bureaucratically as complicated as the issuance of a
new regulation.
   Thomas has been convinced for more than a year that the gasoline
volatility rule, opposed by the oil industry, and the canister rule,
favored by the oil industry, must be adopted together to keep the
industry mollified if not satisfied.
   If the canister rule is not adopted, there is a risk that the
entire issue of gasoline vapor emissions during refueling would be
thrown back to where it was when it started 10 years ago, pitting
the oil and auto industries against each other.
   The alternative to a canister rule is a requirement for
vapor-recovering hoses at service stations, already used in the
District of Columbia and parts of California and coming into use in
parts of New Jersey and the St. Louis area. The oil industry opposes
these because it costs several thousand dollars to eequip each
stations.
   Thomas believes the larger canister on the car is the better way
to reduce vapors because monitoring compliance among two dozen or so
manufacturers and importers on the device is easier than checking
tens of thousands of gasoline stations using the dual-hose systems.

   Car thieves love Camaros.
   The autos made by General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet Division were
the four most-stolen cars last year, according to a list compiled by
an automobile valuation service in Chicago.
   In fact, thieves picked GM cars as their 22 most-popular targets,
according to the list developed by CCC Information Services Inc., a
business used by insurance companies to determine the value of a
stolen car.
   The 1986 Chevrolet Camaro topped the CCC list of stolen cars for
the second consecutive year.
   This year's list, based on 1988 car thefts, has the '87 Camaro as
No. 2; the '84 Camaro following that, and the '85 Camaro as No. 4.
   The top five was rounded out by the 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass
Supreme.
   ``It (the Camaro) appears as popular with thieves as with lawful
owners,'' said Ralph Kramer, a spokesman for the Chevrolet Division.
``That car is extremely popular and if you think of a huge
percentage of auto thefts being joy-ride kinds of things, the people
who tend to go joy riding tend to do so in Camaros.''
   The most popular imported car among thieves last year was the
1987 Hyundai Excel, made in South Korea. It was followed on the
import list by the 1985 Mazda RX7 GT, and the '83, '81 and '82
Toyota Corolla, all made in Japan.
   Of the 111,440 nationwide insurance claims handled by CCC, there
were reports of 1,006 thefts of '86 Camaros, making up 0.9 percent
of all the stolen cars. There were 780 thefts of '87 Camaros; 748
thefts of '84 Camaros and 673 thefts of '85 Camaros.
   The '87 Hyundai Excel wound up No. 23 on the overall list,
following nearly two dozen GM cars. Automobiles made by GM accounted
for 76 of the top 100, Ford Motor Co. had four cars on the list,
Chrysler Corp. had none and imported brands had 20.
   The first non-GM, U.S.-made car on the list is the 1985 Ford
Escort, holding down spot No. 45.
   GM cars make up about 50 percent of those on the road today, said
company spokesman Dave Hudgens.
   Kramer said the company has taken note of the high theft rate of
some of its cars and is fighting it. ``I think the VATS system is
going to make it a whole lot more difficult to steal a car,'' he
said.
   VATS, for vehicle anti-theft system, was introduced on the
Corvette and now is being used on Camaros and Firebirds, Kramer said.
   CCC provides an information database for insurance companies to
settle theft and collision claims. CCC said the insurance companies
with which it deals with represent 75 percent of all automobile
property and casualty insurance in force.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Narrows in 1988, But Was Widening in Recent
Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan said Wednesday its surplus of exports over
imports surged in December to a monthly record, despite official
assurances that the Asian economic giant is moving forcefully to
open markets to foreign goods.
   Although the Finance Ministry said the surplus shrank for all of
1988, figures showed it was widening in the last four months of the
year, capped by the $9.65 billion imbalance recorded last month.
   The Finance Ministry's announcement coincided with news from
Washington that the trade deficit of the United States, Japan's most
important trading partner, ballooned to $12.5 billion in November,
the biggest imbalance in five months.
   Taken together, the figures suggested that simmering
U.S.-Japanese disputes could worsen over restricted American access
to Japan's markets, and Japan's exploitation of the American
marketplace.
   For all of 1988, the Finance Ministry reported, the surplus
totaled $77.39 billion, down from $79.71 billion in 1987.
   But the figure was overshadowed by the December surplus, which
compared with an $8.61 billion surplus a year earlier and $6.56
billion surplus in November. It was the fourth straight month that
Japan's surplus exceeded that of the corresponding month in 1987.
   ``We hear the voices of concern, and we have concern,'' Mitoji
Yabunaka, director of the Foreign Ministry's Second North America
Division, said at a news conference. ``But at the same time, we see
encouraging trends.''
   Japan's major trading partners have been pressing it for years to
take greater steps toward reducing its huge trade surpluses by
opening Japanese markets to greater competition from abroad.
   The Finance Ministry said exports totaled $264.87 billion in
1988, up 15.6 percent from the previous year, while imports climbed
25.4 percent to $187.47 billion.
   Japan's December exports grew 11.6 percent from a year earlier to
$26.08 billion while imports grew 11.3 percent to $16.43 billion.
   With the United States, Japan's 1988 surplus totaled $47.61
billion, down from $52.10 billion in 1987. But the December surplus
with the United States totaled $5.03 billion, up from $4.92 billion
in the previous December.
   Lower prices for crude oil, Japan's most important import,
coupled with strong demand overseas for Japanese-made computers,
semiconductors and automobiles contributed to the record December
figure.
   Japan ran a $22.8 billion surplus with the European Economic
Community in 1988, up from $20.02 billion in 1987. In December, the
surplus totaled $2.15 billion, up from $1.92 billion a year earlier.
   For fiscal 1988, which ends March 31, Yabunaka stressed that the
projected 23.4 percent increase in imports is better than initially
expected and shows Japan is ``on the right track.''
   In fiscal 1989, the government sees imports growing by 17.4
percent compared with 9.4 percent for exports.
   Yabunaka attributed the 13.5 percent growth in fiscal 1988
exports to the strong world economic performance in general, and
added: ``There will be a moderate growth in exports over the course
of the next (fiscal) year, but we expect the speed to slow down due
to a slowing in the world economy.''

   International Business Machines Corp. said Wednesday its
quarterly earnings rose 12.4 percent, a gain that appeared to
reflect the improving health of the computer industry in general.
   Some analysts predicted that in 1989 IBM would approach and maybe
surpass its record profits of 1984, the year before a computer
industry slump that produced the first back-to-back earnings
declines in IBM history.
   ``'87 and '88 were kind of recovery years. Maybe '89 is when
we're going to break the all-time records,'' said Stephen Cohen, an
analyst at SoundView Financial Group in Stamford, Conn., who is
bullish on IBM stock.
   Makers of big mainframe computers and engineering workstations
are generally doing well while personal computer makers are muddling
along, although results for individual companies vary widely.
   Tandy Corp., a personal computer maker, reported a narrow 3
percent gain in profit Wednesday. Wang Laboratories Inc., a
minicomputer maker that has struggled in recent years, said its
earnings tumbled 97 percent.
   IBM, the world's largest computer company, said its profits were
helped by increased efficiency and positive response by customers
``in every segment of our business.''
   The Armonk, N.Y.-based company also announced it had trimmed its
staff even more than expected through voluntary separation
incentives.
   The company's stock rose $1.12{ to $125 a share in consolidated
New York Stock Exchange trading. It had dropped as much as $1.75 a
share right after the announcement but soon recovered.
   The pressure on IBM's stock came mainly from the company's
statements to analysts that its tax rate in 1989 would be higher
than in 1988, depressing net income, Cohen and others said.
   IBM said it earned $2.35 billion, or $3.97 a share, up from $2.09
billion, or $3.47 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $20
billion from $18.3 billion in the 1987 period.
   For all of 1988, IBM said its earnings rose 10.4 percent to $5.81
billion, or $9.80 a share, from $5.26 billion, or $8.72 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent to $59.7 billion from $55.3
billion.
   IBM said it recorded a fourth-quarter gain of $220 million on
payments from Fujitsu Ltd., its Japanese rival, under an arbitration
order that ended a software copyright dispute.
   But that gain was more than offset by a charge of $270 million to
cover unexpected costs of consolidating its operations.
   The company said 6,500 employees had chosen to leave the company
under a voluntary separation incentive program, more than the 3,000
to 4,000 that the company had expected when it announced the
incentives in June as part of a $600 million consolidation program.
   The separation offer was made to some manufacturing and
headquarters employees. IBM spokeswoman Marti Mattia said it had
been especially popular with heaquarters employees.
   Jay Stevens, an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said of
IBM's results, ``It was a good quarter.''
   ``Some hot money moved in to anticipate a better-than-expected
quarter'' and moved out when the hopes failed to materialize, he
said, explaining the stock drop.
   ``The IBM company is continuing to show improvement in our
product line, our relationships with our customers and our financial
performance,'' John F. Akers, IBM's chairman and chief executive,
said in a statement.
   Wang Laboratories, based in Lowell, Mass., said its earnings fell
to $1 million, or 1 cent per share, in its second fiscal quarter,
from $34.1 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. The
office-automation company said revenue fell to $760.7 million from
$784.7 million a year earlier.
   Wang said its earnings for the six months ended Dec. 31 were
$14.1 million, or 9 cents a share, down from $56.6 million, or 34
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $1.483 billion
from $1.477 billion a year earlier.
   Tandy, based in Fort Worth, Texas, said its second-quarter
earnings rose to $135.1 million, or $1.50 a share, from $130.8
million, or $1.46 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent to
$1.4 billion from $1.3 billion.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Tandy said its
earnings rose 2.5 percent to $200 million, or $2.23 a share, from
$195 million, or $2.17 a share. Revenue rose 9.2 percent to $2.34
billion from $2.14 billion.

<HEAD>Livestock Futures Break Under Weight Of Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Livestock futures prices plunged Wednesday on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange as the combined weight of the corn market's
recent collapse and large supplies of frozen pork bellies broke the
cattle and hog markets.
   Elsewhere on Wednesday, grain and soybean futures rebounded; oil
futures surged; precious metals retreated; and stock-index futures
advanced.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled .25 cent
to 1.35 cents lower with the contract for delivery in February at
73.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .90 cent to 1.35 cents lower
with January at 84.47 cents a pound; live hogs were 1.32 cents lower
to .10 cent higher with February at 43.60 cents a pound; and frozen
pork bellies were .45 cent to 1.78 cent lower with February at 40.55
cents a pound.
   ``I feel like the market's decided to stop selling the grains and
sell livestock for a change,'' said Paul Hare, a livestock-market
analyst with Chicago-based Linnco Futures Inc.
   That was a facetious reference to steep declines in corn and
soybean futures prices Monday and Tuesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade following an Agriculture Department crop report that showed
larger-than-expected supplies of those commodities.
   But another analyst said it was no exaggeration that the grain
sell-off had spilled over into the livestock markets.
   ``I think it started on the Board of Trade after the grain report
last week,'' said Chuck Levitt, senior livestock analyst with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago. ``With corn down and beans
down, it kind of created a negative overall psychology in the
agriculture sector.''
   Analysts said another factor may have been this week's sluggish
pork demand, which contradicts normal seasonal trends.
   Levitt said the slowdown redirected traders' attention to the
nation's growing supply of frozen pork bellies. The Chicago
Mercantile Exchange reported after the close that supplies in
out-of-town warehouses had increased by 736,000 pounds during the
week that ended Saturday.
   ``January is supposed to be an out month for bellies, but we're
not getting withdrawals on a net basis,'' Levitt said.
   With no bullish news to support the cattle market, prices dropped
below 3- and 4-week lows, triggering a flood of sell orders from
speculators who had been holding out higher prices. Many experts
have predicted that live cattle futures will rise to record highs
above 80 cents a pound by spring.
   ``The well-publicized bull markets are often most vulnerable to a
break, and there were tremendous bullish expectations for the cattle
markets,'' Hare said.
   Corn and soybean futures rebounded on the Chicago Board of Trade
in a largely technical correction from the losses of the previous
two sessions, analysts said.
   And wheat futures rallied strongly late in the session on rumors
that China was seeking to buy or had bought 750,000 metric tons of
U.S. wheat for delivery this summer.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be true,'' said
Katharina Zimmer, a grain-market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc.
   Wheat settled 3 cents to 6 higher with March at $4.39} a bushel;
corn was 2} cents to 6 cents higher with March at $2.70{ a bushel;
oats were 4{ cents to 6 cents higher with March at $2.37} a bushel;
and soybeans were unchanged to 8} cents higher with March at $7.71 a
bushel.
   Energy futures surged ahead on the New York Mercantile Exchange
with crude oil prices breaking the psychologically important
$19-a-barrel level and reaching new 14-month highs.
   Wholesale home heating oil and unleaded gasoline were up more
than a penny a gallon.
   Analysts attributed the rally largely to a bullish trade report
on oil production and to continued optimism that the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will abide by its
production-cutting pact that went into effect Jan. 1.
   ``It seems there's a general perception that the steps taken to
shore up this market are no temporary affair ... and that OPEC has
found the discipline it needs,'' said Peter Beutel, an analyst with
Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Gold and silver futures prices fell modestly on New York's
Commodity Exchange in reaction to the dollar's gains against major
foreign currencies, analysts said.
   Gold settled 70 cents to $1 lower with February at $403.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 3.9 cents to 4 cents lower with March at $5.97 a
troy ounce.
   Stock-index futures advanced strongly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of stocks
represented by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled 2.60 points
higher at 288.70. The contract is worth $500 a point.

<HEAD>Investors Considering National Lampoon Bid Are Named to Magazine's
Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investor group led by actor Tim Matheson has
been named to the board of directors of National Lampoon Inc., the
magazine and entertainment company said Wednesday.
   The group headed by Matheson _ who starred in the National
Lampoon-produced movie ``Animal House'' in 1978 _ said last month it
might seek control of the firm.
   At that time, National Lampoon Chairman Matty Simmons said the
group, Grodnick Matheson Co., told him it might not pursue a
takeover if they were named to company's board.
   On Wednesday, Simmons announced that the board had been expanded
from four to seven directors, with Matheson and his partners, Daniel
Grodnick and Alan Parsow, filling the three new seats.
   Matheson's group owns 21 percent of the outstanding stock in the
publicly-traded National Lampoon.
   Grodnick Matheson Co. is a Los Angeles-based independent
production firm. Simmons said last month National Lampoon is
recovering from a four-year economic slump that he said was
contributed to in part by opposition by fundamentalist religious
groups and the Justice Department's Commission on Pornography.
   On Wednesday, Simmons said Grodnick and Matheson would be part of
a new management committee. ``They are experienced entertainment
executives ideally suited to contribute to the everyday operation of
the company,'' he said.
   National Lampoon said Grodnick Matheson had retained Batchelder &amp;
Partners for advice in raising capital for the magazine and
entertainment company. Batchelder was founded by David Batchelder, a
former key adviser to takeover strategist T. Boone Pickens Jr.

<HEAD>Dollar Rallies Despite Worsening Trade Figures; Gold Slips</HEAD>

   Money traders scrambled to buy dollars Wednesday
and boosted the currency despite a surprisingly big monthly U.S.
trade deficit, confounding conventional wisdom that when the
imbalance grows the dollar drops.
   Moreover, the dollar's strength grew despite repeated
intervention by central banks, which sold the currency about an hour
after the trade report was released in Washington.
   ``This is the last time we ever want to pay attention to the
trade numbers again,'' said Zlatko Glamuzina, a senior foreign
exchange dealer for the New York branch of Italy's Banco di Sicilia.
   Gold prices eased in U.S. trading. In New York, Republic National
Bank quoted bullion at $401.75 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EST, compared
with $402.50 at the same time Tuesday.
   The big story was the dollar's resilience despite a surprisingly
huge $12.5 billion excess of imports over exports for November
reported by the Commerce Department. Market predictions were for an
$11 billion deficit.
   The dollar declined initially when the trade number was released,
but quickly stabilized against key currencies _ a signal to
professional speculators that the dollar was undervalued and they
should buy it.
   ``It was a trade number that would indicate sell dollars, which
was done,'' said Stuart Yannalfo, a senior foreign exchange dealer
at Refco Inc., a New York commodities futures firm. ``But then it
stopped on a dime, buyers came in and the entire market realized the
dollar wasn't going down any further.''
   The Federal Reserve entered the market at least three times to
peddle dollars, but traders said the moves only slowed the dollar's
rise and provided more opportunities for buying what they considered
cheap dollars.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.20 Japanese yen to 127.90 yen. Later
in London it was quoted at 128.45 yen. By the time trading ended in
New York the dollar fetched 128.64 yen, up from 127.83 yen late
Tuesday.
   The dollar gained against the British pound in London, where
sterling fetched $1.7550 vs. $1.7680 late Tuesday. Later in New
York, sterling was quoted at $1.7535, down from $1.7707 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with rates late
Tuesday, included: 1.8721 West German marks, up from 1.8495; 1.5915
Swiss francs, up from 1.5746; 1.1906 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1982; 6.3825 French francs, up from 6.3065; and 1,370.375 Italian
lire, up from 1,355.375.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with rates late
Tuesday, included: 1.8705 marks, up from 1.8505; 1.5890 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5755; 6.3800 French francs, up from 6.3085; 2.0925
Dutch guilders, up from 2.0855; 1,356.75 lire, up from 1,354.00; and
1.1937 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1973.
   In gold trading, the New York Commodities Exchange quoted bullion
for current delivery at $402.30 a troy ounce, down 40 cents from
Tuesday. Earlier in London, gold remained unchanged at $402.25; in
Zurich, it rose 15 cents to $402.40; and in Hong Kong it rose 21
cents from Tuesday to $404.64.
   Silver bullion for current delivery fell 3.9 cents on New York's
Comex to $5.905 a troy ounce. In London, silver rose 2 cents to
$5.94 an ounce.

<HEAD>American Home Products Profit Up 11 Percent In 4th Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Home Products Corp. on Wednesday
reported its fourth quarter net income rose 11 percent from a year
earlier, buoyed by higher sales in its health care products, food
and household products businesses.
   The company posted a profit of $238.6 million, or $1.63 a share,
in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $215.2
million, or $1.47 a share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Sales during the quarter rose to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion a
year earlier.
   Net sales rose by 7 percent for health care products and 8
percent for food and household products.
   Results also benefited from a lower effective tax rate due to
changes in the federal tax code last year.
   For the full year, American Home had a profit of $932.2 million,
or $6.38 a share, on sales of $5.5 billion. That compared with a
profit of $845.1 million, or $5.73 a share, on sales of $5 billion
for all of 1987.
   American Home's products include over-the-counter medications
such as Anacin and Dristan, household products such as Sani-Flush
toilet cleaner and Black Flag insecticides, and foods such as Chef
Boy-Ar-Dee and Jiffy popcorn.

<HEAD>Fed Authorizes Five Banks to Underwrite Corporate Debt</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: ADDS 3 grafs with congressional reaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday
authorized five of the nation's largest banks to underwrite
corporate debt and said it would decide in a year whether to allow
banks to underwrite stock.
   The unanimous decision by the seven-member board greatly expands
the type of underwriting permitted, but still severely limits the
quantity of underwriting.
   In 1987, the board approved bank underwriting of municipal
revenue bonds, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities and
securities backed by consumer loans.
   In line with previous decisions, the Fed said bank holding
companies may only conduct securities underwriting through a
separate subsidiary regulated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission. And, the subsidiary may earn no more than 5 percent of
its revenue from underwriting activities authorized Wednesday and in
1987.
   The rest of the revenue must come from other types of business,
such as the underwriting of general obligation bonds issued by
municipalities and of U.S. government securities, two areas that
have always been open to banks.
   The five percent limit is designed to comply with the
Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act which separated commercial and
investment banking as part of the reforms passed by Congress
following the 1929 stock market crash and subsequent wave of bank
failures.
   In another restriction, the Fed prohibited loans from federally
insured banks and savings institutions to their securities
affiliates.
   Also, the Fed said it ``expects banking organizations
contemplating major expansion proposals to maintain strong capital
levels substantially above minimum levels.''
   ``This is quite a conservative framework for conducting this
activity,'' said Michael Bradfield, general counsel of the Federal
Reserve.
   He noted that the board said previously it plans by mid-year to
consider whether to raise the revenue limit to 10 percent.
   The five bank holding companies affected by Wednesday's decision
are Citicorp, the nation's biggest; Chase Manhattan Corp.; Bankers
Trust New York Corp.; J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Inc., and Security Pacific
Corp.
   The decision permits the underwriting of all types of corporate
debt, including bonds that can be converted into stock, provided the
convertible bonds sell for 15 percent more than the equivalent
amount of stock.
   Bradfield said the board decided to see how well banks do with
debt underwriting before considering whether to allow stock
underwriting.
   ``The board felt it was appropriate to proceed cautiously,'' he
said.
   Bradfield said once the banks show they have the necessary
managerial knowledge, operational capacity and capital to safely
underwrite corporate debt, final approval will be issued ``on a
fairly automatic basis,'' perhaps as soon as 30 days.
   The Fed's decision fits in with a trend in recent years in which
advances in bank deregulation have come through administrative and
court decisions. Congress is fragmented on the issue and failed last
year to pass comprehensive legislation restructuring the financial
system.
   Donald Oglivie, executive vice president of the American Bankers
Association, a trade group, praised Wednesday's move as ``another
positive step by the Fed toward banking reform.''
   ``This should increase competition in the financial services
industry and lower cost for consumers and businesses,'' he said in a
statement.
   However, Edward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry
Association, said the Fed action ``represents piecemeal dismantling
of the appropriate separation which exists in the financial services
industry _ a system which has worked exceedingly well for more than
50 years.''
   The SIA has launched court challenges to previous deregulation
moves by the Federal Reserve. O'Brien, in his statement, said only
that the SIA would review the decision.
   Two of the most vocal opponents in Congress of weakening the
Glass-Steagall barriers criticized the Fed decision.
   ``The Fed is on its way to giving banks an invitation to shoot
craps with the taxpayer's money,'' said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ``This is the
kind if irresponsible behavior that gave us the savings and loan
crisis and brought about the 1929 crash.''
   ``It's troubling that regulators would go ahead and legislate
simply because Congress hasn't done what they wanted it to. It's
galling,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House
Banking Committee.

<HEAD>Quarterly, Annual Profits Up 13 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Wednesday its
fourth-quarter and 1988 annual profits each rose 13 percent on
revenue gains of more than 10 percent for each period.
   Fourth-quarter net income reached $248.7 million, or $1.71 per
share, for the latest quarter from $219.6 million, or $1.51 per
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 10.9 percent to $3.65 billion from
$3.29 billion a year earlier.
   For the full year, profits rose to $822.8 million, or $5.66 per
share, in 1988 compared with $724.8 million, or $5.02 per share, in
1987.
   Sales for the year rose 10.6 percent to $12.5 billion from $11.3
billion a year earlier.
   Westinghouse has been extracting itself from less profitable
businesses by selling them or arranging mergers and joint ventures.
   Operating profits rose in the fourth quarter and for the year in
the company's industries, electronics and broadcasting groups.
   Operating profits fell for the quarter and were unchanged for the
year in the energy and utility group, while they fell for both the
quarter and the year in the commercial group.
   Financial services' operating profit held steady for the year but
declined significantly in the fourth quarter due primarily to
increased loan charge-offs and additions to loan loss reserves.

   Two former top officials of the defunct Golden
Pacific Bank were convicted Wednesday of federal conspiracy and
fraud charges for the secret diversion of $15 million in depositors'
money.
   Former chairman Kuang Hsung Joseph Chuang and Theresa Shieh, the
bank's former vice president, were each convicted of the scheme,
which federal officials said led to Golden Pacific's 1985 collapse.
   Golden Pacific, once one of the largest banks in Manhattan's
Chinatown, had 21,000 depositors and $160 million on deposit when it
was closed by federal bank regulators, causing a near riot among
anxious customers.
   Chuang, 47, of Staten Island, and Ms. Shieh, 36, of Flushing,
Queens, were convicted of defrauding Golden Pacific customers and
the government by selling millions of dollars in bogus certificates
of deposit, called ``yellow certificates'' because they were printed
on yellow paper.
   The yellow certificates were not federally-insured, as are real
CDs, and the certificates' sales were kept off the bank's books and
hidden from federal bank regulators.
   The money was used to generate a multi-million slush fund under
the defendants' personal control and also to cover up failed loans
and other high-risk investments.
   The federal Comptroller of the Currency declared Golden Pacific
insolvent on June 21, 1985 and the bank was later taken over by
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp.
   Chuang and Ms. Shieh each face a maximum penalty of more than 100
years in prison when they are sentenced March 17 by U.S. District
Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Aaron
Marcu.

   AT&amp;T's board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting
Wednesday, but ``we have nothing to say about anything in connection

   Unfazed by disappointing news on international
trade, stock prices staged a broad advance Wednesday that carried
the market to new highs since the 1987 crash.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 24.11 to
2,238.75, surpassing the recovery peak of 2,226.07 it reached last
Friday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,036 up, 474 down and 468 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 187.54 million
shares, their highest level so far in the new year, against 143.93
million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 220.23 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported Wednesday morning that the
nation's trade deficit widened to $12.51 billion in November from a
revised $10.26 billion the month before.
   The latest number exceeded most advance estimates on Wall Street.
But the news had only a short-lived impact on the markets.
   The dollar and bond prices quickly rebounded from it, and as they
moved higher stocks followed their lead.
   Wall Streeters said they were heartened to see the market
shrugging off unfavorable news on the trade situation, which has
been a touchy issue for the markets for a long time.
   They also described the pickup in trading activity as a
significant plus, suggesting that the market's recent advance was
attracting a wider following among investors.
   Meanwhile, the market also absorbed the news of quarterly
earnings from International Business Machines Corp. that fell
slightly short of expectations.
   IBM, which posted profits of $3.97 a share for the fourth quarter
against $3.47 in the like period a year earlier, sold off early in
the day but finished with a 1[ gain at 125.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, Exxon rose ] to 45[;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph | to 29}; Ford Motor ~ to 53, and
General Electric | to 45~.
   Tandem Computers jumped 1| to 18\. The company reported earnings
for its first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31 of 32 cents a share, up
from 24 cents in the comparable period a year earlier.
   RJR Nabisco slipped [ to 95[ in active trading. Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. said it had lined up more than $14 billion in bank
loans to help finance its buyout of the company.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $26.34 billion, or 0.94
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
1.53 to 161.01.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.58 to 331.56, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 2.98 at 286.53.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market picked
up 2.83 to 388.88. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 318.22, up 1.65.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit widened to $12.5 billion
in November, the government said Wednesday in a report many private
economists and even the Reagan administration viewed as a sign of
the severity of the country's trade troubles.
   But the news that the trade imbalance was the biggest in five
months and higher than advance predictions had little impact on
financial markets, which posted strong performances.
   The stock market rose in heavy trading, with the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials climbed 24.11 to 2,238.75, surpassing its
post-crash peak of 2,226.07 it reached last Friday.
   Some of the power driving equities higher came from the
surprising resilience of the dollar. Frequently in the past, a poor
trade report induced currency dealers to dump dollars but on
Wednesday heavy buying pushed the dollar higher against most leading
currencies.
   Taking a cue from the currency markets, bond prices rose with the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gaining nearly $7 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   In commodity markets, crude oil futures continued their recent
rally and pierced the important psychological level of $19 a barrel.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the key grade of U.S. crude, settled at $19.26 a
barrel, up 31 cents from Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department trade report said the gap was 22 percent
larger than October's $10.3 billion deficit, reflecting a surge in
imports, particularly for business capital goods, and a slight drop
in exports.
   ``We have a serious competitiveness problem in this country,''
said Lawrence Chimerine, head of the WEFA Group, an economic
consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``There's a limit to how much
you can improve by cutting costs and driving the dollar lower.''
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the November
performance was of concern but ``we trust this is an aberration and
does not change the overall trend.''
   Even with the November deterioration, the trade deficit for the
first 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of $137.3
billion, almost 20 percent below the all-time imbalance of $170.3
billion set in 1987.
   Departing Commerce Secretary C. William Verity, a top
administration trade expert, said the November report was
disappointing evidence that the country's trade problems are far
from being solved. He said the rapid pace of improvement in the
first part of 1988 had leveled off in recent months.
   ``All of this means that we have a long way to go,'' Verity said
in a statement. ``We must continue to improve our efficiency and
quality at home and pursue our efforts to reduce trade barriers
abroad.''
   In brighter economic news, the Federal Reserve Board reported
that U.S. industry operated at 84.2 percent of capacity in December,
the highest rate in nine years.
   Much of the increase reflected the boom U.S. manufacturers have
enjoyed in export sales as the weaker dollar made their products
competitive once more on overseas markets.
   However, analysts said the November trade report showed that
until Americans' appetite for imports is curbed, the trade imbalance
will remain stuck in the $130 billion-a-year range, further
increasing the country's dependency on foreign investment as
Americans hand over billions of dollars every year to foreigners in
exchange for cars, televisions and other imported products.
   President-elect Bush faces the problem of trying to improve
America's trade balance in order to keep the economic recovery
alive. But analysts said he must accomplish that task without
erecting more trade barriers and further worsening global trading
tensions.
   ``The trade report is disturbing. It is evidence that for the
last seven months we haven't made any progress on the trade
adjustment process,'' said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at
Merrill Lynch in New York.
   The November deficit was the largest since a $13.2 billion June
imbalance. November's deficit reflected a big jump in imports, which
shot up to $39.7 billion, $1.6 billion above the October level and
the second highest level on record. Exports fell by $639 million to
$27.2 billion.
   Many economists believe that the U.S. dollar, which actually rose
a bit in the last year, will have to decline further to spur more
export gains.
   For November, the 4.2 percent rise in imports reflected big
increases in shipments of business capital equipment, which rose by
$1.1 billion, and consumer goods, which climbed by $697 million.
   The auto category actually dropped by $229 million during
November and the nation's oil bill fell a slight 0.4 percent to
$3.13 billion, reflecting a drop in both the amount of oil imported
and the price, which edged down to an average of $13.38 per barrel.
   The rise in capital goods reflected increases in U.S. purchases
of iron and steel products, airplanes and heavy equipment such as
metal working machinery. Faced with high operating rates, American
industry has been rushing to expand production facilities. In many
cases, however, the new equipment has been purchased from overseas
suppliers.
   The 2.3 percent drop in exports in November reflected declines in
sales of U.S. farm products and capital goods.

<HEAD>Stock Sale in Lyondell Subsidiary is 3rd Biggest Initial Offering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. put half its Lyondell
Petrochemical Co. subsidiary up for sale to the public Wednesday in
an initial stock offering that, at $1.2 billion, is the third
biggest by a U.S. company.
   The sale of 40 million shares of Lyondell stock at $30 a share is
being underwritten by Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Proceeds from sale of stock in the Houston chemical manufacturer
will go to oil major Arco, with potential uses including purchase of
oil-producing property and repurchase of Arco stock, said
spokeswoman Jacqueline Wilson.
   Lyondell, which produces fuel and lubricants as well as oil-based
chemicals, has been approved for listing on the New York Stock
Exchange, Arco said. Its symbol on stock lists will be LYO.
   The stock sale ranks as the third-largest initial public offering
by a U.S. company, although two other companies have gone public at
the same $1.2 billion price, according to IDD Information Services
Inc., which compiles such data.
   Consolidated Rail Corp., known as Conrail, went public with a
$1.65 billion stock sale in 1987 and Henley Group Inc. had an
initial public offering of $1.3 billion in 1986. Duff &amp; Phelps
Selected Utilities and Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. both went public
at $1.2 billion.
   Arco owned all of Lyondell's 80 million shares prior to the sale.
It has given the underwriters the option of buying 6 million shares
to cover over-allotments. That could dilute Arco's ownership to 42.5
percent, and if that happened, the Los Angeles-based company said it
would repurchase shares on the open market to keep its holdings just
under 50 percent.
   Here, according to IDD, are the biggest initial public offerings
by U.S. companies:
   Consolidated Rail Corp., $1.65 billion, March 26, 1987
   Henley Group Inc., $1.3 billion, May 20, 1986
   Lyondell Petrochemical Co., $1.2 billion, Jan. 18, 1989
   Duff &amp; Phelps Selected Utilities, $1.2 billion, Jan. 21, 1987
   Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., $1.2 billion, Nov. 21, 1986
   MFS Multimarket Income Trust, $1.1 billion, March 5, 1987
   Fireman's Fund Corp., $824 million, Oct. 23, 1986

<HEAD>Molson, Carling Creating Brewing Partnership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian brewing giants Molson Cos. Ltd. and
Carling O'Keefe announced Wednesday they're joining forces to create
a new super-company capable of tapping the vast U.S. beer market.
   The new company, an equal partnership between Molson and Carling
parent Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia, will be called Molson Breweries
and will have combined sales of about $2.3 billion, Marshall Cohen,
president and chief executive officer of Molson, told a news
conference.
   He said the venture will control slightly more than half the
Canadian market while ranking as the sixth-largest brewer in North
America and the 20th largest in the world.
   ``This North American partnership ensures Canada has a position
in the highly competitive world beer market,'' Cohen said. ``We want
to penetrate the North American market and increase our exports
considerably.''
   Analysts described that objective as elusive, given the intense
jockeying for market share south of the border.
   In Canada, Carling and Molson together employ about 7,000 people
at 17 breweries.
   Executives of the new company will meet over the next 10 days to
develop a $200 million, 2-year strategy for ``rationalizing'' these
operations that will mean the creation of large, modern plants
comparable to those in the United States.
   Plant closings _ possibly one per Canadian province _ and layoffs
will inevitably result, although about half the jobs lost will be
through attrition and early retirement, said John Elliott, Elders
chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``The Canadian brewing industry is one of the most inefficient in
the world,'' Elliott said. ``There is not one plant in Canada that
is up to the minimum efficiency requirements to compete against the
United States.''
   Molson and Carling together currently export to the United States
about 15 million cases of beer a year, an amount they hope to
increase to 40 million, Cohen said.

<HEAD>AMR Doubles Annual Earnings in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AMR Corp., the parent of American
Airlines, on Wednesday reported record net earnings for 1988 of
$476.8 million, more than double the $198.4 million it earned in
1987.
   AMR also said its 1988 profit-sharing fund will total $121
million. The fund will be paid to employees in March.
   AMR's earnings per share for 1988 were $7.66, up from $3.28 in
1987.
   AMR also set a net earnings record in the fourth quarter of 1988
of $116.7 million, or $1.87 a share, compared with a 1987
fourth-quarter net loss of $805,000.
   ``Our share of domestic industry passenger miles increased by
more than that of any major carrier during the year,'' said AMR
Chairman and President Robert L. Crandall. ``In the fourth quarter,
American Airlines carried more revenue passenger miles and provided
more available seat miles than any other carrier.''
   AMR's revenue for the year increased 22.6 percent to $8.82
billion, up from $7.20 billion.
   American's yield, or average amount of revenue per passenger
mile, increased 7.7 percent from 1987, while revenue passenger miles
increased 14 percent from the year before.
   AMR's revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $2.37 billion, an
increase of 25.8 percent from the $1.88 billion in the fourth
quarter of 1987.
   American flew a record 64.77 billion revenue passenger miles in
1988, up 14 percent from 56.79 billion flown in 1987.
   In the fourth quarter, American flew 16.71 billion revenue
passenger miles, up 21.3 percent from the fourth quarter of 1987.

<HEAD>Ameritech's Profit Up 4.1 Percent in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ameritech Inc., citing the popularity of cellular
phones and a big increase in new phone lines, on Wednesday reported
a 4.1 percent rise in net income during 1988 to $1.24 billion.
   Revenue during the year increased 3.7 percent to $9.9 billion,
the company said.
   ``Revenue growth reflects an increase of 375,000 Ameritech Bell
company customer lines, up 2.5 percent over the prior year _ the
largest increase in our history,'' said William L. Weiss, Ameritech
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Ameritech is the parent of Bell telephone companies serving
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.
   The 1988 results also reflect growth at an Ameritech arm, the
Ameritech Enterprise Group.
   The unit reported a 14 percent increase in revenue, due mostly to
a 68 percent increase in cellular lines, to more than 146,000.
   Adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split, Ameritech earnings per share
in 1988 were $4.55, up from $4.24 in 1987.
   Net income for the fourth quarter was $309.7 million, down from
$322.2 million for the same period in 1987. The company said
fourth-quarter revenue was reduced by higher expenses and the
absence of divested operations.

<HEAD>Pharmacy Board Votes That Premier a Cigarette, Not Regulatable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arizona Board of Pharmacy voted
Wednesday to define R.J. Nabisco Inc.'s new Premier ``smokeless''
tobacco product as a cigarette, beyond its power to regulate sales,
despite critics' wishes to label it a drug-delivery device.
   The board also reiterated its request of two months ago that
Nabisco voluntarily withdraw Premier from Arizona test markets, as
well as its call for a rapid decision by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration on whether the product is a cigarette, as Nabisco
says, or a drug-related system.
   The company again declined.
   ``We would not withdraw the product from the market based on a
request from the Arizona Board of Pharmacy,'' said Betsy Annese, a
company spokeswoman in Winston-Salem, N.C.

<HEAD>Holly Farms Directors Consider Buyout Offers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of Holly Farms Corp. met late
into the night in New York Wednesday to consider $1 billion takeover
bids from two rival suitors.
   Officials on all sides of the long-running battle for control of
Holly Farms and leadership of the U.S. chicken industry declined
comment Wednesday.
   Executives of ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb., declined to say
whether they raised their bid for Holly Farms. Rival bidders at
Tyson Foods Inc. of Springdale, Ark., could not be reached for
comment.
   Holly Farms executives said they did not expect to announce
results of the meeting until this morning.
   If the board recommends a sale to ConAgra and if shareholders go
along with that recommendation, Holly Farms executives have said the
company is expected to operate independently of the food
conglomerate.
   If the board recommends that shareholders sell their stock to
Tyson, and the shareholders follow that advice, Holly Farms will
become part of the poultry empire founded by a man who ran out of
gas in Springdale, Ark., and started what became the country's
largest chicken processor.
   ConAgra is seeking court permission to proceed with a contract
reached in November to acquire Holly Farms.
