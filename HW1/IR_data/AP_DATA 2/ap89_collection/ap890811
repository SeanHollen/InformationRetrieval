<HEAD>John Meillon, Outback Character in ``Crocodile Dundee'' Movies, Dies
at 55</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Meillon, an actor best known for
his roles as an outback rowdy in the Crocodile Dundee movies, died
Friday, friends said. He was 55.
   Meillon was found dead in his Sydney home by a friend. The cause
of death was not yet known. His agent, Bill Shanahan, said he had
no details of the actor's death.
   Meillon, whose acting career began at age 11, became prominent
worldwide as Paul Hogan's outback sidekick in ``Crocodile Dundee''
and ``Crocodile Dundee II.''
   But earlier roles won Australian television and film awards and
led to his being named by Queen Elizabeth II as an Officer of the
British Empire.
   Bill Gardner said he believed Meillon's favorite film role was
as a single father dealing with his young son's fatal cancer in the
``The Fourth Wish.''
   ``He was very selective in the roles that he did _ he refused
many because he did not think they were good enough and money never
entered his head,'' Gardner said.
   Actor Noel Ferrier called Meillon one of Australia's premier
actors.
   ``I was always a bit in awe of Meillon because he was one of
those actors ... that when he gets on stage or when he gets in
front of a camera, you never felt he was acting,'' he said.
   Actor Michael Craig admired Meillon for his daring.
   ``He would hold a pause longer than anyone else dared to do _
and get away with it,'' he said.
   Meillon's other films included ``Sundowners'' and ``Picture Show
Man.''
   Survivors include his second wife, Bunny Gibson; his first wife,
actress June Salter; and a son, John Meillon Jr.
   Funeral arrangements are pending.

<HEAD>Claims Opposition Leader Received $10,000 from Communist Spy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said Saturday that
opposition leader Kim Dae-jung received $10,000 from a lawmaker
accused of being a spy for communist North Korea.
   They made the announcement at the formal indictment of Rep. Suh
Kyung-won, 52, and his aide, Bang Yang-kyun, 34. If convicted of
spying, Suh and Bang could be sentenced to life in prison.
   The prosecution claims that Suh, a member of Kim Dae-jung's
Party for Peace and Democracy, secretly visited North Korea in
August 1988 and received $50,000 from communist leaders.
   There was no immediate comment from Kim Dae-jung. Kim Won-kee, a
senior member of the opposition party, called the allegations
``complete fabrications.''
   The prosecution's claim that Kim Dae-Jung received money from
Suh followed allegations linking the leader of the largest
opposition party to the spy case. Kim Dae-jung has denied the
allegations.
   An earlier prosecution statement said that Suh was recruited by
North Korean agents operating in West Germany in 1985 and they gave
him $70,000 over a three-year period. It said Suh informed North
Korea about the political situation and dissident movements in
South Korea.
   The prosecution said Suh has confessed. It said Suh claimed Kim
Dae-jung gave him $1,000 a few days before he made the trip to
North Korea and when Suh returned he gave Kim Dae-jung $10,000.
   Prosecution officials said they would subphoena Kim Dae-jung to
determine if he had received $10,000 and knew it was from the North
Koreans.
   The prosecution claims that both Kim Dae-jung and Kim Won-kee
knew in April 1988 about Suh's planned trip to North Korea.
   Under South Korea's security laws, it is a crime not to inform
authorities about planned contacts with North Korea.
   Kim Dae-jung, who ran for president in 1971 and 1987, was
questioned by government intelligence officials last week about
possible involvement in the spy case.
   After the interrogation, Kim Dae-jung said he had been cleared
of all allegations but the Agency for National Security Planning
(NSP) said the investigation would continue. Officials said the NSP
was trying to determine if Kim Dae-jung had sent a message to North
Korean leaders through Suh.
   Six people have been indicted in the spy case but they have not
been arrested. They were charged with failing to report Suh's
activities to authorities.

   Terrorists hurled grenades in three
separate attacks around Guatemala City, killing one bus passenger
and injuring eight, authorities reported.
   Police said they had not determined who carried out the attacks
and no individual or group claimed responsibility.
   They said a grenade was thrown at a bus in the suburb of El
Limon and a woman was killed. Rescue workers said eight other
passengers were taken to a hospital.
   The other grenade explosions caused damages but no casualties.
One grenade was thrown at a church where a Roman Catholic priest
was saying Mass and another exploded at at the building housing the
Guatemala office of the Organization of American States.
   There has been a surge of violence in Guatemala during the
10-week-old strike by about 35,000 of the nation's 40,000 teachers,
who are demanding more pay.
   President Vinicio Cerezo has said the government cannot afford
to meet the demands. The Education Ministry said if a settlement is
not reached by Monday it will fire the striking teachers.
   Among the victims of the violence was a prominent member of the
Christian Democrat Party and friend of the president, who was
assassinated.
   Some of the violence has been blamed on right-wing militants,
who claim Cerezo is too liberal.
   Cerezo's inauguration in 1986 ended more than three decades of
military rule, and he has survived two coup attempts.
   In recent weeks, teachers have taken over buildings in Guatemala
City and border crossing stations to protest the government's
firing of 527 teachers for participating in the strike.
   The strikers are seeking a monthly increase of $80. Their
salaries now range from $136 to $328 per month.
   About 300 teachers crossed into southern Mexico and applied for
political asylum, claiming they had been harasssed by the Cerezo
government, two regional strike leaders said Friday.
   Strike leaders Victor Sosa Lopez and Amilca Escobar said the
teachers crossed into Chiapas state.
   Striking teachers have been blocking the international bridge on
the Guatemalan side of the border with Mexico since Thursday
afternoon, causing a traffic snarl on both sides.
   Reporters in the Mexican border town of Ciudad Hidalgo said they
saw about 50 armed Guatemalan soldiers along with a number of
police deployed near the strikers but they took no action.

   Most of the patients in a recent hepatitis
outbreak in a rural Illinois county either admitted intravenous
drug use or are suspected of it, according to federal health
authorities.
   Seventeen cases of non-A, non-B hepatitis were reported between
Nov. 15 and June 30 in Wabash County, Ill., a rural area which had
reported only one other such case since 1982.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that
interviews and medical records showed seven of the 17 patients
admitted abusing intravenous drugs, and five ``were suspected IV
drug users.''
   The outbreak apparently began with an IV-drug user who returned
to the area and began sharing drug needles with other users before
becoming ill, the CDC said.
   Non-A, non-B hepatitis, transmitted via injections such as drug
needles or transfusions, accounts for between 20 percent and 40
percent of the viral hepatitis in this country, the CDC said.
Studies have shown that as many as 42 percent of such cases are
associated with drug use, the Atlanta-based agency said.

   The nations of Central and South America have
made significant progress in their polio-eradication efforts in
recent years, U.S. health officials said.
   In the Americas, a record low 335 confirmed polio cases were
reported last year, down 64 percent from 930 confirmed cases in
1986, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said Thursday. The
progress follows a 1985 Pan American Health Organization initiative
to eradicate indigenous transmission of wild polio virus by the end
of 1990.
   With special efforts toward the remaining pockets of polio, the
1990 goal ``probably can be achieved,'' the CDC said. But at this
point, transmission may continue in several countries, including
Brazil, which reported 106 cases in 1988, and Peru, which reported
58, the CDC said.
   Polio, a paralyzing, viral disease, has been essentially
eliminated in the United States, although the CDC said reports of
some cases, related directly to polio vaccine, are pending. Canada
reported just one confirmed case in 1988.

   Isak Turi climbed a 22-foot-high electricity pylon in the

   A spokesman for the regional power company was quoted as saying
it was amazing that Turi, the son of a reindeer herder, survived.
   Bakke told Verdens Gang that eight years ago he saved Turi when

   ``Isak has always been a tough kid who will dare anything,''
Bakke said.

   China's film industry, which had previously
encountered controversy in selecting its annual award-winners, did
not name a ``best picture'' this year, the official Xinhua News
Agency said.
   The China Film Association each year selects the recipients of
the Golden Rooster awards, but ``a lack of outstanding films'' made
it impossible this year, Xinhua quoted film experts as saying
Thursday.
   Awarding of the Golden Rooster has created controversy in recent
years as China's film industry becomes increasingly bold and
creative. But since the military crushed the student-led
pro-democracy movement in June, the government has cracked down on
dissent and criticized some reforms as having gone too far.
   This was the first time since the award was established in 1981
that no film was named best picture.
   Golden Rooster award-winners for best actor, best director and
best actress were named, but the film association said there would
be no award ceremony this year.
   This year's top honors for the ``Hundred Flowers'' awards, based
on public opinion polls, went to ``The Village of Widows,'' billed
as China's ``first sex movie'' and about marriage customs in a
coastal town in Fujian province; ``Chuntao,'' about the life of a
woman in the 1930s who lives as a garbage picker; and ``The
Republic Will Never Forget,'' about the construction of a major
steel plant.
   Announcement of the Golden Rooster award-winners was delayed two
years in a row because of behind-the-scenes wrangling.
   In 1986, judges debated for months before giving the award to
``Wild Mountain,'' about conflict between spouses over tradition
and modernization.
   In 1987, awarding of the Golden Rooster was delayed until the
following year. Conservatives in the leadership apparently objected
to the portrayal of petty, power-hungry party officials in ``A
Small Town Called Hibiscus,'' about a woman branded as a capitalist
during the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   Last year, the award-winners were named on time, but only after
heated public debate about ``The Old Well'' and ``Red Sorghum,''
both of which focused on backwardness and poverty in China.

<HEAD>Gen. Colin Powell: `A Complete Soldier'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gen. Colin Powell, tapped as the next chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is widely viewed as an adroit
politician and pragmatic commander capable of representing the U.S.
military at a time of sweeping change both home and abroad.
   Powell, 52, was nominated on Thursday by President Bush to
become the nation's top military officer.
   ``I am ready to go to it and I look forward to the challenges
ahead,'' Powell said.
   He's expected to win easy Senate confirmation and make history
as the first black and the youngest-ever officer to hold the post.
   Powell, who served as national security adviser in the final
year of President Ronald Reagan's administration, will succeed Adm.
William Crowe Jr., who is retiring Sept. 30.
   Bush praised Powell, a decorated veteran of two combat tours in
Vietnam, as ``a complete soldier'' as well as a distinguished
scholar.
   ``As we face the challenges of the '90s, it is most important
that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff be a person of
breadth, judgment, experience and total integrity,'' Bush said.
``Colin Powell has all those qualities and more.''
   Powell fits the mold of Bush's national security advisers,
like-minded pragmatists who favor consensus-building rather than
confrontation.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Service
Committee, called Powell ``an excellent nominee.'' Nunn said his
panel will hold confirmation proceedings soon after Congress
returns from recess in September.
   The four-star general's associates predicted he will work hard
to present all sides to the commander-in-chief.
   ``He was marvelous to work with, because he could deal with all
the internal conflicts'' that the National Security Council adviser
must resolve for the president, said Dan Howard, former NSC
spokesman who was recently confirmed as undersecretary of the Navy.
   ``Colin was an honest broker. ... He was very fair in presenting
others' viewpoints. That doesn't mean he didn't have one, because
he did. He was just very fair, and could present all sides without
putting a `spin' on it. That's a rare talent in this town,'' Howard
said.
   Such abilities will be essential when Powell is called upon to
deal with the intense rivalries that can afflict the Pentagon.
Contests among the services are widely expected to reach new highs
as the military budget shrinks and the assessment of the Soviet
threat diminishes.
   As well, Powell is seen as a wise choice by those who have seen
the role of chairman evolve into one where diplomacy and political
finesse with Congress are as essential as toughened battlefield
instincts.
   Powell's nomination was met with surprise by some in the
Pentagon, given that his political credentials are deemed to have
outweighed his military experience. But those who know him contend
his mix of jobs, in command roles and political trenches of
Washington, will stand him in good stead.
   ``He's been head of the NSC. He's commanded troops in Europe.
He's dealt with the (National) Guard and reserve in his current
post and he's been at the elbow of the secretary of defense. He's
had experiences few can match,'' said Robert Sims, a former
Pentagon spokesman who knew Powell when he served as Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger's military aide.
   Powell currently is commander of the Army Forces Command in Fort
MacPherson, Ga., responsible for the combat readiness of 1 million
troops on active, reserve or National Guard duty.
   Along with his predecessor as national security adviser, Frank
Carlucci, Powell was credited with helping the Reagan White House
recover from the Iran-Contra affair. He was a key figure in the
planning of Reagan's national security strategy and for his summits
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Before his stint at the NSC, Powell commanded the Army V Corps
in West Germany for six months. Earlier, he was Weinberger's senior
military assistant from 1983-86.
   Powell was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in New York City
and raised in the South Bronx.
   He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1958 after earning a
bachelor's degree in geology at the City University of New York. He
got his first taste of the White House in 1972 during a stint as a
White House fellow at the Office of Management and Budget.
   Powell served in Southeast Asia as an adviser to South
Vietnamese units in 1962 and 1963 and as executive officer of an
infantry battalion and as a division operations officer in 1968 and
1969.
   Holder of a Purple Heart for being wounded in combat, Powell
also won the Bronze Star for valor.

<HEAD>Increase in Youth Suicides Expected in Late 1990s, Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Public health officials must prepare now to
meet an expected upswing in youth suicides in the late 1990s, says
a task force that recommends educating more people about the
warning signs.
   In a report released late Thursday, the task force said that
while mental illness is often related to suicide, many young people
who take their own lives don't have a major mental illness.
   ``An estimated one-third of all young people who commit suicide
do not appear to fit the known picture _ suicides occur in loving
and supportive families as well as in disrupted families, among
high-achieving as well as low-achieving students,'' said the report.
   The task force was appointed in May 1985 by then-Secretary of
Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler and held a series of
national conferences on youth suicide.
   The report said that among the 28,620 Americans who committed
suicide in 1985, about 4,760 were between the ages of 15 and 24.
For this age group, suicide is the second leading cause of death,
after accidents.
   The suicide rate among 15- to 24-year-olds climbed steadily from
1950, when the rate was 4.5 per 100,000, to 1979, when it reached
12.4 per 100,000, the report said.
   Between 1979 and 1985, the rate declined to 12 per 100,000
people in this age group, though experts believe this may be due to
a decline in the age groups' population during that period, the
report said. The experts said that when the number of people within
an age group increases, such things as homicides, drug use and
suicides also rise.
   With an increase in the number of adolescents projected for the
late 1990s, the task force said public health officials must
prepare now to meet another expected upswing in suicides.
   Only a portion of young suicide victims had a major mental
illness, the report said. However, many had a history of ``conduct
disorders characterized by impulsive, aggressive, antisocial
behavior, often complicated by substance abuse.''
   Others were socially inhibited ``perfectionists or prone to
extreme anxiety in the face of social or academic challenges,'' the
report said.
   The report said the breakup of a relationship, a recent arrest
or rape were the most common events leading to suicide. Other risk
factors included drug and alcohol abuse by the victim or a member
of the victim's family, loss of a parent, a history of abuse or
neglect and homosexuality.
   The task force said public health officials need to develop a
uniform definition for suicide so it can be reported more
consistently and completely.
   The report also recommends more research to determine what
prevention strategies work best and better education efforts to
make the public and health service providers more aware of the
warning signs and better prepared to provide care for those who
need it.
   The report said three times as many females ages 15 to 24 as
males in that age group attempt suicide, but five times as many
males in that group succeed.
   Guns were the most frequently used method for suicide victims in
this age group, followed by hanging, drug overdose and jumping from
a high place.

<TEXT>
   Regulators are moving quickly to attack the
savings and loan crisis, shutting down three small institutions the
day after President Bush signed landmark bailout legislation.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., a new agency created by the law,
said Thursday that it had closed thrifts in Florida, Texas and
Illinois. The action came just hours after the Treasury Department
said it had raised the first $5 billion in bailout money.
   In all three closings, regulators transferred the failed
institutions' deposits, up to the insurance limit of $100,000 per
account, to healthy banks or savings and loans. The closed thrifts'
branches will reopen today under the names of the institutions
acquiring the deposits.
   They are:
   _Liberty Federal Savings and Loan Association, New Port Richey,
Fla., acquired by Citizens and Southern National Bank of Florida,
Fort Lauderdale. Liberty had four offices with $56.5 million in
assets and deposits of $90.1 million in 7,900 accounts. Citizens is
paying $1.1 million to take over the deposits.
   _Park Cities Savings Association, Dallas, acquired by Comerica
Bank-Texas, Dallas. Park Cities had one office with $48.1 million
in assets and $39.7 million in deposits in 1,400 accounts. Comerica
is paying $20,000 to take control of the deposits.
   _First Savings of America, Orland Park, Ill., acquired by St.
Paul Federal Bank for Savings, Chicago. First Savings had three
offices with $21.3 million in assets and $46.5 million in deposits
in 8,900 accounts. St. Paul paid $1.2 million for the deposits.
   The acquiring institutions all retain an option to purchase
loans and other assets of the failed savings and loans. The
government will have to sell what the institutions don't take.
   Meanwhile, the RTC said Thursday it took control of three
additional thrifts, keeping its list of problem S&amp;Ls at 262 in 33
states.
   Those three, which remain open under government management are:
People's Heritage Federal Savings and Loan Association, Salina,
Kan., with $2 billion in assets; Unifirst Bank for Savings,
Jackson, Miss., with $835 million in assets; and Metropolitan
Financial Savings and Loan Association, Dallas, with $853 million
in assets.
   The law signed by Bush authorizes the government to borrow $50
billion over the next 26 months for the savings and loan bailout.
   The Treasury Department raised the first $5 billion in bailout
money as part of its regular quarterly sale of debt. One-third of
the $15 billion in 247-day cash management bills sold Thursday at a
yield of 8.36 percent is earmarked for the RTC.
   Money from the cash management bills won't be available until
Tuesday. In the meantime, the Treasury Department has made $215
million available to the RTC to cover Thursday's transactions.
   By the time it finishes its work, the RTC is expected to have
dealt with about 500 ailing institutions.

   The sweeping reorganization of the savings and
loan regulatory bureaucracy is creating a slew of new acronyms for
fans of federal alphabet soup.
   Here's a tongue-in-cheek glossary of some of the phrases that
will soon be on every bureaucrat's lips, as well as those that _
mercifully _ will fade into history:
   _SAIF, a reassuring acronym pronounced ``safe,'' as in ``Your
money is safe if it's insured by SAIF.'' It stands for Savings
Association Insurance Fund, an organization once called FSLIC
(pronounced fizz-lick). Unfortunately, FSLIC fizzled, creating the
crisis that led to the bailout.
   _OTS (pronounced oats) is the Office of Thrift Supervision. It
was once called FHLBB, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (pronounced
flub). Usage: FHLBB flubbed its job, so it was folded into the
Treasury Department and renamed OTS.
   Under a preliminary version of the bill, OTS would have been
called COSA (pronounced coh-sa _ Chairman of the Office of Savings
Associations). But that was dropped, perhaps because it stirred
unpleasant memories of allegations that FHLBB was too cozy with the
industry it regulated.
   _BIF (pronounced like the sound created when Batman or Robin
slugs a crooked thrift executive) is the Bank Insurance Fund. Now
that the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.) has control of two
insurance funds, one for commercial banks and the other for
thrifts, it had to come up with a name for the bank fund.
   _FIRREA (pronounced fih-ree-ah). It stands for Financial
Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. At a
White House ceremony, President Bush said, ``I'm proud to sign this
monster.''
   _The RTC (Resolution Trust Corp.) was created by FIRREA. It's
charged with disposing of billions of dollars in real estate the
government is inheriting from failed S&amp;Ls. Members of Congress
fervently hope the RTC (no catchy pronunciation) won't conduct a
FIRREA sale, ruining property values in their district.

<HEAD>Bigeye Bomb `Years Away From Production,' Congressman Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tests conducted by the Pentagon on the Bigeye
chemical bomb are incomplete and major developmental questions are
unresolved, says a congressional agency.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that the Bigeye bomb is years
away from readiness for production,'' said Rep. Dante Fascell, the
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who requested the
study from the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative
arm.
   The Bigeye bomb is a binary chemical weapon the Defense
Department plans to build to modernize the U.S. arsenal. In
February 1988, President Reagan certified the bomb as essential to
national security, authorizing the Pentagon to spend $90 million to
build production facilities.
   However, the GAO said Thursday that the Defense Department used
one test to reach its conclusion that pressure buildup will not be
a problem for the Bigeye. The GAO also said the number of tests on
flashing were insufficient.
   Pressure buildup could destroy or disable the weapon. Flashing
is the burning or vaporization of a chemical agent.
   Fascell's panel released an unclassified version of the report.
The classified form included comments from the Defense Department.
   The Pentagon earlier had said ``full-scale production of the
weapon is not planned until 1990.''
   Fascell said that this year ``Congress wisely instructed the
Pentagon to keep the Bigeye in testing until these problems were
solved.''
   Binary weapons take their name from the fact that they are
composed of two chemicals kept separate until the bomb is dropped
or artillery shell fired. The two chemicals are harmless until
mixed, at which point they form a deadly gas.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Contra Demobilization Plan Leaves Right Crotchety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To most people, former President Reagan went a
bit far a few years ago when he called the Nicaraguan Contras the
``moral equivalent of the founding fathers.''
   If the Contras don't rank with the likes of Thomas Jefferson in
the eyes of the majority, they have been one of those causes that
has kept conservative brows in a fevered state for years.
   And when Central American presidents set a Dec. 5 deadline
Monday for the demobilization of the Contras, conservative wrath
was once again energized.
   On no issue since the Vietnam war have conservatives and
liberals squared off as they have over the Contras. Democrats saw
Reagan as contributing to massive death and destruction in a
country that could never pose a security threat to the United
States.
   Conservatives saw Democratic resistance to the Contras as
guaranteeing the survival of a Marxist-Leninist regime intent on
spreading the gospel according to Fidel Castro right up to the Rio
Grande.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., long a stalwart Contra backer, called
the proposed dismantling of the Contras a ``disaster.'' He said
that outcome might have been averted if Congress had shown more
willingness to stand by the Contras rather than strip them of
military aid, as it did last year.
   Hyde and like-minded conservatives, such as former Assistant
Secretary of State Elliot Abrams, could never understand the
congressional hostility toward the Contras.
   Hyde said Congress has a penchant for funding rebel groups in
such remote countries as Afghanistan, Cambodia and Angola but an
inexplicable aversion to helping out an insurgency in nearby
Nicaragua.
   If Nicaragua were 12 time zones away, Hyde said, the Contras
would be riding around in ``Rolls Royce jeeps, shooting silver
bullets and sipping Coors beer between battles,'' all compliments
of the U.S. Congress.
   Abrams spent four years as the executor of Reagan's Central
America policy, a role he carried out with a devotion that was so
uncompromising that, among Democrats, he was quite possibly the
most disliked official in the administration.
   Now in private business, Abrams was in a grim mood after the
Central America summit. He suggested that if the Democrats work
their will, U.S. aid will be manipulated by Congress in such a way
that the Contras will face the choice of starving in Honduran
border camps or risking their lives or imprisonment by returning to
Sandinista-led Nicaragua.
   Abrams said Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani entered the
summit hoping to win approval of a resolution putting the Contras
on an equal footing with the leftist guerrilla movement in his
country.
   But Cristiani backed away and acquiesced in the consensus
resolution to demobilize the Contras but not the FMLN in El
Salvador.
   As Abrams saw it, Cristiani felt that congressional Democrats
would punish him by cutting off aid to El Salvador if he were
responsible for a stalemated summit.
   That, in turn, would leave El Salvador vulnerable to a takeover
by the leftist guerrillas, a price that Cristiani was unwilling to
pay, Abrams said.
   Much of the debate in the coming months is expected to focus on
where the Contras will settle. To many outsiders, a process of
national reconciliation in Nicaragua is under way and the Contras
will be able to return safely to their homeland without fear of
reprisal.
   Hyde disagreed and said the administration should do what it can
to help the Contras resettle in the United States. Initially, he
said, he favored their relocation in Fort Worth, Texas _ home of
former Rep. Jim Wright, who fought Contra funding tooth and nail as
House speaker.
   But with Wright's resignation this past spring, the Fort Worth
option has lost its appeal. Hyde's alternate suggestion, delivered
in jest, is that Connecticut, home of anti-Contra warrior Sen.
Chris Dodd would make a fine home for the Contras as well.

   Suspected spy Felix S. Bloch is protected from
being fired or losing his pension while the case against the U.S.
diplomat is investigated, an official of the foreign service union
says.
   ``There's a certain amount of due process,'' Charles Schmitz, a
State Department diplomat and vice president of the American
Foreign Service Association, said Thursday.
   ``He can be stripped of his pension if he's convicted of treason
or some other high crime.''
   The State Department put Bloch, a 30-year foreign service
officer, on paid leave from his job June 22. Soon after, the State
Department announced that the FBI was investigating him for
``illegal activities'' involving ``agents of a foreign intelligence
service.''
   Bloch has not been charged with any crime.
   ``The department does not bring charges unless it believes it
has sufficient evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt that a person is guilty of violating the law,'' Justice
Department spokesman David Runkel said Thursday when asked about
possible charges against Bloch.
   Administration sources have said there is a videotape of Bloch
passing a briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris. That same agent
later was monitored giving Bloch what officials believe was a
telephone warning that he was under suspicion.
   FBI agents have been interviewing people acquainted with Bloch,
asking questions ranging from whether he had a foreign girlfriend
to if he was a stamp collector. Bloch reportedly told the FBI the
briefcase contained stamps.
   Agents and the news media have monitored Bloch's every move,
including walks with his pet poodle. This week, Bloch and his
entourage took a 22-mile trek and on another day camped on a park
bench for a few hours.
   Should Bloch be fired, Schmitz said, he would be entitled to an
administrative hearing. That decision could be appealed to a
federal court in the District of Columbia.
   Bloch's pension would amount to 60 percent of his $77,500 annual
salary.
   Pre-trial publicity has jeopardized any chance of a fair trial,
Schmitz said.
   ``If he's guilty, there's a lot that muddied the case. If he's
innocent, his reputation has been pilloried in public; his career
has been in effect terminated,'' he said.
   Schmitz described Bloch, whom he said he knew only slightly, as
``sturdy, diligent, solemn, solid.''

   A lawyer defending hotel ``queen'' Leona
Helmsley on charges of tax evasion is expected to be named head of
criminal tax prosecutions for the Justice Department, sources say.
   James A. Bruton III, part of the four-member defense team at
Mrs. Helmsley's federal trial in New York City, would be a deputy
assistant attorney general in the tax division, department sources
said Thursday.
   The appointment is not expected to be made until after the
Helmsley trial concludes. The department's tax division oversees
all federal tax fraud cases.
   Bruton, 39, is the choice of Assistant Attorney General Shirley
Peterson, head of the tax division, to oversee the unit's criminal
tax section, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``I can't comment,'' Bruton said Thursday when asked during a
break in the trial about the possible appointment. He had been
cross-examining an Internal Revenue Service agent.
   A partner in the Washington firm of Williams and Connolly,
Bruton was a trial lawyer in the Justice Department's tax division
and had worked for the IRS general counsel.
   Mrs. Helmsley, who appears in national ads as ``the queen of the
Helmsley Hotels,'' is accused of evading $1 million in federal
income taxes by writing off $4 million worth of personal purchases
as business expenses.
   A former housekeeper testified that Mrs. Helmsley once told her:
``We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.''
   Mrs. Helmsley and her husband, Harry, run a $5 billion real
estate and hotel empire. Helmsley, 80, was charged but isn't
standing trial because he was declared mentally incompetent.
   The Helmsley case is one of the most highly publicized criminal
tax cases brought by the Justice Department in recent years.
   Prosecutors say the Helmsleys wrote off as business expenses
such renovations to their Greenwich, Conn., estate as the
installation of a marble dance floor and a sound system that pipes
music to a barbecue pit.
   The defense team is led by Gerald A. Feffer, who was deputy
assistant attorney general in the tax division during the Carter
administration.
   The prosecution is expected to rest its case early next week.
   Also on trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan are former
Helmsley hotel executive Frank Turco and Joseph Licari, once a top
Helmsley aide.

<HEAD>Task Force Recommends Environmental Safeguards in Oil Drilling</HEAD>
<HEAD>For release 5 a.m. EDT; time set by source</HEAD>

   Improved environmental safeguards are needed
before any oil exploration can occur in three disputed sites off
the California and Florida coasts, a task force said today.
   The task force, charged with recommending to President Bush
whether to open the three sites for oil exploration, made clear in
a progress report that it has made no decision on whether drilling
should be allowed.
   But it said that before a decision is made, additional
restrictions are needed to ``reduce the environmental impact'' of
such drilling. It outlined a long list of options aimed at
improving environmental safeguards, but said no decision has been
made on which ones to recommend to the president.
   In February, Bush directed the task force to examine the
environmental concerns surrounding the proposed oil drilling on the
two California sites, which together cover nearly 8 million acres
off the state's northern and southern coasts.
   He also asked for a review of plans to sell leases for oil
development in a third site, covering 14 million acres in the Gulf
of Mexico near the Florida Everglades.
   There has been strong opposition to opening the three areas to
the oil companies because of fear that drilling would endanger
nearby environmentally sensitive areas. The concern intensified
after the massive oil spill from the Exxon Valdez tanker last March
in Alaska.
   The task force, headed by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, has
conducted nine hearings so far and a recommendation is to be made
at the end of the year.
   The report said that during the hearings, most of more than 650
witnesses and some 11,000 written comments have expressed intense
concern about the potential environmental harm that could be caused
by oil exploration at the three sites.
   ``Many people expressed the view that while they would suffer
the losses from any environmental effects of oil and gas
development, they stand to gain few, if any, of the potential
benefits,'' said the task force. At the same time, the group noted,
oil and gas industry spokesmen disputed the environmental concerns
and suggested the risks are minimal.
   The task force said various ``restrictions designed to reduce
the environmental impacts of oil and gas development'' should be
considered before deciding whether to allow drilling.
   Options cited by the task force include the widespread use of
buffer zones between drilling sites and environmentally sensitive
areas, and an array of proposals to protect against oil spills or
control damage if a spill should occur.
   Other options include requiring oil from the three areas to be
transported to shore by pipeline and not tanker; that oil companies
hold a special bond to assure adequate compensation for spill
damage; that permanent emergency response teams be established with
adequate equipment, manpower and training, and that tankers, if
allowed, be limited in size and have double bottoms.

   Their motto is ``Be Prepared,'' but some
Boy Scouts say they were not ready for what they found at a rainy
camp-out in Norway.
   Half the 19,000 Scouts were girls.
   ``When we have a Boy Scout Jamboree in the states, it's strictly
boys. We were taken a little off guard,'' said Charlie Hart,
scoutmaster of an American troop for the children of U.S. soldiers
based in West Germany.
   Eight Soviet boys also were among the 2,500 visitors from 26
nations at the Norwegian National Jamboree.
   ``This is first time we have had Soviets at a Norwegian
jamboree, and may be the first time anywhere, since the Soviets
don't have scouting,'' said camp spokesman Per-Olav Lie.
   He said the boys, members of the Soviet Communist Party Youth
Organization, were sponsored by the Lions Club in Moss, Norway.
   Norway formed coed scout troops in 1978, said Anne Marie
Kristensen, a spokeswoman for the weeklong jamboree, which ends
Sunday.
   Organizers said that no thefts, vandalism or use of alcohol were
reported so far at ``the biggest scouting event in the world this
summer,'' being held on 185 acres of fields 15 miles west of Oslo.
   ``There have been quite a few cases of puppy love ... but having
boys and girls together teaches them mutual respect,'' said Gary
Andrew, of U.S. Troop 204, based in West Germany.
   Dan Warren flew in from the United States as one of 30 Scouts
from Troop 368, of Arlington, Mass. Warren said he discussed poetry
with Norwegian Girl Scout Kirril Kaas while they shared a rain
poncho.
   Steven McClenaghen, 14, of a British boys troop from Inverness,
Scotland, said camping with girls ``is more like the real world.''
   ``My girls are very popular. They are the only American girls
here,'' said Carol Butler, a California scout leader who heads a
U.S. Girl Scout contingent of eight, picked from 300 applicants
throughout the United States.
   Coed camping was not the only suprise awaiting foreign scouts
when they arrived last Sunday.
   ``When they said bring rain gear, we thought they meant
raincoats. But when Norwegians say rain gear, they mean head-to-toe
waterproofing,'' said one American scout slogging along a muddy
trail.
   A Norwegian girl cried ``Mud ... mud... mud'' from a soggy tent.
A Greek Girl Scout shivered in the rain.
   However, a troop from Switzerland said the weather was no
problem.
   ``We got here in the middle of the night and had to set up camp
in the pouring rain. It doesn't matter. We can set up these tents
blindfolded, in any weather,'' said Marcel Zollinger, of a coed
troop from Effretikon, Switzerland.
   Norway's King Olav V, the Norwegian royal family and domestic
celebrities visited the jamboree.
   ``I couldn't believe how open it was. I walked right up to the
king,'' said Scoutmaster Alex Hodge, of Troop 419 from the U.S. Air
Base at Lakenheath, England.
   Norwegians may joke about camp romance, but they also engage in
traditional scout activities such as hiking and outdoor skills.
There is also a daily camp newspaper and radio station.
   Today they were to try to break the world barbeque record, held
by a school in Hawaii, by feeding all 19,000 scouts from 700 grills.

<TEXT>
   On a cold day last November, the Wassef
family left the snug anonymity of their middle-class Detroit
neighborhood for the half-world of spies and intrigue so often
associated with the Middle East.
   It's a tale of two sons, born in Egypt and reared as Americans,
and a personable American soldier of fortune the Egyptians say is a
CIA agent.
   It's a story the Egyptian government has made little fuss over,
one the U.S. government has largely ignored.
   To Beba Wassef, the mother, ``It's a nightmare.''
   In mid-July, in a 90-minute trial without witnesses, a security
court convicted Samy Wassef, 26, and his brother, Samir, 30, of
spying for the United States. Each was sentenced to 10 years in
prison and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($3,850).
   The prosecutor said their crime was agreeing with a foreign
intelligence agency to sell information from newspapers and other
sources about Moslem fundamentalism, Moslem-Christian relations,
Egypt's economy and other topics.
   Samir, a pediatrician, is in the United States. Samy is in
prison.
   Also sentenced was Nicholas Edward Reynolds, who left Egypt in
the fall of 1987. Friends knew him as a maker of travel films based
in California; he was identified at the trial as the Wassefs'
Central Intelligence Agency spymaster.
   Security police knocked on Samy Wassef's door Nov. 14 and
``invited'' him to accompany them for questioning. He had graduated
from the Cairo University medical school and was about to return to
the United States.
   Samy was held in a prison south of Cairo for eight months,
uncharged despite a confession, which he said investigators
essentially fabricated. He had occasional visits from family,
consular officials and lawyers.
   Little has changed since the trial, except that Egypt considers
him a convicted traitor.
   Beba Wassef calls her son ``the forgotten American.''
   Mrs. Wassef, who has heart problems and high blood pressure, is
trying to change that. She said she spent months quietly asking for
help from the Egyptian and U.S. governments. Now she is shouting.
   ``All these months I trusted the Americans. I felt secure that
they were helping Samy,'' she said. ``Yesterday I learned the
truth. An embassy official admitted nobody has discussed Samy's
case with the Egyptian government. All these months!
   ``He's rotting in jail. His life is ruined. His career is
ruined. His health is deteriorating.
   ``And the Americans have never brought it up?''
   She said she was told one problem for the U.S. government is
that Egypt considers her son Egyptian, not American.
   That, she said, is ``rubbish.''
   ``Samy entered Egypt on an American passport, which has been
taken away by Egypt,'' his mother said.
   ``He is an American. He feels like an American. He loves
America. He came here to study medicine, but that doesn't mean he
left his citizenship at the airport.''
   When Mrs. Wassef visited the U.S. Embassy on Sunday, as she does
almost daily, she quoted President Bush's weekend statement about
Joseph Cicippio, an American hostage in Lebanon whose kidnappers
suspended a death sentence against him last week.
   ``He said that just being an American is enough for your
president, the senators, everybody to care about you,'' she said.
``He mentioned a big, loving family in Norristown, Pa., that's
eating its heart out.
   ``I can understand that, because we have a big, loving family in
Detroit that's doing the same. But nobody cares about Samy.''
   The embassy's position has been that the Wassefs receive
``normal consular services.'' It said the ``embassy supports any
action Mrs. Wassef feels she must take to help her son.''
   On Monday, embassy spokeswoman Marcelle Wahba said: ``The
embassy will not issue statements, because the matter is under
legal consideration.'' Requests for interviews with consular
officials were denied.
   In Washington, Rep. William Broomfield's office said the
Michigan Republican had urged the State Department and Egyptian
officials to get Samy Wassef released, spokesman Bob Jenkins said.
   ``We're going to do everything we can to win Sami's freedom and
get him back to Michigan,'' said a spokesman, Bob Jenkins.
   He said Broomfield, ranking Republican on the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, had written to President Hosni Mubarak and Abdul
Raouf el Reedy, Egypt's ambassador to the United States.
   A congressional source said Egypt was sensitive about the case
and wanted it handled quietly. The source said an Egyptian court
was expected to review it soon.
   The Wassefs say Samy and Samir met Reynolds several years ago,
when Reynolds asked them to contribute information for Cairo Today,
an English-language magazine.
   Reynolds, who had been educated at impressive universities in
the United States and England, kept a low profile in Cairo.
   He told acquaintances he made documentary films while working
for Sobek, a travel and adventure company based in Oakland and
Angel's Camp, Calif. Sobek employees told The Associated Press he
had worked for the firm several years ago, but that Sobek had lost
track of him.
   The main evidence presented at the trial was Samy's 253-page
confession, which included details of spy activities and training
in a secret American spy school. It was written in Arabic, which
Mrs. Wassef says her son reads poorly.
   ``Except for a couple of pages, the whole thing was fantasy,''
she said. ``To understand why Samy signed it is to understand his
condition. He had been locked up without legal or consular help. He
had been showed pictures of ropes, torture victims, things like
that.
   ``They told him his luggage was outside with a ticket home. All
he had to do for freedom was to sign that paper. And he did.''
   She said the confession was signed before the first visit to her
son Dec. 8 by Conrad Drescher, the U.S. consul general. Embassy
sources say Drescher now visits every two weeks.
   ``We've spent all our money, our time since November, trying to
do something,'' Mrs. Wassef said. ``I had to leave our small son in
Michigan. I've missed his birthday, my husband's birthday. Our
friends and relatives in Michigan have sent letters. ... All this
time, and the American Embassy didn't do anything?''
   The family has averaged a telephone call to the embassy every
other day for most of the time her son has been in jail, she said.
   ``What do they think we all were calling for, just to hear their
voices?'' Samy Wassef's mother asked. ``We were desperate for help,
and who does an American turn to for help but to his embassy?''

   Headless aliens from space invade Russia!
   ``Huge hairy creature'' terrifies villagers in the Volga valley!
   Possible UFO lands in Moscow!
   Although President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms haven't
spawned U.S.-style supermarket tabloids _ let alone U.S.-style
supermarkets _ glasnost has changed the Soviet media, as evidenced
by these recent stories, and a lot of people seem to love it.
   The change is evident on state-run television, once a showcase
for morally uplifting and dull ``Boy-Loves-Tractor'' movies about
building communism, and news reports lauding factories
overfulfilling the Five-Year Plan.
   Now, six days a week, as part of the breakfast TV program ``120
Minutes,'' gray-haired mystic Alan Chumak waves his hands on camera
to cure viewers from Minsk to Vladivostok of what ails them.
   Soviets with heart disease are requested to watch the
self-described journalist on Tuesdays. On Fridays, Chumak will help
viewers get rid of allergies. People with stomach bugs or bone and
muscle aches should tune in on other days.
   The inability to watch the program is not a problem. Leave the
set on, and a jar of water, juice or massage cream placed by the TV
screen supposedly will be ``charged'' by Chumak's gestures and can
be used later for treatment.
   Earlier this summer, after about a month on the air, Chumak was
pulled off ``120 Minutes'' by broadcast executives, who said they
wanted to make sure his treatment brought positive results.
   They must have been convinced _ the man in his mid-50s was back
on TV waving his hands within a week.
   Since the days of the wild-eyed monk Rasputin, hypnotist and
confidant at the court of the last czar, Russians have been
intrigued by the occult and fantastic, and stories about UFOs,
vanished planets and ESP have always had an eager audience.
   With glasnost, or greater openness, such topics are getting more
exposure than ever in the once stuffy official Soviet media, and
despite the firmly materialistic and rationalist ideology of the
ruling Communist Party.
   In fact, the unlikely organ in the forefront of the weirdness
campaign belongs to the party itself. The 1 million-circulation
daily newspaper Socialist Industry, an organ of the party's Central
Committee, has a mandate to report on the Soviet economy, but often
makes space for news items that have nothing to do with either
socialism or industry.
   On Tuesday, there was this intriguing account of invaders from
space landing in Central Russia's Perm region: milkmaid Lyubov
Medvedev told the newspaper, ``At about 4:30 in the morning, I was
going to the farm when I saw a dark figure seemingly riding a
motorcycle. ... But when I looked closely at the figure, I noticed
there was no motorcycle, but just something resembling a man, but
taller than average with short legs.''
   The creature had ``only a small knob instead of a head,'' Ms.
Medvedev said. ``I was frightened to death ... then it became
fluorescent and disappeared.''
   Beekeeper G. Sharoglazov saw two egg-shaped ``fluorescent
objects'' as big as aircraft hovering at a height of 600-1,000
feet. Others in mid-July also saw aliens with no heads, the paper
said.
   It quoted V. Kopylov, Communist Party boss in the Chernushinsky
region, as acknowledging that ``something unusual is going on the
territory of our two collective farms.''
   It was Socialist Industry as well that informed Soviets on
Thursday of the huge, fleet-footed hairy creature that terrified
residents of the Kirovo settlement in the Volga basin.
   ``I saw the creature pretty well,'' said resident R. Saitov.
``It was about 2 meters (6{ feet) tall, its body covered with dark
brown hair and it had shoulder-length hair. ... Being a veterinary
surgeon, I can say the creature was neither a man nor an ape.''
   Saitov and a friend tried to approach the creature after
spotting it on the other bank of a pond, but it bounded away at
astonishing speed when they pursued it in a car. The newspaper
noted disapprovingly that Saratov University biologists weren't
taking reports of the sighting seriously or even deigning to talk
to witnesses.
   The very official Soviet news agency Tass later picked up the
newspaper's story for national and worldwide distribution,
headlining it ``Huge Creature Sighted in Volga Region; Men Give
Chase.''
   Earlier this week, however, Tass deflated another Socialist
Industry report about a UFO landing.
   Last month, the paper reported in great detail on a 26-foot-wide
patch of burned ground found near a southern Moscow highway.
   It quoted UFO specialist A. Kuzovkin as saying the grass had
likely been blasted by powerful radiation, which he called probable
evidence of the landing of an Unidentified Flying Object.
   Not so, Tass reported. Firefighters think a haystack simply
caught fire and scorched the ground.

<HEAD>Ling-Ling May Give Birth, Despite Aborted Fetus</HEAD>

   Although Ling-Ling has spontaneously aborted a
tiny fetus, zoo officials say the National Zoo's female giant panda
could still give birth to a full-term cub later this month or in
September.
   Zoo officials hope the 20-year-old panda was carrying twins, as
panda mothers do in about 60 percent of pregnancies. Ling-Ling has
given birth to one set of twins previously.
   ``It's possible there's another cub in there and on its way,''
said zoo spokesman Robert Hoage.
   Hoage said the nickel-sized panda fetus was found on the floor
of Ling-Ling's cage Thursday morning. The fetus weighed less than
one gram.
   The gestation period for pandas lasts from 97 to 168 days,
according to zoologists.
   Panda fetuses often do not attach to their mother's womb
immediately, Hoage said. If Ling-Ling was carrying twins, the other
fetus may have attached itself much earlier, and is now developig
normally, Hoage said.
   In the 17 years that Ling-Ling and her mate, Hsing-Hsing, have
resided at the zoo, the pair have had a variety of troubles mating
and delivering cubs.
   Since 1983, Ling-Ling has had four cubs. The first was born
sickly and died after just three hours. Another cub was stillborn
in 1984.
   In 1987, the panda had twins. The smaller, weaker one died
almost immediately. The other lived nearly four days, a zoo record,
then died of a generalized staph infection.
   Pandas are an endangered species, numbering fewer than 1,000
worldwide. The pair was a gift from China.

   Rising prices are placing new strains
on ordinary Filipinos and threaten social and political unrest as
President Corazon Aquino seeks to restructure the nation's economy.
   According to official figures, consumer prices increased last
month by 10.3 percent _ their highest level since Mrs. Aquino took
power in the 1986 uprising that toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Prices jumped nearly 12 percent in the central Visayas islands
and Mindanao. In a country where $300 a month is considered a
middle-class salary, any substantial price increase means hardship
for the public and political risks for the government.
   ``This will hit the citizenry like a cannonball in the eyes,''
wrote Mrs. Aquino's former spokesman, Teodoro Benigno. ``The
gauntlet comes alive when the public reacts to price increases.''
   Public school teachers and other government employees have
already been agitating for salary increases, which Mrs. Aquino says
the nation cannot afford.
   ``There's no money,'' wrote columnist Conrado de Quiros in the
Philippine Daily Globe. ``Why doesn't the government tell it to
foreign banks? Why should it tell that to its teachers and
workers?''
   Teachers demanded a minimum monthly salary of $215; they now
earn $95, which is below the poverty line. The government has
agreed to $148 a month for teachers.
   ``Even now, there is a growing recognition in government that
the moderately high growth rates of the last three years are
plainly unsustainable,'' wrote the independent daily Malaya.
``Unless bold measures are undertaken, we might as well kiss
recovery goodbye.''
   Many economists believe the outlook is not altogether gloomy.
The economy grew by more than 5 percent in 1988 and is expected to
increase this year by 6 percent.
   Agriculture, the livelihood of more than 60 percent of the 58
million Filipinos, grew by more than 10 percent. Investment jumped
more than 106 percent in the first four months of the year,
according to the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Despite the impressive statistics, the Aquino administration has
been unsuccessful in spreading the effects of growth to the
majority of the population.
   The government acknowledges that the poorest third of society
controls only 9 percent of the national income, virtually unchanged
from the final years of the Marcos administration.
   In parts of Manila, elegant department stores rivaling those of
New York and London stand within a few miles of wretched squatter
camps, where tens of thousands live in clapboard shanties.
   Industrial nations have pledged $3.5 billion in 1990 to help the
Philippine economy. But the government acknowledges that the
effects of the aid may not been seen by ordinary Filipinos for
years.
   Under a controversial policy memorandum to the International
Monetary Fund, the government agreed to a number of measures,
including gradually eliminating subsidies on rice, energy, water
and other essentials.
   That will reduce the budget deficit but is expected to increase
consumer prices. The government also is studying an increase in
fuel prices, which may be increased by the end of the year
depending on the world petroleum market.
   During a recent walkout by government workers, employees of the
Central Bank carried banners denouncing the IMF and calling for
reductions in service payments on the nearly $30 billion foreign
debt. Domestic and foreign debt service accounts for 40 percent of
the national budget.
   Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod, a respected economics
professor, resigned last June after warning that government
economic policies threatened social unrest.

<HEAD>Tobacco Industry Wants Answers to `What is Drug Paraphernalia?'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   There appears to be no easy answer to the
question of what is drug paraphernalia, and businesses complain
that they are losing thousands of dollars in merchandise that is
being seized in government raids.
   ``Are all glass pipes illegal?,'' businessman Richard K. Rowland
asked the U.S. International Trade Commission at a hearing Thursday.
   ``Are all wood pipes illegal? Are all stone pipes illegal or is
there one type that is legal? All I'm saying is give me the rules
and let me steer clear of this legal mine field called the Mail
Order Drug Paraphernalia Control Act.''
   Rowland, whose Contempo Tobacco Products warehouse in Nashville,
Tenn., was raided in March, said the tobacco industry needs ``some
very specific guidelines as to what is and what is not drug
paraphernalia and why.''
   John Esau, director of the Customs Service's commercial fraud
and enforcement center, said about $14 million worth of items had
been confiscated under the 1986 act but that tighter definitions
are needed.
   ``This particular law makes it extraordinarily difficult to
define what is drug paraphernalia,'' Esau said. ``We are going to
rely on the courts to help us define it.''
   The commission, an independent and bipartisan agency established
by Congress to investigate trade matters, is reviewing the imports
at the request of the Senate Finance Committee.
   Among the factors the law says can be used to determine whether
an item is drug paraphernalia are instructions about its use,
advertising, how it is displayed for sale and the existence and
extent of its legitimate uses.
   The act calls for penalties of up to 3 years in prison and
$100,000 in fines for each violation.
   But Rowland and other pipe-business representatives said
manufacturers and retailers can't read consumers' minds and can't
be held responsible for illegal use of legitimate items.
   ``I agree it's tragic there's a drug problem in this country,
but a lack of imagination is the only limit to turning anything
into drug paraphernalia,'' Rowland said.
   After Rowland's warehouse was raided, then-Customs Commissioner
William von Raab announced that the 306,000 items seized _ filling
eight 48-foot containers _ represented the largest such seizure in
U.S. history, worth about $10 million.
   But Rowland said the items confiscated ``are similar or the same
as items or materials that have been in the tobacco industry for
hundreds of years.''
   ITC Chairwoman Anne E. Brunsdale asked witnesses to suggest
guidelines to help define drug paraphernalia, such as a minimum
size of a pipe bowl.
   The only one who offered any ideas was Lorraine Shapiro of The
Mill in Corning, N.Y.
   She suggested a minimum pipe-bowl diameter of three-eights of an
inch and a minimum stem length of 2 inches. Her pipe company, which
uses imported woods, lost about $45,000 worth of inventory through
a Customs-led raid in January, she said.
   Esau also said the Customs Service wants to change required
manifests to help pinpoint questionable items.
   For example, he said, all imported plastic bags are listed as
plastic bags and don't differentiate between garbage bags and 1
{-inch square containers used by jewelers, makers of precision ball
bearings _ and drug dealers.
   The primary exporters of the paraphernalia are Pacific Basin
countries and ``areas of the Middle East,'' Esau testified.
   In an interview, he said Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan were
exporters, adding that the People's Republic of China and Korea may
also export such items.

<HEAD>U.S. Corn Crop Showing Marked Improvement Over 1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn production is showing a 49 percent
improvement over last year's drought-stunted crop, with 1989
estimates at 7.35 billion bushels, the Agriculture Department says.
   In 1988, the corn harvest yielded 4.9 billion bushels.
   The estimates released Thursday were based on USDA's first field
surveys of the year and reflected conditions as of Aug. 1.
   Overall, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board put
total U.S. crop production at 103 percent of the 1977 average, a
scale used to compare output from year to year.
   While corn and soybean production were estimated at about
average for the decade, wheat production across the Grain Belt was
forecast at weaker than usual levels, with fields losing
substantial moisture since early July.
   Corn is the largest and most important crop grown on American
farms and, used as feed, is essential to meat, poultry and dairy
production.
   USDA economists estimated the yield per acre of corn in 1989 at
112.8 bushels per acre, up 28.2 bushels from last year but 6.6
bushels below the record high of 119.4 bushels produced in 1987.
   They estimated that 65.2 million acres would be harvested, up 12
percent from 1988 but 1 percent less than the July forecast.
   Soybean production was estimated by USDA's Agricultural
Statistics Board at 1.91 billion bushels, up 24 percent from last
year's harvest of 1.54 billion.
   USDA economists forecast the soybean yield at 32.3 bushels per
acre, the fourth highest of record and 24 percent above a year ago.
   Production of all wheat was estimated at 2.04 billion bushels,
up 13 percent from the 1988 harvest of 1.81 billion bushels. That
was 3 percent below the July estimate from USDA.
   Winter wheat production was estimated at 1.47 billion bushels,
down 6 percent from last year. Durham wheat was indicated at 90.7
million bushels, up 102 percent from the 1988 harvest but down 19
percent from the July forecast because of drought problems in the
Dakotas.
   The average yield for all wheat was forecast at 32.6 bushels per
acre, just 1.5 below last year's level, with an estimated area for
harvest of 62.7 million acres.
   Other spring wheat was forecast at 487 million bushels, down 10
percent from the July forecast but more than double the 1988 crop.
   With the Soviet grain crop forecast down and export prospects
good, stocks of wheat next June are projected at 474 million
bushels, almost 120 million below last month and 220 million below
the start of the year.
   Cotton production was estimated at 11.8 million bales, down 23
percent from last year and 20 percent below 1987.
   Consumer prices for food rose at an annual rate of 7 percent in
the first half of 1989 as cold weather hit vegetable fields in
Florida, California and Mexico. Poultry prices also rose sharply on
increased demand.
   But USDA economists are expecting consumer prices to rise no
more than 1 percent on an annual basis in the second half.

   The Agriculture Department estimates Soviet
grain production this year at 200 million metric tons, 10 million
below earlier forecasts, and says it expects a rise in imports as a
result.
   The department said Thursday that grain imports by the Soviets
in the year that began July 1 were at 36 million tons, 3 million
above previous estimates
   Hot, dry weather across many of the spring wheat-growing regions
of the Soviet Union, combined with a shrinkage in the growing area
are causing the drop, according to a report from the Foreign
Agriculture Service.
   It estimated wheat production was down 4.5 million tons, to 87
million, and coarse grains decreased by 5.5 million, to 100 million.

   The number of U.S. farms fell 1 percent since
1988, but average farm size grew from 453 acres to 456 acres, the
Agriculture Department says.
   In figures released Thursday, the department estimated the
number of farms at 2.17 million and said land devoted to
agriculture amounts to about 991 million acres, a decrease of less
than 1 percent from 1988 when acreage fell below a billion acres
for the first time.
   Last year, the department said there were 2.19 million farms,
continuing a slide that began in 1982 when there were 2.4 million.
   The proportion of farms with sales less than $10,000 continued
declining. The steepest decrease, as in 1988, was among the
smallest farms _ those earning less than $2,500 a year.
   The size of farms decreased in most economic classes. They grew
for three classes: $2,500 to $4,999; $40,000 to $99,999; $100,000
to $249,999.
   About 15 percent of the farms account for more than 50 percent
of the total farmland and have sales of more than $100,000 each.

   With a thundering oink, Speedy Pigalis II
brought home the bacon when she won the Ohio State Fair annual
Buckeye Pig Race, beating Pigit and I'm A Bore by a snout.
   At first, Speedy trailed by 60 feet, but wedged between Pigit
and I'm A Bore down the stretch of the 80-foot course to secure her
victory oats after Thursday's race.
   But the champion wasn't about to ham it up after the big pig
win. The swine shunned well-wishers and turned her attention
instead to munch on her spoils.
   Trainer Amy Herbkersman, 15, of Collins, won the first-place
purse of $180 while notching her second consecutive title and fifth
overall. Miss Herbkersman won the race last year with champion
Turbo Pig.
   She also was the trainer of second-place I'm A Bore, and her
father, Doug Herbkersman, trained Pigit, the third-place finisher.
   The Herbkersmans put the pigs through a strict regimen at their
Pork Chop Downs facility.
   ``We train hard for about one month up to the race to build
stamina,'' said Judy Herbkersman, Amy's mother. ``They think the
food's down there at the finish line, so they go fast to get down
there.''
   Several pigs, including Chow Sow, Pigit and Pig O' War, shot out
of the gate backward, turning their snouts toward the finish line
and scampering around the competition.
   Other swine entries included Road Hog, Blazing Bacon and Lickity
Chop, but each bowed out in its first race.

   Gov. Bill Clinton has a
suggestion for parents who are angry that their kids can't have
beepers at school to help them protect their expensive automobiles
_ drive crummy cars.
   Clinton said Thursday his office has received several irate
telephone calls from parents about the state law prohibiting the
electronic beepers.
   The problem, the parents said, was that the security systems for
their cars were activated by the beepers, ``and how dare me to
interfere with that,'' the governor told a meeting of juvenile
judges.
   The law was designed to prevent beepers from being used to set
up drug deals in school, Clinton said.
   ``I said, `Listen, I drove a car to school that I couldn't pay
anybody to steal,''' Clinton said. ```And this is more important
than that, and you need to get your kid a worse car.'''

<HEAD>Former Pierce Firm, Aide Got Special Treatment from HUD: Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government records indicate that the
Department of Housing and Urban Development gave special treatment
to deals involving Secretary Samuel Pierce's former law partners
and his one-time top aide.
   The Manhattan law firm of Battle, Fowler, Jaffin and Kheel and
former aide Lance Wilson kept in touch with Pierce during his
eight-year tenure as head of HUD in the Reagan administration,
according to files Pierce left at the agency.
   There have been a number of allegations of favoritism at HUD
during Pierce's leadership. Separate investigations of agency
programs during that period are being conducted by Congress, the
Justice Department and HUD itself.
   The latest records indicate that HUD waived regulations in one
case that allowed developers represented by Pierce's former law
firm to keep lucrative HUD subsidies. In another case, Paine Webber
Inc., where Wilson worked after leaving government service, won a
contract to serve as HUD's financial adviser.
   Both deals had been opposed by HUD staff members, but the
objections were overridden. While the two instances weren't
related, the law firm was involved in both.
   Wilson was first vice president at Paine Webber when it received
a $1.3 million bond contract, despite the fact that a HUD panel had
recommended another company. Battle, Fowler served as bond counsel
to Paine Webber, according to HUD documents and officials.
   Paine Webber told The New York Times it was conducting an
internal investigation.
   ``It's Paine Webber's policy to conduct our business in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations,'' said spokeswoman
Eileen Ruvane, saying the company wouldn't comment until the
internal investigation was complete.
   ``On the basis of the knowledge to date, we have no evidence of
wrongdoing,'' she told the newspaper. ``To imply otherwise, in our
opinion, would be inappropriate and inaccurate.''
   She wouldn't say when the investigation began or which employees
were under scrutiny.
   The developers who retained Battle, Fowler owned an Amherst,
N.Y., project that won an unusual waiver from HUD in 1988 allowing
the project to keep HUD subsidies.
   The developers of Allenhurst Apartments included Manhattan real
estate executive Stephen Ross, who last year contributed $100,000
to the GOP, and Dennis Penman, chairman of the 1984 Reagan-Bush
campaign committee in Erie County, N.Y.
   A HUD inspector general's report questioned whether Penman had
access to internal HUD information that allowed him to win backing
for the project, awarded nearly $27 million in subsidies over 15
years.
   The subsidies were awarded through a discretionary fund
controlled by Pierce, and its availability was supposed to be
advertised by the local housing agency. But HUD's inspector general
found that the agency never advertised the availability of the
money, instead awarding it directly to Allenhurst.
   Because of that, HUD staffers suggested the funding be canceled,
according a HUD official who spoke Thursday on the condition of
anonymity.
   The official was asked about the project after The Wall Street
Journal reported on the Allenhurst deal.
   R. Hunter Cushing, a former ranking department official, backed
a retroactive waiver for the ad requirement, arguing that if the
subsidies were halted the project likely would default and HUD
might have to pay more than $8 million because it had insured the
project's mortgage.
   Battle, Fowler, according to documents obtained by The
Associated Press from the files of Pierce and a former aide,
Deborah Gore Dean, frequently lobbied HUD on behalf of clients.
   In the bond deals, first reported in Thursday's New York Times,
Battle, Fowler served as bond counsel to Paine Webber and Salomon
Brothers, which managed sales of some of the bonds.
   Pierce's files contain a memo from an assistant telling him of
the involvement of Battle, Fowler and Wilson in the bond offerings.
Also, Wilson's name and telephone number are scribbled on a July
1988 a memo to Pierce from James Schoenberger, then HUD's general
deputy assistant secretary for housing, discussing Paine Webber's
involvement in the bond sales.
   HUD officials said the selection of Paine Webber over the
recommendation of a selection committee was made by
then-Undersecretary Carl Covitz. Covitz told the Times he generally
informed Pierce of his activities but didn't recall any
intervention by Pierce on behalf of Paine Webber or Battle, Fowler.
   Pierce kept in close touch with Wilson, his top aide from
1981-84 and whom he once described as his ``right hand.''
   Among the correspondence in the files was a letter from Pierce
to Wilson thanking him for helping arrange a dinner in Pierce's
honor. Wilson also sent his former boss books about wine and New
York city restaurants.

   The government says it will pay farmers in foreign
currency for surplus crops to reduce the country's dependency on
imported grain.
   Under the decree announced Thursday, the government could save
money in the long run since foreign grain is more expensive than
that grown domestically.
   Foreign money can be used to buy hard-to-get imported goods,
providing incentive for farmers.
   Under the new policy, growers on state farms can sell part of
their high-quality wheat, peas, lupine and oil-bearing seeds to the
Soviet government for convertible currency, the official news
agency Tass said. The ruble is not officially convertible, but
foreign money is.
   The government believes that the chance to earn convertible, or
hard, currency will stimulate so much extra production that the
state will end up paying its own farmers less than it would have
paid for imports to make up chronic shortages, Tass said.
   The news agency said the system will be introduced as an
experiment with this year's harvest and run through 1990. The
government also will consider allowing individual farmers with
private plots and those who lease their land to sell for hard
currency as well, Tass said.
   The news agency's report said the policy is in accordance with a
decision of the Congress of People's Deputies.
   During the Congress' session in June, radical economist Nikolai
Shemelev suggested the Soviet Union adopt such a system.
   He said the government should tell collective farm leaders that
``if they sell grain and meat to the state above a certain level
they will be paid in hard currency with the right of spending it
wherever they want.''
   He was interrupted by applause from the 2,250-member parliament,
and then said: ``Our people are modest. I'm sure there's no need to
pay them $200 a ton of grain; they will be satisfied with $75.''
   In a deal announced in late June, the U.S. Agriculture
Department said the Soviets bought 400,000 metric tons of wheat at
about $140 a ton, bringing the 1988-89 total to 4.2 million tons.
   The department on Thursday said it estimated Soviet grain
production this year at 200 million metric tons, 10 million below
earlier forecasts, and said there would be a resulting rise in
imports.
   Tass said the state would pay farmers $96 in hard currency per
ton of strong and durum wheat; $64 per ton of other high-quality
wheat; $128 per ton of pea and lupine, and $144 per ton of
sunflower, soy, rape, flax and mustard seed.
   ``The farms will be free in spending the currency,'' it said.
   Soviet citizens' access to foreign currency is normally very
restricted. Soviets going abroad are allowed to exchange only a
small sum of rubles for hard currency, and ordinary citizens who
have not worked abroad are not allowed to hold foreign currency at
all.
   The restrictions have begun to loosen slightly, however, as more
and more Soviet firms are allowed access to foreign markets under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   The ability to buy foreign goods takes on added significance in
the face of the worsening shortages of such basic Soviet goods as
soap, detergent and medicine under the economic dislocation the
reforms have brought.

   A divorce trial to determine the fate of
seven frozen human embryos has ended, leaving the judge to decide
whether a man can stop his estranged wife from using them.
   ``On one hand, this case involves the ageless power of sexual
reproduction. On the other hand, it involves a branch of science
and man's ability to understand and control nature, which is as new
as today's headlines,'' Charles Clifford, attorney for Junior Lewis
Davis, said in closing arguments Thursday.
   Junior Davis, 30, sued Mary Sue Davis, 28, for a divorce in
February. He asked the court to prevent her from using the seven
frozen embryos they created through an in vitro fertilization
program last December. He contends he has as much right to decide
their fate as his wife.
   Davis wants the embryos, stored at a Knoxville hospital, to
remain frozen.
   But Mrs. Davis says she should be allowed to have the embryos
implanted in her womb, arguing they represent her best chance of
becoming a mother. She also contends Davis is asking to acquire a
right not normally given to a man _ the decision on whether a child
should be born after he has fertilized the egg of his mate.
   Blount County Circuit Court Judge W. Dale Young said he will
announce a decision within 30 days.
   That the embryos are outside the womb should make no difference,
said Jay Christenberry, Mrs. Davis' attorney. ``The journey outside
the womb did not mean the return journey was to be prevented,'' he
said.
   The status of the embryos was an issue throughout the trial.
   Dr. Jerome Lejeune, research director at the French National
Center of Scientific Research, testified Thursday the frozen
embryos are ``early human beings,'' and have been since the moment
of conception.
   ``Putting tiny human beings in a very cold space, deprived of
liberty, deprived even of time, they are suspended as it were in a
concentration camp,'' he said. ``It is not as hospitable a place as
the secret temple of a woman's womb.''
   But Clifford said, ``I think it is very clear that legally,
under the laws of the United States, of Tennessee, an embryo is not
a human being. It does not possess the rights that a human being
possesses.''
   In closing arguments, Christenberry said that Mrs. Davis has a
fundamental right to decide to be a mother.
   ``It seems to me a woman who now has the right to abort a fetus
should have an even greater right to protect the unborn and bear
her child or children,'' he said.
   Clifford disagreed.
   ``If the court allows Mary Sue Davis to use these embryos, the
court makes Junior Davis a father. That burden would be with him
the rest of his life,'' Clifford said. He said if Young rules in
favor of Davis, it would still leave Mrs. Davis a reasonable chance
of bearing a child without using these particular embryos.
   The Davises entered the in vitro program in 1985. The seven
frozen embryos in dispute were yielded by their sixth attempt. Mrs.
Davis had five tubal pregnancies and the couple also tried to adopt
children.
   In in vitro programs, fertilization takes place outside the womb
in a laboratory dish. The fertilized eggs then can be implanted in
a woman's womb and brought to term, although the success rate is
about 18 percent.

<HEAD>Student Loan Default Rate Down From Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The overall rate of student loan defaults this
year is below last year's average, the Education Department says.
   The agency issued a new school-by-school list of student loan
default rates Thursday, and said the overall rate of 17 percent was
4 percentage points below last year's average.
   ``There's a lot of work left to be done, but if the figures
suggest a trend, it's clearly in the right direction,'' Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos said.
   The 17 percent rate is the percentage of borrowers required to
start repaying their loans in fiscal 1987 but defaulted in 1987 or
1988. Figures released earlier this year showed a 21 percent
default rate for those required to start repayments in 1986.
   Nearly 2 percent, or 101, of the schools, which include
colleges, universities and proprietary schools, had default rates
above 60 percent. Two-thirds, or 3,570 schools, had rates below 20
percent.
   Defaults are expected to cost the nation $1.9 billion this
fiscal year. Much of the problem involves proprietary, or
profit-making, trade schools.
   Although the default rate for such schools fell from 40 percent
to 33 percent in the latest list, the rate remains nearly twice as
high as the national average and the rate for two-year colleges. It
is nearly five times as high as the rate for four-year
institutions, the department said.
   The department attributed the decline in the overall default
rate to several factors, including improvements in data quality,
definition changes in calculating default rates, a probable
increase in loan payment deferments and public attention leading to
a reduction in defaulters.
   Schools with default rates above 60 percent, and those above 40
percent that fail to reduce their rates by 5 points a year, will be
subject to penalties and termination starting in January 1991.
   Only schools with at least 30 people due to start repaying loans
in 1987 were included on the department's list.
   Here is a list of the 10 schools with the highest default rates.
The figure in parentheses represents the number of students
entering repayment status. All of the schools are proprietary
except Carlinshar Institute, which is a two-year private
institution.
   Debbie's School of Beauty Culture, Chicago, 90.2 percent (51).
   Sierra College of Business, Los Angeles, 88.3 percent (1,456).
   Louisiana School of Professions, Shreveport, 87.2 percent (234).
   Stevenson's Academy of Hair Design, New Orleans, 86.8 percent
(53).
   Cambridge Technical Institute, Dayton, Ohio, 85 percent (1,947).
   Carlinshar Institute, Chicago, 84.4 percent (160).
   Alma's Beauty College, Detroit, 83.7 percent (49).
   Debbie's School of Beauty Culture, Harvey, Ill., 83.5 percent
(85).
   Baton Rouge Beauty College, Baton Rouge, La., 81.8 percent (132).
   Mane St. International School of Hair Design, Johnston City,
Tenn., 81.1 percent (90).

   Taunts of ``goat face'' caused a
10-year-old boy to drop out of school in his Ecuador village, but
he's returning to classes next month _ with a new face.
   Cesar Guachichulca was born with the left side of his face
deformed as a result of a rare birth defect, Goldenhar's syndrome.
   Last week, surgeons at Cardinal Cushing Hospital in Brockton
corrected his deformed eye, ear and jaw, as well as the V-shaped
patch of hair on his forehead that inspired his classmates' taunts.
   ``We have a saying among our people, `Hope is the only thing you
can't lose,''' the boy's father, Bolivar, said through an
interpreter in Cesar's hospital room last week.
   Then he began to cry and put his face down on a table.
   ``I believe in God and I kept hoping for a miracle. Happiness
doesn't even say it. This is a miracle.''
   Cesar, who his father and doctors said is normally talkative and
articulate, was subdued by the operation. Sitting in his room with
bandages covering his swollen face, he pointed toward his father
and said, ``I look like my daddy now.''
   The boy's trip and surgery was sponsored in part by Por Cristo,
a Brockton-based team of medical volunteers founded 10 years ago
who have treated hundreds of children in Latin America. The Boston
Red Sox baseball team also helped defray expenses.
   Before he left Ecuador, Cesar spoke at length to reporters and
thanked Por Cristo for ``the opportunity they've given me to be a
normal child.''
   He had been the top student at his school in the mountain
village of San Pedro de la Bendita, but Cesar said he left
``because the other children made fun of me.'' He will go back to
the third grade next month.
   Bolivar Guachichulca works seven days a week as a state public
works employee, earning $30 a month. He gets up at 4 a.m. every day
to take a two-hour bus ride to his job site. He takes off one
Sunday a month to spend with his wife and five sons, of whom Cesar
is the eldest.
   The couple at first blamed themselves for Cesar's condition,
Guachichulca said. Their other sons have no facial deformities.
   ``The first question we had was why? Why did this happen to us?
My wife was in tears at his birth,'' he said.
   Some of the residents in the family's remote village thought
Cesar's deformities were caused by the devil.
   When Cesar was 2, his father brought him to doctors near their
village.
   ``They told me there was nothing they could do,'' Guachichulca
said.
   But he persisted for eight years to look for doctors who could
help.
   `I'm like all parents. I want the best for my child,'' he said.
``It only bothered him a little in the beginning but in the last
two years, it's bothered him a lot. He was ashamed of himself.''
   Finally, he heard about Por Cristo. A women's auxiliary
organization in Ecuador helped him contact the group.
   He eventually traveled to the coastal city of Guayaquil to meet
with Martin Dunn, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon who founded Por
Cristo and performed the surgery on Cesar.
   ``Dr. Dunn was the first one to explain to us what it was and
that it wasn't our fault,'' said Guachichulca.
   Cesar told reporters last month he wanted to be a priest. But
now he says he will go back to Ecuador next month with new plans.
   ``I want to be a doctor now,'' he said. ``I want to be able to
help and operate on other children who have problems like I had.''

<HEAD>Scientists Find Targets For Drugs To Control AIDS, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study that describes the precise shape
of a key enzyme of the AIDS virus may help scientists develop drugs
to disable the deadly virus, researchers say.
   Stephen B.H. Kent of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena said Thursday that the discovery was the first accurate
description of protease, an enzyme essential in the reproduction
cycle of the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes
AIDS.
   Pharmaceutical company representatives said drugs that block the
action of protease already are being tested, but that the new study
should contribute to a more detailed understanding of how the virus
works.
   Kent said the description will enable pharmaceutical companies
to develop compounds that will ``fit like a hand in a glove over
the active sites of the enzyme'' and prevent it from producing
reverse transcriptase, the next step in the life cycle of the AIDS
virus.
   AZT, or zidovudine, the only anti-viral drug approved for
treatment of AIDS, works by blocking the action of reverse
transcriptase. Protease, Kent said, is farther ``upstream'' in the
cascade of molecular events that leads to replication of the virus.
   ``If you turn off this protease enzyme, then you stop the
production of reverse transcriptase,'' he said, adding that it
would keep an AIDS virus from making copies of itself and thus
prevent the virus from infecting other cells in the body.
   ``That is the same as killing it,'' he said.
   Mariusz Jaskolski, a member of the the National Cancer
Institute, which worked on the study, said while other researchers
have described the protease enzyme, the new study accurately
locates each atom of the complex molecule.
   Paul Oestreicher, a spokesman for Hoffmann-La Roche, a major
pharmaceutical company, said a number of drugs that inhibit
reproduction of the AIDS virus are being developed, most of which
work by blocking the action of reverse transcriptase.
   He said a drug that would block the action of the protease
enzyme could provide another weapon in the war on AIDS.
   Sharon Arnold of SmithKline Beckman Co. said scientists there
already are testing known protease blocking agents and that precise
description of the protease molecule would merely be a refinement
of what is already known.
   ``It would have been useful two or three years ago,'' she said.
``We've already been able to synthesize powerful protease
inhibitors.''
   The protease structure study was a cooperative effort by the
Frederick, Md., Center Research Facility of the National Cancer
Institute, led by Alexander Wlodawer, and by a California Institute
of Technology team led by Kent.
   A report on the study is published this week in Science, the
journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome disables the body's immune
system so it cannot resist infection. The HIV virus most often is
spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen
from infected people.
   As of June 30, AIDS had been diagnosed in 99,936 Americans, of
whom 58,014 have died since June 1, 1981, according to the Centers
for Disease Control. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

   Sen. Jesse Helms' effort to prevent federal
funding of sexually explicit artwork is being compared to
prohibitions against using tax dollars for racial or anti-Semitic
activities.
   Lawyer Bruce Fein found himself defending Helms and at odds with
a panel of art experts Thursday night at the Smithsonian
Institution's Hirshhorn Museum when he questioned the propriety of
using public funds for controversial art.
   He asked panel members how they would feel if the National
Endowment for the Arts gave $100,000 to David Dukes, the Louisiana
lawmaker with ties to the Ku Klux Klan, and ``he decided to make
nice crosses'' inscribed with the word ``nigger.''
   Helms, who was not at the forum, was outraged by two NEA grants
given to controversial artists whose work involves homosexual and
anti-religous themes.
   The North Carolina Republican is calling for a sweeping ban of
federal funding of material that is ``obscene or indecent'' or
``denigrates, debases, or reviles'' beliefs or people on the basis
of religion, race, creed, sex, handicap, age or national origin.
   Yale art historian Susan Casteras criticized Helms on Thursday
for wanting ``sanitized art'' while ``sweeping certain themes under
the carpet.''
   Fein argued that some may question the proper use of federal
funds to a neo-Nazi group that plans artwork splattered with
anti-Semitic symbols and slogans.
   The Helms amendment ``isn't an effort to censor, but to control
the type of symbols people wish to give,'' Fein said, adding that
the government must have input about how its money is used.
   The artists on the panel _ Casteras, former NEA member Richard
Andrews, New York artist Leon Golub and photographer David Joselet
_ insisted the government has no right to decide what is erotic or
immoral in the art world.
   Golub said homosexuals are American citizens and taxpayers who
have a right to have themselves expressed through art.
   The Senate has approved Helms' amendment as part of the NEA
budget and added a five-year ban on two art groups that sponsored
grants to photographers Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano.
   Mapplethorpe's photos have many lesbian and homosexual images,
while Serrano has a photograph that shows a crucifix submerged in
urine.
   The House reprimanded the NEA last month by cutting from its
proposed budget the exact amount of two grants that funded
Mapplethorpe and Serrano.
   A conference committee is scheduled to take up the $170 million
NEA budget the first week in September, and Helms already has been
lobbying members to keep his amendment in the final legislation.
   ``These are very complex issues we're talking about, the
possibility of censorship ... artists rights,'' said Andrews,
moderator of the forum.
   ``We need, all of us, whether politicians or individuals, to
resist oversimplication. It's the oversimplication that gives us
the most trouble in the long run.
   ``Seems to me in a way, good government is the ability to let
the representives take complex issues, reduce them to simple
thought and make judicious judgment but never losing sight of the
complexity of the overriding issues.
   ``Bad government to me is the ability to take complex issues,
turn them into simple building blocks and build a rickety
construction from that which has no basis in actual fact.''

   The military mission of space
shuttle Columbia soared on today under a shroud of secrecy briefly
breached when the secretary of the Air Force confirmed the
astronauts had released a satellite.
   Secretary Donald Rice's disclosure cracked a tight barrier of
concealment the Pentagon had placed around the flight since
Columbia was launched Tuesday from Cape Canaveral.
   The information blackout was in force today as the five
astronauts were believed to be monitoring research experiments and
testing their capabilities as military observers in space.
   The five-day flight is scheduled to end Sunday at Edwards Air
Force Base in California.
   Whether it was inadvertent or not, Rice told a small group of
reporters following a ceremony at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa,
``The United States now has a satellite in orbit as the result of a
very successful launch.''
   He made the statement Wednesday but it was not widely reported
until Thursday.
   ``I can say that was a very important day for the Air Force and
the nation's space program,'' Rice said when questioned about the
reported deployment of the satellite about seven hours after
liftoff Tuesday. ``We were extraordinarily pleased as were our
colleagues in NASA that everything went so well.''
   But asked about the satellite's purpose, Rice replied, ``I'm not
at liberty to say.''
   The payload was widely believed to be a powerful spy satellite
designed to snap highly detailed photographs of military targets
over a large area of the globe, including most of the Soviet Union.
It would help the United States verify Soviet compliance with arms
agreements.
   NASA plans to break the Pentagon-imposed silence Saturday with
an announcement of the exact landing time. The agency said earlier
it would occur between 9 a.m. and noon EDT.
   Otherwise, NASA released only the astronauts' menu. Air Force
Col. Brewster Shaw, Columbia's commander, ate hot dogs and beans
Thursday night.
   The pilot is Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, and the mission
specialists are Navy Cmdr. David Leestma, Army Lt. Col. James
Adamson and Air Force Maj. Mark Brown.

   Half of the sufferers of diabetes don't know they
have it, and the disease may contribute to as many as a
quarter-million American deaths each year, federal health officials
say.
   Diabetes was the underlying reported cause in 37,178 deaths in
the United States in 1986, the latest year for which final
statistics are available, the national Centers for Disease Control
said Thursday.
   Two reasons, the CDC said, lead researchers to believe that
diabetes is behind many more deaths than that. The disease was
listed as a contributory cause of death on four times as many death
certificates, while half the death certificates for people with the
non-insulin-dependent form of diabetes didn't mention the disease.
   ``Thus, diabetes may be associated with approximately eight
times as many deaths'' as indicated by the 37,178 reported _ or
about 297,000 deaths, the CDC said.
   Besides being potentially fatal, diabetes _ in which the body
can't properly handle sugars and starches _ also can cause kidney
disease, blindness and other serious complications.
   The CDC estimates that in 1986, 10.5 million Americans had
diabetes. The Atlanta-based agency said nearly half _ 4.9 million _
were undiagnosed cases in people who didn't know they were
diabetic. CDC researcher Dr. Robert Hahn said undiagnosed cases are
projected from surveys involving blood tests.
   The CDC said more than one in five diabetics have at least one
of three other conditions that can seriously affect their health:
smoking, high blood pressure and overweight.
   Twenty-seven percent of diabetics smoke, 47 percent have high
blood pressure and 22 percent are at least 30 percent overweight,
the CDC said. Researchers project that among diabetics, 39,000
deaths each year are attributed to the additional problem of
smoking, 30,000 are attributed to high blood pressure and 12,000
are attributed to obesity.
   Hahn said the highest additional risk for diabetics comes from
smoking.
   ``Among diabetics who smoke, the risk of dying (in a given year)
is 2.3 times higher than for diabetics who don't smoke,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Hahn said, death rates from diabetes have declined
slowly during the 1980s, from 15.9 such deaths per 100,000 people
in 1979 to 15.4 in 1986.
   In the 37,178 reported diabetes fatalities in 1986, the highest
rate was in Delaware, which reported 26.3 such deaths for every
100,000 population. The lowest was in Nevada, with a rate of 11.6
per 100,000.
   But geographic region was not necessarily a clue to diabetes
mortality rates: just north of Louisiana, second in the nation at
22.1, was Arkansas, 47th at 12.4.
   The CDC also reported Thursday that diabetes accounts for a
large number of ``end-stage'' kidney disease cases _ serious cases
which require dialysis or transplants in order for patients to live.
   Of 33,393 end-stage kidney disease cases reported to Medicare
officials in 1987, the CDC said, 28 percent were attributed to
diabetes.
   The agency noted that blacks, American Indians and
Mexican-Americans have diabetes end-stage kidney disease rates
between three and seven times higher than whites.

   Infants of mothers who used cocaine early in
pregnancy run a fivefold risk of urinary tract birth defects, and
the rate may be even higher, according to a new study from federal
health researchers.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
the risk of urinary tract defects was 4.8 times higher in children
of mothers reporting ``early pregnancy'' cocaine use _ at any point
from one month before pregnancy through the first trimester.
   ``This is the lowest end of the risk estimate; it might actually
be higher than that,'' said Dr. Jose Cordero, a CDC birth defects
specialist, noting that other studies have indicated that people
will not always admit cocaine use.
   The CDC said cocaine flows easily through the placenta and into
a fetus. ``The cocaine causes a decrease in the amount of blood
going to the baby ... and that decrease in blood flow leads to the
abnormalities,'' Cordero said.
   The CDC said the conclusion came from a survey looking at nearly
5,000 children born with birth defects in the Atlanta area between
1968-80, and interviews with the women involved.
   ``Women who report cocaine use early in pregnancy are at
increased risk for bearing infants with urinary tract anomalies,''
including malformed kidneys, the Atlanta-based CDC concluded.
   The Atlanta study compared the women who gave birth to children
with defects to mothers of children born without defects.
   Cordero said the risk of having a child with a urinary tract
defect was approximately 1.5 per 1,000 births. The risk among women
reporting early cocaine use, he said, was 4.8 times higher, or 7.2
per 1,000 births.
   The study also looked at cocaine use among mothers of children
with urinary tract defects, compared with cocaine use among mothers
of other children. Early pregnancy cocaine use was reported by 1.4
percent of the mothers of babies with urinary tract defects,
compared with 0.5 percent of the mothers of healthy children.
   Previous studies also had suggested a link between cocaine use
during pregnancy and birth defects in the genital organs, but
Cordero said the CDC study found no statistically significant
association there.
   The CDC noted that cocaine use in the United States ``has
increased substantially during the past decade.'' A 1985 report
estimated 1.1 million regular users of cocaine among women of
childbearing age.

   The youngest son of slain civil rights leader
Martin Luther King Jr. has resigned as president of the center that
carries his father's name amid talk of a rift among the leadership
over the center's direction.
   Dexter King's resignation was announced Thursday by the Martin
Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, but no reason
was given.
   Civil rights leaders in Atlanta said King stepped down because
of conflicts over fiscal and personnel concerns, and there were
reports of a rift between King and his mother, Coretta Scott King.
   Atlanta City Councilman Hosea Williams said the center was
encroaching on the leadership position in the civil rights movement
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which the elder
King founded.
   ``The center's purpose was to perpetuate the legacy of Dr. King,
but not to carry on the whole movement,'' said Williams, a former
lieutenant of the elder King. ``When they started talking about
leading the movement, freeing black folk, they started competing,
and both got hurt.''
   Mayor Andrew Young, who was an aide to the elder King in the
'60s, was quoted by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as saying the
resignation was part of a family dispute fueled by a generation gap.
   A King Center official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said Mrs. King might return to the presidency she relinquished to
her son.
   The King Center is a non-profit organization devoted to
education about King's teachings and philosophy. It also urges
action on international racial issues, especially apartheid in
South Africa, and is host to the annual Martin Luther King Jr.
birthday week celebration.
   The SCLC has taken an activist approach to the problems of
poverty and racism since it was founded in 1957 by King and the
Revs. Joseph Lowery, Ralph Abernathy and Fred Shuttlesworth.
   ``We are the activist arm of the movement,'' Lowery has said.
``When you do that, you step on toes and you don't become the most
popular kid on the block.''
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a follower of King in the 1960s and a
former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, said
in a telephone interview from Chicago that the two groups are
complementary rather than competitive.
   ``The fact that Dr. King remains a frame of reference for
justice is mainly that his work has been institutionalized,''
Jackson said, referring to the center.
   ``The SCLC's legacy (is) direct action, challenging the racism,
challenging anti-semitism,'' he added.
   Dexter King, 28, was elected in January to take over from his
mother, who remained as chief executive officer. He said he wanted
to cut the center's dependency on donations and put it on a solid
financial base so it could ``market and disseminate'' non-violent
teachings.
   King could not be reached at the office of his business,
Visionary Development Corp.
   In a statement from the King Center, board Chairman Jesse Hill
Jr. did not address the reasons for King's decision.
   ``It must be borne in mind that the changing circumstances,
staff and management changes and tragic assassinations have not
changed this eternal commitment to social change through creative
love and revolutionary non-violence,'' Hill wrote.
   The King Center, on Atlanta's historic Auburn Avenue, contains a
museum and Martin Luther King Jr.'s tomb.

   The nation's health officials are scrambling to
contain a 370 percent rise in the number of measles cases after
years in which the old childhood nemesis virtually disappeared as a
public health problem.
   More than 8,400 people have caught measles so far in 1989, and
as many as 25 have died, according to the national Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta.
   ``It's not really clear why. It's probably a variety of
things,'' said Dr. William Atkinson of the CDC.
   Lack of immunizations is playing a big part, especially in inner
city Hispanic and black neighborhoods, where many youngsters are
going without the measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations they should
receive starting at 15 months of age.
   ``We have to reach the parents and really convince them of the
importance of having the child vaccinated,'' Atkinson said
Wednesday. ``There are publicly funded clinics where children can
receive vaccines for little or no cost.''
   Even vaccinations aren't sure protection, however. Vaccinated
high schoolers and college students started falling sick with
measles early this year, prompting the American Academy of
Pediatrics to recommend in July that all Americans under 32 get
booster shots against the disease.
   The vaccine also fails to produce immunity in 5 percent of those
who receive it. Atkinson speculated that the unprotected population
may have reached a ``critical number'' this year, ripe for
outbreaks.
   ``The measles virus is so contagious, if one (infected) person
comes around, it will seek out the 5 percent who aren't immune,''
he said.
   Chicago is now coping with the worst outbreak _ 816 confirmed
cases by Wednesday and four of the state's six measles-related
deaths, said Atkinson and Dr. Richard M. Krieg, the city's acting
health commissioner.
   ``This disease is unique in terms of the efficiency with which
it is spread,'' said Krieg.
   The virus, which causes fever, runny nose and rash, is
transmitted through the air in tiny water droplets from the lungs
of an infected person.
   ``It can remain viable in the air for upwards of two hours,''
Krieg said. ``If someone in the room talks or coughs, the virus
seeks out all susceptible people. If they're not immune, they'll
get the measles.''
   Illinois has had 1,481 cases of measles this year, including an
outbreak at Bradley University in Peoria that hit 110 students,
according to Ralph March, immunization section chief of the
Illinois Department of Public Health.
   But that is still far less than the total of 3,000 cases and
nine deaths in Texas since last Thanksgiving, officials there said.
   ``Prior to the outbreak, we were having a nice, slow year, and
then it just hit the fan,'' said Wes Hodgson of the Texas
Department of Health in Austin.
   Outbreaks occurred at places like Texas Tech University in
Lubbock, where 300 students got sick, and high schoolers have
accounted for 24 percent of the cases, he said. Still, 37 percent
of those afflicted have been 4 years old or less, many in Houston,
he said.
   California also has been hard-hit, with about 900 cases in Los
Angeles, Atkinson said.
   Krieg said public-health officials in Chicago are using
``unprecedented'' strategies to try to reach the most affected
neighborhoods. They include sending immunization teams around to
public housing projects; giving 500,000 doses of vaccine to private
facilities to administer free; sending sound trucks out into the
neighborhoods; putting public-service announcements on minority
radio stations; vaccinating children at street festivals; and
giving flyers to grocery shoppers at 16 stores of one major chain.
   ``I know it will be another few weeks before we see the result
of our efforts,'' Krieg said.
   The nation's 8,479 cases as of Aug. 7 may be ``a drop in the
bucket'' compared to the 400,000 to 600,000 cases reported annually
before vaccine became available in 1963, Atkinson said. But this
year's number is 370 percent higher than a year ago and far above
the lows of 1,714 and 1,497 in 1982 and 1983, respectively, he said.
   ``We're trying to get it down and beat it, but it doesn't go
away easily,'' he said.

<HEAD>Four GOP Congressmen Donate to Garcia's Campaign</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ In an unusual show of bipartisanship, four
Republican congressmen have contributed to the re-election campaign
of embattled Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y.
   ``It defies logic,'' John Buckley, spokesman for the Republican
National Campaign Committee, said Thursday.
   The four Republicans _ all from New York _ gave $3,100 to the
campaign of Garcia, who is under indictment in the Wedtech bribery
scandal.
   Two of the four _ Reps. Benjamin Gilman of Middletown and Frank
Horton of Rochester _ serve with Garcia on the House Post Office
and Civil Service Committee. Gilman contributed $100 while Horton,
who is dean of the New York House delegation, gave $1,000.
   Republican Reps. Norman Lent of East Rockaway and Amo Houghton
of Corning both gave $1,000, according to Garcia's latest campaign
finance report filed with the Federal Election Commission.
   Garcia, of the Bronx, faces trial Sept. 11 on felony charges
that he and his wife, Jane, accepted bribes of cash and jewelry
worth $185,000 from the Wedtech Corp., a local military contractor.
Garcia's former House colleague, Mario Biaggi also of the Bronx,
was convicted last year of taking bribes from Wedtech and is
serving an eight-year sentence at a federal prison in Texas.

<NOTE>BAT Battle Concerns 200 Congressmen</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Master takeover engineer Sir James Goldsmith
has charged that congressional concern over his hostile bid for BAT
Industries PLC has been whipped up by ``a powerful multinational
tobacco conglomerate.''
   On Thursday it was disclosed that 209 members of the House and
Senate had written Secretary of State James A. Baker III asking him
to express their concern to the British government about the
multi-national leveraged buyout.
   ``Had any of them checked they would have easily ascertained
that the so-called `facts' alluded to in the letter are inaccurate
and misleading,'' said Goldsmith.
   Last month, the Anglo-French financier combined with British
merchant banker Jacob Rothschild and Australian investor Kerry
Packer to make an offer for BAT valued at some $21.6 billion.
   The cashless offer by Hoylake Investments Ltd. would be financed
mostly with borrowed money.
   BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, also has significant
interests in financial services, paper and retailing _ including
such U.S. holdings as the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field
department stores and Farmers Insurance Group.
   ``I am shocked that 200 people would sign a letter attacking us
without a single one of those people checking with us as to its
accuracy or validity,'' said Goldsmith in a statement issued in New
York.
   ``I can only conclude that this is the result of an intensive
lobbying campaign by a powerful multinational tobacco
conglomerate,'' he added, without elaboration.

   The public should be allowed to attend an Aug.
23 court session on the Iran-Contra criminal case against a former
CIA station chief, prosecutors say.
   In court papers, the office of independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh said Thursday the legal arguments before the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals may determine whether Joseph Fernandez will be put
on trial. Also at stake is the ability of Walsh's office to conduct
its work free from interference by the Justice Department, the
prosecutors' papers said.
   The Justice Department, over the objections of the independent
counsel, is taking legal questions concerning classified
information in the Fernandez case to the appeals court in Richmond,
Va.
   The independent counsel is objecting to the appeal, saying the
Justice Department's action in effect would wrest control of the
case from Walsh's office.
   The appeals court has scheduled a closed hearing.
   Fernandez, the spy agency's former station chief in Costa Rica,
is the highest ranking CIA officer ever indicted, associate
independent counsel Laurence Shtasel said in a nine-page brief.

<HEAD>Survivors Tell Of Desperate Battle For Life In Train Wreck</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUASAVE, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of survivors of a train wreck,
many bandaged and bruised, told of how they fought for their lives
when their passenger cars plunged into a river, killing 112 people.
   Red Cross officials said 239 people were injured, 39 seriously,
when the train bound from the beach resort of Mazatlan to Mexicali
near the U.S. border fell into the San Rafael River 15 miles south
of Guasave Wednesday.
   ``We had to push and pull as the cars filled with water,'' said
Felipe Rodriguez who was riding in one of the coaches.
   ``I found one of the girls, but ... '' he said almost sobbing in
a television interview Thursday night. Rodriguez lost his wife and
three daughters, ages 2 months and 7 and 12 years.
   No Americans were reported among the dead, said Dan Sainz, the
U.S. vice consul in Mazatlan. However, bodies were still being
found, he said.
   The second-class train, known as ``The Burro'' because it stops
at every station, fell into the river in northern Mexico before
dawn Wednesday when a bridge it was crossing collapsed.
   A week of the heaviest rains in 50 years had flooded large areas
of southern Sinloa state on the Pacific coast and a few hours
before the train passed a small dam three miles upstream broke.
   Federal Highways police said in a preliminary report the rain
had weakened the railbeds, causing the train to sway sharply. The
flood-battered narrow bridge, about 30 yards long, couldn't stand
the stress and caved in.
   Carlos Orozco Sosa, director of Mexican National Railways, told
reporters the bridge, made of steel and wood over concrete pylons,
had been inspected a month before and was found safe.
   He said 600 to 700 passengers were riding the 11-car Pacific
Railways train on its regular 700-mile run from Mazatlan to
Mexicali, across the border from Calexico, Calif. The line is part
of the government-owned rail system.
   Some victims were battered to death inside the cars by the
plunge. Others drowned and some were swept away by the muddy
churning waters of the river, which had overrun its banks.
   Some passengers died or became very sick after swallowing diesel
fuel that spilled into the river from the overturned engine.
Several suffered chemical burns from the fuel.
   Miriam Partida Santos, 17, whose 2-year-old daughter Cynthis
Anabel drowned, said it was so crowded that people were sleeping on
the floor.
   As the car she was in fell into the river, ``we hit the ceiling
and she drowned,'' Mrs. Partida said. ``I could hear her drowning
and you could hear the other people around drowning. We were
drowning and the windows were closed.''
   ``I felt it hit once and didn't pay any attention. It hit again
and it fell into the water. You could hear the cars falling,'' said
Gaudencio Carino, 33, who suffered a broken foot. ``I was not
asleep and conscious of everything, that's why I was able to get
out.''
   Many surviors stood on top of the cars in the middle of the
river, waiting until sunrise for help.
   Rescue was hampered by rain and flooding. By Thursday, however,
the floodwaters had receded and the level of the river was steadily
falling.
   Gov. Francisco Labastida Ochoa said 71 of the bodies identified
late Thursday were flown in two military Hercules transport planes
to their home states in Nayarit, Jalisco, Oaxada and Guanajuato.
All bodies identified so far were those of Mexicans.
   Relatives from many states crowded Guasave and Guamuchil,
another small town nearby where survivors and victims were taken.
   Labastida ordered free transportation for all relatives and
survivors back to their hometowns.
   The derailed cars were pulled out of the river by a crane and
work crews expect to rebuild the bridge and the tracks by Sunday.
But service will not resume before Wednesday, officials said.
   Three foreigners were known to have survived. Teresita Rubio at
Turismo Tagore here identified them only as two men and a woman
from Manchester, England, who came to her travel agency for help,
washed the mud off their clothes, got some food and headed for San
Diego by bus.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops Call For New Action Against Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Roman Catholic bishops said the
anti-abortion movement should seize the opportunity offered by a
recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to lobby state legislatures for
new limits on abortion.
   While charging that abortion rights advocates are apparently
trying to revive anti-Catholic sentiments, the Committee on
Pro-Life Activities of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
said Thursday the court ruling ``marks the beginning of a new
debate, in which many voices must be raised in defense of life.''
   The 1,500-word statement, called ``An Opportunity to Defend
Life,'' suggests opponents of legalized abortion concentrate on
such short-term goals at the state level as limiting government
funding of abortion; requiring parental notification and consent on
abortion for minors; restricting late-term abortions; and
installing other safeguards to ``prevent hasty or uninformed
consent'' to abortions.
   The statement by the bishops' committee headed by Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin of Chicago was a planning analysis following the
high court's July 3 ruling upholding a Missouri law that banned
abortions in public hospitals and stopped public employees from
counseling women about abortions. The decision stopped short of
overturning the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision under which women have
the right to seek abortions, but allowed states to impose new
restrictions.
   In their statement, the bishops made a special appeal for groups
opposing abortion to work together. The groups have been battling
over tactics such as whether to picket abortion clinics or to seek
a total or partial ban on abortion.
   ``The movement in support of abortion on demand is united in its
agenda; pro-life Americans must not give their adversaries an easy
victory by launching attacks on each other over questions of
political strategy,'' the bishops said.
   The committee said the new legislative situation also raises a
special problem involving hints of anti-Catholicism.
   Some ``accuse us of seeking indiscriminately to impose our moral
ideals on other Americans,'' the bishops said. That attitude
``would exclude us at the outset from this debate on the alleged
grounds that our opposition to abortion is motivated solely by
religious convictions.
   ``Anti-Catholic sentiment has never been entirely absent from
the pro-abortion campaign, but abortion-rights advocates apparently
seek to revivify it now that the efforts of Catholics and other
pro-life citizens have begun to bear fruit,'' the committee said.
   Nevertheless, the bishops said, ``we do not intend to be ruled
out of this or any social debate by spurious interpretations of the
First Amendment. We must continue to speak for those who cannot
speak for themselves, our unborn sisters and brothers.''
   Abortion Rights Mobilization, a coalition of groups favoring the
legal right to abortions, has sued the federal government to revoke
the church's tax exemption status because of its lobbying against
abortion.

   The dollar firmed against the yen Friday, while
stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange edged down.
   The dollar closed at 140.10 yen, up 1.05 yen from Thursday's
finish. It opened at 140.10 yen and moved between 139.87 yen and
140.20 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 139.47-point
loser on Thursday, dropped 6.84 points, or 0.02 percent, to close
at 34,712.96.
   Chemical Bank trader Minori Takeuchi said the dollar's gains at
the start of Tokyo trading followed a similar upswing in the market
in Sydney, Australia, where Japanese investors bought the dollar
before Tokyo opened.
   ``They bought the currency mainly for position adjustments
because many investors have sold the U.S. unit starting this
week,'' she said.
   Currently, the dollar is moving very little at a rate slightly
higher than 140 yen, as the majority of market players stepped off
to the sidelines ahead of a release of the U.S. producer price
index for July later Friday.
   ``Although the dollar has slowly climbed over the 140-yen mark,
demand for the currency is not strong enough to push it up
higher,'' Ms. Takeuchi said.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues regained 110.73 points, or 0.32 percent, to rise back to
34,830.53 within the first 15 minutes of trading. It had shed
139.47 points the previous day.
   Dealers said the index's recovery followed gains in the Dow
Jone's industrial average of 30 major issues in New York overnight,
where the index gained 26.55 points to end at 2,712.63, surpassing
the 2,700 level for the first time since August 1987.

   Police arrested four people as they continued to
unravel a bogus airline ticket ring that allegedly sold millions of
dollars of stolen tickets by advertising discounted fares in
national publications.
   ``Every major airline in the world is a victim in some
fashion,'' said Capt. Tim Black, head of the police organized crime
bureau. ``These individuals put together a major conspiracy by
knowing how to access airline computers to put travel itineraries
in the computer system.''
   Investigators believe at least $7 million in airline tickets
were stolen, some during burglaries of travel agencies, Black said.
   Arrested Thursday at their Phoenix-area homes were Jurgen Thomos
Steinmetz, 31; Rolf Grosse Heitmeyer, 37; his wife, Annedore Dore
Heitmeyer, 35; and Karl Heinz Bersuch, 37. Police said the
Heitmeyers and Bersuch are citizens of West Germany.
   They were booked into the Maricopa County Jail for investigation
of conducting an illegal enterprise, conspiracy to traffic in
stolen property trafficking in stolen property, felony theft, money
laundering and fraudulent schemes.
   Steinmetz was being held on $1 million bond, Bersuch on
$411,000, Rolf Heitmeyer on $343,000, and Mrs. Heitmeyer on
$274,000.
   Police also seized about $80,000 in cash, five vehicles, two
homes and their contents, all of which were believed to have been
purchased with the proceeds of the stolen-ticket operation, Black
said.
   Police said more arrests are possible.
   The operation was based in Phoenix, but also had offices in
Honolulu and Frankfurt, West Germany, police said. They would not
say whether any of those arrested had worked for an airline.
   Police became aware of the operation in June after a Los Angeles
woman called to complain about a discount airline ticket she had
purchased from a Phoenix travel agency that had advertised in a
national publication. The undisclosed airline had rejected her
ticket because it was listed as stolen.
   The ads offered ``guaranteed lowest fares'' on international
destinations, including Concorde flights, and listed a toll-free
number.
   A majority of the tickets apparently were accepted by the
airlines, Black said.
   An initial investigation in June resulted in the arrests of two
Phoenix-area men _ Prem Singh, 42, and Vijayant Shishodia _ and the
seizure of $50,000 in cash.
   Singh remained in the county jail Thursday under $137,000 bond,
officials said. He is charged with fraudulent schemes and is
scheduled for a pre-trial conference on Aug. 31 in Maricopa County
Superior Court.
   Shishodia has been released from jail and his status was not
known, officials said.
   Black said the ticket operations continued as ``strong as ever''
after Shishodia and Singh were arrested.

   Actor John Newton, who portrayed
television's Superboy but had real-life problems with traffic cops,
is hanging up his cape.
   The Superboy syndicated television series begins its second year
of production Monday with a new actor who will replace Newton,
officials said.
   Newton played a college student who becomes the boy of steel to
assist the downtrodden, like his father, Superman. Executive
Producer Ilya Salkind on Thursday introduced Gerard Christopher as
the new Superboy.
   Newton had contractual and professional differences with Salkind
and Viacom Enterprises, the distributors of the TV series,
officials said.
   Newton was not entirely truthful with the sheriff and a judge in
Orlando when he convinced them to tear up a traffic ticket earlier
this year. He told them he had no other traffic violations and that
his Superboy image would be hurt if a careless-driving citation was
allowed to stand.
   Later, it turned out that Newton had at least four other traffic
tickets and his driver's license had been suspended twice since
1982.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Nikkei Edges Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen today,
while stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange edged down.
   The dollar closed at 140.10 yen, up 1.05 yen from Thursday's
finish. It opened at 140.10 yen and ranged between 139.87 yen and
140.20 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 139.47-point
loser Thursday, again shed 6.84 points, or 0.02 percent, closing at
34,712.96.
   The stock exchange's main barometer regained more than 100
points in slow, early morning trading, but softened afterward.
   Satoru Nagayoshi, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co., said
the downturn began as market players started selling for
profit-taking after the early gains that followed an overnight jump
in New York.
   ``Initiated by high-tech issues, prices were falling constantly
shortly after the early rise,'' he said.
   The market was quiet throughout the day because many investors
were taking summer vacations. Nomura Securities estimated the day's
volume at 500 million shares, or about half the daily average of 1
billion.
   The dollar firmed, hovering near 140.00 yen in relatively quiet
dealings.
   Chemical Bank trader Minori Takeuchi said the dollar's gain
followed a similar upswing in Sydney, where Japanese investors
bought the dollar before the Tokyo Foreign Exchange market opened.
   Another trader at a commercial bank in Tokyo said Japanese
investors were buying the dollar out of the expectation that an
increase in the U.S. producer price index for July would be larger.

<HEAD>New Prime Minister Denies Having Illegitimate Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
  Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, chosen to restore
credibility to his scandal-plagued governing party, today said an
unsubstantiated report that he fathered an illegitimate child was
untrue.
   Kaifu told reporters he has asked the Nagoya Times to apologize
and publish a retraction.
   ``I was very surprised. It's groundless,'' the 58-year-old prime
minister said when asked about the report at a news conference.
   The report was published last week in the daily newspaper when
Kaifu emerged as the main candidate to replace Sousuke Uno, who was
accused of keeping mistresses.
   On Thursday, the day Kaifu's Cabinet was sworn in, a weekly
magazine published an article saying it had looked into the report
an illegitimate child and was unable to substantiate it.
   But the article in the Shukan Post magazine recounted the
allegation in detail, and the issue was advertised in major
newspapers.
   Neither the Nagoya Times nor the Shukan Post identified the
woman who purportedly had a child by Kaifu, who is married with two
grown children. The Shukan Post said it had found the woman and her
husband in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island, and that
they had refuted the rumor.
   A Nagoya Times editorial staff member, Hideo Nagasaka, told The
Associated Press by phone that Kaifu's secretary had called this
morning to protest the story and ask for a retraction.
   But the newspaper was still looking into the allegation and
would not immediately comply with Kaifu's demand for a retraction,
Nagasaka said.
   The paper's story quoted unidentified political adversaries of
Kaifu as saying a woman in Hokkaido had a daughter by Kaifu about
20 years ago.
   As happened when allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced
against Uno, the story began to get wider attention in Japan after
some foreign media reported that Kaifu's morals were under attack
in the Japanese media.
   In Uno's case, the weekly Sunday Mainichi published a detailed
interview with an unidentified former geisha who said Uno had paid
her to be his mistress, then mistreated her. The allegation was not
reported in the major national newspapers or on television until it
had been published abroad several days later.
   An opposition lawmaker embarrassed Uno by asking him in
Parliament if he was suitable to represent Japan abroad when his
morality was under fire.
   The identity of the former geisha later was revealed when she
was interviewed on television and repeated her criticism of Uno's
character. The scandal contributed to his short-lived tenure as
prime minister.
   Kaifu has promised to carry out political reforms to help his
Liberal Democratic Party overcome the legacy of an influence-buying
scandal that forced Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, to leave
office June 2.
   Uno then took over as prime minister but announced he would
resign the day after the Liberal Democratics took a beating in the
July 23 election in the upper house of Parliament.
   That set off a search for a replacement, and Kaifu was chosen to
try to restore the Liberal Democrats' popularity.

<HEAD>Panamanian Bank to Plead Guilty to Money Laundering, Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Panamanian bank agreed to plead guilty to
laundering drug money and pay a $5 million penalty in the largest
money-laundering conviction ever obtained by the federal government
against a bank, an official said.
   U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr said Thursday the Panamanian
subsidiary of Banco de Occidente has agreed to enter the guilty
plea during a hearing in federal court in Atlanta Monday.
   He said the bank will pay the first $2 million of the $5 million
fine during the hearing.
   ``According to our information, the net worth of the bank is
$6.7 million, so this is a very substantial penalty in terms of net
worth,'' Barr said.
   The plea comes after federal authorities announced the
completion of ``Operation Polar Cap'' in March, which Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh called ``the largest money-laundering
crackdown ever carried out by the federal government.''
   Undercover agents broke up a Los Angeles-based operation known
as La Mina, which agents said had laundered $1.2 billion in drug
proceeds in several U.S. cities in the past two years.
   Thornburgh said the operation was linked to Colombia's Medellin
drug cartel, which purportedly accounts for 80 percent of the
cocaine entering the United States.
   The government seized half a ton of cocaine and $45 million in
cash, jewels and real estate in the investigation.
   It also filed civil actions in an effort to seize $412 million
more in U.S. assets of two banks, Banco de Occidente of Panama and
Banco de Occidente of Colombia, that allegedly agreed to receive
wire transfers of the laundered money.
   Barr said in a telephone interview late Thursday that the
investigation and subsequent guilty plea marked the ``first time we
were able to identify accounts and the so-called money pipeline for
the Medellin Cartel.''
   Barr said Banco de Occidente was indicted in Atlanta. Agents
discovered the network while operating a money-laundering
``storefront'' scheme in Atlanta.
   Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator John Lawn said after the
operation that when La Mina was forced out of business, agents
operating the storefront scheme in Atlanta laundered $4 million in
three days, illustrating the size of the Los Angeles operation.
   Barr said officials had to pursue a plea agreement with Banco de
Occidente before Monday's hearing to release some of the bank's
frozen assets so the bank could pay the initial $2 million of its
penalty.
   The case is significant, Barr said, because federal officials
are pursuing the defendants under the Substitute Asset Provisions
Act.
   ``That statute allows us to seek forfeiture of funds even though
each and every dollar is not directly traceable to a drug
transaction and substitute assets can be seized,'' Barr said.

<HEAD>Eight Northeastern States Set Tougher Emission Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials in eight northeastern states said
President Bush's proposed revisions to the federal Clean Air Act
would not do enough to cut auto emissions, prompting them to agree
on their own standards.
   The agreement Thursday by the six New England states, New York
and New Jersey means that more than a third of the nation's cars
may be covered by tougher emission standards.
   Massachusetts Environmental Secretary John DeVillars said that
the price of the auto emissions equipment would be $100 to $150 per
car.
   ``The price of not cleaning up our air is far, far higher,'' he
said.
   The eight states followed California's lead by agreeing to
require improved air pollution control equipment and new emission
monitoring devices on cars beginning with the 1993 model year.
   The group of states _ calling itself the Northeast States for
Coordinated Air Use Management, or NESCAUM _ represents about
one-fourth of the national automobile market. Combined with
California, 38 percent of the nation's cars would be covered by
tougher emission standards.
   Before the new regulations take effect, state legislatures in
New York, Maine and New Hampshire must approve the changes, NESCAUM
officials said.
   Ford Motor Co. emissions expert Kelly Brown said the industry
was cooperating with NESCAUM.
   Many new cars on the road today already meet the tougher
standards for emissions of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxide and carbon
monoxide, according to Bruce Maillet, director of the Massachusetts
Division of Air Quality Control.
   But the California regulations and those proposed for the
Northeast would require that cars meet the new standards for the
first 100,000 miles they are on the road, instead of 50,000 miles
as proposed by Bush.
   All cars made in 1993 and thereafter would have to undergo
emissions inspections on the assembly line instead of merely a
sampling of cars. And each car would carry an emission monitoring
device that would alert the driver via a dashboard light when
emission control equipment was malfunctioning.
   By the year 2010 virtually all cars on the roads in the
Northeast would carry the equipment, under the agreement.
   The hydrocarbons from motor vehicle exhaust and oxides of
nitrogen undergo a chemical reaction in the presence of sunlight to
form ozone smog, which can irritate the eyes and lungs. Pregnant
women, children, the elderly and asthma sufferers are particularly
vulnerable.

<HEAD>Walkout Continues in Estonia Despite Anti-Strike Decree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at about 24 Estonian factories and firms
defied a government decree today and stayed off the job to protest
a law they say discriminates against Russians and other migrants,
local journalists said.
   Sulev Hailik, a journalist with state-run Estonian radio, said
enterprises in the small Soviet republic on the Baltic Sea were hit
by walkouts for a third day, but that employees at some other
factories, including the Volta machine-building plant, had returned
to work.
   A representative for the strikers claimed the walkout had spread
to 42 enterprises and that the government measures taken to halt
the walkout had only strengthened workers' resolve.
   The Estonian Supreme Soviet Presidium, the government's top
executive body, issued a decree Thursday night ordering an
immediate end to the walkout and instructing the Council of
Ministers, or local government cabinet, to ensure the uninterrupted
functioning of the economy.
   That decree did not specify how workers who continued to strike
would be punished, mentioning only vague ``administrative and
criminal measures'' and the drafting of a tougher law on strikes.
   ``They want to threaten us but it won't work,'' a member of the
strike committee said in a telephone interview from Estonia's
capital Tallinn this morning. ``The strike will be continued.''
   The organizer, who refused to give his name, said strikers were
refusing to talk to Estonian officials, and would deal only with
Moscow. The committee on Wednesday sent four representatives to the
Soviet capital to seek a meeting with Vice President Anatoly I.
Lukyanov.
   The protest by non-Estonians was sparked by a new law passed by
the Estonian parliament Tuesday that tightens residency
requirements for voting and holding elected office.
   Non-Estonian residents of the republic, including leaders of the
Russian-dominated InterMovement group, complained the law is aimed
at them because many are new arrivals and launched a protest strike
the day following its passage.
   On Thursday the walkout spread and included as many as 20,000
workers, said Maarika Saarna, an editor at Estonian Radio.
   Hailik said it was not immediately known how many workers were
off the job today, and the strike committee representative said he
had no idea. ``We do not know how many people work at various
enterprises,'' he said.
   On Thursday, strike committee member Artur Kopykin claimed 37
enterprises were affected. On Wednesday, the strike's first day, 22
enterprises were reported on strike, including shipyards and a
motor works.
   Under the new election law, residents of Estonia must live in
the same district for at least two years, or have lived anywhere in
the republic for a total of five years, to be able to vote.
   Candidates for elective office must live in the same place for
five years, or in Estonia for 10 years.
   Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the
population, and pushed for the law to protect themselves from an
influx of Russians and members of other Soviet ethnic groups.

   After a Trump Shuttle jet made an emergency
landing without its front gear, owner Donald Trump flew to Boston
to thank the pilot and try to turn a near-disaster into a public
relations triumph.
   ``I think the whole crew is made up of heroes,'' the New York
real estate baron said, singling out Capt. Robert Smith as ``a
great talent.''
   There were no injuries among the 47 passengers and seven crew
members on the Boeing 727, which came screeching into Logan
International Airport on its belly Thursday morning and stopped in
a shower of sparks.
   Smith, 47, a former Navy pilot with 19 years of flying
experience, realized the plane's nose gear failed to extend as he
approached Logan from New York City at about 9:30 a.m.
   He tried to free the landing gear by diving and pulling up
suddenly, and then by making a rough touch-and-go landing _
slamming the main landing gear on the runway and then taking off.
   When both attempts failed, the jet circled for nearly an hour
and dumped fuel over the ocean before finally making a gentle but
ungainly landing, with its nose scraping the pavement.
   Smith played down his efforts. ``This was all in a day's work as
far as I'm concerned,'' he said.
   The emergency landing was the first major problem for Trump
since he bought the shuttle from strike-torn Eastern Airlines on
June 8. He quickly tried to turn any safety fears to his advantage.
   ``I think the public confidence might be greater right now,
because of the talent of our crews,'' Trump said.
   The landing resembled an Aug. 2 incident in which a Piedmont
Airlines 737 scraped its wing and engine in an emergency landing at
Greensboro, N.C., after its left main gear jammed. No one was
injured.
   Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle, said the jet had been
in service since January 1970 and was scheduled for a major
overhaul next month.
   ``Age has nothing to do with it,'' Nobles said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board was investigating the
incident.

   A couple who wanted to have a test-tube baby
but now are considering a divorce may donate their frozen,
fertilized egg to another couple, their doctor says.
   ``It's a tough situation,'' said Dr. O'Dell Owens, head of an in
vitro fertilization clinic in Cincinnati. ``They're probably going
to donate the egg. That's what we've encouraged them to do.''
   The egg was frozen after the couple came to Owens for help in
conceiving a child more than a year ago, he said. Owens declined to
disclose their names.
   Terri Hornbach, a spokeswoman at the private Christ Hospital,
where the egg is in storage, also refused to identify the couple.
   Donation could prevent any possibility of the kind of battle
taking place in Maryville, Tenn. Junior Davis is suing his wife,
Mary Sue, for divorce and is asking the court to prevent her from
using any of their seven frozen embryos.
   As a result of the Tennessee case and his experience with the
Cincinnati-area couple, Owens said he plans to draft an agreement
that would give the clinic permission to anonymously donate a
couple's eggs in the event of divorce or death.
   Through the in vitro process, eggs are fertilized outside the
body in a laboratory dish and later implanted in the womb.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino will visit
the United States in November for talks that are expected to
include debt relief and the future of American military bases here,
it was announced today.
   A statement from the presidential press office said Mrs. Aquino
will arrive in the United States Nov. 9, but gave no length for the
visit. Presidential spokeswoman Deedee Sytangco said Mrs. Aquino
would visit Canada before traveling to the United States but that
the schedule had not been completed.
   ``President Corazon Aquino has accepted the invitation of
President Bush to make a state visit,'' the statement said.
   Mrs. Aquino last visited the United States in September 1986,
seven months after she took power in the popular uprising that
toppled President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The November visit was announced following a meeting between
Mrs. Aquino and a three-member delegation from the U.S. House of
Representatives.
   ``We discussed her coming to the United States,'' said the
delegation's leader, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo. ``We're very
excited that she's coming, and we want to make her visit very
successful. She's very nice to us.''
   Major issues facing the two countries include the Philippines'
nearly $30 billion foreign debt and the future of the six U.S.
military bases, whose lease expires in 1991.
   U.S. officials have said the Philippines probably would become
the second country after Mexico to benefit from American strategy
for reducing the debt burden of developing nations.
   But some Filipino officials believe the country should forego
debt reduction in favor of increased borrowing because of the
country's economic growth potential.
   The United States and the Philippines are expected to begin
talks later this year on whether to extend U.S. military base
operations beyond 1991. Any agreement would require two-thirds
approval of the 23-member Philippine Senate, where anti-base
sentiment is strong.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to say whether she supports keeping the
bases. She said this week that she may wait until September of next
year before informing Washington of her decision.

<TEXT>
   In a sort of U.S.-Soviet peace corps
exchange, Soviet carpenters are helping Americans build four new
homes and a day care center to benefit low-income farmworkers.
   It's the Soviets' way of thanking U.S. construction crews who
helped rebuild Soviet Armenia after a devastating earthquake.
   Farmworkers Martin and Esperanza Chavarin, and their seven
children, will get a new house. So will Ramon and Esther Jiron and
their four children.
   The Southeast Yakima Community Center will get a new day care to
house 50 children, nearly all from poor families.
   Ten Soviets and 10 Americans, working as the U.S.-Soviet
Partners Project, plan to spend the next month building the
structures.
   The project began this week in the Yakima Valley, a farming
region of central Washington where migrant farmers arrive each
summer to pick cherries, apples and other fruit.
   ``Nothing like this was possible three years ago,'' said Farit
Mukhametshin, 42, of Moscow, an official of the Soviet Peace Fund
and student at the USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
   ``My hope is if the operation is continued the social life of
both countries is improved and there can be feedback,'' he said.
   ``I never thought I would see Soviet citizens building a day
care center in southeast Yakima,'' said John Everhart, interim
director of the center.
   While project leaders like to discuss their work as raising
walls to bring down barriers between the two peoples, some involved
have more basic goals.
   ``I love to help poor people everywhere,'' said Margarita
Gopshtein, 45, head of foreign languages at the Pedagogical
Institute in Tashkent.
   ``I didn't want to come here just as a tourist. I wanted to do
something,'' said Ms. Gopshtein, as she helped haul boards on a
90-degree day this week.
   Ms. Gopshtein, who began learning English at age 17, also is
serving as interpreter for the group. Most do not speak English.
   Everhart said the day care center would have cost $50,000 with
labor costs, but will cost only $14,000 because the center only has
to buy materials.
   The Soviets, whose expenses are paid by the Moscow-based Soviet
Peace Fund, are also learning about the United States.
   ``My major goal is to study American culture,'' said Dimitry
Kiselyov, 24, of Leningrad, a business student eager to meet with
U.S. bankers. ``I want to visit Wall Street in New York, the stock
exchange and a lecture in a university.''
   The group will be traveling to New York and Washington, D.C., at
the end of their six-week stay in the United States.
   The Soviets are staying at a working farm used by the
Presbyterian Church as a small convention center. They live in a
dormitory in an idyllic setting surrounded by fruit trees and
animals.
   Meals are prepared for them and the visitors so far have sampled
barbecued hamburgers, stir-fried chicken, pancakes and Mexican
food, said Barbara Gilbert, director at The Campbell Farm.
   Later they will try traditional Yakima Indian fare, she said.
   ``Quite a lot of them like to eat meat,'' Ms. Gilbert said,
noting that some members of the group complained initially that
their diet did not have enough meat.
   ``I had a request for liver for breakfast,'' she said. ``We
haven't done that yet.''

<TEXT>
   Felix Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspected of
spying for the Soviet Union, admits being in Paris the day he
reportedly met a Soviet agent in a restaurant and left a briefcase
for him under the table.
   In an on-camera interview with the Washington correspondent of
Austrian Television, Bloch declined to say whether he dined in
Paris with the suspected Soviet agent or whether he left a
briefcase for him, according to the journalist who conducted the
interview.
   The interview, which was videotaped Thursday for broadcast today
in Vienna, was the first time Bloch has answered questions on the
allegations against him. But he maintained the pattern of his
contacts with reporters over the past two weeks _ offering
tantalizing glimpses but failing to shed much light on the
much-publicized case.
   The Austrian-born Bloch, 54, was suspended from his State
Department job June 22 but no charges have been brought against
him. He has been under close FBI surveillance as the investigation
against him continues, and in recent days has been leading a convoy
of reporters and photographers on jaunts through Washington and its
suburbs.
   Bloch first accepted an invitation to visit the offices of
state-run Austrian TV 10 days ago, but at the time he only chatted
with the correspondent but refused to be interviewed.
   On Thursday, he agreed to visit again and sat for a 15-minute
interview, said correspondent Robert Wiesner.
   ``We started off talking about Vienna, the cemeteries there, and
tombstones,'' said Wiesner, describing Bloch as relaxed.
   Bloch was posted at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna from 1980 to
1987, and for four of those years served as the deputy chief of
mission.
   Then, Wiesner said, he asked Bloch whether he had been in Paris
on May 14. ``Bloch thought for a long time, then said, `yes,'''
Wiesner said, translating the interview which was conducted in
German.
   Sources here have said suspicions about the U.S. diplomat arose
when the United States intercepted a telephone call on May 14 to
Bloch in Washington from a man under surveillance in Paris who
called himself Pierre. The two men set up a meeting in Paris, and
the United States asked French intelligence to monitor it, the
sources said.
   But ABC News reported last week that May 14 was the day Bloch
arrived in Paris from New York and met his contact for dinner,
leaving his briefcase under the table to be picked up by the
suspected Soviet agent.
   Austrian police authorities said they were told by the United
States that the suspected Soviet contact posed as a Finnish
computer salesman. ABC said he traveled with a Finnish passport in
the name of Reino Gikman.
   According to U.S. sources, Bloch has said he only knew the man
as a stamp collector.
   ``Did you meet a gentleman by the name of Reino Gikman?''
Wiesner said he asked Bloch.
   ``I can't answer that question,'' Bloch responded.
   ``Did you go to a restaurant and meet a gentleman and leave a
briefcase?'' Wiesner asked.
   ``I was in a restaurant and I enjoyed the food very much and
there were a lot of people there,'' Bloch reportedly responded.
   ABC identified the restaurant as being in the plush Meurice
Hotel.
   ``Are you missing a briefcase?'' Wiesner said he asked. He said
Bloch paused for a long time and then answered, ``No.''
   Asked whether the allegations that he spied for the Soviets were
true, Bloch declined to comment, Wiesner said.

<HEAD>Moslem Fundamentalist Leader Detained Despite Court Release</HEAD>

   Authorities invoked emergency regulations to
continue holding a blind Moslem fundamentalist cleric and his
followers on charges of anti-government activity, a government
source said today.
   A judge had ordered the release of Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman and
the 23 other defendants behind bars. But the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Interior Minister Zaki Badr cited a
1981 emergency law to keep them locked up.
   Abdel-Rahman, a former religion professor, twice was acquitted
of charges linked to the assassination by Moslem extremists of
President Anwar Sadat on Oct. 6, 1981.
   That event that led to the emergency law, which gives police
broad powers of search and arrest without charge and bans
unauthorized demonstrations and strikes.
   In its fight against violence-prone extremists seeking immediate
implementation of Islamic law, the government previously has used
the emergency law to justify continued detention of fundamentalists
freed by courts during trial.
   Mohammed Kamal Samaha, president of the three-member security
court that opened the current trial Sunday, ordered Abdel-Rahman
and the others freed on Thursday and adjourned hearings until
October. He set no bail and gave no reasons for the release order.
   As he read it, shouts of ``long live justice!'' rose from the
defendants' cage and spectators' section in the courtroom, a
converted former exhibition hall in a state fairground.
   But the leading government-owned Cairo newspaper, Al-Ahram,
reported that Interior Minister Badr immediately issued new arrest
orders because the defendants are ``dangerous to public order.''
   The current trial involves 54 defendants, but only 25 were in
custody.
   Charges in the case stem from an April 7 demonstration by
fundamentalists led by Abdel-Rahman in the southern city of Fayoum,
his hometown.
   The cleric and the others face charges of illegal possession of
weapons, attempting to kill a police officer and assault on people
and public property. Conviction can be punishable by death.
   Police rounded up about 1,500 fundamentalists in a nationwide
crackdown after the Fayoum demonstration.
   Abdel-Rahman, former professor of theology at Assiut University,
was tried and acquitted on charges he inspired Sadat's
assassination. In a subsequent trial, he was acquitted of charges
he instigated a coup attempt after Sadat's slaying.
   In both cases, the prosecution said Abdel-Rahman was the
spiritual leader of an underground anti-government group called
Jihad, or ``Holy War,'' that was dedicated to the overthrow of the
government.

   A suspect in a four-state murder spree
confessed to killing a convenience store clerk, and said he had
been using cocaine heavily the month before the shooting.
   In an emotional confession, Gregg Francis Braun, 28, admitted
killing Geraldine Valdez on July 23 during a preliminary hearing
Thursday to determine if there was enough evidence to charge him in
state district court.
   Braun testified that he had been undergoing psychological
counseling in his home town of Garden City, Kan., since June for
recurring violent dreams, and that recent, heavy use of cocaine
worsened a lifelong violent tendency.
   He told the court he had been having more and more bad dreams,
``dreams of killing people.''
   A weapons expert testified that a .25-caliber handgun seized
from Braun, which he admitted using to kill Mrs. Valdez, is
apparently the same weapon used in the killings last month of two
people in Kansas and one in Texas.
   Braun also has been identified as a suspect in the shooting
death of flower shop clerk Gwen Miller and the wounding of two
other women in Ardmore, Okla., on July 21.
   All of the killings were similar: The victims were shop clerks
and were shot in the back of the head with a .25-caliber pistol.
   Braun, jailed here in lieu of $1 million bond, was held for
trial on charges of first-degree murder and second-degree armed
robbery. He will be arraigned before a district judge within 20
days, said Assistant District Attorney Leslie Skinner.
   Ms. Skinner said she would seek the death penalty.
   Assistant Public Defender Stephen Aarons said Braun has no
previous felony convictions, was impaired and unable to appreciate
the criminality of his action and was cooperative with authorities.
   Asked first by Aarons and later by Skinner whether he denied
killing Mrs. Valdez, Braun said, ``No, I don't deny it.''
   He also admitted stealing about $200 from J&amp;T Mini-Mart, a
combination store and gas station where Mrs. Valdez worked in
Springer, 100 miles northeast of Santa Fe.
   Larry Warehime, a firearms examiner for the state Department of
Public Safety, said tests showed the bullets taken from Mrs.
Valdez's body and other casings found in the store were fired from
Braun's gun.
   Warehime said similar tests indicated the gun was the same one
used in the Texas and Kansas shootings.
   Authorities in Kansas have charged Braun with the separate
murders of two Garden City convenience store clerks, Barbara
Kochendorfer and Mary Rains, on July 19. Prosecutors in Texas this
week charged Braun with the murder of photo shop owner Edley Perry
Spurrier in Pampa on July 20.

   A federal judge has denied former U.S. Rep. Pat
Swindall's motion to overturn his conviction or to get a new trial.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Freeman rejected Swindall's
arguments that his conviction on nine counts of lying to a federal
grand jury should be thrown out. Swindall, a Republican, cited
pre-trial publicity and argued that a statement by a prosecutor
improperly focused attention on Swindall's failure to testify.
   The perjury conviction was related to Swindall's grand jury
testimony on negotiations for an $850,000 home loan from an
undercover agent posing as a money launderer.
   Swindall, who lost his 4th District seat to former actor Ben
Jones last November while under indictment on the charges, is to be
sentenced by Freeman on Aug. 28.

<HEAD>Study: Crush of AIDS Patients in Public Hospitals Causing Economic
Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRIS CHANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government should take emergency
measures to help big-city public hospitals that are losing money
treating AIDS patients, researchers said.
   Scientists from the National Public Health and Hospital
Institute in Washington, D.C., surveyed 623 hospitals in 1987 and
found that AIDS patients are concentrated in major city hospitals,
causing serious financial loss, according to a study published in
today's edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The study said the average cost for in-patient care of an AIDS
victim was $681 a day, while the average revenue the hospital
received for such care was $545 a day.
   ``These hospitals are losing large amounts of money. It's eating
into their bottom line,'' Virginia Weslowski, one of the
researchers, said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   The federal government could give the financially troubled
hospitals emergency grants and put more money into Medicaid for
AIDS patients, said Dennis Andrulis, principal researcher of the
study.
   Ms. Weslowski said the government could ease the burden on the
hospitals by allowing more patients to qualify for Medicaid.
   The researchers found that the burden of caring for AIDS
patients falls on only a few public hospitals in cities like New
York, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas and Miami.
   Less than 5 percent of U.S. hospitals treat more than 50 percent
of all AIDS cases, the study found.
   For every dollar public hospitals spend on AIDS outpatients, the
hospitals get back only 14 cents, Andrulis said.
   If an AIDS patient is not covered by Medicaid or health
insurance, public hospitals must swallow the costs themselves, he
said.
   ``This will overwhelm the hospitals and hurt the quality of care
for the other patients,'' Ms. Weslowski said.
   She added that public hospitals are especially hard hit by the
deadly disease because they attract heavy concentrations of poor
victims, many of them inner-city drug abusers.
   On the average, public hospitals treated more than twice as many
AIDS patients as private hospitals, researchers found. They also
treated the largest proportions of low-income AIDs patients across
all regions.
   Even middle- or upper-middle-class AIDS patients can end up in
public hospitals when they are unable to work, deplete or lose
insurance benefits and and have used up their financial resources
trying to cover medical costs, Ms. Weslowski said.
   Anne Scitovsky, chief of the economics division of the Palo Alto
Medical Foundation in California, blamed the problem on the
nation's ``inadequate health insurance system.''
   An estimated 37 million Americans have no health insurance, she
said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a fatal, incurable
disease that cripples the body's defenses, leaving a person prey to
life-threatening infections and certain cancers. The syndrome is
spread by a virus that is spread mainly through sexual intercourse,
shared hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their
infants before or during birth.
   By June 30, AIDS had stricken more than 99,936 people in the
United States since 1979 and killed more than 58,014 of them,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

   Thunderstorms brought more rain to already saturated ground in
the West today after downpours at Yellowstone National Park created
dangerous mudslides and flash flooding in California prompted
evacuations.
   Rain also fell on portions of the East Coast and widely
scattered thunderstorms developed over the Great Plains.
   Thunderstorms stirred Thursday afternoon along the Nevada and
California border, in areas that were experiencing runoff problems
from Wednesday's rain. In Mono County, Calif., most of the main
roads were either closed or cars had to be escorted.
   Persistent thunderstorms forced a debris-clogged stretch of the
Los Angeles Aqueduct to overflow, while flash flooding prompted
evacuations, stranded motorists and damaged homes, crop land and
highways across a wide swath of Southern California.
   The widely scattered downpours of Wednesday and Thursday deluged
cities throughout San Diego, Imperial, San Bernardino, Riverside,
Mono and Inyo counties, as well as Arizona's Yuma County and
Nevada's Clark County.
   At Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., three people trapped in a
camper were rescued seconds before their vehicle was pulled under a
mudslide Thursday evening, park officials said.
   ``It was a matter of seconds, virtually seconds, and that
vehicle would have gone under,'' said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo
after talking to a park ranger who rescued the family visiting from
Mexico.
   Elsewhere, widely scattered thunderstorms rumbled across the
northern Rockies, the Dakotas, Wisconsin and parts of southern
Oklahoma and northern Texas today.
   Rain hit the middle and south Atlantic coastal states, and
thunderstorms were along the central Gulf Coast. A thunderstorm
produced wind gusts to 58 mph at Pensacola, Fla., Thursday night.
   Clear skies prevailed this morning over the Ohio Valley, much of
the Mississippi Valley, the Pacific Northwest, much of California
and parts of Texas.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
over much of the East Coast, the Appalachians, the upper Ohio
Valley and portions of the Great Lakes; numerous showers and
thunderstorms from eastern New York across the middle and south
Atlantic coastal states to central Florida; scattered thunderstorms
over the Plateau region, much of the Rockies, and northern and
western portions of Texas; and numerous showers and thunderstorms
over much of Arizona and New Mexico.
   Temperatures were forecast to be in the 70s along much of the
East Coast; in the 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast; into the
lower 90s across the Florida peninsula, and over much of the
northern Plains; above 90 degrees from southern Texas across much
of New Mexico and southern Arizona to the interior valleys of
California; from 100 to 105 degrees in the Desert Southwest; and in
the 80s throughout the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 50 degrees at Yellowstone
National Park, Wyo., and Quillayute, Wash., to 87 degrees at
Phoenix.

   Dazed civilians stumbled out of basements
and bomb shelters today to inspect damage from an overnight duel
between Syrian and Christian gunners that police said killed 27
people and wounded 152.
   Police said the 15-hour battle involved howitzers and
multi-barrelled rocket launchers in Beirut, the surrounding
mountains and the eastern Bekaa valley.
   The casualties raised the toll from the five-month confrontation
between Gen. Michel Aoun's predominantly Christian troops and
Syrian forces to 576 killed and 1,474 wounded.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with police
rules, said about a dozen shells crashed into Baabda and the nearby
suburbs of Hazmiyeh and Hadath today but that no casualties from
that fighting were immediately reported.
   On Thursday, the shelling escalated sharply after Syrian gunners
started pounding the presidential palace with salvos from 240mm
mortars.
   Aoun moved into a bunker beneath the palace when the latest
round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war began March 8.
   In the overnight barrage, rockets gouged gaping holes in
residential apartments, shattering walls and windows and triggering
fires that blazed out of control and lighted up the night sky.
   ``Thank God we're alive,'' said Mrs. Khadija Alaya as she came
out of a shelter with her daughter, each carrying a mattress and a
pillow, to find smoke billowing from their sixth-floor apartment.
   Other residents of the Moslem Tarik Jedideh district, still in
pajamas and nightgowns, made their way through debris and glass
shards carpeting the street to inspect their homes for damage.
   The artillery battles have damaged thousands of buildings in
Beirut and sent all but 200,000 of the city's 1.5 million residents
fleeing to safer areas in southern Lebanon, the Bekaa valley and
northeastern mountains.
   ``My sister fled a month ago to the Bekaa, she rented a house
there. I wonder whether she's still alive after last night's
shelling,'' said Hoda Qannine, a housewife in Tarik Jedideh, a
low-income district that took the brunt of the shelling along with
the city's southern slums.
   The police spokesman said more than 10,000 shells and rockets
rained on Beirut, the southeastern mountains and the eastern Bekaa
valley in a barrage that peaked at 60 shells a minute.
   He said the battlefield was expanded as Aoun's gunners opened up
on Syrian army positions in the ancient town of Baalbek and other
areas of the valley 40 miles northeast of Beirut.
   Reliable sources in the Bekaa, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Aoun's gunners scored direct hits on at least six
Syrian army outposts and artillery emplacements. A Baalbek resident
who drove to Beirut early in the day said a dozen shells crashed
into the city and the surrounding villages overnight.
   She said Syrian army ambulances ``brought casualties all night
from different parts of the Bekaa'' to a hospital in Baalbek run by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The Syrian command in Lebanon refuses comment on its losses.
   The current fighting began after Aoun blockaded ports run by
Syria's militia allies south of Beirut with the aim of salvaging
about $100 million annually in lost customs dues.
   The Syrians and allied militias retaliated by besieging and
shelling the Christian enclave northeast of the capital.
   Aoun, 54, a Maronite Catholic, escalated the confrontation by
declaring a ``war of liberation'' against the 40,000 Syrian troops
in Lebanon. He said they betrayed their 1976 peacekeeping mandate
from the Arab League by taking the Moslem side against the
Christians in the civil war.

<TEXT>
   Earth will be treated to one of the the biggest
cosmic shows of the year tonight when the Perseids meteor shower
arrives, and late-night watchers should be able to spot about one
shooting star a minute.
   ``The Perseids meteor shower traditionally is the biggest of the
year,'' Jack Horkheimer, head of Miami's Space Transit Planetarium
and also known as public television's ``Star Hustler,'' said
Thursday.
   But he warned star-gazers not to expect a Fourth of July
fireworks display.
   ``Even at their best, they're meteor sprinkles,'' he said. ``Try
to spot one extremely bright meteor during the night, then call it
quits.''
   The Perseids shower, named because they appear to radiate from
the constellation Perseus, are most visible after midnight each
Aug. 12. The shower is made up of the remnants of a trail of dust
left by the Swift-Tuttle comet, last sighted in 1862.
   Each year the Earth runs through the comet's old trail,
Horkheimer said.
   ``Meteors are comet litter,'' he said. ``It's like driving
behind a garbage truck on a bumpy road _ the debris slams into your
windshield.''
   The left-over dust hits the earth's atmosphere at an altitude of
about 70 miles, and the heat ignites gases as the particles
disintegrate in the air, creating the characteristic meteor trail.
   Astronomers don't know whether Swift-Tuttle will some day
return. If it doesn't, the show, which gradually grows dimmer each
year, could eventually disappear, Horkheimer said.
   The Perseids shower is not the only astronomical event upcoming.
On Wednesday, the United States, especially the East Coast, will
have a good view of the region's first Lunar eclipse in seven years.

<HEAD>Foreign Ministry Hopes Auschwitz Convent Will Be Removed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Foreign Ministry today expressed hope
that a Roman Catholic convent will be removed from the grounds of
the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland despite opposition by
Polish church leaders.
   Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow, Poland, said Thursday
conditions did not exist for carrying out a 1987 agreement between
the church and Jewish organizations to relocate the Carmelite
convent away from the camp.
   Macharski blamed the delay on protests by Jewish groups which
intensified this year after the February deadline for moving the
convent passed. He accused the Jewish groups of ``creating an
atmosphere of aggressive demands.''
   Last month, Rabbi Avraham Weiss of Riverdale, N.Y., and six of
his students protested in front of the convent, and were beaten and
dragged from the site by construction workers at the convent.
   Weiss said Thursday that Macharski's claim was ``despicable''
and anti-Semitic. He said if the nuns were not moved, he would lead
protest groups to Poland and urge Jews not to travel there.
   An estimated 2.5 million Jews were among the 4 million people
the Nazis killed at Auschwitz in World War II.
   The international Jewish community considers Christian symbols
on the perimeter of the camp a desecration of the memory of their
slain brethren. The convent is in a former Nazi warehouse whose
lawn used to be a gravel pit where prisoners were executed. Today,
a 23-foot cross stands at the site.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry said it learned of Macharski's
statement only in news reports and was still awaiting a report from
the head of Israel's interest office in Warsaw, Mordechai Paltzur.
   ``Although it is true that the Foreign Ministry is not part of
the February 1987 agreement ... it supports the implementation of
this agreement and we have no reason to believe that the
signatories would not respect it,'' the ministry said.
   It said Palzur met three weeks ago with the Polish officials and
was promised that the Polish government planned to intervene to
implement the agreement.
   Israel's minister of religious affairs, Zevullun Hammer, is to
visit Poland soon and will discuss the issue with his Polish
counterpart and Macharski, said the Ministry of Religious Affairs'
director, Zevullun Or-Lev.
   ``We will explain morally that the Auschwitz death camp is first
and foremost a Jewish site,'' Or-Lev said.

   Steinway tries to run an upright piano factory _
but a pack of lowdown cats with the run of the place are sounding a
sour note at night.
   The stray cats appear to view the hand-crafted, $50,000 pianos
inside as nothing more than fine outhouses and scratching posts. So
officials of the Queens plant are singing the blues and setting cat
traps.
   Factory workers report they're catching about eight cats each
week inside the building. ``That sounds about right. I don't think
that's high,'' said Leo Spellman, a Steinway spokesman.
   The kitty capers are a first at the plant, which opened in 1870.
And the problem gets worse for Steinway because it sets back the
slow, painstaking effort which goes into making their pianos.
   A Steinway grand piano _ the model favored by Vladimir Horowitz,
Van Cliburn and other maestros _ takes dozens of workers a full
year to create. But their efforts can be undone in a single night
of feline revelry, said factory superintendent Ron Penatzer.
   If the cats use a piano soundboard to relieve themselves, it
takes six weeks and costs $2,000 to repair the piece, he said.
Spellman said the company did not have an estimate on how much the
kitties had cost it.
   The cats hide out on the 10-acre facility until the workers
depart at 4:30 p.m. When they return the next morning, the workers
find pianos covered with paw prints, scratches, or ... or ... you
know.
   Company officials blame an illegal dump on an adjacent lot for
the problem. The dump attracts rats, which in turn bring in the
cats, which use the factory to unwind after dining.
   When traps snare a furry prey, Steinway workers return the cats
to their dump home, leaving them free to make a return engagement
the following night through the aging complex's many nooks and
crannies.
   The company has told the city about the problem and even
volunteered to clean the site itself, but their complaints ``have
fallen on deaf ears,'' Spellman said.
   Department of Sanitation spokesman Vito Turso said the dead-end
street ``sounds like a classic place for illegal dumping,'' adding
that the most the city can do is police the area once or twice a
year.
   Unfortunately for Steinway, that hasn't been enough to keep
their factory feline-free.
   ``We don't like it. It's not extensive, not in any way affecting
the manufacturing, but it's embarrassing,'' said Spellman. ``We
wish the city would clean it up and put this to rest.''

<HEAD>Canadian Woman Swims Chilly Strait of Juan de Fuca, Uses Butterfly
Stroke</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 28-year-old marathon swimmer
has become the first person using the butterfly stroke to conquer
the 19-mile wide Strait of Juan de Fuca separating Vancouver Island
from Washington state.
   Vicki Keith completed the crossing from Port Angeles, Wash., in
slightly more than 14 hours Thursday. About 3,000 people cheered
her conquest of the busy shipping lane.
   ``I just want to get some warmth,'' were the first words Keith
uttered, shivering uncontrollably but uninjured.
   Keith, a swimming coach from Kingston, Ontario, was in the
50-degree water six hours less than she had anticipated, but she
was unable to crawl out of the surf at the end of the swim and had
to be helped ashore.
   She is the first swimmer to make the crossing using the
butterfly, one of the most demanding of swim strokes. Five others
have made the swim using the freestyle.
   ``I have never, ever swum that hard in a swim before in my
life,'' she said after the swim. ``I was concerned about staying in
the water too long.''
   Experts have said that most people wouldn't survive three hours
in the strait, which is several degrees colder than the English
Channel.
   Bad weather had prompted Keith to postpone her swim from
Wednesday to Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Rescue workers today found no trace
of U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland's plane in areas where two distress
signals were detected, and they resumed looking along its intended
flight path, the U.S. Embassy said.
   The Houston Democrat and 15 other people were aboard the
twin-engine Twin Otter when it disappeared Monday on a flight from
Addis Ababa to the Fugnido refugee camp, 480 miles to the southwest
near the Sudanese border.
   Leland, chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, was
one of nine Americans aboard the flight.
   James Haley, an embassy spokesman, said rescue workers on foot
and in planes scoured rugged highlands north and southeast of
Ethiopia's capital where the distress signals were detected by
satellites Thursday and early today.
   Two giant C-130 Hercules cargo planes left the capital shortly
before 7 a.m. to check the areas, but by midday they were diverted
to a region several hundred miles southwest of Addis Ababa. That
put the main area of the search back along the intended flight path
of the plane.
   ``They have pretty well exhausted those areas, and they're going
back and concentrating the search to the southwest of'' the
capital, Haley said.
   Haley said U.S. authorities increased their count of those
traveling with Leland from 13 to 15. No reason was immediately
given.
   In Washington, officials with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration said a satellite was unable to detect a
third signal when it flew over the area later this morning.
   By midmorning bad weather had forced suspension of the aerial
search in an area near Goba, 85 miles southeast of the capital,
where the first signal was detected. Heavy clouds, rain and low
visibility have prevented evening aerial searches since the rescue
mission began four days ago.
   Both signals detected by the satellite were significantly off
the plane's intended flight plan, and officials have said they may
have come from other sources. However, Haley said bad weather may
have forced Leland's pilot to seek a different route to the refugee
camp.
   The latest signal, detected about 1 a.m. (6 p.m. EDT), was read
as coming from about 100 miles northwest of Addis Ababa, directly
opposite the direction Leland's party was headed when its plane
disappeared in bad weather.
   Thursday's signal was about 90 degrees off the line of the
flight plan.
   The Canadian-built plane, which seats up to 20 passengers, was
owned by Ethiopia's government relief agency. It was equipped with
an emergency locator transmitter, a device usually mounted in the
tail of an aircraft and activated either automatically by impact or
manually by the pilot.
   Depending on its type, an emergency locator transmits either an
intermittent or steady signal on a fixed frequency, allowing
searchers to pinpoint the location of a downed aircraft.
   For the last three days, the search has centered on inaccessible
regions in southwestern Ethiopia where peasants reportedly heard
planes circling remote fields 100 miles north and southeast of
Fugnido on Monday.
   The area is a region of foothills stretching into swamps that
reach toward Ethiopia's border with Sudan.
   U.S. officials have acknowledged Leland's plane could have
crashed into one of the many mountains along its path; some of the
peaks are higher than 12,000 feet.
   Haley said there were eight other Americans aboard, including
three members of Leland's staff, a friend of the congressman, three
officials of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the
spouse of one agency official. Also aboard were an Ethiopian
employee of the U.S. Embassy, three Ethiopian officials and a crew
of three.
   The spouse had earlier been counted as a U.S. employee, and the
Ethiopian employee of the embassy and a third crew member were
added to the passenger list.
   In Washington, Leland's press secretary, Alma Newsom, said a
congressional delegation sent by House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., arrived in Addis Ababa this morning and was briefed on the
search.

<HEAD>State Tax Revenue Up by 7 Percent</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Adds one graf that local real estate taxes not included</HEAD>

   State tax revenues increased by 7 percent
nationally in fiscal 1988, the government says, with Hawaii,
Montana and Oklahoma leading the way by adding 20 percent each to
their coffers.
   The Commerce Department reportd Thursday that state tax
collections totaled $264 billion in the year ending June 30, 1988,
compared with $246 billion in fiscal 1987.
   Other states reporting big percentage gains included Texas, 19
percent; Alaska, 18 percent; Kansas and Maine, 17 percent each;
Florida, 16 percent, and South Dakota, 15 percent.
   While Hawaii, Montana and Oklahoma posted the biggest percentage
gains, Alaska recorded the highest state per-capita tax payments,
$2,439. However, the Alaska payments included $818.7 million in
severance taxes on oil and gas production that skew individual
income tax payments.
   Other per capita leaders were Hawaii, $1,866; Delaware, $1,543;
New York, $1,462, and Massachusetts, $1,451. At the bottom of the
per capita ranking were New Hampshire, $532; South Dakota, $665;
Oregon, $770; Tennessee, $784, and Texas, $600.
   The national per capita tax average was $1,077, the department
said.
   Only three states reported decreases in 1988 state tax revenue _
Wyoming, down 9 percent, and Oregon and West Virginia, each down 6
percent.
   Taxpayers placed $36 billion in California's state coffers, the
largest collection reported. Other big revenue producers were New
York, $26 billion; Texas, $13 billion; Pennsylvania, $12 billion;
Illinois, Michigan and Florida, $11 billion each; and Ohio, $10
billion.
   Tax collections in those eight states totaled nearly half of the
taxes collected nationally.
   South Dakota collected the smallest amount, $476 million.
Ranking with it at the bottom of the tax collection list were
Wyoming, $573 million; New Hampshire, $583 million; Vermont, $617
million; and North Dakota, $633 million.
   The department said general sales and gross receipts taxes were
the largest source of state tax revenues at $87 billion, up 10
percent from 1987. Individual income taxes accounted for $80
billion, up 5 percent, while corporate net income taxes rose 6
percent to $22 billion.
   ``The general sales tax is still the primary revenue source in
most states, accounting for more revenue than any other tax source
in 23 of the 50 states,'' the department said, ``and in 18 of the
39 states which impose both a general sales tax and an individual
income tax.
   ``The individual income tax is the primary source of tax revenue
in 24 states, while the severance tax is the primary source in
Alaska and Wyoming,'' it added.
   The Commerce report included data on state taxes only, most of
which was collected by a canvass of state offices. Revenue from
non-tax sources such as federal government payments was not
included.
   In addition, the report did not include figures for the real
estate taxes that are a primary source of revenue for local, as
opposed to state, governments.

   VCRs started smoking, light bulbs
exploded and ceiling fans raced as if they were going into orbit
when the power company mistakenly doubled the normal amount of
electricity in 30 homes.
   ``It's a $50,000 foul-up _ 30 houses suffered as much as $2,000
in damages,'' said Florida Power &amp; Light customer service manager
Vic Arena, who promised that the utility would pay to replace all
the burned-out appliances.
   Helen Johns was feeding her 6-year-old son and three infants
Tuesday when the power surge hit her house, snuffing out the air
conditioner, television, stereo, telephone answering machine, can
opener, clock-radio and every other appliance she had plugged in.
   ``My son started screaming, `Mom, the VCR's on fire!''' Mrs.
Johns said. ``I grabbed the three little ones and my son and threw
them outside.''
   The utility blamed a work crew for the mistake, saying crew
members missed a section of line when they were converting
transformers in the neighborhood to a new voltage.

<TEXT>
   The leader of a Jewish militant group fired
shots at a longtime rival and injured a bystander, then holed up in
his heavily armed apartment for 2{ hours before surrendering,
authorities said.
   Mordechai Levy, 27, head of the Jewish Defense Organization, was
arrested Thursday afternoon at his home in Greenwich Village.
   Police said Levy took a Ruger Mini-14 rifle to the roof of his
townhouse after it was approached by Irv Rubin, head of the Jewish
Defense League. Levy led a JDL splinter group and had been feuding
for years with the Los Angeles-based Rubin.
   ``He was afraid that the people were coming to kill him,'' said
Chief Robert J. Johnston Jr.
   Levy expressed the fear in calls to the police Wednesday night
and again about noon Thursday, when two men started throwing rocks
at his window, Johnston said. The men were trying to serve Levy
with papers for a libel suit Rubin filed against Levy in Los
Angeles Superior Court on July 27, Johnston said.
   Levy was charged with attempted murder of Rubin and three other
men _ a private investigator, a process server and a 69-year-old
bystander who was shot in the knee, police said.
   The libel lawsuit says Levy, in an interview with a Los Angeles
talk radio station, accused Rubin of being a drug dealer and said
his wife, Shelly, had attempted suicide, according to Earl Krugel,
chairman of the JDL's Los Angeles chapter.
   Police kept Levy's building under siege until he surrendered
because he had permits for seven guns, said Inspector Richard
Mayronne. Levy's building lobby was rigged with remote-controlled
tear gas, police said.
   People who said they were linked with Levy's group have claimed
responsibility for bombing targets they accused of anti-Semitism,
but Levy has always denied his group was involved.
   The JDL was formed by Rabbi Meir Kahane to mount armed response
to anti-Semitic acts in New York. It dropped most of its activities
after Kahane moved to Israel and was elected to the parliament.

<TEXT>
   Two efforts to boost the Hipparcos star-mapping
satellite into its final orbit have failed, the European Space
Agency said today.
   The agency said more attempts were planned Saturday and Sunday.
   The satellite was launched Tuesday night by an Ariane rocket. It
is in a safe orbit and all other systems are operating normally,
the agency said.
   But if not placed in a higher orbit soon, the satellite will be
pulled back to earth.
   The satellite, launched from the European Space Agency's center
in Kourou, French Guiana, is on a mission to plot with
unprecedented precision the position and motion of 120,000 stars.
   A secondary experiment is to provide less precise data
concerning 400,000 stars.
   A first effort to light the satellite's engine to boost it into
geostationary orbit failed for unknown reasons Thursday. The
agency's engineers in Darmstadt, West Germany, tried again this
morning, with no results.

<HEAD>Workers Stage Warning Strike in Gdansk</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Solidarity-called one-hour strike.
No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buses stopped running and plants halted production
today in Gdansk as Solidarity staged a one-hour strike demanding
compensation for recent price increases and an end to political
favoritism in factories.
   The general strike in the Baltic port city, which union
spokesmen said affected hundreds of workplaces, was the first
provincewide action taken by Solidarity since it was legalized in
April after a seven-year ban.
   In Italy, meanwhile, two key Solidarity political leaders
reiterated the labor movement's demand to head the government but
raised the possibility of including reform-minded communists in a
governing coalition.
   In an editorial today, the Polish government newspaper
Rzeczpospolita renewed its call for a ``grand coalition''
government that would include Solidarity and the communists.
   But the opposition paper Gazeta Wyborcza stressed that only a
Solidarity-led government would ``bring about the social
reawakening necessary for reconstruction after the catastrophe.''
   The protest action today from noon to 1 p.m. was joined by the
communist-linked trade union federation OPZZ in the province, which
said it approved of Solidarity's economic demands.
   ``I can see through the window that city transport has
stopped,'' said a spokesman at Solidarity's Gdansk Information
Agency, speaking by telephone shortly after noon. ``Trams and buses
have stopped ... I see people waiting at bus stops.''
   Krzysztof Dowgiallo of the Solidarity regional council in Gdansk
estimated that 500 enterprises planned to strike, and it appeared
the action was successful. He said the city had become quiet, and
banners were hanging from many factories proclaiming the strike.
   The protest was aimed at achieving six economic and political
demands:
   _Increasing planned pay compensation for recent food price
increases of up to 300 percent.
   _Ending monopolies in the purchase and distribution of
agricultural products.
   _Stopping the financing of political or union organizations by
enterprises (such as factory-level communist groups.)
   _Liquidating the ``nomenklatura'' _ the system by which
promotions to management are nearly always given to party loyalists.
   _Creation of union rights for employees whose plants are
subordinated to the defense and police ministries.
   _Speeding up the holding of local council elections to be held
for the first time on a totally democratic basis.
   Solidarity chapters in the northwestern port of Szczecin and the
southern city of Katowice said they would stage similar one-hour
protests Wednesday.
   Today's strike came a day after Solidarity began talks with two
minor parties who hold the balance of power in parliament about
forming a Solidarity government, as urged this week by the
movement's leader Lech Walesa.
   Bronislaw Geremek and Adam Michnik, who were received by
Polish-born Pope John Paul II at the pope's Castel Gandolfo summer
palace, stressed in interviews Thursday with Italian television
that the key was for Solidarity to head the next government but
that it could include communists.
   ``That which was offered to us, participation in a government
headed by communists, means the perpetuation of the regime,'' said
Geremek, the No. 2 Solidarity political leader after Walesa.
   ``The only government that can appear credible in the eyes of
the Polish people is an executive headed by Solidarity in coalition
with all the reformist forces in the country,'' including communist
reformers, said Michnik, one of Walesa's closest strategists.
   Geremek explained in the interview that Solidarity feels forced
by the economic crisis _ especially the sharp increase in food
prices Aug. 1 _ to accelerate its long-range timetable for taking
power.
   ``We asked ourselves, do we have time to wait? The answer we
gave ourselves is no. There is no more time,'' Geremek said.
   As Solidarity works to form a government, newly elected
communist Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak is pressing on with his
search for a Cabinet to present to the Sejm, or parliament. Walesa
has said he will urge Solidarity lawmakers to reject any government
led by Kiszczak.

   Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer
formed his Cabinet today and appointed his predecessor, David
Lange, to the post of attorney general.
   Palmer took over as prime minister after Lange resigned Monday
for what he described as health reasons. Lange quit after five
years following a year-long internal party wrangle over economic
policy. Palmer was elected leader of the governing Labor Party the
following day.
   Lange, 47, also was named minister of state and put in charge of
the Serious Fraud Office. The positions, including that of attorney
general, fall outside Cabinet.
   Lange said he was pleased with his new jobs, which he will
assume officially on Monday.
   Palmer made no major changes to financial or economic
portfolios. David Caygill remains finance minister and minister of
revenue, with Peter Neilson staying as associate minister of
finance outside of Cabinet.
   Roger Douglas, who was returned to the Cabinet last week after
being dismissed by Lange last year as finance minister, was
appointed minister of police and minister of immigration, as well
as having responsibilities for the Audit Department and for Special
Projects, such as planning election strategy.
   The Labor government must go the polls by October 1990.
   Palmer has cut his workload to enable him to concentrate on the
job of prime minister, but he remains minister for the environment.
He was formerly attorney general and justice minister. Palmer also
remains minister in charge of the New Zealand Security Intelligence
Service.
   Helen Clark, deputy prime minister, remains minister of health
and becomes minister of labor.
   Mike Moore stays on as minister of external relations and trade,
and minister of overseas trade and marketing.

<TEXT>
   Lawyers alleged today that the
military tortured 21 people in an attempt to force them to confess
they were members of an assassination squad.
   Attorney George Gaduang told reporters the alleged torture
victims were among 85 people arrested in a series of raids in July
and accused of being communist rebels.
   Gaduang said they signed affidavits claiming they were tortured
during their first two days of detention.
   Efforts to contact military officials for comment were
unsuccessful.
   Of the 85 people arrested, 60 have been released. The 25 still
in custody have not been charged, Gaduang said, although Philippine
law requires that suspects be charged within 48 hours of arrest or
freed.
   The military has said those still held are members of the rebel
Alex Boncayao Brigade, which has taken responsibility for killing
hundreds of police officers and soldiers in the capital in the last
three years.
   Gaduang said all 25 deny they are communist rebels.
   Also today, presidential spokeswoman Deedee Sytangco said
President Corazon Aquino has approved a civilian trial for three
soldiers accused of murder in the March 1988 slaying of leftist
Reynaldo Francisco and the torture of his companion, Hilario
Bustamante.
   Military courts in the Philippines normally have jurisdiction in
cases of soldiers accused of crimes against civilians. Human rights
groups claim such courts routinely favor soldiers over civilians.
   The waiver came one month after the National Bureau of
Investigation filed murder charges against Lt. Wilbur Naldo, Sgt.
Arnel Jocson and Constable 2nd Class Dioscoro Ambagay. A civilian
informant, Bartolome Nieves, was also charged in the case.
   Bustamante said he and Francisco were abducted on a Manila
street on March 18, 1988, while putting up posters opposing the
U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
   They were taken to the headquarters of Mrs. Aquino's security
force, tortured and then driven to a remote area where Francisco
was slain, Bustamante said.
   Bustamante was found near death March 21, 1988 with deep stab
wounds and cuts across his body.

   Retail sales, paced by renewed spending on
automobiles, rebounded 0.9 percent in July after falling the
previous month, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said sales increased to a seasonally
adjusted $143.7 billion last month following a 0.1 percent decline
in June. The June sales had been revised to $142.4 billion from the
$140.8 billion originally reported last month.
   The department also revised the May retail sales sharply to an
0.8 percent increase, rather than the 0.1 percent decrease
previously reported. It said the revision was due to responses from
additional retailers.
   Retail sales are viewed as a measure of economic health since
they account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity.
   The economy has slowed over the past year as the Federal Reserve
drove interest rates higher to head off inflation. Spending on
durable goods _ big-ticket items such as cars expected to last more
than three years _ has been particularly affected by the Fed's
credit-tightening measures.
   The Fed switched course in June, however, and since then has
nudged interest rates lower in an effort to keep the economy out of
a recession.
   The Commerce Department said auto sales, which fell 1 percent in
June, bounced back 2.7 percent last month, their best month since
rising 4.7 percent in October 1988. Auto sales posted a 0.7 percent
drop in May.
   Autos represent about 20 percent of total retail sales.
   July auto sales totaled $31.7 billion, the highest level since
$31.9 billion in sales in December 1988, the department said. The
sales record was $33.9 billion in September 1986.
   Durable goods sales as a whole rose 1.7 percent in July after
falling 0.9 percent in June and 0.5 percent in May.
   Furniture and other home furnishing sales were down 0.3 percent.
   Excluding the automotive category, overall retail sales rose 0.4
percent, following increases of 0.2 percent in June and 1.2 percent
in May.
   Sales of non-durable goods rose 0.4 percent last month after
climbing 0.4 percent in June and 0.2 percent in May.
   Department store and other general merchandise spending was up
0.5 percent.
   Also showing increased sales in the non-durable category were
grocery stores, up 0.6 percent; restaurants, up 1.2 percent, and
drug stores, up l0.1 percent.
   The only non-durable category posting a decline was clothing
stores, down 1.5 percent. Service station sales remained level.
   For the three months from May through July, overall retail sales
were 6 percent higher than the same period in 1988.
   The retail sales declines in May and June represented the first
consecutive monthly drops since 1987, when sales fell 0.8 percent
in September and 0.9 percent in October.

   A conservative Christian group asked a
federal judge to prohibit police from using painful arrest methods
against anti-abortion protesters.
   The request for a temporary restraining order was filed Thursday
by the Rutherford Institute of California on behalf of Operation
Rescue supporters, who have attempted to block abortion clinics and
slow down police efforts to arrest them by such tactics as going
limp and even smearing their arms with petroleum jelly.
   A hearing on the request was scheduled this afternoon before
U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima.
   ``Our case is really not, if you will, an abortion rights
case,'' said Samuel B. Casey of the Rutherford Institute. He
described the complaint as a civil rights case that arises under
the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which protects citizens
from unreasonable seizure.
   ``The rights that we seek to vindicate are equally valuable to
any kind of peaceful, non-violent demonstrator,'' Casey said.
   The suit was filed, Casey said, because he believes police are
using pain compliance techniques, such as bending a wrist or arm
backward against the joint, in escalating fashion against
anti-abortion demonstrators. The group is trying to block the use
of such tactics at a deminstration planned for Saturday.
   Police will argue against any attempt to prohibit officers from
using the force necessary to make arrests, said Cmdr. William
Booth, a police spokesman.
   ``A police department can hardly function and society can hardly
have effective order if those who are to be arrested dictate the
terms of their arrest,'' Booth said.
   ``The law provides for us to use the amount of force necessary
to make an arrest, and the courts have interpreted that to mean the
amount of force needed to overcome the arrestee's resistance to
arrest.''
   However, Booth said police will protect the rights of
demonstrators who exercise their rights to free speech and
assembly, providing the protest is lawful.
   Police in Los Angeles are using painful arrest techniques to
counter Operation Rescue's strategy of illegally blocking the
entrances to abortion clinics and delaying arrests to keep them
closed as long as possible. To accomplish this, Operation Rescue
protesters are taught to resist passively, by going limp like a rag
doll or flexing their muscles rigidly.
   Others smear petroleum jelly on their arms and legs to make it
more difficult for officers to carry them to paddy wagons.
   Police made arrests during Operation Rescue protests in Los
Angeles on June 10 and March 25 because the demonstrators were
blocking abortion clinics in defiance of a federal court order.

   Outgoing President P.W. Botha
said today he was not consulted about a diplomatic mission to
Zambia his heir apparent plans to make, indicating a deepening rift
between the two.
   F.W. de Klerk, expected to succeed Botha in September, responded
to Botha's complaint by calling an urgent meeting of his fellow
Cabinet ministers. He said he had not been able to arrange an
appointment with Botha to discuss the ``possible misunderstanding.''
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda announced Thursday that he
would meet Aug. 28 with de Klerk, leader of the governing National
Party.
   The planned meeting in Livingstone, Zambia, was confirmed by
South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, who said he also would
attend. The foreign minister said the meeting was arranged after
consultations with President Botha.
   However, the president issued a terse statement contradicting
the foreign minister.
   ``I am not aware, in terms of the rules governing overeas
journeys by (Cabinet) ministers, of the discussions to be held ...
as announced by Dr. Kaunda,'' President Botha's statement said.
   The independent South African Press Association said the
president's ``bombshell statement'' had plunged the National Party
into a ``pre-election crisis.'' Andries Treurnicht, leader of the
far-right Conservative Party, said the administration was in
``total chaos.''
   The president's spokesman, Jack Viviers, told the agency that
Botha was at his office in Cape Town. Asked why Cabinet ministers
were unable to meet him, Viviers replied: ``I don't know. Ask
them.''
   Foreign Ministry officials said they were trying to reach Pik
Botha for an explanation. The two Bothas are not related.
   ``Attempts by ministers to arrange an urgent appointment with
the state president in order to attempt to clear up the matter have
so far been unsuccessful,'' de Klerk said in a statement. ``In the
light of these facts, I am in the process of calling an urgent
meeting of all available National Party ministers for the earliest
opportunity.''
   Botha technically is in charge of the Cabinet, but de Klerk also
has some authority over the ministers because all of them are
National Party members.
   Relations between President Botha and de Klerk have been uneasy
since February, when Botha resigned as National Party leader after
suffering a stroke. Party leaders subsequently threw their support
behind de Klerk.
   Botha last year launched an unprecedented diplomatic initiative
into black Africa, holding summit meetings with the presidents of
Mozambique, Zaire and the Ivory Coast.
   De Klerk, expected to succeed Botha after parliamentary
elections Sept. 6, has continued the initiative, meeting recently
with Mozambique's President Joaquim Chissano.
   His planned meeting with Kaunda is seen as particularly
significant, since the Zambian is chairman of the Frontline States,
a six-nation group established for the purpose of confronting South
Africa's white rulers.
   Kaunda has led calls for isolation of South Africa until its
policy of apartheid, which bars the black majority from having a
voice in national affairs, is abolished.
   Kuanda's country also is headquarters for the African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting to overthrow the South
African government.

   The army today doubled to one year the period
for which Palestinians can be held without trial or indictment,
marking a renewed effort to quell the 20-month Palestinian uprising.
   The army said the order, issued by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin and approved by Justice Minister Dan Meridor, was made ``for
security reasons and in accordance with the situation existing
these days in the (occupied) territories.''
   ``We are in a war, and sometimes residents' or citizens' rights
are harmed in the course of a war. We have to find the right
balance so that the damage would not be too serious, but on the
other hand we have to allow the army to fight and win that war,''
Meridor said on Israel radio.
   Israel adopted the administrative detention procedure from 1945
emergency regulations used by the British during their rule of
mandatory Palestine, often against Jews fighting for the creation
of a Jewish state.
   The United States and human rights organizations have condemned
the procedure as a violation of due process.
   In numerous cases, detention has been extended to more than one
six-month term. But army officials have demanded a freer hand,
complaining that judicial procedures complicate their fight against
the uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   At least 534 Palestinians have been killed by soldiers and
settlers during the uprising. Thirty-eight Israelis have also died.
   The army command said a person detained without trial for more
than six months ``will be entitled to bring his case to a judge who
deals with both military and civilian matters at least once in six
months.''
   Israel defends detention without trial as an effective means of
arresting violent ringleaders without having to reveal sources of
information. But attorneys complain they cannot respond to
unspecified, secret charges against Palestinian suspects.
   A U.S. State Department report on human rights released in
February criticized the procedure. It also disputed Israeli claims,
saying that in many cases Palestinians were detained for political
reasons or non-violent activities.
   The report also said that some 20 percent of detention orders
have been renewed after the initial six months.
   According to army figures released today, 9,136 Palestinians are
jailed for uprising-related offenses; 2,111 of them are in
administrative detention.
   Joshua Schoffman of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel,
a private group, said the new step ``could just be a way of the
army showing it is getting tougher.''
   Schoffman said his group filed a Supreme Court appeal Thursday,
claiming that the army fails to notify Arab families of the arrest
of relatives and their place of detention, making it harder to
provide legal assistance or visit jailed relatives.
   Meanwhile, the government-run Central Bureau of Statistics said
that despite the uprising, the population of Jewish settlements in
the occupied lands is 6,500 higher than last year.
   It reported that 66,500 Jews lived in the territories in late
1988, an increase of 10.3 percent over 1987. Others claim the
figure is higher or lower and has been manipulated for political
reasons.
   About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza.

<TEXT>
   A United Nations official today
dismissed claims by the SWAPO movement that South Africa is
planning to rig Namibia's elections by bringing in 100,000 people
to vote.
   SWAPO, the South-West Africa People's Organization, fought a
23-year bush war against South African rule of Namibia and is
favored in November's pre-independence polls.
   But SWAPO's U.N. observer, Hinyangerwa Asheeke, said Thursday
that a ``loophole'' in Namibia's election law allows up to 100,000
South Africans with Namibia ties to vote, and that another 50,000
Angolans belonging to the UNITA rebel movement will be fraudulently
registered.
   South Africa supported UNITA, or the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola, in its battle against Angola's
Marxist government until a regional peace treaty was signed last
year.
   ``We have no evidence to support (SWAPO's) allegations,'' said
Hisham Omayad of Ghana, the United Nations electoral director in
Namibia.
   Omayad said only 1,560 South Africans have registered in Namibia
under a proposed election law that extends voting rights to anyone
who has lived in the territory for the past four years or longer,
regardless of nationality.
   People who were born in Namibia but now live elsewhere also
would be allowed to vote under the proposed law.
   U.N. officials have said previously there is no evidence of
Angolan citizens coming to Namibia to register.
   Voter registration began in early July and ends Sept. 15. More
than 500,000 of the 700,000 people expected to register have done
so, U.N. officials said.
   The election law remains open for public comment and still must
be approved by Martti Ahtisarri, who heads the U.N. operation in
Namibia.
   Omayad also said that people are required to show birth
certificates when they register and SWAPO could challenge in court
any voters they believe were registered fraudulently.
   Thousands of South Africans have served in Namibia over the
years as soldiers or civil servants. But most have left and only a
fraction of those remaining meet the four-year residency
requirement.
   Asheeke suggested SWAPO would not recognize the results of an
election that is not ``free and fair.''
   ``We are forewarning the international community to a very
dangerous situation,'' he said.
   ``Pretoria proceeded with enacting this election law, obviously
with the connivance of (Ahtisaari)'' said Asheeke, apparently
unaware that Ahtisaari has yet to rule on the proposed legislation.
   African nations called for the U.N. Security Council to meet
Monday to discuss ``the deteriorating situation in Namibia.''
Ghanaian Ambassador J.V. Gbeho made the request in a letter to the
council's president.
   November's election will choose a constituent assembly, which
will write a constitution and organize a government. If SWAPO can
win two-thirds of the vote, it can write the consititution by
itself.

   A clandestine Islamic fundamentalist
group has threatened to kill Pope John Paul II if he visits
Indonesia, Indonesian authorities and church sources said today.
   The Islamic movement, which calls itself Mujahiddin
Fisabillillah, sent letters to Indonesian authorities and the
apostolic nunciature of the Holy See in Jakarta saying ``there will
be a blood bath'' if the pope comes to Indonesia as planned in
October.
   ``Whether it is a prank or not, we must take all the necessary
precautions,'' said a Roman Catholic Church official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   At the Vatican, the Rev. Giovanni D'Ercole, a Vatican spokesman,
said he had not heard anything about the letter.
   The letter described the committee arranging the pope's visit as
``no more than colonialist dogs during the rule of the Dutch.''
   Indonesia, a former colony of the Netherlands, declared
independence from Dutch rule on Aug. 17, 1945.
   The Vatican ambassador, Francesco Canalini, refused to say
whether he had seen the letter. He said the main purpose of the
pope's visit will be to meet with the country's Catholic faithful.
   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 175 million people are Moslem.
   The pope will be in Indonesia from Oct. 9-14 and is scheduled to
visit Jakarta, Jogjakarta in central Java, Flores in the lesser
Sunda islands, Medan in north Sumatra and the former Portugese
colony of East Timor.
   It will be the first papal visit to the country since Pope Paul
VI visited in 1970.

   A soldier's wife who had fantasized about being
pregnant was charged with kidnapping after she posed as a nurse and
abducted a 5-day-old girl from a suburban hospital, police said.
The child was unhurt.
   Starla Katrice Martin-Hamtak was taken from Victory Memorial
Hospital in Waukegan at around noon Thursday by 40-year-old Barbara
Chrushshon, who brought the baby to her home at Fort Sheridan army
base north of Chicago, police said.
   Authorities said that when Mrs. Chrushshon's husband, Spec. 4
Jacque Chrushshon, arrived home and found the unexpected baby with
his wife, he contacted his superiors. Army officials linked the
soldier's report about the baby with news reports of the abduction.
   Mrs. Chrushshon was charged with aggravated kidnapping,
according to Lake County State's Attorney Fred Foreman.
   Police said they believe Mrs. Chrushshon, who has two children
who live out of state in the custody of her first husband, was
depressed because she was unable to conceive another child.
   Waukegan police Lt. Tim Niemietz said she ``wanted to have a
baby. ... She has fantasized a pregnancy for quite some time now.
She's on maternity leave from some job somewhere.''
   Little Starla Katrice was taken from the second-floor maternity
ward at about noon Thursday, said Steve Nussbaum, a senior vice
president at the hospital.
   Authorities arrested Mrs. Chrushshon at her home, and at about 8
p.m. brought her and the child to the police station, where her
mother, Yvette Hamtak, was waiting.
   The infant appeared to be in good health, said hospital
spokeswoman Ann Sosnoski.
   ``I just thank God that she's here,'' said Ms. Hamtak. ``God,
I'm so happy. I just feel I can breathe now.''
   Hospital officials said the abductor was wearing a nurse's
uniform when she told Ms. Hamtak that she was taking the infant for
a measles shot. The woman then calmly walked out of the hospital
with the baby, Nussbaum said.
   Witnesses reported that a woman, believed to be the infant's
abductor, had been hanging around the maternity ward for several
hours. Ed Martin, the abducted baby's father, said the woman had
walked into the mother's room at least three times.

   Attackers armed with grenades and a
machine gun damaged two U.N. buildings and killed a black Namibian
security guard, police and U.N. officials said today.
   The Thursday night attacks occurred at U.N. posts in Outjo, a
town 210 miles north of Windhoek, police said.
   ``I expect all Namibians to unite in the condemnation of such
acts and to reaffirm their commitment to a peaceful transition to
independence,'' said Martti Ahtisaari, who heads the U.N.
monitoring team overseeing the territory's independence process.
   The attackers threw two grenades into an office, killing a
22-year-old Namibian working for a private security firm and
setting fire to the building, police said. U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said it appeared a machine gun also was used.
   Two white men and one black man were suspected of carrying out
the attack, police said.
   The alleged getaway vehicle was stopped at a police roadblock,
and crudely painted U.N. initials were noticed on the sides, but
the vehicle sped away, said Gerhard Roux, a spokesman for the
territorial administrator, Louis Pienaar.
   U.N. officials reported a second attack at a nearby U.N.
military base where arms are stored. There was minimal damage to
the building, and no injuries, the officials said.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia for 74 years, agreed to
grant independence to Africa's last colony under a regional peace
accord signed in December. More than 6,000 U.N. military and
civilian personnel are monitoring the year-long process.
   Despite various problems, the plan is on schedule, according to
U.N. officials. Elections are set for November and independence is
expected early next year.

   A special cross-border police unit nabbed a
Lebanese man accused of being a drug kingpin and whisked him to
Israel, officials said today.
   Thursday night's operation came exactly two weeks after Israeli
commandos abducted a Shiite Moslem clergyman in south Lebanon and
flew him to Israel.
   The capture of Mohammed Berro appeared unrelated to Obeid's
kidnapping, which was aimed at arranging a prisoner swap.
   Department Chief Rami Zutler of the Severe Crimes Division told
a Tel Aviv court today that Berro is ``one of the biggest'' drug
dealers in Lebanon, the national news agency Itim said.
   The court remanded Berro in custody for 15 days, it said.
   When asked by the judge how Berro, 46, had arrived in Israel
from Lebanon, Zutler replied that the police had ``transferred''
him.
   Zutler alleged that Berro was responsible for smuggling 46.2
pounds of heroin seized last week in Israel's biggest drug bust.
   Zutler also said Berro was wanted by Egypt for drug smuggling.
   Reports from Egypt said that in June, Berro was sentenced in
absentia to death for attempting to smuggle 4.1 tons of opium, 1.8
tons of hashish, and 635 pounds of heroin into Egypt.
   Security sources in Lebanon said Israeli civilian police have
been operating in Israel's self-declared security zone in southern
Lebanon for at least six months.
   Police spokeswoman Ruth Schlesinger said a joint police and
military unit is conducting anti-smuggling operations along
Israel's northern border and in the security zone.
   The zone was carved out by Israel in 1985, after it pulled the
majority of its troops out of Lebanon following the 1982 invasion.
The zone is patrolled by about 1,500 Israeli troops backed by
Israel's militia allies.
   There are approximately 5,000 drug addicts receiving treatment
in Israel, but there are no accurate figures on the numbers of drug
users in the country. The supply of drugs coming in from Lebanon
has risen sharply in recent years.
   Until 1978, drug usage in Israel was confined to hashish,
traditionally smuggled from Lebanon. But in 1982, Lebanese dealers
began to produce heroin and Israeli drug dealers began distributing
it.
   The contact was made easier after Israel's invasion of Lebanon.

   The spiritual guide of the pro-Iranian
group Hezbollah today offered to help free Western hostages held in
Lebanon if the West helps release Arab prisoners held in Israel.
   ``Let us get to an agreement together so that each side would
use his own means and influence to end the crisis of the hostages,
all hostages, and resolve the problem of Arab prisoners,'' said
Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah during a sermon at Beirut's Bir
el-Abed Mosque.
   ``I am ready to help free the Western hostages provided that
Western countries help release Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners
in Israel,'' he said.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for Shiite Moslem
factions holding most of the 16 hostages in Lebanon.
   Fadlallah did not mention any names, but his comments were
similar to an offer made earlier this month by the Revolutionary
Justice Organization, a pro-Iranian group that holds American
hostage Joseph Cicippio.
   It said it would free Cicippio if Israel freed Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid, a Shiite Moslem clergyman Israel kidnapped July 28, and 450
Arab prisoners. It also demanded that Israel allow 55 Palestinians
deported in connection with the anti-Israeli uprising in the
occupied territories to return home.
   During his speech, Fadlallah also praised a bombing attack
carried out by a Shiite Moslem cleric in retaliation for Israel's
abduction of Obeid.
   Five Israeli soldiers and an allied militiaman were injured
Wednesday when a Shiite Moslem clergyman, Sheik Asaad Birro,
detonated a truck bomb as an Israeli military patrol passed in
southern Lebanon. Birro was killed.
   ``Sheik Asaad Birro has, by his attack, knocked down the theory
of a security zone,'' Fadlallah said, referring to the 6- to
10-mile-wide strip of land Israel carved out in south Lebanon to
protect itself from guerrilla raids.
   Hezbollah also released a videotape made of Birro before the
attack.
   In it, Birro said, ``My operation is a gift for the nation of
Hezbollah...and the heroes of the uprising against the cancerous
nation (Israel).''
   ``I hope it will be a modest step toward the elimination of the
Zionist entity,'' he added. Birro appeared nervous, stumbling on
some words as he tensely clutched a prepared text.
   In Israel today, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told U.S.
congressmen he is optimistic Israel can negotiate the release of
missing Israeli soldiers and American hostages in Lebanon.
   Rep. John Hiler told reporters after the hour-long meeting that
Shamir said ``he was hopeful what was taking place would lead to
the release'' of the captives.
   The Indiana Republican attended the session with Rep. Robert
Clement, a Democrat from Tennessee, and Rep. William Emerson, a
Republican from Missouri. They are touring Israel as guests of the
Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith.
   Hiler quoted Shamir as saying ``there were ongoing
negotiations,'' but he gave no specifics. Officials have said
contacts with Shiite Moslems have been made but no negotiations
were under way.
   The foreign hostages include eight Americans. The hostage held
longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   On July 31, a pro-Iranian group claimed it killed one hostage,
U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, in retaliation for
Israel's refusal to free Obeid.
   Israel said it kidnapped Obeid to swap him for three Israeli
soldiers held in south Lebanon and the Western hostages.
   Fadlallah made his comments in a sermon marking the anniversary
of the death of Shiite Moslems' most revered saint, Imam Hussein
bin Ali, grandson of the prophet Mohammed.
   He was killed in 680 B.C. by Sunni Moslem armies after a 10-day
siege in Karbala, in what is now Iraq.

<HEAD>Plane Lands Safely At Newark International With Hydraulics Problem</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with Braniff saying bad warning light caused uncheduled
landing. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Braniff Airways flight from New York to
Florida made a safe emergency landing at Newark International
Airport today after a warning light indicated a hydraulics problem,
officials said.
   ``We had nothing but a faulty warning system,'' said Braniff
spokesman Don McGuire in Orlando, Fla.
   He said the incident drew exaggerated attention after an airport
spokesman reported that the Boeing 727's primary hydraulic system
failed and that the plane landed using a secondary system. McGuire
said it was the warning light, not the system itself, that had
failed.
   Rescue crews stood by as the plane landed safely about 9:30 a.m.
   One passenger, Robert Schoeppler of New York, said that after
landing, the captain announced one of the hydraulics systems
``conked out.''
   There were 99 passengers and a crew of seven aboard Flight 341,
which had taken off a short time before from New York's La Guardia
Airport, bound for Orlando.
   Hydraulics systems enable the pilot to operate the wing flaps
and other equipment. Large jets are designed so if one fails, the
plane can still fly on backup hydraulics systems.
   A failure of all three hydraulics systems on a DC-10 en route
from Denver to Chicago was blamed for last month's crash landing of
a United Airlines jet at Sioux City, Iowa, that killed 111 people.
In that case, the systems failed after an engine disintegrated in
flight and bits of metal damaged the hydraulics lines.

   William C. Lucas, whose nomination as the
government's civil rights chief died earlier this month in the
Senate, today was named to a Justice Department post that does not
require confirmation by lawmakers.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh named Lucas, a former FBI
agent and sheriff of Wayne County, Mich., as director of the
department's office of liaison services.
   The appointment eliminates a potential source of friction
between the Bush administration and the Democratic majority of the
Senate. The Senate Judiciary Committee killed Lucas' selection as
assistant attorney general for civil rights on a tie vote, and also
refused to permit the full Senate to vote on it.
   Bush had been urged by some Republicans to name Lucas, a black,
to the high-ranking post during the current congressional recess, a
move that would have allowed him to serve until the end of next
year without confirmation. Democratic leaders expressed strong
opposition to such a move in a White House session with the
president.
   Opponents to his earlier nomination said Lucas lacked a strong
commitment to civil rights concerns, and said he didn't have the
experience needed for such an important administrative job.
   Lucas' new job will make him coordinator of Justice Department
activities with state and local governments and civil rights
organizations.
   Thornburgh said in a statement that Lucas, 61, ``will be in
charge of coordinating cooperative efforts in law enforcement,
civil rights and the administration of justice with our working
partners in both the public and private sectors.''
   Lucas ``will act as my personal representative in dealing with
persons and organizations on those matters,'' Thornburgh said.
   Administration sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Bush would formally withdraw Lucas' nomination for the civil
rights job later today. No replacement has been selected, they said.
   In 7-7 tie votes Aug. 1, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected
motions to recommend Lucas' confirmation and to send his name to
the full Senate without recommendation.
   Bush had considered appointing Lucas to the civil rights post
while Congress is in recess, a manuever that would have permitted
Lucas to serve through 1990 without requiring a Senate vote.
   However, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, warned
Bush a week ago that such a move could harm the president's
relations with Congress.
   Bush then sought a quick floor vote on Lucas before senators
left town, but Mitchell turned him down.
   Lucas, who served as a sheriff and county executive in the
Detroit area, was widely criticized by civil rights groups for
lacking the experience in discrimination cases required for the
assistant attorney general post.
   Lucas has recently been working in the Justice Department as a
consultant.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Bush ``values Mr. Lucas' friendship and advice, and will seek it
and use it in the years ahead.''
   Fitzwater said the president continues to believe that the
rejection by Lucas on Capitol Hill for the high-profile civil
rights post was ``a very unfair judgment by Congress based
primarily on political considerations.''
   ``The president thinks he was an excellent candidate who would
do a great for whoever he works for,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``He was a black leader in Michigan, who gave up the Democratic
Party and joined the Republican Party. We felt his background and
experience was sound, and he would have done a great job.''

<HEAD>Distress May Spur Immune System in AIDS-Infected Men, Study Says
^Eds: For release at 3 p.m. EDT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychological distress may stimulate the
disease-fighting immune system in men with early AIDS virus
infection, the opposite of its apparent effect in people with
full-blown AIDS, a study suggests.
   That may mean the impact of anxiety, depression and fatigue
depends on how well the immune system is able to respond to such
distress, said researcher Lydia Temoshok.
   It also fits in with a recent suggestion that the AIDS virus may
over-stimulate the immune system early on, leading to its later
exhaustion and collapse, she said. If that is true, strategies to
spur the immune system of infected people may have to be timed to
avoid over-stimulation, she said.
   AIDS kills by crippling the body's immune system, leaving a
person vulnerable to fatal illnesses. Some researchers are studying
whether programs to help deal with stress can help infected people
maintain their immune systems, possibly slowing the progression of
the disease or increasing survival times.
   Temoshok is a senior scientist at the Walter Reed Army Institute
of Research in Washington. She did the new research at the
University of California at San Francisco with colleagues there and
from the University of California at Los Angeles.
   She spoke in an interview before presenting the work Friday at
the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association.
   Arthur LaPerriere, research assistant professor of psychiatry at
the University of Miami School of Medicine, called Temoshok's study
preliminary. But he said it may indicate that psychological
intervention can affect the immune systems of people at the stage
of infection she studied.
   Research at his school found that infected men who had no
symptoms showed an increase in immune system white blood cells
after participating in a program that included progressive muscle
relaxation and psychological therapies, he said.
   Temoshok said her work shows only a correlation between distress
levels and activity of the immune system, suggesting but not
proving any cause and effect.
   Previously, her work had linked higher levels of psychological
distress with lower levels of immune system activity in men with
full-blown acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   But just the opposite relationship appeared in the new study of
103 men who showed at least one AIDS-related symptom but not the
full disease.
   Distress was measured with standard tests of anxiety, depression
and fatigue. Measures of the immune system included numbers of
T-cells, which are white blood cells that are a key target of the
AIDS virus, and of other white cells. Researchers also measured the
potency of immune system blood cells called natural killer cells.
   Most immune system measures were significantly higher in men
with more anxiety, depression and fatigue, Temoshok said.
   Other studies suggest that distress has the opposite effect on
healthy people, whose immune systems become depressed.
   The researchers do not yet know if the stimulated immune system
has any effect on the progression to full-blown AIDS, she said. So
it is not clear what psychological treatment, if any, would be
useful, she said.
   A possible explanation for the divergent findings of the two
studies is that the impact of distress may depend on the immune
system of a person infected with the AIDS virus, she said.
   Perhaps the relatively well-functioning immune system of a
person with only early AIDS symptoms responds by being stimulated,
while the more crippled immune system of a person with full-blown
AIDS can only be suppressed, she said.

<HEAD>Border Guards: East Germany Lifted Shoot-to-Kill Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former East German border guards who fled to
the West said Friday that communist authorities have ordered
frontier patrols not to shoot at escaping civilians.
   The shoot-to-kill orders were lifted in April and East German
border guards have been told to use their weapons only in
self-defense, to prevent desertions, and in cases where would-be
escapees used ``heavy equipment'' to break through the heavily
fortified border, the two said.
   East Germany's Communist party leader Erich Honecker told the
Washington Post in June that the orders had been lifted.
   Falk Turba, a former border guard who escaped July 12, said that
according to his superiors, the killing of would-be escapees caused
``more political damage than if the escape suceeded.''
   Former guard Carsten Kuehnast said the new orders were imprecise
since they did not specify what was considered to be ``heavy
equipment.''
   Working Group August 13, an organization that monitors human
rights in East Germany, said that since the wall's construction in
1961, 191 East Germans died in escape attempts. According to its
latest figures, 218,283 East Germans have succeeded, including
2,614 military personnel.

<TEXT>
   An East German Interflug jet
arrived Friday in this West German business center, completing the
first exchange of commerical flights in the 40 years since the
nation was divided.
   Heinz Ruhnau, head of West Germany's Lufthansa airline that
inaugurated a Frankfurt-to-Leipzig service Thursday, deemed the new
routes ``a step toward normality.''
   But despite the new services aimed at shuttling passengers from
both sides among the major business cities, a remnant of the Cold
War continues to encumber both national carriers: Neither Lufthansa
nor Interflug is allowed to fly over the border between the
countries, so they must detour to the south and fly through
Czechoslovak airspace.
   Under a post-World War II agreement among the Western allies,
only France, Britain and the United States are allowed to provide
air service between West Germany and West Berlin, and they must
travel along three closely prescribed routes.

<HEAD>Scaled-Down Fall Exercises For NATO</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 205,000 soldiers, sailors, pilots
and other military personnel will take part in NATO's annual fall
exercises in Western Europe, it was announced Friday.
   The European military command of the 16-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization said ``Autumn Forge 89'' exercises will be
scaled down this year.
   The war games, which span Western Europe from northern Norway to
Turkey, have become increasingly unpopular with the European public
because of their costs, noise and damage to farms and other land.
Many Europeans also question the need for such maneuvers at a time
of warming ties with the East bloc.
   The United States already has postponed until next year its
``Reforger'' _ ``Return of Forces to Germany'' _ maneuvers. The
exercises had been set for September to test the ability to send
troops and supplies to Europe in the event of war.
   U.S. troops stationed in Europe will still participate in this
year's Autumn Forge exercises.
   NATO's European command said fewer forces will be assigned to
this year's war games. About 250,000 troops were involved last year.

   A group calling itself ``The
Seething Spuds'' Friday claimed responsibility for destroying 400
genetically altered potato plants that are part of a research
project, police said.
   The protest caused a delay of at least one year in research at
the Agriculture Ministry's ITAL institute, which planted the
potatoes in June, said institute spokesman Willem Stiekema.
   The potato plants were ripped out of the ground tossed on a heap
early Thursday, according to police spokesman H. Martin. No arrests
were made.
   In a letter to the Dutch national news agency, the group said
the protest was aimed at using genetic manipulation to make
potatoes more resistant to herbicides.
   Stiekema confirmed that one group of potatoes was involved in
such an experiment, adding that another batch had been genetically
manipulated to resist a common potato virus.
   ``In a third type, we implanted two (manipulated) gens that we
reseachers can play around with a little,'' Stiekma said.
   ITAL is one of several biotechnological research institutes in
this central Dutch city.

   Central Newspapers Inc., the newspaper chain
owned by Vice President Dan Quayle's family, is going public with
an initial offering of more than 3.5 million shares of common stock.
   The Indianapolis-based company, founded by Quayle's grandfather,
publishes papers in Arizona and Indiana, according to Thursday's
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Neither the vice president nor his wife, Marilyn, was listed in
the SEC filing as a selling shareholder.
   Existing shareholders who are selling some of their stock
include Quayle's mother, Corinne Pulliam Quayle, and Huntington
Newspapers Inc., which puts out the Huntington Herald-Press, a
northern Indiana daily published by the vice president's father,
James C. Quayle.
   The company won't receive any of the proceeds from the stock
offering.
   Phoenix Newspapers Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary, publishes
The Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette. A 70 percent-owned
subsidiary, Indianapolis Newspapers Inc., publishes The
Indianapolis Star and The Indianapolis News.
   Central Newspapers also publishes three smaller papers in
Muncie, Ind., and Vincennes, Ind., and a business weekly in Arizona.
   The stock offering consists of 3 million shares of Class A
common stock to be sold in the United States and 592,800 shares of
Class A to be offered outside the country.
   After the stock sale, Central Newspapers outstanding stock will
consist of 23.16 million shares of Class A common stock and 33.27
million shares of Class B common stock.
   Each Class A common stock share has 10 times the dividend and
liquidation rights of Class B common shares. However, Class B
shares have 10 times the voting power of Class A.
   All the Class B shares will be retained by current shareholders,
including the Eugene C. Pulliam Trust, which holds 68.85 percent of
the stock. The trust is named for Quayle's grandfather, who died in
1975.
   Holders of Class A shares were reducing their holdings by only a
fraction.
   DePauw University, Quayle's alma mater, will sell only 181,818
of its 300,000 shares. Quayle's mother will sell just 36,363 of her
659,600 shares, according to documents filed with the SEC.
   The offering was approved late last month by shareholders as
part of a recapitalization plan. The Eugene C. Pulliam Trust, which
has had voting control since 1965, permitted the plan as long as it
retains at least 53.77 percent voting power.
   Pulliam, the vice president's grandfather, was publisher of the
two Indianapolis papers. His son, Eugene S. Pulliam, Quayle's
uncle, is the current publisher.
   Central Newspapers reported net income of about $29 million last
year on revenues of nearly $418 million.

   The Bush administration said today it wants to
take a lower profile on efforts to free American hostages in
Lebanon while ``discussions flow back and forth.''
   Bush has a sense of urgency on ``the overall situation, but the
most important traits right now are patience and determination, to
not let urgency push you to say things or do things that would be
counterproductive,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We just don't have anything new today. It's a long process and
we need to be patient and let discussions flow back and forth ...
but there's just no new developments,'' he told reporters.
   ``We would like to lower our voices a little and let these
issues play out for a few days and see what happens,'' Fitzwater
said.
   He was asked about remarks in Beirut by the spiritual guide of
the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
who offered to help free Western hostages held in Lebanon if the
West helps release Arab prisoners held in Israel.
   ``It's an interesting statement. We don't have any comment on
it. ... We hope it signals their desire to release the hostages,''
he said.
   Fitzwater said there appeared to be no prospects for talks with
the Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella organization for Shiite
Moslem factions holding most of the 16 hostages in Lebanon.
   ``We always said we'd talk to anybody and seek any avenue for
getting the release of the hostages, but there's never really been
an opportunity for direct discussions'' with the hostage holders,
Fitzwater said. ``Partly they haven't wanted to. We've said we
won't negotiate for hostages. It just hasn't been fruitful.''
   Fitzwater said Thursday that the administration stands ready to
talk to any party that can help win freedom for the Middle East
hostages _ including Iran _ but it is premature to expect direct
talks with the new government in Tehran.
   ``We want to keep the lines of communication open,'' he said.
``We are prepared to talk to any party that can help with release
of the hostages, including Iran.''
   To talk directly with Tehran, however, he added, the United
States would have to be sure it was dealing with ``authoritative
officials who represented the government.'' He suggested it was
premature to expect such talks now, adding, ``We're nowhere near
that.''
   Bush himself had nothing to say Thursday about the hostages,
expect to repeat his appeal to Americans to offer a special prayer
for them this weekend.
   Fitzwater said the United States welcomes third-party contacts
with Iran on the hostages, including a trip to Tehran planned next
week by the foreign minister of Pakistan, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan.
   Fitzwater, taking note of a report Thursday in the
English-language Tehran Times that indirect talks would open in a
few days through a third country, possibly Pakistan, said he was
unaware of any ``special new talks.''
   Fitzwater said Khan and other Pakistani officials have contacts
in Iran and it is the administration's policy ``to leave no stone
unturned'' in seeking to win freedom of the U.S. hostages.
   Fitzwater said he could not supply details of Khan's trip. Khan
made an unexpected visit to Washington last week, where he met with
Vice President Dan Quayle.
   The vice president ``urged Pakistan to become involved in
helping facilitate the release of the hostages and to reveal to
Iran information that Pakistan has accumulated on the situation,''
said Quayle spokesman David Beckwith.
   Fitzwater told reporters the United States and Israel were
discussing efforts to free their hostages in Lebanon, but were not
coordinating their actions.
   Israeli officials had said Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir persuaded Bush in a 10-minute telephone call Wednesday to
coordinate efforts to release foreign hostages and Israeli
prisoners held in Lebanon.
   ``We've generally tried to be forthcoming with what we are
doing, and they have been forthcoming with what they're doing.
However, I would not characterize it as coordination,'' Fitzwater
said.

   A former United Mine Workers official serving
life in prison for his role in the 1969 slayings of union dissident
Joseph ``Jock'' Yablonski and his family has died in his cell,
officials said today.
   William Prater was found at 6:10 a.m. today at the State
Correctional Institution at Dallas in Luzerne County. A prison
spokesman said Prater, who was 70, apparently died of natural
causes.
   ``He had been in poor health for some time,'' spokesman Roy
VanWhy said. Prater had been confined to a wheelchair since
suffering a stroke in 1983.
   Prater was sentenced in 1973 and was serving three life
sentences for the murders.
   Yablonski, 59, was shot to death along with his wife, Margaret,
57, and their 25-year-old daughter, Charlotte, at their Clarksville
home in southwestern Pennsylvania on New Year's Eve 1969. Yablonski
had lost an election for UMW president earlier that December.
   His opponent, then-incumbent UMW president, W.A. ``Tony'' Boyle,
was later convicted of ordering the assassination. His first
conviction was overturned and he was convicted a second time. Boyle
died in May 1985 while serving three life terms.
   Prater, formerly of LaFollette, Tenn., was accused of helping to
plan the killing and he later cooperated with prosecutors in
convicting Boyle. Prater, a midlevel union official, was accused of
helping to gather $20,000 in union funds to pay for the killings.
   Three men accused of carrying out the killings, Aubran ``Buddy''
Martin, Claude Vealey and Paul Gilly, were all convicted and
sentenced to life in prison.
   Prater served 16 years in a federal prison before being paroled.
He was transferred to the state prison at Pittsburgh in September
1988 to serve life terms imposed under state law and was moved to
Dallas later that year.
   VanWhy said the body was released to the Luzerne County coroner.

   Thunderstorms crossing from California into Nevada today left
homes flooded, mudslides imperiled Yellowstone visitors and
Arizona's governor toured areas of Yuma where ``there were lakes
where cars had been.''
   Widely scattered downpours Wednesday and Thursday deluged areas
from San Diego to Las Vegas. The aqueduct supplying most of Los
Angeles' water overflowed. Some roads and highways in the eastern
Sierra Nevada range, where deputies rescued several motorists from
high water, remained closed today.
   Heavy rain and hail at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., caused
three major mudslides and 12 smaller ones that mired 30 vehicles in
waist-deep mud and swept one family inside of a camper into a
raging river Thursday evening.
   ``It was a matter of seconds, virtually seconds, and that
vehicle would have gone under,'' said park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo
after talking to a park ranger who rescued the family visiting from
Mexico.
   No one was injured, but Paul Lauze, a meteorologist for the
National Weather Service in Cheyenne, cautioned that there could be
more slides today. ``Everybody watch out. It's going to be the same
thing,'' he said.
   ``The problem is aggravated in Yellowstone National Park because
of the exposed terrain as the result of the forest fires last
year,'' he said.
   Arizona Gov. Rose Mofford declared Yuma County a disaster area
Thursday after touring areas where homes were flooded by up to 4
feet of water from a storm Wednesday night. The desert town got
more rain in an evening _ about 3{ inches _ than it normally gets
in a year.
   ``There were lakes where cars had been, and you could tell that
businesses were wiped out,'' Mrs. Mofford said.
   Police threatened to ticket sightseers who drove through
floodwaters, creating waves that washed into homes and businesses.
   Police spokesman Jan Schmidt estimated 1,000 homes were damaged,
but said there were no estimates of monetary losses this morning.
   ``People are still digging out to figure out what got ruined,''
he said. ``We have homes that had four feet of water in them. I
know one man who had a swimming pool seven feet deep that was
covered with sand. He was standing on top of it; it was filled in.''
   He said the National Weather Service reading of 3.5 inches of
rain on a mesa overlooking the city was conservative.
   ``Down in the valley, they had about 5.6 inches in 2{ hours,''
Schmidt said.
   ``On the south side of town, they lost just about all the water
pressure because the water eroded away the areas, and what was left
fell down and crushed the pipes,'' Schmidt said.
   Damage also was reported at the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station,
in the desert just southeast of California, where 2,000 gallons of
firefighting foam leaked during the storm. ``It was like a washing
machine gone wild,'' Gunnery Sgt. Hal Wheeler said.
   In Mono County, Calif., between Yosemite National Park and the
Nevada line, about 150 residents were evacuated Thursday, and at
least 28 homes suffered moderate to severe water damage, Sheriff
Marty Strelneck said.
   A one-mile section of the Los Angeles Aqueduct that had been
closed because of previous flooding filled with rain again and
overflowed, forcing a cleanup crew of 30 to evacuate, officials
said.
   The section runs near the towns of Olancha and Cartago, 180
miles north of Los Angeles.
   The aqueduct supplies 75 percent of Los Angeles' water, but
reservoirs in the area have enough water to prevent a shortage in
Los Angeles, said Dorothy Jensen, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles
city water department.

<HEAD>10 Fishermen Survive 24-Day Ordeal Afloat on High Seas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten Chinese fishermen survived a 24-day ordeal
aboard tiny, typhoon-tossed sampans by eating cardboard and
drinking rainwater, but 14 others perished, a report appearing
Friday said.
   On Wednesday, the survivors sailed into the southern Chinese
port of Zhuhai adjacent to the Portuguese enclave of Macao about 40
miles southwest of this British colony, the official China News
Service reported.
   According to the news service, the ordeal began July 17 when the
Maowan No. 1, a fishing vessel from Taishan in southern China,
caught fire in the vicinity of the Paracel islands, also known as
the Xisha islands, about 450 miles south of Hong Kong.
   The 24 crewmen had to abandon ship and board two small sampans.
They had no food but ate cardboard television packing cartons that
were in the vessels. They drank sea water and rainwater.
   A surviving fishermen said he ate a small piece of packing
carton and three mouthfuls of rainwater, the news agency said in
its report from Zhuhai.
   Fourteen men died of hunger, exposure and heat as the sampans
were buffeted by four typhoons in the South China Sea, the report
said. The last casualty was the captain, who died on the 18th day.
   One survivor said that on the 22nd day, the fishermen arrived at
the Pratas islands, also known as the Dongsha islands, about 170
miles west of Hong Kong. Taiwan soldiers occupying the island gave
the Chinese candy and canned food.
   The survivors are undergoing treatment at Zhuhai City People's
Hospital for exhaustion but are out of danger, the report said.

<TEXT>
   Postal workers from across Southern
California volunteered to help their co-workers today at an office
where a mail carrier killed two friends after shooting his wife to
death, then turned the gun on himself.
   At the Orange Glen substation where John Merlin Taylor's
unexplained attack took place Thursday morning, three psychologists
were on hand today to encourage workers to share their emotions
about the lingering terror. Two more psychologists were at the main
Escondido post office.
   ``Several people have taken up the offer for formal
counseling,'' postal spokesman Ken Boyd said. ``But there's more
informal couseling. Several counselors are on the workroom floor
and employees can just come up to them for a conversation, talk
about it, get their feelings out.''
   Taylor, 52, described as a model employee, killed his wife at
home Thursday before shooting to death two co-workers at the post
office, said police Lt. Earl Callander. He then turned the gun on
himself, Callander said.
   He was listed in grave condition on life-support equipment at
Palomar Memorial Hospital today, said the hospital's night
supervisor, Ellen Satkoski.
   Postal clerk William Karlson said returning to work was a
terrible task, but, ``we just have to do it.''
   Mail delivery resumed today for about 26,000 households and
businesses served by the post office, where the mood was somber and
restrained. Letter carriers from as far away as Anaheim and Los
Angeles, 80 miles from this San Dego County city, volunteered to
work on their days off, Boyd said.
   ``We normally have 48 carriers out of this office,'' he said.
``There's at least 25 extra working today.''
   Police were checking leads that suggested family problems may
have played a role in his shooting spree. The 52-year-old letter
carrier shot his wife, Elizabeth, to death at their Escondido home
before going to the substation in northern San Diego County.
   ``We have no indication he was looking for a specific person or
a target,'' said Callander.
   On Tuesday, Taylor and co-worker Johnny Sims discussed a 1986
incident in which part-time letter carrier Patrick Sherrill killed
14 people and himself in a post office in Edmond, Okla.
   ``We were talking about something and got around to saying,
`What if something happened to one of the employees that would have
gotten him mad and to go berserk?' We were just joking around,''
said Sims, who wasn't at work when the shooting occurred. He said
he was surprised by Taylor's violent spree.
   ``John was a happy-go-lucky guy always. You could never make him
mad,'' he said.
   Taylor, who received numerous model-employee awards during his
27 years with the Postal Service, entered the office armed for a
long siege, police said.
   ``He fired well over a dozen rounds and there are expended cases
all over the floor,'' said Callander. ``There is also a box of
about 100 rounds that apparently was going to be used for
reloading.''
   When he arrived at 7:30 a.m., Taylor shot co-workers Ron
Williams, 56, and Richard Berni, 38, who were sitting on a bench
near a side entrance to the building, police said. Both men died.
   He then went inside and began firing randomly, wounding clerk
30-year-old Paul Derisi in the arm, they said.
   Taylor reloaded and then walked past custodian Reginald Keith.
   ``I saw him after he reloaded the gun and he came about four or
five feet from me,'' Keith said. ``He was in a daze and had the gun
pointed to the ground. I just turned around and walked out the back
real quick.''
   Taylor fired the weapon several more times before shooting
himself in the head, Callander said.
   Taylor recently was considered for another employee honor, but
he declined the nomination and asking that the award be given to
someone else, said Bob Henley, the postal station manager.
   ``I've had communications with John Taylor and I told him,
`John, if all my employees were as good as you, I'd be the
Postmaster General by now,''' Henley said.
   Henley said Taylor pointed the gun at him and shot in his
direction, but said, ``I'm not going to shoot you.''
   After the shooting, authorities went to Taylor's home and found
his 50-year-old wife in bed, dead from multiple gunshot wounds.
   Derisi was treated at Palomar hospital and released. Phyllis
Devito, 37, of Escondido was released after treatment for facial
cuts, hospital spokeswoman Pat Rarus said.

   A storm knocked out power to the rail line
along France's Mediterranean coast, stranding about 12,000
passengers overnight, railroad officials said Friday.
   Trains began running again about 9 a.m. Friday, more than 12
hours after the storm interrupted service.
   The national railroad apologized for the problem and invited
inconvenienced customers to apply for refunds or replacement
tickets.
   Transport Minister Michel Delebarre said he would ask the
railroad to explain what went wrong and to propose ways that
travelers could be better informed in such cases.
   Passengers complained on French radio that they were were told
the trains could start again at any minute, but ended up waiting
all night. Some eventually took buses, called taxis or walked to
nearby highways to hitch rides.

<TEXT>
   When he was a kid, Ken Bessette Jr. didn't
play baseball or basketball.
   He raced cars. Well, soap box derby cars. He assembled parts in
his basement and talked shop with mechanics at the Vermont Transit
Co. Inc. garage where his father worked.
   ``I remember coming home from school in the afternoon and
working right up until suppertime,'' Bessette said. That was the
early 1950s. And even all these years later, Bessette remembers the
thrill zipping down a hill at 35 miles per hour in a 14-inch tall
car.
   His dream then was to attend the All American Soap Box Derby in
Akron, Ohio, the Olympic Games for soap box racers. And even though
he came close on several occasions, he never made it.
   Until this year.
   Bessette, who is attending the derby as part of the Vermont
delegation, is part of what race organizers call a resurgence in
the event that dates to the early 1930s.
   Jeff Iula of the All-American Soap Box Derby said the race had
its heyday in the late 1960s, but is making a comeback now as the
children of the baby boom generation begin to filter into the ranks.
   He said there are about 5,000 participants and qualifying races
nationwide this year. The finals are set for Saturday.
   Vermont, for example, hadn't held a race since 1985, and hadn't
held one in the state's largest city since the 1950s. But when
Bessette heard about the return of the soap box derby to Vermont,
he was ready to roll.
   His youngest child is 26 _ too old to race. Undeterred, Bessette
rounded up two neighbors, Erik and Travis Holcomb, and suggested
they enter.
   Bessette would say that helping build the two cars was done
mostly for the kids. Don't be fooled. He enjoyed this as much as
they did.
   ``Cars are my thing,'' he said.
   A section of Bessette's garage was taken over by soap box
construction. The aroma of new paint hung in the air and odd wood
pieces are tossed in piles. Atop one pile is the critical rule book
and a road atlas-sized instruction book on building the racer.
   These days, everything is done according to stringent
specifications in an attempt to make the race more even-handed.
   ``Some kids may have a dad that's an IBM engeiner while other
kids might have a dad that doesn't have that experience,'' Bessette
said.
   Erik and Travis can recite those rules and guidelines as easily
as their address. They know a car in their division can't weigh
more than 206 pounds with one type of wheel, can't be longer than
80 inches and can't be less than 13 inches wide.
   The wooden contraptions aren't exactly furnished with fuel
injection and front disc brakes. Gravity is the force that propels
the cars down the selected hill while the brake is a piece of
rubber bolted to a stick of wood that drops out of the floor like a
trap door and drags along the ground.
   Derby cars have come a long way from the boxy models that once
dotted the soap box circuit. The Holcombs' cars looked like short
kayaks with wheels. The front of each car has a rounded nose _ like
submarines and raindrops _ to cut down on air drag, the two boys
said.
   ``You can get fooled too,'' Bessette warned. ``Sometimes a
shoebox will clean house.''
   But the basic tenets of the race haven't really changed, even
though the cars have, said Harley Burger, of the Green Mountain
Council Boy Scouts of America Inc., an organizer of the Vermont
rally.
   ``They ran down a hill then, they run down a hill now,'' Burger
said. ``The winner went to Akron then, the winner goes now.''
   Bessette took the experience of being a soap box racer and built
on it. He owns a garage and has worked as a member of a pit crew
for professional stock car racers.
   And this year, he raced at the derby in an oversized car
designed for adults. He said it was tough to scrunch down into a
little ball and fit into the car, but it all came back to him. He
beat a fellow Vermonter, Norman Turcotte.
   ``I won a race at the derby,'' Bessette said with glee. ``Boy
that was really exciting. It really made my day.''

   A frustrated spokeswoman for Rep. Mickey
Leland said today she wasn't satisfied with the ``sense of
urgency'' involved in the search for her boss and others missing
since Monday in Ethiopia.
   President Bush and the State Department said they understood the
worried mood of the Texas congressman's staff and defended the
rescue effort.
   Leland's press secretary, Alma Newsom, said that with all of
sophisticated equipment dispatched to Ethiopia to search for the
congressman's missing plane and his traveling party, ``we could
have and should have located them by now.''
   ``I certainly had a great deal more confidence in our
capability,'' she said. Leland's plane, which also carried several
congressional staff members and State Department employees,
vanished Monday after taking off from Addis Ababa for a refugee
camp 480 miles away.
   Leland, D-Texas, chairs the House Select Committee on Hunger and
has been a leader in congressional efforts to aid people displaced
by war and famine in Africa.
   Ms. Newsom said she was appealing to Bush to get involved, ``and
to issue a strong statement to all of his people, that this is a
priority, they've got to work together and they have got to get
their act together and find Congressman Leland and his party.''
   The president, asked about the subject at a photo session in the
Oval Office said:
   ``I can understand the anxiety of all this and I can understand
the concern that people that love Mickey Leland feel and that I
feel. But there's a lot going on, so let's just hope and pray he's
OK.''
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said ``I
know the president and the secretary of state deeply and sincerely
empathize with the frustration, with the tension, with the
situation (Ms. Newsom is) having to deal with ....''
   Ms. Newsom said, ``I think there has been a problem of
communication. I think there has been a problem of somehow, the
sense of urgency from the top has not filtered considerably as it
went down.''
   ``There's an obvious leadership or organizational vacuum here,
... there's a missing link,'' she said.
   Ms. Tutwiler also denied there had been any breakdown in the
search effort.
   Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo., one of two congressmen sent to Ethiopia
by House Speaker Thomas Foley, was briefed on the situation
Thursday, and Ms. Newsom said there was a ``general acknowledgment
that more facilities were needed, that more aircraft were needed,
that more helicopters were needed. That particularly more personnel
were needed. That there were fliers needed, pilots needed to spell
the ones that are there.''
   Ms. Newsom said she and others in Leland's office had spent the
night calling on other congressmen to urge the Pentagon to move
more quickly on the rescue effort, saying time was of the essence
and that there had been ``a lot of missteps'' and misstatements.

   A woman was killed with gunfire from a passing
vehicle as she took her 17-year-old son to testify at a
drug-related court hearing, police said.
   The prosecutor said he had hoped the teen-ager, who was wounded
in the attack, would testify in juvenile court against two
Washington, D.C., men charged with contributing to the delinquency
of a minor by encouraging cocaine distrubution. The youth is also
charged in the case.
   Anne Louise Gordon, 32, of Washington, D.C., died at the scene
from a single gunshot wound to the head after Thursday morning's
shooting, police said.
   Her 17-year-old son was shot in the neck and was reported in
fair condition at Fauquier Hospital in Warrenton. A second
passenger in the car, a 13-year-old boy, was not hurt.
   The shooting occurred on U.S. 29 about one-half mile south of
here, said state police spokewoman Lucy Caldwell.
   Ms. Caldwell said Ms. Gordon, en route to Charlottesville, was
driving south when a car passed her and one or more shots were
fired from a handgun.
   The injured teen and a second youth faced charges, along with
the two men, Gary Hinkle and Wilson Emory Smith, both 29, stemming
from an incident in which Albermarle police stopped the four May 3
and confiscated small amounts of cocaine and more than $4,300 cash.
   Ford Childress, assistant Albermarle commonwealth's attorney,
said Thursday that he believed that when the group was stopped,
``they'd sold their drugs and were on their way out of town. All
they had left was cash.''
   Childress said he thought the juveniles' statements to police
were enough to convict the two adults and he planned to call the
youths as key witnesses against them on the delinquency charges.
Childress said because of the age of the two juveniles, he could
not reveal what charges they themselves face.
   After the shooting, Hinkle and Smith were questioned Thursday by
state police and released.
   Smith's attorney, Francis Lawrence, said his client voluntarily
underwent a test to determine whether he had recently fired a
firearm and Smith allowed police to search his car.

<TEXT>
   Charlene Richard died 30 years ago today at
the age of 12 from leukemia. Since her death, many believe she has
helped perform miracles, and thousands now would like to have her
canonized.
   Worshipers began arriving at her grave before noon for a Mass
tonight at St. Edward Church. The Rev. Joseph Brennan said 4,000
were expected to attend, representing a growing sentiment among
southern Louisiana Roman Catholics to have the Cajun girl made a
saint.
   ``We put our lawn chairs out early this morning so we would be
sure to get a spot up front,'' said Charlene's mother, Mary
Richard. ``We've been baking all morning to bring food to the hall.
It's a big day, not just for us but for everyone, I guess.''
   Paul Olivier said he planned to attend to honor the memory of
the girl whose miracle, he believes, helped save his own little
girl's life.
   ``We had a child who was a year old and diagnosed as having
cancer of the larynx. The doctors said it was very rare, but it was
a killer. They put her life span at three, four, five months at the
most,'' said Olivier, a retired state policeman. ``Then someone
told us about Charlene and we went to her grave and asked her to
help us.''
   That was in 1970. Today Angela Olivier is a 19-year-old junior
at the University of Southeastern Louisiana.
   ``I would say that is a sign of a miracle,'' Olivier said. ``A
prayer was answered.''
   There is a box beside Charlene's grave where those hoping for
miracles can put their petitions. A light burns at night for those
who make the pilgrimage around the clock.
   Despite the growing adulation she has received since her death,
Charlene was not a remarkable child, said Mrs. Richard.
   ``She was full of life. She liked sports and was always busy
with something. She went to church and said her rosary, but she was
just a normal little girl,'' she said.
   Brennan said it was Charlene's death that made her a saint. He
was chaplain at the Lafayette hospital where she died in 1959.
   ``Charlene taught the world not how to live, but how to die.
Thirty years ago they didn't have the pain medicine they have now
and she died in excruciating pain, but in perfect grace. She became
great at that time,'' he said.
   The ``miracles'' began soon after Charlene's death, according to
the Rev. Floyd Calais.
   Calais, 62, then was the chaplain at a state hospital in
Lafayette, in the heart of Louisiana's Cajun country, when he
prayed to Charlene, asking her to inspire the bishop to assign him
to a parish. He was soon appointed pastor of the church where the
girl was buried, about 155 miles northwest of New Orleans.
   ``When I found out which church I had, the hair on the back of
my neck stood on end,'' he said.
   Lucy and Rogers Courville often visit Charlene's grave to thank
her for saving the life of their daughter, Laurie, now 15, who was
diagnosed as having cancer at age 5. Numerous others have told of
cancer cures over the years.
   The United States has produced only three saints and
canonization is a lengthy process that can take centuries.
   But the Diocese of Lafayette has begun the slow process of
sainthood for Charlene, Calais said. The diocese is collecting
people's stories of how she helped them, the first step to
establishing miracles, he said. If the Vatican considers Charlene a
candidate for sainthood, she will be considered first for
veneration, beatification and finally canonization.
   ``That really doesn't matter. I'm sure that Charlene is a saint.
I'm sure she is in heaven,'' Calais said.
   For those who come to the grave, canonization is just a
formality.
   ``For us, she is already a saint,'' said Wilson Daigle, who
credits Charlene's intercession with helping his wife recover from
a mental illness. ``We talk to her and she understands us.''

<TEXT>
   Panama's foreign minister today asked the
Security Council to send military observers to his country to
prevent the U.S. Army from instigating confrontations as a pretext
for armed intervention.
   Jorge Ritter said U.S. forces have been leaving their bases for
months to harass Panamanian citizens and ``the Republic of Panama
became, de facto, an invasion site in which only the order to fire
is lacking.''
   ``What the situation in Panama calls for is the presence of
military observers, which we hope would be able to go as early as
next Monday.
   ``The testimony of observers, to be designated, will insure that
the reality of the situation cannot be hidden and it will be
recorded in the annals of history as a crime,'' said Ritter.
   The United States, as a permanent member of the Security
Council, would be able to veto any council resolution to send
military observers to Pamama.
   Panama did not have any nation on the council introduce a
resolution, which would be required to send observers.
   In Panama, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on Thursday said his
regime will not yield to U.S. pressure that he quit as Panama's
Defense Forces chief.
   ``Panama will not bow to the law of force that those barbarians
from the North, their lackeys and tame politicians are trying to
impose on it,'' he said Thursday night, referring to his Panamanian
opponents.
   The comments were Noriega's first reaction to a week of
confrontations between his forces and U.S. Southern Command troops
that included arrests on both sides and the blocking of nearby Fort
Amador by American soldiers.
   U.S. troops have been conducting exercises to defend the Panama
Canal under the 1977 treaties, and Noriega's troops in some cases
have been shadowing them.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today
that the recent exercises were routine manuvers, but he
acknowledged they were to some degree a show of force.
   ``We have always said that we would feel free to carry out
exercises in support of our rights under the Panama Canal treaty
... from time to time we do conduct those kind of exercises,'' he
said. ``They're all designed to ensure our rights and acess to
protect the canal.''
   Addressing a group of 20 retired military officers, Noriega
reiterated earlier accusations the United States wants to replace
him with a ``docile'' government to elude treaty obligations to
turn the Panama Canal over to Panama.
   ``You,'' Noriega said pointing at the retired officers, ``are
front-row witnesses of the aggressive and arrogant policies of the
United States towards Panama.'' But he said Panama ``will not bow,
will not humiliate itself, will not give up its project of
liberating itself (of American soldiers) in the face of injustice
or arrogance.''
   The group of officers, believed to have been founded recently by
Noriega, calls itself the executive committee of the Organization
of Military Men for Democracy, Integration and the Liberation of
Latin American and the Caribbean.
   The Bush administration and opposition politicians have been
trying to force out Noriega since two federal grand juries in
Florida indicted him on drug trafficking and money laundering
charges last year.
   U.S efforts have included diplomatic pressure and trade and
economic sanctions against Panama. But the steps have yet to budge
Noriega, whose regime annulled May 7 presidential elections.
International observers said opposition candidate Guillermo Endara

   A letter carrier has pleaded guilty to drug
charges after admitting he took telephone orders at the post office
and delivered cocaine to some customers along his route.
   Isaiah Millings, 33, pleaded guilty Thursday to six drug-related
counts in exchange for a two-year prison sentence.
   Postal inspectors and police secretly filmed Millings as he sold
cocaine while delivering mail and as he transported the drug on
other occasions using his official Postal Service vehicle.
   Police and post inspectors also taped Millings taking cocaine
orders over the telephone at the post office.
   Millings' supplier, Antonio F. Brown, 49, also pleaded guilty
and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Brown, a native of Panama
who entered the United States illegally, has a long criminal record
and was wanted by police in South Carolina for escape.
   Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Elsbeth Levy Bothe and Assistant
State's Attorney Jill Myers said Brown was eligible for a 25-year
sentence without the possibility of parole because of his criminal
history.
   ``As one of the taxpayers of the state of Maryland, I don't want
to support him for the next 25 years,'' Bothe said. ``It's the only
reason I'm willing to not impose the 25 years he so richly
deserves.''
   Myers said after Brown serves his prison time in this country,
he probably will be returned to Panama.
   Postal employees who have drug problems are encouraged to take
advantage of free programs offered by the Postal Service, postal
inspector Jeff L. Fry said.

<HEAD>Forces on Full Alert Before 20th Anniversary Marches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security forces went on full
alert throughout Northern Ireland on Friday before weekend marches
to mark the 20th anniversary of the deployment of British troops in
the province.
   The army and police said they feared the Irish Republican Army
would attempt a terror offensive to mark the occasion.
   Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad on Thursday urged the
public to be particularly vigilant on the British mainland.
   Belfast's mayor, Tony Carlin, said, ``I am sure I am speaking
for everyone in the city when I say that the main concern over the
weekend must be the preservation of peace and calm,'' Carlin said.
   At 5 p.m. on Aug. 14, 1969, 400 soldiers of the Prince of Wales
Own Regiment entered Londonderry, the first soldiers sent in to try
to control sectarian fighting between Protestant and Roman Catholic
extremists.
   The IRA has waged a bloody campaign, primarily in Northern
Ireland, to drive the British out of the predominantly Protestant
province and unite it with the mainly Catholic Irish Republic. So
far, 2,742 people have been killed in the conflict.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke pledged to keep troops
in Ulster ``as long as they were needed.''
   In a radio interview, he said to the IRA: ``You cannot win.''
   The government wanted to continue to work toward a devolution of
power to the province, he said.
   As many as 1,000 mourners, meanwhile, attended the funeral of
Seamus Duffy, a 15-year-old boy killed by a plastic bullet early
Wednesday as he walked home from watching bonfires marking the 18th
anniversary of the start of the British policy of interning
suspected terrorists without trial. The policy was modified in the
following years and the last detainees were released in 1975.
   More than 120 people were evacuated from their homes in the
County Antrim resort of Portrush on Friday after a suspected
booby-trap bomb was found under a policeman's car. An army bomb
disposal expert safely exploded the bomb.
   Police arrested an unspecified number of men in Catholic areas
of Londonderry overnight and took them to an interrogation center
in Belfast for questioning.
   Extra police and troops were being assigned to Londonderry for
Saturday's annual Protestant loyalist Apprentice Boys' parade
marking the 300th anniversary of the Siege of Derry. More than
15,000 Protestant marchers were expected to take part.
   Thirteen apprentice boys slammed the gates of Londonderry on the
army of King James II at the start of the siege in 1689.
   Extra security was planned Sunday when thousands of Catholics
were to take to the streets in Belfast's Falls Road to mark the
internment and troops anniversaries. That march was expected to be
one of the largest in the area in years.
   On Monday night, Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, is to lead 5,000 supporters through the
city.

   Fire swept through a wood-frame house
early today, killing a family of five as neighbors frantically
pounded on doors and honked car horns to alert them, authorities
said.
   The victims were Bill Fullerton, 51; his wife, Marylin
Fullerton, 42; and their children, Lori, 14; Justin, 10, and
Curtis, 3, according to the Lawrence County Sheriff's Department.
   The fire broke out about 1:30 a.m. in the garage and spread
quickly, leaving the single-story home in ashes with only a
concrete kitchen wall standing.
   The cause was unknown, said Bill Farr, an investigator for the
state fire marshal's office.
   Residents who live near the house in Stotts City, a southwestern
Missouri community of some 200 residents, noticed the flames and
tried to alert the family by pounding on doors and blowing car
horns.
   Beatrice Weaver, a neighbor, said her husband noticed the house
was on fire and tried to rescue the family.
   ``He jumped into his clothes, grabbed a fire extinguisher and
ran across the street,'' she said. ``But before he got across the
street the whole inside of the house lit up. He pounded on the
house and hollered but he couldn't get inside.''
   The body of one of the children was found in a hallway and
another child was found lying on the floor next to a bed,
indicating they had tried to flee, Farr said.
   Authorities said four bodies were recovered after the fire was
extinguished. The fifth body was found in the rubble shortly after
dawn, according to the Lawrence County sheriff's office.
   Fullerton, a construction crane operator, was described as a
friendly man who enjoyed gardening.
   ``He was generous as could be,'' said a friend, Gene Smith. ``He
would give away vegetables from his garden to all of the
neighbors.''

   The secrecy surrounding Columbia's
military mission persisted Friday, but no news about the five
astronauts indicated that all was well aboard NASA's oldest space
shuttle.
   NASA and military officials have said that except for a few
brief announcements, they would not discuss the classified flight
unless a problem occurs. The next announcement is expected sometime
Saturday morning, when the space agency gives an exact landing time
for the shuttle.
   Columbia, which launched from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Tuesday
morning, is to land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.,
sometime between 9 a.m. and noon EDT.
   The news blackout was imposed by the Pentagon, which wants to
keep the flight's goals a secret. But Air Force Secretary Donald
Rice has revealed that a satellite was deployed by the astronauts.
   After a ceremony Wednesday at MacDill Air Force Base, Calif.,
Rice told a small group of reporters that ``the United States now
has a satellite in orbit as the result of a very successful
launch.''
   Rice would not discuss the satellite's purpose, but it is widely
believed to be a 10-ton spy satellite designed to snap highly
detailed photographs of military targets over a large area of the
globe, including most of the Soviet Union. It would help the United
States verify Soviet compliance with arms agreements.
   Columbia is commanded by Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, a veteran
of two previous shuttle flights. The pilot is Navy Cmdr. Richard
Richards, and the mission specialists are Navy Cmdr. David Leestma,
Army Lt. Col. James Adamson and Air Force Maj. Mark Brown.
   In addition to deploying the satellite, the astronauts also are
expected to monitor research experiments and test their
capabilities as military observers in space during their mission.
   But NASA officials remained silent about the crew's activities,
releasing only the astronauts' menus. Dinner for most of the
astronauts included meatballs, rice pilaf, Italian vegetables and
pudding.

<HEAD>Cambodians Flock To `The Killing Fields'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Cambodians have thronged
to see ``The Killing Fields,'' the film that brought to Western
screens the horror of life under the Khmer Rouge, since it
premiered in Phnom Penh this month.
   Richard Walden, head of the U.S. relief agency Operation
California that arranged the screening, said Friday that a day
after the Aug. 4 premiere a crowd of up to 5,000 people jostled for
tickets at one of the capital's four movie theaters.
   ``There was literally a human sea trying to get tickets, there
was almost a riot to get in,'' Walden said in an interview in
Bangkok.
   Walden led a delegation including the film's British director
Roland Joffe and the principal character, U.S. journalist Sydney
Schanberg, to Phnom Penh for the screening. The delegation was
invited by Cambodian Premier Hun Sen.
   The film has been available in Cambodia for some time on
videotape, but only this month were audiences able to view it in
theaters.
   ``The Killing Fields'' tells the story of how Schanberg and his
Cambodian assistant, Dith Pran, were separated as the Khmer Rouge
entered Phnom Penh in 1975 to begin their murderous rule. The
radical Communist faction killed hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians between 1975 and 1978.
   Schanberg and Dith eventually were reunited, but only after Dith
made a hazardous trek to Thailand though rice fields filled with
the bones of the Khmer Rouge's victims.
   Walden said the Cambodian audience appeared thrilled to see
Cambodian actor Haing Ngor, who won an Academy Award for best
supporting actor for his portrayal of Dith, alongside Western stars.
   But many broke down in tears whan asked about their experiences
later, he said. The reaction of many in the audience was ```that is
all true, that is what it was like for my family,''' he said.
   Many said life under the Khmer Rouge was even worse than that
portrayed in the movie, Walden said.
   ``There was an incredible response especially in scenes which
showed the Khmer Rouge, which showed people marching out of Phnom
Penh or working in the rural areas,'' Walden said.
   He said the present government plans to continue showing the
film, hopefully outside the capital as well.
   On April 17, 1975 when the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh, they
ordered the population of 2 million out of the city to work under
slavish conditions in the countryside.
   The capital was a ghost town for 3{ years while the Khmer Rouge
attempted to build a radical agrarian utopia.
   Although ousted by a Vietnamese invasion in 1978, the Khmer
Rouge still survives with its leadership structure intact. Backed
by China, it is currently the largest of three guerrilla groups
fighting the Cambodian government from bases on the Thai border.
   In recent peace talks Hun Sen's government has insisted that the
Khmer Rouge should not be allowed a role in the future of Cambodia.

   Vietnam War veterans plan to spend more than a
month in a bamboo cage to draw public attention to U.S. soldiers
still reported missing in action in southeast Asia.
   The group began its 37-day vigil adjacent to the city's
lakefront War Memorial Center on Thursday. The vigil is to end
Sept. 15, designated National POW-MIA Day.
   Forty-eight members of Wisconsin Vietnam Veterans Chapter One
are to take turns around the clock in the cage for 37 days, said
Gary Wetzel, a Congressional Medal of Honor recipient who spoke
Friday from inside the cage covered with barbed wire.
   The cage, 5 feet long, 5 feet wide and 3{ feet tall, is about
the size of the cages in which several prisoners of war were held
during the Vietnam War, Wetzel said.
   Participants are allowed to leave the cage to go the bathroom,
and all have agreed to try to reduce their food-intake as a
symbolic sacrifice.
   Organizers said the length of the vigil was selected to honor
the 37 Wisconsin soldiers still listed as missing in action during
the Vietnam War.
   The cage is set up alongside a reflecting pool at the center,
where the names of Milwaukee's war dead are listed. Those who visit
the location are urged to write their congressmen, senators and the
president to account for Americans missing in the war, Wetzel, 41,
said.
   ``When the day comes that one American is not worth the time and
the effort to be found, we, as Americans, have lost,'' Wetzel said,
adding that more than 2,300 Americans still have not been accounted
for in southeast Asia.

   A new Soviet spy satellite exploded
on July 28 when it went out of control in space, an industry
magazine reported Friday.
   Aviation Week and Space Technology said U.S. intelligence
officials believe Soviet controllers deliberately sent a signal to
blow apart the satellite when something went wrong as they were
trying to command it to a higher orbit.
   The magazine said the satellite, which it identified as Cosmos
2,030, was launched July 12 and said it as an ``advanced
reconnaissance satellite.''
   It also reported that on July 18 the Soviets launched Cosmos
2,031, also a reconnaissance satellite but with different
characteristics than the destroyed spacecraft.

going to try faster, more uptempo songs in an attempt to bolster
his music's sagging chart success.
   Morris, who has scored big on Broadway in ``Les Miserables'' and

latest single, ``Never Had a Love Song,'' made it into the 40s on
the national charts, then died.
   ``That hasn't happened since my first single,'' he told the Fort

radio programmers that the reason why is because they're tired of
ballads by me and want something more upbeat.''
   Morris, from North Richland Hills, also said he is considering a

   Morris also taped an NBC television special that will air early

   Vanessa Williams says the nude photos that ended
her reign as the first black Miss America were both an unfortunate
mistake and an impetus for change.
   ``I don't know how I got through it, but you have to get on with
your life,'' Williams, 26, says in the September issue of Ladies'
Home Journal. ``It's what you do with a tragedy that makes life
worth living.''
   What she did was hire publicist-manager Ramon Hervey in 1984
after the old photos suddenly surfaced in a magazine and she was
forced to give up her crown. Williams and Hervey were married in
1987 and have two children: 2-year-old Melanie and 1-year-old
Jillian.
   Williams also landed small roles on TV and Off-Broadway _
refusing to even consider roles requiring nudity. Her first record
album, ``The Right Stuff,'' went gold last March and spawned four
hit singles. She received two Grammy nominations and co-starred in
a TV movie earlier this year.
   ``I always knew that one of these days I'd get a chance to show
them. The best revenge is to be a success, to have a normal life
and to have not committed suicide,'' she said, adding that she
never considered the latter.
   ``I feel really comfortable. Now that I finally have a career
and a family, there is a catharsis,'' she said. ``But I don't feel
that this is as far as I'm going to get, because this is just the
beginning.''

<HEAD>Army Doubles Time Arabs Can be Held Without Charge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The army Friday renewed efforts to quell the
anti-Israeli uprising by doubling to one year the amount of time
Arabs may be jailed without being tried or charged.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered the extension, and
Justice Minister Dan Meridor approved it.
   ``We are in a war, and sometimes residents' or citizens' rights
are harmed in the course of a war. We have to find the right
balance so that the damage would not be too serious, but on the
other hand we have to allow the army to fight and win that war,''
Meridor told Israel radio.
   The use of administrative detention, under which people can be
jailed without being charged or tried, has been denounced by the
United States and human rights organizations.
   Israel uses the adminstrative detentions under British emergency
laws of 1945, which allowed people to be jailed six months without
charge or trial. The procedure has been used frequently during the
Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
   Israel defends detention without trial as an effective means of
arresting ringleaders without revealing sources of information. But
attorneys complain they cannot respond to unspecified, secret
charges.
   A State Department report on human rights, released in February,
criticized the procedure and said in many cases that Palestinians
were detained for political reasons or non-violent activities.
   Army figures released Friday said 9,136 Palestinians are in
Israeli jails for offenses related to the uprising and that 2,111
of them are being held under administrative detention. An army
spokesman said he did not know if the new order could be applied to
those already in custody.
   Also Friday, activists of the Islamic Resistance Movement known
as Hamas beat to death a West Bank resident suspected of violating
Islamic law by dealing drugs and drinking alcohol, Arab reports
said.
   Doctors said the victim, Samir Nazieh Kamal, 32, died of
internal bleeding and had been burned on his hands and feet.
   He was the 92nd Palestinian killed by fellow Arabs since the
uprising began December 1987.
   Most have been accused of collaborating with Israeli
authorities, but ``shock committees'' that do the killings also
have targeted people for drug dealing, immoral behavior or criminal
activities.
   Since the uprising began, 535 Palestinians have been killed by
troops or Jewish settlers. Thirty-eight Israelis have died.

   A Michigan man convicted of spying for the
CIA confessed to atone for harm he did Egypt, not because he was
tricked or frightened, the judge in the case said.
   The security court that convicted Samy Wassef ``found no
evidence of physical or moral factors as claimed'' involved with
the confession, Sayeed Mahmoud Sayed wrote in explaining his
court's July 20 decision. The document was released Thursday.
   Wassef, 26, has said interrogators used photographs purporting
to show torture scenes to persuade him to sign the confession. He
told his mother, who is pressing U.S. and Egyptian authorities for
her son's freedom, that he was told his bags were packed and an air
ticket home awaited him if he signed it.
   Because no witnesses were presented at the 90-minute trial,
Wassef's 253-page confession was the main evidence on which he, his
30-year-old brother, Samir, and another American, Nicholas Edward
Reynolds, were convicted.
   Both Wassef brothers, whose family lives in Detroit, were
sentenced to 10-year prison terms and fined the equivalent of
$3,850. Reynolds was sentenced to five years and a fine of about
$1,925.
   Only Samy Wassef is in prison. The other two had left the
country before he was arrested.
   Prosecutors claimed Reynolds was the Central Intelligence Agency
paymaster for the Wassefs. They said the brothers were trained in
spy techniques and sold Reynolds information he could not have
obtained from newspapers.
   ``The court is satisfied with the evidence of guilt and with the
accuracy of (the) confession,'' Judge Sayed wrote on behalf of his
three-man tribunal. ``The verdict was comfortable and convincing.''
   His document explaining the verdict said the court was convinced
Samy Wassef signed the confession solely ``because he wanted to
repent, wanted to atone, resented what he had committed in regard
to Egypt.''
   Mrs. Wassef's efforts got another setback after Sayed issued his
explanatory statement. She said her son's lawyer, Hassan Ibrashy,
whose name she obtained from a list of lawyers supplied by the U.S.
Embassy, withdrew from the case without explanation.
   Repeated telephone calls to Ibrashy's home were unanswered.
   Security agents arrested Wassef on Nov. 14, and he signed the
confession a few days before his first visit by a U.S. consular
officer Dec. 8. He was held eight months before charges were filed
in early July.
   The explanatory document Sayed released Thursday is the final
step before the case can be appealed to the Court of Cassations,
Egypt's highest tribunal. The only recourse from that court's
review is the president, Hosni Mubarak.
   Mrs. Wassef said she will would find a new lawyer and appeal
before the Aug. 29 deadline.

   At least 16,000 workers defied authorities in
Estonia on Friday and stayed off the job for a third straight day
to protest a new election law they consider discriminatory, news
reports said.
   The Tass news agency said 26 businesses in the republic's
capital of Tallinn were affected in the walkout by the non-Estonian
workers. Strikes also were reported in the mining town of
Kohtla-Yarve.
   Tass said walkouts among railway workers were ``the most
dangerous'' because they were impeding the flow of coal shipments
that pass through Tallinn's port. It said 26,000 people were
striking in Tallinn.
   The strike began after the Estonian Parliament on Tuesday
tightened residency requirements for voting and holding elected
office in the Baltic republic.
   Under the new law, residents of Estonia must live in the same
district for at least two years, or have lived anywhere in the
republic for a total of five years, to be able to vote.
   Candidates for elective office must live in the same place for
five years, or in Estonia for 10 years.
   Non-Estonian residents of the republic, including leaders of the
Russian-dominated InterMovement group, complain the law is aimed
against them because many are new arrivals. They launched a protest
strike the day after it was passed.
   The Estonian leadership, in a statement published Friday,
``acknowledged that it failed to `take into account fully the
growth of national consciousness among the non-Estonian population
of the republic,''' Tass reported.
   Estonian government and party leaders blamed themselves for
``arousing mistrust'' among the population, it said. They also
accused strike leaders of trying to stir up ethnic unrest and
intimidate the non-Estonian population, Tass said.
   The Estonian Parliament issued a ban on strikes Thursday, but
strike leaders said they considered the move illegal and had no
plans to halt the walkouts.
   The Parliament did not say how strikers would be punished,
mentioning only vague ``administrative and criminal measures'' and
the drafting of a tougher law on strikes.
   Alexander Yakushev, a strike committee member, said in a
telephone interview from Tallinn that local officials were meeting
with strikers but that the talks could not be considered
negotiations.
   Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the
population and had pushed for the election law to protect
themselves from an influx of Russians and members of other Soviet
ethnic groups.

<HEAD>Administration Gives Lucas New Job, Defusing Fight With Democrats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William C. Lucas, rejected by a Senate panel
as the government's civil rights chief, was given a different
Justice Department job Friday that doesn't require confirmation by
lawmakers.
   Lucas' appointment, to head the department's Office of Liaison
Services, enables President Bush to end a bitter confrontation with
Senate Democrats over the nomination.
   Some Republican senators, charging that the Detroit Republican
was a victim of politics, had urged Bush to continue the fight by
giving Lucas an interim appointment to the job he had been rejected
for, assistant attorney general for civil rights.
   Such a ``recess appointment,'' while Congress is out of town
this month, would have allowed Lucas to serve without Senate
confirmation through 1990. But it also would have incurred the
political wrath of Democrats in Congress.
   Before Congress adjourned last week, Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, warned Bush that giving Lucas a recess
appointment would be ``a very unwise course of action.''
   White House officials, expressing great disappointment in Lucas'
rejection by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a pair of 7-7 votes,
had suggested such an appointment was a possibility.
   However, one White House official said Friday, ``A recess
appointment was never seriously considered. It was just kept out
there as an option to talk about. It would not have given Lucas
much in the way of job security'' while needlessly poisoning
relations with Congress, he said.
   The official, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said
Bush was not expected to nominate a new candidate for the civil
rights post until after Labor Day.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh had felt strongly about keeping
Lucas at the Justice Department, the official said.
   Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and civil
rights lobbyists who opposed Lucas contended that the 61-year-old
former FBI agent, sheriff and chief executive of Wayne County,
Mich., was unqualified to run the Justice Department's civil rights
division.
   Lucas, who has never tried a court case, conceded that ``I am
new to the law'' while being questioned at his confirmation hearing.
   In his new job Lucas will work directly with civil rights groups
that opposed his nomination as assistant attorney general.
   The nine-member Office of Liaison Services deals with state and
local governments, private organizations, businesses and law
enforcement groups.
   A former Democrat, who became a Republican in 1985, Lucas will
serve as gatekeeper for groups that want to meet with Thornburgh.
He will be paid the $80,700 annual salary he would have earned as
assistant attorney general.
   In a statement announcing the appointment, Thornburgh said Lucas
``will be in charge of coordinating cooperative efforts in law
enforcement, civil rights and the administration of justice.''
   ``He will act as my personal representative in dealing with
persons and organizations in those matters,'' the attorney general
said.
   The office Lucas will take over Sept. 5 was created in 1986 to
employ an old friend of then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III whose
appointment to be an assistant attorney general had been
successfully opposed by a liberal lobbying group.
   Barry H. Stern, 42, a longtime Thornburgh aide who now heads the
office, will become a special assistant to the attorney general.
   Stern, a key political operative who was Pennsylvania's
secretary of labor and industry when Thornburgh was governor, will
work on special projects, the department said.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Thornburgh has
begun interviewing candidates for the civil rights position,
``looking for someone who has experience in the civil rights area
... some knowledge and affiliation with the civil rights area.''
   Runkel said the criteria were the same that Lucas had to meet to
win Thornburgh's recommendation for the job.
   ``We felt that Bill Lucas' experience made him fully qualified
for that position and still believe that,'' Runkel said.
   Since his nomination, Lucas has been paid $284 a day as a
consultant to study ways to improve cooperation between the civil
rights division and state and local police.

<TEXT>
   A new state law regulating the use of
genetically altered plants and animals strikes a balance between
protecting the public and letting companies test new technology,
some environmentalists say.
   At a news conference Thursday in Washington, a coalition of
biotechnology companies and environmentalists praised the law as a
national model, and said it will boost North Carolina's role in
biotechnology, the search for better, hardier plants and animals.
   ``Citizens can be informed participants in the
decision-making,'' said Rebecca Goldburg of the Environmental
Defense Fund.
   But Andrew Kimbrell, a lawyer for a group that opposes field
testing of genetically engineered organisms, denounced the law,
especially the provision that prevents local authorities from
banning experiments.
   ``They're playing ecological roulette with communities,'' he
said, because the full impact of new organisms is unknown.
   Kimbrell's group, the Foundation on Economic Trends, is headed
by Jeremy Rifkin, a prominent critic of biotechnology.
   The law was enacted by the Legislature on Wednesday as part of
budget legislation. It establishes a 10-member state board that
will review applications by companies to take genetically altered
plants and animals out of the laboratory and into the field.
   The board can require public hearings before granting such
permits and can decide what information is made public. That
provision is intended to make sure any potential adverse effects of
a test are not kept secret under the pretense of being confidential
business information, said Gerry Hancock, a Durham lawyer and
former chairman of the quasi-public N.C. Biotechnology Center.

<HEAD>Thieves Make Off With Statue of Tom Mix's Horse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Tom Mix were still here he'd know how
to handle the low-down varmints who stole his favorite horse.
   A statue of Tony the Wonder Horse, the late cowboy movie star's
favorite steed, has been stolen from his place of honor at the Tom
Mix memorial near here, Pinal County authorities said Thursday.
   Sheriff's Sgt. Melvin Moore said deputies know only that the
metal statue is gone. They don't know when it was stolen, who took
it, or why.
   ``The horse was on top of the Tom Mix monument out there, and it
seemed like someone just pushed it backwards and forwards until it
broke off,'' Moore said. ``It looks like they took it with them
because we couldn't find it out there.''
   The Mix memorial was built in 1947 at a site along the
Tucson-Florence highway where the silent-screen cowboy died at the
age of 60 in a 1940 traffic accident.
   The monument, which included a bronze plaque, was topped by an
iron statue of a horse with its head lowered and its saddle empty.
   That original statue, donated by the Florence Chamber of
Commerce, was stolen in the spring of 1980. It was never found.
   The county Historical Society replaced the statue five years ago
with help from inmates at the Arizona State Prison in Florence,
society spokeswoman Billy Earley said.
   ``And now the new statue has been the private research group, the Game
Conservancy.
   ``During the season, which lasts until December, people who
usually stage 10 days of shootings will probably hold two or
three,'' he said.
   ``A large amount of shooting is being canceled,'' agreed Charles
Orssich of Roxton Sporting Agency Ltd., which organizes shoots on
the grouse moors, most of which are privately owned.
   But he said demand was still high from ``English, American,
French, German, all sorts of people from all walks of life'' who
can afford the $1,100 to $1,600 a day it costs to shoot.
   Traditionally, the Glorious Twelfth was highlighted by a race to
whisk the first game from the moors and serve it piping hot on the
table.
   ``People would try to serve it for breakfast. They'd be out on
the moors in Formula One racing cars,'' said Pamela Crawford,
spokeswoman for the prestigious Gleneagles Hotel in eastern
Scotland, a former grouse-serving contender.
   But a combination of ecological awareness and hunt protesters
who make pre-dawn attacks to drive off the birds has toned down the
presentation.
   ``We used to celebrate the Glorious Twelfth, but for the fifth
year running, we're giving the money we normally spend on the race
to the Scottish Grouse Research Project Appeal,'' said Ms.
Crawford. ``The only guns at the hotel tomorrow will be fired at
clay pigeons.''
   Still, people will be able to eat a traditional Twelfth meal at
the 65-year-old hotel. ``I'm sure grouse will be on the menu,'' she
said.

<HEAD>US Condemns Syrian Role In Beirut Fighting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Friday took the
unusual step of singling out Syria for its role in the latest
outburst of fighting in Beirut.
   The criticism came as U.S. officials continued to seek Syrian
help in obtaining the release of eight American hostages held by
pro-Iranian militants in Lebanon.
   ``The United States condemns the indiscriminate slaughter of
innocent people and the renewed use of heavy caliber weapons, such
as the 240-millimeter mortar, which are in the Syrian arsenal,''
said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``We again call upon Syria, an active participant in the
fighting, the Lebanese armed forces, as well as the various
Lebanese factions, for an immediate cease-fire, the lifting of all
blockades, and the initiation of a dialogue for the political
reconstruction of Lebanon,'' she added.
   The State Department has in the past generally refrained from
singling out the combatants by name, preferring to call for
restraint by all sides.
   The latest round of fighting in the five-month artillery war
over control of Beirut came on Friday, when Syrian and Christian
gunners dueled with howitzers and rocket launchers, killing six
people. The fighting followed 15 hours of fierce fighting Thursday
that escalated sharply when Syrian gunners targeted the
presidential palace with 240mm mortars.
   ``The escalation and the shellings and the dramatic increase in
casualties give urgent impetus to our call for the Arab League to
overcome the obstructions facing it and resume its efforts on
behalf of the people of Lebanon,'' Tutwiler said.
   Several weeks of mediation efforts by leaders of the 21-nation
Arab League have failed to bring about a lasting cease-fire.
   Tutwiler said the United States, through its embassy in
Damascus, approached the Syrian government about the hostages. The
approach came after a group of kidnappers claimed last week to have
hanged Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins and the State Department
sought to determine his fate.
   ``We have continued our contacts to try to assure that Syria
will do everything possible to assist in a successful resolution to
the hostage crisis,'' she said.
   U.S. policy toward Syria treads a delicate balance of criticism
of the Soviet-backed government for its support of Palestinian and
Shiite terrorism and seeking to enlist its support for the
Arab-Israeli peace process and other negotiations in the volatile
region.

<HEAD>Bush `Would Not Rule Out' Seizing Panama's Noriega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush ``would not rule out'' seizing
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler, to face
charges in Miami in a federal drug trafficking case, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday.
   The spokesman, however, did not say the president was
contemplating such a move, and said there was no correlation
between Bush's comments to that effect in an interview and the
recent military maneuvers by U.S. forces in Panama.
   The stepped up military maneuvers are intended to make an
impression in that volatile country and ensure that ``our degree of
interest and control there is recognized and protected,'' Fitzwater
told reporters.
   Reporters asked for clarification on the difference between
seizing Noriega, who is accused of drug trafficking by the United
States, and terrorists kidnapping Americans they believed guilty of
crimes.
   Elaborating on Bush's comments in an interview this week with
Hearst Newspapers Washington bureau, Fitzwater said:
   ``The president was pointing out ... the difference between
kidnapping and capturing someone who has been indicted, charged and
ordered to be extradited to the United States for legal violations.
And he said he would not rule out that option in the case of Mr.
Noriega.''
   Bush, asked how he viewed the Noriega situation in light of his
position that he would not abduct anyone to set up a hostage trade,
said in the interview that ``there's a differentiating precedent
between taking somebody hostage and apprehending somebody to bring
them to trial.''
   ``I took an oath to uphold the law. It doesn't include
necessarily telling me how I have to go about apprehending people,
but I wouldn't rule out an option or discuss what I might or might
not do in terms of Noriega.
   ``But I view that very differently than if you took somebody and
then wanted to trade him off,'' Bush said.
   The United States has tried unsuccessfully to pressure Noriega
from power, and currently supports the ongoing diplomatic efforts
of the Organization of American States to arrange a peaceful
transfer of power by Sept. 1.
   The OAS called for subsequent democratic elections to select a
new president, although the organization did not specifically call
for Noriega to step down, as the United States has urged.
   Bush beefed up U.S. trooppresence in Panama as part of a show of
opposition to the Noriega regime after the strongman refused to
acknowledge results of the May election that was widely said by
observers to have been won by the opposition forces.
   A weeklong series of confrontations between Noriega's Defense
Forces and U.S. Southern Command troops included arrests on both
sides and the blocking of nearby Fort Amador by American soldiers.
   U.S. troops have been conducting exercises to defend the Panama
Canal under the 1977 treaties, and Panamanian troops in some
instances have been shadowing them.
   Noriega on Thursday said he will not yield to demands that he
quit as chief of the Defense Forces from what he called ``those
barbarians from the North, their lackeys and tame politicians.''
   Fitzwater said the U.S. exercises would continue.
   ``We have always said that we would feel free to carry out
exercises in support of our rights under the Panama Canal Treaty
... And in the current situation there, frankly, the purpose of
that is just to make sure that we do have that access, to make sure
our degree of interest and control there is recognized and
protected.''

<HEAD>French Cardinal Says Accord on Auschwitz Should Be Respected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Albert Decourtray, Roman Catholic
archbishop of Lyon, said Friday the agreement with Jewish groups
calling for moving a Carmelite convent away from the site of the
Auschwitz death camp should be respected.
   ``An accord binds those who signed it,'' said Decourtray, who
was involved in negotiating the agreement between Jewish and
Catholic leaders signed in Geneva in February 1987.
   Jews have argued it is offensive to locate the convent and erect
religious symbols at the Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. An estimated
2.5 million Jews were murdered at the camp in Nazi-held Poland.
   The archbishop of Krakow, Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, said
Thursday the agreement with Jewish leaders had been suspended and
blamed recent protests by Jewish groups at the convent for creating
an ``atmosphere of aggressive demands.''
   Decourtray said in his statement Friday that ``demonstrations
and regrettable reactions cannot be taken into account against the
cause which the accord of Feb. 22, 1987, was intended to defend.''
   He said the French Roman Catholic bishops would ``do everything
we can so that the dialogue inaugurated under the sign of the
Geneva accord can continue. We need mutual respect so as not to
damage the memory of Auscwhitz.''
   A statement in Paris by members of the Jewish delegation to the
Geneva talks noted ``with satisfaction and respect the terms of the
declaration Cardinal Decourtray has just issued.''
   It said the delegation ``fully associates itself with Cardinal
Decourtray's appeal for mutual respect in the memory of Auschwitz
and of all Jewish and non-Jewish victims of Auschwitz.''

   A woman has been charged with
first-degree murder in the death of her 3-year-old son last month,
and the deaths of two other children in 1987 and 1988 will be
investigated, officials said today.
   Tammy Eveans, 23, of rural Brighton was arrested and charged
Thursday after a three-week investigation by the Illinois State
Police, the Madison County coroner's office and the Jersey County
sheriff's department, said Jersey County Sheriff Frank Yocom.
   The woman is accused of killing her son, Richard Wesley Eveans,
by placing her hand over the child's mouth and suffocating him.
   Authorities say the woman had two other children who died in the
past two years: 2-month-old Robert Wayne, who suffered a fractured
his skull on Aug. 25, 1987, after a reported fall; and 3-week-old
Amy, whose Aug. 1, 1988, death was attributed to sudden infant
death syndrome.
   Their deaths will be investigated, authorities said.
   Richard died July 19. Ms. Eveans, who was reportedly at home
alone with him, called an ambulance for the boy, who was pronounced
dead at St. Anthony's Hospital in Alton in neighboring Madison
County.
   A coroner's inquest found the cause of death to be suffocation.
   A preliminary hearing was scheduled later today. Jersey County
State's Attorney Richard Ringhausen was expected to ask that Ms.
Eveans be held without bail.

   Wildcat strikes at Volkswagen
and South African Motor Corp. ended Friday with 8,500 workers
promising to go back to work Monday if the companies returned to
the bargaining table.
   Toyota South Africa Ltd., with 3,600 employees on strike, was
the only major auto manufacturer remaining shut down. Toyota has
balked at demands by the black National Union of Metalworkers of
South Africa that it join industrywide wage negotiations and has
fired the striking workers.
   Volkswagen and South African Motor Corp. (Samcor), which
manufactures Fords and Mazdas, had been participating in the talks
but closed their plants when they were hit by wildcat strikes in
the midst of negotiations. Volkswagen dropped out of the talks
Wednesday and threatened to fire its 5,500 employees at the plant
in Uitenhage in eastern Cape province if they didn't agree by
Friday to return to work.
   Union organizer Gavin Hartford said the workers decided Friday
to return to their jobs Monday and that Volkswagen said it would
rejoin the national negotiations, which are to resume Wednesday.
   Les Kettledas, the union's collective bargaining co-ordinator in
Port Elizabeth, said the 3,000 workers on strike at the Pretoria
and Port Elizabeth plants of Samcor had agreed to return to work
Monday and the company had dropped other preconditions. Samcor had
never dropped out of the wage talks.

   A mom dressed as Batwoman has begun
patrolling her neighborhood in a crusade to keep children off the
streets late at night.
   ``It's kids who've become the problem, and it's not really their
fault,'' said Vicki Graswich, who dons black tights, black
knee-high boots and a black cape in her bid to curb vandalism.
   Many families bought homes in the Balcones Woods subdivision a
dozen years ago, when they were new and cost about $130,000 apiece,
she told the Austin American-Statesman in Friday's editions.
   Since the bottom dropped out of the economy, Ms. Graswich said,
her home is worth about $89,500.
   ``Wives have had to go back to work to help husbands, and the
kids, especially those between 11 and 15 who are too old for day
care, are left to their own devices, especially in the summer and
even after school before the parents get home. So they've become
latchkey kids,'' said the 36-year-old mother of three.
   Vandalism has increased, she said. Mailboxes have been smashed,
her house was wrapped with toilet paper and her car was covered
with lipstick graffiti.
   Ms. Graswich got together with some neighbors.
   ``I put together this Batwoman costume for myself, and one of
the dads wore a Dracula cape from his kid's Halloween party, and we
got into our individual cars and spread out over the
neighborhood,'' she said.
   The group patrolled from 10:30 p.m. until 5 a.m., urging
children under age 15 to honor a 10 p.m. curfew that she said was
set by the neighborhood association. The city also has a curfew,
but it applies only to parks.
   The children were polite, Ms. Graswich said. ``And they went
home. I saw to that.''
   But one resident called the newspaper to complain about Ms.
Graswich's tactics. ``Who does she think she is, driving around
late in outlandish garb like that, telling other people's kids to
go home?'' asked the caller.

   The first Soviet-Israeli joint economic venture
will manufacture medical diagnostic equipment in Kiev, Tass
announced.
   Relations between Israel and the Soviet Union have been growing
warmer in recent months, but full diplomatic ties have not been
restored. The Soviet Union broke off relations with Israel in 1967.
   Tass quoted Andrei Serdyuk, deputy health minister in the
Ukraine, as saying the joint venture was formed by his ministry,
the Israeli corporation Elscint and a Kiev weapons manufacturing
plant starting to make goods for the consumer sector.
   The enterprise will assemble foreign-manufactured parts into
ultrasonic equipment which is used to diagnose problems with
internal organs and check the health of fetuses, the official news
agency said. Its products will go both for export and for domestic
use.
   ``Unfortunately, there is a shortage of such equipment in the
U.S.S.R.'' Serdyuk told Tass. ``This is especially true of
high-class systems, like those produced by Elscint.''

   A apparently trying to escape a
ticket collector jumped from a speeding express train and was
seriously injured, a railroad spokesman said Friday.
   Rainer Honig, 22, of Mannheim, West Germany, was listed in
serious condition at Utrecht's university hospital following the
incident Thursday, according to spokesman Hans Binnendijk.
   Honig, who was believed to have been intoxicated at the time,
gave his passport to a fellow traveler on the Amsterdam-Cologne

moving at 78 mph, Binnendijk said.
   Honig's jump apparently was triggered by the approach of the
ticket collector, according to Binnendijk.

<HEAD>U.N. Team Visits Khmer Rouge Killing Grounds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A United Nations team on Friday
visited the mass graves of Cambodians slaughtered by the former
Khmer Rouge regime, which the world body still recognizes as part
of Cambodia's government.
   Team leader Lt. Gen. Martin O. Datset, touring a recently
erected memorial at the site, refused to sign the visitor's book,
left after 15 minutes and said it was not the proper place to speak
with reporters.
   ``I won't give any comments at all,'' he said, his face solemn
and drawn. ``I think this is a place where one should be alone.''
   The team visited the Choeung Ek grave, nine miles outside of
Phnom Penh at the invitation of the current Vietnamese-installed
government, which converted the site to a memorial that includes
8,985 skulls.
   Datset's 15-member team was on the fifth day leave the
churches and the mosques alone.''
   At Siem Reap airport, Om Sakul, a 21-year-old soldier, was asked
where the Khmer Rouge guerrillas were. Gesturing with his hand over
his head past the runway, he said, ``All over here.''
   On Saturday, team members are to visit areas along the Thai
border where recent fighting has been reported.

   The Soviet Union's first free economic zones will
come into being near the Finnish border in the northwest and near
Nakhodka in the Soviet Far East, a Soviet weekly reported Friday.
   Two other areas, the historic northern city of Novgorod and the
Black Sea resort town of Sochi, also are under consideration for
special economic status, according to the publication Arguments and
Facts.
   The zones will go ahead as experiments even though legislation
defining their status has not yet been worked out, a top economic
official said.
   Ivan D. Ivanov, deputy chairman of the state Foreign Economic
Commission, said the zones would be autonomous entities with
independent budgets. Products and services will move freely between
the zones and the foreign market without customs or other
non-tariff restrictions, including licensing, he said.
   He did not specify when the new economic status would come into
effect, but said ``the decision has already been taken.''
   In China, special economic zones are a key part of current
experiments with Western economic ideas. Shenzen, near Hong Kong,
is packed with foreign firms' factories employing low-paid Chinese
labor to produce goods for export.
   Ivanov said that unlike free zones in other countries, the
Soviet zones will be geared toward the domestic market.
   Proposals to make the area of Armenia that was devastated by
December's earthquake a special economic zone also are being
considered.

   The red building tucked away in the scenic
mountains of northwest Virginia looks more like a schoolhouse than
the nation's first prefabricated jail made from converted shipping
containers.
   New picnic tables in the back overlook a lush green field.
There's plenty of room outside the building for exercise or
picnics. But the building is being noticed for more than its looks.
   ``I think what these people are doing for prison construction is
equivalent to what Henry Ford did for automobile construction,''
said Richard Abell, assistant U.S. attorney general for justice
programs. ``Henry Ford did not invent the automobile, but he made
it accessible. What these people are doing is making prisons
accessible.''
   Abell said the Loudoun County facility is the first of its kind
in the country. He said what makes this jail different is ``no one
has ever taken these shipping containers already made, and made
them into jails.''
   Surfside 6 Industries of McLean built the six-cell, 23-cot jail
in 13 working days for $96,398. That translates into a cost of
about $4,000 a bed.
   ``Ordinarily, it costs $40,000 to $100,000 per bed space, and it
generally takes two years to build a jail or a prison,'' Abell
said. ``These guys put it together in two weeks. That's beyond
revolutionary.''
   Abell said another advantage is the flexibility of the prefab
jails.
   ``Like Tinkertoys, they can be rearranged if they need to be
changed in five or 10 years,'' Abell said. ``If the needs have
decreased, they're not stuck with it on the landscape. You don't
have a problem like San Francisco has with Alcatraz _ a big massive
sore on the landscape.''
   Jim Wordsworth, secretary and treasurer of Surfside 6, said the
prefab building could be used as a shelter for the homeless or to
store records.
   Each steel shipping container is 8 feet tall, 8 feet wide and 20
feet long, Wordsworth said. To convert it into a jail cell, the
container is insulated and a wall covering such as cement or
drywall is put on. The finished building uses traditional plumbing,
wiring and heating.
   Wordsworth said the used containers are transported to Surfside
6 Industries' factory in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and put together
there, then shipped to the location. He said they can be built on
site too.
   Abell, a member of the National Institute of Corrections
Advisory Board, said prison crowding has become a national problem.
   ``Between 1963 and 1981, our crime rate soared 337 percent in
the United States and prison construction in the same period went
up 27 percent,'' Abell said.
   Loudoun County Sheriff John Isom said there is a shortage of
about 3,000 beds in the Washington, D.C., area, and of about 1,900
beds in northern Virginia.
   He said the maximum-security prison in Leesburg has 63 beds and
averages 100 people a day. He said he plans to move at least 23
people who are in work-release programs to the prefab jail when it
opens this month.
   But Isom said, ``Overcrowding will continue unless someone
figures out a way to eradicate the drug problem.''
   Crowding causes many problems, he said, including violence.
   ``We have inmate fights a couple of times a week,'' Isom said.
   While counties elsewhere have agonized over finding sites and
money to build large, future-oriented buildings equipped with
computer-controlled security and even robot food carts, Isom said
he was looking for a quick and inexpensive solution.
   He and Wordsworth said the jail's security will be adequate.
Wordsworth said a special welding torch would be required to cut
through the walls, made of Insulcrete, a patented concrete with
high insulation quality.
   He said officials from all over the country are calling about
the jail.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' he said. ``They're bringing the county
administrator, the director of finance, the sheriff to look at this.
   ``It's unique, it's portable, you can set it down and then move
the whole structure,'' he said. ``There is so much citizen unrest
on the location of prisons and jails ... They can assure the
citizens they're temporarily solving a problem until they go
through all of the rituals of building.''
   Greg Bogdan, spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said
the bureau isn't opposed to the prefab idea, but says it isn't the
long-term solution to the crowding problem.
   ``They're suitable for emergency situations, but they're not an
answer to the long-term prison problem as far as the bureau is
concerned,'' Bogdan said. ``There is still a need for permanent
facilities.''

<HEAD>Task Force Still Undecided on Oil Exploration Safeguards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential task force indicated Friday
that improved environmental safeguards are essential if oil
exploration is to be allowed in three controversial ocean sites off
the California and Florida coasts.
   But the task force gave no indication in a progress report on
what it will recommend to the president at the end of the year, and
said it also has made no judgment ``on the validity of conflicting
claims about environmental and economic effects'' of drilling in
the three areas.
   The panel, which is charged with recommending to President Bush
whether to open up the three sites for oil drilling, outlined a
broad array of options it is considering from urging a go-ahead for
drilling to barring oil companies from the areas altogether.
   The task force document acknowleged that during nine public
hearings, a ``vast majority'' of the testimony revolved around
concerns that oil drilling on the sites would cause harm to
environmentally sensitive areas nearby.
   ``Many people expressed the view that while they would suffer
the losses from any environmental effects of oil and gas
development, they stand to gain few, if any, of the potential
benefits,'' said the task force. At the same time, the group noted,
oil and gas industry spokesmen disputed the environmental concerns
and suggested the risks are minimal.
   Environmentalists have long opposed oil drilling in the three
areas _ a 1.1 million acres section of ocean off Southern
California, another 6.7 million acres off the Northern California,
and 14 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico near the Florida
Everglades.
   In each case, critics have questioned the need to open the areas
for oil development and maintained that drilling threatens nearby
national parks, various endangered species and delicate sealife.
The concern intensified after the massive oil spill from the Exxon
Valdez tanker last March in Alaska.
   The task force said it had heard from more than 650 witnesses
during the nine hearings and received some 11,000 pieces of written
testimony, but said it was opening the matter for additional
written comments from interested parties before proceeding.
   While the task force said it was not prepared to agree or
disagree with the claim of environmentalists, it said that before a
decision is made on whether the three areas should be opened to the
oil companies, ``additional restrictions designed to reduce the
environmental impacts of oil and gas development'' will be needed.
   It noted a long list of options aimed at improving environmental
safeguards, but said no decision had been made on which ones to
recommend to the president.
   Among the options under consideration are the widespread use of
buffer zones between drilling sites and areas that are
environmentally sensitive and an array of proposals to protect
against oil spills or mitigate damages if a spill should occur.
   The panel said it is considering suggestions that oil from
offshore drilling sites in the three areas to be transported to
shore by pipeline and not tanker; that oil companies as part of
their lease agreement hold a special bond to assure adequate
compensation for spill damage; that permanent emergency response
teams be established with adequate equipment, manpower and training
and that tankers, if allowed, be limited in size and have double
bottoms.

<HEAD>Cornfield Becomes Artists' Canvas: Art With Good Taste</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sculptor and a poet who spent their
boyhoods working the family farm have planted a field of corn in
the middle of the city and scattered furniture within the rows _
all in the name of art.
   In two weeks, they'll have a poetry reading, a harvest and then
roast an ear of art.
   Now that's art with good taste, or at least art that tastes good.
   Sculptor Caleb Brennan and part-time poet Dale Hasenick hope to
raise _ along with an edible crop _ awareness about the importance
of corn in American life.
   ``I'm hoping that people might have an awareness of how corn is
in our lives all over _ everything from corn oil to plastics,''
said Hasenick, whose poetry inspired Brennan's sculpture in the
front yard of the Urban Institute for Contemporary Arts.
   Inside the 30-by-30-foot patch of maize are a stove, kitchen
table, stuffed chair and toilet, all culled from the Salvation Army
and a dump. An old-fashioned bedstead surrounds a coverlet of
marble chips, upon which sleeps a little white pine tree. Elf-size
chairs and a sewing machine were added by an artist in residence at
the institute.
   The pair reason that if corn starch compounds can be used to
make such items as biodegradable garbage bags and disposable
diapers, surely its stalks can be used for art.
   Some neighbors aren't pleased with the urban field of dreams and
question how anyone could consider it artwork.
   But Mary Barwacz, who grows corn in her garden down the block
from the institute, gets a kick out of the piece.
   ``It's comical,'' see said with a chuckle. ``Darn nice corn,
too.''
   Brennan and Hasenick both worked on family farms near Jackson in
their youth and met at Spring Arbor College.
   Brennan, who sets up exhibits at the Grand Rapids Art Museum,
got the idea for the ``Maize House'' when he read part of a poem in
progress by Hasenick in which a man makes himself a house amid a
cornfield.
   ``The character sets up his living space and a religious shrine
in the middle of a cornfield,'' said Hasenick, who works as a
magazine typesetter in Chicago.
   He sees three levels of interpretation of the exhibit: corn as a
commercial product, corn as an object of sustenance and spiritual
reverence for North and Latin American natives, and corn as a
cornerstone of Midwestern traditions and culture.
   But in the last analysis, Brennan and Hasenick hope the public
will appreciate the sculpture at face value. People are invited to
walk through the stalks.
   ``I think it should be enjoyed as kind of a fun idea,'' Brennan
said. ``Just come at it with what you know about corn and houses.''

   ``Scorecard killer'' Randy Kraft should
die in the gas chamber for his two-decade spree of sexual violence
and mutilation that left at least 16 young men and boys dead, a
jury decided Friday.
   The jury had convicted Kraft of 16 murders on May 12. They began
deliberations Wednesday on the penalty.
   Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald McCartin will sentence
Kraft on Oct 27. He can reduce the punishment to life imprisonment.
A death sentence will automatically be appealed.
   ``This is our day for justice. It will not bring back our son.
But at least we know he (Kraft) will not be back out on the
streets,'' said Shirley DeVaul, the mother of one of Kraft's
victims, Rodger James DeVaul, 20.
   DeVaul's body was found sodomized with his throat cut, dumped
near the a ski resort on Feb. 13, 1983.
   As the jury filed into court, Kraft leaned back almost casually
in his chair. Then he leaned forward, peering intently as each
juror was polled and each confirmed the death sentence.
   The verdict followed months of grisly testimony about the
deaths, which took place from 1972 to 1983. Kraft, a 44-year-old
computer consultant, picked up hitchhikers, disabled them by plying
them with drugs and alcohol, sexually tortured and mutilated them,
and then strangled them, prosecutors said.
   ``It gives me the shivers to talk about it,'' Deputy District
Attorney Bryan Brown said at one point.
   Defense attorneys C. Thomas McDonald and James Merwin never
called Kraft to the witness stand. They argued that evidence
against him was inconclusive.
   The 16 murder convictions are an Orange County record and one of
the nation's biggest killing sprees, but prosecutors contend they
are fewer than half of Kraft's bloody legacy. He has been linked to
at least 21 other slayings in California, Oregon and Michigan.
   ``Kraft had a fetish for collecting mementos of victims and
photographs,'' Brown said during the trial, describing photos in
which victims apparently were posed while dead.
   A so-called ``death list'' in Kraft's car, which prosecutors say
contains coded references to his victims, led Kraft to be dubbed
the ``scorecard killer.''
   Kraft was arrested May 14, 1983, when Highway Patrol officers
pulled him over for erratic driving and discovered a strangled
Marine from El Toro in the car.

<HEAD>Bankers Strike; Miners and Construction Workers Threaten Walkouts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of Peru's 30,000 bank employees walked
off the job Friday to demand higher wages, and miners and
construction workers threatened strikes to demand pay increases to
help them survive the nation's worst economic crisis.
   Inflation in the last 12 months has topped 5,000 percent, and
the economy shrank last year by nearly 9 percent. Hundreds of
thousands of people are out of work.
   The bank strike forced the nation's stock market to close
Friday. Police escorted customers through picket lines, and
mid-level managers handled some transactions.
   Radio reports said police used tear gas to break up a
demonstration outside the Banco Internacional in downtown Lima.
There were no reports of injuries.
   The Communist-led Federation of Bank Employees, whose members
make from $250 to $310 a month, are asking for increases of about
$400 a month. The banks have offered $90.
   The country's minimum wage is $45 a month.
   The National Mine Workers Federation has called a general strike
Monday to demand salary increases and joint negotiations with mine
owners. Miners struck for three months last year over the same
issue, resulting in $400 million in lost export earnings for the
country.
   The country's 80,000 miners make from $2 to $12 a day, depending
on the company. They are seeking at least $500 a month.
   The Civil Construction Workers Union said it would strike Aug.
16 to protest the ``grave crisis of hunger and misery experienced
by the workers and the public,'' according to the secretary general
of the union, Pedro Huilca.
   Friday also marked the 73rd day of a wage strike by public
doctors, which has left government hospitals and emergency clinics
unattended. The 8,000 doctors average about $100 a month and are
seeking to be paid about $290 a month. The government has offered
$250.
   All the strikes have been declared illegal by the government.
   Peru is suffering its most serious economic crisis in its
168-year history as an independent nation.
   Many accuse President Alan Garcia of bankrupting the country and
sparking hyperinflation with his free-spending, populist economic
policies.
   The government blames much of the crisis on the battle with two
rebel groups, the Mao-inspired Shining Path, which took up arms in
1980, and the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, which
has been fighting since 1984.
   The groups have attacked power lines across the country.
Electric power has been rationed in Lima and other cities as a
result of the attacks, which the government says has caused more
than $10 billion in damage.
   The government declared the mining province of Huarochiri, 30
miles east of Lima, under emergency restrictions Thursday. The move
gave the military control of the important Central Highway, which
connects most of the country's highland mining centers with the
capital.
   Jorge Quesada, general secretary of the miners union, said the
move would not affect plans for the strike Monday.
   Mining exports brought in more than $1.2 billion in 1988,
representing more than half the foreign exchange earnings of this
debtor nation.

   Vietnamese refugees at a detention center
fought a battle Friday with homemade weapons and 17 people,

   They said they had not determined the cause of the fighting but
it involved about 150 people from the Haiphong and Quang Ning areas
of northern Vietnam.
   Police said the rival groups fought for more than an hour with
iron bars and stones before police restored order at the refugee
camp that houses about 9,000 Vietnamese boat people.
   They said five of the injured people were hospitalized.
   A similar brawl occurred 10 days ago at the Shamshuipo detention
center when about 200 Vietnamese hurled stones at each other and
eight people were injured. The Shamshuipo center holds more than
4,000 Vietnamese.
   More than 50,000 Vitenamese boat people are languishing in Hong
Kong camps and most will have to prove they fled political
persecution to qualify for resettlement in this British colony.
   The government, struggling with the mounting problem, has
declared it will send back to Vietnam boat people who do not
qualify as political refugees.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 23 people were reported
killed on this ethnically divided island Friday, and the foreign
minister said Sinhalese extremists were plotting to overthrow the
government.
   Ranjan Wijeratne, the foreign minister, said the radicals had
sent death threats to many lawmakers.
   ``It is very clear there is a well-conceived plot to destroy
those who are committed to the democratic form of government,'' he
said in parliamentary debate. ``Today, the people hesitate to talk
about this situation because of fear. They have been terrorized.''
   Military officials said at least 23 people were killed in the
previous 24 hours. The officials, who cannot be named under
standing regulations, said 71 Sinhalese were arrested during the
period.
   Among the dead were 16 civilians, two policemen, three Sinhalese
radicals and two members of the Tamil ethnic minority. The
officials said the Tamils were killed by Sinhalese, the predominant
ethnic group in Sri Lanka, but that details of the other killings
were not available.
   Wijeratne said 972 government officials and supporters of the
governing United National Party had been killed in the two years of
an anti-government campaign by the People's Liberation Front, a
radical Sinhalese group.
   He also accused the extremists of killing 184 opposition
politicians and 354 soldiers and policemen.
   ``All of you are aware that ruling party members of Parliament
have received death warrants from unseen hands,'' Wijeratne said.
``You are aware that some of our parliamentary colleagues have
already been disposed of.''
   Police say many lawmakers and senior government officials have
received death threats.
   About 2,500 other people, including members and suspected
members of the Sinhalese front and police informers, have been
killed in the confrontation between the extremists and the
Sinhalese-dominated government.
   Sinhalese radicals began their campaign in July 1987, claiming
the government made too many concessions in a peace accord aimed at
ending a seccesionist Tamil war in which at least 11,000 people
have died since 1983.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
claim discrimination by the Sinhalese.

   A suspect confessed to premeditation in
the drownings of four children killed when their family's car
crashed through a barrier and into the Detroit River, police said
Friday.
   Police said they had sought a murde warrant against the suspect,
whose name they refused to release pending arraignment later in the
day.
   Relatives said Lawrence DeLisle, the father of the children, was
taken into custody Thursday after he and his wife submitted to
polygraph tests.
   ``The premeditation goes back some time, and the opportunity
presented itself,'' Police Chief Edward Rothermal said at a news
conference Friday.
   Though they would not identify the suspect, police did say they
were not seeking charges against DeLisle's wife, Suzanne, who also
survived the Lincoln Park family's crash Aug 3.
   ``The facts of the investigation reveal she had nothing to do
with this,'' Rothermal said.
   He said the suspect disclosed a motive during questioning
Thursday. But the police chief declined to elaborate, or say
whether Mrs. DeLisle was an intended victim or whether the accident
was a suicide attempt.
   ``Yesterday afternoon, things started working out for us,''
Rothermal said. ``The investigating officer received a statement
indicating the involvement (of a suspect) and what actually
happened at the river.''
   DeLisle, 28, was driving when his car ran into the river in this
Detroit suburb. He and Mrs. DeLisle, 32, escaped when boaters
passed life preservers to them, but their children, Brian, 8;
Melissa, 4; Kadie, 2; and Emily, 8 months, were killed.
   DeLisle said a leg cramp caused him to floor the accelerator.
   William DeLisle, Lawrence DeLisle's uncle, said Mrs. DeLisle
called him Thursday night to say her husband was in jail.
   ``She didn't say why,'' William DeLisle said. ``This is worse
than what happened five days ago. I don't know what it is. I'm
going to find out as quick as I can.''
   Asked if DeLisle's detention made him doubt his nephew's story,
William DeLisle said: ``Certainly I have doubts. The boy's in
jail.''
   Mrs. DeLisle, who also took a lie detector test, said she tried
to stop the car by turning off the ignition and shifting gears
before the car struck the barrier.
   Rick Stoneburner, a witness to the accident who threw life
preservers to the couple from a boat, said the father appeared
exhausted and Mrs. DeLisle was hysterical, crying, ``I am not
leaving without my children! Save my children! They are under
water!''

<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homeowners' association that allows
basketball backboards, treehouses and swing sets has no right to
ban skateboard ramps, an appeals court ruled.
   The Hanover Woods Homeowners Association, pointing to its rules
prohibiting ``obnoxious or offensive'' activity, sued Roy Lathan
and his family last year after he built a skateboard ramp to reward
his sons, Roy Jr., now 17, and Jason, now 13, for making their
schools' honor rolls.
   Circuit Judge S. Joseph Davis Jr. told the Lathans to tear down
the 10-foot ramp, and the Lake Mary family complied. But Lathan
appealed, believing ``we were being discriminated against.''
   On Thursday, the 5th District Court of Appeal agreed.
   ``In height, the ramp does not exceed a basketball backboard,
and it is closer to the ground than a treehouse,'' Chief Judge
Winifred Sharp wrote. ``A large swing set is wider. A playhouse or
treehouse is more complex in structure.''
   Lathan said Thursday he had spent more than $10,000 on legal
costs during the past two years, and he hopes to recover those
costs from the homeowners' association.
   ``I'll get it all back,'' he said. ``If I think I'm right, I'll
go to the wall.''

<HEAD>No. 2 HUD Official To Decide Fate of Long-Troubled Housing Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The No. 2 official at the Deparment of Housing
and Urban Development said Friday he will ask Cleveland-area
officials to shake up the management of their housing authority but
opposes a federal takeover of the long-troubled agency sought by
the mayor of the city.
   ``The problem is basically a management problem and I think
clearly the management in place is not up to the challenge at
hand,'' HUD Undersecretary Al Dellibovi said of the Cuyahoga
Metropolitan Housing Authority. ``The solution to this kind of
local problem is not a federal takeover.''
   Dellibovi is traveling to Cleveland on Monday to meet with Mayor
George Voinovich, the mayor of neighboring East Cleveland and
members of the Cleveland City Council, all of whom share
appointment power to the authority board. Voinovich repeatedly has
asked the federal agency to take over the housing authority.
   Delibovi, who requested the meeting, said he wanted to reserve
judgment on the performance of the five-man board that oversees the
authority but said ``clearly the major problem is the day-to-day
management.''
   ``We are not really equipped to operate that kind of agency and
deliver public housing services but we can take supervisory action
to bring the services to to level that tenants deserve.''
   He declined to discuss steps HUD was contemplating if it did not
receive a satisfactory response from local officials.
   HUD pays more than half of the agency's operating budget. In
September 1985 HUD labeled the Cleveland authority ``operationaly
troubled'' because of its high vacancy rates and poor condition of
its units, which house more than 19,000 people on 38 sites.
   A 1987 audit found the authority on occassion paid maintenance
workers double or triple their salaries in overtime without
required proof that the work was performed. In both 1982 and 1986
HUD's inspector general issued audits critical of the authority's
maintenance program.
   An earlier internal HUD review determined that errors by the
housing agency's staff resulted in inflated rent subsidies to
developers participating in an housing rehabilitation program.
   George M. James, the authority's executive director, did not
immediately return telephone calls seeking comment.

   Two West German companies have been denied
U.S. export privileges for nine years because of their relationship
to a West German convicted of re-exporting a mustard gas ingredient
to Iran, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
   The companies, Chemco and Colimex of Cologne, were added to a
previous order denying similar privileges to West German
businessman Peter Walascheck of Colgne because of their
``affiliation, ownership, control or portion of responsibility'' to
Walascheck, the department said.
   Walascheck pleaded guilty Aug. 26, 1988, in U.S. District Court
in Baltimore to illegally re-exporting thiodiglycol from Singapore
to Iran, the department said. Thiodiglycol is an ingredient of
mustard gas used in chemical warfare.
   In addition to barring exports by the West Germans, the order
prohibits other firms from dealing with them in any export
transaction involving U.S.-origin goods without prior Commerce
Department authorization.
   The department said the order was the first authorized by the
1988 trade act.

   The publisher of Nashville's morning
newspaper has asked a federal court to block an attempt by United
Press International to make him identify the source of disparaging
comments about a former UPI president.
   The comments from the source were printed in a September 1984
story in The Tennessean about the firing of William J. Small as
head of the wire service.
   Small later sued UPI seeking $10 million and alleging breach of
contract. He also claimed UPI and several of its executives libeled
him in explaining the reasons for his departure.
   Publisher John L. Seigenthaler said in court papers filed
Thursday that Tennessee's shield law allowed the newspaper to
withhold the name of the source.
   The 1984 story quoted the source as saying Small had failed ``to
perform in a manner expected of the chief operating officer. He did
not live up to expectations.''
   Small was hired as president of UPI in September 1982. His
contract ran until Dec. 31, 1989, according to court papers.
   Small claimed in his lawsuit that the defendants conspired to
force him to quit. He was fired Sept. 8 when he refused, he said.
   The subpoena ordered Seigenthaler to appear Tuesday with all
documents relating to statements attributed to the source. The
court papers filed Thursday seek to quash that subpeona. The judge
had not ruled on the request by late Friday.
   The state law cited by Seigenthaler says that reporters can not
be required by government bodies to disclose ``any information or
the source of any information procured for publication or
broadcast.''

   An appearance on NBC's ``Tonight Show''
notwithstanding, Homer Williams says he's ``cotton-pickin' tired''
of reliving his resurrection from the dead.
   ``It's been fun, exhausting fun,'' said the 63-year-old
Evansville man, who gained celebrity status by being mistakenly
declared dead, and then ``legally alive'' by a Vanderburgh Superior
Court judge. ``It's fun, but I don't want to have to die to do it
again.''
   Williams' attorneys probated his will after another man sharing
his name died in a nursing home. The retired road surveyor was
fishing with his grandson in Alabama at the time. Vanderburgh
Superior Court Judge Robert Lensing straightened out the mess in
May.
   Williams said from his Los Angeles hotel Wednesday night that
his reluctant days in the spotlight have been exhausting as well as
exciting.
   After agreeing to do the ``Tonight Show'' with host Johnny
Carson last month, Williams said he has been treated like a king.
   He was flown to Los Angeles first class, where a stretch
limousine was waiting at the airport to whisk him to one of the
city's most expensive hotels.
   ``This ain't Evansville, buddy, this is hussel-bussel-go and
expensive city,'' Williams said.
   Williams said before the show that he was afraid Carson might
ask embarrassing questions and that he would clam up.
   ``But he was wonderful, he was really just super,'' he said. The
show's host also signed a copy of Williams' death certificate
during a commercial break.

<HEAD>New Study Says Fidgety Defendants Shouldn't Testify if Prosecution
Weak</HEAD>

   A hand-wringing, tie-fiddling, nervously sweating
criminal defendant actually appears more deceitful to jurors when
the evidence against him is weak than when it is somewhat stronger,
a psychological study indicates.
   Researchers who performed the study, published in Saturday's
Journal of Applied Psychology, say it supports what every country
lawyer knows: If the evidence indicates innocence to a jury, don't
let a fidgety defendant have a chance to put a noose around his own
neck.
   ``When the evidence is strong, they (jurors) could decide it
more on the evidence,'' said David R. Shaffer, a University of
Georgia psychology professor who led the study. ``The same is true
if the case is close.''
   But, Shaffer said, anxious-looking defendants appear more
deceptive to jurors if the evidence is weak.
   ``I think the jurors are saying, `The evidence isn't all that
strong, but this guy is nervous and he looks guilty.' They
reinterpret the evidence,'' Shaffer said.
   He said the study appears to contradict research indicating that
demeanor comes into play only when the evidence is ambiguous.
   Shaffer and two colleagues from Georgia College, Sarah H. Hendry
and Dina Peacock, used 120 undergraduate students as mock jurors to
hear a case of academic fraud on an exam. An actor from the
university's drama department played the defendant, whose pseudonym
was Cliff Roberts.
   Three trials were held before three juries. In the first, the
evidence was strong: Eyewitnesses saw Roberts using a cheat sheet
on the exam, his answers were identical to another student's and a
student testified Roberts had been caught cheating off her paper in
a previous class.
   The second case was weaker, with the eyewitness accounts more
ambiguous and the allegation of past cheating implied rather than
confirmed.
   In the third case, Roberts was portrayed as an excellent student
with no need to cheat. His professor testified that Roberts had
worked hard to perform well on the exam and there was no allegation
of past cheating.
   The jurors then watched a three-minute videotape, during which
Roberts made identical points about his innocence: He had no cheat
sheet or advance knowledge of the exam and had never been accused
of academic fraud previously.
   The only difference in the testimony was the actor's portrayal
of Roberts' demeanor. Half the jurors saw a calm, confident
witness, while the others saw one who stammered, fiddled with his
tie, hesitated and generally looked anxious.
   Jurors were then asked to vote for conviction or acquittal,
taking both the evidence and the defendant's demeanor into account.
   The study found demeanor had the most effect when the evidence
favored the accused, with 85 percent of those who considered the
weakest evidence and saw the nervous witness voting for conviction.
Only 15 percent indicated guilt when the defendant was calm and the
evidence was weak.
   In the strong-evidence case, 100 percent of jurors voted for
conviction when the witness was nervous and 90 percent when he was
calm; when the evidence was balanced, 70 percent favored conviction
when the defendant was nervous and 60 percent when he was
controlled.
   A nervous defendant, therefore, stood a better chance of
acquittal when the evidence against him was balanced than when it
was weak.
   ``We think that the hesitancy and uncertainty of the apparently
deceptive defendant must have appeared especially suspicious in the
face of objectively weak evidence against him ... ,'' Shaffer wrote.
   Richard Hendrix, an Atlanta criminal defense attorney who
represented former Rep. Pat Swindall in his recent perjury trial,
said the study bears out his experience in handling fidgety
defendants.
   ``If there is a strong case against the defendant, he might be
able to convince the jury to let him walk. If it's teetering either
way and you have a guy who's articulate and you think he might
carry the day, you might put him up,'' Hendrix said.
   ``It's best not to call a defendant when in doubt. He may come
off bad even if he's innocent,'' he said.
   Hendrix did not put Swindall on the stand, and the congressman
was convicted. Hendrix has not said why Swindall did not testify.

<HEAD>Justice Says Leak Compromised Bloch Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Friday said flatly
that public disclosure of its investigation of suspected Soviet spy
Felix S. Bloch has compromised the government's ability to obtain
evidence against him.
   ``There is no doubt that the premature disclosure of that case,
the premature disclosure that there was an ongoing investigation,
did compromise the investigation,'' David Runkel, chief department
spokesman, told reporters.
   Runkel refused to specify how the leak hampered investigators,
but his comments hardened the government's assessment of the damage
done.
   The case was publicly disclosed July 21. Runkel's statement
Friday contrasted with his more cautious July 31 assessment that
``premature disclosure may have had an adverse impact on the
development of new evidence.''
   On Friday, Runkel said ``the difference in the statements
reflects a different view, based on how people in the department
see the situation today.''
   No charges have been brought against Bloch, once the No. 2 U.S.
diplomat in Vienna, who is suspected of having spied for the Soviet
Union since 1974. He has been suspended with pay.
   Runkel acknowledged that the Justice Department opposed
confirmation by the State Department on July 21 of an ABC news
report that Bloch was under investigation.
   Since then, Bloch has been followed _ in what Runkel described
as ``the circus going on out there'' _ by a horde of reporters and
FBI agents who are conducting an open surveillance while
investigators try to gather evidence to bring charges.
   The chief obstacle, according to government sources, is that
investigators cannot identify a specific secret that Bloch may have
compromised. The sources say Bloch was videotaped giving a
briefcase to a Soviet agent in Paris on May 14, but investigators
don't know what was in it.
   On Thursday, Runkel acknowledged the department did not have a
case to bring against Bloch.
   ``The department does not bring charges unless it believes it
has sufficient evidence to convince a jury beyond a reasonable
doubt that a person is guilty of violating the law,'' Runkel said.
   He refused to comment when asked if the Justice Department was
negotiating a deal with Bloch under which the 54-year-old diplomat
would receive immunity from prosecution in return for detailing
information allegedly given to the Soviets.
   Runkel also has refused to discuss whether the department has
evidence of espionage that it is unwilling to use in court because
disclosure would impair counterintelligence operations.
   Bloch, meanwhile, continued on Friday to lead print and
television photographers on daily excursions from his apartment in
the capital's posh Kalorama neighborhood.
   In the afternoon, Bloch stuck his head out a window and
announced to photographers that he was about to leave.
   Two hours later, Bloch finally left in his light-blue
Mercedes-Benz, after inviting a TV crew to join him for a ride
while he did errands.
   Bloch, followed by a 20-car caravan of reporters, photographers
and FBI agents, drove to a supermarket in suburban Bethesda, Md.
Bloch also visited a nearby book store.
   In the supermarket, a TV cameraman knocked over an elderly woman
shopper while backpeddling to get a shot of Bloch.
   The woman cut her hand when she fell to the floor and TV crews
left the store after the manager asked them to leave.

<TEXT>
   A former United Mine Workers official
convicted of helping raise money for the 1969 murders of union
dissident Joseph ``Jock'' Yablonski and his family has died of a
heart attack, authorities said Friday.
   William Prater, 70, was found dead early Friday morning in his
cell at the state prison, said prison spokesman Roy VanWhy. Prater
had been confined to a wheelchair since suffering a stroke in 1983,
he said.
   George Hudock, Luzerne County coronor, said death was caused by
a heart attack.
   Prater was convicted in 1972 of three state murder charges and
was serving three life sentences. In addition, he had pleaded
guilty to federal conspiracy charges in the case.
   Yablonski, 59; his wife, Margaret, 57; and their 25-year-old
daughter, Charlotte, were shot to death as they slept at their
Clarksville home on New Year's Eve 1969. The bodies were found six
days later.
   Weeks earlier, Yablonski, founder of a group called Miners for
Democracy, had lost a bitter electoral battle to unseat UMW
President W.A. ``Tony'' Boyle. Yablonski had described the election
results as fraudulent and said he would challenge them.
   Mindful of his union's violent history, Yablonski had predicted
his challenge could lead to his death.
   In all, eight people were convicted or pleaded guilty to a role
in the deaths.
   Boyle was convicted of ordering the assassination. He died in
1985 while serving life terms in prison. The three men identified
as the gunmen _ Paul Gilly, Claude Vealey and Aubran ``Buddy''
Martin _ also received life sentences.
   Prater, a union field representative from LaFollette, Tenn., was
accused of helping obtain $20,000 in union funds to hire the
killers.
   He served 16 years of a life sentence on a federal conspiracy
charge stemming from the murders. After he was paroled, he was
extradited to Pennsylvania and committed to the state prison at
Pittsburgh in September 1988 to serve life terms. He was moved to
the prison in Dallas, Pa., later that year.
   Prater had a petition pending before the state Board of Pardons
contending the state sentence was supposed to be concurrent with
his federal term and that he should therefore have been released in
1988.
   Pennsylvania corrections spokesman Ken Robinson said prison
records showed Prater had a wife, Maxine, in Tennessee and seven
children.

   Guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement
killed two policemen and wounded a third in two attacks in the
Andes highlands, officials reported Friday.
   They said gunmen fired at two officers as they were dining
Thursday night in a restaurant in the town of Churcampa, 185 miles
east of Lima, killing one and wounding the other. The killers took
the slain policeman's revolver before fleeing, according to
authorities.
   They said a detective was beaten to death Thursday by a gang of
Shining Path guerrillas who stopped the truck carrying the police
officer and members of his family on the road between Pucara and
Huancayo, about 140 miles east of the capital.
   The Shining Path movement began its insurgency in 1980 and the
government says more than 15,000 people have been slain in violence
related to the revolt.

   The Solidarity-dominated Senate voted
unanimously Friday to condemn 1968 Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia as a violation of the ``indispensable right'' to
self-determination.
   The resolution, passed in connection with the invasion's 21st
anniversary on Aug. 21, also expressed support for the democratic
opposition movement in Czechoslovakia, Poland's southern neighbor.
   It said the invasion, which crushed the liberal reforms of the
``Prague spring,'' violated ``the indispensable right of every
nation for self-determination and the natural striving for
democracy, freedom and respect of human rights.''
   Of Poland's participation, the resolution said: ``The entering
of the army into Czechoslovakia took place against the will of the
Polish nation. The Senate finds it right to express regret and
condolence, and at the same time condemns the aggression of 1968,
which reversed the process of democratization in Czechoslovakia.''
   ``We wish strength and success to the Czechoslovak movement for
democratic renewal in its work for the good of its homeland, its
nation's freedom and its sovereignty within a fully democratic
state,'' the resolution concluded.
   The freely elected Senate, created in Poland's recent political
reforms, was seated July 4. Ninety-nine of the 100 members were
elected on the Solidarity ticket.
   Five Solidarity representatives visited Czechoslovakia in July
for meetings with Alexander Dubcek, the former Communist Party
chief responsible for the 1968 reforms, Czechoslovak dissidents and
Roman Catholic church leaders.
   Zbigniew Bujak, a Solidarity leader from Warsaw, said on
returning that the lack of democratic change in Czechoslovakia _
compared to what is happening in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet
Union _ leaves the process of reform ``crippled, deprived of one
leg.''

   U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Spottswood
Robinson is retiring after serving 25 years in the federal
judiciary, court officials announced Friday.
   Robinson plans to retire Aug. 31, leaving another opening for
the Bush administration to fill on the appeals court in the
District of Columbia. Robinson has offered to serve as a senior
judge who continues to accept judicial assignments, according to a
statement.
   There are three vacancies on the 12-member appeals court. One
opening was created with the departure of Robert Bork, the Reagan
administration's unsuccessful nominee for the Supreme Court.
Clarence Thomas, formerly chairman of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, has been nominated to fill Bork's spot.
   The other vacancy is that of Kenneth W. Starr, who recently
became solicitor general.
   Robinson was nominated by President Kennedy and appointed in
1964 by President Johnson to U.S. District Court in Washington,
D.C. He then served nearly 23 years on the appeals court, including
five as chief judge.
   He was a noted civil rights attorney and participated in the
landmark Brown v. Board of Education case before the Supreme Court.
Robinson also has served as the dean of the Howard University Law
School and on the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.

multiparty elections next year, no allied country would interfere
militarily, as in the past when party rule seemed threatened.
Szokai is deputy chief of international party relations.
   In Poland, the Solidarity-dominated Senate unanimously passed a
resolution condemning the invasion as a violation of ``the
indispensable right of every nation for self-determination and the
natural striving for democracy, freedom and respect of human
rights.''
   The freely elected Senate was created as part of Poland's
democratic reforms. Ninety-nine of its 100 members were elected on
the opposition Solidarity trade union ticket.
   Szokai told the party daily Nepszabadsag in a front-page
article: ``It is obvious today that the decision to move the
military in Czechoslovakia in 1968 was essentially wrong.'
   Hungary's participation in the Warsaw Pact invasion has become
an issue since the country embarked on far-reaching political and
economic reforms.
   In contrast to Poland, where reforms were forced by Solidarity,
reformers within the party are behind Hungary's liberalization.
Some have expessed willingness to step aside if the party loses the
first multiparty elections since the Communists consolidated power
in 1948.
   Hungarian television interviewed Dubcek and Czechoslovak
dissident Vaclav Havel, straining relations between Hungary and the
conservative Czechoslovak party.
   Szokai said the Hungarian leadership responded to an open letter
Dubcek sent to the leaders of the Warsaw Pact countries involved in
the invasion, urging them to renounce the intervention.
   He gave no details of the response sent to Dubcek, a disgraced
figure in his homeland.
   In the newspaper interview, Szokai said: ``The task of assessing
the internal political events in Czechoslovakia at the time falls
naturally in the scope of the Czechoslovak people and their
Communist Party.''
   Hungary does not want to interfere, he said, but ``it is not
necessary to conceal our opinion, either.''
   ``Since some socialist countries have already started to explore
and reassess our common past, it would be only reasonable if the
countries involved examined their ... decision together,'' he said.
   Leaders of Solidarity who visited Czechoslovakia last month,
where they met with Dubcek and activists, said later that reformers
in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union should condemn the invasion.
   Szokai said: ``Until a common analysis is possible, the
individual states should draw the necessary conclusions on their
own.''
   He said the Hungarian party had learned ``the most important
lessons of 1968'' and rejected the Brezhnev doctrine used to
justify intervention in a Soviet-bloc country if the Communist
leadership seemed threatened.
   Last month in Romania, leaders of the seven Warsaw Pact nations
agreed on the sovereignty of each and the principle of
non-interference in internal affairs.
   Asked by the newspaper whether Soviet bloc allies would ``come
to our assistance'' if the party lost next year's elections, Szokai
said: ``Most certainly not.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shells exploded in the streets Friday and
smoke billowed from the wooded slopes southeast of Beirut as Syrian
and Christian gunners dueled with howitzers and rocket launchers.
   The shelling, which lasted more than 13 hours, killed 10 people
and wounded 40.
   Authorities said the barrage shattered a nine-hour overnight
lull that followed 15 hours of fierce fighting.
   A spokesman for the Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun,
said the Syrians started the shooting Friday by targeting Aoun's
residence at the presidential palace in suburban Baabda. No
casualties were reported at the palace.
   Aoun has lived in the bunker three stories under the palace
since the confrontation began March 8 between his Christian units
and Syrian troops.
   By police count, 586 people have been killed and 1,514 wounded.
   In Washington, the State Department singled out Syria for
criticism, a departure from its usual policy of calling for
restraint by all sides.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said: ``The United States condemns
the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent people and the renewed use
of heavy caliber weapons, such as the 240mm mortar, which are in
the Syrian arsenal.
   ``We again call upon Syria, an active participant in the
fighting, the Lebanese armed forces, as well as the various
Lebanese factions, for an immediate cease-fire.''
   The Aoun spokesman, who refused to be identified, said the
Syrian barrage also targeted Beirut's eastern suburbs of Hadath and
Baabda and the Metin region north of the city.
   Shelling escalated sharply Thursday when Syrian gunners
concentrated on the presidential palace, hammering it with 240mm
mortars.
   Stunned civilians stumbled from underground shelters during the
morning lull to check their homes and businesses.
   ``Innocent civilians left the dark shelters only to be faced by
the bitter truth. This devastating war has eaten up their
properties,'' Moslem-run Voice of the Nation radio said.
   ``Is this meaningless war going to continue until the last
Lebanese is dead?'' the announcer asked, his voice choking with
emotion.
   Shell explosions, accompanied by the whooshing sound of rockets
and the wailing of sirens, echoed across Beirut and the surrounding
mountains overnight as fires, blazing out of control, illuminated
the sky.
   Security sources said more than 10,000 shells and rockets rained
down overnight.
   One noted that the ``killing ground was expanded'' during the
duel, with Aoun's gunners targeting Syrian army positions as far as
Baalbek, 40 miles northeast of Beirut.
   A resident of Baalbek, who drove to Beirut Friday, said a dozen
shells crashed into the city and the surrounding villages overnight.
   ``Obviously there were casualties. The shells targeted Syrian
army positions,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Syrian command in Lebanon refuses to comment on its losses.
   Supply lines to Syrian forces in Moslem west Beirut and the
Druse-held mountains southeast of the city go through the Bekaa
valley. The Syrian response to Aoun's shelling of the valley was
``ferocious,'' according to a police spokesman.
   At times, he said, the Syrians operated in harmony several
Soviet-designed multi-barrelled rocket launchers against the
Christian enclave, spitting out hundreds of rockets in less than a
minute.
   ``It was carpet rocketing, with salvoes of rockets crashing into
a small area and transforming it into rubble,'' the police
spokesman said.
   The duels have forced all but about 200,000 of the city's 1.5
million people to flee.
   The violence broke out after Aoun blockaded ports run by Syria's
militia allies south of Beirut. The Syrians and allied forces
retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave.
   Syria has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate. Aoun charges Syria has betrayed that mandate
by siding with the Moslems in the country's 14-year-old civil war.

<HEAD>Nation's First Rape Crisis Center Faces Massive Cutbacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's oldest rape crisis center
faces funding cuts that would devastate its ability to serve
hundreds of victims of rape and sexual assault, directors said
Friday.
   Bay Area Women Against Rape, which was founded in 1971 and has
served as a model for rape crisis centers nationwide, may lose
one-third of its funding for direct client services if county
leaders approve cuts recommended by the probation department, said
center director Marcia Blackstock.
   The cuts are part of a county-wide budget crunch that may force
the center to lay off two of the four staff counselors who help
rape and assault victims in Alameda County, Blackstock said.
   ``It means when a call comes in we're going to have to say no,
and I don't know on a personal level how we're going to do that,''
said Diane Santellan, crisis intervention coordinator.
   Most of the center's other funds are linked to the number of
clients served, so the cutback also would trigger subsequent cuts,
directors said.
   The center served nearly 8,200 new rape and assault victims last
year, Blackstock said. Services include rape crisis counseling, a
24-hour telephone hotline staffed by volunteers, hospital and court
visits, counseling and community rape prevention programs.
   With 538 rapes reported in 1987, the city of Oakland leads the
state and is fourth in the nation in the number of reported rapes
per year, Blackstock said. In addition, nearly 700 other sexual
assaults were reported to Oakland police.
   But for every reported rape, about 10 more go unreported,
according to FBI figures, she said, adding that at least 7,000
rapes occur in Alameda County annually.
   The cuts would also force the center to eliminate its
sensitivity training programs for police, therapists and hospital
personnel, she said.
   ``We won't close our doors but we'll have to drastically cut
back the number of people we serve,'' Blackstock said, estimating
that 2,700 clients would be eliminated.
   Mary King, vice-chairwoman of the county Board of Supervisors,
said the proposed center cutback is part of a 3 percent
across-the-board county budget cut ordered by the chief
administrative officer.
   ``Everybody who has come to see me or called has had a very
legitimate and vital service that's needed in Alameda County,''
King said, listing family planning services and disabled support
services as among those facing cuts.
   ``We're just doing the best we can in a very difficult
situation,'' she said. ``It's very depressing.''
   Faced with a directive to slash $1.1 million in services, the
county probation department recommended cutting all non-mandated
programs, including the $70,405 promised to the crisis center for
fiscal year 1989-90.
   The supervisors are scheduled to consider the center's budget
next Tuesday and make a preliminary decision two days later.
   Other center funding includes a $61,000 grant from the state
Office of Criminal Justice Planning and $23,800 from the city of
Fremont to operate a second office in that city. But those funds
could dwindle if the crisis center can't serve the promised number
of clients, Blackstock said.
   Blackstock finds it difficult to think of the effects of the
proposed funding cut.
   ``We live with them day and night,'' she said. ``They're not
just numbers. We see the trauma they come to us with and we see the
difference support understanding and knowledge can make in these
people's lives.''

<DATELINE>BRITT, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midwest John, Ohio Ned, Steam Train Maury
Graham and others are spreading their bedrolls this weekend in
Britt, home of the National Hobo Convention.
   About 40 hobos from across the country hitchhiked and hopped
freights to be on hand for ceremonies, including funerals for two
``brothers'' buried in the town cemetery.
   ``It's a homecoming of sorts. We're a vanishing breed. There's
no young guys out here anymore,'' said 36-year-old John Becker of
Sterling, Ill., known as Midwest John.
   Becker's traveling partner, Ned McNamer of London, Ohio, said
life on the road is getting more dangerous. Both men wear long
sheath knives hidden underneath sleeveless jean jackets covered
with souvenir buttons.
   ``We came here from the North Town rail yards in Minneapolis.
That's a real jungle,'' said McNamer, who sports the name Ohio Ned.
``In some parts of the country you could get killed for anything _
rings, shoes _ you name it.''
   ``It's a little lonely, sure. But it all depends on what your
tastes are. If you like a 9 to 5 job, fancy slacks, that's nice,
too,'' Becker said. ``But for some of us there's always that urge
to see what's up over the hill.''
   The hobos, mostly men, wore red bandanas, caps and many carried
sturdy walking staffs. They gathered Friday at the Evergreen
Cemetery for services for the Pennsylvania Kid and Hafey the Bo.
They are the fourth and fifth hobos to be buried at the Britt
cemetery. A tombstone also sits in the cemetery for all unknown
hobos who have died.
   ``We remember all of our deceased hobos, those who in hobo
terminology, `have caught the westbound,''' said a hobo named
Frisco Jack.
   Members of the Britt American Legion fired a rifle salute and
blew taps for the Kid, whose real name was Paul Wilson. Wilson, a
World War II veteran from Franklin, Pa., died in June at age 80.
   Whiskey was sprinkled on his tombstone.
   ``I know some people may look down on it, but it was what he
requested,'' Graham told the other hobos and a crowd of about 50
who attended the hourlong service.
   ``People think hobos don't make friends. But that is the main
point of our lives. Friends are the wealth of life,'' said Graham,
a short man with a long white beard and mustache who was crowned
King of the Hobos in 1973.
   ``Pennsylvania Kid was the only man I knew who shaved with
broken glass. He'd get a piece from a broken bottle, wrap it up in
toilet paper and put it in his pocket,'' said Graham, a Toledo,
Ohio, native.
   Hafey the Bo, whose real name was Al Zale, was a hobo from Los
Angeles who got his nickname because he suffered from chronic hay
fever. He was remembered as a kind and gentle man.
   ``We're going to miss those guys,'' said the El Paso Kid.
   The National Hobo Convention first came to Britt in 1900 when
Thos. A. Way, T.A. Potter and W.E. Bradford decided to do something
to show the world that Britt was a lively little town capable of
doing anything larger cities could do. The convention became a
fixture in 1933.
   The Britt Chamber of Commerce, which runs a small hobo museum in
the lobby of the defunct Old Chief Theatre, plans to expand the
museum to honor hobos, said Marian Malek, chamber secretary. Plans
also call to move the five graves of the hobos to a reserved
section of the cemetery.
   ``Hobos are a decent lot. We are not bums,'' said Joe Baker, 59,
a hobo from North Carolina. ``I've known no other life since I was
13.''
   ``Hobos have hearts, too, and they cry and laugh like everybody
else,'' Graham said.

<HEAD>World Wheat Production Won't Meet Demands, USDA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Friday it
expects a sharp increase in world wheat production this year, but
for the third consecutive season, it won't meet demand.
   World wheat production in 1989-90 is projected to be 527 million
tons, while utilization is estimated to be about 537 million tons,
according to agriculture department data.
   ``Over the past month, deteriorating spring wheat prospects in
the Northern Hemisphere have resulted in a significant tightening
in world wheat supplies,'' the department said.
   ``Even with the prospects for smaller supplies, world wheat
utilization is expected to reach a record high, necessitating
another drawdown in world wheat stocks,'' said the department.
   As a result, there will be more imports by many countries and
trade is expected to exceed 99 million tons, agriculture officials
say.

   Former Ford Motor Co. executive John Betti,
sworn in as the Pentagon's undersecretary of defense for
acquisition, promised ``a fundamental change'' Friday in the way
the Defense Department spends its money.
   Betti has been put in charge of streamlining the agency's $150
billion-a-year purchasing bureaucracy.
   ``The new undersecretary hopes to help restore public confidence
and credibility in defense acquisition,'' said a Pentagon statement.
   ``A fundamental change is required if we are to optimize the
overall aquisition process and provide the highest quality products
and services to the men and women in the field _ on time and on
cost,'' Betti was quoted as saying in the statement.
   Under a manangement review released last month by Defense
Secretary Dick Chency, Betti will serve on an executive panel that
will oversee weapons buying by the Pentagon.
   Betti will also serve on a new ethics panel called for under the
management plan.
   Since 1962, Betti had worked for Ford in a variety of positions,
most recently as executive vice president for Ford's diversified
products operation.

   Army Secretary John O. Marsh Jr. bid farewell
_ sort of _ to his colleagues at the Pentagon on Friday after
serving the longest term of any such service secretary in the
nation's history.
   As of Friday, Marsh served 8 years, 6 months and 15 days in the
job.
   On Monday he will be succeeded by Michael Stone, the current
undersecretary of the Army.
   In a ceremony attended by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and the
Pentagon's top brass, Marsh was awarded the Medal for Distinguished
Public Service, the agency's highest civilian award.
   But Marsh is not leaving the Pentagon, despite his length of
service.
   He returns Monday as an adviser to Cheney, helping him implement
his plan for streamlining the agency's management.
   In February, Marsh broke the record for longevity set by Thomas
Jefferson's secretary of war, Henry Dearborn, who served from 1801
to 1809, according to figures provided by the Army's office of
public affairs.

<HEAD>Marijuana Said Equal to Alcohol as Truck Fatality Factor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marijuana has caught up with alcohol as a
factor in fatal traffic accidents involving truckers, a National
Transportation Safety Board member says.
   James Burnett, speaking Thursday to the Arkansas Municipal
Police Association, cited a year-long NTSB study in which truck
drivers involved in fatalities were tested for 44 drugs.
   The safety board has not released the results yet, but Burnett
said they ``will demonstrate a very high rate of drug and alcohol
(use) in accidents in which truck drivers are killed. The final
data will show that marijuana abuse as a factor has caught up with
alcohol.''
   Investigators also are finding the presence of cocaine,
amphetamines and methamphetamine, all stimulants, Burnett said.
   ``Drugs most abused by truck drivers are the ones they perceive
as those that can help them `make it through the night,' so to
speak,'' he said.
   Burnett said he's not suggesting that many truck drivers use
drugs _ only that drugs or alcohol are present in a ``very high
percentage of those accidents in which they kill themselves or
others.''
   He said fatigue is another major factor in accidents that kill
about 800 truckers each year. Studies indicate a sharp increase in
accidents after a trucker drives eight hours, or six hours pulling
two trailers, he said.
   Another study indicates that economics is a factor in driver
fatigue, Burnett said. Drivers being paid by the mile or trip ``had
an incentive to keep going to maximize their income.''
   ``This is not to say that most drivers are fatigued,'' Burnett
said, but among those killed, many worked beyond the legal limit.
   Burnett said local police need to be trained to inspect
truckers' log books and have the authority to bring charges when
infractions of drivers' rules are discovered.

   The Rev. Hector Armando Calderon said
Mass on Friday in front of blank, white wooden crosses marking 38
fresh graves _ blank because the bodies in the graves were not
identified.
   Eulogio Partida Gurrola went through photos taken of the
unidentified dead, looking for his brother.
   Rosario Castro walked onto the baseball field being used as a
helicopter pad, trying to hitch a ride to the site of the train
crash to search for her father and brother-in-law.
   While Father Calderon officiated at the burials, searchers flew
crisscross patterns, looking for more victims who might have been
swept downsteam when the train plunged into a raging river
Wednesday.
   The train, a crowded local of the national railroad, plunged 25
feet into the San Rafael River, 15 miles south of Gusave, when a
bridge it was crossing collapsed. The government news agency
reported 112 people killed.
   On Friday, the government said it would pay $3,200 to the
families of victims for each person killed.
   Only about 100 townspeople attended Friday's Roman Catholic
burial service. Relatives went from place to place seeking loved
ones.
   Partida, from Tecuala in Nayarit state, was looking for his
21-year-old brother, Jose Patricio.
   ``His aunt and her 6-year-old daughter had come to Tepic on
vacation and he was taking them home to Mexicali,'' he said.
   Ms. Castro, from Guadalajara, said she had gone to the hospital,
the makeshift morgue, the Red Cross. She said her family boarded
the train in Mazatlan for Mexicali, where they planned to cross the
border to visit a relative in the United States.
   Carlos Orozco Sosa, director of Mexican National Railways, said
600-700 passengers were on the Pacific Railways train for its
regular 700-mile run from the beach resort of Mazatlan to Mexicali,
about 100 miles east of San Diego.
   The second-class train is known as ``The Burro'' because it
stops at every station.
   A week of the heaviest rains in 50 years had flooded large areas
of southern Sinaloa state and caused a small dam three miles
upstream to burst a few hours before the train passed.
   Federal highway police said in a preliminary report the rain had
weakened the railbeds, causing the train to sway sharply, and the
narrow bridge caved in under the stress.
   Some victims were battered to death inside the cars by the fall.
Others drowned and some were swept away by rushing watern in what
normally is a dry bed.
   Carlos Guzman Leffer of the state attorney general's office said
bodies originally taken to Guamuchil were brought to Guasave for
burial.
   ``We have brought them so they can all be together,'' he said.
``They are looking for bodies. The rescue operation continues.''
   Guzman said a few people were found alive as far as 12 miles
downstream, ``holding onto the branches of trees with their train
tickets still in their shirt pockets.''
   Water still stood in some fields Friday. Others were muddy, but
drying quickly in the hot summer sun. On the riverbank, nine cars
lay beside the tracks.
   All but a few of the people with minor injures had left by
Friday. Identified bodies were being flown home by the government.

   A federal judge Friday delayed an
attempt by United Press International to make the publisher of
Nashville's morning newspaper identify the source of disparaging
comments about a former UPI president.
   Publisher John L. Seigenthaler of The Tennessean was subpoened
to give a deposition Tuesday and had filed a motion to quash the
order. U.S. District Judge John T. Nixon ordered the deposition
delayed while he considers the request.
   The comments from the source were printed in a September 1984
story in The Tennessean about the firing of William J. Small as
head of the wire service.
   Small later sued UPI seeking $10 million and alleging breach of
contract. He also claimed UPI and several of its executives libeled
him in explaining the reasons for his departure.
   Seigenthaler said in court papers filed Thursday that
Tennessee's shield law allowed the newspaper to withhold the name
of the source.
   The 1984 story quoted the source as saying Small had failed ``to
perform in a manner expected of the chief operating officer. He did
not live up to expectations.''
   Small was hired as president of UPI in September 1982. His
contract ran until Dec. 31, 1989, according to court papers.
   Small claimed in his lawsuit that the defendants conspired to
force him to quit. He was fired Sept. 8 when he refused, he said.
   The subpoena ordered Seigenthaler to appear Tuesday with all
documents relating to statements attributed to the source. The
court papers filed Thursday seek to quash that subpoena.
   The state law cited by Seigenthaler says that reporters can not
be required by government bodies to disclose ``any information or
the source of any information procured for publication or
broadcast.''

   A judge heard arguments behind closed
doors Friday in a man's request to prevent his estranged wife from
having an abortion, but made no decision.
   ``I'm going to have to study a little bit of the law,'' said
Harrison County Circuit Judge Daniel McCarthy, who granted requests
by each side to make the proceedings private, and adjourned the
hearing after more than three hours, He gave no indication of when
he would rule, saying, ``We're going to have to move quickly in
this case and we will. But we need to do more research.''
   Burton Anderson, 24, asked McCarthy to prevent his estranged
wife, Melonie, from ending her 4{-month pregnancy on the grounds
that it would cause him irreparable harm and suffering.
   On Monday, McCarthy issued a temporary order blocking the
abortion. The judge was being asked to issue a permanent injunction.
   Anderson's attorney, Mike Aloi, said McCarthy wanted both sides
to submit briefs by Monday. ``Hopefully, he'll have a decision to
us by early next week,'' Aloi said, adding that the judge has
sealed the file.
   Aloi said the judge's temporary order involved a pending divorce
and that such cases in West Virginia traditionally are heard in a
judge's chambers.
   ``This is a very private and personal matter and we want to
limit the public's involvement as much as possible,'' added Melonie
Anderson's attorney, Mary Kay Hansen. She declined comment as she
left the hearing with her client.
   Aloi said the case could break new legal ground in light of the
U.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling in a Missouri case which gave
states greater power to regulate abortions.
   The high court also refused to hear the case of a Michigan man
who wanted to block his estranged wife from having an abortion,
clearing the way for her to terminate her 11-week pregnancy.
   ``The Supreme Court made an erroneous decision to make it an
absolute right for a woman to have an abortion. An abortion
obviously impacts on the father. It also impacts on the siblings,''
said Wanda Franz, president of West Virginians for Life and a vice
president of the National Right to Life Committee.
   The Supreme Court ruling ``opens the door for us to evaluate
what rights need to be considered besides the rights of the
mother,'' Franz said. ``I think any ruling that would recognize
that the father also has a concern for his own children and a right
to care for that child would be a victory.''
   The Andersons, who have no children, have been married a year.
   Mrs. Anderson, 20, has expressed concern about her husband's
ability to financially support her and a child and has maintained
that she should be able to decide whether to continue her pregnancy.
   Anderson, a truck driver, says he should have an equal say on
whether the pregnancy should be terminated.
   Aloi said Mrs. Anderson aborted an earlier pregnancy without
telling her husband.
   ``He thought it was going to be different this time. He thought
they were going to have the baby,'' Aloi said. ``Then he found out
from a third party that she was going to have an abortion.''
   Aloi said the divorce action was filed to get the court to stop
Mrs. Anderson from ending her pregnancy.
   ``This is not a divorce action,'' Aloi said. ``My client's
information was that she had an abortion planned for Tuesday
morning. Time was of the essence. We needed to get into court as
soon as possible.''
   About a dozen women and children, most of them Anderson's
neighbors, gathered outside the courthouse Friday to support him,
carrying signs that read ``Abortion Out, Family In'' and wearing
T-shirts which read ``Kids Have A Right To Live.''

   A TWA jetliner en route to New York from
Lison with about 360 passengers aboard developed engine trouble and
returned to Lisbon's Portella Airport Friday, landing without
incident, airport officials reported.
   They said the airport's emergency services were placed on full
alert. An air traffic control officer said the pilot of the Boeing
747 made a perfect landing, and Lisbon news reports said no one was
injured..
   TWA spokesman Don Morrison said in St. Louis that the ``No. 1
engine shut down. Compressor stall was the cause. They're checking
the engine out now.'' He said the four-engine jetliner was in the
air 63 minutes.
   ``There was no emergency declared. He (the pilot) did not make
an emergency landing,'' Morrison said.
   Morrison said he had no exact figure for the number aboard.

   The government claims the former manager
of West Germany's Lufthansa Airlines office in La Paz shipped more
than 100 colonial paintings and works of art out of the country.
   It asked the West German government and the United Nations for
assistance in recovering the items.
   In a letter released Friday, Education and Culture Minister
Mariano Baptista said his ministry ``has sufficient information to
indicate that Mr. Hans J. Liedtke, former manager of Lufthansa in
Bolivia, took more than 100 paintings and works of art out of the
country, utilizing the advantages that the airline at his disposal
offered.''
   It claimed that Liedtke ``took out of the country the equivalent
number of pieces that would fill two museums of this type. He could
not ignore the clear laws on this matter, which prohibit the export
under any circumstances of Bolivia's historical past.''
   Baptista did not describe the artworks in further detail.
   Officials said Liedtke left Bolivia last year after serving in
La Paz for four years and now is manager of the Lufthansa office in
Venezuela. Calls went unanswered to the airline's office in Caracas
late Friday.

   The Energy Department said Friday a special
team of investigators could find no evidence that an uncontrolled
nuclear chain reaction ever occurred at the Rocky Flats weapons
plant near Denver.
   Plutonium, however, was found in situations that require
``immediate attention,'' the department said.
   It did not detail just what those situations were or what would
be done about them.
   Plutonium is the nuclear material recovered from weapons being
retired and reprocessed at Rocky Flats to make triggers for new
weapons. It is highly toxic.
   The question of a chain reaction at the plant arose after the
discovery of radioactive isotopes of strontium and cesium that do
not occur in nature in ground water near the plant. Some plant
employees claimed that conditions existed routinely that could lead
to a chain reaction.
   An uncontrolled chain reaction produces an explosion in a bomb
and a controlled reaction is the basis for nuclear power plants.
Without the special bomb assembly, the release of energy in an
accidental chain reaction would normally disperse the radioactive
constituents below the necessary ``critical mass'' or
``criticality'' before a large explosion could occur, but the
radioactivity produced could be fatal in a small area.
   Officials from the Environmental Protection Agency and state
agencies said the strontium and cesium radioactivity was so low
that it was almost undetectable, and might have been the result of
fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests of the 1950s and 1960s.
   The team of experts from outside the department and its
contractor, Rockwell International Corp., was appointed by
Secretary James Watkins under a June 16 agreement with the state.
It is due to report before Sept. 30. Friday's announcement was
based on a briefing for Rocky Flats managers, the office of Gov.
Roy Romer and the state Health Department, the Energy Department
said.
   ``Based on the evidence examined to date at the plant, including
measurement of radioactive cesium and strontium in the soil and
water, records of past operations, criticality procedural
infractions, plant renovations, fires and radiation exposures, the
team reported that it strongly supports a conclusion that an
accidental criticality has never occurred at Rocky Flats, despite
allegations to the contrary reported in the past,'' the team said.
   ``The team also reported that plutonium was found in situations
that require immediate attention and certain safety practices need
prompt correction.''
   The team said Rocky Flats needs to pay more attention to
preventing human error and mitigating what happens when it occurs,
to improve monitoring of process flow lines and vents, to improve
safety analysis. The final report will also call for design
improvements to process lines and plutonium storage and assessment
of the chance of accidental assembly of a critical mass because of
an earthquake or fire, the department said.
   Rocky Flats has come under much criticism recently for polluting
the environment and the FBI has begun an investigation of past
practices.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Indicts 11 in Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has indicted
multimillionaire Naji Nahas and 10 other brokers in the scandal
that caused the one-day closing of Brazil's stock exchanges, the
Justice Ministry said Friday.
   Judge Augusto Guilherme Diefenthaeler of Rio's 13th Federal
Court, in his ruling Thursday, set a trial date of Sept. 13 for
Nahas and Elmo Camoes Filho, the son of former Central Bank
president Elmo Camoes, according to ministry spokesman Vinicio
Becquer.
   An arrest order was issued July 21 for Nahas and Camoes Filho on
charges of ``inadmissible manipulation'' of the Rio and Sao Paulo
stock exchanges but both men remain at large and are considered
fugitives.
   Nahas, a 42-year-old businessmen and the largest investor in
Brazil's $30 billion stock market, was the key figure in the
scandal that brought about the closing of six brokerage firms and
the resignation of Camoes as the head of the government bank.
Camoes' brokerage company was operated by his son.
   If convicted, Nahas and Camoes Filho could face up to 11 years
in prison, Becquer told The Associated Press.
   The nine others indicted in the case were not arrested or
jailed. Becquer said three trials have been set for them. The
trials begin Sept. 26.
   The others indicted include Eduardo da Rocha Azevedo, president
of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, and former Rio Stock Exchange
president Sergio Barcellos, Becquer said.
   The stock crisis began June 9 when Nahas failed to cover checks
worth $31 million for highly speculative deals on the Rio exchange.
   On June 12, the government shut down all of Brazil's stock
exchanges to avoid panic selling and Nahas was prohibited from
leaving the country. The markets reopened the next day.
   Camoes resigned from the Central Bank several days later.
   On June 26, the federal police filed two charges against Nahas,
one accusing him of trying to illegally remit $20,000 to London in
1987 and of borrowing the equivalent of $12 million from a bank of
which he was a major shareholder in 1983.

<HEAD>Rain Along the Eastern Seaboard, Flood Watches in the West</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Showers and scattered thunderstorms, occasionally heavy in the
Northeast, ranged along much of the Atlantic Coast Friday, and the
threat of heavy rains prompted flash flood watches in parts of the
West.
   Center Moriches, N.Y., got 9.8 inches of rain between 1 p.m. and
6 p.m., and other Long Island communities also reported heavy
rainfall. Noyack recorded 6.3 inches and Shirley got 7.6 inches.
Islip, N.Y., got 2.12 inches
   ``A lot of the roadways are flooded,'' said Joe Guarino, a
National Weather Service spokesman. ``It was a mess.''
   No major weather-related emergencies were reported, but Suffolk
County police said at least one major road, Sunrise Highway, was
closed due to flooding, and fire departments got calls to pump out
residential basements.
   Hartford and Bridgeport, Conn., each got more than one inch of
rain.
   Isolated showers and thunderstorms dampened other parts of the
nation, and previous heavy rains and the potential for more heavy
rain prompted flash flood watches in some areas of the West.
   Evening flash flood watches were posted for Utah, for the
mountains and southern sections of Wyoming, and for east-central,
south central and extreme southern sections of Nevada and northwest
Arizona.
   It was an unseasonably cool morning in parts of the Southeast,
with more than 20 cities reporting record low temperatures for the
date, but by early afternoon temperatures were generally in the 80s.
   Record lows for the date included Asheville, N.C., (53 degrees);
Austin, Texas, (67); Dallas-Fort Worth (64); Hot Springs, Ark.,
(55); Lake Charles, La., (66); Texarkana, Ark., (59); and Victoria,
Texas, (65, shattering the 70-degree mark set in 1925).
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Shelter Cove, Calif., to 99 degrees at Gila Bend, Ariz.
The low for the 48 contiguous states was 39 degrees at Burney,
Calif.
   The national weather forecast for Saturday called for showers
and thunderstorms scattered across much of the nation east of the
Mississippi River, with showers and thunderstorms most numerous
from the upper Ohio Valley to western New England, and on the
Florida Peninsula and southern Georgia.
   Showers and thunderstorms will also be scattered from the
northern Rockies to the southern Plateau, the southern Rockies and
the southern High Plains, with showers and thunderstorms most
numerous in Utah and southeastern Idaho.
   Fair to partly sunny skies will prevail across the rest of the
nation.
   High temperatures will be in the 80s across much of the country;
in the lower 90s in the northern High Plains and across the central
third of Texas; above 90 degrees from southeastern New Mexico and
southwest Texas to southern and central California; in the 70s
across the upper Ohio Valley and the middle and northern Atlantic
Coast region, and along the Pacific Coast.

   Gunmen fired 25 shots and exploded a

   ``Killers of my father are conspiring to kill me also,'' said
Sheik Hasina, the leader of an eight-party opposition alliance.
   Hasina, 42, was in the library on the first floor of her home
when the gunmen, riding motorcycles, pulled up outside, police
said. The assailants opened fire and threw two hand grenades. One
grenade exploded and the other failed to go off. The gunmen fled.
   The attack came four days before the anniversary of Rahman's
1975 assassination.
   Rahman's killing _ in the same house _ was blamed on two
Bangladesh military officers who led a coup. One of them, Col.
Farooq Rahman, now heads the opposition Freedom Party.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Noriega's Defense Forces
detained four vehicles full of U.S. military police Friday but
later freed them after discussions between officers of both
countries.
   The U.S. Southern Command called the detention of the military
policemen ``unjustified'' and said in a news release that it had
deployed several armored vehicles, backed by helicopters, in the
area.
   ``The vehicles were freed after U.S. military officers discussed
the situation with officers of the Defense Forces,'' the news
release said without elaborating.
   The incident, the latest of several confrontations between
Panamanian and American troops, occurred in an area known as
Curundu near the Panama Canal.
   Panama's Maj. Carlos Saldana told reporters the incident started
when ``American troops went around in civilian clothes, with their
weapons, riding in private vehicles in violation'' of the Panama
Canal treaties.
   ``No country in the world can accept that units, claiming to be
part of an army, move in within its territory armed and in civilian
clothes. If they tried to do this in any other nation they would be
killed like common muggers, like a vulgar thief,'' Saldana added.
   Southern Command's news release said the area is shared by
forces of the two countries, but Saldana said it has been an
exclusively Panamanian military zone for several years.
   The incident occurred hours after the military accused the
United States of intimidation and treaty violations, and the
foreign minister said Panama was ``an invasion site in which only
the order to fire is lacking.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
earlier Friday that President Bush ``would not rule out'' seizing
Panama's de facto leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, to face
charges in Florida in a federal narcotics case. Fitzwater said,
however, that Bush was not contemplating such a move.
   Noriega, commander of the Defense Forces, said Thursday he would
not yield to U.S. demands that he step down. He marks six years as
commander on Saturday.
   ``Panama will not bow to the law of force that those barbarians
from the north, their (Panamanian) lackeys and tame politicians are
trying to impose,'' and will not ``grovel'' before the United
States, he told a group of retired military officers.
   The opposition presidential candidate in May 7 general
elections, Guillermo Endara, accused Noriega late Friday of
subservience to the United States and called him a dictator.
   ``We never were and never will be employees of the CIA, while he
himself was one,'' Endara said in an interview.
   Endara said he wanted to be ``president of a people free of ties
with the outside and unbound by the chains of dictators at home.
Tyranny at home is just as bad as foreign occupation.''
   International observers said Endara won the May 7 election by a
landslide, but Noriega's government annulled the election.
   Noriega on Friday labeled a plebiscite proposed by the
opposition for Aug. 20 _ on whether Noriega should stay or go _ as
tantamount to turning Panama into ``a colony that accepts
arrogance, vassalage, and indignity.''
   He spoke during a parade of thousands of Defense Forces troops
and paramilitary civilian units, who ended a 10-day exercise Friday
dubbed ``Zap The Intruder.''
   Noriega's comments were his first public reaction to the
confrontations between his forces and U.S. troops, which have
included arrests on both sides and a blockade of Fort Amador by
American soldiers.
   U.S. officials say they have the right to conduct exercises
under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties to assure canal security.
Noriega accuses the United States of seeking to abrogate the
treaties and keep the canal, which is to be turned over to Panama
at the end of 1999.
   In New York, Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter asked the U.N.
Security Council to send military observers to Panama to prevent
the U.S. Army from instigating confrontations as a pretext for
armed intervention.
   ``What the situation in Panama calls for is the presence of
military observers, which we hope would be able to go as early as
next Monday,'' he said.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun said all U.S. military
activities in Panama were conducted ``in complete accord with the
Panama Canal treaties'' and recent exercises were a ``response to
the hostile actions of the Noriega regime.''
   The United States has been trying to force Noriega out since two
federal grand juries in Florida indicted him last year on drug
trafficking and money laundering charges. Noriega denies the
charges.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a
ruling granting amnesty to 38 members of the military and two
civilians who had been indicted in the disappearence of 10 members
of the outlawed Communist Party.
   The unanimous ruling cannot be appealed.
   The court ruled that the 40, who included a former air force
commander, were covered by an amnesty law issued by the military
government.
   The opposition, which is favored in polls to win the Dec. 14
presidential election, has promised to repeal the 1978 law.
   It says it will investigate the human rights violations occurred
since military president Augusto Pinochet seized power in a bloody
1973 coup, and bring those responsible for them to trial.
   Military leaders, however, have warned that repealing the law
would have ``unpredictable consequences.''
   The amnesty law covers crimes, including human rights abuses,
that occurred from Sept. 11, 1973, when elected President Salvador
Allende was overthrown, to March 11, 1978.
   Among the defendants were retired air force Gen. Gustavo Leigh,
a former member of the four-men military junta led by Pinochet that
took power after the coup. Leigh retired in 1978.
   Also covered by the amnesty were two other air force generals
and a national police general, all retired.
   After seizing power, the military jailed thousands of members
and supporters of the toppled leftist government. Some were
tortured and killed, and thousands were forced into exile.
   The Roman Catholic Church and human rights groups here and
abroad have documented the cases of more than 700 disidents who
disappeared after being arrested by security agents.
   The group granted definite amnesty today had been indicted by a
civilian judge, Carlos Cerda, in the cases of 10 members of the
Communist Party members who disappeared after being arrested in
1976.
   After Judge Cerda filed the charges, however, the Santiago
Appeals Court ordered him to stop the proceedings and apply the
amnesty law in the case.
   Cerda refused, but the Appeals Court suspended him from his job
for two months, applying the amnesty law. That suspension also was
upheld Friday by the Supreme Court.

   A frustrated spokeswoman for Rep. Mickey
Leland lashed out Friday at U.S. efforts to find the missing
congressman, saying work should ``get going with the kind of steam,
the kind of urgency'' that President Bush promised.
   ``It just seems to me that with all of the sophisticated
surveillance that we have, with all of the sophisticated equipment
we have, we could have and should have located them by now,'' said
Alma Newsom.
   ``What has taken the U.S. forces so long to gain momentum?'' she
asked. ``I'm not suggesting ... there is a lack of commitment from
the top. I believe President Bush fully expected that everything,
that all stops had been pulled out. At any rate it isn't
happening.''
   Bush, the State Department and the Defense Department defended
the efforts to find Leland, D-Texas, whose plane disappeared in
Ethiopia on the way to a refugee camp.
   The president said, ``I can understand the anxiety of all this
and I can understand the concern that people that love Mickey
Leland feel and that I feel. But there's a lot going on, so let's
just hope and pray he's OK.''
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said, ``I
know the president and the secretary of state deeply and sincerely
empathize with the frustration, with the tension, with the
situation she's having to deal with. ...''
   Ms. Tutwiler denied there had been any breakdown in the search
effort.
   Later, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater issued a
statement calling the U.S. commitment to the search ``the largest,
most comprehensive undertaking in recent memory.''
   Fitzwater recounted the resources, including Air Force planes,
that the United States had committed to the search effort for
Leland's plane, which was carrying eight Americans and seven other
people in addition to the congressman when it disappeared.
   ``The U.S. commitment coupled with thousands of Ethiopians
making ground searches, will continue,'' he said.
   However, Ms. Newsom said Leland's staff believes ``somebody had
dropped the ball'' in the search for Leland, who vanished Monday
after his plane took off from Addis Ababa for a refugee camp on the
Sudanese border.
   She said she was appealing to Bush to ``issue a strong statement
to all of his people that this is a priority, they've got to work
together and they have got to get their act together and find
congressman Leland and his party. That is unequivocal.''
   Ms. Newsom said she and others gathered in Leland's office had
spent the night calling other congressmen to urge the Pentagon to
move more quickly.
   Two of those contacted, Reps. Jack Fields, R-Texas, and Ron
Coleman, D-Texas, said they called administration officials.
   Fields said he doesn't believe there is a lack of commitment at
the top, but that the rescue may have been slowed by the logistics
of moving personnel and equipment to Ethiopia, as well as that
country's failure to immediately signal it welcomed U.S. help.
   Friday night, Timmy Jensen of Leland' staff said the staff was
encouraged by word that helicopters would be searching Friday
despite a ``weather report (that) isn't very good.
   ``The more up there looking for them the better,'' she said.
   State Department spokeswoman Tutwiler said that as of Friday the
Defense Department had sent a C-141 with a 35-person medical team;
two HC-130 search and rescue aircraft, each with a parachute team;
two C-141s with spare parts and support equipment; a C-21 to
transport U-2 film; a C-5 with four MH-60 helicopters. Two more
HC-130s were dispatched from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.
   In a statement detailing additional efforts, the Pentagon said
two U-2 photographic reconnaissance planes had exposed more than a
mile of film in runs over the 56,000-square mile search area, of
which about 60 percent was covered by clouds.
   This is an area as large as that contained by a line from New
York City to Nagshead, N.C., to Pittsburgh and back to New York, or
in Texas from Dallas to Houston to Midland and back to Dallas, the
Pentagonn said.
   The Pentagon said it was sending an additional EC-130 equipped
as a command and control craft, and additional flight crews so that
each airplane and helicopter would have two crews assigned and
could be put to maximum use.
   As of Friday, 170 U.S. military personnel had been assigned to
the search and the number soon would reach 260, the Pentagon said.
   Air Force Maj. Gen. James F. Record, director of operations for
Central Command, will leave Saturday to take charge of the effort
in Ethiopia, the Pentagon said.
   Two U.S. Air Force HC-130 Hercules cargo planes, equipped to
detect emergency signals from downed aircraft, flew over the areas
Thursday without hearing anything, and ground parties reported no
sightings. Two Ethiopian air force helicopters also came up blank.
   On Friday, the HC-130s were back flying parallel routes along a
200-mile portion of the missing plane's presumed path.

   A federal judge on Friday decided to allow
police to use ``pain compliance'' techniques against anti-abortion
protesters affiliated with Operation Rescue.
   Such techniques involve bending a wrist or arm backward against
its joint, and, increasingly, the use of a an oriential martial
arts weapon known as nunchakus.
   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima, in refusing to issue a
temporary restraining order, said lawyers failed to show that
abortion foes were likely to be injured.
   ``I think under the law of this state ... officers are entitled
to use such reasonable force as necessary to take the person into
custody,'' Tashima said.
   Tashima also said that the abortion foes' lawyers had failed to
show a protest was likely to occur Saturday.
   ``Essentially, the judge said there's no case in controversy
because we don't know there's going to be a demonstration
tomorrow,'' said Samuel B. Casey, a lawyer representing six
anti-abortion protesters.
   ``We will enforce the law as we have in the past,'' said
Commander William Booth, a police spokesman. ``And when we have to
make an arrest, if there are resistances, pain compliance will be
used.''
   The nunchakus used by police, which Booth described as a ``come
along device,'' consists of two foot-long pieces of plastic that
are attached by a cord and are used like walnut crackers on a
person's arm or leg.
   Tashima said the issues presented by the case were novel, but he
was not persuaded that anti-abortion protesters are entitled to
court protection, said Jack Brown, an assistant city attorney.
   ``He said there was a question as to whether the demonstrators
were resisting arrest,'' said Brown, who represented the Police
Department in the hearing.
   Instead of issuing the emergency restraining order sought by
Casey, Tashima set a hearing for Oct. 2 to consider further
evidence and arguments.
   Police in Los Angeles developed pain compliance to counter
Operation Rescue's strategy of illegally blocking entrances to a
women's health clinic and delaying arrests to keep the clinic
closed.
   Operation Rescue protesters are taught a variety of methods to
passively resist arrest. Some have smeared their arms and legs with
petroleum jelly to make it more difficult for arresting officers to
grip them.
   The request for a temporary restraining order was filed Thursday
by The Rutherford Institute of California, a conservative,
Christian-oriented, public interest group.

   A summer thundershower rolled across
the South Dakota prairie Friday as the remains of Seminole Indians
were reburied near the site where Sioux Indians were killed by
soldiers almost a century ago.
   About 1,200 pounds of prehistoric remains of members of the
Seminole Tribe were returned to the earth after being stored in
boxes at the University of South Dakota for the past three years.
   A traditional ceremony was held Friday evening less than a mile
from the cemetery where Sioux Indians were buried following the
slaying of more than 200 Sioux on Dec. 29, 1890, by soldiers of the
U.S. Army's 7th Cavalry.
   The 1890 assault _ known as the Wounded Knee massacre to Indians
and a battle to the U.S. Army _ was one of the last major conflicts
between Indians and soldiers. It occurred just 14 days after
Sitting Bull was killed on the Standing Rock Reservation.
   ``There's an awful lot of power here, this is a powerful
place,'' said Mike Haney, a representative of the Seminole Tribe of
Oklahoma who was asked by tribal leaders in Florida to attend the
ceremony.
   ``One of the reasons I'm here is because I'm from the Alligater
clan of the Seminole people,'' Haney said. ``Traditionally, we (the
clan) bury our people.''
   Indians and archaeologists took turns digging a 6-foot-deep
grave atop a hill surrounded by pine trees.
   ``We want them to dig, we want them to finish the job they
started,'' said Roger Byrd, a spiritual leader of the Oglala Sioux
who said prayers over the gravesite, which will become part of the
National Indian Cemetery.
   ``As Indians we are all the same and we return to the ground the
same,'' Byrd said.
   Arrangements for the reburial were made with the help of
American Indians Against Desecration, a group that has been
fighting for reburial rights for the past decade.
   ``We're making sure we bury these people in a place that will
never be touched by archaeologists,'' Jan Bear Shield, a founder of
AIAD, said. ``That is why we picked Wounded Knee. As long as there
is an Indian alive, they will never touch it.''
   It is not known how many skeletons were buried Friday because
the remains, which included earth and Seminole burial articles,
were not studied by archaeologists.
   Larry Zimmerman, a professor of anthropology at the University
of South Dakota, was asked by members of the Seminole Tribe to
catalog the contents of the boxes containing the remains. They
appeared to be prehistoric, he said.
   The remains were unearthed at a construction site near Tampa,
Fla.
   Zimmerman was part of a similar reburial in 1981 following the
discovery of 500 people, ancestors to the contemporary Arikaras, at
the Crow Creek archaeological site near Fort Thompson. The
skeletons found at that site in 1978 were all victims of a massacre
that scientists have said occurred before white men arrived in the
region.
   The ceremony at Wounded Knee, on the Pine Ridge Reservation,
followed a four-day World Archaelogical Congress symposium on the
reburial issue.
   At the Inter-congress, the executive committee introduced the
Vermillion Accord, which calls for increased cooperation between
indigenous people and the scientific community when deaing with
archaeological remains.
   About 200 people from 20 nations attended the conference, which
ended Thursday in Vermillion.
   Some of the archaeologists who were at the conference also were
at the reburial and took part in digging the grave.
   ``I feel satisfied, comfortable about it,'' Zimmerman said.
``Although these bones weren't dug up by archaeologists, I think it
is important to get them back.''

   A woman who fled New Hampshire with her two
young children in November, after a court gave their custody to her
ex-husband, was found Friday and the children taken from her.
   ``I have no idea how they found me,'' Jesse Murabito, 40, said
in a telephone interview after two law officers and a social worker
entered the home she rents here and took her 6-year-old daughter
and 4-year-old son.
   ``The boy started screaming and crying,'' she said, crying
herself. ``He didn't want to leave me. He said, `Momma, don't let
them take me.'''
   She said the authorities told her the children would be put in a
foster home until a hearing Thursday in Fort Benton in the 12th
Judicial District in Chouteau County.
   ``They had to carry out my daughter,'' Mrs. Murabito said. ``I
have no idea where they are. They won't tell me.''
   Fort Benton Sheriff Paul Williams, who helped take the children
from their home, said Mrs. Murabito cried and screamed as her
children were taken away.
   ``The kids were crying because their mother was crying,''
Williams said. ``She was screaming and yelling and I think that
upset the kids.''
   Diann Button, a social worker for the Montana Department of
Family Services, accompanied sheriff's deputies to Mrs. Murabito's
home in this town of about 80 people on the Missouri River about
125 miles northeast of Helena.
   Button said the children have been placed in a foster home in
the area, but would not say where. She said she talked to the
children, but ``they're pretty confused right now.''
   Mrs. Murabito, her ex-husband, Mark Russell Murabito, and others
involved in the case will be at next week's hearing, the social
worker said.
   Raymond Kellett, a lawyer for Mark Murabito, said Friday night
that this is the first time since November that Murabito has known
where his children are. His client will fly to Montana to attend
the hearing, the lawyer said.
   ``He's very relieved that the children have been found,''
Kellett said. ``Mr. Murabito is very relieved and happy at the
prospects of getting the children back.''
   Kellett said he contacted Williams on Thursday about the
children, but would not disclose how he had learned about Mrs.
Murabito's whereabouts. Williams said he knew nothing of the case
until contacted by Kellett.
   The case attracted national attention during the couple's
divorce proceedings when Mrs. Murabito went to jail for a week in
February 1987 rather than tell the court her children's whereabouts.
   Murabito, 34, of Derry, N.H., was indicted in March 1988 on a
charge of sexually abusing the daughter, but acquitted during a
two-week trial in November.
   A Superior Court judge in New Hampshire then stripped her of the
children's custody, awarded him joint custody with the state. Mrs.
Murabito disappeared the same day with the children.
   She said she has been living in Loma since April under the name
of Pat Gibeau. Mrs. Murabito said she had a friend living there.
Previously, they had stopped in San Francisco and other places, she
said, but declined to elaborate.
   ``I've been trying to protect my children. It's been so hard for
me, so hard,'' Mrs. Murabito said.
   She said earlier this year during telephone conversations with
reporters from undisclosed locations that she had used a nationwide
``underground railway'' to flee.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Church Leaders Urge U.S. Not To Hamper Peace Process</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic Church leaders on
Thursday urged the United States to help restore peace in Central
America by not hampering a recent accord to disband the Nicaraguan
rebels.
   ``The U.S. government must support the accord, since it is no
secret that it is financing the irregular forces camped in
Honduras,'' Archbishop Carlos Santi, general secretary of the
conference of Nicaraguan bishops said.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
Bush administration was ``generally supportive'' of the accord
signed Monday by five Central American presidents. He said,
however, there was skepticism that Nicaragua's Sandinista
government will carry out the democratic reforms it has promised.
   ``The Central American presidents must fulfill the accord signed
in Tela, Honduras, but the U.S. government also should not hamper
these treaties, contributing to peace in the region,'' Fitzwater
said.
   The accord calls for disbanding and resettling the rebels, known
as Contras, by the first week of December. It also urges that the
U.S.-backed government of El Salvador and the leftist guerrillas
resume peace negotiations.
   On Thursday, Defense Minister Humberto Ortega publicly ordered
the Nicaraguan army to extend ``all guarantees of personal safety''
to any Contras who want to return home.
   Ortega _ President Daniel Ortega's brother _ said in a
communique that he ordered the action after learning that Col.
Enrique Bermudez and other top Contra military leaders living in
Miami applied for asylum in the United States.
   About 11,000 Contras and 12,000 dependents live in squalid camps
in southern Honduras, near the Nicaraguan border. For the past
year, they have received only non-lethal aid from the United States
such as boots and foodstuffs.
   President Ortega has promised to hold free and fair national
elections on Feb. 25. He also got Nicaragua's 20 opposition
political parties to back the peace plan.
   A spokesman for Protestant denominations in Nicaragua said,
``all U.S. churches could use the accord as a weapon to demand that
their government should not interfere in the region's affairs.''
   The Rev. Miguel Angelo Caso, an evangelist, called the Tela
accord ``a painful and bloody birth, in which a spark of life is
present.''
   In San Jose, Costa Rica, President Oscar Arias received a
message from Mikhail Gorbachev in which the Soviet president said
Moscow would send no more arms to Nicaragua.
   In a message transmitted Thursday to Arias by Alexander Mokanuu,
vice president of the Soviet Parliament, Gorbachev told reporters
he supports the Central American peace plan.
   Both the Soviet Union and Cuba have supplied the Sandinistas
with weapons and military assistance for the past eight years.
   In San Salvador, members of a commission promoting peace talks
between the rightist government and Marxist-led guerrillas said
Thursday they found good will and determination on both sides to
solve the 9-year-old war.
   A Salvadoran rebel spokeswoman told a Honduran radio station the
guerrilla army ``is willing to lay down its weapons in order to
achieve a lasting peace in El Salvador.''
   The commission comprises the three main opposition political
parties.
   Four rounds of negotiations between 1984 and 1987 failed to
produce a breakthrough toward ending El Salvador's civil war, in
which an estimated 70,000 people have died.

   Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad issued a
warning Thursday that terrorists might bomb targets on the British
mainland to mark the 20th anniversary next week of the deployment
of troops in Northern Ireland.
   The Irish Republican Army was not named in the statement, which
urged the public to be vigilant during ``this emotive time in
Ireland's history.''
   But the IRA has waged a bloody campaign, mainly in Northern
Ireland, to drive the British from the Protestant-controlled
province and unite it with the mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   The IRA has hit British targets on the European continent and
waged bomb campaigns on the British mainland _ including a bomb
attempt on the life of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her
Cabinet on Oct. 12, 1984.
   A new barrier designed to guard against suicide car-bombers was
being installed Thursday at Downing Street, where the prime
minister has her office and residence.
   Monday marks the 20th anniversary of the arrival of British
troops in the province.
   ``Attacks on the mainland against commercial and other
non-military targets during this period cannot be ruled out,'' a
Scotland Yard spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   He urged people to be on the lookout for suspicious packages,
especially on the London subway, on buses and in department stores.

   Emergency workers used a tow truck to haul
an 1,100-pound horse out of an abandoned well Thursday after the
animal fell into water up to its neck.
   ``It's a good thing he didn't go down head first,'' said Bob
Miller, an associate professor at the University of Missouri
veterinary school.
   Boone County firefighter and University veterinary faculty and
students helped rescue Marty, a 4-year-old gelding. Marty was
turned loose Wednesday with some dairy cows in an oat field in west
Audrain County.
   ``We turned the horse and the cows in here so they could eat the
oats,'' said Perry Miller, who lives on the farm. ``We never
thought about the well.''
   There are no barriers around the well. When the horse failed to
appear by Thursday morning, Miller, who is not related to Bob
Miller, went looking for Marty and found him with his head above
the fetid water.
   Bob Miller was lowered by rope into the 4-foot-deep hole and
tranquilized the animal. He helped loop a rope around the animal's
shoulders, and the tow truck pulled Marty free.

   The North American representative of
the Polisario Front guerrilla group has defected to Morocco, the
official MAP news agency reported.
   Omar Hadrami, a leading member of the group fighting for the
independence of the Western Sahara, arrived in Casablanca on
Wednesday in response to a call from King Hassan II for Polisario
members to give up their struggle, MAP said.
   Hadrami, 40, was based in New York. He was one of the 25 members
of the Polisario's Political Bureau.
   No immediate comment came from the organization, which is based
in neighboring Algeria.
   In a speech Nov. 6, Hassan called on all Polisario members
``with a drop of Moroccan blood in their veins'' to change sides in
a struggle that has lasted nearly 15 years. ``The motherland is
merciful and compassionate,'' the king said.
   The Polisario Front has been waging a desert battle against
Moroccan soldiers since the North African country annexed the
territory, the former Spanish Sahara, in 1975. Military action has
been at a virtual standstill for months as the United Nations tries
to mediate between the two sides, trying for a referendum in the
territory.

DC-10s despite two explosive engine failures within a month, the
nation's top aviation official says.
   ``It's safe to fly. I would fly in the aircraft today,'' Federal
Aviation Administrator James B. Busey said Thursday, less than 24

   For the second time in his first six weeks on the job, Busey

   Public health officials must prepare now to
meet an expected upswing in youth suicides in the late 1990s, says
a task force that recommends educating more people about the
warning signs.
   In a report released late Thursday, the task force said that
while mental illness is often related to suicide, many young people
who take their own lives don't have a major mental illness.
   ``An estimated one-third of all young people who commit suicide
do not appear to fit the known picture _ suicides occur in loving
and supportive families as well as in disrupted families, among
high-achieving as well as low-achieving students,'' said the report.
   The task force was appointed in May 1985 by then-Secretary of
Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler and held a series of
national conferences on youth suicide.

   A divorce trial to determine the fate of
seven frozen human embryos has ended, leaving the judge to decide
whether a man can stop his estranged wife from using them.
   ``On one hand, this case involves the ageless power of sexual
reproduction. On the other hand, it involves a branch of science
and man's ability to understand and control nature, which is as new
as today's headlines,'' Charles Clifford, attorney for Junior Lewis
Davis, said in closing arguments Thursday.
   Junior Davis, 30, sued Mary Sue Davis, 28, for a divorce in
February. He asked the court to prevent her from using the seven
frozen embryos they created through an in vitro fertilization
program last December. He contends he has as much right to decide
their fate as his wife.
   Davis wants the embryos, stored at a Knoxville hospital, to
remain frozen.
   But Mrs. Davis says she should be allowed to have the embryos
implanted in her womb, arguing they represent her best chance of
becoming a mother. She also contends Davis is asking to acquire a
right not normally given to a man _ the decision on whether a child
should be born after he has fertilized the egg of his mate.

   The nation's health officials are scrambling to
contain a 370 percent rise in the number of measles cases after
years in which the old childhood nemesis virtually disappeared as a
public health problem.
   More than 8,400 people have caught measles so far in 1989, and
as many as 25 have died, according to the national Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta.
   ``It's not really clear why. It's probably a variety of
things,'' said Dr. William Atkinson of the CDC.
   Lack of immunizations is playing a big part, especially in inner
city Hispanic and black neighborhoods, where many youngsters are
going without the measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations they should
receive starting at 15 months of age.
   ``We have to reach the parents and really convince them of the
importance of having the child vaccinated,'' Atkinson said
Wednesday. ``There are publicly funded clinics where children can
receive vaccines for little or no cost.''

   Their motto is ``Be Prepared,'' but some
Boy Scouts say they were not ready for what they found at a rainy

   Half the 19,000 Scouts were girls.
   ``When we have a Boy Scout Jamboree in the states, it's strictly

scoutmaster of an American troop for the children of U.S. soldiers

   Eight Soviet boys also were among the 2,500 visitors from 26

   ``This is first time we have had Soviets at a Norwegian

don't have scouting,'' said camp spokesman Per-Olav Lie.

   The college football season probably will be
over by then, but ABC's ``Coach'' will be back on the gridiron
sometime around the middle of the 1989-90 television season.
   Creator and executive producer Barry Kemp blames himself for
creating the impression that the show, which premiered midseason
last season, had been canceled by ABC. He had been disappointed
that it wasn't in ABC's starting lineup and took his time accepting
the order for 13 new episodes, so when ABC announced its fall
schedule, the fate of ``Coach'' was unknown.
   ``I wasn't real happy about being a back-up show last year,''
said Kemp during a visit to New York. ``It's just hard to be a show
about football in the fall and not be able to go on in the fall. .
.. But now that theyve put us on this summer behind `Roseanne,' I
think that shows a lot of faith in us.''
   Indeed, ``Coach'' has been exposed to a much wider audience
behind the hit sitcom on Tuesday night this summer.
   Kemp, who was executive script consultant on ``Taxi'' for three
seasons and created and produced ``Newhart,'' ``Coming of Age'' and
the comedy miniseries ``Fresno,'' said he had spent about two years
developing ``Coach.''
   Craig T. Nelson plays Hayden Fox, head coach of Minnesota State.
His life is turned upside-down when his 19-year-old daughter, Kelly
(Clare Carey), from his long-since-dissolved marriage, enrolls at
the university. Jerry Van Dyke, in a role created for him, plays
relentlessly negative Assistant Coach Luther Van Dam _ who gets in
trouble for accepting a steak he won by betting against his own
team. Shelley Fabares is Christine Armstrong, a local newswoman who
is Hayden's steady date. Bill Fagerbakke is perpetual student
Dauber Dybinski, whose academic inertia might possibly stem from
his insistence on taking only courses that are taught in proximity
to his dorm.
   But it was the charismatic character of a college football coach
that drew him to the idea of the series, said Kemp, who describes
himself as an avid football fan.
   ``I was real interested in the whole phenomenon that had
happened in the last decade or so where the prominence of coaches
had become such they were really more prominent than the players in
many cases,'' he said.
   He was also attracted to doing a show about ``a guy who was 45
years old and was just starting to come to terms with the fact that
he had basically devoted his life to achieving some kind of career
goal, and had risked his marriage and his family life and his
personal relationships in order to attain that, and was just
starting to come to terms with the fact that it was not going to be
all he hoped it would be, and had to start trying to mend the
fences he had broken through the years. I thought that an
interesting emotional dilemma for a man that age. And that really
appealed to me.''
   Nelson, who is best known for his movie roles in such dramatic
fare as ``Poltergeist'' would not immediately leap to most minds as
the star of a sitcom, but Kemp said he was interested enough in the
actor that he talked to him about the ``Coach'' concept even before
the script was written.
   ``I think the reaction a lot of people had was I didn't think
Craig Nelson could be funny,'' Kemp said. But he wanted more than a
sitcom actor, and the imposing Nelson fit the bill.
   ``I wanted Hayden Fox to have an edge, I wanted a really good
actor to play him,'' Kemp said, adding that Fox ``walks that pretty
fine moral line between what's considered right and what's
considered wrong, and he's not always real clear about it. So he
fights that dilemma within himself all the time, and that makes him
interesting.''
   Kemp, who grew up in Iowa, set ``Coach'' at the fictitious
Minnesota State mainly to be realistic. It's not a top 40 school,
but maybe top 100. Sometimes the school sounds a little too
realistic.
   ``One of the guys in the show was wearing the sweatshirt one day
that had the logo on it,'' Kemp said, ``and he was in a 7-Eleven,
and the guy behind the counter said, `Hey I went to that school.'''

<HEAD>Writer sees FBI Agent Nick Mancuso as Old-Fashioned Idealist</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Writer-producer Steve Sohmer says he sees the
hero of his upcoming NBC series as an old-fashioned idealist who's
a dinosaur in today's FBI.
   The show ``Mancuso, FBI,'' starring Robert Loggia as Nick
Mancuso, is a spinoff from the miniseries thriller ``Favorite Son.''
   Sohmer, who wrote the best-selling novel about political
corruption in Washington, and adapted it for the miniseries, said
what excites him most about Mancuso is that idealism.
   ``He's had a lifelong love affair with the Constitution,'' he
said. ``But when you look at him you know only blind justice would
choose this man as her champion. Everyone underestimates him. He's
the hero of the 1990s because he believes passionately in his
country and wishes the country would live up to its principles.''
   The miniseries, which ran last fall prior to the presidential
election, told of a conspiracy to boost the candidacy of a handsome
senator for vice president. At the time, Republicans protested that
there were certain similarities to candidate Dan Quayle. Sohmer
pointed out that the book was written and the miniseries was filmed
long before anyone knew Quayle would be the Republican candidate
for vice president.
   Mancuso, along with his secretary, played by Randi Brazen, and
Charles Siebert as the head of forensics, are holdovers from the
miniseries. New members of the cast are Lindsay Frost as a Justice
Department lawyer and a special agent in charge, yet to be cast.
   Sohmer is executive producer of ``Mancuso, FBI,'' which will be
filmed in Los Angeles with some second-unit work in Washington.
   ``Mancuso is a very personal guy with me,'' said Sohmer. ``He's
a character based on an amalgam of things I feel, some of my
father, my grandfather.
   ``He's a guy in a $10 suit who can never get his tie all the way
up. He's not prepossessing. He's a man who's a first-generation
American born to immigrant parents who taught him this is the
greatest country in the world. After college and law school, he
joined the Army out of patriotism and became a military policeman.
There he was recruited for the FBI.''
   Sohmer said he has asked for FBI cooperation in filming the
series, but said he will not give the agency script approval.
   ``I want to make this as close to FBI policy, rules and
procedures as possible,'' he said. Agents who have seen the show's
FBI office set say it's authentic.
   ``But this really isn't a show about the FBI. It's about people
in trouble, American ideals, the law and how people try to subvert
those ideals and place themselves above the law. It's David vs.
Goliath.''
   Each episode begins with what appears to be a run-of-the-mill
case. But it soon turns into a crime where the stakes are very high.
   An investigation of a murder at a Department of Energy facility
turns out to be a plot by one of our allies to steal fissionable
material. In another story, the press uncovers what appears to be
the womanizing past of a cabinet appointee. But Mancuso discovers a
plot to discredit the appointee.
   In addition to his writing and his producing duties for
``Mancuso,'' Sohmer recently became president of Nelson Television.
Doing triple-duty leads to a schedule in which he begins writing at
five in the morning. At eight, he conducts story conferences for
the series, and at 11 he goes to his office at Nelson.
   His second book, ``The Russian Doll,'' will be published soon by
G.P. Putnam's Sons. It involves a military conspiracy during the
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks. The leading character is a woman
Air Force lieutenant.
   Sohmer is a former executive at CBS and NBC and a former
president of Columbia Pictures.
   When ``Favorite Son'' was published three years ago, Brandon
Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, and his wife, Lily,
volunteered to be hosts of a book party.
   ``When I got to the party Brandon said, `I want to do a
miniseries and then make the cop a series.''' Sohmer recalled. ``I
was on top of the world.''
   Sohmer also wrote the upcoming NBC movie, ``Hidden Rage,''
starring Jaclyn Smith as a Chicago policewoman who returns to her
hometown to confront the man who raped her 20 years before.
   Next up, he will write two miniseries. He was reluctant to give
details, but described one as ``a look at America in turmoil in the
1960s.'' The other is set in Washington.

   Ron Howard recalls how his early life as a
child actor on ``The Andy Griffith Show'' led to his becoming a
director.
   ``I loved the environment of a movie set; it was always fun. It
was work, and there was some discipline involved, but it was fun
for me. When I got a little older _ 7-8-9 _ I became interested in
the camera. You know how boys are interested in gadgets. I spent a
lot of time hanging around with the camera crew,'' he said.
   ``I soon saw that the director was the person who got to hang
out with the actors, which was fun, and he also got to hang around
the camera and look through it and make decisions about it. Very
early on, I thought that was going to be an interesting job, and
I'd like to try it.''
   Howard didn't wait long. At 21 he directed a cheapie for Roger
Corman, ``Grand Theft Auto.'' After leaving the ``Happy Days'' TV
series, he made a successful comedy with his series co-star, Henry
Winkler, and Michael Keaton. Next came his ``Splash'' smash,
followed by ``Cocoon,'' ``Gung Ho'' and ``Willow.''
   Now, ``Parenthood.''
   ``It's really the first time that I've done a movie that was
personal to me,'' said Howard. ``And it's the first time I've done
a movie that was one of my own ideas.''
   The inception came with a horrendous plane flight which he and
his wife were able to laugh about later. He thought that if they
could laugh about such a happening, perhaps comedy could be found
in other serious matters _ such as raising children.
   Howard, father of three daughters, began collecting other such
stories from his own memory and those of friends. He worked with
his regular writers, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, to develop the
script of ``Parenthood.''
   How do today's parents differ from a generation ago?
   ``The baby boomer group, of which I'm a member, don't seem to go
at anything halfway,'' he said. ``Now that they're turning their
attention to family and child-rearing, they're doing it with a real
fervor, a real commitment. They want to be different. They've
always wanted to be different, and better, and have more
information and more choices. It's a more complicated time.''
   The central figure of ``Parenthood'' is Steve Martin as a
husband who tries to balance his work with the responsibilities of
fatherhood. Surrounding him is a family that includes Mary
Steenburgen, Jason Robards, Tom Hulce, Dianne Wiest, Rick Moranis,
Martha Plimpton and Keanu Reeves.
   Howard said he had no trouble keeping the ensemble cast happy.
``They all believed in the script. They had a lot of fun when they
were there. I didn't have to do any of the hand-holding and
ego-massaging that I frankly expected would be an important part of
my job.
   ``They loved the ensemble nature of the film. These are all
people who starred in their own movies. In a way, I think they kind
of enjoyed not having that kind of responsibility and yet still
being a part of something they believed in.''
   Seven movies isn't a great body of work for a director, but
Howard believes a pattern may have emerged.
   ``I tend to be character-oriented,'' he said. ``Even when I was
doing fantasies like `Splash' and `Willow' and `Cocoon,' what was
in it for me was the scenes in which the actors could shine. I
think `Parenthood' is an extension of that, with all the sci-fi
stuff stripped away.''

<TEXT>
   Old problems generally can benefit from fresh
insight. That insight might not solve them in a flash, but often it
can reroute the intellectual pursuit, helping to hurdle or sidestep
obstacles.
   Americans, for example, are forever being berated by economists
for lax savings habits, and the Japanese are often praised for
theirs. That perspective has existed for years, and nobody's done
anything about it.
   John Reed doesn't think that's right. Reed, chairman of Citicorp
and its chief banking subsidiary, Citibank, views the scene from a
different perspective.
   In a briefing for members of Congress about the growing service
industry _ he is chairman of the board of the Coalition of Service
Industries _ Reed offered this observation:
   ``We put our savings in houses. On a gross basis, we save more
than the Japanese, but some of that savings is utilized by
households as trillions of dollars worth of investment in mortgages.
   ``By the standards of American culture, we are not sustaining a
pattern of bad habits. Rather, we use our savings for things that
most of the Congress would view as socially good and desirable.
   ``In our business (financial and other services) we must
intermediate the world's capital flow so that U.S. industry can
have the benefit of the low-cost savings of Japan...
   ``The pool of savings that exists in Japan is equivalent to the
pool of oil that exists in Saudi Arabia. On the margin, oil in
Saudi Arabia has no value whatever.
   ``If there were a law that said Saudis could not export oil they
would not know what to do with it. If there were a law in Japan
saying the Japanese could not export capital they would also not
know what to do with it.''
   In short, the effect of these cultural differences between Japan
and America may be thought of as complementary, rather than in
terms of Japanese strength and American weakness.
   Reed did lament one aspect of this financial flow. ``It is a
great tragedy,'' he said, ``that developing countries are not able
to tap these pools of savings.'' Almost all such flows, he said,
are toward developed countries.
   This latter observation relates to another lamentable situation
identified in ``The State of The Nation's Housing 1989,'' a study
by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.
   As popularly perceived, two of the major socioeconomic problems
today are inadequate housing for the poor and a growing gap between
the rich and the poor. The center's study indicates the problems
might be one and the same.
   That study showed that in 1986 only 11.5 percent or 1.28 million
of the estimated 11.1 million renter households in the 25-34 age
group had both the required cash and incomes high enough to qualify
for a starter home mortgage.
   The bigger of the problems was the down payment; 81 percent
lacked the accumulated wealth needed to close on a mortgage.
   Question: Can such families save fast enough to overcome the
rising levels of downpayments required? Recent history suggests
many of them cannot, because housing prices, and downpayments, have
risen faster than wage increases.
   Unable to buy, many of these households are forced to remain
poor. Home ownership, it has been demonstrated repeatedly, is the
most efficient way for households of limited means to acquire
sizable equity, i.e., wealth.
   In short, the house is the vehicle that closes the gap between
``rich'' and poor. But it is a vehicle the poor often cannot board.
There are seats on the vehicle, but there is a fare to be paid too.
And the poor haven't got it.
   Various solutions to the dilemma have been offered, but the best
approach is open to debate. Still, one of those approaches cannot
be easily dismissed because it might even pay for itself. The
center points out:
   ``Over time, the incomes of many young owners are likely to
increase and, as noted, homeownership usually yields substantial
equity buildup.
   ``In many instances, financial assistance with the up-front
costs or mortgage payments could be repaid in full or in part over
the course of the loan or when the home is sold.''
   In short, by helping people to own housing we help bridge the
gap between the rich and the poor. And by taking the savings of the
Japanese we provide them with a good return for their troubles
while buying houses for ourselves.

<TEXT>
   Life as a rock star in pre-glasnost Russia
wasn't all-night parties, screaming fans or MTV promos. Boris
Grebenshikov didn't deal with groupies; he was questioned by the
KGB.
   ``They would talk to me, and tell me, `Don't say a word to
anyone.' And of course, I would tell everyone. It was the only
weapon I had,'' said Grebenshikov, an underground rock phenomenon
in the Soviet Union since 1972.
   Grebenshikov survived his outlaw status, releasing a dozen
``albums'' _ actually bootlegged cassettes _ through the Soviet
Union's black market. Things are different now; he sits in a
friend's Manhattan penthouse apartment to discuss ``Radio
Silence,'' his debut Western album.
   ``My life was saved by rock 'n' roll. Absolutely,'' said
Grebenshikov, speaking perfect English while chain-smoking Soviet
cigarettes.
   He worked without his band, Aquarium, on ``Radio Silence.''
Instead, Grebenshikov hooked up with Dave Stewart of Eurythmics,
who produced the album. Other high-powered help was brought in as
well _ Stewart's partner, Annie Lennox, the Pretenders' Chrissie
Hynde and actor Harry Dean Stanton all contribute vocals to the
album.
   While Grebenshikov appreciates their help and friendship, this
rock 'n' roll innocent's introduction to the music industry in the
United States has been less than pleasant.
   An appearance on ``Late Night With David Letterman'' rankled;
Letterman insisted on talking about how much money Grebenshikov
might make. Grebenshikov filmed a rush-job video in Times Square;
asked about it, he sadly shakes his head.
   The non-stop promotional whirl, which includes a tour now
underway, also was a shock. And there's the emphasis on selling
records, which Grebenshikov dismisses with a two-syllable American
obscenity.
   ``You go to Tower Records, and you have rows and rows of
product, but maybe three or four good records,'' he says,
disdainfully.
   This wasn't what Grebenshikov knew as rock 'n' roll when he sat
in his bedroom in the Soviet Union, twisting the radio dial in a
frantic search for the music which he said would set him free.
   Each Beatles single was a revelation. His early exposure to Bob
Dylan had the same intense effect on him as it did on a New Jersey
teen-ager a world away, Bruce Springsteen.
   ``I remember hearing `I Want You.' I could understand about
maybe 70 percent, but I thought to myself: This is it. This is the
sound,'' said Grebenshikov, 35, who wrote in English for the first
time on ``Radio Silence.''
   He went on to form Aquarium in 1972. In short order, he was both
kicked out of the Communist Youth League for his musical efforts
and dubbed the Soviet Dylan; he also became the focus of Eric
Clapton-esque graffiti (``Boris is God'') in Leningrad.
   Grebenshikov is unsure how many Aquarium tapes are out there in
the Soviet Union; once the group was legitimized by the government,
its first three albums sold 3{ million copies on the official
Melodiya label.
   Not that numbers matter to the charismatic Grebenshikov; they
don't. Neither does a perfect mix or exacting production on his
records; he's more interested in how a record feels when he listens
to it.
   ``I don't really care how good it sounds. I care about, what am
I doing? Is the inspiration here? 'Cause people tend to hide behind
the sound. ... Even if it's a perfect thing, sounds great _ I don't
care, I just don't care,'' says Grebenshikov.
   ``Give me some sounds, so we can fly with it, we can soar with
it. ... I don't care about how it sounds. If it's right, it's
right.''

<DATELINE>UNION GAP, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who sang the eternal question,
``Woman, have you got cheating on your mind?,'' is back with a new
sound and harsh criticism for the music of the 1980s.
   Gary Puckett, minus the Union Gap, plans to release his first
album in nearly 20 years this fall, and warns his old fans not to
expect the same old sound.
   ``If they want another record like `Young Girl,' it's not what
they're going to get,'' he said. ``You can't (make) a record that
sounds like 1968.
   ``But it's still me singing. The voice is recognizable.''
   The 46-year-old Puckett's booming voice was one of the most
recognizable in rock in the late '60s. He grew up in Yakima and
named his original band after this small suburb. But he contends
that the band name was initially chosen because of his interest in
the Civil War and especially the Union forces.
   ``When I thought of that, I decided why not call it Union Gap,''
Puckett said. ``It meant something to me. It was a sneaky little
twist nobody would understand.''
   The name also allowed the group to dress up in Civil War
uniforms, with Puckett wearing the rank of general.
   But the whole issue is academic because the Union Gap broke up
over creative differences in 1971, and Puckett now tours with three
different musicians as the Gary Puckett Band.
   Puckett, who lives in San Diego, Calif., hasn't had a new record
since 1971, but has signed an agreement with AVM America Inc., a
record company based in Venice, Calif., and plans to have a new
album out in the fall.
   AVM is a new company whose president, Terry Powell, was a
publicist for CBS Records during Puckett's prime, the 1967-69
period when the Union Gap came out with such songs as ``Woman,
Woman,'' ``Over You,'' ``This Girl Is a Woman Now'' and ``Lady
Willpower.''
   Puckett's on-going popularity in Germany inspired the company to
sign him and produce an album, Powell said. ``We think very highly
of Gary,'' he said. ``All his old records are very popular in
Europe.''
   While Puckett hasn't released a record since 1971's ``Keep the
Customer Satisfied,'' he has not been idle. He performed on the
Happy Together reunion tour of several 1960s bands in 1984, and was
an opening act for The Monkees recent reunion tour.
   For the past few years he has been playing fairs and family
festivals. His audiences have primarily been his own age group and
youngsters who are turned off by heavy metal.
   ``It's amazing how many of them are disdainful of hard rock,''
Puckett said. ``They're not into the headbanger stuff. It's kind of
encouraging.''
   Heavy metal and rap music deserve their own categories, he said.
``Don't call it rock.''
   Puckett was born in Hibbing, Minn., and his family moved to
Yakima when he was 5. The family spent a couple of years in Tacoma
before moving back to Yakima when Puckett was in the sixth grade.
They moved again near the end of his junior year of high school,
and he graduated from high school in Twin Falls, Idaho. He formed
the band while a college student at San Diego State in the
mid-1960s.
   Despite his roots in the region, Puckett rarely makes it back to
the Pacific Northwest. His performance at the Central Washington
State Fair in 1987 was his first time back in years, he said. He
was recently here to perform at an antique car show.
   ``Some of the people I knew (came) to the fair,'' he said. ``But
there was kind of a lot of distance between us. It's hard to
remember back. But I always remember it as my home.''
   There has been talk of reuniting the original Union Gap, but
several of the other members have commitments and would ``have to
take a left turn,'' Puckett said. ``It just didn't happen.''

   Anything's possible in Oz, and just about
everything's possible in Hollywood.
   Like Dorothy as a blonde.
   When shooting first began on ``The Wizard of Oz,'' director
Richard Thorpe put Judy Garland in a blond wig. He was later fired
and replaced by Victor Fleming (``Gone With the Wind'') and King
Vidor. Garland ditched the golden locks and played the movie in her
own hair and a fall.
   ``The Wizard of Oz,'' like most movies, abounds with anecdotes
and tales both tall and true.
   There's the story of the ragged coat Frank Morgan wore as
Professor Marvel. It was purportedly purchased from a second-hand
store in Los Angeles and, as the story goes, Morgan pulled out a
pocket one day and found the name L. Frank Baum sewn inside. Baum
wrote the orginal Oz stories.
   Or, when Dorothy first meets the Lion and slaps him for growling
at the Tin Man and Scarecrow, and the lion grabs his tail and
cries. Garland burst into giggles on the set and delayed the shoot.
Fleming, as the legend goes, took Garland behind one of the trees
and slapped her. The scene was shot and the take was good.
   Later, the director called the three vaudeville stars ``hams''
for dancing down the Yellow Brick Road without little Judy.
   And the vaudeville in Bert Lahr allowed him to come up with the
classic movie line, ``unusual weather we're having, ain't it?,''
when Dorothy and friends wake up in the poppy field during a
snowstorm.
   Ray Bolger, who played the Scarecrow, later said, ``We joked a
lot because that was the only way we could survive.''
   Every film has someone who's responsible for ``continuity.'' In
``Oz,'' that meant that every morning someone would count the straw
sticking out of Bolger's costume to make sure it was accurate in
terms of what had already been shot.
   Costumes and makeup took their toll on Bolger, Margaret Hamilton
(the Wicked Witch), Bert Lahr (the Lion) and Jack Haley (the Tin
Woodman). Bolger's skin began to wrinkle because of the Scarecrow
makeup and mask, Haley's 40-pound costume prevented him from
sitting between takes, Hamilton had a green tint to her skin even
when the movie was completed and her fake fingernails were always
popping off.
   Because the movie used more lights and electricity than any
other movie _ it was shot in Technicolor _ the set was unreasonably
hot. Sometimes, it would even smoke up. Lahr, whose costume was
extremely heavy and snug, was drenched in perspiration after
minutes.
   While stories about the ``The Wizard of Oz'' continue to
delight, the movie has grown from a childhood romp to the campy
comebacks of a jaded generation. Memo and note pads abound with
Dorothy's wide-eyed proclamation to Toto once they've landed in Oz:
``I don't think we're in Kansas anymore, Toto.''
   And the Wicked Witch of the West's admonition to Dorothy,
``Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents, too,'' after
Dorothy says that dropping a house on the Wicked Witch of the East
was an accident, is now a popular one-liner.
   But most of all, ``The Wizard of Oz'' will always evoke happy
thoughts of home. As Dorothy said, ``If I ever go looking for my
heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own back
yard because, if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin
with.''

<TEXT>
   Supermarket shoppers, unsure what
distinguishes ``lite'' bread from regular or ``high-fiber'' cereals
from others, may be getting some help from the federal government.
   Both Congress and the Food and Drug Administration are
considering massive revisions in the FDA's nutrition labeling
requirements, which date from 1973, when the vitamin and mineral
content of foods was consumers' prime concern.
   Now, much of the focus of healthy eating has shifted to foods'
cholesterol, fat and fiber content _ areas untouched by the current
regulations.
   Even the food industry, until now a foe of compulsory labeling,
appears to be going along _ for a price.
   Says Dr. Frank Young, the FDA commissioner:
   ``The public is demanding change in this area and deserves
nothing less than our maximum efforts to accomplish this change.''
   Young, testifying before a congressional committee recently,
referred to the two biggest driving forces behind the heightened
interest in nutrition _ the Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition
and Health, which cited dietary factors in five of the 10 leading
causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, and
the report by the National Research Council, ``Diet and Health:
Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk.''
   The FDA commissioner said both reports, issued last year,
``concluded that Americans could substantially reduce their risk of
heart disease, cancer and many other chronic diseases through
specific changes in eating habits.''
   A survey of shoppers taken this year for a food industry
organization found that 94 percent of the poll's participants are
concerned about the nutritional content of what they eat.
Thirty-eight percent said they were most concerned about
cholestrol, a 16-point jump in just one year.
   But the FDA and members of Congress disagree on how to give the
public what it wants.
   Since 1973, when the FDA imposed nutrition labeling requirements
for the first time, products to which nutrients have been added or
for which a nutrition claim is made:
   _Must be labeled with quantitative listings of calories,
carbohydrates and protein.
   _Must show, by ``average'' or ``usual'' serving, the percentages
of the federal government's recommended daily allowance of protein,
vitamin A, vitamin C, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium and
iron contained in a product.
   _Must list calories, protein content, carbohydrates, fat and
sodium.
   But those regulations were drawn up when vitamin and mineral
content was the most prevalent consumer concern.
   Now, what many shoppers want most is such information as a
product's fat and fiber content, its ``liteness'' _ or lack thereof
_ and how ``naturally'' it was made.
   Some in Congress contend the FDA has not moved quickly enough to
address those concerns.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
have introduced the ``Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of
1989.'' If passed by both houses, the bill's sponsors say revised
labels could begin appearing within 18 months of being signed by
the president.
   Twenty-three groups, including the American Heart Association
and American Cancer Society, have endorsed the bill.
   The legislation would require that labels list the serving size
and number of servings per container; total calories, and calories
broken down by total and saturated fat. Also required would be
amounts, broken down by serving, of total, saturated and
unsaturated fat; cholesterol; sodium; complex carbohydrates;
protein; dietary fiber, and other nutrients.
   The bill would also require that any health claims on labels
that characterize the amount or relationship of calories, fat,
cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, sugar, protein or dietary fiber
to a disease or condition use terms defined by the secretary of
health and human services and that the definitions be supported by
a scientific consensus.
   Another bill, introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is similar
to the Waxman-Metzenbaum bill except that it would preclude state
labeling regulations.
   Perceptions of the two proposals vary predictably.
   The FDA says congressional action isn't necessary, that it can
meet shoppers' needs without legislation. The grocery industry
supports the Hatch bill. Activist consumer groups say any
legislation that is adopted will need to address a variety of
nutrition issues not now covered.
   For its part, the FDA plans to hold five hearings around the
country to ask people how they would like to see the current
regulations changed.
   For instance, the agency wants to know how much interest there
is in writing definitions for commonly used terms, such as ``low
salt'' or ``reduced fat;'' whether there should be requirements
manufacturers must meet in claiming their products help prevent
disease; if minimum standards are needed to identify certain foods,
and whether the public is willing to pay the added costs that would
likely accompany new labeling requirements.
   From the comments at those hearings, which haven't been set, the
FDA says it will revise its regulations and that the process should
be finished early in 1990.
   The agency's intent is to convince Congress it need not set the
FDA's standards, or at least to have revised regulations ready if
Capitol Hill orders the agency to change its act.
   Young told Congress:
   ``It is unclear whether legislation is necessary to achieve most
or all of our shared goals. I believe many, if not all, of the
changes contemplated can be made administratively.''
   The food industry's primary hope appears to be getting federal
legislation that eliminates state regulation.
   Says Jeff Nedelman, a vice president of the Grocery
Manufacturers of America:
   ``We would support a comprehensive reform of the dietary and
health informaton that is provided to consumers if we can come out
of this process with national standards.''
   Seeking to avoid potentially 50 different state standards, the
National Food Processors Association says regulations ``appropriate
for Portland, Maine, are equally applicable to Portland, Ore.''
   But some consumer groups say states should still have the
prerogative to toughen federal standards and note that California
and New York, for instance, have often taken the lead in nutrition
issues.
   Whatever the new regulations are, these activists say they need
to reflect a range of specific consumer interests not now addressed
in the FDA requirements.
   One group in the forefront of the movement to toughen labeling
requirements, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says
the regulations should:
   _Eliminate or supplement the description of quantities as
measured in ``grams,'' a metric term, unless accompanied by defined
terms such as high, low or medium.
   _Eliminate thiamin, riboflavin and niacin from labels, since
deficiencies in those elements are no longer a significant health
threat.
   _List amounts of fat, cholesterol, ``cholesterol-raising'' or
saturated fats, sodium, starch, dietary fiber and sugar.
   _Consider a diagram giving percentages of protein, sugar,
complex carbohydrates, total fat and saturated fat.
   _List the percentage of a product's major ingredients, such as
sugar and flour.

<TEXT>
   Ruined medieval fortresses stand
silhouetted against the sky on scorched mountaintops across Soviet
Georgia and atop each one flies a flag of the Georgian independence
movement.
   The flags fly as well on police outposts and are sold at Tbilisi
newsstands in the form of lapel pins and dashboard suction cups.
One hangs over a highway from a peasant's plot,
   This land of glaciered crags, fruit-filled valleys and Black Sea
beaches is seething with resentment against the ``invaders'' from
Russia who took over their infant republic in 1921.
   Since troops armed with sharp shovels and toxic gas clashed with
pro-independence protesters in this capital April 9, killing 19 of
them, sympathy has grown for those Georgians who want to secede
from the Soviet Union.
   But the Soviet Socialist Republic of Georgia _ a kingdom on its
own in the Middle Ages _ also is rent by ethnic violence, much of
it pitting Christian Georgians against Moslem minorities.
   It is an explosive combination on the heels of April 9.
   ``This is the last thing Georgia needs right now,'' says Gizo
Grzeledze, an official in the Georgian Foreign Ministry. ``It will
bring the troops back.''
   The ethnic violence is spawned in part by reaction to the
Georgians' rising nationalism.
   Hatreds and resentments dating back to the medieval times have
reappeared among the dozen nationalities in the republic, which is
about half the size of Arkansas.
   Conflicts pitting Georgians against Moslem Abkhazians and
Azerbaijanis have cost 26 lives and injured more than 450 in
several areas of Georgia since the summer began. Georgians in the
Meskhetian area guard their homes against ethnic Turks living there.
   At the same time, independence activists persuaded tens of
thousands of workers to walk off their jobs in a general strike,
crippling transport and even a military jet factory.
   Thousands more have gathered in daily illegal meetings in
downtown Tbilisi.
   Even officials in the government ministry across the street from
the gathering were hanging out their windows one recent day to
listen to activist Sviad Gamsachurdia, who said that in 1976 he
could count just 20 or 30 people willing to join his call for
independence.
   In a Tbilisi suburb, vandals smashed the face and tore the head
off a statue of Vladimir I. Lenin, the revered founder of the
Soviet Union, while a statue of the dictator Josef V. Stalin, a
Georgian, stands unscathed.
   The combustible mixture of nationalist unrest and ethnic
violence is risky not only for Georgia but also the rest of the
country, said Shalva Shanidze, Communist Party leader of the
Akhaltsike region in the Meskhetian area.
   By strengthening the hard-liners, he maintained, the activists
are endangering all of the Soviet Union and its moves toward
democracy and economic autonomy. More than 100 ethnic groups live
in the 15 Soviet republics.
   But Gamsachurdia, a grey-haired veteran of Georgia's resistance
to Soviet power, says he is concerned only with the fate of
Georgia, not the Soviet Union; the fate of Georgia, he maintains,
is threatened by what he sees as Islamic fundamentalism spilling
over the border from Iran.
   It is a measure of the Georgian public's sharing in
Gamsachurdia's belief that the question activists and Georgian
Communist officials alike pose to a visitor is not whether the
United States would help Georgia break from Moscow but whether it
would help an independent, Christian Georgia against Islamic
fundamentalist Iran.
   The independence demonstrations of April have turned into
demonstrations involving ethnic differences and religious
backgrounds.
   The Christian Orthodox Church remains deeply rooted among
Georgians and still commands respect, although the Soviet
government fosters atheism. A number of very old churches have been
preserved in Georgia.
   Conflict between Christians and Moslems goes back centuries in
the Soviet Caucasus region, particularly in Georgia and neighboring
Soviet Armenia.
   Thousands of Georgians filled Rustaveli Ave. in Tbilisi daily
demonstrations during recent ethnic rioting between Georgians and
Moslems in the Abkhazian region, a Black Sea resort area.
   Commanders of the 4,500 Soviet troops sent to quell the rioting
said there were attempts to provoke the troops into firing on the
population in what would have been a horrifying repeat of April 9
in Tblisi.
   A letter from the Georgian National Front to the United Nations
in New York charged that the violence in Abkhazia was organized by
Moscow. It asked for U.N. troops because, it claimed, Soviet troops
were protecting only Abkhazians, not Georgians.
   Col. Gen. Yuri Shatalin of the Soviet army said his troops
confiscated thousands of weapons from both Georgians and
Abkhazians, including explosives and machine guns.
   Lovard Tukhashvili of the Georgian Institute of History,
Archeology and Ethnography said he believes the rioting was
instigated by Abkhazians who stand to lose their privileges to
Gorbachev's reforms or to an independent Georgia.
   Abkhazians number 80,000, just 17 percent of the Abkhazian
autonomous republic's population and 1.5 percent of Georgia's 5.3
million people, but they dominate the power structure and
managerial jobs in their region, Tukhashvili said.
   The Abkhazians contend, however, they are struggling for equal
rights and feel they will achieve them only by seceding from
Georgia and becoming a 16th republic of the Soviet Union, according
to Abkhazian legislator Vladislav Ardzinba.
   Minorities in Georgia are reacting to growing Georgian
nationalism, inextricably woven into the independence movement,
Ardzinba said.
   But Georgians tell outsiders that this is Georgian land.
Abkhazians, Azerbaijanis and Meskhetian Turks make equally detailed
claims to the contrary.
   Georgia was a kingdom from the 4th century B.C. to the 14th
century A.D. In 1555, western Georgia fell to Turkey and eastern
Georgia to Persia, now Iran. It became part of the Russian Empire
in 1783 and had a spell of independence in 1918-21, after the
Bolsheviks seized power in Moscow.
   Because Georgians resisted the new Soviet power, a quarter of
their land was turned over to other ethnic groups.
   Tukhashvili, the historian, said Stalin did his fellow Georgians
no favors when he had whole nationalities deported from traditional
homelands to Central Asia.
   For example, he said, the Georgians who moved onto the lands of
the deported Meskhetian Turks now face nearly 400,000 Meskhetians
clamoring to return and reclaim their homes.
   For Grzeledze of the Georgian Foreign Ministry, it is no
coincidence that the Azerbaijanis, Turks and most of the Abkhazians
are Moslems, traditional enemies of Christian Georgia.
   Georgia voluntarily joined the Russian Empire because it was the
only Christian alternative to domination by Turks and Persians.
   Nearly two centuries have passed, but the geography hasn't
changed.
   Persia is now revolutionary Iran, under the rule of Moslem
mullahs dedicated to spreading Islamic fundamentalism, and the high
birth rates of Moslems have the Georgians fearful of becoming
minorities in their own land.

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi is giving his
revolution a facelift, repainting the weathered look of the radical
Arab nation that has not aged gracefully.
   The revolution turns 20 on Sept. 1 and the colonel, at a cost
estimated to total hundreds of millions of dollars, is preparing an
anniversary bash in a remodeled capital.
   However, Western diplomats say the fresh paint can't hide all
the cracks in Gadhafi's Libya. They said violent unrest in the
military around Benghazi in January killed an unknown number of
people and injured more than 100.
   Moslem fundamentalists demonstrated against Gadhafi in Tripoli
also in January and some were sent to jail. The diplomats estimate
Gadhafi's prisons now hold 2,000 to 6,000 people _ perhaps more
than when he bulldozed down the prison gates in March of 1988 in a
general amnesty.
   Oil profits are diminishing and some fields could dry up in 10
years. Diplomats conservatively estimate Libya earns $5 billion a
year and spends $7 billion to $8 billion.
   The 3{-year-old U.S. embargo on dealings with Libya, imposed by
President Ronald Reagan and recently renewed by President Bush, is
hurting. If Libya doesn't gain access to American spare parts soon,
experts say many of the oil plants will have to be replaced
entirely.
   Still, two decades after he seized power from King Idris,
Gadhafi remains solidly in control, said the diplomats, who all
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``He is very strong,'' a European ambassador said. ``That is why
he is having the 20th anniversary. There is no one to replace him
and he sees to that. He will not let anyone else have enough power
to become a threat.''
   As Sept. 1 approaches, the clean-up continues around the clock.
Thousands of workers are repaving Tripoli's old streets and
building new ones. A luxury hotel and new office towers rise along
the waterfront. Scores of new mosques and apartment buildings are
under construction.
   Everywhere painters are covering the dirty brown face of Tripoli
with fresh coats of white paint trimmed with green, the color of
Gadhafi's revolution.
   Behind the whitewash and beyond the smooth new roads are grim,
run-down apartments on littered streets. The shops and apartments
in the narrow alleys of the Arab market and the old quarter are
filthy and rat infested. Trash and garbage are crammed into
alcoves, beneath stairs and piled high in vacant lots.
   There is no open government in Libya and changes are hard to
quantify. Requests for interviews with Gadhafi or the heads of
Libyan ministries went unanswered. Many of the officials were in
Sirte, a coastal city 155 miles southeast of Tripoli, where Gadhafi
reportedly is building a new capital.
   Diplomats say the military presence appears reduced in recent
months and troops no longer patrol the airport.
   But surface-to-air missile batteries and radar stations still
are seen in Tripoli. Anti-aircraft guns jut above the now gleaming
white walls of Gadhafi's fortified compound.
   The weapons are a reminder of the U.S. air raids on Tripoli and
Benghazi in April, 1986, ordered by President Reagan in retaliation
for the terrorist bombing of a disco in West Berlin that killed an
American serviceman and a Turkish woman.
   During the last year, Western diplomats said, Gadhafi has sought
to reduce tensions with the West, mend fences with the Arab world
and loosen his stranglehold on Libyan commerce.
   He has restored ties with Egypt and opened oil negotiations with
the Americans for the possible return of U.S. oil companies to
Libya, hinting he is also ready to improve relations. American oil
companies had oil concessions in Libya worth an estimated $3
billion when Reagan ordered the embargo on Feb. 1, 1986. Oil
companies were given until June 30, 1986, to comply. Reagan's order
banned Americans from visiting or working in Libya.
   U.S. relations with Libya have been sour almost since he seized
power. The U.S. Wheelus air base in Libya was evacuated in June,
1970, and the U.S. ambassador was recalled in 1973. The U.S.
embassy was sacked Dec. 2, 1979, by radicals in support of the
Iranian revolution, and the last two American diplomats were
removed in May, 1980. In May 1981, the United States closed the
Libyan mission in Washington. U.S. interests are currently
represented by the Belgian embassy.
   Reagan ordered the embargo in 1986 because of terrorists attacks
at the Rome and Vienna airports in December 1985. The United States
blamed Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal for the attacks and accused
Ghadhafi of harboring him.

   The Western diplomats, some citing Palestinian sources, say
there are reports that Gadhafi has stopped giving money to terror
groups such as Abu Nidal's, most likely because of their ties to
Moslem fundamentalism.
   But the diplomats add that there are other unconfirmed reports
that guerrilla training bases still operate in the Libyan desert.
   The diplomats say they have heard reports that the alleged
chemical weapons plant at Rabta, 60 miles southwest of Tripoli, has
been dismantled. But they caution it could be rebuilt later.
   Last December, President Reagan said he could not rule out a
military strike to destroy the plant that Gadhafi insisted was
designed to manufacture pharmaceuticals. The tensions over the
plant escalated in January when U.S. warplanes shot down two Libyan
MiGs in the Mediterranean.
   Some Libyans insist their life has improved during the 20 years
of Gadhafi's rule.
   ``Before the people didn't have houses, there were no schools,
no streets,'' said one. ``Now the people have houses, schools and
streets.''
   The Western diplomats said over the years Gadhafi has squandered
billions on arms, military adventure and prestige projects.
   The most obvious changes are in the shops. Gadhafi's socialist
policies had forced most shops to close years ago, leading to
shortages and blackmarket prices. The colonel had all but stopped
imports of consumer goods, allowing only a few to be sold through
giant state companies. In 1985, he expelled thousands of foreign
workers while at the same time his revolutionary system forbade
Libyans from working for other Libyans under most circumstances.
   Last year, Gadhafi began allowing small businesses to import
some goods for sale.
   Now about two-thirds of the shops in the Arab market and central
Tripoli are open. The shelves are stocked with household goods,
jewelry and cheaply made clothes from Malta, Tunisia, Yugolavia,
Romania and Italy.
   Barefoot weavers toil at ancient looms in the old quarter while
other craftsmen etch designs in decorative copper or brass plates.
   Private fruit, vegetable and meat stores are open all over the
city. But the shelves are still barren in the vast,
government-owned People's Markets, which are combination department
stores and supermarkets.
   At noon one recent day the food shelves on one People's Market
store had only bottled fruit drinks, canned fish, processed cheese
from Holland, tea from China, jars of honey, cans of condensed
milk, Turkish detergent and large burlap sacks of sugar.
   Diplomats said the new openness led to price gouging that
prompted the government to close some shops.
   Near Sabatrah, 50 miles west of Tripoli, scores of shops and
storefronts have been reduced to rubble by government bulldozers.
   ``You see it everywhere,'' one diplomat said. ``The official
reason is that the shops were illegal, they did not have the proper
licenses and building permits.''
   But a young Libyan businessman said, ``I think this is a good
idea because it will teach respect for the law.''
   Gadhafi's policies make it difficult, but not impossible, to
have a successful business, said the businessman who used his own
money to start a restaurant and two wholesale food supply
businesses.
   Still he acknowledges that for most people without their own
money there is a sense of hopelessness.
   ``My dream,'' said a young government employee, ``is to go to
America.''

<HEAD>Pell Re-election Campaign Inactive As Schneider Gears Up For Senate
Challenge</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, is acting like a man who doesn't want
to be a senator for six more years.
   While other senators up for re-election next year have already
raised hundreds of thousands _ and in some cases several million _
dollars, Pell's fund-raising activities have been moribund.
   The 31 senators who have established campaign committees for a
1990 re-election bid raised an average of nearly $750,000 each
during the first six months of this year.
   But, according to campaign disclosure reports filed at the
Federal Election Commission, Pell received just a single $5,000
contribution during the same period.
   The numbers are more curious considering the 70-year-old
Democrat is likely to face his toughest race in 18 years.
   Since his hard-fought 1972 victory over Republican John H.
Chafee, who went on to win the state's other Senate seat four years
later, Pell has won re-elections in 1978 and 1984 by 3-to-1 margins
against weak Republican opponents.
   But next year, Pell likely would face Claudine Schneider, an
ambitious and popular five-term congresswoman.
   Miss Schneider, who has all-but-announced a Senate run, reported
more than $200,000 in campaign contributions to her House
re-election committee for the January-June FEC reporting period.
She raised only one-fifth that amount during the corresponding
period two years ago.
   ``When he knows he could face someone as aggressive as Claudine
Schneider, I don't see how he can afford to take that passive
attitude,'' said Wendy DeMocher, a spokeswoman for the National
Republican Senatorial Committee
   Pell aides say the senator's lack of fund raising is not a sign
that he is waffling on whether to run, but an outgrowth of his
concerns that the campaign season has become too long.
   ``He has said repeatedly he has every intention of running,''
said a senior Pell aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``He just feels very strongly that the campaign process has gotten
out of hand.''
   ``He's just practicing what he preaches,'' said Anita Dunn, a
spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
   Pell, however, apparently did not feel that way in previous
elections. In the first six months of 1983, the year before his
last campaign, the senator raised nearly $100,000 in preparation
for a campaign that was considered laughably easy.
   Pell does have $444,686 in his campaign coffers in preparation
for 1990, but 21 of the 30 other senators running next year have
more, according to newly filed FEC documents.
   National GOP campaign strategists, who have virtually ignored
Pell in past races, have targeted the senator as one of the six
incumbent Democrats they will aggressively try to push out of the
Senate next year.
   Pell is one of the most popular politicians in Rhode Island
history, winning his Senate seat in 1960 by defeating two former
governors in a primary and going on to win in 1966, 1972, 1978 and
1984.
   He has been a leading advocate for the arts and education, and
in 1986 he rose to chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
   But chairmen of that committee have in the past suffered at
re-election time, attacked by challengers who charge that they are
paying too much attention to international problems and not enough
to parochial concerns. Five years ago, Democrat Paul Simon
successfully challenged then-Foreign Relations Chairman Charles
Percy, R-Ill.
   Pell is vulnerable in other areas, not least of which is his
preoccupation with psychic powers.
   Miss Schneider could be a formiddable candidate.
   She has broad statewide recognition since Rhode Island has only
two House seats. And she is just the type of Republican that
Democrat-dominated Rhode Island likes _ a liberal on social issues
with a strong environmental record. She came to Congress by the
rarest of routes _ defeating a Democratic incumbent _ and has won
re-election by Pell-like margins ever since.
   The change of administrations at the White House also will help
the congresswoman. While it is questionable how much support she
would have received from conservatives running the party in the
Reagan years, Miss Schneider already has had First Lady Barbara
Bush featured at a lucrative fund-raiser.
   Age also could become a major factor in the race.
   Miss Schneider is 42, the same age Pell was when he first came
to the Senate nearly 30 years ago.
   Pell will be 71 in November and would be 78 at the end of
another six-year term.
   Pell, however, would still be a youngster compared to his
predecessor. Theodore Green came to the Senate at age 69 and
retired in 1960 at age 93.

   Although few in number, South Korean
feminists have mounted an attack on a deeply rooted culture that
encourages women to be dutiful and subservient to their fathers,
husbands and sons.
   The movement has yet to take hold on a broad scale and a major
effort still looms ahead, but the feminists say South Korea no
longer can afford to treat its women as servants and sexual objects.
   They maintain the nation's remarkable economic growth owes much
to women's labors and that the transition from authoritarian to
democratic government will not be complete until women's rights are
assured.
   ``Demand your equal rights,'' reads a headline in the
50,000-circulation Women's News, a weekly.
   Yet, cabarets, barber shops and bars still provide sexual
services to men, and authorities say hundreds, possibly thousands,
of young women are kidnapped each year or forced into prostitution.
   In companies, many male managers make no secret of passing over
women for promotions. Some companies fire women who marry and as
recently as a year ago banks rarely allowed pregnant women to serve
the public.
   When 14 women were appointed last year to head women's
provincial programs, the government called the move a major step
forward. But one appointee said she was shown to her new office
``across from the toilet'' and another contended the government
lumped women, old people and children together ``in order to
dispose of us easily.''
   Women comprise up to 50 percent of the work force and many
thousands of South Korean women have college educations, yet they
still receive half the wages of men, are denied promotions and
often are discriminated against in th courts.
   ``Men are afraid if we have our own identity, our own career,
our own viewpoints, that they are losing something,'' says the only
woman in President Roh Tae-woo's Cabinet, Kim Yung-chung.
   The challenges are formidable and require a change of attitude
in both sexes as well as enforcement of laws, says Chung Il-sook,
president of Ewha, the nation's oldest and largest school for
women, a catalyst in the women's movement. She says change, though
painfully slow, is inevitable.
   Korean feminists concede their movement faces an uphill
struggle. In a nation of 42 million people, only a few thousand are
actively lobbying for women's rights.
   Advocates hope, however, that the establishment of local
assemblies in 1990 will be a turning point to lure women into
politics and they see potential allies in more than 2,500 women's
organizations around the country.
   Paek Young-ok, an Ewha professor, says Korean women need to be
given the opportunity to participate in the political process to
ensure that women play a permanent and far-reaching role in
government and laws affecting their lives.
   ``Fully one-half of the entire adult population have been all
but invisible in political terms,'' she says. Paek blames this on
sex-role conceptions and the limitations of political opportunity.
   A 1988 equal employment act guarantees employment opportunities
for women and the employment security act calls for increasing the
options for women's work. But feminists say that without
enforcement, the words are window dressing.
   ``The provisions are perfect,'' said Kim, the Cabinet member who
oversees policy for women. ``But our job is to narrow the gap
between legal provisions and practices ... to fully implement the
provisions.''
   The first woman to run for president, Hong Suk-ja, became so
exasperated that she told a news conference two years ago, ``I am
prepared to do everything humanly possible but strip tease to help
emancipate Korean women.''
   In nearby Japan, a record 22 women were elected recently to the
upper house of Parliament, an event cheered by Korean feminists,
who failed to elect one woman to the last National Assembly in
Seoul.
   Networking among Korean professional women has taken root with
breakfast and luncheon clubs. Women can attend training courses to
prepare for politics or business, and telephone hotline numbers are
available for women in need. Concerts of women composers and
women's cinema festivals now are being held.
   Yet many women show no sign of joining the struggle. It's common
for a wife to stay in the kitchen when a family entertains or, if
she's at the table, not to speak in deference to her husband. Even
radical students demanding sweeping change ignore women's rights
and treat women as cheerleaders instead of policy makers.
   ``Some say I'm a feminist,'' President Roh said at a news
conference. ``I got a lot of votes from women in my last election.''
   But his wife, Kim Ok-sook, remains dutifully in his shadow,
usually appearing in public walking behind him and rarely speaking
to the press.

   The head of the leading opposition party, Kim Dae-jung, came
under attack after his wife, Lee Hee-ho, gave speeches in the last
presidential campaign.
   ``Democracy begins at home,'' she said one speech, urging South
Koreans not to discriminate between male and female children.
   A door plaque at Kim's residence lists his wife's name alongside
his, a rarity and a source of disdain among some of their neighbors.
   Surveys indicate that despite growing sensitivity to women's
expanding roles in society, both sexes expect women to remain
subservient and both consider lower wages for women ``natural.''
   The government says 45 to 50 percent of the 20 million-member
work force are women, half in unskilled or semi-skilled
manufacturing and assembly-line jobs.
   Feminists charge that women face discrimination at every level.
They note that only nine of the country's 1,798 lawyers and 24 of
the 1,008 judges are women.
   The government-run Korean Women's Development Institute,
established in 1983, says the deeply rooted, male-oriented
mentality of Korean culture has led to most women feeling inferior
to men, an attitude it says prolongs discrimination.
   Acceptance of women's second-class role is linked to the
500-year-old teachings of Confucius, who stressed the role of men
and felt that the woman's place was to serve, to obey her husband
and bear him a son.
   ``Women are never to ask questions but are supposed to do what
men tell them,'' says a businesswoman. ``Women are losing patience,
and the younger the woman, the less patience she has.''
   Traditionally Korean women were identified not by name, but by a
reference relative to the men in their lives.
   They were known as so-and-so's daughter, so-and-so's wife and in
old age, so-and-so's mother. So few people knew their mother's
given name that after the 1950-53 Korean War divided the peninsula,
officials had difficulty uniting families.
   ``The culture is changing,'' said Ewha's Dr. Chung. To
democratize South Korea and continue its economic growth, she said,
the nation needs ``to mobilize its full human resources. Why should
women be restricted?''
   Demands of women's groups include changing family law in which
males benefit more than females in marriage, divorce and
inheritance.
   ``If women of advanced training and high caliber are to be
excluded from our social system for no other reason than that they
are not men, it will be a great loss and a waste of valuable
resources,'' said a recent editorial in the Korea Herald.
   Women labor union leaders say impoverished factory workers are
joining educated women in demanding change. Male managers complain,
as one put it, that women who once ``kept their mouths shut now
scream about hours and wages.''
   Union activist Lee Kyong-ja has a college degree and worked 20
years for the Korea Development Bank. Her efforts to unionize women
at the bank resulted in demotion, a 14-day hunger strike and
dismissal before she was reinstated as a union chief.
   ``Women should learn to complain, negotiate, and fight, no
matter how much time and pain it may take, because it's a long way
that we have to go,'' she said.
   ``Education is the real hope for women's rights,'' says Chang
Pil-wha, head of Ewha's 12-year-old women's studies department, the
first established in Asia. Some 2,000 of Ewha's 17,000 students
take courses each semester in women's issues.
   ``People must recognize women as social beings,'' said Yoon
Seon-young, a college junior. ``We cannot be discriminated against
any longer.''

   Hilton Hotel Corp. put itself up for sale
Thursday, telling its financial advisers to seek buyers for the
whole company or its lodging and gaming divisions.
   The advisers, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Eastdil Realty
Inc., have been surveying the giant hotel-gambling company's
properties since mid-June. They reported on that survey at a board
meeting Thursday, company spokesman William Lebo said.
   Lebo said Beverly Hills-based Hilton would consider selling its
lodging segment and its casino operations in Nevada and Australia
separately.
   ``Management indicated that a package of confidential
information relative to the company will be available in
September,'' the company said in a statement.
   Hilton has been considered a takeover candidate since May 8,
when Barron Hilton settled a long-running dispute over the estate
of his late father, company founder Conrad Hilton, with the Conrad
N. Hilton Foundation.
   The settlement gave Barron Hilton control of about 25 percent of
Hilton stock, and he said May 11 the company would consider serious
buyout bids.
   Lebo said numerous potential buyers had inquired about Hilton,
but declined to elaborate except to say that interest was worldwide.
   ``With a company with a name like ours, you could find buyers
literally anywhere, Hong Kong, Japan,'' he said.
   Hilton stock was trading at $63 per share when the estate
dispute was settled.
   The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading of Hilton stock
when the buyout announcement was made.
   After trading resumed, the stock closed down $3.87{ at $108. The
stock had hit to a 52-week high of $111.87{ Wednesday on reports
that the board was considering at least two formal buyout bids.
   Hilton has about 48 million shares outstanding.
   Hilton owns 12 hotels, including the Waldorf Astoria and the Las
Vegas and Flamingo Hiltons in Nevada, and manages 12 hotels it owns
in partnership with others.
   The company manages 18 hotels in which it has no ownership
interest and franchises about 240 Hilton Inns.
   Hilton also has two Las Vegas casinos, another in Reno, Nev., is
building another in Laughlin, Nev., and has a 10 percent interest
in a hotel-casino in Queensland, Australia.
   The company last year earned $130.9 million on revenue of $915.4
million.

<HEAD>Vitro Aims To Become International Glass Giant</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a $280 million hostile offer for
America's No. 2 glass maker, a leading Mexican manufacturer hopes
to challenge the plastic, paper and other container materials that
have hurt the U.S. glass business.
   In what is believed to be the first hostile takeover bid by a
Mexican company, Vitro SA this week announced a $20-a-share
takeover offer for struggling Anchor Glass Container Corp. of
Tampa, Fla.
   Ulrich Sander, director of corporate communications for Vitro,
said Vitro's plans ``would help strengthen the glass part of the
packaging industry in the United States.''
   ``Vitro wants to bring state-of-the-art technology to Anchor
Glass to make it more competitive and to regain sales lost to
paper, metal and plastic containers,'' he said.
   Like other U.S. glass-container makers, Anchor has struggled as
plastic and aluminum have displaced glass as the packaging material
of choice in many industries in the 1980s.
   New technology has helped glass makers boost production lately
and there has been a slight increase in demand largely because of
the popularity of long-necked beer bottles, analysts said.
   Anchor, second in glass manufacturing to Owens-Illinois Inc.
with about 25 percent of the U.S. market, lost $8.5 million in 1988
on revenue of $977.8 million.
   So far this year Anchor has lost $14.4 million, including $10.3
million in the second quarter compared with profits of $1.8
million, or 13 cents a share, in the same 1988 quarter.
   Anchor manufactures glass containers for the brewing, food, soft
drink, distilled spirits and wine industries. In 1987, it acquired
competitor Diamond-Bathhurst Inc. for nearly $191.3 million.
   Vitro, headquartered in the northern industrial center of
Monterrey, made $152 million last year on revenue of $1.11 billion.
   Vitro made its all-cash offer Wednesday through its indirect
subsidiary THR Corp., which already owns a 10.3 percent stake in
Anchor. Vitro announced simultaneously that Latchford Glass Co. of
Huntington Park, Calif., has agreed to a merger.
   Founded in 1909, Vitro is the leader in Mexican glass
manufacturing. The company makes glass and plastic containers, flat
glass, tableware, household appliances, glass-making machinery and
automotive products, and mines raw materials.
   Vitro is regaining its economic strength after falling into a
severe economic crisis along with the rest of Mexico in 1982. The
company has reduced its debt to $20 million from $758 million in
1982, officials said.
   ``Vitro is already one of the major industrial groups in Mexico.
On an international basis Vitro will be a lot more important if the
operations go through,'' Sander said.
   The hostile bid expires at midnight Sept. 7. Anchor officials
have not responded publicly to the bid and the company declined to
say Thursday whether its board of directors would meet to consider
the offer.
   Vitro on Wednesday filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court trying
to block Anchor from taking any action that would interfere with
its bid.
   Sander said Vitro has ``not received any response at all'' from
Anchor.
   Anchor stock was unchanged at $19.75 Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange after shooting up $7.50, or 61 percent, a day
earlier.
   The merger with Latchford, in which Vitro plans to purchase at
least 90 percent of the company's shares, will be carried out only
if Vitro's purchase of Anchor goes through, Sander said.
   ``Latchford is excited about this opportunity to become part of
a larger organization and better serve our customers,'' Latchford
President Clifford Jones said in a statement.
   Preliminary estimates put total investment costs in both
operations at about $900 million, Sander said. Vitro has said it
would retain Anchor's Tampa headquarters and operating management
but replace top executives.
   Vitro has 37,000 employees, Anchor has 8,700 employees and
Latchford has 700.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico has changed its strict laws regulating
foreign investment in a bid to attract outside investors to its
tourism industry, a Mexican government official says.
   Tourism is Mexico's second-largest source of foreign exchange
after oil and has been identified by the government as the most
promising sector for growth.
   Ezequiel Padilla, Mexico's undersecretary of tourism, said
foreign companies in the past needed permission from a Mexican
government agency before they were allowed to invest in the
country, often with long delays.
   Now, under the 8-month-old administration of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, that process is no longer required, he said.
   ``This is a dramatic change from before,'' Padilla said in an
interview Thursday in New York.
   In addition, foreign investors now can increase holdings in a
Mexican company to a majority stake and profits can be repatriated
abroad.
   Mexico recently reached an agreement with lenders to reduce its
$54 billion debt to commercial banks. The accord is aimed at giving
Mexico $3 billion a year for capital investment.
   Payments on the country's $107 billion foreign debt have
contributed to a sharp decline in living standards over the past
seven years.
   Efforts to encourage foreign investment and lower trade barriers
are considered an integral part of Mexican's new economic plan.
   As an example of recent foreign investment, Padilla cited a $400
million joint venture between Cemex, a large Mexican cement
company, and U.S. hotel giant Marriott Corp. to develop resorts in
five different areas in the next four years.
   Another big U.S. hotel chain, Hyatt Corp., is involved in a
similar venture, Padilla said.
   He said the Mexican government ``will play a very strategic,
catalytical role'' in tourism development by promoting projects and
selling land to investors, with plans to develop five tourist
resorts in Cancun, Ixtapa, Los Cabos, Loreto and Bahias de Huatulco.
   Mexico now earns around $2.5 billion a year from tourism, which
the government hopes to double to $5 billion by 1994. Plans call
for construction of 50,000 hotel rooms, requiring an investment of
about $4 billion.
   About $2 billion of that will come from foreign companies,
including around $1 billion from U.S. sources, Padilla said. The
new tourism program is expected to create around 1 million jobs in
Mexico, where one out of every seven people is employed in that
industry.
   Some 85 percent of the foreign tourists who visit Mexico are
from the United States, each spending an average $500 per week in
the country.

<TEXT>
   Despite political turmoil, Japan Inc. is going full
steam ahead.
   The governing party this week installed its third prime minister
in three months after its worst election defeat in decades, but
Japan's economy is booming and corporate profits are reaching new
highs.
   Japanese business leaders, who are pouring more investment into
factories at home and abroad, welcomed the new prime minister,
Toshiki Kaifu, as they did the last one just 69 days earlier.
   ``We hope he will carry out the political reforms which people
are expecting,'' said steel magnate Eishiro Saito, head of Japan's
biggest association of industrialists.
   Local media for months have criticized the sex and money
scandals of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party as politics
unworthy of a great economic power.
   But some observers say the contrast between Japan's lean, mean
private enterprises and its swampy politics shows that the country
can run itself well despite a vacuum in political leadership.
   ``The impact of recent political problems on the economy has
been quite small,'' said Hiroshi Uchida, senior analyst at First
Boston (Japan) Ltd. ``In this country, economic fundamentals are
much more important than who becomes prime minister.''
   In an editorial today, the Japan Times dismissed the LDP's
recent internal turmoil as ``a sort of tempest in a teacup or a
political burlesque.''
   For more than three decades the conservative Liberal Democratic
Party has been the faithful partner of the bureaucracy and of big
business in creating Japan's famed economic growth and social and
political stability.
   The bureaucracy gave the system brains, business provided the
brawn and the LDP contributed consensus-building and political
legitimacy.
   An influence-peddling scandal growing out of those close ties
has seriously damaged the LDP and virtually paralyzed Parliament
for more than a year, but the private sector is charging ahead with
new investment. Economic coordination at the bureaucratic level
proceeds largely as usual.
   Analysts said that isn't surprising because in Japan career
bureaucrats, not politicians, draft most laws and develop and
implement policies.
   Also, huge companies like Toyota are so rich they don't even
need bank loans, analysts said, and have long outgrown a need to
rely on the government.
   Many Japanese businessmen don't even seem to fear the prospect
of a Socialist government, which could emerge through a coalition
government after lower house elections due by next summer. Some
even said it would teach the LDP a useful lesson.
   ``I don't get a sense of high anxiety'' about a Socialist
government, said Japanese business expert James Abegglen. ``Nothing
they put forward is particularly alarming.''
   ``You have to remember the Socialist Party of Japan is to the
right of many right-wing parties in other countries,'' said Chris
Russell, head of equity analysis at Jardine Fleming (Securities)
Japan. ``The policies of a Socialist government wouldn't be that
dramatically different from the LDP.''
   The Socialists don't advocate nationalizing industries or
sweeping redistribution of income, and would have trouble moving
the entrenched bureaucracy toward radical change even if they
wanted to, he said.
   There are some concerns a victory by the protection-minded
Socialists could worsen trade friction with the United States, and
political uncertainty has dampened stock market activity for months.
   But the stock market surprised analysts by jumping up, not down,
after each major setback for the pro-business Liberal Democratic
Party.
   When Noboru Takeshita resigned in disgrace and when a major
parliamentary defeat forced his successor Sousuke Uno to step down
in rapid succession, the market shot up.
   Market analysts say investors were relieved of uncertainty and
reassured that business could go on as usual. When it comes to the
stock market, Russell said, ``politics is a non-issue.''

<HEAD>BAT Battle: 200 Congressmen `Concerned;' Goldsmith `Shocked'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Master takeover engineer Sir James Goldsmith
is charging that Congressional concern over his hostile bid for BAT
Industries PLC has been whipped up by ``a powerful multinational
tobacco conglomerate.''
   On Thursday it was disclosed that 209 members of the House and
Senate had written Secretary of State James A. Baker III asking him
to express their concern to the British government about the $21.6
billion leveraged buyout.
   State Department officials on two occasions have conveyed
concern to the British Embassy in Washington about the potential
impact of the takeover, The New York Times reported in today's
editions.
   Responding to the congressmen's letter, Goldsmith said in a
statement: ``Had any of them checked they would have easily
ascertained that the so-called `facts' alluded to in the letter are
innaccurate and misleading.''
   Last month, the Anglo-French financier combined with British
merchant banker Jacob Rothschild and Australian investor Kerry
Packer to make an offer for BAT.
   The cashless offer by Hoylake Investments Ltd. would be financed
mostly with borrowed money.
   BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, also has significant
interests in financial services, paper and retailing _ including
such U.S. holdings as the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field
department stores and Farmers Insurance Group.
   ``This proposed deal looks like takeover mania at its worst,''
said Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., whose office released the letter to
Baker along with Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
   But Goldsmith, who has made millions taking over companies and
then selling off their pieces, said the congressmen didn't have
their facts straight.
   ``I am shocked that 200 people would sign a letter attacking us
without a single one of those people checking with us as to its
accuracy or validity,'' said Goldsmith in the statement issued in
New York.
   ``I can only conclude that this is the result of an intensive
lobbying campaign by a powerful multinational tobacco
conglomerate,'' he added, without elaborating.
   London-based BAT once was known as British American Tobacco.
   Tobacco brands overseen by BAT's U.S. subsidiary, Louisville,
Ky.-based BATUS Inc., include Benson and Hedges and Kool. BATUS
maintains factories, stores or offices in 40 states.
   The letter to Baker said the congressmen were ``deeply
concerned'' about the bid which they said would eventually
``dismantle a company that is important to hundreds of U.S.
communities.''
   But Goldsmith countered: ``Our history of acquisitions in the
United States demonstrates that this has resulted in job-creation
and not job loss.''
   ``The offer makes clear that steps have been taken adequately to
protect U.S. interests, be it those of employees, creditors or
policy-holders,'' said the statement.
   The two Kentucky senators, Ford and McConnell, wrote the letter
on the Senate side. Its authors in the House were Reps. Vic Fazio,
D-Calif.; Michael G. Oxley, R-Ohio; Lindsay Thomas, D-Ga., and Jim
Bunning, R-Ky.
   ``We want you to communicate our concerns to the British
government and we request that you advise us of the steps being
undertaken by the U.S. government to adress the profound policy
implications raised by this egregious deal,'' the letter said.
   The congressionl letter said BAT's U.S. subsidiary, ``its 55,000
employees and millions of insurance policy holders are being put at
considerable risk in a deal that will personally net Goldsmith,
Rothschild, Packer and their advisers over $5 billion.''
   Ford said the offer may be structured to avoid potential
jurisdiction of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and
deny American shareholders a voice in the deal.
   Previously, Ford asked the General Accounting Office to
investigate the potential effects and implications of the BAT offer
on U.S. investors and capital markets and also analyze whether it
would be appropriate for the SEC to assert jurisdiction.
   Several other congressmen have asked SEC Chairman David Ruder to
study the proposed takeover.

   There's no evidence to warrant grounding
DC-10s despite two explosive engine failures within a month, the
nation's top aviation official says.
   ``It's safe to fly. I would fly in the aircraft today,'' Federal
Aviation Administrator James B. Busey said Thursday, less than 24
hours after a Northwest Airlines DC-10 made a safe emergency
landing in Denver with holes blasted in the housing of its
tail-mounted engine.
   For the second time in his first six weeks on the job, Busey
defended the McDonnell Douglas-built DC-10, a workhorse jumbo jet
for about 50 airlines around the world.
   Three weeks ago, another explosive engine failure caused a
United Airlines DC-10 to crash-land in Sioux City, Iowa, killing
111 people.
   ``We know of no hard facts that would lead us to take action to
ground the DC-10,'' Busey said when asked about its safety.
   He declined to draw comparisons between the Sioux City and
Denver incidents, saying any decision to ground a class of
airliners would be made only after careful investigation and
deliberation.
   ``To act speculatively or on the basis of incomplete information
in my judgment would be irresponsible,'' he said.
   The United plane carried General Electric engines, while the
Northwest plane had Pratt and Whitney engines.
   American, Continental, Delta, Eastern, Northwest, Pan American
and United Airlines fly a total of 166 DC-10s, and about 300 more
are flown by non-U.S. airlines.
   After Busey's statements, the International Airline Passengers
Association renewed its call for grounding the DC-10, saying it's
the only way to protect the public while finding out what's wrong
with the aircraft.
   Busey said the FAA was prepared to take any action that might be
indicated by facts uncovered in the National Transportation Safety
Board investigation of the Denver incident and the Iowa crash.
   Investigators said the United jetliner's rear engine apparently
disintegrated in flight, knocking out critical hydraulic flight
controls that meet in the plane's tail section. The Northwest
plane's controls were not affected.
   All DC-10s were grounded for a month in 1979 after an American
Airlines plane lost a wing engine, severing hydraulic lines, as the
plane was taking off from Chicago. Investigators later blamed the
crash on faulty maintenance. A total of 273 people died, including
all 271 on board the plane and two on the ground.
   The NTSB dispatched a full team to Denver because of apparent
similarities with the Sioux City crash. Ordinarily, non-fatal
accidents are handled by NTSB field investigators.
   Both mishaps involved an ``uncontained engine failure,'' in
which engine pieces fly out through the engine casing.
   Meanwhile, a task force formed by Busey last month after the
Sioux City crash to examine possible changes in the design of
wide-body planes met for the first time Thursday.
   The FAA said the task force would compare construction of the
four wide-body planes _ the DC-10, the 747, the L-1011 and the
European-made Airbus _ to determine whether hydraulic systems can
be better protected from engine failures. Hydraulic lines control
the wing and tail mechanisms that steer planes.
   Busey declined to say how long it would take for any changes to
be made, but said he wanted the task force to complete its work and
make recommendations as quickly as possible.
   On other aviation issues, Busey said:
   _A device capable of detecting plastic explosives in luggage is
expected to be in operation at New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport next month, with others to be installed in
London, Frankfurt, West Germany, Miami and San Francisco within a
few months.
   _Reports of ``near midair collisions,'' defined by the FAA as a
separation of less than 500 feet between planes when there is a
danger of collision, received from pilots of all types of planes
totaled 280 for the first six months of 1989, down 25 percent from
the same period last year. There were seven collisions from January
through June, compared with 12 a year ago.
   _Air traffic controller errors and pilot deviations are down
this year. Busey credited improved educational, regulatory and
enforcement measures. Controller errors, he said, fell 8 percent,
from 509 to 469, while pilot deviations declined 30 percent, from
1,580 to 1,104.

<HEAD>Jacobs and Avon Talk About Company's Business Outlook</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Irwin L. Jacobs, who has made a bid of
about $2.85 billion for Avon Products Inc., has had a meeting with
the chairman of the big cosmetics company but a possible sale of
Avon wasn't on the agenda.
   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer,
talked about the company's business plans with Jacobs for about 1{
hours during a meeting Thursday at Avon's New York headquarters,
Avon spokesman John Cox said.
   Cox described the meeting as ``amicable.'' The two men met
alone, without financial advisers or other assistants, Cox said.
   ``The two men had a full and complete discussion of Avon's
recently announced business plans,'' Avon said in a news release
issued after the meeting. ``As agreed to before the meeting, there
were no discussions about the sale of the company.''
   Jacobs, who oversees his holdings from a base in Minneapolis,
wasn't immediately available for comment.
   Earlier this week, Jacobs said he was evaluating what
alternatives he has in his pursuit of Avon. Avon's board on Aug. 3
rejected Jacobs' proposed $41-a-share bid.
   A document submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission
and made public Tuesday said Jacobs would continue to ``evaluate
his alternatives with respect to the company.'' Jacobs' bid would
be worth about $2.85 billion, if he redeemed Avon's preferred
shares as well as buying the company's nearly 55 million shares of
common stock.
   ``Among the factors to be considered in such evaluation will be
that which transpires at or arising from any meetings with
representatives of the company,'' Jacobs' SEC filing said.
   In a letter to Jacobs to inform him that the Avon board rejected
the offer, Preston had said he would agree to meet with Jacobs to
discuss the company's business plans ``but not to negotiate the
sale of the company.''
   Jacobs, in a partnership with Amway Corp., holds about 10.3
percent of Avon's common stock outstanding. Jacobs has said that he
was acting on his own _ without Amway _ in making the attempt to
get control of Avon.
   Avon, the world's biggest direct sales company and a major
beauty products concern, has fended off other suitors recently and
has taken steps to speed its financial turnaround.
   In May, Avon rejected a $39-a-share, or $2.1 billion, takeover
offer from direct-sales rival Amway. It also brushed off advances
from Mary Kay Corp., parent of door-to-door makeup seller Mary Kay
Cosmetics.
   The company has been in the process of selling off its health
care services operations to concentrate on its core beauty and
personal care products business.

<HEAD>L.J. Hooker Gets Line of Credit to Help in Reorganization</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lower-case ``biggs'' is correct.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   L.J. Hooker Corp.'s reorganization under federal
bankruptcy laws and an influx of credit should keep the company's
stores stocked and projects afloat, the new manager of the company
says.
   Officials of General Electric Capital Corp. said Thursday a
proposed $50 million ``debtor-in-possession'' credit line was
intended to help Hooker get back on its feet. The proposal is
subject to approval by the U.S. bankruptcy court.
   L.J. Hooker, the Atlanta-based U.S. subsidiary of Australia's
Hooker Corp., filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code in New York on Wednesday.
   The borrowing under GE Capital's proposed line of credit is to
be secured by certain assets of L.J. Hooker, including inventories
of the Bonwit Teller and B. Altman &amp; Co. store chains, said Jeffery
H. Coates, senior vice president of G.E. Capital's Corporate
Finance Group.
   Meanwhile, vendors reportedly are balking at selling merchandise
to Bonwit Teller and Altman's due to the parent company's financial
difficulties.
   The Wall Street Journal reported today that several vendors have
said they will sell merchandise only on a cash basis to the two
department store chains.
   Sanford C. Sigoloff, a turnaround expert, who has been hired by
L.J. Hooker to manage the company during reorganization, told the
Journal that the reaction of vendors isn't surprising.
   ``There's nothing strange about the vendor reaction, because
this company hasn't been the best corporate citizen in terms of
payment,'' he said. ``Our job is to essentially work with the
trade, give them cash before delivery, and then develop a
relationship that allows them to give us trade credit.''
   Coates said the presence of Sigoloff played a role in the
decision by G.E. Capital to extend the credit line. GE Capital is a
subsidiary of General Electric Co.
   ``It is a time to take the pressure out of the pressure
cooker,'' Sigoloff said in an interview with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. ``We have to jump-start this company, which
has been starved for cash. Now the test is who gets the cash and
how much.''
   He said the priority would be to L.J. Hooker's ``customers,''
those who have bought L.J. Hooker homes and who shop in the
company's department stores. ``We are going to clean the slate and
get going again,'' he said.
   Sigoloff, who will meet with Hooker creditors later this month,
has rehabilitated several financially troubled companies, including
Wickes Companies Inc., a California-based retailer that also was in
Chapter 11.
   While some of L.J. Hooker's holdings were not included in the
bankruptcy filing, analysts said that might be because they already
are in negotiations with potential purchasers.
   Anthony McLellan, a former president of L.J. Hooker who is
trying to purchase the L.J. Hooker homes division, said, ``I
understand that (Sigoloff) is interested in disposing of the
assets.''
   ``I expect he'll be interested in meeting people who are
interested buying,'' said McLellan.
   Meanwhile Thursday, the anchor store of Thornton Town Center, an
L.J. Hooker mall development in Denver, said it would open as
scheduled next month despite the company's financial problems.
   In Denver, bigg's, called Colorado's first ``hypermarket,''
announced its scheduled Sept. 20 opening at Thornton Town Center
would not be affected by the L.J. Hooker filing.
   L.J. Hooker is the mall's main developer, and bigg's is slated
to be the 700,000-square foot shopping center's main tenant.
   Pierre Weaver, executive vice president of Hyper Shoppes,
bigg's' parent company, said the store can be successful regardless
of the mall's fate.
   L.J. Hooker has subsidiaries in the development and retail
markets. In a statement Wednesday, Sigoloff said the bankruptcy
filing, which includes L.J. Hooker Homes, will allow the company to
restructure and repay debts, which total about $1.2 billion.
   Under Chapter 11, a federal court order frees the company from
the threat of creditors' lawsuits until it can develop a plan to
put its finances in order. The reorganization plan must be accepted
by a majority of the creditors.

   The stock market churned ahead in active trading
today, bidding to reach record highs with encouragement from
unexpectedly favorable news on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 12.71 to
2,725.34 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street, surpassing the closing peak of
2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 5 to 3 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 738 up, 422
down and 585 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 74.65 million shares at
midmorning.
   The Dow Jones industrial average made a short-lived run Thursday
afternoon past its peak of two summers ago, but then fell back in
late trading.
   This morning, analysts said buyers drew some fresh inspiration
from evidence that inflationary pressures have eased significantly
as the economy has slowed.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.4 percent in July, posting its biggest
decline in three years. Advance estimates in the financial world
had called for the index to be unchanged or modestly higher.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets after the figures were
reported. Prices of long-term government bonds rose nearly $10 for
each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields just below 8
percent.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Ford Motor rose { to 50|;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph \ to 40\; Exxon { to 44}, and Dow
Chemical { to 98}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.73 to 194.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .06 at 382.18.

<HEAD>Eds: Inserts graf 5, These data, with Fitzwater comment. This also

<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices, driven down by declining
costs for gasoline and new cars, fell 0.4 percent in July for their
biggest decline in three years, the government reported today.
   The drop last month in the Labor Department's Producer Price
Index followed a 0.1 percent dip in June as the wholesale inflation
gauge registered its first back-to-back monthly declines since
early 1986.
   The July improvement was even better than expected and bolstered
the arguments of economists that inflation will be well behaved in
the second half of the year, giving the Federal Reserve more room
to lower interest rates in an effort to keep the economy out of a
recession.
   In more good economic news, the government reported today that
retail sales, bolstered by an upturn in auto spending, shot up 0.9
percent in July, the biggest advance in three months, with
revisions to May and June sales showing significantly more strength
than believed earlier.
   ``These data suggest the economy continues to sustain modest
growth with low inflation. We're on a sound economic course.
Unemployment is the lowest in more than a decade, inflation is
going down, growth is steady'' and the stock market rallying, said
presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We have the best of both worlds, no inflation and increasing
consumer spending,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the
National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. ``Those are very
good vital signs for the economy.''
   The news on inflation was particularly welcome because it came
after a surge in prices earlier in the year had triggered fears
that the country could be on the verge of another inflationary
spiral.
   Even with the back-to-back declines, wholesale inflation through
the first half of 1989 rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent,
compared to last year's 4 percent rise.
   But the acceleration in prices had been caused by higher energy
and food costs. With both areas showing moderation now, economists
are looking for inflation to slow substantially in the last half of
the year.
   The 0.4 percent July drop in wholesale prices reflected the
second monthly drop in gasoline prices, which fell 7.2 percent
after declining 4 percent in June.
   Another favorable price development came from a 1.9 percent
decline in new car prices. Labor Department analysts said this
decrease reflected earlier-than-usual end-of-the-model-year
discounting by automakers trying to clear out a large inventory of
unsold cars.
   Food costs, which had fallen a giant 0.8 percent in June, edged
up by 0.1 percent in July.
   Inflation excluding the food and energy categories fell as well
in July, dropping 0.2 percent. Because food and energy prices vary
widely from month to month, economists look to the inflation rate
of other goods as an indication of underlying inflationary
pressures.
   The slight increase in food costs was attributed to a 2.5
percent rise in beef prices, which had fallen in June.
   Prices also turned up after June declines for fish, pasta, soft
drinks, coffee and rice.
   Fresh fruit prices continued to rise, climbing 1.3 percent in
July after a 1.4 percent jump a month earlier. Vegetable costs,
however, took another big drop, falling 9 percent after an 8
percent June decline.
   The gasoline price decline helped to mask an increase of 1.5
percent in the cost of natural gas and a 0.3 percent rise in home
heating oil costs.
   The overall 0.4 percent July decline in the Producer Price Index
for finished goods one stop short of retail was the biggest
one-month drop since a 0.8 percent fall in July 1986.
   The June-July drops marked the first consecutive monthly
declines since a four-month period of falling wholesale prices from
January through April in 1986.
   The improvement in July left the Producer Price Index at 114.0,
meaning that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 in 1982
would have cost $114.00 last month.
   Economists worried at the beginning of the year that higher food
and energy costs were threatening to become imbedded in permanently
higher inflation rates as workers demanded higher wage increases to
make up for the ground lost to rising prices.
   That was a top concern at the Federal Reserve, which began
moving in March 1988 to push interest rates up in an effort to
dampen inflationary pressures.
   The Fed's goal was to slow economic growth enough to allow
inflation to moderate without pushing the country into a recession.
   In early June of this year, the central bank switched course
from worrying about inflation to worrying about an economic slump
and conducted three modest moves since that time to lower interest
rates.
   Many economists are looking for further credit easing on the
part of the Fed as the economy sends out further signals that
inflation is slowing.
   Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia
State University, said he expected wholesale prices would rise 5.1
percent this year, compared with an increase of 4 percent in 1988.
   However, in the first six months of the year, wholesale prices
were rising at an annual rate of 7.6 percent. Ratajczak said he
expected prices would moderate significantly to an annual rate of
less than 3 percent in the last six months of 1989.

<HEAD>Sears Cuts 104 Jobs at Telemarketing Headquarters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said it will reduce by
nearly half the 250-member workforce at its telemarketing operation
as part of continuing cutbacks in its merchandise group staff.
   Sears, which this week cut jobs in its catalog headquarters,
said Wednesday that 104 of the employees at its suburban Chicago
facility, most of them part time, will be terminated at the
company's credit telemarketing and shop-at-home direct-marketing
services departments by Oct. 6.
   Many of those remaining in the two departments will be part-time
workers, as opposed to full time.
   ``The reason for this reorganization is that their business is
cyclical,'' said a Sears spokeswoman. ``We want better coverage on
the phones, and part-time employees are more suited to that.''
   The credit telemarketing operation, which handles 800-number
credit inquiries and credit solicitation, will move to existing
facilities in Knoxville, Tenn., in October. About 80 jobs in that
department, including those of 20 full-time workers, will be
eliminated.
   In the direct-response department, 24 full-time workers will be
cut, leaving 136 part-time workers behind to handle the job.
   The cuts are all part of Sears' previously announced
wide-ranging restructuring program, which includes reducing its

<UNK>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, `A separate...,' to CORRECT that declines first

   Monetary authorities around the world sold dollars
today as part of a concerted effort to stem a sharp surge in the
U.S. currency, senior banking sources said.
   But the dollar still managed to hold on to gains against major
foreign currencies.
   Central banks decided to intervene after the dollar failed to
weaken, as expected, in reaction to what should have been negative
figures for the dollar, said a market source, who requested
anonymity.
   The dollar fell briefly after the release in Washington of
unexpected news on the U.S. Producer Price Index for July, but
almost immediately rebounded on renewed buying interest.
   The news that the inflation index fell 0.4 percent normally
would have been bearish for the dollar because it implies an easing
of interest rates may be at hand. The market had expected producer
prices to be up 0.1 percent.
   A separate report on U.S. retail sales helped alleviate some
recession fears. Retail sales, paced by renewed spending on
automobiles, rebounded 0.9 percent in July after posting their
first back-to-back monthly declines since early 1986.
   A string of European central banks including West Germany's
Bundesbank, the Bank of England and banks of Belgium, Italy and
Switzerland, were among those selling dollars. The U.S. Federal
Reserve also sold dollars, currency dealers reported.
   Several central banks, such as the Bundesbank, confirmed their
actions that were first reported by currency dealers. The Fed's
policy is not to comment on market reports of intervention.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5940 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5988 at midmorning and
$1.6280 late Thursday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.05 yen to a closing 140.10 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 141.50 yen vs. 141.05 yen
before the intervention.
   Selected dollar rates at midafternoon, with morning rates in
parentheses and compared with late Thursday's rate, included:
1.9285 (1.9230) West German marks, up from 1.8905; 1.6615 (1.6612)
Swiss francs, up from 1.6325; 6.5025 (6.4965) French francs, up
from 6.3955; 2.1860 (2.1608) Dutch guilders, up from 2.1275;
1,388.00 (1,382.00) Italian lire, up from 1,356.75; and, 1.1720
(1.1725) Canadian dollars, down from 1.1722.
   Gold prices fell in morning trading.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $365.30 a troy ounce,
compared with late Thursday's $365.75. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $364.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $364.50 compared with $366.35 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.51 to close at a bid $365.55.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.15 a troy ounce, down
from $5.16 on Thursday.

   The stock market churned ahead in active trading
today, pushing near record highs with encouragement from
unexpectedly favorable news on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 7.97 to 2,720.60
by noontime on Wall Street, just shy of the closing peak of
2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 825 up, 511 down and
504 unchanged.
   The Dow Jones industrial average made a short-lived run Thursday
afternoon past its peak of two summers ago, but then fell back in
late trading.
   This morning, analysts said buyers drew some fresh inspiration

   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.4 percent in July, posting its biggest
decline in three years. Advance estimates in the financial world
had called for the index to be unchanged or modestly higher.
   Interest rates fell in the credit markets after the figures were
reported. Prices of long-term government bonds rose nearly $10 for
each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields just below 8
percent.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose | to 50};

   UAL Corp. will likely face several suitors with
sweeter offers than the $5.4 billion bid by California investor
Marvin Davis, analysts say.
   Some expect the airline company's management to come through
with its own takeover bid that would include the participation of
employees of United Airlines, UAL's biggest subsidiary.
   But Davis met with UAL representatives Thursday night at an
airport in New York to discuss terms of the $240-a-share proposal
for the first time, The New York Times reported in today's editions.
   The newspaper, quoting people familiar with the offer, said
Davis was telephoned by UAL representatives about the board's
decision Wednesday to explore ``all possible financial and
strategic alternatives'' for its future.
   The newspaper said Davis did not expect UAL to be receptive to
the offer. Davis and one of his key advisers in the deal held a
series of meetings to prepare their presentatiion to UAL Thursday
night.
   The newspaper provided no other details of the meeting in New
York.
   UAL spokesman Rob Doughty said he could not comment on the
report.
   Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in
New York, said Davis' offer was at the low end of an acceptable bid
for UAL, which he estimated could fetch $300 a share, or $6.75
billion.
   A leveraged buyout by management is emerging as the most popular
scenario among industry observers in the wake of UAL's announcement
Wednesday.
   Analysts said UAL's management, employees and the company's
largest shareholder, financier Saul Steinberg, might join forces in
a leveraged buyout.
   In a leveraged buyout, a management group buys a company mainly
with borrowed money, which it usually pays back by selling some of
the company's assets or with its cash flows.
   Steinberg, whose Reliance Group Holdings Inc. has a 6.9 percent
stake in the company, is a longtime business associate and friend
of UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf.
   UAL's long-running labor disputes with its pilots and flight
attendants _ the pilots have been without a contract for nearly 1{
years, the flight attendants for about two years _ could provide an
incentive for management to invite employees to join forces in a
buyout.
   ``That might be a feature of a labor settlement,'' said analyst
Robert Decker of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ``It would be a way
for Mr. Wolf to aproach his unions and give them a stake in the
company with financial benefits, as well as a way of increasing
employee loyalty.''
   Sara Dornacker, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based UAL, said she
could not comment on the possibility of a management takeover.
   The United pilots, who made their own buyout offer nearly two
years ago, have asked their financial and legal advisers to study
the situation, said their spokeswoman Kathie Hardin.
   Leaders of United's flight attendants union local were out of
town and not immediately available for comment.
   UAL's stock rose $7.25 to $251.12{ a share Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange, reflecting speculation that richer proposals
would emerge. The stock ended last week at $164.50 a share.
   Pan Am Corp., which has been seeking a merger partner, is
interested in bidding for UAL, according to its chairman, Thomas G.
Plaskett. The financially weak airline company unsuccessfully
proposed a merger earlier this year with NWA Inc., parent of
Northwest Airlines.
   Another potential bidder, analysts said, is the powerful New
York investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co., which, like
Davis and Pan Am, bid unsuccessfully for NWA earlier this year. NWA
eventually was purchased by an investor group led by Alfred Checchi.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices surged in early trading today,
driven by a new government report on wholesale prices that
suggested inflation is under control.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond rose ~ point, or about $8.75 per
$1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from price, plunged to 7.91 percent from 8.05 percent
late Thursday.
   The Labor Department reported today that wholesale prices fell
0.4 percent in July for their biggest decline in three years.
Prices were pushed down by declining costs for gasoline and new
cars, the report said.
   The drop, as measured by the government's Producer Price Index,
followed a 0.1 percent dip in June, as the wholesale inflation
gauge registered its first back-to-back monthly declines since
early 1986.
   ``The bond market is stronger based on the Producer Price
Index,'' said Mitchell Held, managing director, chief financial
economist, Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The market had anticipated a rise of 0.1 to 0.2 percent, Held
said.
   The report is good news to bondholders, whose investments are
devalued by inflation. It also bolstered arguments of economists
that inflationary pressures will subside in the second half of the
year, giving the Federal Reserve more room to lower interest rates
in an effort to keep the economy out of a recession.
   Analysts said the credit markets took little notice of a second
government report on retail sales, which shot up 0.9 percent last
month to the highest level in three months. In addition, the
government revised upward May and June sales.
   ``The PPI is clearly outweighing the retail figures,'' said
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Credit market analysts said prices could reverse course once the
market digests the retail numbers.
   ``We thought consumer spending was in a recession and all of a
sudden we see that it has been rising,'' said Held. ``This could
influence the Fed's decision about easing credit.
   ``The Fed cannot ease unless we get some clearcut evidence that
this economy is weak and it simply isn't there,'' he said.
   Analysts said a healthy response to Thursday's $9.75 billion
refunding auction also carried over to this morning's market and
helped firm prices.
   The Treasury sold the 30-year bonds, which go on sale next week,
at an average yield of 8.14 percent, or slightly more than many
dealers had been expecting a few days ago.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues rose between 1-16 point to 3-32 point,
intermediate maturities were up between [ point and 5-16 point and
long-term securities had soared between 7-16 point and 1 1-32
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was up 3.95 to 1,193.54 by late
morning.
   In corporate trading, industrials also gained. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 0.80 to 332.58.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, fell to 7.99
percent with the discount down 10 basis points at 7.74 percent.
Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.86 as the discount lost 8 basis
points to 7.47 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.91
percent as the discount fell 10 basis points to 7.38 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other for overnight loans, was quoted at 9 percent, unchanged from
late Thursday.

   Retail sales, riding a wave of renewed auto
sales, posted a strong 0.9 percent increase in July, the government
said Friday in a report providing fresh evidence the country's
longest peacetime expansion was in no danger of ending.
   ``I think the widespread increase in retail sales indicates the
consumer is alive and well,'' commented Allen Sinai of The Boston
Co. Economic Advisers Inc. in New York. ``Certainly, the data
indicated no imminent recession.''
   ``You aren't going to find any reasonable economist now who will
tell you that we are heading into a recession,'' agreed Michael K.
Evans of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington.
   Economists watch retail sales closely as a barometer of economic
health since they account for about one-third of the nation's
economic activity. There have been fears that recent
credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve to contain inflation might
push the nation into a recession.
   But the Fed switched course in June and since then has nudged
interest rates lower in an attempt to attain a so-called
``soft-landing'' _ slower economic growth with low inflation. The
current economic expansion has lasted six and a half years.
   ``Bring out the champagne as far as (Fed Chairman Alan)
Greenspan is concerned,'' Evans said. ``He pulled off what most of
his critics said couldn't be done.''
   The Commerce Department reported retail sales increased to a
seasonally adjusted $143.7 billion last month following a 0.1
percent decline in June. The June sales had been revised to $142.4
billion from the $140.8 billion previously reported.
   The department also sharply revised its May report, saying sales
actually rose 0.8 percent rather than fell 0.1 percent. A spokesman
said the unusually large change resulted from retailers reporting
additional sales, including about $300 million each in the auto and
food categories and $100 million each in the restaurant, building
materials and general merchandise areas.
   Both revisions, together with Friday's report, point to a
stronger economy than previously thought.
   Automobile sales led June's increase, although almost all
categories posted moderate to strong improvements. The exceptions:
furniture and other home furnishings, down 0.3 percent, and
clothing, down 1.5 percent. Gasoline station sales remained flat.
   Car sales, which fell 1 percent in June, rebounded last month
with a huge 2.7 percent increase. That was the best sales month
since October 1988 when purchases rose 4.7 percent.
   July auto sales totaled $31.7 billion, the highest level since
$31.9 billion in December 1988, the department said. The sales
record was $33.9 billion in September 1986.
   Autos represent about 20 percent of total retail sales.
Excluding autos, July retail sales rose 0.4 percent, following
increases of 0.2 percent in June and 1.2 percent in May.
   Both durable and non-durable categories posted increases.
Durables _ big-ticket items expected to last more than three years
_ rose 1.7 percent after falling 0.9 percent in June and 0.5
percent in May. Besides autos and home furnishings, this category
includes building materials, up 0.6 percent.
   Sales of non-durable goods were up 0.4 percent after climbing
0.4 percent in June and 0.2 percent in May. Restaurant sales were
up 1.2 percent; general merchandise including department stores,
0.5 percent; food stores, 0.6 percent; and drug stores, 0.1 percent.
   For the three months from May through July, overall retail sales
were 6 percent higher than the same period in 1988.

   William A. Gill Jr., assistant executive director of the
mediation board, said the location of the talks would not be
disclosed.
   Talks between the two sides broke off a couple weeks ago when
the pilots requested an impasse. If the mediation board approves
that request, the pilots would be free to strike after a 30-day
cooling-off period.
   But Gill said no rulings have been made. He told The Associated

discuss their differences.
   The pilots' union and the company did not immediately return

   Share prices closed higher on Friday after a late
rally inspired by the release of U.S. economic data that pointed to
a slowing of the U.S. economy.
   The U.S. producer price index and retail sales figures for July
prompted a strong rally in U.S. stocks and bonds, though Wall
Street started dropping from its early peaks as trading wound up in
London.
   Despite the late rally, nearly half the top 100 stocks showed
price losses at the close.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 6.9
points, or 0.3 percent, higher at 2,354.2.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed 8.2 points higher at
1,969.6. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 3.21 points to
close at 1,326.14.
   Volume was 605.8 million shares, up from 574.5 million shares on

   In a land with more reindeer and
musk oxen than people, Hecla Mining Co. is hunting for rare
minerals for the electronics industry, a company official says.
   Hecla and two partners began drilling in June on a tract of land
in southeastern Greenland reached only by helicopter. Workers are
looking for deposits of niobium and rare earths, a group of 17
chemically similar elements increasingly in demand.
   ``Rare earths are weird and wonderful things,'' said W. Glen
Zinn, Hecla vice president in charge of exploration. ``They're
strategically critical and mined in only one place in North
America.''
   Hecla, based in Coeur d'Alene, holds 47 percent of the Sarfotoq
project, while Nuna Oil, a Danish national oil company, controls 50
percent. A German mining exploration company called Gewerkschaft
Wilhelm Bergbaugesellschaft holds 3 percent, Zinn said.
   Hecla will spend up to $500,000 this year on Sarfotoq, he said.
Another $4 million could be spent in the next four years if Hecla
decides to proceed with mining.
   The venture is a further step by Hecla into specialty metals. In
March, the company bought a $5.5 million gallium and germanium mine
near St. George, Utah. The metals are used in the making of fiber
optics and infrared lenses.
   Zinn said the partners secured government permission to explore
the area of land estimated at 36 square miles. A license to mine is
needed before production could begin. The site is near a game

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said Friday it would sell
its residential real estate operations to the Prudential Insurance
Co. of America for more than $300 million.
   The transaction, which includes Merrill Lynch Realty, a
residential broker with 18,000 salespeople in 450 offices
nationwide, will not have a significant effect on Merrill Lynch's
net earnings, the company said in a news release.
   The announcement marks the final stroke of a divestiture that
began four years ago when Merrill Lynch moved to focus on its core
broker-dealer businesses.
   Merrill Lynch said it will spend about $140 million to buy back
publicly traded units of the Fine Homes International L.P. at $18 a
piece before the partnership can be sold to Prudential.
   The brokerage formed Fine Homes, a master limited partnership,
to run its residential real estate operations after an unsuccessful
attempt to sell the operations outright. It was reported that
Merrill Lynch had hoped to reap at least $500 million from such a
sale, which would have included a residential mortgage business
that was eliminated in 1987.
   Instead, Merrill Lynch sold a minority interest in Fine Homes to
the public in late 1986. The brokerage retains a 74 percent
interest in the partnership.
   ``This transaction culminates Merrill Lynch's divestiture of a
business which, while profitable, is not part of our long-term
global strategy,'' said Merrill Lynch Chairman and Chief Executive
William A. Schreyer in a statement.
   Last year Fine Homes reported revenue of $792.2 million and
pretax income of $37.1 million.
   Also included in the transaction is Merrill Lynch Relocation
Management, which provides relocation services to the transferees
of more than 400 corporations; Landvest, a marketer of luxury
properties; Network 50, an international real estate referral
network, and Moran, Stahl &amp; Boyer, a management consulting firm.
   ``This acquisition is an extremely good strategic fit with our
growing operations in the residential real estate and relocation
mortgage businesses,'' said Robert C. Winters, chairman and chief
executive of Prudential.
   ``It represents an outstanding opportunity for us to strengthen
our position as a national provider of residential services, which
already include brokerage, mortgage lending, property appraisal and
homeowners' insurance.''
   Prudential entered the residential brokerage business two years
ago with Prudential Real Estate Affiliates, a California-based
operation that currently has 347 franchised offices and 4,900
salespeople. The company also provides home financing, homeowners'
insurance and appraisal services.
   Prudential will combine Fine Homes with its real estate
affiliates under a new unit. Fine Homes' realty offices will switch
to the Prudential name following the completion of the deal.
   Merrill continues to be involved in commercial real estate
through investment banking and remains a provider of mortgage
capital.
   The transaction is subject to regulatory approval.

<HEAD>Takeover Specialists Might Buy Up to 15 Percent of BTR</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. takeover specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
and Co. might buy as much as 15 percent of BTR PLC, a British
industrial conglomerate, the companies said Friday.
   Kohlberg Kravis has filed a statement with the U.S. Federal
Trade Commission indicating it intends to buy $15 million or more
of BTR shares in the open market, BTR said.
   The filing would allow Kohlberg Kravis to buy as much as 15
percent of BTR without making further disclosures to U.S. antitrust
authorities, BTR said. To acquire a 15 percent stake at current
prices would cost $1.9 billion.
   Kohlberg Kravis considers any stake it may build in BTR an
investment, BTR said.
   Kohlberg Kravis later confirmed the announcement, saying it was
``pleased with the receptivity of BTR to KKR being a shareholder in
the company.''
   BTR shares rose 58 cents to $7.28 on London's Stock Exchange.
   With the company's current market value at about $13 billion, a
takeover bid for BTR would rank as Europe's second-largest ever.
Only Hoylake Investments Ltd.'s pending, hostile $21 billion bid
for BAT Industries PLC would be larger.
   John Cahill, BTR's chief executive, said in a telephone
interview from Providence, R.I., that his company didn't believe
Kohlberg Kravis' move was ``sinister,'' and instead may represent a
play for a toehold in the British market at a time when British
stocks are undervalued relative to other markets.
   Kohlberg Kravis' ``past behavior pattern is not one of a hostile
bidder,'' he said.
   BTR produces equipment and components for the construction,
energy, automotive, electrical and other industries.

   The sale of the Claridge Casino Hotel
to a group of investors headed by a former casino executive has
been delayed past the original closing date of next Tuesday, an
official said Friday.
   A.L.M. Moonstone Inc., the purchasing partnership, was able to
find ``a more advantageous financing approach'' that led to a
paperwork delay, said Alfred J. Luciani, who heads the partnership,
said from his office in Las Vegas.
   The partnership has asked the Claridge board of directors for an
extension to complete its review before the state Casino Control
Commission, he said.
   Bob Renneisen, executive vice president of the Claridge, said
Friday that the board of directors is considering the request for
an extension.
   Luciani, former executive vice president of Golden Nugget Inc.,
and his partners agreed April 15 to buy the financially struggling
Claridge, a 501-room facility one block from the Boardwalk. A
purchase price has not been revealed, but Luciani said the company
plans to spend about $25 million to renovate the building.
   The Claridge lost $20 million in 1988 on revenues of $174.6
million. In June, Claridge Corp. took control of the casino hotel
from the Del Webb Corp. of Phoenix after completing a financial
restructuring plan.

   The stock market took a tumble in afternoon
trading today after an early run at new highs faltered.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than 15 points
in early trading, was down 25.60 at 2,687.03 by 3 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   That left the average still well short of the closing peak of
2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 540 up, 973 down and
480 unchanged.
   The Dow Jones industrial average made a short-lived run Thursday
afternoon past its peak of two summers ago, but then fell back in
late trading.
   This morning, analysts said buyers drew some fresh inspiration
from evidence that inflationary pressures have eased significantly
as the economy has slowed.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.4 percent in July, posting its biggest
decline in three years. Advance estimates in the financial world
had called for the index to be unchanged or modestly higher.
   But interest rates, after an initial decline in the credit
markets, surged upward again, and stock traders lost their early
enthusiasm.
   Rates on long-term Treasury bills, which pushed below 8 percent
in the early going, climbed to the 8.12 percent-8.18 percent range
by late in the session.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 2[ at 115]; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down }
at 39\; General Electric, down 1 at 57], and Eastman Kodak, down 1]
at 50].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.73 to 192.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.18 at 380.06.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 176.80 million shares with an

<HEAD>Corn Futures Soar The Limit On Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most corn futures prices closed up the daily
limit of 10 cents a bushel Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade
following a government report projecting a lower-than-expected U.S.
corn harvest.
   Other grain and soybean futures closed substantially higher.
   The USDA report, released Thursday afternoon, projected a corn
crop of 7.35 billion bushels compared with expectations of about
7.53 billion bushels.
   The government pegged this year's U.S. soybean production at
1.91 billion bushels compared with market estimates of about 1.95
billion and estimated the spring wheat crop at 487 million bushels
compared with the 493 million estimated earlier.
   The USDA also lowered its estimates for Canadian and Soviet
grain production, suggesting that demand for U.S. grains _
especially wheat _ is likely to increase.
   Analysts said the corn numbers were the most bullish among the
three markets. Soybean prices were held in check by perceptions of
a large South American soybean crop and by the USDA's revision of
its projected soybean stocks figure.
   The agency added 30 million bushels to the size of the projected
soybean stockpile on Aug. 31, the end of the 1988-89 marketing
year. The USDA now expects surplus soybeans to total 155 million
bushels this year.
   ``At first blush it was friendly, but once you got into the
supply-and-demand, it wasn't all that bullish,'' said Pat
O'Connell, grain-market analyst with Refco Inc., a large
Chicago-based futures brokerage.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 4\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.98 a bushel; corn was 5\
cents to 10 cents higher with September at $2.34 a bushel; oats
were 2{ cents to 4 cents higher with September at $1.41{ a bushel;
soybeans were 8 cents to 16} cents higher with August at $6.15 a
bushel.

<HEAD>Financier Declines to Swap Oceanfront Property With State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millionaire industrialist Victor Posner
has decided to build five 30-story condominium buildings on his
oceanfront property after rejecting a state offer for a land swap.
   The Florida Department of Natural Resources had been trying
since March to persuade the Miami Beach executive to swap his 13
acres of oceanfront property for 67 acres of state-owned land near
the Doral Country Club in Miami.
   The Posner tract, the city's only undeveloped oceanfront land,
is wedged between a strip of high-rises and would have made a
perfect setting for a park, state officials said.
   But Posner thought the swap would not have been profitable for
him, said his attorney, William J. Roberts.
   The Miami land, formerly owned by the Federal Aviation
Administration, is worth $8 million, while Posner's land is worth
$15 million, state officials said.
   Roberts said Posner would proceed with plans to build the
condominiums with 1,500 units on the site. ``We're going full speed
ahead,'' he said.
   But Posner still needs approval from the state because two of
the five buildings would be built near the ocean.

<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has agreed to pay
a $100,000 fine to the state Securities Department even though the
government said it has no evidence the firm did anything wrong in
the state.
   The consent order stems from the possibility that Drexel's
Beverly Hills, Calif., junk bond department might have committed
improper trades in Arkansas from 1984 through 1986.
   Drexel agreed April 13 to pay $650 million and plead guilty to
six felonies to settle Securities and Exchange Commission fraud
charges stemming from the government's insider-trading crackdown.
   State Securities Commissioner Beverly Bassett said Drexel would
pay the $100,000 even though it hasn't had an office in Arkansas
for four or five years.
   ``The incentive here is to avoid us revoking or suspending their
license,'' the commissioner said. ``This will sort of hold that in
abeyance _ even if the felony convictions don't relate to
activities in Arkansas, because they're registered in the state and
we don't look kindly on licensees having felony convictions.''
   She said the size of the fine was based on the size of Arkansas
and estimates of the amount of activity Drexel had in the state.
She said most of Drexel's junk bonds were sold to pension funds,
institutional investors and savings and loans.
   She said she has no idea what, if any, fraudulent securities
actions had been committed by Drexel in Arkansas during the time
period. ``My guess is it's not likely to be a significant number,''
she said. ``But we don't know. We're totally in a vacuum.''

   Directors of AMR Corp., parent of American
Airlines, strengthened the company's anti-takeover provisions
Friday even though the company said it was unaware of any imminent
takeover attempt.
   If any person or group buys 10 percent of more of AMR's
outstanding common shares, the company's share purchase plan would
entitle stockholders to buy additional shares at half price. The
original plan, adopted in 1986, called for the option to go in
effect after a 20 percent acquisition.
   Additionally, after a 10 percent acquisition, but before a 50
percent acquisition, the company's board of directors would be
entitled to exchange each share purchase right for one new share of
common stock.
   The share purchase rights plan was adopted originally to enable
stockholders to maximize the long-term value of their investments,
officials said.
   AMR spokesman Jim Brown said neither the orginal plan nor the
amendment is meant to block potential buyers from bidding for the
company.

<HEAD>GM `Pre-Introductory' '90 Car Prices Up an Average 3.4 Percent over
'89</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. on Friday announced an
average ``pre-introductory'' price increase of 3.4 percent for its
1990 model cars over comparably equipped 1989 models, a smaller
rise than analysts have anticipated.
   The announcement does not reflect final retail prices, but gives
an indication of how much GM prices may change from 1989 levels.
Ford Motor Co. has projected a 4.8 percent increase and Chrysler
Corp. has not yet made a projection.
   The smaller-than-expected boost could be from GM trying to
de-escalate the incentive war that has been going on for most of
the year, said Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton in New
York, who said he has expected price increases to be around 5
percent for the 1990 model cars.
   By holding price increases lower than anticipated, automakers
may be able to justify offering smaller incentives, and save on
those costs, he said.
   GM spokesman Terry Sullivan said the company was seeking to
partially recover increased material, labor, health care and other
costs. He said 0.9 percentage points of the increase could be
attributed to federal requirements for passive restraint systems in
1990 cars.
   GM plans to install driver-side air bags in 15 of its car lines,
or about 500,000 vehicles, during the 1990 model year. The rest of
the cars will have automatic seatbelts for drivers and front-seat
passengers.
   Thomas Wagner, general manager of Ford Motor Co.'s Ford
Division, said recently that he expected retail prices for 1990
cars to increase about 4.8 percent over 1989 prices. Half of that
increase was due to passive restraint systems, he said.
   Ford is expected to announce formally its 1990 prices in
mid-September.

   The dollar soared to its highest levels since
early summer in heavy worldwide trading Friday, boosted largely by
technical factors.
   Gold prices sank. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery fell $2.10 a troy ounce to close at
$365.20. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $363.50 an ounce, down from $366 on Thursday.
   The dollar's rally was already under way overseas when the
government released economic data showing a 0.4 percent decline in
July wholesale prices and a higher-than-expected 0.9 percent jump
in retail sales during the same period.
   The figures suggested that inflation may be abating while
economic growth continues.
   Typically when wholesale prices decline, ``interest rates come
down and the dollar gets weaker,'' said Jack Barbanel, a senior
vice president at Gruntal &amp; Co.
   ``But investors felt reasonably comfortable that the Federal
Reserve would not change (interest) rates, and they were right,''
he said. There was no change Friday in the federal funds rate, the
interest rates banks charge each other for overnight loans.
   Concerted dollar-selling by the Federal Reserve and other major
central banks failed to halt the currency's climb, and that only
served to ``reinforce its strength,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief
dealer at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   ``The way the market absorbed the dollars ... means intervention
will be ineffective in the short run,'' he said.
   In addition, the market was buoyed by Japanese investors' hearty
appetite for U.S. Treasury issues. The Japanese bought more 30-year
bonds than had been expected at this week's auction, and traders
think the trend could continue.
   Linda McLaughlin, a trader at Chemical New York Capital Markets
Group, said that with the upcoming redemptions of Japanese
government securities later this month, the Japanese are likely to
shift to higher-yielding U.S. securities.
   ``There will be a continued need for dollars'' to make those
purchases, she said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.05 yen close at 140.10 yen. Later in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 141.90 yen. In New York,
the dollar closed at 141.90 yen, up from 139.80 yen on Thursday.
   In London, the dollar spurted against the British pound. It cost
$1.5850 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6280 late Thursday. In
New York it cost $1.5820 to buy one pound, less expensive than
Thursday's $1.6188.

   Michael Grozier went to his local video
store to rent the latest hot movie. What he got was an idea that
turned the 28-year-old former sheet-metal worker into a millionaire.
   His Vidtron Inc. drive-in video rental stores in shopping-mall
parking lot kiosks feed off the frustrations of customers who can't
find the current top hits at larger video stores.
   ``What I wanted to try and create was that Golden Arches, the
big V in the sky. My goal, I guess, is to do to video what
McDonald's did to hamburgers,'' Grozier said.
   With only four stores open peddling one-night rentals at $2.49
each, Vidtron has a long way to go before becoming McDonald's, but
it's growing rapidly.
   Grozier has sold franchise rights for 21 regions across the
country. Stores are scheduled to open in several cities, and
franchise agreements already sold include promises to open about
400 stores, which would bring $1.2 million in fees. He said his
goal is 500 stores by 1991.
   The idea behind Vidtron was hatched one evening over hamburgers.
   Grozier and his wife had just been disappointed again, unable to
rent a newly released videotape because all the copies were gone.
   ``They were always out,'' Grozier said. ``It gets frustrating,
you know. ... My wife and I went to Dairy Queen, had a hamburger,
and while I was sitting there I said, `You know, somebody ought to
have a video store that just carries the top 40 movies, and it
ought to be a drive-through because you wouldn't need all that
space like you have in a traditional walk-in store ... just drive
in and get a video and drive on home.'''
   Grozier didn't really intend to be that somebody, but with his
wife's urging, he paid $250 for a kiosk once used by a drive-in
photo developer, spent $40 on signs, plunked down most of his
$5,000 life savings for videotapes and opened Vidtron in April 1986.
   ``I put it right across the street from that video store that
was always out, with the idea that they'll go in, can't get what
they want there and then they'll see my sign across the street.''
   A few months later Grozier brought in $400 on a Saturday night.
It cost him about $80 a day to run the store.
   ``I had a profit of a little over $300, which is more than I
made all week doing sheet metal work. So that convinced me that I'm
going to give up the sheet metal work,'' he said.
   In the 2{ years between the opening of his first store in
Cleburne and the first franchise sales last November, Grozier
created a detailed operating plan _ from where to locate stores to
what movies to buy.
   Some experts are skeptical of Grozier's chances, noting that the
big chains have become more sensitive to the kind of frustration
that started Grozier on his way. But with viewers paying an
estimated $197.5 million each week to rent movies, Grozier says
it's worth a shot.
   He opened a headquarters in Cleburne, and small town about 20
miles south of Fort Worth, and christened his company Vidtron,
hoping for a name that would become as synonymous with videos as
Kleenex is to tissue.
   He hired franchising experts to develop his precise system,
detailed in six manuals. The heart of it is Grozier's rating system
for movies' popularity.
   Grozier decided he couldn't wait for Billboard magazine to come
out with the top 40 videos in a given week, so he began rating
movies on his own, giving points for stars, producers, timing of
the video release, first run box office take and other factors
which he keeps secret.
   Movies are ordered based on their rating.
   Another key strategy is location. Grozier recommends each
Vidtron be located in a parking lot across the street or very near
a town's busiest video rental store.
   There are other rules, and Grozier demands they be followed:
``It's Michael's way or the highway,'' he said.
   Vidtron will not carry X-rated movies, and like some other video
rental businesses, he decided ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' was
too controversial a movie to handle.
   When one franchisee decided to carry ``Last Temptation'' anyway,
Grozier countermanded the order.
   ``When you buy a franchise, you buy into the system,'' he said.
   The franchises are not cheap: There's a $15,000 initial fee,
with $12,000 going to the regional franchise holder and $3,000 to
Grozier; and additional fees can push start-up costs as high as
$70,650. The lowest initial investment is estimated at $49,650.
   Each franchise location pays Vidtron weekly royalties of $87.25
for services that include training and ordering advice.
   ``I could have gone out there and just sold the stores _ wham,
bam like that _ but I couldn't service them properly,'' Grozier
said.
   Although Grozier said bankers turned him away initially, they
now ask him for business. He also is considering the idea of
selling stock to the public, he said.
   Grozier said that he and his wife occasionally return to Dairy
Queen for a hamburger, point to the table where they sat that
fateful night and say, ``That's where it all began.''

   The stock market yielded to a late round of
selling Friday, falling short for the second straight session in
its bid to reach a new high in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips, up more than 15 points in
early trading, was down 28.64 at 2,683.99 by the close.
   That left the average with a 30.54 gain for the week, but still
short of the closing peak of 2,722.42 it reached on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
586 up, 934 down and 477 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 197.55 million
shares, against 198.66 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 237.78 million shares.
   After an abortive run to new highs Thursday, analysts said
buyers drew some fresh inspiration Friday morning from evidence
that inflationary pressures have eased significantly as the economy
has slowed.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods dropped 0.4 percent in July, posting its biggest
decline in three years. Advance estimates in the financial world
had called for the index to be unchanged or modestly higher.
   But interest rates, after an initial decline in the credit
markets, surged upward again, and stock traders lost their early
enthusiasm.
   Rates on long-term Treasury bills, which pushed below 8 percent
in the early going, climbed to the 8.12 percent-8.18 percent range
by late in the session.
   Brokers said word of a surprising robust 0.9 percent increase in
retail sales last month contributed to doubts that the Federal
Reserve would relax its credit policy further in the near future.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 2 at 115{; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down | at
39]; General Electric, down } at 57|; Philip Morris, down 3\ at
160, and Eastman Kodak, down 1} at 50.
   Berkshire Hathaway, the highest-priced issue in the NYSE list,
fell 25 to 8,075. The company reported lower operating earnings for
the second quarter.
   UAL climbed 5~ to 257, completing a week in which it soared 92{
points after the company attracted a takeover offer from investor
Marvin Davis of Los Angeles.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $26.99 billion, or 0.79
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.70 to 192.27.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.18 to 394.38, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.51 at 344.74.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped 1.07 to 462.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 380.64, down 1.60.

   Wholesale prices, driven downward by new car
discounts and cheaper gasoline, fell 0.4 percent in July, their
biggest drop in three years, the Labor Department said Friday.
   At the same time, the Commerce Department said that retail sales
jumped 0.9 percent last month and that consumer spending in May and
June had not been as sluggish as previously thought.
   Analysts said the double dose of good economic news showed that
inflationary pressures were easing and that the economy was in no
danger of tumbling into a recession.
   Still, the financial markets reacted skittishly: In early
trading, bond prices soared and the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks rose above its 1987 all-time high. But then
sentiment turned bearish.
   By the end of the day, bonds fell and the Dow Jones industrial
average was off 28.64 points at 2,683.99, well shy of record
territory.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the day's reports
showed the country was on ``a sound economic course.''
   ``Unemployment is the lowest in more than a decade; inflation is
going down; growth is steady,'' Fitzwater said.
   Private economists, who have spent much of the year alternately
worrying about a possible inflationary spiral or an imminent
recession, said Friday's reports showed that both fears were
overblown.
   ``Alan Greenspan (chairman of the Federal Reserve) has pulled
off what most of his critics said couldn't be done,'' said Michael
K. Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm. ``You aren't going
to find any reasonable economist now who will tell you that we are
heading into a recession.''
   The Federal Reserve has been trying to engineer a so-called
soft-landing for the economy in which economic growth slows enough
to dampen inflationary pressures without dumping the country into a
downturn.
   Many analysts said the July increase in retail sales, the
strongest advance since April, coupled with upward revisions in the
previous two months showed renewed confidence in the important
consumer sector. Last week, the government said healthy job growth
had pushed the civilian unemployment rate down to 5.2 percent in
July.
   ``We have the best of both worlds, no inflation and increasing
consumer spending,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the
National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.
   The 0.4 percent July fall in wholesale prices was the biggest
one-month drop since July 1986, when prices eased 0.8 percent. Last
month's decline followed a 0.1 percent decline in June and amounted
to the first back-to-back declines since four consecutive downturns
from January through April of 1986.
   The news on inflation was particularly welcome because it came
after a surge in prices earlier in the year had triggered fears
that the country could be on the verge of another inflationary
spiral.
   Before the consecutive declines, wholesale costs this year were
racing ahead at an annual rate topping 9 percent. With the
declines, the annual inflation rate is now a more moderate 5.7
percent.
   Many economists predicted a further easing of price pressures in
the months ahead and said this would give the Federal Reserve more
room to lower interest rates.
   Since early June, the central bank has made three small moves to
push interest rates lower after a year-long effort to drive them
higher as part of its anti-inflation campaign.
   The two biggest factors pushing prices down in July were a 7.2
percent plunge in gasoline costs and a 1.9 percent drop in new car
prices.
   Labor Department analysts credited the drop in car prices to
unusually early end-of-the-model-year price cutting by automakers
trying to clear out large inventories of unsold cars before 1990
models appear. That development boosted car sales in the retail
sales report as well.
   The gasoline price decline, the biggest monthly drop since July
1986, helped to mask an increase of 1.5 percent in the cost of
natural gas and a 0.3 percent rise in home heating oil costs.
   Food costs, which had plunged 0.8 percent in June, edged up by
0.1 percent in July, reflecting higher beef prices, which rose 2.5
percent, and a 1.3 percent rise for fresh fruit prices.
   Prices also turned upward for fish, pasta, soft drinks, coffee
and rice.
   Partially offsetting the gains was another big drop in vegetable
prices, down 9 percent after an 8 percent June decline.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy categories fell
0.2 percent, a good sign that the underlying rate of inflation is
moderating, economists said.
   The improvement in July left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 114.0, meaning that a hypothetical selection of
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $114.00 last month.

   Farm policymakers are gearing up for another
effort to resolve an issue that has confounded Congress for a
decade _ huge disaster payments coming on top of major losses in
the insurance program that was supposed to end these payments
forever.
   ``We must choose one or the other,'' Agriculture Secretary
Clayton K. Yeutter told reporters a week ago after Congress sent to
President Bush a drought relief package of almost $900 million.
   Disaster relief packages designed to keep farmers afloat in
times of drought, flooding and other unforeseeable calamities were
a regular feature of agricultural politics until the current decade.
   In 1980, Congress revamped the federal crop insurance program,
which had been in effect in a miniature version since the Dustbowl
Era. The new, expanded version was supposed to replace disaster
payments. But it didn't.
   The current package of drought relief is the third approved
since Congress overhauled the crop insurance program and
policymakers remain in a quandary about the issue. ``It has been
nagging for years,'' Yeutter said.
   ``This is not something we'll be able to work out overnight, of
course,'' Yeutter said. ``It's a very complicated issue and one
that has a multitude of ramifications, but certainly we need to be
ready at the end of the year at the latest in terms of any
legislative proposals that might be required.''
   He said the timing is important because ``if we delay too long
in pulling all this together we'll have to confront some of the
same problems that we had in 1989. But we just have to take this a
step at a time and try to get it done as quickly as possible.''
   Yeutter left it open as to whether crop insurance changes should
be part of the farm bill lawmakers plan to draw up next year or,
instead, be incorporated into separate legislation. He said the
important thing was to choose one direction or the other and do so
in a timely way.
   ``We're determined and committed to dealing decisively with the
issue now rather than indecisively as has often been the case in
the past,'' he said.
   Addingto the urgency are big losses absorbed by the taxpayers
under the current program. Since 1980, the red ink has totaled $2
billion. Of that amount, $617,766,000 came as a result of the
drought last year, when the program paid out $2.42 in indemnities
for every dollar it received in premiums.
   Federal crop insurance has never actually broken even or into
the black, although it came within an eyelash of doing so in 1987.
   Congress has been hoping that an increase in participation in
the crop insurance program would take away the political pressure
for disaster assistance programs. So far that has not materialized.
   A 25-member commission established by Congress to seek ways to
broaden participation and upgrade the program gave its report to
lawmakers last week. Panel members were mainly representatives of
grower groups and the insurance industry.
   The panel recommends a wide array of changes in the program,
including new types of coverage, special provisions for soybeans
and sugar, revamped pricing procedures and a discount for producers
who pay their premiums early.
   One recommendation designed to entice greater participation
would expand the federal subsidy of crop insurance premiums.
   The government currently subsidizes 30 percent of the premium
for insurance on up to 65 percent of a farmers' crop. Under the
proposal, it would apply the same subsidy to the first 75 percent.
An additional, temporary subsidy would be applied to all levels up
to 65 percent.
   The commission is betting that the beefed up premium subsidies
combined with other elements of the plan would raise participation
considerably.
   The cost estimate of the program, however, assuming
participation by 40 percent of those eligible, would climb to $750
million a year. That could well mean raised eyebrows at the Office
of Management and Budget.
   Another recommendation would ``ensure that no agricultural
program, including disaster assistance programs, reduces or limits
the benefits of the program due to a producer's receipt of federal
crop insurance indemnity payments.''
   The idea is to avoid scaring off prospective crop insurance
buyers who might not be willing to purchase the coverage if they
believed that any indemnities they received would be subtracted
from their disaster assistance benefits.
   The recommendation also plainly envisions the possibility of
more disaster assistance bills coming through Congress in the
future.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Surge on Threatened Strike in Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices surged to a three-month high Friday on New
York's Commodity Exchange on panicky buying fueled by expectations
of a miner's strike beginning Monday in Peru, the world's
sixth-largest producer.
   The threatened strike is the latest addition to a long list of
supportive factors that may point toward a repeat of the dramatic
upward moves that occurred in late 1987 and late 1988.
   On other markets Friday, corn futures rose the daily limit;
sugar was sharply higher; energy futures fell; precious metals were
mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Copper futures settled 4.75 cents to 5 cents higher with August
at $1.1735 a pound, the highest settlement price for a nearby
contract since May 19.
   The threatened Peruvian strike triggered the move, but analysts
said the rally actually reflected the convergence of many
supportive factors.
   ``The copper market today was every commodity trader's dream:
the fundamentals and the technicals came together,'' said William
O'Neill, director of research for Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Key fundamental factors, besides the situation in Peru, included:
   _a 36-day-old strike at the Highland Valley copper mine in
British Columbia;
   _frequent power outages in Chile, one of the world's largest
copper producers, due to a drought;
   _the prolonged shutdown of the Bougainville copper mine, a
target of frequent terrorist attacks, in Papua New Guinea;
   _severe financial problems in Zaire and potential labor problems
in Zambia, two African nations that are important copper producers.
   On the technical side, the market pierced tough resistance at
$1.14 a pound, bringing in successive waves of buying.
   With so many problems plaguing the industry, copper production
is running below consumption for the third straight year.
   Analysts said the rally could mark the beginning of a bull move
similar to those of 1987 and 1988, when tight supplies drove prices
to record highs.
   Most corn futures prices closed up the permitted daily limit of
10 cents a bushel Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade following a
government report projecting a lower-than-expected U.S. corn
harvest. Other grain and soybean futures also advanced.
   The USDA report, released Thursday afternoon, projected a corn
crop of 7.35 billion bushels compared with expectations of about
7.53 billion bushels.
   The government pegged this year's U.S. soybean production at
1.91 billion bushels compared with market estimates of about 1.95
billion, and estimated the spring wheat crop at 487 million bushels
compared with an expected 493 million.
   The corn numbers were considered more bullish than those for
wheat and soybeans. Soybean prices were held in check by
perceptions of a large South American soybean crop and by the
USDA's revision of its projected soybean stocks figure.
   Wheat settled { cent to 4\ cents higher with September at $3.97}
a bushel; corn was 5{ cents to 10 cents higher with September at
$2.34 a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 4 cents higher with September
at $1.41{ a bushel; soybeans were 8{ cents to 16\ cents higher with
August at $6.15 a bushel.
   Sugar futures rose sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange, partly in anticipation of an expected large sugar
purchase by India and partly on bullish chart signals.
   Sugar contracts settled .33 cent to .57 cent higher with October
at 14.42 cents a pound.
   Crude and heating oil futures slipped while gasoline was mixed
in moderate trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with
little news to spur prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 14 cents
lower with September at $18.48 a barrel; heating oil was .03 cent
to .10 cent lower with September at 50.20 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .30 cent lower to .06 cent higher with September at
51.46 cents a gallon.
   News of a 0.4 percent drop in wholesale prices last month
triggered selling of gold futures on New York's Commodity Exchange.
Gold settled $2.10 to $2.80 lower with August at $365.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.9 cents to 3.1 cents higher with August at
$5.192 a troy ounce.
   Live cattle futures finished .35 cent lower to .10 cent higher
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange with August at 74.67 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .33 cent higher with
August at 85 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .60 cent higher
with August at 46.97 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .27
cent to .60 cent higher with August at 24.77 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished lower Friday after one of
the wildest sessions of the year, surging on encouraging inflation
news but plunging as traders decided the Federal Reserve was not
ready to loosen its credit policy.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond ended up with a loss of 1\ points,
or about $12.50 per $1,000 face amount. Earlier in the day, the
bond was up by about $15 for every $1,000 in face value.
   ``We used to get whipsaw days like this back in 1981 and 1982,
but you don't see reversals like this that often,'' said Elliott
Platt, fixed-income research director for Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp.
   The 30-year bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction
from price, rose to 8.15 percent from 8.05 percent late Thursday.
At midday, the bond's yield had fallen to about 7.91 percent.
   Bond prices moved sharply higher early Friday after the Labor
Department reported that wholesale prices fell 0.4 percent in July.
Many analysts had been expecting a modest increase. The decline was
the biggest in three years.
   Analysts said the report suggested inflation was no problem and
encouraged speculation that the Federal Reserve would encourage
lower interest rates, a development that would boost prices of
fixed-income securities.
   But traders who were looking for immediate action by the central
bank were disappointed when the Fed stepped into the market at
midday and arranged short-term sales of securities, a procedure
that drains reserves from the monetary system and places upward
pressure on interest rates.
   ``The market wasn't expecting that, and it took the wind out of
the rally,'' said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist for Dean
Witter Reynolds.
   He said a news service report that quoted an unidentified Fed
staffer as saying the central bank wasn't going to ease its credit
policy soon further depressed the market, and the selling seemed to
feed on itself.
   ``Once a trend is set in motion, it has a snowball effect,''
Flanagan said.
   David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in
Chicago, said as prices fell, traders took a second look at a
retail sales report also released Friday morning and found
surprising strength in the 0.9 percent gain for last month. He said

   The abrupt turnabout ``shows these markets have a speculative
quality to them,'' Hale said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues lost between ] point and | point,
intermediate maturities fell by about ~ point and long-term issues
gave up as much as 1\ points, according to Telerate Inc., a
financial-information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 7.47 to 1,182.12.
   In corporate trading, industrials dropped. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, fell 1.94 to 329.84.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3-16 point. The average yield to
maturity rose to 7.26 percent from 7.25 percent late Thursdday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, rose to 8.18
percent with the discount up 8 basis points to 7.92 percent. Yields
on six-month bills rose to 8.06 percent as the discount rose 10
basis points to 7.65 percent. Yields on one-year bills climbed to
8.16 percent as the discount rose 12 basis points to 7.60 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other for overnight loans, was quoted at 8 15-16 percent, down from
9 percent late Thursday.

   Employees of the nation's largest computer
company said Friday the firm would continue to pursue its dream of
becoming China's IBM even though its founder and president has
become an exiled pariah because he supported the protests.
   Since the pro-democracy uprising, the Stone Group Co., the
largest computer company in China, has launched a campaign through
letters and personal visits to dispel rumors it will be shut down
by the government because of its support for the student movement
and Western-style management techniques.
   Wan Runnan, founder, chairman and president of the company,
Stone Group Co., was fired from his posts and expelled from the
Communist Party because he supported the protests.
   Police are believed to have issued an arrest warrant for Wan,
43, but he fled to the West shortly after the June 3-4 military
crackdown on the protesters that left hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of civilians dead.
   Employees said the board of directors fired Wan in late July and
replaced him with Shen Guojun, formerly vice president and one of
Stone's co-founders. One employee said the company's upper echelons
have been reorganized.
   Employees at the company's showroom in western Beijing's
``Silicon Village'' laughed Friday at the rumors they would be
closed.
   ``Look, we're open, aren't we? We're all here. Nobody's told us
we're going to be shut down,'' said one department manager, who
like other Stone employees spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The showroom bustled with activity as clerks helped customers
pick out electronics parts and sales representatives demonstrated
equipment to potential buyers.
   From its founding in 1984, Stone quickly set itself apart from
other Chinese companies with its emphasis on employee incentives
and its ready adoption of international business practices. It
became China's leading private-sector success story, showing what
could be achieved with hard work and imagination under senior
leader Deng Xiaoping's economic reform program.
   In May, however, Wan is said to have joined student leaders in
calling for Deng and Premier Li Peng to step down and for the
government to lift martial law imposed to quell the protests.
   Stone also donated supplies to the students who occupied
Tiananmen Square, as did many private businesses.
   ``We were all down there delivering things like sterilized
towelettes _ even I went,'' a young sales manager recalled with
some embarrassment. ``We thought we were doing the right thing.''
   The government claims Stone donated more than just towelettes.
An official museum exhibit on the democracy movement, which the
government calls a ``counter-revolutionary rebellion,'' includes a
white, Daihatsu car that Stone allegedly gave to student leaders.
   Members of a Stone research institute collected signatures for a
petition calling for an emergency meeting of China's legislature to
discuss ending martial law.
   But on Friday, Stone employees tried to distance themselves and
the company from the democracy movement.
   ``Wan and the others are responsible for their own actions.
They've been investigated by the authorities. It doesn't have
anything to do with Stone,'' one said.

<HEAD>MAI Basic Four Expects Loss Due to Failed Bid for Prime Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUSTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer maker MAI Basic Four said Friday
it expects to report a significant third-quarter loss, primarily
because of expenses from its failed bid to buy Prime Computer Inc.
   MAI Basic Four on Thursday scrapped the last remnant of that
attempt, its $525 million cash offer to buy Prime Computer's
minicomputer business. Prime, of Natick, Mass., agreed last week to
sell the whole company to a New York venture capital firm.
   MAI Basic Four, a Tustin-based manufacturer of mid-size business
computers, said its abandoned tender offer for Prime, along with a
downturn in business, had forced it to begin restructuring, a
process that began last week.
   The company said it expected its earnings report for the quarter
ending June 30 to show a writeoff of $13 million to $15 million for
the restructuring and $5 million to $6 million in operating losses.
   The company said a streamlining it is undertaking is expected to
reduce direct costs and expenses by $25 million to $30 million, and
predicted it would return to profitability by the first quarter of
fiscal 1990.
   New York investor Bennett S. LeBow, MAI Basic's controlling
shareholder, is still trying to purchase Prime's minicomputer unit
through an MAI affiliate, Brooke Partners. LeBow hopes to oust
Prime's directors by proposing an alternate slate of directors at
Prime's annual meeting on Aug. 24.
   On Aug. 4, Prime accepted an offer of $1.2 billion from J.H.
Whitney &amp; Co. MAI Basic Four had been pursuing a purchase of all or
part of Prime for nearly nine months. Its efforts recently had
focused on a bid for just the minicomputer unit, which represents
about one-third of Prime's revenue, for $525 million.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., which publishes
books, sells insurance and operates theme parks, said Friday its
second-quarter loss narrowed slightly to $42.6 million from a loss
of $44.3 million a year earlier.
   Revenues for the quarter rose 5.3 percent to $434.4 million from
$412.4 million a year earlier.
   Publishing revenue rose 15.7 percent in the quarter to $221
million and insurance revenue rose 10.3 percent to $107.4 million,
but revenue from its theme parks fell 14.5 percent to $105.7
million.
   The company said its publishing results reflected some revenue
from textbook sales that are normally recorded in the third and
fourth quarters.
   Revenue from insurance operations benefitted from the inclusion
of results from 11 farm magazines previously reported with the
publishing group.
   Harcourt blamed the revenue decline at its six theme parks
partly on lost attendance at its central Florida theme parks which
faced competition from new attractions in the area.
   The company has put its theme parks up for sale in an effort to
reduce the debt it assumed two years ago when it undertook a
recapitalization that thwarted a takeover bid from British
publisher Robert Maxwell.
   For the first six months, Harcourt lost $158.7 million in
contrast to a loss of $79.6 million a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose 8.9 percent to $749.9 million from $689.1
million a year earlier.

   Northwest Airlines has reached tentative
agreement on a long-term contract covering its 5,000 pilots, it was
announced Friday.
   The contract offers an immediate average 9.3 percent pay raise
and 4 percent average pay increases in September 1990, 1991 and
1992. It also includes improvements in wage equalization, job
security and productivity, said Terry Erskine, vice president of
law and labor relations for the carrier.
   The contract would extend through March 1, 1994, combining under
one contract former Republic Airlines pilots and long-time
Northwest pilots. Northwest acquired Republic in 1986.
   Earlier Friday, an official with the National Mediation Board
said the pilots and carrier had ended a two-week stalemate in
contract negotiations by resuming talks at the board's urging.
   The talks had broken off during the last week of July when the
pilots asked the board to declare an impasse. The board had not
ruled on any requests in the dispute, said William A. Gill Jr., the
assistant executive director.
   ``All we have done is schedule a meeting for the parties to talk
about their differences,'' Gill said before the contract agreement
was announced.
   The pilots have been without a contract for about 2{ years.
Before a federal mediator intervened last year, the pilots had
voted overwhelmingly to strike over wage, benefit, work rules and
job security issues.
   The pilots' request for declaration of an impasse set up a
possible strike. But the mediation board would have had to grant
the request and a 30-day cooling-off period would have had to
expire before the pilots could legally walk off their jobs.
   Analysts had said a strike would be a serious blow to the
nation's fourth-largest airline because the carrier needs all the
cash it can muster in the wake of last week's $3.65 billion buyout.
Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi, who led the takeover, borrowed
more than $3 billion to finance the acquisition.
   The negotiations had been complicated by Northwest's acquisition
of Republic Airlines. An arbitrator merged the seniority lists of
the two pilot groups last week and negotiators had to unite the two
groups on other issues.

<HEAD>TWA Posts Net Loss of $4.4 Million for Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. reported Friday a net
loss of $4.4 million for the second quarter, which it attributed
partly to expenses stemming from last year's privatization of the
carrier.
   TWA, owned by takeover specialist Carl Icahn, said its
second-quarter loss compared with a net profit of $97.2 million in
the same period in 1988.
   The year-earlier results include a one-time gain from litigation
between TWA and the estate of the late Howard Hughes, a previous
owner. The results for the latest quarter do not include about $87
million in unrealized gains from TWA's investment portfolio, the
company said.
   The latest loss occurred despite a 5.7 percent increase in
second-quarter revenue to $1.20 billion from $1.14 billion.
   Late last week, TWA suspended contract talks with the Machinists
union because of the possibility of a merger or change in
management at the airline, union officials said.
   TWA, the nation's sixth-largest airline, confirmed that the
talks had been halted, but refused to say why. Icahn had previously
expressed interest in buying strikebound Eastern Airlines and had
been in extensive talks with that carrier's unions. His interest
recently has shifted to other possible combinations, according to
Machinists union officials.
   For the first half of the year, TWA posted a net loss of $87.4
million, compared with a net profit of $44.7 million in the same
period of 1988.
   First-half revenue rose 6.5 percent to $2.19 billion from $2.06
billion.
