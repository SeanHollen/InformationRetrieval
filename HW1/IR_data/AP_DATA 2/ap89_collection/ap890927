   A one-time chief aide to former HUD Secretary
Samuel Pierce refused Wednesday to answer questions from a House
subcommittee investigating the agency, saying he had been labeled a
``prime candidate for a criminal investigation.''
   Lance H. Wilson asserted his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination, just as Pierce did a day earlier.
   During the day's proceedings, a former HUD staffer told of
investigating a project on behalf of a contributor to President
Bush's 1980 campaign for the vice presidency.
   ``My counsel has advised me that it is unwise for anyone labeled
a prime candidate for a criminal investigation to testify under
such circumstances,'' Wilson told the employment and housing
subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations.
   Echoing comments Pierce made Tuesday, Wilson said he was
convinced ``the subcommittee had already prejudged me.''
   Pressed by committee members on how he had been prejudged,
Wilson cited a comment by Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., at a
July hearing at which Wilson failed to appear.
   Shays said then he was convinced people would be prosecuted for
influence-peddling and fraud at HUD and that Wilson was a prime
candidate for criminal investigation.
   Wilson is the fourth former Department of Housing and Urban
Development official to cite the Fifth Amendment.
   Deborah Gore Dean, who in 1984 succeeded Wilson as Pierce's
chief aide, and R. Hunter Cushing, former director of HUD's
multifamily housing programs, asserted the same rights in hearings
during the summer.
   However, only Pierce and Wilson alleged they had been pre-judged.
   Former regional HUD officials in testimony Wednesday described
Wilson as the man to see for getting approval of HUD grant, loan or
guarantee applications both during and after his tenure at the
agency.
   Dick Eudaley, who headed HUD's five-state regional office in
Fort Worth, Texas, from 1982 to May 1984, said Wilson had told him
that a $7 million apartment project in Fort Worth was going to be
approved despite unanimous opposition from the agency's technical
staff.
   ``The feeling within the agency was that this project had the
personal interest of the secretary's office and Mr. Wilson,''
Eudaley said.
   The 800-unit Regalridge apartment project developed by Fort
Worth real estate developer Leonard Briscoe is ``now in shambles''
financially, Eudaley said.
   Two years later, Briscoe gave Wilson a 15 percent interest in
the $24 million Wedgewood Plaza apartment project Briscoe was
developing in Riviera Beach, Fla., Lantos said.
   Alexander Naclerio, former director of housing in HUD's New York
area office, said he was called at home by Wilson on a weekend
evening in 1982 and asked to look into a project in Puerto Rico.
Wilson ``indicated this was on behalf of a major contributor to
George Bush's vice presidential campaign,'' Delio Rojo,'' Naclerio
testified.
   Naclerio said he reported his findings to Wilson, that revenue
from nearby commercial property owned by Rojo be used to reduce the
required subsidies.
   The Washington Post said in Thursday editions that HUD officials
it did not identify had reported an aide to Bush asked Wilson to
meet with Rojo about the project.
   The newspaper said aides to Vice President Bush said they made
referrals to government agencies without endorsements.
   Rojo's consultant, Carlos Figueroa, said he arranged the
Rojo-Wilson meeting on his own and probably discussed the matter
with Rafael V. Capo, an aide to the vice president.
   Naclerio, who became a consultant after retiring in 1986, said
he sent Wilson a $5,000 check that year after getting a $15,000
check from a Puerto Rican developer who had sought help on a HUD
rehabilitation project.
   Naclerio said he also sent a $10,000 check to Wilson in seeking
HUD mortgage assistance for a $123 million, 467-unit apartment
project in Manhattan after being told that the department's
approval was being held up because ``I had a problem with Hunter
Cushing.''
   Naclerio, a 39-year career employee at HUD before his
retirement, said Wilson called back and said Cushing assured him
there would be no interference.
   Wilson, a vice president of Paine Webber Group Inc., an
investment banking house, took the Fifth Amendment four times to
questions posed by subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos,
D-Calif.
   After several bitter exchanges between his lawyer and Lantos, he
did answer two questions posed by Shays.
   Shays asked if HUD's inspector general, who earlier this year
released a report finding widespread problems in the department's
moderate rehabilitation housing subsidy program, had tried to
interview him and if he had, in fact, been interviewed.
   Wilson responded ``yes'' to having been asked to meet with the
inspector general, and ``no'' to whether they met. Asked to explain
why he didn't meet with the inspector general, Wilson again cited
the Fifth Amendment.
   ``You have a lot of similarity with your boss, Samuel Pierce,
because he basically did the same thing,'' Shays said. ``He used
every excuse not to meet with the IG (inspector general) like you
did.''
   Wilson's lawyer, Raymond Banoun, tried to object but was
lectured by Lantos: ``You will not interrupt a member of this
committee.''
   Outside the hearing room, Banoun assailed the committee members
for ``ridiculing someone because he asserted his constitutional
rights.''
   Wilson requested and was granted a leave from Paine Webber after
his name surfaced in Lantos' investigation.
   Paine Webber Chairman Donald B. Marron told the subcommittee
Wednesday that Wilson had not sought approval to engage in outside
business activities, such as consulting, as required by the
company's code of conduct.
   Wilson signed a statement at the end of 1988 certifying that he
had abided by the company code, Marron said.
   James Treadway, a Paine Webber vice president who conducted an
internal inquiry into Wilson's activities after charges surfaced
that he used political connections to attract HUD-related business
for the company, said the probe turned up nothing improper.
   Lantos cited Paine Webber documents indicating that Wilson had
spent more than $10,000 entertaining HUD officials.
   ``To the extent they (the expenses) are personal, we will seek
reimbursement,'' he said.

   Twice a month, when the moon is full, Muoi
Cao Am and his wife take white flowers and incense to pray at the
graves of their sons, soldiers who died because of Vietnam's
intervention in Cambodia.
   ``We burn this incense to remember you. May God give you good
fortune,'' said Muoi, 70, bowing before the peeling white
tombstones invaded by grass. His wife, 66, stood aside and wept
quietly.
   Thinh, 18, was killed in Cambodia in October 1978, when Khmer
Rouge soldiers ambushed Vietnamese forces operating in the country
two months before Hanoi's invasion.
   The next year, Sau, 21, died along Vietnam's northern border
with China, which Beijing attacked to ``punish'' Vietnam for
invading Cambodia. That was two months before his first child was
born.
   The tombstones, yellowing photographs, and the equivalent of $2
a month compensation from the government are virtually the only
reminders of the youths their parents called ``kind and friendly.''
   The tragedy of the Muois, of Dan Phuong Tri village near Hanoi,
is the tragedy of the 11-year Cambodian war that some foreigners
have called ``Vietnam's Vietnam'' _ a comparison to America's
intervention in Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Vietnam says it has withdrawn its soldiers and will let the
Hanoi-installed government fight the guerrillas Vietnam couldn't
eradicate despite superior firepower.
   Vietnam is a Communist nation so the war has not provoked the
public anguish that tore America. But it is clear it was a costly
venture for Vietnam.
   The former deputy commander of Vietnamese forces in Cambodia
said last year that 30,000 Vietnamese died in border clashes with
Pol Pot's fanatical Khmer Rouge regime in 1977 to 1978, and 25,000
Vietnamese soldiers have died since Vietnam invaded in December
1978 and drove the Khmer Rouge to the jungles.
   Many of the remains of Vietnamese soldiers are along the
frontier at western Tay Ninh province, waiting to be returned to
families, said Gen. Tran Cong Man, editor of the official army
newspaper Quan Doi Nhan Dan.
   ``We will build a memorial for them at the border,'' he said.
   Tens of thousands of young Vietnamese served in what must be
among the world's most difficult battlefields. Tran Dinh Dac, 31,
recalled long periods in the forests, hungry, often stricken by
malaria, always fearful of guerrilla mines and ambushes.
   ``And the skins of the Pol Potists are thicker than that of the
Vietnamese,'' he said at his roadside drinks stand. ``They are not
affected by thorns.''
   The Cambodian war broke out after millions of Vietnamese already
had been killed or wounded in four decades of virtually continuous
fighting.
   The North Vietnam Communists had fought the French colonial
rulers, the Japanese occupiers of World War II, then South Vietnam
and its American allies. Thousands more died in China's punitive
strike across the border.
   Many millions who escaped the fire of battle also suffered.
   Non-Communist nations punished Vietnam for invading Cambodia by
diplomatic and economic blockades that have added to the poor
living conditions for Vietnam's 65 million people. More than
600,000 people have fled the country by boat in the last decade.
   ``Ten years ago the development of Vietnam and South Korea was
at the same level but now Korea has left us far behind,'' said a
Vietnamese government economist who requested anonymity.
   ``We hope to have peace to concentrate all our efforts to
rebuild our country, our economy. We want to begin a new period,''
Minister of Justice Phan Hien said in an interview.
   The young people today talk not of sacrifice for the revolution
but of school and careers, marriage and children, or simply
enjoying life.
   ``We have a hard time having fun. We are always working,'' said
a young Foreign Ministry worker whose major goals are being able to
go dancing to American pop music and to buy a Japanese-made
motorbike.
   A couple of months ago, students at the University of Hanoi
protested the conditions on campus, including the lack of equipment
and the meager salaries of teachers, a Western ambassador said. The
government promised improvements.
   The burden of the war in Cambodia probably won't end with the
withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.
   Tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers need jobs in a society
already troubled by high unemployment.
   Vietnam may also remain isolated because its pullout was not
internationally monitored and thus will be greeted with skepticism.
Also, the non-Communist world demands not just a pullout but a
political settlement in Cambodia.

<HEAD>Cuban Rights Activists To Be Tried Next Month</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three Cuban human rights activists will be
tried next month on charges of spreading false information after a
drug trafficking trial that led to several executions, Cuban's
official news agency said.
   Prensa Latina said Tuesday that Elizardo Sanchez, Hiram Abi
Cobas and Hubert Jerez were arrested in August and charged with
giving false information to U.S. television networks and Radio
Marti, a U.S. government station beamed to Cuba, in an attempt to
discredit Cuban courts.
   The prosecution has asked for prison terms of three or four
years for the three activists.
   Prensa Latina said lawyers for the defendants would have 10 days
to study the charges and prepare their cases, and that the trial
would begin within 20 days after that.
   The defendants were accused of telling U.S. media that Maj. Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez had been psychologically tortured and had
confessed to drug trafficking while under the influence of drugs
administered by his interrogators.
   Ochoa, a Cuban war hero, and three other men were executed in
July following trials that revealed a criminal ring in the Cuban
defense and interior departments that helped smuggle drugs from
Colombia to the United States.
   The trial and the corruption it revealed were extremely
embarrassing to Cuba's communist leader, Fidel Castro, who had
insisted for years that accusations of drug trafficking were part
of a U.S. plot to discredit his government.
   The three rights activists were members of a group called
Defenders of Human Rights, which Prensa Latina said was
``counterrevolutionary'' and illegal.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was
fitted with an external pacemaker after suffering an erratic
heartbeat, but the device was turned off Tuesday, hospital
officials said.
   Marcos' heartbeat returned to normal after the device was
attached Monday night, said Eugene Tiwanak, assistant administrator
of St. Francis Medical Center, where Marcos has been hospitalized
since Jan. 15.
   Hospital spokeswoman Norma Kop said doctors decided Marcos'
heart could beat normally on its own, and device was turned off
Tuesday. It remained at his side and could be reattached if
necessary, she said.
   Doctors had no plans to insert an internal pacemaker, she said.
   The 72-year-old Marcos has suffered near-total organ failure
since being admitted to the hospital nearly nine months ago. He is
attached to life-support equipment and remained in critical
condition Tuesday.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, have lived in exile in Hawaii since
February 1986, when he was ousted in a popular revolt.

<HEAD>Ingmar Bergman Writes Revealing Play About his Parents</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a child, Ingmar Bergman's parents
locked him in a dark closet when he disobeyed. To amuse himself, he
beamed a flashlight with a colored light onto the wall and
pretended he was at the movies.
   Now 71, the famed director has written a screenplay about his
father, Erik Bergman, an insecure and depression-prone pastor, and
his mother, Karin, a woman of iron self-discipline who cringed at
any show of love.
   In ``Good Intentions,'' Bergman casts back his memory and his
imagination to the first 10 years of his parent's turbulent
relationship and marriage.
   The play is a six-hour chronicle in four acts, to be shown as a
four-part television series and a two-part movie. Production begins
late next year, and the scheduled premiere will be on Swedish
television Channel One in 1992.
   ``I feel a great need to tell the story of these two people who
are in my blood, my nerves and my genes,'' Bergman said.
   Bergman gave up film direction after his 1982 ``Fanny and
Alexander,'' which won four Academy Awards. Since then, he has been
busy producing stage plays at the Royal Dramatic Theater in
Stockholm, which once rejected him for a job when he was an
aspiring 21-year-old production assistant.
   For ``Good Intentions,'' Bergman vacated the director's chair to
Danish filmmaker Bille August, whose ``Pelle the Conqueror'' won
the 1989 Academy Award for best foreign film. Bergman said that
after he saw ``Pelle'' six times, the choice of the 40-year-old
Dane was obvious.
   August called the screenplay ``one of the best love stories I
have ever read. It is a great drama and an honor to take part in
delivering.''
   As evidenced in his confession-like autobiography, ``The Magic
Lantern,'' Bergman has been grappling with confusion for many years
over his feelings for his parents.
   They have appeared on screen before, in some of the best of
Bergman's 50 films. In ``Fanny and Alexander,'' a soft-spoken
clergymen slowly exposes himself as consumed with fanaticism and
hatred.
   The 1973 film ``Cries and Whispers'' is about three sisters and
a servant girl. Bergman has said they represent four aspects of his
mother, whom he was seeking to understand through his characters.
   He nurtured the idea for ``Good Intentions'' ever since
completing ``Fanny and Alexander.'' In his memoirs, he wrote about
his parents from his childhood perspective, which was often brutal
and angry.
   It left him unsatisfied. ``I started writing about all the
dreams and memories of my parents. Finally, I had a script,'' he
said. It took him five months last year to write it.
   The new film promises a sympathetic look at a young couple, a
theology student and a somewhat spoiled young woman from an
affluent home. The characters have fictional names, which allows
Bergman to play with facts.
   The movie covers the time of the couple's meeting in 1909 to the
year of Bergman's birth in 1918.
   In his memoirs, Bergman wrote about his failure to reach his
parents and his own attempts to hide despair by burying any display
of feeling. His emotions, he said, ``inhabited a closed room and
were produced on command, but never rashly.''
   He was raised according to ``the concepts of sin, confession,
punishment, forgiveness and grace _ concrete factors in
relationships between children, parents and God.''
   He described his father, a Lutheran minister, as ``nervous,
irritable and depressive. ... He was always fretting and given to
violent outbursts of temper.''
   His mother ``was always tense, slept badly and used strong
remedies which had side effects causing restlessness and anxiety.
Like Father, she was haunted by a sense of inadequacy.''
   The book barely touches on his parent's feelings for each other,
but a stormy picture emerges when it does.
   As a child, he recalled seeing them in a fierce argument and
scuffle. ``We didn't know that Mother had gone through a passionate
love affair or that Father suffered from severe depression. Mother
was preparing to break out of her marriage, Father threatening to

   Divorce in those days was almost unthinkable, especially for a
respected pastor, and the church stepped in to reconcile the couple.
   Yet the reconciliation was mostly for show. ``What was outwardly
an irreproachable picture of good family unity was inwardly misery
and exhausting conflicts,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>Chess Champion Kasparov to Play Computer</HEAD>

   World chess champion Gary Kasparov has
vanquished all challengers since capturing the title in 1985, but
none of those opponents could calculate 720,000 possible
chess-piece arrangements in one second.
   Deep Thought can.
   Deep Thought, a chess-playing computer created by researchers at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, will challenge Kasparov
on Oct. 22 at the New York Academy of Art. At least one chess
expert thinks the computer could outduel the champion.
   ``Deep Thought is clearly the first chess computer with the
potential to draw blood and defeat the world champion,'' said chess
commentator Shelby Lyman, who helped arrange the match-up.
   Robert Byrne, chess correspondent for The New York Times,
disagreed: ``I would say it is not yet ready to mount a serious
challenge to Mr. Kasparov.'' But that could just be sour grapes _
Deep Thought defeated Byrne when the two squared off.
   Byrne became the second chess grandmaster beaten by Deep
Thought; the first was Bent Larsen of Denver, the world's
96th-ranked player with an International Chess Federation rating of
2580 based on his tournament performances.
   In comparison, the computer's rating from the United States
Chess Federation is 2250; the International Chess Federation put
Kasparov at 2775.
   Deep Thought captured the 1989 World Computer Chess Championship
in Edmonton, Canada. The matchup with Kasparov is part of an annual
chess competition sponsored by ASG Computers Inc.

   Educating youngsters about drugs and
alcohol should be the key in any anti-drug effort, says Boys Town's
16-year-old mayor.
   As mayor, Randy McBride said he is able to be more visible to
teen-agers who may need support fighting drugs, gangs and other
problems.
   ``The drugs and the gangs, they're not just hurting each other.
They're hurting the lives of innocent people,'' McBride, a senior
at Boys Town High School, said recently.
   ``This is a sad time for us (teen-agers) because the lure of
drugs is so strong and the underground world is really getting
bad.''
   McBride arrived at Boys Town, which was started by Father Edward
J. Flanagan in 1917, a year ago from New Orleans. He was elected
mayor last May.
   McBride said he plans to attend St. Michael's College in Vermont
and major in international law.

   Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney opened his first
foreign tour in 13 years at a community hall in this out-of-the-way
city south of Oslo.
   With 6,000 fans shouting, ``We want Paul,'' McCartney took to
the stage Tuesday evening with his wife, Linda, and a tour band.
   The concert, which kicked off a four-month European tour,
included a heavy dose of Beatles songs. The two-hour show began
with ``Figure of Eight'' from McCartney's latest album, ``Flowers
in the Dirt,'' and ended with a medley from the Beatles album
``Abbey Road,'' released 20 years ago.
   ``It isn't everyday I know all the words to all the songs at a
concert,'' said Sigbjoern Nedland, a music critic. ``It surpassed
my expectations by 150 percent.''
   Before the show, one Oslo newspaper dubbed McCartney ``Nervous
Paul'' because only Norway's domestic media was invited. Uni
Arnesen of EMI Records, said foreign news organizations were kept
out because McCartney wanted to warm up ``off Broadway,'' as he put
it when the tour was announced in July.
   The singer embraced the environment as the tour's theme and
distributed pamphlets from the group Friends of the Earth. ``At the
end of the tour it would be nice to look back and see that it meant
something,'' McCartney said.

   Poland's two living Nobel Prize recipients
held a warm reunion, with Peace Prize laureate Lech Walesa saying
the works of literary winner Czeslaw Milosz ``shaped me and a whole
generation.''
   Milosz, the poet-essayist who won his Nobel in 1980 after having
fled Poland in the 1950s, has long been a supporter of Walesa and
critic of communist cultural controls. His books were banned
throughout the East bloc but in recent years became available in
Poland and several other countries.
   ``I was in jail several times for (the ideas contained in) Mr.
Czeslaw Milosz's books,'' Walesa said Tuesday.
   The two first met in Poland in 1981, during Solidarity's first
brief 16-month legal existence that preceded a martial-law
crackdown. Walesa received his Nobel two years later.
   Solidarity now sits in the prime minister's office.
   ``It is good fortune to live until this moment,'' said Milosz,
who lives in Berkeley, Calif., and is visiting Poland for only the
second time since emigrating.

   Priceless diaries and other Confederate
relics have been destroyed or damaged by Hurricane Hugo, the
director of the Confederate Museum says.
   What's left of the collection was to be moved today, said the
director, June Wells.
   The roof of the 148-year-old Market Hall building was blown
away, exposing the collection's flags, papers and uniforms to wind
and rain.
   ``The damage is quite extensive,'' said Mrs. Wells, one of the
160 or so members of the Charleston Chapter of the United Daughters
of the Confederacy, which owns the collection.
   ``The reason we're having to leave so quickly is the ceiling is
falling.''
   Many paper items have been damaged, she said, including portions
of a daily log kept at Fort Sumter by the fortress' engineer during
fighting in 1861 and 1863 after Confederate forces occupied the
site.
   Those papers, she said, are now ``soaking wet, and of course it
was water-soluble ink. Some of them hopefully we can dry out.''
   Mrs. Wells said the collection was started when Confederate war
veterans convening in Charleston in 1898 donated memorabilia.
   The city-owned building is itself significant.
   ``When the War Between the States started, our Market Hall was
where the young men came into Charleston to get their armaments and
supplies and destinations,'' she said.
   The collection includes the first rifle cannon made in America,
the original secession flag flown at Charleston's Customs House
after South Carolina seceded from the Union on Dec. 20, 1860, and
the first and last Confederate flags to fly over Fort Sumter, where
the first shots of the war were fired, on April 12, 1861.
   The museum is selective.
   ``Nothing from Sherman,'' she said of William Tecumseh Sherman,
the Union general who led the March to the Sea from Atlanta to the
Atlantic.
   ``No Yankee things. The only thing we have are a few captured
Yankee things.''
   Mrs. Wells is uncertain where or for how long the collection
will be stored.
   ``This will be first time they've ever left that building since
they were put there in 1898,'' she said. ``The building is unsafe
and the collection is unsafe. ... It's kind of unbelievable.''

   A commuter plane crashed and
burned as it attempted to land in heavy fog Tuesday and all seven
people aboard were killed, officials said.
   The twin-engine Skylink Airlines jet was on its second approach
to the Terrace-Kitimat airport in northwest British Columbia when
it went down, said Christiane Cote, a spokesman for Canada's
transporation department. The plane was carrying five passengers
and two crew members.
   ``What we know at this stage is the weather conditions were very
bad and the airport was covered with fog,'' Cote said from
Vancouver. ``Therefore visibility was minimal.
   The plane crashed at 8:25 a.m. in a heavily wooded area just
west of the airport, said Ian Swan, base manager for Northern
Mountain Helicopters in Terrace who flew over the site.
   Rafael Zur, president and owner of Skylink, said the airplane
was four years old and had passed an inspection two weeks ago.
   Flight 70 was on a regularly scheduled flight from Vancouver to
Terrace and Smithers when it crashed, said Zur. Terrace is in the
west-central area of British Columbia, about 435 miles northwest of
Vancouver.
   Skylink Airlines, based in Richmond, British Columbia, was
founded in 1984 as a commuter service. It has a fleet of 11 planes.

   A couple who won a $6.5 million Lotto jackpot put

take care of their tomatoes.
   Forrest and Edna Hiller of Arvada learned Sunday they had won,
but didn't turn in their ticket until Tuesday so they could cook
and can a six-month supply of homemade spaghetti sauce.
   ``Our tomatoes were at a crucial point where we had to take care
of them, or we would have lost them,'' said Hiller, a 66-year-old
retiree.
   On Sunday, he picked up the newspaper and checked the numbers.
``There, just like a bolt out of the blue, those beautiful numbers
showed up,'' he said.
   ``I began to shake a little downstairs and then I went up to
where she was,'' he said of his 74-year-old wife. ``I was a little
frightened to know how to tell her for fear she might have a heart
attack or something. ...
   ``Finally, I just broke down and said, `Well, Maw, hang onto
your hat, we hit the big one.'''
   On Tuesday, the couple, who have been married 33 years, received
their first annual payment, $123,500 after taxes.
   The remaining progressive payments will be made over 25 years,
with the last to total $295,347. That payment will come when Hiller
is 91 and his wife 99.

   Goats love to eat kudzu. The South is full of
the tangly vine. A scientist thinks the South needs goats.
   Al Smith, a University of Georgia agronomist, says that's a
simple way to control kudzu.
   Kudzu, which clogs prime development property and can kill trees
by blocking out sunlight, came from Japan as an ornamental plant in
1876.
   It has spread to more than 1 million acres in the South.
   He said four goats will kill an acre of the vine in two years of
grazing.
   Chemicals might do the job faster, but goats won't hurt the
environment _ except for kudzu, he said.

   After 42 days of smooching, a lawyer unlocked
the lips of three couples in the first annual Great American
Kiss-Off. Lips are sealed, though, as to how they'll split the
$10,000 top prize.
   ``We thought it was going to be a two-week thing, but it turned
into a marathon,'' Fernando Gonzales said Tuesday, one day after
all parties embraced the pact. ``I'm recovered now. But it still
feels like I'm kissing.''
   He and his wife, Karen, were declared the official first-place
finishers after they and two other couples outlasted 11 other pairs
who entered the contest sponsored by a furniture company. Company
officials also are keeping their quiet over the $10,000 split.
   Reno attorney Pat Cashill said he was hired by parents of the
two other couples in their late teens and early 20s to help end the
contest so their children could get on with their lives.
   ``These people were really caught up in a horrible situation,''
Cashill said. ``It was like they were in bondage. They wouldn't
quit; $10,000 is a lot of money.''
   Under the agreement, the Gonzaleses got the deed to an Idaho
time-share condominium, which was the first-place prize along with
the money.
   The declared second-place finishers and winners of an
expenses-paid trip to Mexico were Lloyd and Laura Gubler of Reno.
Bret Watson and Lori Block of Reno claimed the third-place prize of
new living room furniture.

<HEAD>Haitian Leader Calls For Restoration of U.S. Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The United States should restore
$60 million in suspended aid now that Haiti has scheduled elections
for next year, military president Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril says.
   Avril, in power since being installed in a coup a year ago, said
that without international assistance his government has been
unable to provide the people of this impoverished Caribbean nation
with jobs and and security.
   ``Nevertheless, we have demonstrated our will to govern this
country democratically,'' Avril said in an interview Monday at the
National Palace. ``But if the U.S. does not assist us financially,
we still may have problems.''
   Washington suspended two-thirds of its direct aid to Haiti after
a Nov. 29 1987 election-day massacre and the subsequent suspension
of balloting by the military. The U.S. government has said that
transfering power to a civilian government is a key condition for
restoring the aid.
   Avril's government said Sunday that local, legislative and
presidential elections will be held next year. In the interview,
Avril said the army would not interfere with the balloting and
would ensure security.
   The government has not said, however, whether or not it will
allow international observers monitor Haiti's next election.
   Presidential elections are to be held in two rounds _ Oct. 17
and Nov. 11, 1990. The first round will be among about 10
candidates and the second will be a runoff among an unspecified
number of the top vote-getters.
   ``We have announced the electoral timetable. We now expect to
receive the assistance which will make the elections a success,''
Avril said.
   When asked whether he would be a candidate Avril said, ``The
only thing I do with my power is try to put my country on the road
to democracy, the only way to develop this country.''
   Under Haiti's constitution, no member of the military can become
president less than a year after resigning. Therefore, Avril would
have to resign before Oct. 17 in order to run.
   Next year's balloting will be Haiti's first presidential
election since Jan. 17, 1988, when civilian Leslie Manigat was
elected in balloting widely regarded as fraudulent. He was ousted
in an army coup five months later.
   A previous military government stopped balloting during the 1987
election when street gangs assisted by soldiers shot and hacked to
death 34 people at the polls.
   The canceled vote was the first attempt at free elections after
decades of Duvalier family dictatorships. President-for-life
Jean-Claude Duvalier, who succeeded his father Francois ``Papa
Doc'' Duvalier on his father's death, fled during anti-government
demonstrations in February 1986 and now lives in France.
   Avril, 51, took power on Sept. 17, 1988, after a coup against
the regime of Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy that was organized by
non-commissioned officers. The coup leaders said they wanted
democratic reforms and an end to what they called state-sponsored
violence.
   Shortly after taking office, Avril began a 19-point program to
give Haiti a constitutional government, purge undesirable elements
from the army and improve soldiers' living conditions.
   On Dec. 14, his government signed five international human
rights conventions. But rights groups have said violations, often
perpetrated by soldiers, are still common in Haiti, where 80
percent of the 5 million residents live in poverty.
   In March, Avril partially restored the 1987 constitution that
Namphy had suspended and in April installed a nine-member
independent electoral council to organize next year's elections.

   Teresa Stratas returned to the Metropolitan
Opera on the second night of its season, for the first time since
the 1981-82 season, and triumphed.
   She sang, gloriously, in all three of the Puccini one-act operas
called ``Il Trittico.''
   Before the evening began on Tuesday, an announcement was made
from the stage that Miss Stratas had food poisoning on Sunday and
was feeling weak but would sing.
   An unusually long first intermission made the audience uneasy
about the Canadian soprano's health. But in the second opera,
``Suor Angelica,'' she touched the audience's heart and made the
biggest triumph of all. That opera received a standing ovation and
small pieces of paper were thrown from balconies.
   Miss Stratas always has been an actress, acting by moving on
stage and by coloring her voice, creating people of depth of the
characters she sings.
   When she sings as Sister Angelica, in a convent, one could
imagine her previous life of enthusiasms, sorrows and loveliness.
She is visited by her aunt, a princess, who says the child she bore
out of wedlock has been dead two years. Miss Stratas flings herself
down with a howl of naked pain.
   Only twice during the evening was she shrill with high notes,
both for effect.
   The other time was during the first opera, ``Il Tabarro'' (``The
Cloak''). Miss Stratas always has been superb as gritty characters,
the kind some prima donnas are too stiff or grand to convey. In
``Il Tabarro'' she is the bored, restless wife of an aging barge
captain, attracted to a handsome younger man.
   The despairing barge captain finds out, strangles the young man
and hides the body under his long cloak. Usually, the opera ends by
his opening the cloak and showing his wife the corpse. On Tuesday,
it was made a little more gruesome, the husband enfolding his wife
under his cloak, too, then pushing her down atop the corpse.
   In the final opera, the splendidly staged comic opera ``Gianni
Schicchi,'' Miss Stratas sang a smaller role, the young daughter of
Gianni Schicchi. But in it, she gets to sing the most famous aria
of the evening, ``O mio bambino caro,'' which she did with sublime
tenderness.
   Other important singers of the evening were Juan Pons and
Giorgio Merighi as the husband and lover in ``Il Tabarro,''
Florence Quivar as the cold princess in ``Suor Angelica'' and Bruno
Pola as Gianni Schicchi, along with Mignon Dunn, Vinson Cole and
Federico Davia among a dead man's avaricious relatives.
   James Levine conducted.

   As Vietnamese soldiers nearby packed
their bags to return home, a dozen Cambodian troops were loading
crates of Soviet-made mortar rounds onto a truck bound for the
distant mountains.
   Just down the dirt road, bare-chested Kan Kun, one of the
country's tens of thousands of village militiamen, showed off his
AK-47 automatic rifle and two magazines.
   ``All the men who can, use a gun to fight Pol Pot,'' he said,
referring to the shadowy figure believed to still lead the Khmer
Rouge guerrillas.
   It was an ominous portent of Cambodia's future, these scenes
that reporters stumbled upon along the Tonle Sap lake in
northwestern Siem Reap province.
   What Hanoi said were its last soldiers in Cambodia returned home
Tuesday, 10 years and nine months after Vietnam invaded, ousted the
fanatical Khmer Rouge and sparked a civil war.
   Like the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Vietnam's purported
pullout likely will improve the international standing of the
former occupier but condemn the country it occupied to a new phase
of fighting.
   Since peace talks again have failed, the Vietnamese-installed
Phnom Penh government will now face guerrillas alone as the
Soviet-installed government in Kabul has done since the Red Army
went home in February.
   But Kabul still stands, despite widespread predictions of a
quick collapse, and Phnom Penh's position is even stronger, said
many diplomats, including a Soviet Embassy official and Ngo Dien,
Vietnam's ambassador to Phnom Penh.
   Unlike Kabul, Phnom Penh controls most of the country's
territory, they said. The Afghan resistance can recruit from 6
million refugees in Pakistan, while the Cambodian guerrillas have
just 300,000 in Thailand.
   The Afghan guerrillas have much wider international backing, and
support from the people within Afghanistan.
   The Khmer Rouge, the largest Cambodia guerrilla group, is widely
hated and cannot survive without Chinese and Thai support _ and
that is wavering.
   ``In the not too far away future, I don't think Thailand will go
on supporting the Khmer rouge, and China also,'' Ngo Dien said.
   The Communist Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people
in during its nearly four-year rule as it tried to turn the country
into a primitive agrarian commune.
   Just as in Afghanistan, superpowers continue supplying the means
to kill. Chinese shipments continue. So do Soviet arms to Phnom
Penh, Soviet Ambassador Rashit Khamidouline said, although they
were not increased with Vietnam's pullout because ``we don't want
to escalate the war.''
   The Khmer Rouge siege of Pailin, near its sanctuaries in
Thailand, has been compared with the Afghan guerrillas' siege of
Jalalabad, near the Pakistan frontier. The Cambodian guerrilla
attempt to create a ``liberated zone'' has intensified with
Vietnam's retreat, and is seen as a crucial test of whether pure
firepower can resolve the war.
   Most analysts say neither army can win in Cambodia.
   The key then will be whether there can be talks between Phnom
Penh's Premier Hun Sen and guerrilla leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, who heads the coalition joining his forces with the Khmer
Rouge and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   ``In the coming dry season ... the guerrillas will launch
attacks to test the strength of the Phnom Penh government. After
that, both sides may become more flexible,'' said Khieu Kanharith,
a prominent newspaper editor in the Cambodian capital.
   If genuine, the Vietnamese pullout would weaken Phnom Penh
militarily but perhaps more crucially, it would erode the
guerrillas' international position.
   The guerrillas call the troop movement a fake, but many
diplomats believe Vietnam has withdrawn at least the bulk of its
army. That weakens the key guerrilla charge: that Phnom Penh is
merely a Vietnamese puppet.
   The guerrillas may also lose morale if they see they are now
only killing fellow Cambodians.
   Anticipating this, the guerrillas recently stepped up charges
that Vietnam is controlling the country with 1.25 million
Vietnamese settlers.
   Phnom Penh wants a political settlement because otherwise most
non-Communist countries will not end diplomatic and economic
embargoes that have hurt impoverished Cambodia.
   But it sees a good second option in hints that even without a
settlement, a few countries like Australia and Thailand may
recognize Phnom Penh after a general election expected early next
year.
   There are no signs of progress on breaking the central impasse
in talks: the future of the Khmer Rouge.
   Hun Sen repeated Sunday that he will make no concessions on his
demand that the Khmer Rouge army and political organization be
dismantled. Sihanouk says the Khmer Rouge will continue fighting
unless it is allowed into a transitional coalition government.
   However, the claimed Vietnamese pullout will focus greater
attention on resolving this question. And more than ever, the Khmer
Rouge is being pressured by its two strongest backers, China and
Thailand.
   For the first time since Vietnam's invasion, three Chinese
officials visited Cambodia for economic talks earlier this year, an
indication Beijing is keeping its options open.
   And at Pailin and elsewhere, the Thai army has halted artillery
support for the Khmer Rouge and cleared out some of its military
bases and secretive civilian camps, officials said.
   Hanoi hopes its pullout will end the Western economic blockades
that have made Vietnam worse off than the country it occupied.
   Its retreat from Cambodia coincides with declining Soviet
influence in both countries and could begin a strategic realignment
favoring the non-Communist world, diplomats say.

<HEAD>Phase-out of Subsidies Could Help US Corn Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study by the Agriculture Department
suggests that a phase-out of worldwide farm subsidies and trade
barriers could put American corn farmers in an even stronger
position to dominate international trade in coarse grains.
   Nearly three-fourths of the world's coarse grains _ corn,
barley, sorghum, oats and rye _ are grown in the United States,
Soviet Union, European Economic Community, China and Eastern Europe.
   The United States alone produces about 30 percent of the total,
mostly as corn, which as a livestock ``feed grain'' is the main
ingredient for producing meat, poultry and dairy products for
American consumers.
   One of the U.S. goals in the current Uruguay Round of
negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is to
eventually eliminate agricultural trade barriers, including
subsidies that would impair free trade.
   The report, one of a series by the department's Economic
Research Service, is in the October issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine.
   ``While there are adjustment costs involved in moving away from
protectionism, both theory and research results suggest that the
benefits of free trade outweigh the costs,'' the report said. ``But
because there never has been free trade in agriculture, the
findings in these articles are, of necessity, speculative.''
   If the move toward free trade is successful, it ``would push up
the volume of world coarse grain trade and increase grain prices,''
the report said.
   ``U.S. exports likely would increase in response to rising
demand,'' the report said. ``In turn, market receipts for U.S.
producers would go up as world prices rose.''
   However, it added, total returns to farmers would decline,
including losses in government payments _ unless some kind of
``decoupled'' income support was provided.
   Coarse grain production in the United States would probably
increase as much of the land idled under annual federal acreage
programs returned to production, the report said. And U.S.
livestock producers would likely boost output to help fill a rising
world demand for meat.
   ``World meat consumption would go up as the EEC and Japan
removed trade barriers, which would lower their domestic consumer
meat prices,'' the report said. ``More U.S. livestock production
would boost the demand for U.S. coarse grains.''
   As a result of a move away from protectionism, world coarse
grain production ``would shift away from inefficient producers to
more efficient ones,'' the report said. That would occur within
individual countries as well as around the world.
   ``The U.S., Argentina and Thailand, all efficient producers,
probably would increase output,'' the report said. ``However,
production likely would decline in the EEC, Japan and Taiwan.''
   Over the long haul, coarse grain production probably would
increase because of the rise in world livestock prices. The report
assumed that the rise in meat demand and prices would be triggered
by a growing population and rising incomes, particularly in the
Third World.
   ``Because of lower domestic coarse grain prices, EEC farmers
probably would reduce production,'' the report said. ``But the size
of the adjustment would depend on how relative prices changed and
how much land went out of production.''
   Livestock producers in the EEC would increase their feed
demands, which could force the 12-nation trading bloc into becoming
a net importer of coarse grains once again.
   China, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe _ the other major
producers of coarse grains _ probably will not participate in this
round of GATT trade reform, the report said.
   As it is now, the United States, EEC, Argentina, Canada, China,
Australia, Thailand and South Africa account for more than 90
percent of the world's coarse grain exports. The U.S. share was 55
percent in the 1985-87 period.
   Some of the major exporters also are importers, and there have
been shifts. For example, the report said, since 1985 the EEC and
China have changed from being net importers to net exporters.
   The biggest coarse grain importers include Japan, EEC, Soviet
Union, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan, Eastern Europe and
Mexico. These account for nearly three-fourths of the world total
coarse grain imports.

   Thousands of miles of track cast off by the
big railroad companies are a growing part of the rural
transportation network as local or regional systems, says an
Agriculture Department report.
   Martin ``Buzz'' Fitzpatrick, administrator of the department's
Office of Transportation, said Tuesday the number and mileage of
small railroads began to increase in the 1970s but gained a full
head of steam in the mid-1980s.
   ``However, future growth in the local and regional railroad
movement probably will be determined by the outcome of court
rulings as to the rights of rail labor in branch line sales and in
transactions that create new railroads,'' he said.
   Since the Staggers Act of 1980, which eased the way for the big
companies to sell off unprofitable branch lines, nearly 200 new
small railroads have been formed, the report said. A fifth of these
are owned by shippers.
   ``Local and regional railroads now operate over approximately 15
percent of the nation's rail system, or 30,000 miles, and employ
30,000 people,'' the report said. ``Last year, these carriers
generated $1.5 billion in revenues.''
   Small railroads include local freight lines that earn less than
$20 million annually and operate less than 350 miles of track.
Regional freight lines earn between $20 million and $87 million
annually and operate at least 350 miles of track.
   The report said that as much as 25,000 additional miles of rail
line is expected to be cast off by the bigger Class I railroads
before they are finished with restructuring plans. Eighteen
thousand miles are to be sold to small railroads over the next two
years.

   The setting for President Bush's
education summit this week is the University of Virginia, the
``academical village'' that Thomas Jefferson founded in the serene
foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains as an experiment in learning.
   Jefferson wanted to avoid the usual ``large and common den of
noise'' at other universities, but whether Bush and the nation's
governors respect Jefferson's wishes will be evident when they
convene today.
   The purpose of the two-day summit, a major Bush initiative, is
to look for ways to improve American public education. Jefferson
also was searching for something different _ and better _ in higher
education.
   The third U.S. president and squire of nearby Monticello, where
Bush and the governors will dine during the summit, Jefferson
sought a new kind of learning environment at his university.
   Rather than building a single huge structure, Jefferson
envisioned a campus of small classroom dwellings where professors
and students would live closely together as a community of scholars.
   Such a concept, he wrote, would amount to ``an academical
village, instead of a large and common den of noise, of filth and
of fetid air.''
   Jefferson also redirected the focus of higher education toward
public service and practical matters, and away from the university
as a training academy for clergymen and academics.
   The university received its charter from the state in 1819 and
opened with 68 students and a faculty of eight in 1825. It has
grown to an enrollment of 17,000 undergraduates and 6,000 graduate
students today, but still preserves much of its Jeffersonian
heritage.
   Students still live on the Lawn designed by Jefferson, four
colonnaded rows of rooms reserved for selected applicants. Claiming
an address on the Lawn is regarded as a high honor, even though
residents must walk outside on winter mornings to reach the
bathroom.
   At the end of the Lawn is the Rotunda, a former library and
classroom building which Jefferson modeled after the Roman
Pantheon. It is now reserved for important meetings such as the
Bush summit.
   If Bush or the governors refer to the ``campus'' here, they will
be wrong. According to Jeffersonian tradition, it is called the
Grounds. And students are first-year, second-year and so on,
instead of freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors.
   Bush is following Jefferson's example in wanting to be known as
``the education president,'' says Jennings L. Wagoner, a university
professor who is an expert on Jefferson's educational views.
   Jefferson saw education as a national priority that required
federal leadership, Wagoner said, and believed that carrying out
those priorities was the responsibility of state and local
governments.
   Most of the university's students are likely to regard the
summit as a sideshow causing only minor inconvenience, such as
cancellation of boxing and weightlifting classes because of the
gymnasium's conversion into a press center.
   Nonetheless, some students are keenly interested in the summit.
   ``I think it's exciting that the 51 most important
administrators in the country are meeting here,'' said Jim Greiner,
a junior who is studying government.
   Greiner said summits tend to be ``exercises in press relations''
where no real work is accomplished. What really matters here, he
said, is how much money Bush is willing to pump into the schools.
   ``If Bush wants to be known as the education president, he will
have to restructure his spending priorities,'' Greiner said. ``When
people say `what has he done for education,' he can point to the
conference as a positive step. But the bottom line is money.''

<HEAD>Bus Operators Say Access for Disabled Would End Some Bus Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intercity bus service operators say attempts
to open all buses to disabled Americans will instead mean the end
of public transportation for many rural areas and the poor.
   Bus operators from Greyhound down to small regional carriers
told a House subcommittee Tuesday that the proposed Americans With
Disabilities Act unfairly singles them out with its requirement
that all buses be equipped with wheelchair lifts.
   No other segment of the transportation industry would be told
how to make vehicles accessible, and none are being told to make
every vehicle accessible, bus operators said.
   ``The mandatory lift requirement with its attendant costs,
including installation ... would spell the end of intercity service
in the United States,'' Frank M. Henry of the American Bus
Association told the House Public Works and Transportation surface
transportation subcommittee.
   ``Rural communities now served only by intercity bus would have
no public transportation available,'' he said. ``Customers now
served, many of whom are young, old, and poor and who have no other
means of transportation, would be stranded.''
   Advocates for the disabled say many handicapped people are poor
and live in the country, so it is essential they have access to
intercity buses.
   ``Without access to transportation, all the other things the act
provides don't matter,'' said Tim Cook, director of the
Washington-based National Disability Center.
   The act guarantees a broad range of rights to the nation's
estimated 43 million disabled. Estimates by various groups at the
hearing were that anywhere from 760,000 to 1.7 million of those
disabled use wheelchairs.
   Fred G. Currey, head of Dallas-based Greyhound Bus Lines Inc.,
said 50 percent of the company's passengers earn less than $15,000
a year. Even a slight increase in ticket costs due to the act would
price many passengers out of a ticket, he said.
   The company would have to cut service to up to half its 10,000
communities, and companies that operate feeder lines would have to
do the same.
   The bus operators propose that service be available on demand.
Advocates of the disabled say this violates the intent of the bill,
since the disabled have the same right to spontaneous travel that
others have.
   The disabled advocates also say the intercity bus services are
treated more leniently because of compromises in the version of the
bill passed earlier this month by the Senate.
   The Senate bill gives the bus industry six to seven years to
comply, longer than anyone else, they say. They also say that
wheelchair lifts are not the only way to provide access, although
the lifts have been the main item of discussion in testimony on the
legislation.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Report Card Includes Many Incompletes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush may be fulfilling one campaign
promise with his education summit that begins today, but his
overall report card at this point would bear a lot of incompletes.
   Any compilation of the president's record _ eight months into
his first year _ would show movement on dozens of campaign pledges
but final action on only a few, particularly in the domestic arena.
   In fact, many of Bush's first-term initiatives are caught in a
colossal congressional logjam just days before the start of fiscal
year 1990.
   The president did score some impressive victories in recent days
on the foreign policy front, including his well-received U.N.
initiative to limit chemical weapons and an array of Soviet
concessions on arms control issues.
   And a Senate deadlock over funding Bush's war on drugs appeared
to be broken with White House acceptance of a compromise plan.
   Still, the bulk of Bush's domestic proposals to Congress _
nearly all of them reflecting campaign promises _ appeared to be
languishing.
   And then there are the Bush ``summits.''
   The two-day conference of the nation's governors _ today and
Thursday in Charlottesville, Va. _ is just one of five separate
summits Bush, the candidate, said he would call in his first year.
   Only one other has actually been held, last May's summit of
North Atlantic Treaty Organization members. But that coincided with
NATO's 40th anniversary celebration and was not specifically
arranged by the United States.
   Another summit is said to be in the planning stage, although no
date or location has yet been set: a Latin American summit on drug
trafficking.
   Bush also proposed an international summit on global warming, to
be held in Washington and to include the Soviet Union, China and
developing nations as well as western industrial nations.
   But little has been heard on that subject since he took office.
   Also proposed but not heard from again: Devoting a seven-nation
economic summit to agriculture.
   The president has a better track record on submitting items on
his 1988 campaign agenda to Congress. But the bulk of them are now
bogged down in the Democratic-controlled House and Senate.
   For instance, on education, subject of today's summit, Bush last
spring proposed a $414 million package that included a $250 million
proposal for national merit scholarship and $100 million for magnet
schools.
   But the only part of Bush's package to make any headway in
either chamber to date is a relatively modest math and science
scholarship program, which has passed the House.
   Bush's proposal to overhaul the Clean Air Act, following up on
campaign pledges to be the environmental president as well as the
education president, is creeping along. House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., recently said House action on it this year is unlikely.
   Bush's proposal for child care and adoption tax credits are also
in congressional limbo, and his proposal to reduce the capital
gains tax is now the subject of fierce partisan wrangling.
   The president vowed anew on Tuesday to fight for the lower rate,
even if it means prolonging an impasse that threatens to trigger
automatic spending cuts next month.
   Chances seem good that fiscal 1990 will begin without agreement
on deficit-reduction legislation to which the capital gains issue
is tied.
   A variety of other Bush proposals, including much of his
anti-crime package, also are making little headway.
   One problem, suggested political analyst Norman Ornstein at the
conservative American Enterprise Institute, is that Bush may have
waited too long, allowing the mythical ``first 100 days'' to elapse
before submitting many of his proposals.
   ``We did not have the usual pattern of a new president coming in
and having a package of items being ready to go,'' Ornstein said.
``After all, for months we were saying, `is he ever going to
propose anything?'''
   Now, ``It means more than our usual share of chaos'' as a new
fiscal year is about to begin ``without a budget, without a great
sense of direction,'' he added.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, also contended Bush dumped too many initiatives on
Congress at once _ without suggesting how he would pay for them all.
   ``It's kind of the free lunch approach to dealing with national
issues,'' Panetta said.
   Then there are some Bush campaign pledges that haven't yet
surfaced.
   For instance: his proposal for Individual Savings Account, a
plan under which Americans could stash away up to $2,000 a year and
not pay taxes on the interest until the account matured, after five
years or so.
   When Bush unveiled the plan it was immediately ridiculed by
Democrats, who challenged GOP campaign aides to explain how it
differed significantly from U.S. savings bonds.
   They couldn't. And that was the last heard about it.

<HEAD>Public Citizen Says More Oversight of Doctors Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of physicians hit with serious
disciplinary actions is increasing, but it is still too easy for
doctors to get away with negligent practices, a public interest
health group said today.
   There were 1,495 physicians who had their medical licenses
revoked or suspended or who were put on probation by their state
medical licensing board in 1987, a 17 percent increase over the
previous year, said a Public Citizen Health Research Group report.
   Public Citizen said that's nearly three serious disciplinary
actions for every 1,000 U.S. doctors, but that it's not enough.
   ``A physician could still operate drunk, commit a gross act of
negligence or sexually assault a patient and receive a mere slap on
the wrist from his or her state's medical board in most states,''
the group's report said.
   Public Citizen estimates more than 100,000 Americans are injured
or killed each year because of physicians' negligence.
   ``The absence in most states of the maximum effort to discipline
these doctors is one of the most serious threats to the health of
American patients,'' the report said.
   Public Citizen, a public interest group associated with Ralph
Nader, began tabulating the actions of the state medical boards in
1984, when it found 745 serious disciplinary actions _ revocation,
suspension or probation. In 1985, boards took 1,089 actions, a 46
percent increase from the previous year. That rose by 17 percent to
1,277 in 1986.
   The report attributes the increase to ``a spate of adverse
publicity and state and federal legislation.'' During 1987 and
1988, 44 state legislatures strengthened state oversight of
physicians, the group said.
   The group praised the efforts of West Virginia, which had the
highest rate of serious disciplinary actions against doctors in
1987. The state's medical board ordered serious disciplinary
actions at the rate of eight physicians per 1,000, Public Citizen
said.
   Kansas had the lowest rate, about one per 2,000, according to
the group's analysis.
   ``Until the rate of doctor discipline in this country
significantly increases, there is no realistic possibility of a
major decrease in the amount of medical malpractice,'' said Public
Citizen.
   The group recommends raising doctors' licensing fees to $500 per
year to finance doctor disciplinary actions and reduce the backlogs
that plague many state medical boards.
   Public Citizen also recommends periodic recertification of
physicians, giving state boards broader authority to evaluate
doctors and take action against them and requiring insurance
companies to rate doctors so those with the best records pay the
lowest premiums.

<HEAD>Initial Effort to Tighten Auto Emissions Standards Fails</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House members who want stricter auto emissions
standards say they won't let an initial defeat prevent another bid
to toughen President Bush's clean air bill.
   Administration opponents on the Energy and Commerce environment
subcommittee failed Tuesday to amend the bill, as they sought to
make auto requirements far tougher than those in smog-choked
California.
   Panel Chairman Henry A. Waxman's plan lost on a voice vote, but
the California Democrat said his forces would make another attempt
_ possibly today, when the subcommittee considers more amendments
to the administration plan.
   ``Many didn't want to go with our provisions,'' he said, but
predicted some members might support ``a middle-ground, something
like the California standards.''
   California has the toughest auto pollution requirements in the
country, exceeding federal requirements for the rest of the nation,
because its ozone problem is so serious.
   Motor vehicle emissions are a prime source of ozone, although
some pollutants also contribute to the other problems the bill is
trying to address: acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals.
   Ozone is a highly reactive gas that is the prime ingredient of
smog, a term coined by combining smoke and fog. Ozone is produced
by the combination of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides in the
presence of sunlight and heat. Both gases are produced from mobile
sources _ cars, trucks and buses _ but also from stationary sources
_ major industrial plants, such as utilities, and some small
businesses.
   The outgunned Waxman, who is closely allied with environmental
organizations, conceded defeat without requesting a roll call.
   ``Sometimes you don't want them on record so they can rethink
their position and come around,'' said Waxman, who can renew his
proposal in the full Energy and Commerce Committee and the House
floor if he loses in subcommittee. The Senate has not begun
amending clean air legislation.
   Rep. Norman F. Lent, R-N.Y., the main GOP sponsor of the Bush
legislation, said Waxman's proposals would have cost consumers an
extra $500 per car if fully implemented by model year 2000. For
that expense, he said pollution under Waxman's plan would only be
cut an additional 2.7 percent compared to the Bush proposal.
   Motor vehicles are mainly responsible for ozone pollution,
although some emissions also release toxic chemicals and a
component of acid rain.
   Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., said he supported Waxman's plan in
order to ``send ... the right kind of signal'' to the auto industry
and the public: that Congress backs ``the strictest limits.''
   But he added, ``We don't know where those numbers are going to
lead us.''
   The latter point was made repeatedly by Lent, who said the
technology doesn't exist to meet the Waxman standards, but only is
alive in ``the dreams of the authors'' of the amendment. ``Even
California is smart enough not to adopt these standards,'' he
argued.
   Waxman's plan would have limited hydrocarbon emissions to 0.25
grams per mile from 1993 through 1999, and 0.125 grams per mile
after that.
   Nitrogen oxides, an ingredient of acid rain, would have been
capped at 0.4 grams per mile from 1993-99, and 0.2 grams afterward.
   Carbon monoxide, a toxic pollutant, was set at 3.4 grams per
mile from 1992-99 _ retaining current law _ and 1.7 grams afterward
under the Waxman proposal.
   The Bush standard for hydrocarbons is 0.25 grams per mile by
1998; for nitrogen oxides, 0.7 grams by the same year; and
retention of the current 3.4 gram carbon monoxide limit.
   California's limits for hydrocarbons starting in 1995 will be
0.25 grams per mile for 50,000 miles and 0.31 grams between 50,000
and 100,000 miles.
   The state's nitrogen oxide limit, already in effect, is 0.4
grams up to 50,000 miles. The carbon monoxide standard now is 3.4
grams but rises to 4.2 between 50,000 and 100,000 miles.
   Current federal law outside California requires car limits of
0.41 grams per mile for hydrocarbons, 1 gram for nitrogen oxides
and 3.4 grams for carbon monoxide.

   The indictment of defense consultant
Thomas E. Muldoon will likely send prosecutors investigating
Pentagon procurement fraud to trial for the second time in the
3-year-old probe.
   All but two of the 23 individuals convicted in the ``Ill Wind''
case have pleaded guilty, but Muldoon's lawyer said Tuesday that
Muldoon has already turned down a government offer to plead guilty
and denies charges that he participated in a scheme to bribe a
Marine Corps procurement official.
   ``Muldoon denies it all, denies there was any criminal intent on
his part at any time,'' Albert J. Ahern Jr. said. ``His position
from the very beginning is that he denied any bribery, therefore he
isn't going to plea to that.''
   Court documents portray Muldoon as a major figure in the defense
procurement scandal, operating in a network of people who got
secret information on contracts from Pentagon sources and sold it
to companies seeking the military contracts.
   He was charged Tuesday after two former executives of Whittaker
Command and Control Systems, and the corporate unit itself, pleaded
guilty to participating in the bribery scheme with Muldoon.
   Scott M. Lamberth, the subsidiary's former president, and John
F. Van Tassel, once director of its Fayetteville, Ark., operations,
said they funneled more than $80,000 in bribes to Marine Corps
procurement official Jack Sherman through Muldoon and two other
defense consultants, John Marlowe and Donald Illeman.
   Marlowe is the government's original informant who led
investigators to Sherman, who pleaded guilty to taking other bribes
and received an 18-month sentence.
   According to court papers filed Tuesday, the bribery scheme
began with a private company called Lee Telecommunications, which
Whittaker Corp. purchased in 1986 and made a subsidiary.
   In 1981, Lee Telecommunications arranged, through Muldoon, to
bribe Sherman to help obtain a contract to provide an electronics
component for a battlefield air traffic control system being
developed by the Marines, according to the court papers.
   Over seven years, Lee paid $200,000 to Marlowe, Muldoon and
Illeman, who shared their fees with Sherman, prosecutors say.
   The Marine Corps official then authorized modifications in the
company's contracts that brought their total value to $7.7 million.
   Indicted with Muldoon on Tuesday was Leonard L. Ingram, former
vice president of Lee Telecommunications, and later of the
Whittaker Command subsidiary.
   Ingram's attorney, Marcus Topel, said Ingram also wanted to
stand trial.
   ``I think this is a classic case of guilt by association,'' the
San Francisco lawyer said. ``I think the trial will show he had
absolutely nothing to do with any of these wrongful activities, and
at most was present at various times when they were discussed and
did nothing further than that.''
   In the only other jury trial resulting from the investigation,
two Teledyne Electronics executives were convicted last spring of
conspiracy and wire fraud but were cleared of charges they
participated in a separate bribery scheme.
   The guilty plea by the Whittaker subsidiary is the third by a
corporation in the case.
   Teledyne Industries and Hazeltine Corp. pleaded guilty in
connection with their roles in the procurement scandal.
   The Whittaker subsidiary agreed to pay $3.5 million in fines and
penalties. According to court papers, Lamberth deliberately
withheld information about the bribery scheme from Whittaker Corp.
officials in Los Angeles.
   Company attorney Daniel H. Bookin told U.S. District Judge
Claude Hilton Whittaker officials in Los Angeles were unaware of
the scheme. ``No one who is involved in those activities is
currently with the company,'' he said.

<HEAD>Safety Board Blames Pilot, Co-Pilot, But Not Second Officer in Delta
Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety officials are blaming the pilot
and co-pilot, but not the third man in the cockpit, for a Delta
Airlines crash at Dallas-Fort Worth airport that killed 14 people.
   The Aug. 18, 1988, crash was caused by a lack of cockpit
discipline, the crew's attempt to take off with wing flaps and
slats in the wrong position, and failure of an alarm system to warn
that something was wrong, the National Transportation Safety Board
concluded Tuesday.
   The board laid secondary blame on Delta for sloppy cockpit
procedures and training and on the Federal Aviation Administration
for failing to correct Delta's known deficiencies.
   Board staff members, who conducted the year-long investigation,
said Delta has since corrected the deficiencies.
   Board member James Burnett dissented from the decision, saying
the conclusion let Delta off too easily by citing it only for slow
correction of problems during a period of rapid growth and merger.
He also said the board should have laid more direct blame on FAA
failures.
   ``The responsibility here lies as much with the FAA and Delta as
it does with the crew,'' said Burnett.
   ``I couldn't be more strongly opposed to that view,'' said James
Kolstad, acting board chairman, who pushed to leave out any
criticism of the FAA in the final statement.
   Delta conceded in July that errors by its flight crew in failing
to set the Boeing 727's flaps and slats in the proper takeoff
position led to the crash.
   A Delta official attending the board meeting declined to comment
on the board's decision.
   The airliner, taking off with more than 100 people on a flight
for Salt Lake City, was piloted by Captain Larry L. Davis, 48, with
First Officer Carey W. Kirkland, 37, and Second Officer Steven Mark
Judd, 30, in the cockpit.
   Delta fired all three cockpit crew members when the company
accepted responsibility for the crash.
   The board's assessment of probable cause did not include actions
by Judd, who board members said was the only pilot to perform
professionally during the takeoff.
   They noted that Judd failed to report a malfunctioning warning
light but said monitoring the light was not his specific
responsibility and he was performing all of his other duties.
   Board members, in discussing the accident which destroyed the
Boeing jetliner, criticized the presence of a flight attendant in
the cockpit for 18 minutes just before the takeoff. The board said
Davis and Kirkland engaged in idle conversation when they should
have been attending to takeoff preparations.
   The board viewed computer animations of the plane's flaps-down
takeoff as its tail and a wing clipped the runway. The animations,
prepared by the safety board staff, also showed that the plane
could have taken off safely if the captain had applied full
throttle once he realized there was a problem getting lift, but he
failed to do so.
   The plane plowed into the ground beyond the runway and burst
into flames. First reports from the control tower indicated the
crash was ``non-survivable,'' but more than 90 people crawled out
of the wreckage and survived.
   The board concluded that the jetliner's takeoff warning system
had an intermittent failure problem which was not corrected during
its last maintenance and occurred again during the crash of Flight
1141.
   The board, whose conclusions carry no force of law, recommended
that the FAA check the cockpit procedures employed by carriers and
develop improvements in takeoff warning systems.
   It also called for a government-industry task force to make
rules for establishing flight safety programs at major airlines.
   The Air Line Pilots Association criticized the board for
stressing actions by the pilots rather than the malfunctioning
takeoff warning system.
   The group said the board's conclusion that the pilots failed to
set the flaps ``is based largely on circumstantial evidence.''

   Millicent Fenwick recalls a conversation with
President Ronald Reagan during a flight from Washington to New
Jersey when she promoted a proposal to develop an elderly housing
complex in a town called Ewing.
   On the ground later, Reagan told a rally for Fenwick's 1982
Senate campaign that the Department of Housing and Urban
Development would fund the project, the former GOP congresswoman
said Tuesday.
   ``I was absolutely stunned when he said that,'' she said in a
telephone interview. ``Given the events we're hearing about today
it makes me feel badly, but at the time it seemed so innocent.''
   Reagan's decision to award subsidies to the New Jersey project
forced HUD to withdraw a commitment to fund a North Carolina
project, a Democratic lawmaker said in contending Reagan used the
agency to boost Mrs. Fenwick's unsuccessful campaign.
   ``I can't seen how it could be any more political,'' said Rep.
Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., contending the example showed HUD how
political favoritism permeated HUD during the Reagan administration.
   Lantos made the charge at a hearing at which former HUD
Secretary Samuel Pierce invoked his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination to refuse to answer to answer questions about
his eight-year tenure.
   The project that lost its funding to the New Jersey facility now
figures prominently in questions about Pierce's conduct at HUD. The
converted hosiery mill in Durham, N.C., was funded five years later
over the objections of agency experts.
   Reagan announced the New Jersey award at a Sept. 17, 1982,
campaign appearance for Fenwick, who said she had failed in 1981 to
convince HUD officials to support the Ewing development.
   The same day Reagan made the announcement, a deputy wrote a memo
to Pierce saying HUD had received a call from the White House.
   ``The president, who is en route to New Jersey, has agreed to
fund, with Section 8 new construction funds,'' the 125-unit housing
project in Ewing, near Trenton, the memo said.
   On the bottom of the memo, the word ``noted'' is scribbled
alongside Pierce's initials.
   The memo, taken from Pierce's files, was released by the
subcommittee.
   Stuart Weisberg, the subcommittee staff director and chief
counsel, said other HUD documents obtained by the panel indicate
HUD, because of Reagan's promise in New Jersey, withdrew a
commitment to provide subsidies to the Durham Hosiery Mill.
   The Durham project was ultimately given more than $11 million in
HUD financing in 1987, despite the objections of agency officials.
   A former Pierce deputy, Shirley Wiseman, told Congress she
refused to sign the funding papers even after Pierce ordered her to
do so. Pierce, in a recent interview with Time magazine, said he
had overruled senior staff to fund the Durham project.
   Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said he was not familiar with the
project cited by Lantos. ``We wouldn't comment on a pending
congressional investigation anyway,'' said Weinberg.

<HEAD>Transportation Employees Test 99 Percent Drug Free</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department says it's
employees responsible for public safety and security are almost 100
percent drug-free.
   Random drug tests on 15,352 department workers _ most of them in
sensitive jobs at the Federal Aviation Administration _ turned up
illegal drug use in 99, the Transportation Department said Monday.
   The 99 positive results were 0.6 percent of the total tests
conducted between Jan. 1, 1988 and April 30, 1989, according to the
department's ``Drug-Free Workplace Program Evaluation Report'' for
   ``Marijuana use accounted 
September 1989.for approximately two-thirds of
positives with cocaine for all but a small percentage of the
rest,'' the report says.
   The department said it spent $4 million on its anti-drug program
in the 1988 fiscal year, which ended last Sept. 30, covering
collection, laboratory testing, staff support and informational
services, according to the report.
   Federal Aviation Administration employees accounted for 95
percent of those tested under the random testing program, which
focuses on safety and security workers who have a direct impact on
public safety, the protection of life and property, law enforcement
or national security.
   Of these employees, 65 percent were air traffic controllers, 16
percent electronic technitment did
drug tests for what it called reasonable suspicion, post-accident
tests and follow-up tests.
   The 26 drug tests taken after accidents in the FAA and two in
the U.S. Coast Guard all turned up negative, the report said.
   Of the 17 reasonable suspicion tests during the 16-month period
cited in the report, nine showed negative results.

<HEAD>Baker Asks for Funds to Defeat Ortega</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is using
his meetings here with foreign ministers to appeal for private
contributions to defeat Daniel Ortega, the Sandinista president of
Nicaragua, U.S. officials say.
   He made the request of the foreign ministers of Japan and West
Germany on Tuesday ``and he did make it with others,'' the
officials said in confirming a Japanese report.
   Baker did not specify how much of a contribution the Bush
administration wanted for Violeta Chamorro, the newspaper publisher
who is running against Ortega, and he was given no commitments by
the ministers, said the officials, who demanded anonymity.
   Last week Baker abandoned a plan to have the National Endowment
for Democracy make contributions to Mrs. Chamorro's campaign to
defeat Ortega in next year's presidential election in Nicaragua.
   Baker concluded such use of the group went beyond its
congressional charter. The National Endowment for Democracy will
participate in poll watching, as it has done in Panama, Chile and
other countries.
   Appealing to the foreign ministers to arrange private
contributions ``was something that was suggested by some members of
the Democratic leadership when we talked with them about NED
funding,'' an official said.
   Baker asked Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayana to use his
influence with the Liberal Democratic Party to obtain contributions
for Mrs. Chamorro's campaign, the officials said.
   Baker made an indirect approach also to Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
the West German foreign minister, at a separate meeting, the
officials said.
   The Free Democrats have ties to one political institute, and the
Christian Democrats to another one.
   ``It's an effort that we are making and an effort that we will
pursue,'' the official said.
   ``It wasn't just funds,'' said another U.S. official. ``This
came up in several meetings. He also has encouraged people, if they
wished, to send election observers to have visits down there. So it
wasn't just funds.''
   Baker is in New York to attend the special session of the United
Nations General Assembly. But he is spending most of the week
meeting with dozens of foreign ministers here for the session.
   Baker also met Tuesday with Foreign Ministers Krzysztof
Skubiszewski of Poland and Gyuia Horn of Hungary.
   The U.S. officials said the Pole outlined a ``major overhaul''
of the East European country's monetary policy and economic
structure.
   ``We're very pleased to see that, because we see it as moving in
the direction that we had set out from the very start, which is to
try and build an effective private sector to try and deal with
problems,'' an official said.
   The plan, he said, is designed to cope with inflation, now about
40 percent a month, and to promote private enterprise.
   The program impressed Baker and his aides, but the officials
declined to say whether it would cause the Bush administration to
increase aid to Poland.
   President Bush has asked Congress for $119 million in
developmental assistance. Last week, bowing to pressure from
Congress, an additional $50 million in food aid was tacked on.
   Still, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led by the
Democrats, approved a nearly $1.2 billion three-year aid package
for Poland and Hungary.
   ``I think from the outline of what we've seen it's a very
positive development,'' the official said of the Polish program.

   Two more tests of the B-2 bomber have been cut
short, once because of high winds and another time because of
another oil pressure problem, according to the Pentagon.
   A Sept. 21 flight was scrubbed after three hours after
indications of low oil pressure in the plane's No. 1 airframe
accessory drive, said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams. A similar
problem had forced cancellation of a flight on Aug. 16.
   A flight Saturday ended after 77 minutes ``because of gusty
winds at the altitude at which the plane was flying,'' William
said, adding that he could not say what the wind strengths were.
   The bat-winged bomber is designed to pass through enemy radar
virtually undetected. The accessory drive is the gear box that
powers the jet's generators and controls.
   The government has spent about $22.4 billion in the B-2 program,
which is 18 months behind schedule, and Congress has balked at
paying more than $500 million each for 132 bombers.

<HEAD>Discovery Offers Hope for Better Treatment of Lung Cancer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A genetic abnormality that appears to play a
role in many common cancers has been solidly linked to lung cancer,
raising hopes of improved diagnosis and treatment, scientists say.
   Researchers examining lung cancer tumors discovered a series of
abnormalities in the so-called p53 anti-cancer gene, according to a
report Tuesday by Dr. John Minna of the National Cancer
Institute-Navy Medical Oncology Branch in Bethesda, Md.
   Defects in the gene also have been linked to colon cancer, to an
uncommon bone cancer called osteogenic sarcoma and to chronic
myelogenous leukemia, Minna said.
   ``Obviously, everybody is going to be looking for it in
everything else,'' Minna said.
   Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who
identified p53 abnormalities in colon cancer, said: ``From what
I've heard of Dr. Minna's work, it seems quite clear that the p53
gene will play an important role in lung tumors.
   ``Current evidence suggests that p53 is likely to play a role in
many common cancers,'' including breast cancer, ovarian cancer and
bladder cancer, he said.
   During the past few years, researchers have found indirect
evidence that defects in at least six genes can contribute to lung
cancer, which afflicts an estimated 150,000 Americans a year.
   The new study has pinpointed chemical changes in one of those
genes. That should be useful for identifying people at high risk of
getting lung cancer, or for predicting how deadly a particular case
of lung cancer will be, Minna said.
   ``One thing you could do would be to take people's tumors, see
how many (genetic) lesions they have, and determine how virulent
they are,'' Minna said Tuesday in a telephone interview from
Toronto, where he presented his findings at the Bristol-Myers
Cancer Research Symposium.
   Vogelstein has found that the more genetic abnormalities a colon
cancer tumor has, the more virulent it is, Minna said.
   Minna said he is beginning studies to determine if the same
thing is true in lung cancer.
   Determination of a tumor's virulence could lead to better
decisions on treatment, he said.
   Minna also said screening for genetic abnormalities in people
who don't have lung cancer could reveal those who are about to get
cancer _ that is, people who have some, but not all, of the genetic
changes needed to produce a tumor. Such people could be followed
closely for the appearance of tumors, he said.
   The protein made by the p53 gene, located on chromosome 17,
normally protects the body against cancer. If the protein is
defective, the protective effect is lost and one step has been
taken toward the formation of a tumor, Minna explained. The gene is
called an anti-cancer gene because it normally protects against
cancer.
   Minna said that although only six genetic abnormalities have so
far been linked to lung cancer, there may be as many as 10 or 20.
   Most of the evidence for the six abnormalities already found
consists of studies with genetic ``signposts'' called restriction
fragment length polymorphisms. These studies show the approximate
location of the abnormalities on chromosomes, but do not reveal
precisely what the abnormalities are.
   The p53 gene is the second anti-cancer gene to be carefully
studied, Minna said. The first was a gene identified in
retinoblastoma, a rare children's eye cancer. The retinoblastoma
gene also was shown recently to be important in lung cancer, Minna
said.

   Singer Bobby Vinton said the 1986
movie ``Blue Velvet'' could have put him on the comeback trail but
he wasn't able to get his his version of the title song re-released.
   Vinton said Roy Orbison gained newfound popularity after his
label re-released his ``In Dreams,'' which also was featured in the
movie about a young man's look at the seamier side of his small
town.
   Orbison went on to record three other albums, one as a
``Traveling Wilbury'' with Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, George Harrison
and Jeff Lynne, before his death earlier this year.
   ``The record company didn't want to release it before the movie
came out,'' Vinton said of his song ``Blue Velvet.''
   ``Then when the the movie became successful they decided to put
it back out. But (director) David Lynch didn't want deal with it
then. He said he didn't want to make a video using outtakes to sell
his movie. He was up for an Academy Award and didn't want to be too
commercial.''
   ``But the way Roy Orbison's career came back it would have been
a good shot for me,'' he said. ``It could have been a moneymaker.''
   Vinton, who is appearing at Harrah's Marina Hotel Casino this
weekend, has returned to Nashville, where he originally recorded
the 1960's hits ``Blue Velvet'' and ``Roses are Red,'' for his
latest album, ``Timeless.''

   A Palestinian-American accused of participating
in a deadly terrorist attack on a bus in Israel should be
extradited to the Jewish state to face trial, a federal judge ruled.
   Mahmoud El-Abed Ahmad, 36, hasn't been charged in the United
States, but has been imprisoned nearly 2{ years while attorneys
argued whether he would get a fair trial in Israel.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein ruled Tuesday that Ahmad
should be extradited, but then delayed the order for 10 days to
allow an appeal.
   American and Israeli authorities say Ahmad played a major part
in a 1986 firebomb and machine gun attack on a bus, killing four
Israelis.
   Ahmad's lawyer, former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, said
Ahmad did not participate in the attack but was implicated by two
cousins after they were tortured by Israeli security agents.
   In his ruling, Weinstein said Ahmad failed to show he ``would be
subject to procedures or treatment so offensive to our nation's
sense of decency as to obligate the court to block his
extradition.''
   Clark was in Los Angeles on Tuesday and did not immediately
return a call for comment. Clark has said he would appeal if
Weinstein ruled for extradition.
   Weinstein also rejected an argument that the bus attack was a
political act that would exempt Ahmad from extradition.
   ``Were a civilian to detonate a bomb in a peaceful marketplace
or rake peaceful shoppers with a machine gun to make a political
point, this and most civilized countries would not consider such
indiscriminate violence an unpunishable political act,'' Weinstein
said.
   Ahmad, who Israeli authorities sometimes refer to as Mahmoud
Abed Atta, is charged with taking part in an April 12, 1986, attack
in which three terrorists hurled Molotov cocktails and then opened
fire with machine guns on a bus carrying Jewish settlers in the
Occupied West Bank.
   Ahmad, who Israel says is a member of the Abu Nidal Palestinian
terrorist group, was born in the West Bank town of Ramallah and
became a U.S. citizen seven years ago. His last job was working at
his brother's filling station in Puerto Rico.
   According to travel documents, he was visiting his family in the
West Bank at the time of the attack, but he denies involvement.
   He was arrested upon entering Venezuela in April 1987. That
country did not have an extradition treaty with Israel and he was
handed over to U.S. authorities. Clark said that was illegal.

<HEAD>Soviet Hails U.S. Chemical Weapons Ideas; Calls for End to Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze has hailed President Bush's call for the superpowers
to destroy most of their chemical weapons, but says Washington
should go further and agree to stop making all types of poison gas.
   In his speech Tuesday to the General Assembly, Shevardnadze also
challenged the United States to join the Soviets in halting all
nuclear tests and ending the production of weapons-grade plutonium
and uranium.
   Shevardnadze's address was a rapid reply to Bush's offer, in a
speech to the assembly on Monday, to cut U.S. chemical weapons
stockpiles by 80 percent if the Soviets reduce their arsenal to the
same level.
   The Soviet envoy said Moscow is ready to join the United States
and ``radically reduce or completely destroy'' all its chemical
weapons even before an international treaty is adopted.
   He said the Soviets had stopped producing some chemical weapons
already, and challenged Washington to do the same:
   ``Cease the production of chemical weapons, as we have done
already. I am referring also to binary weapons,'' said
Shevardnadze. Binary weapons are harmless until two chemicals are
combined just prior to use of the gas shell.
   Congress has approved funds to continue production of binary
poison gas bombs and shells.
   Viktor P. Karpov, the Soviet Union's chief arms control expert,
said ``It will not be sufficient only to get rid of old weapons if
the United States is going to produce new chemical weapons.''
   It was not clear from Shevardnadze's address whether Soviet
cooperation with a weapons cut hinged on Washington agreeing to end
poison gas production. The speech seemed deliberately vague on that
point.
   At White House, Bush said Tuesday: ``The reaction from the
Soviets to our proposals yesterday has been positive, so now the
goal is to get moving and try to work out these agreements.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called
Shevardnadze's statements ``a very constructive response. Our
ultimate objective is total elimination of chemical weapons. And it
appears that both nations are now ready to act.''
   Bush's proposal is intended to spur a 40-nation conference in
Geneva to ban all chemical weapons within 10 years.
   The Soviets would have to scrap more poison gas, as U.S.
officials contend Moscow has far greater stockpiles than Washington
_ an acknowledged 50,000 tons compared to an estimated 30,000 tons
for the United States.
   Bush proposed a U.S.-Soviet agreement to begin those cuts at
once, while an international treaty is worked out in which the
United States would destroy 98 percent of its chemical weapons over
eight years if the Soviets joined the ban.
   The remaining 2 percent would be destroyed within 10 years if
all nations capable of building such weapons agreed to a total ban.
   Speaking to delegates of 159 nations on Tuesday, Shevardnadze
also said Moscow ``is ready to reinstate its moratorium on all
nuclear explosions any day and hour, if the United States
reciprocates.''
   He said Moscow was considering extending the 1963 Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty to cover underground nuclear explosions.
   In another disarmament proposal, Shevardnadze said that ``if
NATO countries agree to start talks on tactical (short-range)
nuclear weapons, the USSR will respond by further unilateral cuts
in its tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.''
   He also proposed that the production of nuclear fissionable
material for weapons be halted and that the ban be verified.
   The Soviet Union has announced it is halting the production of
enriched uranium.
   The weekend agreement that Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will hold a summit meeting ``shows that we have moved
quite far ahead in solving a number of major bilateral and
international problems,'' Shevardnadze said.
   ``In our view, by the time the summit is held next year in late
spring or early summer, we may have passed the last turn on the
road toward a treaty reducing strategic offensive arms'', or
long-range nuclear missiles, by 50 percent.
   In a speech that praised the right of a people to choose its
government and course of development, Shevardnadze also wished
``every success'' to Poland's new government, the first East bloc
government not led by Communists.
   He pledged to cooperate with it.
   Shevardnadze denounced the ``so-called movements that allow
actions humiliating other nations, or use terrorist, barbaric and
inhuman methods in waging their struggle,'' a pointed reference to
kidnappings by Shiite Moslem extremists in Lebanon and Palestinian
guerrilla attacks on Israel.

<HEAD>Parliament Ends Restrictions On Travel, Takes Up Bill On Free Speech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under a bill being taken up by
Parliament, Hungarians will now be able to speak their mind and
agitate for political and social change without fear of
prosecution, the country's justice minsiter says.
   The amendment to the penal code, to be debated today, is just
another step toward the greater democracy promised by Hungary's
Communist leaders as they prepare for the free elections they have
promised by June.
   The bill is part of a package of legislation now before
Parliament that is designed to prepare the East bloc country for a
multiparty system and bring its laws in line with international
covenants on human rights.
   With Poland, Hungary is taking advantage of Moscow's greater
tolerance to end decades of one-party authoritarian rule.
   As Parliament convened Tuesday, it adopted important new bills
that will liberalize travel and emigration, removing most
restrictions on Hungarians wishing to travel or live abroad.
   Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar told Parliament that ``with the
broadening of civic rights, the penal code must be appropriately
reformed.''
   He said the amendment to be debated today aimed to ``guarantee
greater freedom for political activity.''
   Kulscar said a comprehensive reform of the penal code was under
way but that the amendments now before Parliament addressed certain
``urgent problems'' that could not wait.
   Hungary's rapid liberalization has allowed a degree of free
expression that would have been difficult even one year ago.
   Opposition leaders are now quoted in the official media and, in
most instances, people are permitted to demonstrate freely on a
wide range of issues including such sensitive topics as the
withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   The Communist Party has agreed to relinquish its leading role
and enter into free elections with independent parties, even
pledging to go into opposition if it loses.
   The Communists have also sat down with opposition groups and
parties to work out the transition to a multiparty system and the
country's first free elections in more than 40 years.
   The legislation now before Parliament at this session is partly
a result of agreements reached at those talks.
   Other key bills are to be taken up by Parliament in October.
They will include bills on political parties, electoral law and
changes in the judiciary. A measure on changes in the constitution
will remove references to the leading role of the Communist Party,
officials say.
   The emigration and travel laws adopted Tuesday lifted most
restrictions on travel and guarantee the right of Hungarians to
choose freely their desired place of residence, to leave and return
to their own country.
   Interior Minister Istvan Horvath said Hungarians who had
emigrated for personal or even for political reasons would be
allowed to return at any time.
   He said 19 restrictive measures would be removed when the laws
take effect Jan. 1.
   Hungary's liberal policies on travel have already been
illustrated by the government's decision in May to remove barbed
wire and other barriers along its border with Austria.
   The Budapest leadership angered its hard-line East German,
Czechoslovak and Romanian allies earlier this month when it decided
to open its borders to thousands of East Germans seeking to
emigrate to the West.

<HEAD>Battle Over Teaching Evolution Renewed in California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG WILLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A renewed fight over the teaching of
evolution and creationism in California will have a crucial test
this week in a battle that has national implications.
   The focal point is the upcoming adoption of a new science
curriculum framework, a detailed statement of what should be taught
in California and how it should be taught.
   The framework doesn't mandate course content, which is
determined by the state's 1,030 local school boards, but it sets
standards and goals that historically have been nearly as effective
as mandates.
   In 1985, California education authorities drew national
attention by successfully demanding that publishers devote more
space to evolution. The revised textbooks are now being used in
schools across the nation.
   The new proposal would strengthen the teaching of evolution.
   If adopted, it would be a ``national victory for science over
dogma,'' said Michael Hudson, western states director for the
Washington-based People for the American Way, a 270,000-member
advocacy group for civil and constitutional liberty issues.
   The teaching of evolution is so entrenched in California that
fundamentalist Christians who support creationist theory aren't
trying to exclude it. They hope to persuade the state to recommend
that students hear differing views on evolution.
   ``Material should be included in the textbooks by various
scientists who say that evolution ... cannot be substantiated. If
credible competing views are not discussed, and evolution is spoken
of as a theory with no critical information provided, the textbooks
will present evolution dogmatically,'' said the Rev. Louis Sheldon,
chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, a coalition of 6,000
California churches.
   But Bill Honig, the state superintendent of public instruction
and the major force behind California's drive to strengthen the
teaching of evolution, contends no credible scientific evidence
refutes evolution.
   Honig said evolution belongs in science classes because there is
hard scientific evidence to back it, and creation theory belongs in
philosophy or history classes because it is based on faith and is
part of Western cultural heritage.
   Evolution teaches that the Earth is billions of years old and
that life forms gradually began developing millions of years ago.
   Creation-science is linked closely to a literal translation of
the biblical book of Genesis, teaching that the Earth and most of
its life forms came into existence suddenly more than 5,000 years
ago.
   The science subcommittee of the state Curriculum Commission will
hold its final hearing on the proposed new framework Thursday, with
a vote scheduled Friday. If approved, the state Board of Education
will hold a hearing on it in October and vote in November.
   The proposal, which a panel of 18 prominent educators has been
working on for 1{ years, includes revised recommendations on dozens
of scientific subjects, such as physics and AIDS.
   But evolution remains the only hotly debated topic, said Glenn
Thomas, manager of the state Office of Curriculum Frameworks and
Textbook Development.
   ``It pulls together all that we have been trying to do into one
strong document. It clearly states why evolution is a necessary
organizing framework, an essential foundation, in teaching the
sciences,'' Thomas said.
   Earlier this decade, the state declared that evolution must be
taught. In 1985, educators adopted a new list of approved textbooks
and pressured publishers for more emphasis on evolution. Since most
publishers sell the same textbook to schools across the country,
the revisions California sought appear in books used in schools
nationwide, Thomas said.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Share Prices Tumble After Early Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen
Wednesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange erased
early gains and fell back.
   The dollar closed at 141.35 yen, down 1.45 yen from Tuesday's
close of 142.80 yen. It opened lower at 141.60 yen and moved beteen
140.95 yen and 141.62 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 74.25
points, or 0.21 percent, erasing morning gains to finish at
35,370.57.
   Currency dealers said central banks from Japan, the United
States and Canada stepped into the market in an apparent
coordinated action meant to stem the dollar's upward trend. The
amount of intervention by the three banks was not immediately known.
   It was the second such concerted action by the three central
banks this week in Tokyo. The first one was on Monday.
   The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, does not comment
on its monetary activities.
   ``The concerted intervention represented a firm commitment by
the monetary authorities to contain the dollar's upward move,''
following the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven nations, a
dealer at a major commercial bank said on condition of anonymity.
   Finance ministers and central bankers from the United States,
Japan, Canada, Britain, West Germany, France and Italy agreed at
the Washington meeting to closely cooperate in exchange markets to
check the dollar.
   Meanwhile, securities dealers said the market mood remained
positive after Tuesday's early advances. But the advances were
rolled back later in the day as investors sold for profit-taking.
   Institutional investors were still cautiously watching the
direction of foreign exchange rates, they said.

<TEXT>
   New Jersey's Republican gubernatorial candidate
wrote to the secretary of the Army in 1981 urging consideration of
the Wedtech Corp. for a contract, according to testimony in Rep.
Robert Garcia's extortion trial.
   In his letter to then-Army Secretary John O. Marsh, U.S. Rep.
James Courter called Wedtech a ``remarkable operation.''
   Wedtech, a Bronx defense contractor, collapsed in 1986 amid
allegations of corruption.
   Mario Moreno, former Wedtech vice chairman, testified Tuesday
that Garcia, D-N.Y., also showed other politicians Wedtech's
operations.
   Garcia's attorneys introduced the letter into evidence in the
U.S. District Court trial.
   Courter's campaign spokesman, Donald Sico, confirmed that Garcia
took the New Jersey congressman on a tour of Wedtech. The tour came
at a time when it was seeking a contract to build small engines for
the Army.
   ``Congressman Courter was impressed with the facility and sent a
letter expressing those sentiments to the secretary of the Army and
expressing his support for a procurement contract,'' Sico said.
``The letter was routine and innocuous and no further follow-up
efforts were made.''
   Garcia, a 56-year-old Bronx congressman, and his wife, Jane Lee
Garcia, 48, are charged with conspiring to trade favors to Wedtech
in return for a diamond and emerald necklace for Mrs. Garcia and
$185,000 in checks and interest-free loans.
   The Garcias pleaded innocent to charges of extortion,
conspiracy, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities. If convicted
of the most serious charge, extortion, they face up to 20 years in
prison.
   In his questioning of Moreno, Garcia's lawyer, Robert Morvillo,
argued that Garcia helped Wedtech because the military contractor
provided jobs to his poor, minority constituents.
   Moreno, the government's main witness, testified that Wedtech
approached Garcia for help in several areas.
   ``In all of these contacts was there anything you considered
improper done?'' Morvillo asked.
   ``I don't think so,'' Moreno said.
   Moreno testified that Wedtech also sought help from others,
including Rep. Mario Biaggi and E. Robert Wallach, a friend of
former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese. Biaggi and Wallach have
been convicted of racketeering charges stemming from the Wedtech
scandal.
   Moreno, who is serving an 18-month prison sentence, pleaded
guilty to bribe- and theft-related charges in 1987.

<TEXT>
   The European Community's leadership is
proposing $648 million in new aid for Poland and Hungary, money it
says is urgently needed so that economic instability does not
threaten the countries' reforms.
   Wrapping up a daylong meeting of 24 major non-communist donor
nations on ways to encourage democratic reform in Eastern Europe,
senior EEC officials also urged that Poland and Hungary work out
agreements with the International Monetary Fund to reschedule their
foreign debts.
   Hungary's debt is the highest per capita in the East bloc at $18
billion and Poland owes a debilitating $39 billion.
   Tuesday marked the second time the 24 nations have met to
discuss aid to Eastern Europe and they are scheduled to meet again
in November. The first meeting was held Aug. 1.
   A communique issued at the end of the meeting noted that
non-communist nations have already pledged $271 million in food aid
to Poland and Hungary.
   Of the $648 million in aid for next year, half would be financed
by the 12 European Community member nations and the remainder by
the 12 other donor nations. All donor nations and the European
Parliament must approve the proposals.
   The U.S. delegation did not pledge more aid than the $169
million already promised but indicated it could find additional
funds. It also said the $648 million should be seen as a minimum
amount, not a ceiling.
   Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Austria promised
development projects and credits totaling about $133 million.
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Community's executive
commission and Frans Andriessen, the Community's external relations
commissioner, said the economic and political reforms in Poland and
Hungary were ``still very fragile.''
   In a statement, they said Poles and Hungarians ``could well find
their new freedoms threatened by economic disorders.''
   ``It would be unthinkable to allow such disorders, which could
be alleviated through rapid action, to undermine the prospects for
change in Eastern Europe,'' they said.
   The program proposed by the commission included:
   _ Supplying pesticides, farm machinery and food to the Polish
government.
   _ Improving market access for Polish and Hungarian goods.
   _ Granting both countries new loans.
   _ Providing training to prepare both nations for market-oriented
economies.
   _ Aiding the clean up of industrialized areas and preservation
of historical and cultural sites.
   The non-EC donor nations are the six members of the European
Free Trade Association _ Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden
and Switzerland _ Japan, the United States, Canada, Australia, New
Zealand and Turkey.
   European Community foreign ministers may approve the plan as
early as next week at a regularly-scheduled EC meeting in
Luxembourg.

   An elderly PTL contributor called Jim
Bakker the most underpaid man in America, while a judge tiring of a
series of character witnesses asked defense attorneys to wrap up
their case.
   Marjorie Grey, who bought 32 of the $1,000 ``lifetime
partnerships'' at PTL, testified in Bakker's fraud trial that she
would gladly give money to the ministry again. However, her
testimony was later disallowed because she had attended earlier
sessions of the trial.
   ``I'd do it all over again,'' the 74-year-old Ms. Grey said.
``I'm interested in seeing that PTL is not taken away from us. Jim
Bakker is one of the best people I've ever known.''
   Ms. Grey was one of four satisfied PTL partners to testify
Tuesday. The PTL founder's attorneys have presented 34 witnesses _
most of them faithful contributors or former Bakker employees.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter called the number of character
witnesses ``ridiculous,'' and told defense attorney Harold Bender:
``We'll go on a little longer, but I'm getting tired of it. I think
the jury is, too, but it's up to you.''
   Bender said the defense could conclude its case Friday.
   Bakker is accused of defrauding followers by diverting more than
$3.7 million in PTL money to fund a lavish lifestyle. He could be
sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $5 million if
convicted on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
   In her testimony, Ms. Grey said she never had difficulty using
her partnerships, which gave her the right to annual stays at the
Heritage USA religious theme park.
   Prosecutors contend the partnerships that were sold greatly
outnumbered those available. Prosecution witnesses had testified
they had trouble getting reservations.
   Under cross-examination, Ms. Grey said she did not mind that
some of the partnership money would go for bonuses to Bakker.
   ``Oprah Winfrey gets $32 million for one TV show. He's the most
grossly underpaid man in America today,'' she said of Bakker.
   Also testifying Tuesday was Iva Mae Gravenar, who bought three
lifetime partnerships. She also said she never had a problem
getting a room at Heritage USA.
   ``Mr. Bakker didn't promise anything he didn't deliver,'' said
Ms. Gravenar, of Salisbury, Md. ``Everything he said he was going
to give us, he gave us.''
   Much of PTL's former theme park at Fort Mill, S.C., has been
closed permanently. Hurricane Hugo knocked out electricity and
phones at the Heritage USA park, hastening the closing, said M.C.
Benton, the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the property.
   In Orlando, Fla., Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye, said the hurricane
was an example of God's wrath.
   ``I said I believe the storm hitting Charlotte was a warning to
Charlotte,'' Mrs. Bakker said in a telephone interview. ``I said it
had nothing to do with Jim and Tammy Bakker, but it did have to do
with the way the people in Charlotte, North Carolina, have treated
God's people.''

<HEAD>Dollar Plunges Against Yen, Stocks Also Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued its plunge against the
Japanese yen today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell
after gaining for four consecutive trading days.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose in early
trading but ended up losing 74.25 points, or 0.21 percent, closing
at 35,370.57. On Tuesday, it had gained 484.11 points, the
second-largest one-day gain this year, reaching a high of 35,444.82.
   The index had gained 974.24 points over four trading days.
   The dollar closed at 141.35 yen, down 1.45 yen from Tuesday's
142.80-yen finish. It opened at 141.60 yen and moved between 140.95
yen and 141.62 yen.
   The dollar's close today was its lowest since 140.10 yen on Aug.
11.
   The U.S. currency now has fallen 3.65 yen in the three trading
days since seven major industrial nations agreed to cooperate in
checking the dollar's recent rise. The agreement was followed by
coordinated dollar selling by central banks, traders said.
   The Bank of Japan was selling dollars again today, but the
amount was unknown, said Masafumi Koyama, a Bank of Tokyo trader.
   The central bank does not comment on its exchange market
activities.
   Koyama said the dollar was unlikely to fall much below 140 yen,
since an excessive fall over a short period would be unfavorable
for the international economy.
   ``In addition, considering that the dollar's recent fall has
been mainly prompted by the central banks' coordinated
intervention, it will not last long because it's impossible for the
banks to keep selling the dollar every day forever,'' Koyama said.
   ``As soon as they stop the dollar-selling operation, the
currency will start rising back,'' he said.
   On the stock exchange, ``the major reason for the index's fall
today was too much gain yesterday,'' said Tomoyuki Morimoto, a
dealer with New Japan Securities Co. Ltd. He said investors sold to
take profits after Tuesday's substantial gains.
   ``The rumor that West Germany might raise its interest rate also
discouraged investors,'' he said.
   Construction, electrical and housing issues all declined today.
   Trading was active, with first section volume estimated at 1
billion shares, up from Tuesday's 900 million.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Johannesburg formally opened
all public facilities to blacks today after the city council voted
to desegregate buses, swimming pools and recreation centers.
   The move was approved at a city council meeting Tuesday night
despite strong opposition from members of the far-right
Conservative Party who favor strict segregation.
   ``We are taking a large step in South African terms,'' said
council member Harold Rudolph, who voted in favor of integration.
``I am so glad we are putting right that which was wrong.''
   Most public facilities in major cities have been desegregated in
recent years, either informally or by the repeal of apartheid
legislation.
   However, the council's decision marked the first formal
declaration to integrate all public facilities controlled by the
city. Cape Town already has taken similiar steps.
   The council's decision does not affect schools, neighborhoods or
hospitals, which are segregated by national and provincial laws.
Also, private facilities may be segregated under the Separate
Amenities Act.
   Earlier this year, the Johannesburg city council polled white
voters on the question of integration. Most said they approved of
desegregated buses and recreation centers, but almost 60 percent
were opposed to opening swimming pools to blacks.
   ``We know (integration) is going create problems but these are
manageable problems and we will rise to the challenge,'' said
council member Ian Davidson.
   The Five Freedoms Forum, an anti-apartheid group, said it
welcomed the council's decision.
   ``If facilities controlled by the council can be opened, so then
can the facilities such as hospitals and schools that are
controlled by the central and provincial governments,'' the group
said.
   Anti-apartheid groups launched a nationwide defiance campaign on
Aug. 2 that has targeted segregated schools, neighborhoods,
beaches, buses and other facilities.
   A major demonstration is planned Saturday at beaches near Cape
Town, where last month police used batons, whips and tear gas to
disperse blacks who attempted to march on ``whites-only'' beaches.
The beaches fall under the jurisdiction of provincial authorities,
not the city council.
   Johannesburg, along with Durban and Cape Town, are considered
the most liberal cities in the country. Towns just outside
Johannesburg, such as Boksburg, have been re-imposing rigid
apartheid since the Conservative Party won control of some local
councils in municipal elections a year ago.
   In Boksburg and elsewhere, blacks have been barred from public
parks and other facilities that had been integrated for several
years.
   The Johannesburg city council is controlled by the National
Party, which has governed South Africa for 41 years and codified
apartheid laws in the early 1950s.
   President F.W. de Klerk, who was sworn into office last week,
said his government seeks to end discrimination but he has not
specified any apartheid laws that he will repeal.
   He also has said he favors segregated schools and neighborhoods
for whites who want them.
   Tens of thousands of blacks have moved illegally into
whites-only neighborhoods in inner cities. The government has
virtually stopped prosecutions under the law that segregates
residential areas and says it is considering opening some
neighborhoods to all races.

   Here is a state-by-state look at the damage and deaths caused by
Hurricane Hugo and its remnants:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOUTH CAROLINA:
   Charleston _ At least 17 deaths reported, with damage estimated
at $1 billion or more. About 50,000 people in the area were still
out of their homes today. A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in effect.
Charleston Harbor reopened to limited ship traffic Tuesday. Power
was restored to about 20 percent of customers.
   Columbia _ Trees and power lines down. 25,000 people remained
without electricity Tuesday.
   Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island _ Residents continued to
return home Tuesday by boat, but under police escort and only to
look at their homes and collect a few belongings before returning
to mainland. Downed power lines and trees and leaking propane gas
create a dangerous situation. The only bridge to the mainland was
washed out.
   Garden City _ Among the hardest hit areas. Water surged as much
as three blocks inland. Electricity was restored to most of the
city by Tuesday.
   Hilton Head _ Less damage than expected, mostly roof and water
damage. Some broken windows, downed trees and power lines.
   Murrells Inlet _ A marina and dock destroyed, as well as several
homes. Most of the town had electricity restored Tuesday.
   Myrtle Beach _ Damage estimated at more than $600 million in
Horry County. High-rise motels remain standing, but swimming pools,
first-floor lobbies, restaurants and parking lots are damaged. Some
hotels and motels reopened Monday, but a curfew remained in effect.
   Pawleys Island _ Entire island without electricity, but most of
mainland had power restored Tuesday. At least 14 homes destroyed.
   Rock Hill _ Damage estimated at $11 million in York County.
Electricity still out in several areas.
   Sumter _ Damage estimated at more than $100 million in Sumter
County. Sixteen houses and 160 trailers destroyed, about 900 suffer
major damage. Seventy-five percent of the people still without
power or water.

   NORTH CAROLINA:
   At least four deaths reported, with damage statewide estimated
at more than $500 million. Nearly 300,000 electric customers still
without power.
   Charlotte: Damage estimated at $336 million and $75 million in
Brunswick County, the state's only coastal area affected by Hugo.
Over the weekend, 33 people arrested for looting in Charlotte,
where 200 National Guard troops have been sent to help police.

   Shrimpers whose families have made a
living off the sea for generations are vowing to return, even
though Hurricane Hugo wiped out shrimp beds and tossed around their
trawlers like toys.
   ``I'm going to have to get my house straight and my boat
straight, and I reckon I'll have to go south for shrimping,'' said
Charles Sellers, 37, a shrimper for 14 years.
   But, he added, ``I'll be back.''
   Generations of families have made their livelihoods shrimping
the marshes and creeks of the Intracoastal Waterway. Hugo, with its
135 mph winds and 17-foot tidal surge, destroyed the shrimp beds in
this fishing village of 500 at the height of the season.
   Shrimpers said the harvest this year had been one of the best
before Hugo struck, with daily catches running at 300 pounds to 500
pounds, which is double last year's. The shrimping season runs from
May to November.
   Shrimping is a $30 million a year industry along the coast, and
the fishermen aren't the only ones to suffer.
   ``The biggest thing is people who buy the shrimp _ the packing
houses _ they're all wiped out. They're destroyed,'' said Jimmy
Scott, 45, a shrimper for the past 21 years. ``By the time they get
it built back, the season is over.''
   His 68-foot boat, the Mary Margaret, lay stranded on the main
approach to the dock. Its riggings were tangled with a battered oak
tree.
   Scott said he'll still live in McClellanville, but will have to
find another place to shrimp.
   ``I'm born and raised here. I've got to stay here,'' he said.
   The town, three miles from the ocean, was founded in the early
1800s by planters who wanted to escape the intense summertime heat.
It evolved into a quaint village of moss-draped oak trees and
narrow streets, with many of its residents making their living
catching shrimp, oysters and fish.
   Thomas Colleton and his family of nine weathered the storm in
their home two miles from the water. Colleton, 57, who works for
other shrimpers, said he was unsure when he would work again.
   Wayne Potter's 60-foot trawler was destroyed and he lost his
house in the storm. But Potter, who has been a shimper for 35 years
like his father and grandfather before him, cannot imagine a life
away from the sea.
   Nor can other shrimpers, he said.
   ``They're going to stick with it. As soon as they get their
boats back in shape, they're going to get right back into
business,'' Potter said.

<HEAD>Sister's Death Brings Two Brothers Out of an Urban Cave</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Ring and his sister, Marie, were mostly
homebodies but they kept up appearances by dressing well, going to
church every Sunday and sending bouquets of flowers to neighbors
every Christmas and Easter.
   Only when Marie Ring died Friday of hardening of the arteries at
age 58 did their hermit-like existence become known.
   Inside their three-story row house, the reclusive siblings lived
in what had become a kind of urban cave, with two dozen cats. They
had no running water, electricity or heat.
   They also had a third sibling, 62-year-old Vincent, who
apparently never went outside.
   Police said they found Marie dead, and 59-year-old John and
Vincent in poor mental condition. The brothers refused to leave the
house, but were sent to Boston City Hospital for evaluation. A
hospital spokeswoman would say only that they were in stable
condition and that doctors had forbidden interviews.
   But in an interview with The Boston Globe in Tuesday's editions,
John Ring said, ``The cats took all our money. ... Cost us $60 a
week worth of cat food. That's why we couldn't fix the place up.
But we're gonna now.''
   The city, though, has boarded up and condemned the house.
   And the Animal Rescue League has taken the cats.
   Gerri Abban, the cashier at Bell's Market near the house, said
the Rings would not let anyone into their home. She asked city
counselors and priests to help them, but they told her the family
had a right to privacy.
   Ms. Abban said she and her bosses, Matthew Cohen and his son,
Alan, were able to provide some assistance.
   ``I sold them charcoal in the winter so they could heat the
house,'' Ms. Abban said. ``I sold them rubbing alcohol, five
bottles at a time, so they could cook. I sold them bottle after
bottle of Anacin because they'd get wicked headaches from the smell
in the house. Paper plates, paper cups, bottled water. It was
unbelievable.''
   Their toilets didn't flush. They used candles and flashlights.
And they cooked meals in a pan on an alcohol burner.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said Matthew Ryan, a 72-year-old
retired union leader who has lived next door to the Rings for about
30 years. ``Who could get by today without electricity and gas and
water? ... I would have helped them, but they weren't people who
wanted you to get involved.''
   John Ring told the Globe that Vincent was wounded in World War
II and hadn't worked since 1953; Marie quit working in 1957 and
John hasn't had a job since 1961. They had lived in the house with
their parents, who died more than 10 years ago.
   Ryan said he thought Vincent had died until a fire broke out in
two nearby houses 15 years ago.
   He saw a man with a beard down to his belt and a blanket over
his head. ``I said, `Who is that?' And someone said, `That's
Vincent.' I never believed there was (a third person) in there.''
   Matthew Cohen, proprietor of Bell's since 1956, said the Rings
paid with personal checks that occasionally bounced. Cohen, who
gave them discounts, said the brothers received ``disability checks
or veterans checks or something.''
   He tried to send an electrician and a plumber to their house,
but the Rings wouldn't let them in. He knew John Ring was on
medication, and when he was off it.
   ``If John didn't take his medication, he went wild _ when he'd
come down to the store to buy, he'd stuff his pockets, he'd throw
things around and yell at people. We understood him. We did the
best we could. We got him home.''
   Cohen said Marie Ring, once an accountant, was ``a very fine
lady, always well-spoken. She seemed to be well-read and her whole
life was taking care of her two brothers. It's a mystery to me why,
but she did it.''

<TEXT>
   The Chicago Cubs became this year's first
baseball team to win a division title, beating Montreal, 3-2, to
clinch the National League East crown.
   Chicago will open the playoffs Wednesday night at Wrigley Field,
all but certainly against San Francisco. Despite losing Tuesday,
the Giants clinched a tie for the National League West title as
Cincinnati beat second-place San Diego, 5-3.
   In Montreal, a crowd of 11,615, bolstered by three tour groups
from Chicago, sat quiet for most of the night at Olympic Stadium.
   In the eighth inning, Cubs fans roared when Ryne Sandberg dashed
home with the winning run as right fielder Hubie Brooks bobbled a
single.
   The victory made Don Zimmer a champion for the first time in 11
years of managing. After the final out, the Cubs darted out of the
dugout and celebrated at the pitching mound.
   The Cubs have not been in the World Series since 1945 and have
not won it since 1908, but back in Chicago, fans were dreaming of a
world championship.
   ``This is a major, major thing,'' said 23-year-old Franci Nenko,
after watching the game on television with about 300 fans at the
Cubby Bear, across the street from Wrigley Field. ``We're going all
the way now!''

<HEAD>Tentative Treaty Rights Settlement Reached</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT IMRIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RHINELANDER, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A band of Chippewa Indians has agreed
to curtail its spearfishing and other treaty rights in exchange for
an expected multimillion-dollar aid package.
   The tentative accord Tuesday came after months of negotiations
by the state with leaders of the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa band,
whose spring spearfishing has sparked widespread and sometimes
violent protests by treaty rights opponents.
   If approved by tribal members and the Legislature, the agreement
would be the first reached between the state and its six Chippewa
bands. The Mole Lake band reached a tentative agreement with the
state, but that $10 million, 10-year deal was voted down by tribal
members in January.
   Treaty rights of the Chippewa to hunt and fish on
non-reservation lands across much of northern Wisconsin have been
upheld in a series of federal court rulings since 1983.
   State Attorney General Donald Hanaway said the tentative
agreement with the Lac du Flambeau would span 10 years and include
a trust fund for the band.
   The Lac du Flambeau, the most active Chippewa band in
spearfishing, would continue ceremonial spearfishing but ``agreed
to forebear and forego the exercise of their treaty rights,''
Hanaway said.
   Both sides declined to disclose details.
   Lac du Flambeau leaders had been seeking a 10-year deal worth
$42 million, including payments of about $1,400 per individual
member. The state recently added other provisions, reportedly worth
up to $10 million.
   Hanaway said he hoped to have the tentative agreement in writing
within a week, and have a final document ready for the Legislature
by mid-October.
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said he supported the tentative accord,
but some legislators expressed caution.
   Assembly Minority Leader David Prosser called the agreement ``an
encouraging sign,'' but Sen. Joseph Leean said it probably would
take ``one heck of a sell job'' for him to support it.
   He said voters did not believe ``we ought to have to ante up
millions of dollars when the problem was created by federal
treaties.''
   Michael Allen, tribal chairman, said the tribal council approved
of the package, and he planned to take it to members for a vote.
   James Klauser, state administration secretary and Thompson's
chief adviser, said the fund would be administered by trustees, and
the money would be used for education, law enforcement, health and
economic development programs.
   The accord could serve as a model for the state's other five
Chippewa bands, said James Jannetta, Lac du Flambeau tribal
attorney.
   ``Hopefully, other bands will look at this as a historic step,''
he said.
   Spearfishing by the Chippewas prompted demonstrations at some
northern boat landings by hundreds of people in recent years.
   Opposition to spearfishing grew even more heated this year after
the state announced it would reduce walleye pike catch limits for
sport anglers. The announcement followed a federal court ruling
that allowed the Chippewa to spear as many of the fish that
biologists determined could be taken from the lakes without hurting
the fish population.
   Last spring's spearfishing season was marked by incidents of
name-calling and rock-throwing at some lakes and resulted in about
200 arrests.
   Federal court rulings since 1983 upheld provisions of 19th
century treaties that allow the Chippewa to fish, hunt, trap and
harvest wild grain on non-reservation lands across most of northern
Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   A man under investigation in the Green
River serial slayings of up to 48 young women pleaded innocent to
possession of a firearm while a fugitive.
   William Jay Stevens II finished a sentence for burglary and
escape in Seattle on Monday and was brought here Tuesday by federal
marshals, said Deputy U.S. Marshal Marvin Lutes.
   Magistrate James Hovis entered a plea of innocent on behalf of
Stevens to the charge of being a felon and fugitive in possession
of a firearm.
   Roger Peven, a court-appointed defense attorney, said he would
move today for a bail hearing to win Stevens' release.
   The Green River Task Force has characterized Stevens as a
``viable suspect'' in its investigation into the deaths of 40 women
and the disappearances of eight others in the Northwest from
1982-84.
   Stevens has not been charged in any of the killings and has
denied he is the killer.
   A .45-caliber Colt handgun found in a house where Stevens was
arrested in January is the basis for the federal charge. He was
arrested for a 1981 escape from a work release center where he was
serving a burglary sentence.
   If convicted on the weapon possession charge, Stevens faces a
maximum 10 year prison term and $250,000 fine.

<TEXT>
   This island town's one-room, one-pupil
school has hired its one teacher _ a former professor with a
doctorate in education.
   Eloise Seifert of Centerville, the former education coordinator
of schools in coastal Scituate, beat out a field of applicants from
around the country for the $24,000 job on the island, which has a
year-round population of 50 people.
   ``We got applications from people who didn't have any
credentials but figured we might get stuck, and people who just
decided it looked like a pleasant place to be for a year,'' said
Russell Latham, superintendent of the Berkley-Gosnold schools.
   Seifert, an owner of a Barnstable cleaning business who received
her doctorate from Boston University, also has been a university
professor in New York and a reading specialist in the Needham
public schools.
   ``It's assumed by some that it's a snap,'' Latham said. ``But
it's quite a job to offer a young man a chance to do some
independent work when there are only two of you in the room and to
plan interesting things all the time.''
   Island life also may be an adjustment. The only telephone is a
pay phone at the general store. And a ferry to the mainland runs
only on Tuesdays and Fridays in the winter.
   Gosnold is the only town on Cuttyhunk island, a popular summer
tourist spot about 15 miles southwest of Woods Hole. The town has
an inn-restaurant, a bakery and deli-style sandwich shop, the
general store, municipal offices and a library.
   In the 1930s, as many as 17 students were enrolled in Gosnold's
century-old school house. But this year, like last, only one
youngster is in school, and it may close in 1991 when the
13-year-old seventh grader attends high school on the mainland.
   ``The school probably will close unless some family presents a
child,'' Latham said.

<HEAD>Government Begins Cease-Fire, But Sinhalese Extremists Ignore It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops waging a campaign
against Sinhalese militants today began observing a three-day
cease-fire but extremists ignored the truce, killing at least two
people.
   The government had hoped the cease-fire would encourage members
of the militant People's Liberation Front to open peace talks with
the Sinhalese-dominated government.
   But less than four hours after the cease-fire began at 6 a.m.,
Sinhalese extremists shot and killed two bodyguards of Jayasinghe
Bandara, a member of the government's Provincial Council, military
officials said.
   The gunmen ambushed Bandara's car about 80 miles east of Colombo
but he escaped unharmed, said the officials, who cannot be
identified under briefing rules.
   Sinhalese radicals also set fire to three government-owned buses
in central Sri Lanka, but there were no casualties, they said
   The cease-fire was ordered one week after Indian peacekeeping
soldiers suspended military operations against minority Tamil
rebels demanding a separate homeland in the northeast.
   Tamil separatists have so far honored a truce called for in the
agreement, under which the 42,000 remainingIndian troops are to be
out of the country by year's end.
   The decision to call the three-day cease-fire was made during a
meeting last week between President Ranasinghe Premadasa and the
five major opposition party leaders.
   ``It was agreed as an immediate step to call upon all armed
militant groups to desist from acts of violence and sabotage,''
officials said in a statement. ``If the armed militant groups
respond favorably to this call, ... This period of three days would
be extended.''
   The cease-fire was one of 10 proposals in an opposition-proposed
plan aimed at ending the campaign of strikes, assassinations and
terror inspired by the Sinhalese militants.
   The People's Liberation Front began its anti-government campaign
after Sri Lanka signed a peace accord in July 1987 aimed at ending
the Tamil insurgency. by offering the Tamils limited autonomy if
they would give up their weapons.
   Troops from neighboring India were invited in to supervise the
surrender.
   But the Sinhalese militants said the accord offered too many
concessions to the mainly Hindu Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of
Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   Tamils claim they are denied jobs and education by the
mostly-Buddhist Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population
and dominate the government and military.
   Sinhalese militants also objected to the presence of Indian
peacekeeping troops, saying it threatened the country's sovereignty.
   More than 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian peacekeeping
troops, have been killed in the Tamil insurgency since it started
in 1983. More than 5,000 others have died in the Sinhalese backlash.
   More than 200,000 leaflets in the Sinhalese language were
dropped from airplanes by government troops Tuesday over remote
villages. The leaflets offered up to 20,000 rupees ($510) to
extremists who surrender.
   ``It is foolish to destroy young lives in this way. You are
destroying the future of the country's youth. Take advantage of
this opportunity and give yourselves up, you will be warmly
received and fully protected,'' the leaflets said.
   There were no reports of any surrender, but officials said it
was too early for reports to come in.

   The dollar weakened in early European trading
today, pounded by central bank intervention in earlier Asian
trading, currency dealers said.
   Gold prices rose.
   Foreign currency dealers said confirmed dollar sales by the Bank
of Japan and West German Bundesbank and reported sales by the U.S.
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada in the Asian session added
to the market's nervousness after two days of staggered open-market
central bank interventions.
   Traders reported the Bank of England and central banks of Italy,
Belgium and Spain were selling dollars in early European trading.
   The size of central bank intervention since last weekend's
meeting of finance chiefs from the Group of Seven industrialized
nations remains unknown. But traders said it was the frequency of
sales rather than the size that was pushing down the dollar.
   ``The central banks are trying to show the market they're
insistent about a lower dollar,'' said one trader in Milan, Italy.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 1.45 yen to a closing 141.35 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 141.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   --1.8735 West German marks, down from 1.8885
   --1.6255 Swiss francs, down from 1.6390
   --6.3450 French francs, down from 6.3990
   --2.1268 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1480
   --1,355.00 Italian lire, down from 1,377.00
   --1.1753 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1750
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6225 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6215 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at $368 a troy ounce, compared with late
Tuesday's $367.75. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $369.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $369, up from $367.75 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.09 to close at $369.92.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.30 a troy ounce, down from
Tuesday's $5.31.

   Gay rights and AIDS activists blocked the entrance
to the Dallas County Health Department with 90 dummies to protest
the start of a federal door-to-door AIDS survey.
   ``The time for studies is passed. The time for action is now,''
activists chanted Tuesday as they blocked the health department
door with shirts and pants that were sewn up and stuffed to
resemble bodies.
   The number of dummies represented the number of people who will
die of AIDS in Dallas County during the survey period, said William
Waybourn, president of the Dallas Gay Alliance.
   ``There is an AIDS death in Dallas County every day,'' Waybourn
said.
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services approved last
month a survey of Dallas County residents over a three- to
four-month period in an attempt to determine the county's rate of
AIDS infection.
   The survey of 3,400 households also is intended to determine the
feasibility of a national AIDS survey next year.
   The survey asks one adult in each of the households to take a
blood test for the AIDS virus and answer questions about sexual
habits and drug use. A pilot study was conducted in Pennsylvania's
Allegheny County early this year and 85 percent of the 308 eligible
residents approached participated.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by the HIV, or
human immunodeficiency virus. The virus damages the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and
cancer.
   Proponents say the survey will shape government spending on AIDS
prevention and treatment.
   ``At this point the only solid numbers that we have deal with
AIDS patients, not with HIV-infected persons,'' said Dr. Gordon
Green, director of the Dallas County Health Department.

<HEAD>Peace Protester Abie Nathan Pleads Guilty To Meeting With PLO</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Peace activist Abie Nathan pleaded guilty
today to breaking an Israeli law that bans contacts with the PL0,
but said he would keep defying such laws in his quest for peace
with the Arabs.
   Nathan, 63, who operates the pirate radio station ``Voice of
Peace,'' was indicted last year for meeting PLO Chief Yasser Arafat
and several of his aides in Tunisia and France in September 1988.
   ``I knew about the law and I know that it entailed punishment,
but I acted in order to save the lives of people and I am prepared
to break the law to acheive this,'' Nathan said in an emotional
plea to the court.
   ``I think I convinced our main enemy to grasp the olive
branch,'' Nathan said. ``I don't think I did any harm to Israel's
security.''
   The law forbids unauthorized contacts with ``terrorist groups''
and provides for a maximum three year jail sentence. The PLO is not
named in the law, but Israel considers the group a terrorist
organization.
   On Wednesday, the Jerusalem Post reported that two Palestinians
from the occupied West Bank met with Arafat abroad recently with
the knowledge of Israel's Defense Ministry.
   It quoted an Israeli source as saying the government does not
encourage such meetings but does not punish Palestinians for taking
part.
   Nathan's sentencing was scheduled for Tuesday.
   Prosecuting attorney Raanan Ben Yosef asked for a stiff
sentence, saying Nathan's meetings abroad harmed Israel's security
by ``legitimatizing terrorist organizations and serving to
de-demonize Arafat.''
   Nathan's radio station broacasts from a ship in the
Mediterranean. He is known for making a private peace mission to
Egypt when the country was at war with Israel in the 1960s and
staging a 45-day hunger strike in 1978 to protest the building of
Jewish settlements in the occupied lands.

   A police officer who looked after
impounded drugs was charged today with stealing $16 million worth
of heroin, marijuana and cocaine from a narcotics storage facility.
   Michael Wallace allegedly siphoned off seized drugs and then
resold them, police told Sydney's Central Local Court.
   Wallace, 36, who worked at the Federal Drug Registry, was
arrested during early morning searches of his home and those of his
parents and brother.
   Police said they recovered 35 pounds of heroin, about 4.5 pounds
of cocaine, 22 pounds of hashish and a small quantity of marijuana
as well as $190,000 in cash.
   Wallace entered no plea to charges of possession of illegal
drugs and obtaining money illegally. He was ordered held in custody
until his next court appearance on Oct. 4.
   John Johnson, Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal
Police, said today that more police officers may be involved.
   ``In the ideal world, we would hope this would never occur,''
Johnson said. ``For it to take place in an organization like ours
is highly embarrassing and, of course, gives us no credit at all.''
   He said it was not the first time an officer had been charged
with stealing drugs from the registry, but the alleged amounts were
the largest.

<TEXT>
   A state law that allows men to go
bare-chested in public but forbids women from doing the same is
unconstitutional, contends a group of women fighting for ``topfree
equality.''
   Ten women arrested June 24 for doffing their tops at a beach on
Lake Ontario argued Tuesday in court that a statute prohibiting
them from baring their breats is discriminatory.
   City Court Judge John Manning Regan will resume hearing
testimony in the case today.
   The statute denies the women their constitutionally guaranteed
right to equal protection under the law, said attorney Sharon Kelly
Sayers, who represents eight of the women.
   ``This statute is a tool for police officers to harass and
intimidate women,'' she said. ``It's a discriminatory law.''
   Assistant District Attorney Ann Chase said she does not plan to
address the constitutional issue.
   The women were charged under New York's exposure of person
statute for refusing to put shirts on when Monroe County sheriff's
deputies asked them to.
   ``They are here only because they are women, doing simple
everyday things that men are allowed to do everyday,'' said Jeffrey
Wicks, attorney for defendant Nina Leibowitz.
   Topfree Equality picnics have been held since 1986, when several
of the same women were arrested for going topless. Those charges
were dismissed when a judge ruled that the topless picnic had been
an expression of free speech.
   Women are allowed to expose their breasts while entertaining or
breast-feeding, said group organizer Mary Lou Schloss, who
represented herself at the trial.
   Those exemptions ``result in a patriarchal situation where a
woman is `allowed' to expose her breasts to feed a baby or to dance
provocatively to sexually arouse men, but may not for her own
comfort swim or sun topfree,'' she said.
   State law barred men from baring their chests until 1942,
Schloss said, when their protests provoked a change in the statute.
   ``Women must be allowed the same right that men have had for 50
years in New York state, the right to enjoy the sun, air and water
topless,'' she said.

   A gang-related melee with racial overtones
erupted among more than 300 prisoners at an overcrowded,
maximum-security prison, officials said. Guards apparently shot to
death one inmate and wounded four.
   Guards fired as many as 50 shots Tuesday in an effort to quell
the disturbance, which involved up to 325 of the 700 inmates who
were out of their cells at the Menard Correctional Center, said
Corrections Director Michael Lane.
   Slain was James Bailey, 34, who was serving time for attempted
murder. In all, 21 people were injured, including two guards, said
prison spokesman Nic Howell.
   ``The disturbance certainly was gang-related, and considering
the nature of the gangs here, it had definite racial overtones,''
Lane said.
   He said fighting appeared to have started _ possibly
simultaneously _ in the West Cellhouse and the dining room.
   Lane said most of the shots were warning shots in the air.
   Asked if the gunshots came from the guards, Howell said, ``We
don't know that for a fact. We would presume.'' He said prison
officials had not recovered any guns ``that were not to be there.''
   One guard had a possible broken jaw and one received minor
buckshot injuries, he said.
   Nine inmates were taken to Chester Memorial hospital, four with
gunshot wounds, four with stab wounds and one with contusions to
the eye and back, a hospital spokesman said.
   Howell said the inmate population at Menard, the state's
second-oldest prison, was 2,539 at the end of last week.
   ``That's 74 percent more than the prison was designed to hold,''
he said.
   Lane said about 30 percent of the Menard inmates are white, 64
percent are black and 6 percent are Hispanic.

   President Bush says Hollywood is owed thanks
for recent movies that have portrayed the ravages of drug addiction.
   ``I want to thank the film industry for helping stop this
terrible threat to our kids,'' the president told a star-studded
gala tribute to the American Film Institute Tuesday night. ``I
welcome your leadership.''
   Bush named ``Lean on Me,'' ``Clean and Sober'' and ``Dancing as
Fast as I Can,'' as motion pictures that have shown the
consequences of drug abuse.
   The president also had a ringside seat for an unusual
performance by comic Steve Martin, who performed as ``The Great
Flydini,'' a magician with an uncanny knack for pulling things out
of the open fly of his pants.
   Out came eggs, a telephone, a cocktail glass _ filled no less _
scarves, smoke from a cigarette and a hand puppet that gyrated and
sang Pagliacci. For an encore, Martin blew bubbles from the same
opening in his tuxedo.
   ``Imagine meeting Steve Martin, something I've always wanted to
do,'' Bush said with a straight face. ``Now I want to find the name
of his tailor.''
   Television host Phil Donahue offered a more barbed critique of
Martin's performance.
   ``Boy, it's been a while since I've seen the president of the
United States entertained by a guy with bubbles coming out of his
crotch,'' said Donahue.
   The dinner at the National Building Museum marked the 24th
anniversary of the Rose Garden ceremony at which President Lyndon
B. Johnson signed the legislation creating the National Endowment
for the Arts and its sister endowment for the humanities.
   Two years later, the NEA spawned the American Film Institute, a
private non-profit entity that works to preserve film and
television and to train young directors.
   The black-tie crowd included actors Charlton Heston, Douglas
Fairbanks Jr., John Travolta and Christopher Reeve and actresses
Marlo Thomas and Brooke Shields.

   Two state agriculture workers sprayed a
woman in the face with a toxic pesticide in a traffic dispute,
police said.
   The unidentified 41-year-old woman was making a turn Tuesday
when she got into an argument with the men, who then pulled
alongside her car and sprayed her with a chemical used against
Oriental fruit flies, said Sgt. Donald A. Goldberg.
   As the truck drove off, the woman heard laughter and saw the
driver make an obscene gesture, police said.
   The woman ``experienced a burning sensation to her eyes and
face, her vision became blurred, and she had a numbing sensation to
her mouth,'' Goldberg said. The woman was treated at a hospital and
released, police said.
   Police stopped the truck and arrested Walter K. Rowland, 30, of
Van Nuys and Mario E. Jarquin, 18, of North Hollywood, for
investigation of assault with a caustic chemical.
   Police said the two were part-time workers who were in the area
to spray for fruit flies. The woman was believed to have been
sprayed with a chemical that can be fatal if absorbed through the
skin, police said.

<TEXT>
   Track star Zola Budd sent a
wreath but did not attend today's funeral for her father, who was
found shot to death in his farmhouse last week.
   South African news media reported that Frank Budd, 59, had said
in his will that his three daughters were not welcome at his
funeral.
   Two of the daughters, and Budd's only son, Quintus, did attend.
But Ms. Budd and her husband, liquor store owner Mike Pieterse,
were not there.
   Ms. Budd has been estranged from her father for several years.
He did not attend her April 15 wedding, saying he was not invited.
   Ms. Budd's mother, Tossie, also was not at the funeral. She was
divorced from Budd shortly after the athlete competed in the Los
Angeles Olympics in 1984 on a British passport.
   Zola Budd told South African newspapers after her father's death
that she believed his homosexuality was the cause of her parents'
divorce. But police have said they are not investigating any
connection between Budd's homosexuality and his death.
   Chris Botha Barnard, whose age has been given as 24 or 26, was
arrested Friday, hours after Budd's body was found in the bedroom
of a house he had built on a friend's farm.
   Police said Barnard had worked for Budd for a few days, doing
construction. Police said they found Budd's shotgun, which they
said was used to kill him, his pickup truck, and other belongings
after they arrested Barnard.
   Because of her father's British heritage, Zola Budd was able to
obtain a British passport quickly to compete in the 1984 Summer
Olympics. South Africans are barred from the Olympics and most
international track competitions because of the government's
apartheid policies of racial segregation.
   In the 3,000-meter run in Los Angeles, the barefoot Ms. Budd
collided with U.S. star Mary Decker, and the American was unable to
continue. Budd finished seventh amid a chorus of boos.
   She later set several world distance running records while
living and training in Britain. But she was constantly dogged by
anti-apartheid activists who said she should not be allowed to
compete because of her South African connections.
   Ms. Budd, 23, returned to South Africa in May 1988, and has
announced plans to forego international competition.

   A man released from a mental hospital Aug.
28 cut off his left hand for the second time in seven months with a
circular saw, police said.
   The hand had been reattached the first time but could not be
saved again, doctors said.
   ``He said the hand was useless and he didn't want it anymore,''
said Waterford Township police Officer John McLain. ``He said he
wanted to kill himself, but was feeling OK now and didn't want to
anymore.''
   State mental health officials want to know why the unidentified
27-year-old Pontiac man was released from the state-run Clinton
Valley Center. He had been living in a group home with five other
mental patients since his release.
   ``There was every indication he was doing well'' before his
release, hospital Director Anthony Drabik said. ``It's tragic. We
feel very badly about this.''
   The man cut the hand off in February in an apparent suicide
attempt, police said. He apparently bought a circular saw, checked
into a motel Monday and severed his hand again, McLain said.
   The man's hand could not be reattached because it was a jagged
cut, said Dr. Robert Aranosian, chief of emergency medicine at
Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital.
   Thomas Watkins Jr., director of the state Department of Mental
Health, said a review of the placement agency, the hospital and the
home will be conducted to see if the incident could have been
prevented.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of shells pelted a Khmer Rouge
refugee camp near the Cambodian border today, forcing thousands of
refugees to flee or take cover, a relief official said.
   The official, who asked not to be named, said more than 1,000
refugees fled the Site 8 refugee camp into the mountains deeper
inside Thai territory as the barrage was fired from inside Cambodia.
   The shells were believed fired by Cambodian government troops
reacting to Khmer Rouge operations in the area.
   ``The bunkers are full, the culverts are full. Nobody is out on
the road,'' the official said of the camp, which houses 41,000
refugees. For safety reasons, the U.N. Border Relief Organization
placed the camp off-limits to aid workers.
   Fighting along the Thai-Cambodian border has intensified in
recent weeks as Vietnam announced a total pullout of its forces
that were backing the Vietnam-installed government. Vietnam says
the pullout was completed on Tuesday.
   The Khmer Rouge are loosely allied to two non-communist
guerrilla groups that have been fighting the Phnom Penh government
and the Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and toppled a
Khmer Rouge government.
   The Khmer Rouge were in power in Cambodia in 1975-1978. During
that time, hundreds of thousands of Cambodia's 8 million people
died from Khmer Rouge executions, famine and civil unrest.
   The Khmer Rouge radio said its guerrillas have begun a new
offensive on the gem-trading center of Pailin in western Cambodia
and were shelling the town from all sides.
   The guerrilla radio, the Voice of the National Army of
Democratic Kampuchea, has recently claimed a series of battle
successes in the region around Pailin. The town is northwest of
Phnom Penh close to the Thai frontier.
   The latest claim came late Tuesday, as Vietnamese troops were
completing what they said was their final withdrawal.
   A text of the broadcast was received today in Bangkok.
   It said the guerrillas had reorganized into three attack forces
after ``smashing the small, medium and large positions of the
Vietnamese enemies and their puppets ... protecting Pailin from the
north and west.''
   The radio charged that despite Vietnam's assurances that all its
troops have left Cambodia, Hanoi had sent 3,000 troops to help
defend Pailin.
   It was not possible to verify this claim. However, many Western
analysts doubt that the Vietnamese would have left behind such a
large force.
   Gen. Pat Akkanibut of Thailand's Supreme Military Command told
The Associated Press that there were suspicions about a residual
Vietnamese military presence in Cambodia but that it was too early
to make an assessment.
   ``Let this game (withdrawal) finish and then we will watch,'' he
said, adding that it was vital for all parties that an
international monitoring mechanism be set up to determine whether
Vietnam had kept its pledge.
   Thailand supports the guerrillas and allows weapons from China
to pass through its territory to their border bases.
   In Trang Lon Tay, Vietnam, officers from a withdrawing
Vietnamese army division said today that they believe the Cambodian
government forces could quickly defeat the Khmer Rouge if Thailand
stops giving them shelter.
   ``If the Thai government stops its support of the guerrillas,
the Cambodian government will have no problem ending the
insurgency,'' said Bui Buc Tran, deputy commander of the 5th
Division. ``We are completely satisfied that the Cambodian people
now have the full ability to defend themselves.''
   Pat indicated that Thailand's backing would continue until
Vietnam's withdrawal could be proved and external military aid from
all sides was halted. The Soviet Union is the major weapons
supplier for the Phnom Penh side.

<TEXT>
   Three Mafia figures convicted in the rubout
of a 350-pound mob-linked businessman and a plot to kill John
Gotti, reputed boss of the rival Gambino crime family, drew at
least 75 years in prison each.
   The sentences imposed Tuesday ``removed some very dangerous and
evil organized crime figures from the public,'' said Michael
Chertoff, first assistant U.S. attorney.
   U.S. District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry sentenced Louis A.
``Bobby'' Manna and Martin ``Motts'' Casella to 80 years in prison
and Richard ``Bocci'' DeSciscio to 75 years. They were convicted in
June of racketeering.
   The government said Manna, 60, of Jersey City was the Genovese
crime family's consigliere, or No. 3 leader. Casella, 72, of
Hoboken, was described as Manna's chief lieutenant in running New
Jersey rackets. DeSciscio, 47, of Bayonne, was called a hitman for
the family.
   They must serve about 60 years before becoming eligible for
parole.
   The judge said the evidence ``fairly shrieked of the defendants'
guilt.''
   ``I can't say I've seen anybody more implacable and more
relentless as a professional criminal than Mr. Manna,'' said
Chertoff, who also prosecuted the 1986 Commission case in New York
that led to 100-year prison terms for the Mafia top bosses. ``In
the face of this awesome criminality, you almost lose the capacity
to speak.''
   Manna, in his usual elegant dark suit, stared straight ahead,
his head high. He instructed defense attorney Raymond A. Brown only
to repeat assertions of innocence.
   Also sentenced were Rocco J. Napoli, 43, of Secaucus, a Laborers
union official, who received a term of six years and three months,
and Frank ``Dipsy'' Daniello, 68, a former Hoboken police
lieutenant, who got four years.
   Manna was also fined $250,000, and Casella and Napoli were fined
$25,000 each.
   All the defendants were found guilty of racketeering conspiracy,
and all but Daniello were convicted of racketeering and illegal
gambling.
   All but Napoli were convicted in the Gotti plot; Manna, Casella
and DeSciscio were convicted in the slaying of the mob-linked
businessman, Irwin Schiff. Napoli was convicted of illegal labor
payoffs.
   The trial included tapes of Manna, Casella and DeSciscio
discussing a plot to kill Gotti and his brother in what authorities
said was a power struggle between the nation's most powerful Mafia
families.
   The FBI warned the Gottis, and no attempt on their lives was
reported.
   Schiff was shot in 1987 in a New York restaurant. The government
said he may have been killed because he threatened to expose
Genovese activity or could no longer be trusted with a more than
$25 million money-laundering operation.

   A jury has ordered a supermarket to pay
$50,000 to a man who slipped on a green bean while shopping.
   Luther Turner, 48, injured his head and back in the fall at a
Winn-Dixie in 1986 and ran up more than $2,000 in doctors' bills,
according to court records.
   He contended the supermarket was negligent; the store claimed
Turner wasn't watching where he was walking.
   Winn-Dixie will appeal unless the damages awarded Tuesday are
reduced or overturned, said attorney David Moore.

<HEAD>Moscow Arms Envoy Cautious on Pre-Summit Treaty Chances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is too early to tell whether a treaty that
would halve U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear arsenals will be
ready for a superpower summit next year, Moscow's chief envoy to
the arms talks said today.
   On the eve of a new round of negotiations, Yuri Nazarkin said
that after last week's concessions by the Soviet Union, the most
difficult remaining issue involves air-launched cruise missiles.
   He said he will await U.S. reaction to the Soviet moves, which
include a proposal on the missiles, before assessing chances for
completing a draft Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
   ``I wouldn't dare to forecast the prospect of the negotiations
from the point of view of the forthcoming summit,'' Nazarkin said
at a news conference. ``We still expect the American reaction here
in Geneva.''
   But an accord between President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for a summit in the first half of 1990
``reflects the confidence of the sides that major agreement and
substantial progress are possible,'' Nazarkin said in a prepared
statement.
   He said the outstanding points on the air-launched cruise
missiles include their allowed range and how to deal with bombers
carrying cruise missiles tipped with conventional rather than
nuclear warheads.
   His remarks were similar to others by senior officials on both
sides who have said an agreement is within reach but that remaining
obstacles should not be underestimated.
   Talks began in March 1985 on a treaty aimed at reducing U.S. and
Soviet long-range nuclear forces by 30 percent to 50 percent. Both
sides have already agreed to ceilings of 6,000 nuclear warheads and
1,600 delivery vehicles _ missiles and bombers with which each
superpower can strike the other directly.
   The talks are to resume Thursday when delegation officials
discuss how the session will be organized. Nazarkin and U.S. chief
envoy Richard Burt are to meet Friday, and the first full meeting
of both delegations is set for Monday.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze met in Wyoming over the weekend and
Moscow removed a long-standing obstacle in the talks by announcing
it would not let its objections to U.S. plans for space-based
missile defenses block the signing of a treaty.
   Under the new Soviet position, U.S. tests involving the
Strategic Defense Initiative ``connected with research'' would be
permitted, but not trials of ``systems or prototypes,'' Nazarkin
said.
   The Soviets also agreed to a U.S. demand for not including
sea-based cruise missiles under the weapons ceilings of a treaty.
Washington says the rockets cannot be monitored reliably.
   The two sides also agreed on certain anti-cheating measures for
the proposed treaty.
   Earlier, the Bush administration said it would drop its demand
for a ban on mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles, provided
Congress approves funding for such missiles. The Soviets have them
but the United States does not.

   A bank robber making a getaway took four
employees hostage, then ordered them to lie side by side in a field
and drove his car over two of them, killing one and seriously
injuring another, police said.
   The other hostages escaped without injury as the man shot at
them.
   A suspect, described as in his early 20s, was arrested Tuesday
at a roadblock between Kalamazoo and Battle Creek and awaited
arraignment today.
   His name was withheld pending the filing of formal charges.
   The gunman, wearing a hood, met the employees at the First
Federal Bank of Michigan branch in Perry as they arrived for work
and took an undisclosed amount of cash when the vault opened at 9
a.m., said State Police Lt. John Fiedler.
   He drove away after forcing the four into his car, but returned
to the scene minutes later. He ordered three of the employees to
get into a car and follow him, keeping one with him to ensure the
others followed, police said.
   The two cars pulled over north of Battle Creek, and the gunman
and his hostages drove in one car about three miles to Assyria
Township, police said.
   The man ordered all four employees to lie on the edge of a
field, then tried to back his car over them, hitting two, Fiedler
said. The others ran.
   Killed was Marilyn Parks, 55, of Owosso. Betty Green of Perry
was listed in serious but stable condition today at Ingham Medical
Center in Lansing.
   Cash and a handgun were found in the suspect's car, Fiedler said.

<HEAD>Jackie Mason Says Dinkins Doesn't Merit Jewish Support</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comic Jackie Mason says Jewish guilt could help
Democrat David Dinkins become mayor, the Village Voice reported
today.
   ``There is a sick Jewish problem of voting for a black man no
matter how unfit he is for the job,'' the weekly quoted the
rabbi-turned-comedian as saying.
   The remarks were heard by a Voice writer who said he sat with
the star of television's ``Chicken Soup'' at an Italian Welfare
League benefit at which Republican mayoral candidate Rudolph
Giuliani received an award.
   Mason, who has made appearances and a TV commercial in support
of Giuliani, told the New York Post that the remarks were taken out
of context and that some were meant to be taken humorously.
   The newspaper quoted Mason as saying Dinkins ``looks like a
black model without a job'' and that ``if Dinkins was white and you
put his track record against Giuliani's track record, he wouldn't
get a single Jewish vote.''
   ``All you have to do is to be black and don't curse the Jews
directly and the Jew will vote for a black in a second,'' Mason
said. ``Jews are sick with complexes. They feel guilty for the
black predicament as if the Jews caused it. Jews have always
marched for the blacks. Jews have always supported all their
hospitals, their causes.
   ``The Jews are constantly giving millions of dollars to the
black people. Have you ever heard of a black person giving a
quarter to a Jew?'' Mason asked.
   ``There are plenty of poor Jews in the world. ... I'm not saying
blacks should be giving to the Jews, but Jews don't owe anything to
blacks.''
   Giuliani said he had not read the article and would not comment
until he had.

<HEAD>PEN Says Rushdie Case Not Isolated Incident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie is not the only author vilified
for writing about topics that upset Moslems, the PEN international
writers association says.
   ``There is a new threat to freedom of expression,'' Alexander
Blokh, PEN's international secretary, said Tuesday.
   Iranian radical Moslem clerics offered a multimillion dollar
bounty for the death of Rushdie, whose book ``The Satanic Verses''
was thought by many Moslems to be blasphemous.
   While protesting the campaign waged against Rushdie, Blokh said
his group became aware of other writers living abroad who face
``pressures, intimidation, sometimes direct threats'' because of
their work.
   PEN, the International Association of Poets, Playwrights,
Editors and Novelists, is holding its world congress this week in
Toronto and Montreal. It recommended that its member chapters
invite writers in the Islamic community to discuss such situations,
their causes and the means to find a solution.
   ``We would ask them to come and very discreetly tell us their
story if they want to,'' Blokh said at a news conference that
concluded the Toronto portion of the conference.
   ``They are at certain moments in a state of terror,'' he said.
``He (a writer) can be in a very free city ... and yet he lives in
a very permanent state of terror, discreet terror.''
   Blokh, who lives in Paris, said he also learned of a similar
case in Moscow.
   ``I'm not going to tell you any concrete cases because they are
still quite secret,'' he said.
   Blokh said only the Rushdie case was known to have ``official
status,'' issued by a government, but other incidents of
``religious fanaticism'' certainly could be considered a new threat
to freedom of expression that came as a surprise at the end of the
20th century.
   He said the new form of censorship discovered only recently was
``something for which we're not prepared.''
   The threats were coming not from a government but from a ``very
hard to define'' community, he said.
   The group's recommendation on intolerance and fanaticism, as
translated by The Associated Press from a French copy, said the
Rushdie incident ``is not isolated and revealed many other
pressures, happily less grave, but equally as unacceptable for
freedom of expression.''
   It said the pressures might be exercised through diplomatic,
family, community, religious or terrorist routes ``by governmental
authorities or others in the name of Islam.''
   Blokh said the association wanted to be careful not to appear
racist in discussing the situation but wants its members ``to study
together our possible reaction and how we should face this new
threat to freedom of expression.''
   The association also recommended increased contacts between
writers from Western and Eastern European countries, with a first
session planned next year in Vienna, Austria, to work toward
exchanging information that may have been missed during the past 40
years of limited contacts.
   A new Russian Soviet chapter based in Moscow is attending the
conference for the first time. PEN had kept out the Soviet Union
for 65 years because of its persecution of writers and other
intellectuals, and Moscow had regarded the authors' group as
anti-Communist.
   PEN, founded in 1921, has 11,000 members in more than 90
chapters organized along language lines. The international
association of poets, playwrights, editors, essayists and novelists
campaigns actively to free writers who have been imprisoned.

<HEAD>Communist Party Rebukes Ministers for Failure to Supply Consumer
Goods</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party has rebuked two government
ministers for failing to produce and deliver basic consumer goods,
including soap, clothing and shoes, the newspaper Pravda said today.
   The report said that 88 percent of basic consumer goods were
generally not available, mainly because of ministerial
mismanagement.
   ``Out of 276 basic consumer goods, 243 cannot be found in shops,
including soap, toothpaste, razor blades, notebooks, pencils,
clothing and shoes,'' Pravda said.
   ``Checks show that a number of ministers are still using old
approaches to planning and financing production of consumer
goods,'' it said.
   The chronic shortage of consumer goods, which has worsened over
the past several years despite the economic restructuring initiated
by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, has top billing during the
current session of the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   In an effort to stem the shortages, the Central Committee
ordered the Party Control Committee to find out which party members
in the Council of Ministers were responsible, Pravda said.
   ``The committee considered the issue of the issue of party
responsibility of a number of Communists, heads of standing
committees of the Council of Ministers, ministries and departments,
who are guilty of frustrating the production of consumer goods and
unsatisfactory supplies of these goods to the population,'' Pravda
said.
   Reprimanded as a result of the investigation were Vladimir
Gusev, the minister responsible for chemical and timber industries,
and V. Lakhtin, who is in charge of social development, Pravda said.
   ``Gusev was reprimanded for committing errors, failing to take
necessary measures for providing basic consumer goods,'' the report
said, and Lakhtin was reprimanded for ``failing to take measures to
increase deliveries of basic consumer goods.''
   Several lower-ranking ministers also were reprimanded for their
failure to get goods to the market in response to consumer demands,
Pravda said.
   An official reprimand, which goes into a party member's
permanent file, is considered a serious punishment and weighs
heavily in any decision regarding the member's future in the party.

   Vice President Dan Quayle called
Wednesday for talks on U.S. military bases and said most Filipinos
``want us to stay.'' He said the slaying of two Americans was a
cowardly terrorist act.
   A senior Philippine official said President Corazon Aquino had
accepted the U.S. offer to begin talks in December on whether to
extend the leases on six military bases. The leases expire in
September 1991.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse 2,000 leftists near the
presidential palace who refused to end an anti-bases rally.
Officials said at least 10 police were injured as protesters hurled
stones and homemade bombs.
   At least 157 people were arrested today for joining anti-Quayle
rallies.
   On Tuesday, suspected Communist guerrillas ambushed and killed
two American civilians who were working near a U.S. base north of
the capital. In response, U.S. officials banned non-essential
travel between bases by the 40,000 American troops, civilian
employees and military dependents in the Philippines.
   Quayle called the killings ``cowardly murders'' that would
``only serve to strengthen'' U.S. support for Mrs. Aquino.
   Later, he told U.S. troops and their families that he was
convinced ``a majority of the people in the Philippines want us to
stay. Let me be direct: terrorists will not drive Americans from
the Philippines.''
   The attack occurred shortly before Quayle arrived to discuss
extending the leases of the six U.S. military installations, among
the largest such bases outside the continental United States.
   After a one-hour meeting with Mrs. Aquino early Wednesday, he
said he delivered a letter from President Bush suggesting talks
begin in December on the future of Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay
naval base and four smaller installations.
   ``She read the letter,'' Quayle said. ``She responded that she
will be making an appropriate response. ... I had a very positive
impression from Mrs. Aquino regarding the relationship between the
United States and the Philippines.''
   There was no formal announcement from the Philippines on whether
Mrs. Aquino agreed to the proposal. But presidential Executive
Secretary Catalino Macaraig told The Associated Press Bush's offer
was accepted and that written confirmation would be handed to
Quayle before he leaves Thursday for Malaysia.
   Asked why no announcement had been made, Macaraig replied:
``When you're being courted, you have to be coy.''
   Opposition to the bases is mounting in the Philippines. Mrs.
Aquino, who is to visit Washington in November, has offered new
talks on the issue but refuses to say whether she will support an
extension.
   A Filipino official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
did not want to discuss the bases in detail during her Washington
visit.
   Quayle told reporters: ``I hope that the people of the
Philippines understand and appreciate not only the special
relationship, the sense of stability that the facilities offer,
stability in the political sense, stability in the economic sense,
stability in the sense of hopefully seeing expanded economic
opportunities and development to the people of the Philippines.''
   After meetings with Mrs. Aquino and other officials, Quayle flew
to Subic 50 miles northwest of Manila and to Clark, 50 miles north
of the capital, before returning for a state banquet.
   At Clark, he met briefly with the widow of one of the slain
Americans, William H. Thompson, 45. Officials said the widow of the
other American, Donald G. Buchner, 44, was eight months pregnant
and too distraught to attend. The two worked at Camp O'Donnell, an
Air Force station near Clark.
   Outside Clark, police prevented about 500 leftists from marching
to the main gate. They held a rally about a half mile from the
gate, where speakers called for the bases to be closed.
   Any new agreement must be ratified by two-thirds of the
23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition to the installations
is strong.
   During a courtesy call on Senate President Jovito Salonga,
Quayle urged senators to ``remove the emotionalism'' from
discussions about the bases. Salonga said Quayle asked that the
Philippines consider the security and economic implications of the
bases during the talks.
   The bases provide jobs to about 70,000 Filipinos, paying more
than $96 million annually in civilian salaries.
   Quayle told reporters he and Mrs. Aquino had spoken of the
killings.
   ``President Aquino and I agreed that these killings were
unfortunately timed for my visit,'' he said. ``But we also agreed
that this would not drive a wedge between our two countries, that
our countries will have a special relationship.''
   Presidential spokesman Noel Tolentino said later that the
killings ``will not alter the friendly relations between the two
countries.''
   The ambush victims were employees of Ford Aerospace Corp., which
contracts to maintain an electronic warfare training range at Camp
O'Donnell.

<TEXT>
   More than 230 people arrived in southern
Japan today in a 50-ton wooden boat, many of them believed to be
Chinese seeking jobs, not asylum, in Asia's wealthiest nation.
   The boat people were the first to land in Japan since an
unprecedented influx forced the government two weeks ago to tighten
its policy on who will be accepted as refugees, officials said.
   The new arrivals, who appeared tired but healthy, were the fifth
group to be brought ashore in Okinawa, Japan's southernmost
prefecture, since August, said Kazuyoh Sameshima, a spokesman in
Naha for the Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard. It was
the largest group of refugees this year.
   Sameshima said 231 people were crowded aboard the boat, which a
coast guard ship escorted into port at Naha, Okinawa's capital,
1,000 miles from Tokyo.
   Though most were young men, about 12 children were aboard,
Sameshima said. Young mothers could be seen cradling babies as
immigration officials began herding them on to buses. Most refused
to answer reporters' questions.
   Sameshima refused to comment on whether they were Vietnamese.
But he said the boat originally had departed from Vietnam and
stopped in China because of typhoon damage. A new boat brought the
group from China to Japan.
   A Vietnamese interpreter who requested anonymity said that
although some of the passengers spoke Vietnamese, most appeared to
be Chinese.
   After being checked by immigration officials, the arrivals were
taken to a nearby university, where they were to spend the night on
a gymnasium floor. Officials said they would be transferred soon to
an immigration center that is already filled to three times its
normal capacity.
   So far this year, 2,950 Vietnamese boat people have arrived in
Japan, compared with 219 in all of 1988.
   On Sept. 13, Japan began a policy of screening boat people,
accepting those deemed to be fleeing political persecution but
refusing permission for economic migrants to stay.
   Today's arrivals were the first since then, said an official at
the Refugee Division of the Justice Ministry in Tokyo.
   He said if immigration authorities determine Indochinese among
the boat people had fled their homeland for economic reasons, they
would be detained until accepted back in their home country or in a
third country.
   If they are not Indochinese, they are not eligible for refugee
status and will be repatriated, the Foreign Ministry has said.

<TEXT>
   Seven white policemen demanding ``a level
playing field'' are suing over a 1979 court-ordered affirmative
plan that they say unfairly promoted less-qualified minorities
ahead of them.
   It could be the first test of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling
that gives municipal employees the right to challenge
court-approved, preferential employment practices.
   The suit, filed Monday in Superior Court, claims the seven
officers are the victim of racial quotas. It maintains that the
city has violated a state civil rights law against the use of race
or sex in hiring and promotion.
   Robert Gyemant, the attorney for the officers, said his clients
should not be forced to pay the price to right wrongs carried out
before any of them were involved with the department.
   ``All we are saying is why make our clients pay for it,'' he
said.
   He said his clients only want ``a level playing field.''
   The suit seeks back pay, punitive damages and an end to the
alleged discrimination. The amount of damages sought was not
disclosed.
   Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that white
firefighters hired in Birmingham, Ala., after a consent decree was
approved could fight the preferential promotion of allegedly less
qualified black firefighters.
   In San Francisco, city figures show that when the court plan was
adopted in 1979 there were 1,590 officers, with 85.8 percent
non-minority, 14.2 percent minority, 95.8 percent male and 4.2
percent female.
   As of Sept. 12, there were 1,777 officers: 71.6 were
non-minority, 28.4 percent minority, 89.8 percent male and 10.2
percent female.

   The country's deeply split
Communist leadership today asked Slovenia's legislature to postpone
a vote on constitutional changes that would spell out the
republic's right to secede.
   But Miran Potrc, president of Slovenia's parliament, said
Slovenians ``are determined'' to go ahead with the amendments and
media reports said lawmakers would almost certainly approve the
package.
   ``The Slovenian parliament is the only legal institution that
can decide on such crucial matters,'' Potrc said during a
legislative session today in the regional capital, Ljubljana.
   Besides declaring Slovenia's right to secede, the changes place
strict controls on the use of army units in the republic and
restrict imposition of martial law there by Yugoslavia's collective
eight-member presidency.
   But after a 17-hour debate that lasted into today, the country's
policy-setting Communist Party Central Committee voted 97-40 to
call on Slovenian Communists to ``postpone the adoption of the
amendments in question.''
   Delegates to the hurriedly convened Belgrade session said
passage of the amendments might lead to military intervention in
Slovenia, the richest and most Western-oriented of Yugoslavia's six
republics.
   And there were sharp exchanges between delegates from Slovenia
and Serbia, home to the national capital, Belgrade.
   Serbia, the largest of the republics, advocates transforming
Yugoslavia from a loose federation to a more unified nation by
limiting regional rights. Serbian delegates said that the changes
would open the way to eventual dissolution of the Yugoslav
federation.
   The Slovenian leadership said Tuesday, however, that the
amendments in no way contradict the federal constitution.
   ``We are convinced that the changes will only serve to
strengthen, and not to threaten, the concept of Yugoslavia as a
free, democratic and equitable community of peoples,'' Potrc said.
   As he spoke, 2,000 workers of a construction company in
Titograd, capital of the southern republic of Montenegro, went into
the streets today to protest ``the impending adoption of the
controversial amendments,'' the official Tanjug news agency
reported.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and party structure. Serbia
is the largest republic and Kosovo and Vojvodina provinces are part
of it but not fully subject to its control.
   The decentralized system of government and collective federal
presidency were devised in 1974 to prevent one republic from
gaining sway over the others, but it has resulted in an ineffective
government by compromise.
   Milan Kucan, head of the Slovenian Communist Party, said the
Central Committee debate on the issue amounted to ``a restriction
of the sovereign will of the Slovenian people.''
   ``Slovenian communists will choose (to defend) the interests of
the Slovenian people (rather than) becoming quislings,'' Kucan said.
   Ivo Druzic, a Central Committee member from Croatia, warned that
should the military intervene to prevent the changes ``this would
mean the compromising of the army command which would (be seen as)
suspending the constitution instead of defending it.''
   But a military representative, Adm. Petar Simic, said, ``the
Yugoslav army was not a ... mercenary army that would allow anyone
to use it as they see fit.''
   Janez Kocijancic, a Slovenian businessman, referring to the June
military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in China, asked
whether ``anyone wishes to expand Tiananmen Square to the gates of
Trieste,'' an Italian city on the Yugoslav border.
   Slovenia is the country's smallest but most economically
developed republic, accounting for more than 20 percent of the
national product and 30 percent of hard currency exports.
   Its population, however, represents just eight percent of the
country's total.
   Belgrade radio reported that Janez Drnovsek, a Slovene who
currently heads Yugoslavia's collective presidency, cut short his
visit to the United Nations and was expected back in Slovenia today.

   The soldiers known for inflicting
stress on recruits often feel stress themselves, and Fort Benning
plans to make sure they can handle it.
   Drill sergeants will undergo a stress management program
designed to avoid trainee and spouse abuse.
   Officials at Fort Benning denied the program was prompted by a
February incident that left 39 basic-training soldiers hospitalized.
   The soldiers suffered from a breakdown of muscle associated with
physical exertion. The ailment can cause kidney failure. After the
incident, 27 officers were reassigned from the Infantry Center.
   ``Drill sergeant duty is a little bit different than other
duty,'' said Sgt. Maj. William Mayo of the Infantry Training Center
Command. ``They have long hours and their job is dealing with
people all the time _ and doing the same job all the time.''
   Mayo said the program has been implemented at Fort Sill, Okla.,
and Fort Leonard Wood, Mo., and has lowered the number of trainee
abuse cases there.
   He said the program will try to show the sergeants and their
wives the stresses of working 14 hours a day for the two years they
serve as drill sergeants. He noted that the wives seldom see their
husbands during that time.

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said
today the Senate's refusal to put an additional $300 million into
Star Wars reflects a growing sentiment toward reining in the
missile-defense shield.
   ``I think there is a growing recognition ... that we have to
reduce our expectations and level of resources committed to it,''
Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters. He said the Senate vote ``was a
strong indication of concern in that regard.''
   By a vote of 66-34 Tuesday, the Senate turned aside a
Republican-backed attempt to restore funds to Star Wars, formally
known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, to a level closer to the
$4.5 billion approved by the Senate in its authorization bill last
month.
   Mitchell said the vote amounted to a major blow to the program.
Then-President Reagan proposed Star Wars six years ago, hailing it
as a nuclear-age antidote to a strike against the United States.
   The funding level adopted in the $288 billion appropriations
bill totals about $4.1 billion _ $3.7 billion for the Pentagon's
program and $355 million in Energy Department and military
construction money. That amount falls $900 million short of what
Bush requested for the program in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who are
negotiating with House members on a final defense authorization
bill, said the chamber's votes undermine chances that Star Wars
spending will be higher than the $4.1 billion spent in fiscal 1989.
   The House this year approved a defense blueprint that earmarks
$3.1 billion for Star Wars.
   ``There isn't any question that SDI is extremely weak. It looks
to me now that it will be under last year's level when we get out
of conference,'' Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said shortly after the
Senate action.
   ``It's continuing the downward pressure,'' said Sen. Tim Wirth,
D-Colo. ``There's an increase in the effort to make it a research
program, where it belongs.''
   Lawmakers said the Soviet Union's announcement this weekend that
it would separate Star Wars from negotiations on a treaty to reduce
strategic arms may have taken steam out of the drive to increase
SDI spending.
   ``SDI has now been cut loose,'' Sen. John Warner of Virginia,
ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee.
   But some members said that since Star Wars was also one of
several items in an $8.5 billion amendment to the spending bill,
the Senate vote was not a clearcut referendum on the program.
   ``This was not pro-SDI or anti-SDI,'' said Sen. William Cohen,
R-Maine, a member of the Armed Services panel. ``They put in Apache
helicopters, the space program, sealift.''
   The amendment with the increased Star Wars spending, introduced
by Warner and Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., would have also restored
$910 million for the submarine-based, long-range Trident 2 nuclear
missile and reduced funds for the Apache helicopter.
   In other action, the Senate:
   _Rejected, 71-29, an amendment that would have cut $2.7 billion
from Bush's request for $4.7 billion next year to buy and test the
first 13 models of the B-2 stealth bomber.
   _Overwhelmingly endorsed a cost-saving plan to shut down 86
military bases and scale back five more. The vote was 86-14.
   _Approved, 65-34, a non-binding resolution calling on Bush to
report to Congress before April 1, 1990 on the U.S. military's
presence in South Korea. Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., had proposed a
reduction of 3,000 in the 43,800 U.S. troops stationed in the Asian
nation, but the sense of Congress measure prevailed.
   _Approved the transfer of $135 million from the Defense
Department to the Energy Department for the restart of the three
tritium reactors at the Savannah River nuclear plant.
   _Provided $20 million in military assistance for Jordan. This
amendment was introduced at the request of Bush and approved by
voice vote.
   _Approved aid to repair and rebuild military facilities in the
Caribbean and United States damaged last week by Hurricane Hugo.
The total cost of the aid plan was not immediately available but
Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the plan's sponsor, said $50 million
was for a Navy shipyard in Charleston and $25 million was for Shaw
Air Force Base.

<TEXT>
   Rain and illnesses worsened the
plight of hundreds of East German refugees crowding the West German
Embassy compound, but more newcomers kept scaling the fence of the
mission's garden today.
   According to the refugees who talked to reporters, the number of
people thronging the compound had reached 1,500 by midday.
   Only 177 of them were said to have left Tuesday and today,
accepting an East German government offer of guaranteed emigration
within six months if they return home.
   In talks with the refugees Tuesday, East German emissary
Wolfgang Vogel, a confidant of Communist leader Erich Honecker,
said those willing to return could emigrate without facing
prosecution for ``flight from the republic'' and other offenses.
   The emissary was evidently seeking to persuade larger numbers of
refugees to accept the government offer, but the majority
apparently remained skeptical.
   Some of the refugees told reporters that the crowd inside
contained ``a lot of people with a criminal record, people who are
not politically motivated'' to emigrate from East Germany.
   In an effort to accommodate the swelling crowd, several hundred
beds today were made available by the West German army.
   Nevertheless, living conditions in the compound were getting
ever more precarious for the refugees, most of them housed in Red
Cross tents.
   Several of the more than 250 children were said to have fallen
ill with diarrhea and colds following heavy rain that set in during
the night.
   ``We are humans, not animals, aren't we? They cannot let us rot
away here, can they?'' a man asked Western reporters talking to him
through the fence.
   ``I don't accept the (East German) offer. I leave here only to
the West or in a coffin,'' said a mother of three.
   The number of East German refugees in Bonn's mission in Warsaw
was reported to have reached 400.
   After holding inconclusive talks with his Czechoslovak
counterpart, West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher
was to confer with his East German colleague Oskar Fischer at the
United Nations in New York.
   The East German flood to the West occurred after Hungary opened
its borders and allowed up to 20,000 East Germans in that country
to flee into Austria. East Germany and Czechoslovakia are hard-line
Communist bloc nations, unlike Hungary which is embracing liberal
reforms and closer ties to the West.

   An inexpensive drug used to treat
bronchitis appeared to block production of the AIDS virus in
test-tube experiments, researchers said.
   The researchers cautioned against human use of the drug until
the outcome of further study.
   The drug is not a cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
scientists at Stanford University said Tuesday in announcing
results of lab tests.
   But they said it could slow down the virus' assault on the
immune system, as well as prolong and improve the patient's quality
of life when used with AZT or other drugs approved for treating
AIDS.
   Unlike Compound Q, a sometimes toxic protein distilled from a
Chinese cucumber root, dextran sulfate from Japan or high-priced
AZT, the drug under study at Stanford is readily available and
relatively cheap and safe.
   ``I am really optimistic about this,'' said Dr. Leonore
Herzenberg, a professor of genetics at Stanford, who worked on the
research with her husband, geneticist Dr. Leonard Herzenberg.
   ``Looking at the scientific evidence for what this drug does,
and the scientific evidence for how AIDS works, our guess is that
treatment with this drug may be quite good. But until we get it
tested in patients, we won't know if it will work.''
   The drug, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), is used for treating chronic
bronchitis and other lung ailments, and as an antidote to overdoses
of acetaminophen, the ingredient in Tylenol and other
over-the-counter pain relievers. The drug is made by the Zambon
Group in Italy and is available in liquid form in the United States
and in tablet form in Europe. Bristol-Myers Co. makes a vaporized
formula with the drug called Mucomist.
   Mrs. Herzenberg warned that AIDS patients should not begin
taking the drug in any form before further experiments show whether
the drug works on AIDS in humans.
   ``We're moving as quickly as possible and we are now talking
with physicians about doing clinical tests,'' she said.
   Dr. Mervyn Silverman, president of the American Foundation for
AIDS Research, said the experiments sounded promising, but he also
urged caution.
   ``While I think this holds promise, we have to have ... tests on
humans before we know how effective it will be,'' Silverman said.
   NAC blocks the triggering of AIDS virus production by increasing
glutathione levels in blood cells affected by the virus, the
Herzenbergs said. Glutathione eliminates potentially harmful
oxidizing agents and is essential for energy generation and other
cell functions.
   The Herzenbergs are scheduled to report preliminary results of
the research today at an international conference exploring
research strategies on AIDS in Geneva.

<HEAD>Mitchell Urges White House to Suspend Restrictions on Soviet Trade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell accused
President Bush today of being ``overly timid'' and urged him to
suspend trade restrictions with the Soviet Union as a reward for
permitting freer emigration.
   Mitchell called for the temporary waiver of the Jackson-Vanik
amendment which links non-discriminatory trade treatment by the
United States with the freedom of Soviet citizens to leave their
country at will.
   The Democratic leader noted that more than 100,000 people have
been permitted to leave the Soviet Union since the beginning of the
year and that as many as 50,000 more have received permission to
depart.
   ``This indisputable rise in Soviet emiagration is a step that
deserves an American response,'' Mitchell told the Senate. ``The
response quite clearly should be the conditional lifting of
impediments to trade imposed by the Jackson-Vanik amendment.''
   The Jackson-Vanik amendment was adopted by Congress in 1974 at
the height of the Cold War. Named for its principal sponsors, the
late Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash., and former Rep. Charles A.
Vanik, D-Ohio, the amendment bars the extension of trade credits
and the granting of most-favored nation trade status to communist
nations which deny citizens the freedom to emigrate.
   Mitchell noted that the law permits the president to waive the
amendment if he determines Soviet citizens are no longer denied the
right to leave or if such a waiver will promote freedom of
emigration.
   He said lifting the amendment would not automatically confer
dramatic trade benefits, that a U.S.-Soviet commercial agreement
would be needed to do that, and that trade would continue to be
limited by a lack of demand for Soviet products.
   ``But Jackson-Vanik is of tremendous symbolic importance,''
Mitchell said, noting that Soviet leaders have long cited it as an
obstacle to closer relations.
   Bush has said he will consider waiving the amendment only when
the Soviets formally change their emigration laws and when the
results of that change are seen to be both visible and permament.
   ``I believe this is an overly timid approach,'' Mitchell said,
declaring that Soviet emigration levels are now three times what
they were in 1979, the previous high-water mark.
   ``If the president temporarily waives Jackson-Vanik, he loses
nothing; he can only win,'' Mitchell said.
   ``He can refuse to renew it should the Soviets restrict
emigration or refuse to codify their emigration laws _ and I would
be among the first to urge him to do so,'' the majority leader said.
   Waiving the law now would conform with the intent of the
amendment, provide a ``carrot and stick'' to influence the future
of Soviet emigration, and demonstrate that U.S.-Soviet trade is
primarily limited by the failure of the Soviet economic system, not
by U.S. actions, he said.
   ``It is disappointing that the president has failed to recognize
that the goals of Jackson-Vanik have been met,'' Mitchell said.
   ``President Bush should accept victory and respond accordingly.''

   Investigators in the crash of a USAir jet that
skidded off a runway into the East River last week are looking into
reports that the cockpit crew was at a bar hours before takeoff,
the New York Post said today.
   Detectives were trying to find the hotel bartender who was
working Sept. 20 before the Boeing 737-400 crashed at LaGuardia
Airport, the newspaper reported, citing sources it did not
identify. Two passengers died in the accident.
   In another development, a grand jury was assembled Tuesday to
hear testimony about the crash.
   Prosecutors said Monday that Capt. Michael W. Martin and
co-pilot Constantine Kleissas tested negative for alcohol, but the
urine samples were taken 48 hours after the accident. Experts said
alcohol consumed two days earlier would probably not show up anyway.
   Questions about drinking were raised by Eric Trendal, the
husband of a USAir employee, who told authorities he had been out
``bouncing'' with the captain and the co-pilot. He said he was with
them at a bar in the Marriott Hotel between 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m.
Wednesday. The flight crashed at 11:29 p.m.
   Investigators want to find out what Trendal means by
``bouncing.'' They said they believe it means ``drinking'' or ``bar
hopping,'' the Post said.
   A detective close to the investigation told the Post it is
believed the crew spent as many as five hours of their six-hour
layover in bars near the airport.
   Frederick Hafetz, an attorney for the pilots, refused to comment
on the grand jury investigation, begun by the Queens district
attorney's office.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, conducting its own
probe, reported Tuesday tha investigators found that almost all of
the tread on the jet's front tires was gone.
   That was consistent with the pilot's statements that he had
tried to halt the jet before it hit the water, said NTSB spokesman
Ted Lopatkiewicz.

<TEXT>
   The ``CBS Evening News'' aired fake combat
footage and false news reports of the war in Afghanistan in the
mid-1980s, the New York Post reported today. CBS declined immediate
comment.
   Howard Stringer, a top CBS corporate official who formerly was
executive producer of the program, said he would look into the
matter.
   Most of the questioned footage was shot by Mike Hoover, 45, a
free-lance cameraman who the Post said staged scenes of guerrilla
sabotage and made a Chinese-made Pakistani jet fighter on a
training run appear to be a Soviet plane bombing Afghan villages.
   ``I'm going to have to look into it,'' said Stringer, now
president of the CBS Broadcast Group and the program's executive
producer from 1981 until January 1984, before the suspect footage
was aired.
   Stringer, himself a former documentary maker for CBS News,
declined comment on the Post story, saying he hadn't yet read it
and that its assertions ``are all news to me.''
   ``I don't know who the people involved are or who the
accusations are coming from,'' he said in a telephone interview
from Washington.
   ``We can't respond to the story until we talk to the free-lance
cameraman involved,'' said a CBS News spokesman, Tom Goodman.
   CBS anchorman Dan Rather had no immediate comment, a spokeswoman
said.
   Rather also anchored a 1987 ``CBS Reports'' documentary, ``The
Battle For Afghanistan,'' that used footage shot by Hoover that
previously had aired on the ``CBS Evening News.''
   CBS at the time said the program's footage represented 18 trips
into Afghanistan by Hoover and his crews over a three-year period.
The program included some of the footage whose authenticity was
questioned in the Post story.
   A woman who identified herself as Beverly Johnson and said she
was Hoover's wife said he was working in remote caves in New
Zealand and could not be contacted, according to the Post.
   In a Los Angeles Times interview in 1987, Hoover explained that
he would propose coverage of the fighting in Afghanistan on a
story-by-story basis to CBS, which then would either approve or
reject each proposal.
   CBS never turned him down, he said, crediting Rather as ``really
the muscle'' behind his CBS assignments to cover the war.
   In the same interview, Hoover said that he had gone to Vietnam
in 1968 on assignment for NBC. He also said he didn't consider
himself a news cameraman in the traditional sense. ``I'm really
kind of a film maker,'' he said.
   During news broadcasts on Nov. 12 and 13, 1984, Rather said
Hoover had been on hand for ``the largest sabotage operation of the
war.'' Videotape shot by Hoover showed Mujahedeen rebels
purportedly blowing up pylons to cut power to the Afghan capital of
Kabul.
   The actual sabotage, however, took place 12 days before Hoover
arrived on the scene, the Post said. Etabari, an Afghan serving as
the cameraman's translator, told the newspaper Hoover persuaded
guerrilla leaders to order about a dozen rebels to return to the
site so he could stage the sabotage.
   ``He told the Mujahedeen to destroy pylons that were already
destroyed. It was completely wrong. It was just for the movie,''
the Post quoted Etabari as saying.
   An Afghan-British journalist, Habib Kawyani, confirmed Hoover
arrived in the Pakistani border town of Peshawar too late to shoot
the actual sabotage, the Post said.
   In a Pakistani military training camp, Hoover staged rebels
stalking alleged government guards and blowing up a mine, Etabari
also said. Some footage of 4,000 Afghanis shown purportedly fleeing
their homes near Kabul actually was shot near the Afghan-Pakistani
border, Etabari said.
   The network won the Du Pont Silver Baton award for the news
segments, the Post said.
   The newspaper said CBS in 1987 also bought footage stolen from
Mohamed Salam, an Afghan journalism student under Boston University
dean Joachim Maitre. Rather reported the tape was shot by Hoover
and depicted ``the biggest one-day defeat of Soviet forces since
World War II.''
   The tape actually showed Afghan government troops under attack,
according to the Post. ``There were no Soviets there,'' said Maitre.
   Maitre said he sought and received an apology from CBS,
according to the newspaper. His office said today he was at
conference in Washington and was unavailable for comment.

   Abortion foes demonstrated at the home of a city
solicitor, who called the protest an intimidation ploy that would
not stop him from prosecuting Operation Rescue's leader on
trespassing charges.
   About 15 people gathered Tuesday night outside the home of Chief
Assistant Solicitor General Robert Lee O'Brien Jr. Police reported
no arrests.
   ``People need to know he's protecting child killers,'' said one
demonstrator, Archie Bradley of Delaware.
   Randall Terry's trial resumed as scheduled this morning, and the
prosecutor was back in court as expected.
   ``This is obviously a definite attempt to influence the way I
handle the case, and it's not going to happen,'' O'Brien said
Tuesday. ``It kind of makes me a little angry that they would come
to my private residence and do this type of thing.
   ``I will not let it interfere with my job,'' he said. ``It's not
appropriate for them to try to intimidate a prosecutor who's trying
to do his job.''
   Tuesday night's demonstration followed the start of Terry's
trial, which stems from protests outside abortion clinics during
the 1988 Democratic National Convention.
   O'Brien objected in court when Terry told jurors that the
demonstrations were held last year to save children from abortion.
   Judge John Bruner ruled that Terry could not use justification
as a defense in his trial on criminal trespass and unlawful
assembly charges.
   Terry, who is representing himself, is among about 60
anti-abortion demonstrators scheduled for trial. Only a few are
expected to be tried in the next few weeks.
   If convicted, Terry could be sentenced to a one year in jail and
fined $1,000 on each misdemeanor charge.
   Terry told jurors that while prosecutors made it seem ``like
this is a fairly open and shut case ... I mean to show you ... we
had no intention to break the law. Our only intention was to save
children from abortion.''
   O'Brien objected, saying abortion was not the issue. With the
jury absent, he said justification is a proper defense only when a
person believes he must use force or threat to defend himself
against the use of force by another.
   ``He's trying to present his view that abortion is not right ...
(but) in this state, abortion is legal,'' the prosecutor said.
   Terry countered, ``I'm not talking about a justification defense
(but) what was in my mind.''
   Operation Rescue, based in Binghamton, N.Y., organized
anti-abortion demonstrations around the country.
   More than 1,200 arrests were made at about 20 protests at
Atlanta-area abortion clinics during the summer and fall of 1988.

   Thousands of people of all
races marched at a peaceful anti-apartheid demonstration today in
this seaside city, possibly the largest-ever authorized protest in
South Africa.
   Among the marchers were the white managing director of the
Mercedes-Benz auto manufacturing plant in East London and many of
the company's black employees, who were given the day off to
participate.
   The rally for ``justice, peace and freedom'' was organized by 20
local anti-aparthied groups as part of a nationwide protest
campaign launched in early August. The demonstrations have targeted
segregated schools, hospitals, beaches, buses and other facilities.
   Police estimated today's crowd at between 25,000 and 40,000, and
journalists at the scene gave similar estimates.
   The largest previous government-approved rally was a march in
downtown Cape Town two weeks ago by an estimated 20,000 to 25,000
people.
   In other developments, authorities released a prominent
anti-apartheid activist who had been on a hunger strike, and the
city of Johannesburg formally opened all public facitilies to
blacks.
   There have been a series of mass demonstrations across the
country since President F.W. de Klerk announced Sept. 13 that
authorities would not break up lawful, peaceful protests.
   The East London rally was led by David Russell, the Anglican
Archbishop of Grahamstown, along with other local clerics and human
rights lawyers.
   The rally clogged the entire downtown area and most shops closed
for the day. Marchers danced, chanted and sang freedom songs, and
some carried the green, gold and black flag of the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Leaders of the rally marched to the headquarters of the security
police and presented written demands that call for the release of
political prisoners, the legalization of banned opposition groups
and the lifting of the 3-year-old state of emergency.
   There was a heavy police presence at the rally, including
armored vehicles and a helicopter, but officers stood aside and no
incidents were reported.
   All the approved mass rallies in the past two weeks have been
peaceful except for some minor looting at a march last week in the
southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg. In Pretoria, police used
clubs Saturday to disperse some women trying to proceed with a
protest march that was not authorized.
   In Johannesburg, white students at Rand Afrikaans University
jeered and heckled about 200 black students who marched today to
protest the segregated dormitories. About 75 percent of the
students at the overwhelmingly white university voted last week to
maintain segregated residences, the black students said.
   In another development, authorities released a prominent
anti-apartheid activist who went on a hunger strike after being
detained without charge last month, his attorney said.
   Trevor Manuel, who was freed Tuesday, is one of the top-ranking
leaders in Cape Town of the banned United Democratic Front, the
country's largest anti-apartheid coalition.
   Manuel, who has been detained previously, was held in the
central city of Bloemfontein and refused to eat for two weeks of
his 30-day confinement, attorney Essa Moosa said.
   Before his most recent detention, Manuel was under police
restrictions that limited his movements. Moosa said he did not know
if any new restrictions had been placed on his client.
   Many activists have ignored the police orders as part of the
nationwide defiance campaign.
   The government released hundreds of detainees earlier this year
after they launched a hunger strike, and only a few dozen were
being held without charge in June and July.
   However, a human rights groups estimate that the number has
risen to about 250. More than 30,000 people have been detained
without charge for varying lengths of time under the 3-year-old
state of emergency.
   In Johannesburg, meanwhile, the city formally opened all public
facilities to blacks today after the city council voted to
desegregate buses, swimming pools and recreation centers.

   Handicapped people who occupied a federal
building for two days in a bid to get wheelchair lifts installed on
public buses ended the protest after winning a pledge of support
from the Bush administration.
   The group, the American Disabled for Accessible Public
Transportation, failed to achieve their main demand Tuesday, a
federal order requiring such lifts.
   But federal officials promised to urge Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner to meet with them.
   ``This agreement by no means resolves the problem of access. It
just brings us a step closer,'' said Mark Johnson, one of the
protest leaders who met with Steven Diaz, chief counsel for the
Urban Mass Transportation Administration.
   The protest at the Richard B. Russell Federal Building began
Monday with two dozen protesters chaining themselves to the main
doors and blocking elevators with wheelchairs. The action coincided
with Skinner's appearance at the convention of the American Public
Transportation Association.
   Authorities tried to eject the protesters Monday night, but
President Bush intervened and let about 100 spend the night inside
rather than send them out into the rain.
   On Tuesday, about 160 chanting, singing activists blocked 12 of
14 elevators. Security officers kept two elevators open by using
plant stands to keep wheelchairs away.
   Diaz told protest leaders that the Transportation Department
``cannot issue a summary order commanding immediate access
including wheelchair access for all transit. We would if we could.''
   Under an agreement between federal officials and the protesters,
Skinner will be urged to meet promptly with disabled activists to
ensure a ``principle of accessibility'' until Congress passes a law
requiring wheelchair lifts.
   In addition, the protesters may continue a ``symbolic presence''
at the building.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said wheelchair lifts on
public buses would be required under a bill Bush has endorsed.
Government officials have estimated that putting lifts on new buses
would cost $90 million a year.

<TEXT>
   Water began flowing to the homes of
thousands of San Juan residents today for the first time since
Hurricane Hugo slammed into the island nine days ago.
   Officials had expressed concern that the prolonged shortage was
posing a serious health hazard.
   The Water and Sewer Authority said 90 percent of the homes in
the city of San Juan, where one-third of Puerto Rico's 3.3 million
people live, were receiving running water today. Spokeswoman
Lilliana Rivera said most of the rest of the island also had water.
   In a school shelter in the town of Yabucoa in eastern Puerto
Rico, health officials said a month-old girl died Sunday of
salmonella. At first it was believed the baby had died of
meningitis and 40 hurricane victims housed in the same school were
given antibiotics to ward off the contagious illness.
   Health officials were concerned disease might spread from
insects and rats feeding on the piles of garbage, which contain
rotting meats, vegetables and fruits that spoiled from lack of
refrigeration in the hurricane aftermath.
   Worst hit was the San Juan metropolitan area, home to more than
half of the island's population. Two-thirds were without water
after five motors at the Carraizo Dam were damaged by Hugo's 140
mph winds.
   Health officials, concerned about the spread of disease,
launched a campaign giving residents tips on how to survive the
shortage. Radio and television broadcasts periodically remind
people to boil their drinking water.
   ``The major problem is the lack of water,'' said Patricia
Perdue, a nurse with the Red Cross. ``That and the fact that trash
is not being picked up and people can't maintain proper hygiene.''
   She said the Red Cross and other health agencies were launching
a hygiene ``educational campaign'' at 120 shelters housing
thousands of hurricane victims.
   To bathe, people have dipped into swimming pools, dived into the
ocean and kneeled beside fire hydrants. They have caught rain water
in buckets or stood for hours behind National Guard and water tank
trucks to fill plastic containers.
   Two U.S. Navy destroyers distributed 20,000 gallons of fresh
water.
   At the ritzy El San Juan hotel and Condado Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino,
owners brought in five 10,000 gallon water trucks.
   ``When you don't have water, you can't wash your hands, which is
the best way to prevent disease. So just from there, the system
breaks up,'' said Jim Maze, a nurse with the Red Cross Disasters
Health Service.
   The water shortage provoked many complaints about the bathroom
facilities at the Luiz Munoz Marin International Airport.
   ``They are so filthy, maintenance personnel must make a special
effort to get near enough to clean them,'' read an editorial
Tuesday in The San Juan Star. ``Tourists and residents are aghast.''

   President Bush told the 152-nation
International Monetary Fund today ``we must do more'' to help the
new non-communist-led government of Poland, citing ``our
self-evident stake in its success.''
   The president urged the international lending organization, and
its sister agency the World Bank, ``to work rapidly with Poland''
to help the nation restructure its economy.
   The Bush administration is supporting a $119 million package of
U.S. economic aid to Poland and another $100 million in food aid.
Congressional critics are calling for more.
   Bush told reporters after his speech it is still too early to
tell how much additional aid the United States might be willing to
give to Poland.
   ``I think the key thing now is that the Poles themselves are
working on a reform package,'' Bush said. ``We want to work with
them in every way we can, but I think it's important to see what
their plan is for economic reform.''
   Asked about an appeal by Poland for a $1 billion loan from
industrial nations, Bush said the 12-member European Community ``is
working on their side, we've been helpful on ours. So we'll see
what final figures are arrived at.''
   ``We'll do everything we can. We are committed to the success
for democracy in Poland,'' he said, speaking to a group of
reporters in the Oval Office.
   In his speech, Bush also vowed that the United States would work
with the IMF to help develop a compromise by the end of this year
to help increase the organization's funds.
   In his maiden speech to two multinational financial
organizations, Bush also called on commercial banks to carry more
of a burden in easing the troubled economies of Latin America and
other developing nations.
   ``We encourage these steps not as self-sacrifice, but as
self-interest,'' Bush said in prepared remarks. ``Success not only
will help the debtor nations. But it will also strengthen the
banks, by putting their portfolios on a sounder footing.''
   Bush's comments to the annual IMF-World Bank meeting were a
toned-down rendition of an appeal he made to a group international
bankers and financial officials Tuesday night at the White House.
   At that session, Bush lobbied hard for the Third World debt
relief proposal crafted by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
saying bankers must accept some losses on Third World loans as part
of a ``new realism.''
   The so-called Brady plan, unveiled last March, endorses
voluntary efforts on the part of commercial banks to forgive part
of the $400 billion they are owed by the largest debtor countries,
many of them in Latin America.
   However, banks have been reluctant to endorse the plan because
it requires them to partially forgive old loans, then turn around
and make new ones.
   In today's speech to the gathering of most of the world's
finance ministers, Bush said: ``There may be no greater opportunity
before us all today than the challenges of Poland and, more
broadly, Eastern Europe.''
   Bush urged the lending organizations to give special attention
to funneling Western financial aid to Poland, noting the United
States and some other Western nations had individually already come
up with aid packages.
   ``In light of clearly growing needs, the recent accession of a
Solidarity-led government, and our self-evident stake in its
success, we must do more,'' Bush said.
   ``For its part, the United States intends to be out in front of
this effort, to take advantage of this historic development and to
ensure its success,'' Bush said.
   He called recent movement toward new freedoms and toward
open-market economies both in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet
Union ``stunning.''
   ``The jury is no longer out. Look at the two economic systems
and see who has prospered and who has struggled. Let's put an end
to the economic experiment. Because history has decided,'' he said.
   Bush told the financial officials: ``A more open and humane
Soviet Union can only be in the interest of the West.''
   ``And, as we see the evidence of that reform, we can match it
with steps of our own,'' he added.
   Shortly before Bush spoke, Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said his government is offering Poland lower tariffs on
its exports to Japan in an effort to help the reform of Poland's
economy. ``We see reform in Poland as a major historical challenge
for all of us,'' he told reporters.
   The president also appealed to the financial officials,
representing rich and poor nations alike, to join forces in the war
on drugs, calling it ``a worldwide problem'' that can only be
solved by joint international action.
   ``To conceal their obscene profits, drug barons must wash their
money by cycling it through financial institutions and illegitimate
shell corporations,'' Bush said.
   ``We need tough measures to track down and confiscate the
profits of drug-related crime,'' Bush said. He reiterated the U.S.
call for all countries to ratify the United Nations Vienna
Convention, which makes money laundering a criminal and
extraditable offense.
   Bush also applauded what he said was an increased attention
being given by the World Bank to the environmental consequences of
some of its projects in developing nations. ``But there is more to
be done,'' he said.
   Bush said the nations of the world should work ``more
cooperatively'' to deal with the problems of global warming.

throughout the country:
   Sept. 26
   The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on chemical weapons:
   Chemical weapons, as President Bush told the United Nations ...,
are a scourge that threatens all mankind. And the threat is growing
rather than diminishing.
   Perhaps the most sobering statement Bush made in calling for an
international ban on these terrible weapons is that more than 20
nations now produce them, or have the ability to do so.
   For a worldwide treaty to be enforceable, it will require not
only the cooperation of major countries but also some kind of
mechanism to monitor and eliminate the use of chemical weapons by
thugs like Moammar Gadhafi.
   Bush's goal is highly noble, but one that will be extremely
difficult to achieve.

   The State, Columbia, S.C., on Hurricane Hugo:
   The destruction wrought by Hurricane Hugo was described by
Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. as ``unprecedented in anyone's
living memory.'' It will take time, hard work and hundreds of
millions of dollars before South Carolina, especially its coastal
areas, can recover from the huge storm, which landed a direct hit
on the historic port city and nearby barrier islands.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell, Mayor Riley, state health officials,
emergency preparedness personnel and thousands of National Guard
troops and law enforcement officers deserve major credit for
minimizing the human toll from the hurricane.
   Tragically, at least 17 lives were lost in South Carolina, but
that figure might have been much higher had it not been for the
excellent emergency planning that began long before Hugo made
landfall.
   Even with federal aid, the blow to this state's economy will be
heavy. Scores of historic buildings and homes were leveled in the
300-year-old city of Charleston, and its barrier islands were in
ruins. Many Grand Strand homes were swept away. Amusement parks
were wiped out. Bridges and roads were damaged or destroyed.
   At least for a while, the tourist trade, which brings in several
billion dollars annually, is likely to fall on hard times.
   Today, South Carolinians mourn those who did not make it through
the storm and give thanks for those who did. It was bad, very bad.
But it could have been worse.

   The Indianapolis Star on Hurricane Hugo:
   Assessing fully the ravages of Hurricane Hugo may take weeks,
and the total task of rebuilding may take years. ...
   Countless families lost homes, businesses, all of their
possessions and their livelihoods. Battering 20-foot waves and
140-mph winds devastated the Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island
and destroyed the only bridge connecting them to the (South
Carolina) mainland.
   Homes and other structures were smashed along a corridor of
destruction many miles wide and hundreds of miles long.
   The storm's worst-hit victims need help and need it badly. ...
   The need will continue until the emergency has ended, and it is
impossible at present to predict with any certainty when that will
be, either on the islands ravaged before the hurricane swept onto
the mainland or along the arc of destruction it left as it roared
northward.
   The mayor of Charleston, Joseph P. Riley, after touring his
city, said, ``We have on our hands a degree of physical destruction
that is unprecedented in anyone's living memory.''
   But he also promised, ``We will not just rebuild. We will
restore.''
   If so, the famous beauty that was Charleston will not be forever
gone with the wind.
   That is the spirit it will take to recover from a stunning
catastrophe.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on flag burning:
   President Bush was silly to propose, in response to a Supreme
Court decision in June, a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag
burning. And congressional Democrats are cowardly in pushing
legislation to accomplish the same end.
   It would be tragic indeed if the legacy of Gregory L. Johnson _
who triggered the case by burning the flag in a repulsive and
childish protest _ were to be the undermining of our Bill of Rights.
   There are strong indications the American people understand
that. After initial public outrage over the decision, common sense
has replaced passion.
   Upon calm reflection, the public has increasingly accepted the
notion that the glory of our freedoms, as symbolized by the flag,
is that it protects even those who would hold it in contempt.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on Barney Frank:
   When Ronald Reagan was president, U.S. Rep. Barney Frank was
among those who called for Attorney General Edwin Meese to resign.
Frank has been an advocate for high ethical standards during his
nine years in Congress.
   Now, influential voices are beginning to call for him to resign.
So far, he has refused to quit.
   The Massachusetts Democrat probably should step down _ if for no
other reason than his effectiveness has diminished.
   Frank ought to be judged on the propriety or impropriety of what
he did, not for being a homosexual. Frank acknowledged publicly in
1987 that he was gay.
   He is presently under fire for involvement with a male
prostitute who claims to have run a bisexual prostitution ring out
of the congressman's apartment in Washington, D.C.
   Frank does not deny that he had a relationship with Stephen
Gobie.
   In public life, Frank has condemned people such as Meese and
Illinois Rep. Gus Savage, who is accused of sexually harassing a
Peace Corps worker. Then, in private, Frank associates with people
like Gobie, who operate, at best, on the fringes of the law.
   (Frank's) sexual preference is not the issue. The issue is
character.

   The government and Colombia's most
notorious leftist guerrilla group have signed a peace accord, but
there will be no peace for the nation's cocaine cartels, President
Virgilio Barco said.
   Barco was to travel to the United States today to talk with
President Bush about Colombia's war against the drug traffickers.
   He announced the treaty late Tuesday night in a surprise
nationwide television and radio address, and said it calls for
pardons for members of the May 10 guerrilla movement and for them
to give up their weapons. The rebels also would be allowed to form
a political party under the agreement, reached after six months of
negotiations, Barco said.
   A deadline for the guerrillas to turn in their weapons will
presumably be set when the congress approves an amnesty. Colombia's
slow moving congress probably will not decide on that until at
least December.
   There was no immediate comment from M-19, one of six rebel
groups in Colombia. The Colombian congress must approve the accord.
   The guerrillas are urging the government to end its war against
the cocaine cartels, to pardon drug traffickers and to refuse to
extradite them to the United States.
   A statement by M-19 published in a full-page advertisement
Tuesday in El Tiempo, Colombia's largest newspaper, also urged
immediate negotiations between the government and drug barons.
   But bombings apparently by drug traffickers continued Tuesday,
and Barco said his government will press its 5-week-old crackdown
war on the cartels.
   One bomb exploded at a supermarket and seriously injured five
people and the other went off in the evening at a Catholic high
school. The school was closed, and there were no injuries there,
police said.
   Since the government crackdown began, there have been 112
bombings. Police say the bombs have killed eight people and wounded
137.
   Drug traffickers ``are trying to destroy the most precious thing
that Colombians have _ their democracy,'' Barco said in the speech.
   He said that since he declared war on the traffickers, security
forces have sezied 1,056 properties from the cocaine lords along
with 525 vehicles, 74 boats and 375 airplanes.
   More than 10,800 people have been arrested, and 535 of them have
been charged with crimes that link them to drug traffickers, Barco
said.
   The government claims that the drug lords and an estimated
10,000 guerrillas from six groups work together, with the cocaine
cartels providing money to the insurgents in exchange for armed
protection.
   M-19, believed to have about 2,000 members, is the only
guerrilla group negotiating with the government.
   M-19, or May 19, was formed in 1970 by dissidents who claimed a
presidential election that year was fraudulent.
   The group has waged a campaign of assassinations, kidnappings,
bombings and armed raids, but its actions in recent months have
been overshadowed by the battle between the government and drug
barons.
   In 1985, M-19 guerrillas seized the Palace of Justice in Bogota
and 95 people were killed during the army assault to recapture the
building.
   Barco said British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had approved
an aid package for Colombia to help fight drug traffickers and that
aid also was coming from West Germany, France and Argentina. He did
not give details.
   The United States has approved $65 million in aid, and much of
it already has arrived in Colombia.
   Barco said he will appeal for help from more countries in an
address Friday before the United Nations General Assembly.

   Concord (N.H.) Monitor on IRAs' tax advantage:
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's presidential aspirations could mean
tax breaks for millions of Americans.
   Bentsen's plan restores part of the IRA's tax advantage. It
would allow anyone to put up to $2,000 per year in an IRA while
paying taxes on half that amount. Taxes would have to be paid on
withdrawals from IRAs to pay for a first home or college expenses,
but no penalty for early withdrawal would be incurred.
   For financial reasons alone, Bentsen's expansion of IRAs is far
preferable to (President) Bush's cut in the capital gains tax.

   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on chemical weapons:
   President Bush received a ringing ovation by representatives of
the nations around the world when he called chemical weapons a
``scourge'' of the Earth.
   The proposal he unveiled before the United Nations General
Assembly to destroy more than 80 percent of the United States'
stockpile of those weapons if the Soviets reduce arsenals to an
equal level is praiseworthy. But it's not as sterling an ambition
as his wish to have international treaties ban the weapons entirely.
   The president's proposed ban makes sense.
   Militarily, the use of deadly chemicals is a repugnant
alternative. Unlike other weapons, lethal gases cannot be carefully
targeted. They know no boundaries, save the wind. ...
   Sooner or later, chemical weapons could find their way into the
hands of terrorists.
   The president said more than 20 nations have chemical weapons or
the capability to produce them.
   ``For the sake of mankind, we must halt and reverse this
threat,'' the president said.
   We couldn't agree more.

   Los Angeles Times on the Gorbachev revolution:
   The Soviet Union may be heading for a second October Revolution,
this one little more than a year from now when a Communist Party
Congress convenes ahead of schedule for the purpose of packing the
important Central Committee with people who are more in step with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reformist plans.
   Moving up the date of the next congress by some months was
approved at (last) week's Central Committee meeting. Also approved
was a shakeup in the party's ruling Politburo that should work to
further consolidate Gorbachev's power.
   Steadily and surely, the opponents of change, along with inept
and unpopular regional leaders, are being pensioned off in favor of
Gorbachev loyalists. The October, 1990 party congress is expected
to advance or even complete the consolidation process by providing
Gorbachev with the instrument he needs under party rules to fill
vacancies on the Central Committee with his supporters.
   For all the talk of powerful opposition to his (economic and
political) reform efforts and even widely reported rumors of plots
to oust him from office, Gorbachev thus seems to have emerged
stronger and more in charge than ever before. ...
   The downside could be that in reshaping the party and government
leadership in his own image, Gorbachev will lose what until now had
been a built-in excuse for not making more effective progress more
quickly.

   The Daily Journal, Vineland, N.J., on the Federal Election
Commission:
   It should come as no surprise that the Federal Election
Commission, set up in 1974 to enforce federal campaign laws,
apparently has not been doing its job.
   (A Common Cause study) said that the commission has sanctioned
campaign activities that run counter to central provisions of the
post-Watergate reform laws, including the state's campaign
contribution and expenditure limit.
   The six-member commission has on a number of occasions even
rejected the advice of its attorneys, who have argued for
enforcement of the law.
   The commission's real flaw is the people who sit on it. And
given the widespread inattention to ethics throughout government
these days, we're not sure how that one will be solved _ except by
throwing the blackguards out.

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on the Brontosaurus stamp:
   The Postal Service is in trouble with some people for putting
out a stamp with a picture of a dinosaur labeled ``Brontosaurus.''
Scientists say the correct name for what is popularly known as
brontosaurus is apatosaurus. ...
   (One expert in paleobiology at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural
History) said such willful disregard for the correct name of an
animal ``suggests that the Postal Service cares little for the
accuracy of the stamps (it issues and it prefers) `cartoon'
nomenclature to scientific nomenclature.'' ...
   Our office ... dictionary ... carries nothing under apatosaurus,
but under brontosaurus features a drawing of the beast and a
definition.
   If (scientists) want the world to get these names straight,
perhaps they should start with the dictionary publishers. ...
   The Postal Service's ``error'' will provide a benefit: ... The

   St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times on the convent near Auschwitz:
   Thanks to the Vatican's wise and principled intervention, Polish
Primate Jozef Glemp apparently will end his offensive attempt to
block the relocation of a Carmelite convent at the site of the
Auschwitz death camp in Poland.
   Perhaps Catholics and Jews in Poland and elsewhere can now go
about the more important business of attempting to resolve the
underlying strains that helped to create the wholly unnecessary
controversy over the convent's fate. ...
   While Auschwitz will remain a stark symbol of the deepest evils
of which human beings are capable, the new convent nearby may come
to be seen as evidence of our nobler instincts.

   The Capital Times, Madison, Wis., on sex on the college campus:
   One of the controversial AIDS ads ... shows a condom next to the
words ``He loves me'' and a blank space next to the words ``He
loves me not.''
   Apparently among middle-class college males in Canada _ and
likely among their American counterparts as well _ Option B, ``He
loves me not,'' seems to be in vogue.
   A survey of 6,911 white, middle-class college males in Canada
found that 80 percent of them were aware of the role condoms played
in curbing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Yet only 19
percent of the students who were sexually active said they used
condoms regularly. An amazing 26 percent said they never used them.
   These guys are dancing with death, not only for themselves, but
for their sexual partners as well. Of course the images of sex they
often see _ in movies, on television, in books and magazines _
seldom leave the fantasy world far enough to have lovers
incorporate condoms into their passion. But unprotected sex is not
fantasy. It is reality and it can have fatal consequences.

   The Herald-Dispatch, Huntington, W.Va., on a drug war proposal:
   The proposal by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky to allow law
enforcement agencies to shoot down planes suspected of carrying
illegal drugs is preposterous. Yet it passed the Senate last month
by a 55-45 vote as part of a defense-budget bill.
   Can you imagine the embarrassment as well as the anguish when
some innocent family, flying home in a Piper Cub from vacation, is
shot down and killed by overzealous federal agents?
   President Bush has declared war on drug trafficking and we
endorse every resonable means to stop this terrible blight on our
country. But we don't think the president meant open warfare, which
seems to be McConnell's goal. ...
   His fellow senator from Kentucky, Wendell Ford, tried to kill
the amendment last month. And now Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., says
he will use his influence on the Senate-House conference committee
to eliminate this part of the bill since the House version has no
such provision.
   We certainly hope Hopkins is successful.

   The Hutchinson (Kan.) News on controlling the sale of AK-47
assault rifles:
   Death by AK-47 isn't so far away, after all.
   The latest tragedy involving the assault rifle of choice these
days, the AK-47, was in a Kansas City suburb. ... A young man armed
with his AK-47 was shot dead by police after the man had terrorized
his neighborhood and refused repeatedly to put the weapon down.
   The National Rifle Association and the sycophants who fawn
whenever the gun lobby speaks will surely pronounce the same old
rationalizations for the death. ...
   Must the nation continue to be held captive by the gun
manufacturers, the NRA and politicians who grovel in front of both?
...
   Manufacture and sale of the assault weapons should be outlawed.
Period. And beyond that, all firearms sales should be subject to
national controls at least as stringent as those for getting a
driver's license.

   The Morning News Tribune, Tacoma, Wash., on smoking during
flights:
   The U.S. Senate and the American tobacco industry go back a long
way. Over the years, whenever Congress would try to pass a law
protecting non-smokers, an alliance of tobacco-financed senators
could always be counted on to kill or weaken it.
   That's why the Senate's recent action on in-flight smoking is so
encouraging. For once, the Senate has taken the hard line against
tobacco interests. Pushing aside Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
other members of the tobacco caucus, the full Senate ... approved
an amendment that would ban smoking on all airline flights in the
United States.
   Most air travelers _ 80 percent of whom don't smoke _ will
applaud the measure. Airlines currently maintain separate seating
sections for smokers, usually in the rear of the airplane. But the
air in a pressurized cabin is recirculated; partially filtered
smoke permeates the entire compartment. This may pose genuine
health risks for asthmatics and flight attendants. For other
passengers, it can be an obnoxious, annoying nuisance. ...
   If the Senate is going to start standing up to Helms and
company, the tobacco lobby will have a much tougher time buying
influence in high places. The industry has lost a lot of its old
influence in state capitals: No fewer than 44 states have enacted
laws restricting smoking in lobbies, stores, restaurants and other
public places. And most companies now restrict smoking in shared
work areas. It's a healthy trend.

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON AP) _ President Bush said today that he won't be
``deterred by rumors'' that Colombian drug lords have threatened to
kidnap one of his five children if the U.S. and Colombian
governments don't grant them amnesty.
   ``I can't do my job if I get deterred by rumors,'' Bush told
reporters in the Oval Office.
   However, the president confirmed that Secret Service protection
had been increased for his children.
   ``But that, to the degree security has been stepped up in
accordance with the law, on the Bush kids, it is not becausse of a
specific, hard piece of intelligence _ hard threat _ and I'm
confident of that,'' Bush said.
   New York Newsday quoted unidentified intelligence sources in
today's editions as saying that they believe Bush's 30-year-old
daughter, Dorothy LeBlond, is most vulnerable to an attack.
   The sources told the newspaper the kidnap threat also applied to
top U.S. officials involved in anti-drug efforts. The sources
declined to elaborate.
   The threats surfaced about two weeks after Bush's Sept. 5 speech
outlining his strategy against drug smuggling and abuse, the
sources said.
   In addition to LeBlond, a businesswoman in Portland, Maine, the
Bushes have four sons: George, John, Neil and Marvin.
   Bush, asked if he had any information on the Newsday report
said: ``I do not. And I have a feeling that that matter is of
enough interest to me that it would have been brought to my
attention.''
   Increased surveillance of the children had been reported
previously but word of a possible kidnapping was new, the newspaper
said.
   Richard Abrams, a Secret Service spokesman, would neither
confirm nor deny that protection for the Bush family was increased.
   ``Security is always tight, as you know,'' Abrams said.
   Initially the Bush children had resisted extra security but all
finally agreed to an increased Secret Service presence, the
newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   A Washington teen-ager is being held without
bond after being charged with selling undercover agents the crack
cocaine that President Bush used as a prop on national television.
   Keith Jackson, 18, is a student at the District of Columbia's
Spingarn High School, which was honored as ``drug free'' in a White
House ceremony in June. He was arrested Monday after being indicted
earlier in the day on five drug-related counts.
   One alleged sale took place Sept. 1 in Lafayette Park across the
street from the White House, where Jackson was allegedly lured by
agents at the direction of White House officials.
   Bush displayed the clear plastic bag of crack in a Sept. 5
speech to demonstrate the extent of the drug problem in the
nation's capital, although he did not say that the alleged dealer
had been drawn to the park by agents. Lafayette Park is not the
site of routine drug sales.
   Bush last week defended the direction White House image-makers
gave the DEA, saying, ``The man went out there and sold drugs in
front of the White House ... I can't feel sorry for this fellow.
   Jackson's court-appointed lawyer, Alan Warner, said the alleged
sale across from the White House ``definitely puts a twist on this
case that you normally don't get.'' He did not discuss what defense
he might use.
   U.S. Magistrate Patrick Attridge ordered Jackson, who has no
criminal record, held without bond.

   Customs agents arrested two
West Germans trying to smuggle in LSD soaked into stickers bearing
the image of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, authorities said
Wednesday.
   Agents at the Elten-Emmerich border crossing near Holland found
130 sheets of LSD-treated paper with Gorbachev's image stamped on
to look like decals, according to the regional customs office.
   Two West German workers with the Civilian Service, the
government's alternative to compulsory military service, were taken
into custody after a search of their car turned up the contraband
Monday.
   The Gorbachev stamps were similar to previous drug-smuggling
attempts in which pictures of Batman, Goofy and E.T. have been used
to disguise LSD doses.

   The Nation said seven people were rescued and 33 people drowned.
The Standard newspaper put the death toll at more than 20 and the

   The government said 11 rockets slammed

   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the rockets
hit near the government flour silos, where 50,000 tons of flour are
stored for winter. The silos are a frequent target of attacks by
U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   Amani said the casualties occurred at a house hit by a rocket
fired from the surrounding hills.
   Kabul has come under almost daily rocket attacks since late
June. More than 350 people have been killed and 800 injured.
   The government accuses the guerrillas of firing the rockets at
random to spread panic and force residents to flee to
rebel-controlled areas.
   The Pakistani-based guerrillas say the government fires at its
own civilians.
   Guerrillas have been fighting 11 years to oust the communist
government.

<HEAD>Government Cease-Fire Begins, but Radicals Kill Three</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sinhalese radicals shot and killed
three people Wednesday, the military said, the same day the
government began a cease-fire aimed at encouraging the radicals to
begin peace talks.
   The victims were a train driver, a government labor officer and
a bodyguard of a provincial council member.
   Soldiers halted military operations against Sinhalese militants
at 6 a.m. and said the cease-fire would last three days.
   Less than four hours later, Sinhalese militants shot and killed
a bodyguard of Jayasinghe Bandara, a member of the government's
Provincial Council, military officials said. The gunmen ambushed
Bandara's car in Baddula district, 80 miles east of Colombo, but
Bandara escaped unharmed.
   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the radicals also shot to death a train driver and a
government labor officer and torched 10 government buses in central
and southern Sri Lanka.
   However, about 50 Sinhalese radicals took advantage of the
cease-fire and surrendered at several military camps, the officials
said.
   The government hopes its cease-fire will encourage radicals of
the People's Liberation Front to put down their weapons and open
peace talks with the government.
   The front began its campaign to overthrow the
Sinhalese-dominated government in July 1987, after the president
signed an accord aimed at ending a war for independence by the
minority Tamils.
   Many Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population, said
the accord granted too many concessions to the Tamils, who account
for 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   A statement said the decision to call the cease-fire was made
during a meeting last week between President Ranasinghe Premadasa
and the five major opposition party leaders.
   ``If the armed militant groups respond favorably to this call,
... This period of three days would be extended,'' the statement
said.
   The cease-fire was one of 10 points in a plan proposed by the
opposition and intended to end the campaign of strikes,
assassinations and terror inspired by Sinhalese radicals.
   The government said troops will suspend all raids and search
operations but will help police maintain law and order.
   More than 200,000 leaflets in the Sinhalese language were
dropped from airplanes by government troops Tuesday over remote
villages. The leaflets offered rewards up to $510 to extremists who
surrender.

<HEAD>Key U.S. Ship in 1988 Battle Now Finds Gulf At Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD USS JACK WILLIAMS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The missile frigate that led the
fight in a major U.S.-Iranian battle has returned to the Persian
Gulf, but sailors find themselves patrolling sealanes becalmed by
more than a year of peace.
   ``It's much harder to convince people they need to stay
constantly alert when there's nothing going on,'' said Lt. Cmdr.
Wally Bloss, the ship's executive officer.
   Bloss described the current situation as ``boring'' for the 100
or so battle veterans aboard the Jack Williams, at least compared
with early 1988 when the gulf ``tanker war'' was at its peak and
U.S. warships protecting American-flagged vessels faced constant
threats by Iranian forces.
   There have been no reported incidents in the gulf since Iraq and
Iran agreed to a cease-fire Aug. 20, 1988, ending their 8-year-old
war. Foreign-flag ships no longer fear Iranian gunboat attacks, and
Tehran's own ships sail unmolested by Iraqi bombers.
   The United States, having cut its gulf-based force from 16 to 10
ships, scaled back further this month by deactivating the Hercules,
the last of two once-secret barges set up in 1987 as bases for Army
helicopters and Navy patrol boats to disrupt Iranian mine-laying
and raids on commercial shipping.
   Like other U.S. ships, the Jack Williams still maintains a
wartime condition called ``modified Zebra,''' in which watertight
doors and hatches can be sealed off in seconds. Six lookouts are
posted at all times, including a special ``mine watch'' on the bow
to spot drifting mines.
   Precautions also include going to ``general quarters,'' or
battle stations, when entering the ``Silkworm envelope,'' the
110-mile Strait of Hormuz within range of Iran's Chinese-made
anti-ship missiles.
   Since returning to the gulf in early August for a three-month
tour of duty, the ship based in Mayport, Fla., has had one close
call. A tail rotor failed on Aug. 27, sending a helicopter to the
water before pilots regained control.
   Such incidents, though hair-raising, pale next to April 18,
1988, when U.S. and Iranian forces engaged in a one-day battle,
later called the most important naval surface action involving U.S.
warships since World War II.
   Two Iranian oil rigs were destroyed and six vessels, including
two naval frigates, sunk or damaged in Operation Praying Mantis, a
US. reprisal for the near-sinking of the missile frigate USS Samuel
B. Roberts by an Iranian mine.
   Iran later acknowledged several dozen casualties. The United
States lost a helicopter gunship and its two-man crew to ``hostile
action'' hours after the fighting ended.
   Mementos such as the unit commander's flag and a Defense
Department battle citation are displayed in the crew's mess as
reminders of the Jack Williams' role, directing air and missile
strikes while dodging what were believed to be at least four of
Iran's Silkworm missiles.
   The Pentagon later insisted that Iran had not fired any
missiles. It said electronic analysis showed U.S. radar operators
had misinterpreted the blips of American missiles as hostile.
   There is little sympathy for that explanation among the ship's
battle veterans. Although preferring not to be quoted by name, some
say they remain convinced Silkworms were fired.
   Skeptics suggest the truth was concealed because U.S. officials
decided Iran had been punished enough and feared that fulfilling a
previous vow to retaliate for any Silkworm firings would inflame
the situation.
   ``I don't suppose the issue will ever be resolved to everyone's
satisfaction,'' a senior officer said.
   Being in the headlines had led the Jack Williams to expect a
hero's welcome at Mayport, but by the time it arrived home two
months later ``the public had pretty much forgotten'' about Praying
Mantis, Bloss said.
   ``Except for some local coverage, it was just like any other
homecoming,'' he said. ``We didn't mind. We were glad to be back.''

   ``The Cosby Show'' returned to the top of the
ratings for the first time since February and the Not Yet Ready for
Prime Time Players showed they're ready.
   Viewers proved they're ready for prime time too, as network TV
posted a 10-point audience increase from the previous week. The Big
Three's 72 percent share of the audience was the largest since
February, when CBS aired its acclaimed ``Lonesome Dove'' miniseries
and the competition responded with heavy-duty specials.
   Cosby pushed ABC's ``Roseanne'' to No. 2 in the Nielsen ratings
last week, and comic Jackie Mason's ``Chicken Soup,'' which had
placed No. 2 the previous week behind ``Roseanne,'' fell to 14th
place.
   NBC scored with its ``Saturday Night Live'' 15th anniversary
special. The Sunday night program's Not Yet Ready for Prime Time
Players finished No. 8.
   Overall, NBC continued first in the ratings for the 66th
consecutive week, with an average prime-time rating of 16.7. ABC
finished with a 13.1. CBS, which placed only one show in the top
10, had a 12.9, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Each rating point is the percentage of the nation's estimated
90.4 million homes with television sets.
   New shows featuring television veterans did not grab top spots
with viewers. NBC's ``The Nutt House,'' starring Cloris Leachman
and Harvey Korman and produced by Mel Brooks, checked in at No. 24.
   ``Island Son,'' marking the return of Richard Chamberlain to
series television was in 42nd place for CBS. ``A Peaceable
Kingdom,'' starring onetime bionic woman Lindsay Wagner, was in
65th place for CBS.
   The season premiere of NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' which featured
the return of Lisa Bonet's character, Denise, with a new husband
and child, had a 26.1 rating.
   ``Roseanne'' captured a 24.7 rating. ``Chicken Soup,'' which
follows ``Roseanne'' on ABC's Tuesday night lineup, got an 18.4,
losing 6.3 points from the previous week.
   A special Tuesday night preview of ``Doogie Howser, M.D.,''
producer Steve Bochco's latest entry for ABC, tied with CBS'
``Murder She Wrote'' for sixth place. The show about a teen-age
doctor got a 20.7 rating.
   Doogie didn't do as well in its regular Wednesday night slot,
where it finished in 33rd place with a 14.4 rating.
   Last week's top 10 shows were ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC;
``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``Golden Girls,'' NBC; ``Sister
Kate,'' NBC; ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS and ``Doogie Howser, M.D.''
ABC (tie); ``Saturday Night Live 15th Anniversary Show,'' NBC;
``Matlock,'' NBC; and ``Who's the Boss,'' ABC.
   In news, ``CBS Evening News'' finished with an 11.2 rating.
``ABC World News Tonight'' and ``NBC Nightly News'' each had a 10.2
rating. The ABC rating is based on four nights due to satellite
problems Wednesday. Nielsen has told ABC it will revise the numbers
at a later date.

   What's so wrong with America's
schools that the president, his Cabinet and the nation's governors
must retreat to this quiet college town to spend two days searching
for solutions?
   After all, the nation is pouring $353 billion into education.
That's $5,246 per pupil this year, 29 percent more in real,
inflation-adjusted dollars than in 1981, according to federal
estimates.
   But all that money and a decade-long clamor for school reform
seem to have hardly dented the national deficit in what students
know about the world around them.
   Bush, the governors and educators all have expressed hope the
summit on Wednesday and Thursday will be a first step in supplying
U.S. schools with something they've never had before: national
goals and standards.
   Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
met privately Wednesday here with Govs. Garrey Carruthers of New
Mexico and Booth Gardner of Washington, and said the governors
``had a sense of optimism that the meeting can come up with some
general goals'' to take home to their states.
   ``But the governors have some question about whether the meeting
can put together a plan to meet those goals. That's not going to
happen in two days,'' Geiger said, adding that with over 900
reporters crowded onto the University of Virginia campus, ``the
only sure thing is that this is a big media event.''
   Bush and others believe that in an increasingly competitive
world economic climate, it's high time the nation's schools agreed
on what students at different grade levels should know.
   A raft of recent reports suggest they don't know plenty:
   _Less than half the nation's fifth-graders know enough basic
science to realize it takes ``a few days'' to travel to the moon.
   _Two-thirds of high school students know so little economics
they can't define ``profits.''
   _Fewer than one in four high school juniors know when Abraham
Lincoln was president, or that Tennessee Williams wrote ``A
Streetcar Named Desire.''
   _In a comparison with pupils from 20 nations, U.S. students
ranked 10th in eighth-grade arithmetic, 12th in algebra, and 16th
in geometry.
   _Seventy-six percent of U.S. 17-year-olds are unable to write
adequate, imaginative prose.
   _Despite the much-ballyhooed classroom computer ``revolution,''
a majority of U.S. students remain computer illiterates _ unable,
for example, to correctly explain the role of a computer program.
   _Scores on college entrance exams, notably the Scholastic
Aptitude Test, have stagnated for the past five years, and the
performance gaps between whites and blacks, and between males and
females, are huge and growing.
   _Tests show that elementary schools are doing better at teaching
the basics _ such as reading and arithmetic _ but a federal
critique of U.S. grade schools also found that pupils leave with
the idea that science is a bore, history is a laundry list of
unconnected events and art and music are mainly about
finger-painting and kazoos.
   _Finally, some 23 million adults in the richest nation on earth
cannot read at acceptable levels.
   Since the 1983 federal report ``A Nation at Risk'' kicked off
the current reform movement with its conclusion that America's
schools had sunk into mediocrity, states and local districts have
tried strategy after strategy to turn schools around.
   States now require students, even 4- and 5-year-olds, to pass
competency tests. Twenty-seven states have enacted tougher teacher
training standards. Forty-six states have made teacher competency
testing mandatory. Average teacher salaries have risen by over
one-third since 1981 to about $29,000.
   Reformers first demanded that schools go back to basics. Then
they counseled that schools be restructured to give students more
individual attention and teachers more authority.
   The latest push, from Bush and others, is for parents to have
more choice over where their kids can attend school. The resulting
competition would make all schools better, according to that
belief, which is challenged by others.
   Student progress after a decade of such reform ferment has been,
at best, debatable.
   ``The plain truth,'' Bush said earlier this month, ``is that our
educational system is not making the grade. Spending more money on
education than most countries, we're getting less return on the
investment. It is time for change, perhaps radical change.''
   Most educators agree that the 1980s reform movement helped
students improve basic skills. But American youngsters remain
ill-equipped to compete in a complex, high-tech job market where
critical thinking skills are all-important.
   Hence, the summit.

   The Norwegian State Railroad's luck was on
the wrong track this week.
   The trouble started Monday when sparks from a bonfire lit by
railroad workers set fire to a wooden structure used to keep snow
off the tracks.
   Workers rolled out fire hoses only to find that a defective
coupling had cut water pressure. They fixed the coupling, but the
old hoses ruptured when the pressure increased.
   The blazing structure then collapsed onto the tracks, and the
heat warped the rails.
   The newspaper Bergens Tidene said about 1,000 passengers were
stranded for hours in the mountains outside Bergen and finally put
onto buses.
   ``We had certain technical problems,'' traffic manager Lars
Bjoerndal was quoted as saying.
   No one was injured in the mishaps.

<HEAD>New Romantic Drama by David Hare Will Premiere at Film Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: No PMs planned. ^By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British filmmaker-playwright David Hare thinks
American love stories aren't very realistic.
   And he considers his latest work, ``Strapless,'' a romantic
drama starring Blair Brown and Bridget Fonda, far more believable
than current Hollywood offerings. ``Strapless'' will have its
premiere at the New York Film Festival, which began Sept. 22.
   After a recent screening, the British director and he two
co-stars talked about romantic comedies.
   He attacked Rob Reiner's hit movie, ``When Harry Met Sally ..
.,'' for failing to integrate the lead characters into the outside
world.
   ``At no point was there any reference to the characters' jobs,
or to what their relationships were outside dating,'' said Hare.
``They were people who dated, that was their primary social
function. They either were happy or unhappy according to whether
they were dating.
   ``It's this way of looking at the world through people who exist
in rooms, and the minute the door closes, everything that is the
world is shut out of that room and you are simply together eating
lasagna or spaghetti or whatever kind of pasta the scene is about.''
   In ``Strapless,'' Brown stars as a 40-year-old American doctor
working in a London hospital and living with her rebellious younger
sister (Fonda). While on holiday, Brown is pursued by a romantic
``entrepreneur'' (Bruno Ganz), who follows her back to London and
eventually persuades her to marry him.
   But Ganz, substantially in debt, suddenly flees, and Brown is
forced to put her life back together again and provide support for
Fonda, who has become pregnant after a brief affair.
   Hare, who also wrote the screenplay, said he enjoyed the
challenge of creating female characters. ``There's nothing harder
to get than a member of the opposite sex. I know the benefit of
writing about women is you have such an extraordinary range of
underused actresses _ actresses able to do all sorts of things
they're not ususally given a chance to.''
   Hare also directed the 1984 drama ``Wetherby,'' and wrote the
play and screenplay ``Plenty.'' Meryl Streep starred in the film
version.
   ``Strapless'' currently has no distributor, but Hare said a deal
would be announced soon.

<HEAD>US Approves Visas for Two PLO Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department has approved visa
applications for two Palestine Liberation Organization officials to
attend the U.N. General Assembly session in New York, a U.S.
official said today.
   The officials said the visas were approved for Abd Rabbuh and
Suliman Najib, both PLO officials based in Tunis. The authorization
was relayed to the U.S. Embassy in Tunis Tuesday night, said
officials, speaking on condition they not to be identified.
   It was not clear whether PLO visa applications were received
only from those two officials.
   There had been speculation that PLO chairman Yasser Arafat might
request a visa and the State Department has refused to say whether
it would approve a request from him.
   On Tuesday, more than two-thirds of the Senate urged the Bush
administration to deny any visa request from Arafat to address the
General Assembly.
   The United States ended its efforts to isolate the PLO last
December after Arafat, at U.S. urging, said publicly he renounced
terrorism and accepted Israel's right to exist.

   Relief workers today began handing out
bottled water, clothing, plywood, roofing nails and disposable
diapers to the tens of thousands left homeless in hurricane-ravaged
South Carolina.
   ``I'm looking for anything I can get _ food, clothes,
everything,'' said Nicole Jeremiah, whose first-floor apartment was
flooded when a tree fell on the building. She and her four children
are living in a motel.
   ``This is quite devastating. I'm heartbroken. It'll take a while
to pick up all the pieces,'' she added. A baby carriage at her side
was filled with clothes and bread, pork and beans, soup and baby
food.
   Ms. Jeremiah was given the supplies at The Citadel Mall, one of
12 points set up by the city to distribute goods donated by
individuals and companies such as Wal-Mart and Safeway after Mayor
Joseph P. Riley Jr. set up a hotline Monday and pleaded for aid.
   ``The interest and concern and compassion and generosity of the
citizens of our country is extraordinary,'' he said.
   The goods were loaded on tractor-trailers from a warehouse and
taken to distribution centers today. Officials expected to empty 20
to 30 trucks a day across the city.
   About 300,000 residences or buildings remained without power
throughout South Carolina. An estimated 50,000 of Charleston's
65,000 residents were still out of their homes, Riley said.
   Today he urged federal officials to cut red tape to get aid to
the state. He said the state's problems included difficulty in
obtaining generators.
   As of today, the Red Cross had opened 32 relief centers in three
South Carolina counties to distribute food and clothing and provide
shelter, with more centers planned in other counties.
   ``We need money and we need people,'' said David Giroux, a
spokesman for the Red Cross. ``This is a Level 5 disaster _ they
don't get any bigger than this.''
   College football fans at six Southern universities are being
asked to bring canned goods to games Saturday to help storm victims.
   ``It is my hope that we can combine two of the South's finest
traditions _ college football and a desire to help our fellow
man,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
   In Cincinnati, the Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said it was sending 1.5
million disposable plastic diapers to South Carolina and Puerto
Rico through the Red Cross and the Salvation Army.
   Most of the national attention centered on this historic port
city, which took a direct hit from the storm Thursday, and
officials in outlying areas expressed concern that relief supplies
were not flowing to their communities.
   ``People are hungry. We are in desperate need of a whole lot of
help,'' said the Rev. Frank Maddox of Sumter.
   In North Carolina, preliminary damage estimates Tuesday stood at
$237 million for 23 counties, but state officials expected the
final total to be close to $500 million. In Charlotte, 155,000
customers were without power.
   Hugo smashed into South Carolina with 135 mph winds. At least 33
people were killed in the Caribbean; the mainland death toll rose
to 29 with a report today of a Kingstree, S.C., man who touched a
downed power line Monday night and was electrocuted.
   Residents of the barrier islands northeast of Charleston
continued to return to their homes by boat Tuesday, while the Army
Corps of Engineers began work on a temporary pontoon bridge to link
devastated Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Island to the mainland
again. The coastal resort of Garden City remained closed and
guarded by troops against looters.
   Power was extended to additional areas of the Charleston
historic district and traffic lights winked to life.
   However, schools remain closed indefinitely, a nighttime curfew
remained in effect and National Guardsmen continue to patrol the
streets.
   Charleston Harbor reopened to limited ship traffic Tuesday and
Navy ships, which rode out the storm off the coast, returned to
harbor.
   About 650 Department of Defense personnel were being sent to
assist in the relief effort, while the Mormon Church shipped water,
food, cooking stoves, power generators, propane fuel and tools.
   Ralston Purina Co. said it is sending three tons of dog food and
one ton of cat food from Atlanta to Charleston to replenish the
Humane Society's lost supply.
   President Bush on Tuesday expanded a disaster declaration to
five more South Carolina counties, bringing to 12 the number
eligible for federal money.
   Estimates of crop losses increased to $90 million, and were
expected to climb as more of the state's 5.3 million acres of
cropland is surveyed. Damage to South Carolina's forests was placed
at $1 billion, state officials said.
   The storm also has taken a toll on the $30 million a year
shrimping industry.
   Hugo struck in the middle of the May-to-November shrimping
season, wiping out shrimp beds and damaging related businesses.
   ``The biggest thing is people who buy the shrimp _ the packing
houses _ they're all wiped out. They're destroyed,'' said Jimmy
Scott, 45, a shrimper for the past 21 years. ``By the time they get
it built back, the season is over.''
   More trouble may be coming.
   High tides that come every 10 years when the moon reaches one of
its closest points to the Earth threaten more damage in mid-October
and mid-November.
   ``It's especially dangerous because an awful lot of habitable
structures are just barely sound. With a 7-foot tide, we could have
further beach erosion, further damage to structures,'' said Gered
Lennon, a geologist for the South Carolina Coastal Council.

   A former University of Florida student
has been indicted on murder charges in the shooting death of an
associate professor who had denied him a doctorate in pathology.
   Jens Peter Hansen also was indicted Tuesday on charges of
breaking into the home of Arthur Kimura and assaulting him in a

   Hansen, 41, was arrested several hours after the slaying and was
jailed without bail for trial Jan. 1.
   Kimura, also 41, was a member of an academic committee that
denied Hansen a doctorate three weeks before the slaying. Kimura
was the committee member who broke the news to Hansen and was
against giving him the degree.
   Prosecutor Len Register said no decision had been made whether
to seek the death penalty.
   Hansen had studied for the degree since 1984. His research was
not going well, univerity officials said.

<HEAD>Funds From Drug Seizures to Be Used to Build Prisons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh today
said $229 million seized from drug traffickers and organized crime
groups will be used to build more than 3,000 new federal prison
cells.
   The money, ordered transferred from the Justice Department's
Asset Forfeiture Fund to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, is a
downpayment on President Bush's proposed $1.5 billion in prison
construction, Thornburgh told an annual gathering of federal
prosecutors.
   ``This is one of the nicer ironies of our times,'' Thornburgh
said. ``We're now taking that money and turning it against those
criminals from whom it was so justly taken. Talk about poetic
justice _ this is that.''
   Since October 1988, agencies within the Justice Department
seized property valued at more than $1 billion. More than $500
million in forfeited and liquidated criminal property has been
deposited into the Asset Forfeiture Fund, Thornburgh said.
   About $150 million of that seized money has been shared with
local law enforcement agencies.
   ``It's, I think, satisfying to think that it's now possible for
a drug dealer to serve time in a forfeiture-financed prison after
being arrested by agents driving a forfeiture-provided automobile
while working in a forfeiture-funded sting operation,'' the
attorney general said to rousing applause from about 150 people.
   The Asset Forfeiture Fund has increased in yearly receipts from
$27.2 million in 1985 to more than $500 million so far this year,
according to Justice Department statistics.
   Thornburgh also said he will try to make the program more
efficient by creating an executive office for asset forfeiture in
the deputy attorney general's office to oversee the fund.
   The attorney general addressed the group under heavy security by
the FBI and U.S. marshals because of possible threats from
Colombian drug lords, authorities said.

<HEAD>About $4 Billion Needed to Rescue FHA Fund, Auditor Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress probably will need to come up with
about $4 billion over the next few years to rescue the fund that
has helped millions of Americans buy houses with FHA loans, the
government's chief auditor said today.
   Charles A. Bowsher, head of the General Accounting Office, told
a Senate panel the taxpayer money will be needed because the
Federal Housing Administration sustained a $4.2 billion loss in
1988 that plunged the FHA insurance fund $2.9 billion into the red.
That is the first time the agency has been in the hole.
   The outgoing Reagan administration previously reported losses of
more than $800 million in the FHA fund in 1988, less than
one-fourth the amount GAO auditors calculated.
   Bowsher said further losses must be anticipated in the next few
years as homeowners who have taken out government-backed loans
recently in economically depressed regions of the country find
themselves unable to keep up their payments.
   The current losses, the GAO chief said, stem from a combination
of hard economic times in what he called ``oil patch'' states and
mismanagement at the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
which administers the FHA.
   ``Basic management weaknesses must be corrected if future losses
are to be brought under control,'' Bowsher said in a report to the
Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs housing subcommittee.
   In testimony accompanying the report, Bowsher told the panel he
believes new HUD management is moving to correct past problems,
which he blamed partially on inadequate congressional oversight.
   ``I don't think we're in a free fall,'' Bowsher said. ``What we
have here is a program in trouble.''
   He said his audit staff had received full cooperation from HUD
Assistant Secretary C. Austin Fitts, who appeared with him at the
subcommittee hearing.
   ``We acknowledge that FHA has incurred substantial losses,'' she
said. ``The bad news is out on the table. We believe the problems
are manageable and fixable.''
   She asked in advance for congressional support for some reforms
she said HUD Secretary Jack Kemp will be outlining soon for housing
programs and introduced two top assistants from Wall Street she
said she has recruited to help shore up management of the agency's
FHA programs.
   ``We can't wring our hands about the past,'' said Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman.
   He complimented Ms. Fitts for her initial efforts and said, ``We
will pursue any legislative remedies that are necessary to make FHA
a strong and responsive institution that is able to serve the
housing needs of future generations in all parts of this country as
magnificently as it served the needs of the American people years
ago.''
   Bowsher outlined the basic problems with FHA for the same
subcommittee in August, but did not have specific loss figures in
that preliminary report.

   Ten people were poisoned accidentally at a

   ``The investigation is complete, with no intent of malice
found,'' Lt. Bud Brooks said Tuesday. ``It has been determined that
the cleaning solution which was ingested by the patrons had been
mistakenly placed in an area where the liquor was stored.''
   Six people remained hospitalized. The others were treated and
released.
   The victims all ordered a drink called a watermelon spot _ a
type of schnapps _ at The Peppermint Twist on Saturday night,
Brooks said. Instead of liquor, Brooks said, they were served some
type of dishwashing liquid from a container similar to the
container in which watermelon schnapps was kept.
   Brooks said detectives interviewed all employees who were
working the night of the incident and checked samples of the liquid.

<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court has agreed to
hear the appeal of a woman ordered to get married or move out of
her house, or lose custody of her child.
   The high court's unanimous agreement Tuesday to hear the
petition of Judith Annette Roush halts enforcement of orders issued
Aug. 23 by Kanawha County Judge John Hey. Arguments are scheduled
Nov. 7 before the Supreme Court.
   The case arose from a post-divorce claim for a change of custody
of Mrs. Roush's 14-year-old daughter.
   The appeal said Hey rejected the recommendation of a court
official known as a family law master that the child stay with her
mother solely because Mrs. Roush and her daughter live with a man
to whom Mrs. Roush is not married.
   ``The court therefore grants plaintiff 30 days from the date of
this hearing in which either to marry such man or move out and
establish separate living arrangements for her and her daughter,''
Hey said.
   Hey said if Roush does not comply, he will grant custody of
Melissa Ann Roush to her father, Rodney Roush. Hey also voided
Roush's child support obligation for the 30 days and until Mrs.
Roush meets one of the judge's stipulations, the appeal said.
   The couple divorced in January 1988 and Mrs. Roush was given
custody of the daughter. That September, Melissa moved in with her
father, who petitioned to modify the divorce decree.
   Mrs. Roush moved in with Robert Cain and his 13-year-old
daughter in St. Albans in January, and Melissa Roush followed in
April, the petition said.
   The lawsuit said Mrs. Roush believed the two girls living in the
same house would provide a stable environment for Melissa.
   Melissa wants to live with her mother, said the petition, which
added that Mrs. Roush takes home $80-$100 a week and cannot afford
to maintain an apartment of her own.

   Jean-Guy in November is matched against George McCabe, Donald

   Giannini was born in Rome and received a doctorate in physics
from the University of Rome in 1929. He studied there with Enrico
Fermi when Fermi was working with nuclear fission in hopes of using
it a source of radium for cancer treatment.
   In 1931 Giannini came to the United States and worked as an
acoustical engineer. He later founded his own aircraft and missile
guidance manufacturing company, Giannini Controls Corp.
   Giannini left the company in 1961 to pursue other interests.
   He held more than 50 U.S. patents.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor arrived at her
cop-slapping trial today in a black pantsuit and said she was
dressed for jail.
   Defense attorney William Graysen and Deputy District Attorney
Elden Fox were expected to give closing arguments today at the
3-week-old misdemeanor trial, which has cost taxpayers more than
$22,000.
   ``I don't know what's going to happen. I might go to jail, so
I'm dressed for it,'' the Hungarian-born actress told reporters.
   Miss Gabor could receive up to 18 months in jail if convicted of
misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's
orders, driving with an expired license and having an open
container of alcohol in her car.
   She is accused of slapping a motorcyle cop who had pulled over
her Rolls-Royce on June 14. She said she hit Officer Paul Kramer in
self-defense because he forcibly removed her from the car.
   On Tuesday, she twice stalked out of the courtroom and branded
her accusers as liars.
   ``I can't take this,'' she muttered as she walked out the first
time Tuesday when Officer Scott Thompson was called to the stand
for rebuttal testimony. She left again when a longhaired young man
said he admired Kramer.
   During testimony, 18-year-old Amir Eslaminia said he has had his
share of run-ins with Kramer. But he spoke glowingly of the officer
and described Miss Gabor's earlier testimony as false.
   ``I really thought it to be ... all made up,'' the pony-tailed
teen-ager said.
   During a break outside court, Miss Gabor explained her
departures.
   ``Both of them lied about me,'' she said. ``I tell you why I
left when the little punk with a hairdo like a girl and the earring
said she lies. ... Who needs that?''
   At that point Eslaminia shouted over the heads of reporters,
``Is that why you're causing this ruckus, so you can get more TV
for yourself?''
   Eslaminia was one of three prosecution character witnesses.
   Alice Joseph of Beverly Hills testified that Kramer was kind to
her and her 3-year-old daughter when they stopped to chat with him.
   Mateo Guerrero, ticketed by Kramer in 1985 for jaywalking, said
the officer was one of the nicest policemen he had ever met.
   ``I was humbled, but at the same time I felt good because he was
such a nice guy,'' he said.

   A mistrial was declared when a juror
realized she already had helped convict the defendant in an earlier
trial.
   ``I just had a funny feeling that I knew him from somewhere,''
Joyce Creekmore said Tuesday.
   ``After seven years, you have a tendency to kind of forget
somebody,'' she said. ``I think I recognized the look in his eyes
more than anything else.''
   James P. Johnson's trial opened Monday with two witnesses
testifying that residents of an apartment house tackled him June 23
after he tried to attack a resident.
   Johnson, 38, who acted as his own lawyer, is charged with
aggravated burglary and aggravated battery.
   His trial ended abruptly Tuesday when Ms. Creekmore told
officials that a jury she had been on in 1982 convicted Johnson of
attempted robbery.
   Court officials dug out the old records and learned that Ms.
Creekmore's memory was accurate. District Judge Paul Clark
rescheduled the case.
   Johnson was sentenced to nine to 30 years in prison after his
first trial but had been paroled.

<HEAD>`Good Likelihood' He and Gorbachev Can Sign Arms Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday there is ``a
good likelihood'' he and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
be able to sign a landmark treaty to slash the deadliest weapons in
the superpowers' nuclear arsenals in a summit meeting next year.
   Bush said that the scheduling of a summit in late spring or
early summer ``will serve as a catalyst for moving forward on a
treaty'' and that it may be ready by the summit.
   ``It's not absolutely certain that that's going to happen but I
would have to agree (there is) a good likelihood that might
happen,'' Bush said in an interview with a small group of reporters
in the Oval Office.
   Bush's statement put him in sync with an optimistic forecast by
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who told the United
Nations on Tuesday there are ``realistic prospects'' by the time of
the summit for passing ``the last turn'' on the road to a strategic
arms reduction treaty (START) to trim 30 to 50 percent from the
each nation's arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and
submarines.
   ``I don't want to set it up so that if we don't have every `t'
crossed and `i' dotted (on a treaty) that the summit ... is
considered a failure,'' Bush said. But he said he agreed with
Shevardnadze's statement.
   Bush held the news conference after delivering a speech before
the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund and before flying to Charlottesville, Va., for a meeting with
the nation's governors to improve the country's education system.
   He said he was looking forward to a ``candid and very
free-flowing discussion'' at the two-day meeting at the University
of Virginia. Bush predicted the sessions would result in ``strong
consensus'' for national educational goals, as well as in greater
flexibility in the way states can use federal education aid.
   Moreover, Bush said, ``There's a strong recognition among the
governors that we need accountability for achieving results
relating to the goals.''
   On another subject, Bush confirmed that security has been
tightened around his four sons and one daughter _ all of them
adults _ but said it was not in response to any ``hard threat''
from Colombian drug lords.
   Asked about a published report that drug barons had threatened
to kidnap one of his children unless granted amnesty, Bush said,
``I have not heard that and I feel confident I would have if
there'd been what I call `hard' intelligence.''
   Expressing confidence in the Secret Service's ability to protect
his family, Bush said, ``I don't live in fear of anything like that
... I can't do my job if I get deterred by rumors.''
   On other subjects:
   _Bush balked at a Soviet proposal to go beyond the plan he
outlined earlier this week to the U.N. General Assembly for deep
cuts in the superpowers' chemical weapon stockpiles. Asked if he
would accept the Kremlin's offer to eliminate all poison gas from
U.S. and Soviet arsenals, Bush said, ``No. Absolutely not. We need
a certain sense of deterrence.''
   _The president said ``I would have difficulty'' eliminating all
testing of nuclear weapons. Bush said he was willing to discuss
Soviet proposals to ban testing, but added, ``we do have some
differences on it'' with Gorbachev.
   _Bush avoided making a commitment for additional U.S. aid for
Poland beyond the $219 million in economic and food aid already
promised. Saying he wanted to see what kinds of reforms Poland
adopts, Bush said, ``Let's move apace, let's see what it is that is
required in terms of reform and then we'll try to do everything we
can.''
   The path toward a START treaty became brighter last week when
the Soviets, in two major concessions, said they would not let
their objections to the U.S. Star Wars missile defense program and
to submarine-launched cruise missiles stand in the way of a nuclear
arms pact.
   ``The spirit that prevailed in Wyoming is just one more
manifestation that we don't have a `disconnect' with Mr. Gorbachev
on Soviet-U.S. relations,'' Bush said. ``And that spirit will
obviously make it much easier to discuss contentious regional
issues or arms control issues.''
   At the same time, Bush said the United States must still regard
the Soviets as an adversary from a military standpoint.
   ``I want to have a prudent defense policy,'' Bush said. ``I
don't want to do something naive or silly in defense just because
we are working more closely with the Soviets today.''
   The president echoed warnings by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
that the United States must not drop its guard in anticipation of a
less militant policy by Moscow.
   Bush told the reporters:
   ``Cheney's voice is loud and clear. And he's saying, `Don't do
something dumb. Don't make the mistake of unilaterally disarming,
knocking out strategic modernization programs at the very minute
that the Soviet Union is going forward on the modernization front.'
   ``And that's good advice for the president of the United States
and, believe me, it is needed and good advice for the Congress of
the United States.''
   Bush noted that he has been criticized by Democrats for being
too timid in dealing with arms proposals from the Kremlin. ``I
think the team that I have knows what it's doing,'' he said.

   Sony Corp. said today it has agreed to acquire
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., the huge movie and TV
production company, in a cash deal valued at $3.4 billion.
   Sony's U.S. subsidiary, Sony USA Inc., said a tender offer of
$27 a share had been approved by Columbia's board of directors
subject to certain conditions, but that it expected to complete the
acquisition by early November.
   Coca-Cola Co., Columbia's largest shareholder at 49 percent,
said it had signed an option agreement to tender its stake, subject
to ratification by the Coca-Cola board, which was expected at a
meeting next Monday.
   The deal had been widely rumored since Monday, when Columbia
disclosed it was in buyout talks with a third party that it refused
to identify.
   The buyout of Columbia, which began as a tiny studio in 1920 and
grew into a major Hollywood force, is the latest chapter in a wave
of consolidation that has swept through the entertainment industry.
   Columbia's Chairman, Donald R. Keough, said Sony was ``an ideal
buyer.''
   ``It has all the right characteristics and very importantly has
the ability to take the company to its next important step,'' he
said.
   Michael Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America, said
the purchase of a major film studio ``extends Sony's long-term
strategy of building a total entertainment business around the
synergy of audio and video hardware and software.''
   He said the electronics giant will place day-to-day operation
operation of Columbia in U.S. hands and ``keep it as independent as
possible as a full-fledged member of the U.S. film industry.''
   Columbia said Victor Kaufman, its president and chief executive,
and Lew Korman, chief operating officer, will resign once the deal
is completed.
   There were published reports today that Peter Guber was expected
to replace Kaufman. Guber, who co-produced ``Batman,'' ``Rainman''
and ``Flashdance,'' is considered one of Hollywood's top producers.
   Columbia owns two major film studios, Columbia Pictures and
Tri-Star Pictures, but its box-office results have been
disappointing in recent years. Among its recent releases are
``Ghostbusters II,'' ``The Karate Kid Part III'' and ``Casualties
of War.''
   It has been a more impressive force on television, where it has
produced or distributed 11 prime-time series, including five new
shows. Among its productions are ``Who's the Boss'' and ``Designing
Women.''
   Columbia also about 820 movie screens in 220 locations and a
library of more than 2,700 films and 23,000 TV episodes.
   In other media deals, MGM-UA accepted a $1.5 billion buyout
offer earlier this month from the Qintex Group of Australia.
   Time Warner Inc. is on the verge of completing its acquisition
of Warner Communications Inc., which owns the Warner Bros. movie
studio and the TV production company Lorimar.
   The giant media company News Corp. bought 20th Century Fox three
years ago.

   President Bush headed for a two-day
education summit with the nation's governors today predicting a
``strong consensus'' for overhauling public schools and improving
classroom performance, but he rejected any major new federal
spending.
   Meeting with reporters before leaving the White House, the
president said he was looking forward to ``a candid and very
free-flowing discussion'' with the governors and anticipated ``much
agreement ... for greater flexibility in the use of federal funds''
for the schools.
   ``I'm hopeful we're going to come out of the summit with a
commitment to restructure and to make those fundamental changes
that are needed if we are going to improve educational
performance,'' Bush said.
   But the president balked at suggestions by several governors for
expansion of the Head Start program for needy preschool children
and other federal school programs. Bush said ``we're not going to
quintuple spending'' while struggling to reduce the budget deficit.
   ``Our problem is not money, our problem is using the money that
is there effectively,'' White House chief of staff John Sununu said
on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   After a helicopter flight from Washington, Bush planned to join
the governors in a series of closed-door discussions on
revitalizing the teaching profession, improving the learning
environment _ including keeping drugs out of schools _ and deciding
who's in charge of the schools.
   Even as the governors gathered on the University of Virginia
campus under clear, sunny skies, there was grumbling about White
House limitations on the role _ and visibility _ of the governors
at the summit.
   With more than 900 reporters covering the talks, ``the only sure
thing is that this is a big media event,'' said Keith Geiger,
president of the National Education Association. And according to
at least one governor, that's the way the White House wanted it.
   Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas told his fellow
governors in a memorandum Monday that White House officials were
keeping them on a short leash at the summit.
   He complained that the White House refused to make any of the
working sessions public, barred staff members from meetings between
governors and Cabinet members and allow only administration
officials to prepare a summary of the discussions.
   Roger Porter, a domestic policy aide to Bush and the chief
summit planner, was reported to have replied that the governors had
approved of the original summit scenario. But Clinton press
secretary Mike Gauldin said Porter agreed to Clinton's request for
the governors to bring note-taking aides to the meetings.
   Geiger said Govs. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico and Booth
Gardner of Washington told him they were optimistic that the summit
could produce some general goals, but questioned whether a plan
could be developed for meeting those goals. ``That's not going to
happen in two days,'' Geiger said.
   The president was expected to resist any demands for hefty
increases in federal spending on education, which currently
accounts for $46.7 billion of the $353 billion spent at the
federal, state and local levels.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, a former college president,
led Bush's entire Cabinet with the exception of Secretary of State
James Baker III to the summit. Most of the governors were bringing
along their top school superintendents or education advisers.
   Bush said Tuesday in Washington that he wanted to ``listen and
work with the governors, not try to impose an agenda from here.''
His aim, he said, was ``to see us come up with some suggestions
that will dramatically change things.''
   Not since 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt called together the
governors in the midst of the Great Depression, have the states'
chief executives and the president joined forces to examine one
pressing issue.
   By merely inviting the governors to the summit, Bush has drawn
unprecedented attention to the failings of the nation's schools and
dismal academic achievements of students.
   ``I think we will establish the fact that we need measurable
national goals,'' Bush said today. ``And this, I am told, most of
the governors agree on.''
   The governors headed for the summit with plenty of their own
ideas.
   Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana said he wants national
goals to boost pupil achievement scores, reduce teen-age
pregnancies and lower the school dropout rate, and assurances that
each state will have flexibility to meet its school needs free of
federal intervention.
   Although some governors insisted that more federal money is
essential, Bayh asserted that ``just throwing money at the problem
is not all there is to something as complex as education.''
   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris, a Democrat, said, ``What is
needed most critically from the president and the federal
government in the area of education is leadership.''
   After a state dinner tonight in a tent outside Monticello,
Jefferson's home near the university, Bush and the governors are to
reassemble Thursday morning for more working sessions, a luncheon
convocation and a finale at which Republican and Democratic
governors will join Bush in delivering closing statements.

<HEAD>Former Pierce Top Aide Refuses to Answer `Substantive' Questions</HEAD>

<HEAD>Eds: New lead to say Wilson refused to answer substantive questions;

   A former top assistant to onetime Housing
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. cited his Fifth Amendment rights
today in refusing to answer ``substantive'' questions by a
congressional panel about the scandals at HUD.
   Lance Wilson, once Pierce's executive assistant, appeared under
subpoena but refused to answer most questions.
   That means Pierce and his two closest aides at HUD _ Wilson and
his successor as executive assistant, Deborah Gore Dean _ have all
refused to respond to questions by the House subcommittee probing
allegations of influence-peddling, fraud and mismanagement at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Wilson read a brief statement saying ``statements made by the
subcommittee members ... convinced me the subcommittee had already
prejudged me'' and identified him as ``a prime candidate for a
criminal investigation.''
   Committee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., then posed a series of
four questions to Wilson, who refused to answer each one.
   Although Wilson said he would answer no ``substantive''
questions, he later responded to two questions put to him by Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
   Shays asked if the HUD inspector general, who earlier this year
released a report finding widespread problems in the department's
moderate rehabilitation housing subsidy program, had sought to talk
to him about that program, and if Wilson had done so.
   Wilson responded that he had been asked to meet with the
inspector general, but did not do so. Asked to explain why he did
not meet with the inspector general, Wilson refused to answer.
   Outside the courtroom, Wilson's attorney Raymond Banoun charged
that members of the subcommittee were trying to ``grandstand'' and
had spent much of the meeting ``ridiculing someone for exercising
his rights.''
   ``They don't want to know the truth,'' Banoun said.
   As Pierce had done a day earlier, Wilson used a House rule to
bar television, radio and photographic coverage of his appearance.
   The panel also planned today to question Donald Maron, chief
executive officer of Paine Webber, about the company's dealings
with HUD. Wilson went to work for Paine Webber after leaving HUD
and helped the company obtain HUD business.
   Pierce, in a dramatic session Tuesday, appeared under order of
subpoena before the House Government Operations subcommittee on
employment and housing.
   Lantos and other committee members responded today to Pierce's
charge that he had been ``prejudged'' by the panel.
   Lantos said the panel has not prejudged Pierce's potential
criminal culpability but had reached a judgment about his tenure as
secretary of HUD for eight years.
   ``He was a miserable secretary of HUD,'' Lantos said. ``... The
record of HUD is clear. It's there for all to see.''
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., called for a grand jury
investigation of the top-level HUD activities during Pierce's
administration. He said the Justice Department should ``view this
not just as a case of mismanagement and mistaken judgment at the
highest levels of HUD, but an instance in which white-collar crime
may well have occurred.''
   Despite congressional protests that he was throwing up
roadblocks in their investigation, Pierce read a brief statement
saying he had not had time to prepare, did not have the HUD
documents he needed and would invoke his constitutional right not
to testify.
   ``The subcommittee's desire to rush me through this process,
together with various statements made by members ... leads me to
the painful conclusion that I hae been prejudged by this body,''
Pierce said.
   ``Under these circumstances, my counsel has advised me and I
have agreed to assert my constitutional rights under the Fifth and
Sixth Amendments by refusing to answer questions before this
subcommittee,'' he said. ``I trust this subcommittee will remember
that these rights are intended as shields for the innocent and that
they do not create any inference or presumption of wrongdoing.''
   Paul L. Perito, his attorney, said Pierce might be ready to
testify on Oct. 27, the next date he has been ordered before the
panel. But outside the committee room, Perito told reporters the
subcommittee wouldn't give Pierce a fair hearing.
   ``They want to try, convict and sentence him, and we will not
let that occur,'' Perito said. ``This man is an innocent man.''
   Wilson's appearance under subpoena follows his refusal to appear
Aug. 18 before the panel and his refusal to comply with its
subpoena demanding records of his dealings with HUD after leaving
government.
   After leaving the agency, Wilson invested in several projects
that received lucrative subsidies from HUD and helped his employer,
Paine Webber, obtain business with HUD.
   Banoun said a report by Paine Webber attorneys who questioned
Wilson concluded ``there was nothing improper in his conduct or in
matters related between Paine Webber and HUD.''
   Dean, Wilson's successor as Pierce's executive assistant,
appeared before Congress in May but refused to answer questions,
asserting her Fifth Amendment rights as well.

   President Bush said today there is ``a good
likelihood'' the United States and Soviet Union will be ready to
sign a treaty slashing strategic nuclear arsenals by the time of a
superpower summit in late spring or early summer.
   He said the scheduling of the summit with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev ``will serve as a catalyst for moving forward''
on a treaty but that ``it's not a given'' that an agreement will be
ready.
   ``It's not absolutely certain that that's going to happen but I
would have to agree (there is) a good likelihood that might
happen,'' Bush said in an interview with a small group of reporters
in the Oval Office.
   In response to other questions, Bush refused to commit himself
to an expansion of the Head Start program for poor preschool
children, said a vote in Congress against his proposed cut in the
capital gains tax ``will be a vote for a tax increase'' and said
any additional U.S. aid to the non-communist government in Poland
would depend on economic reform in that Eastern Bloc nation.
   Long-range weapons talks in Geneva have been deadlocked, but
within the past week the Soviets removed two major obstacles to a
Stratetgic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), which would cut by 30
percent to 50 percent the warheads carried on long-range bombers
and missiles.
   In the biggest development, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze told Secretary of State James A. Baker III that Moscow
would not let its objections to the U.S. Star Wars program block
completion of a treaty, but would insist on compliance to a 1972
treaty that bans space-based defenses.
   Shevardnadze also told Baker the Soviets would agree to a
separate deal on limiting submarine-launched cruise missiles, which
they had wanted to include in the START talks.
   Bush hailed the improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations,
particularly the array of agreements reached by Shevardnadze and
Baker.
   Shevardnadze told the United Nations on Tuesday there were
``realistic prospects'' that a strategic arms treaty can be ready
by the summit.
   ``The spirit that prevailed in Wyoming is just one more
manifestation that we don't have a `disconnect' with Mr. Gorbachev
on Soviet-U.S. relations,'' Bush said. ``And that spirit will
obviously make it much easier to discuss contentious regional
issues or arms control issues.''
   At the same time, Bush cautioned that the United States still
has to regard the Soviets as an adversary from a military
standpoint.
   ``I want to have a prudent defense policy,'' Bush said. ``I
don't want to do something naive or silly in defense just because
we are working more closely with the Soviets today.''
   Bush noted that he has been criticized by Democrats for being
too timid in dealing with arms proposals from the Kremlin. ``I
think the team that I have knows what it's doing,'' he said.
   Asked about a report that Colombian drug lords had threatened to
kidnap one of his five children unless granted amnesty, Bush said,
``I have not heard that and I feel confident I would have if
there'd been what I call `hard' intelligence.''
   He confirmed that security had been increased around his four
sons and one daughter but said it was not in response to what he
called ``a hard threat.''
   Expressing confidence in the Secret Service's ability to protect
his family, Bush said, ``I don't live in fear of anything like that
... I can't do my job if I get deterred by rumors.''
   On other subjects, Bush:
   _Declined to support an expansion in the Head Start program for
poor preschool children. Bush, who opens an education summit today
in Charlottesville, Va., with the nation's governors, said the
country is struggling with a huge budget deficit and ``we're not
going to quintuple spending.''
   _Refused to commit himself to increasing funds for Poland beyond
the $219 million package of food and economic assistance. ``The key
thing is the Poles themselves,'' Bush said, adding that any further
steps taken by the United States would hinge on an economic reform
package being drafted by the Polish government. Earlier, in a
speech to the International Monetary Fund, he said, ``we must do
more'' to help the new, non-communist government.
   _Defended anew his proposal for a cut in the capital gains tax
on profits from sales of real estate, stocks and other assets _ a
plan that congressional Democrats are bitterly contesting.
   ``The issue has been distorted by those who try to maintain that
it's a tax for the rich. They are wrong about that,'' he said.
   Bush said a vote against the capital gains tax cut in the House
on Thursday ``will be a vote for a tax increase.''
   Bush balked at a Soviet proposal to go beyond the plan he
outlined earlier this week at the United Nations for deep cuts in
superpower chemical weapon stockpiles.
   Asked if he would accept the Kremlin's offer to eliminate all
poison gas from U.S. and Soviet arsenals, Bush said, ``No.
Absolutely not. We need a certain sense of deterrence.''
   Bush has proposed an 80 percent cutback in the U.S. arsenal if
the Soviet Union will cut back an equal amount. The president also
is pushing for an international treaty to eliminate chemical
weapons.

   President Zine Abidine Ben Ali on
Wednesday fired his prime minister, who had expressed growing
opposition to Ben Ali's reform moves.
   The president named Justice Minister Hamed Karoui to replace the
ousted prime minister, Hedi Baccouche, the government announced.
   ``A new post will be found for Baccouche,'' said a statement
from the president's office without elaboration.
   Baccouche, a personal friend of the president, was named to lead
the government immediately after the palace coup Nov. 7, 1987, in
which Ben Ali ousted President Habib Bourguiba.
   The two men had grown progressively further apart recently as
Ben Ali sought to put through his own program of political and
economic reforms.
   Before taking over the Justice Ministry, the 62-year-old Karoudi
had been minister of youth and sports and director of the ruling
Constitutional Democratic Rally party.
   The new prime minister was received by Ben Ali on Wednesday
afternoon and later told newsmen the president had instructed him
to intensify ``the process of democratization and the carrying out
of the government's economic prerogatives.''

   Mount Etna lit up the sky early Wednesday
with fire and fountains of lava spraying from the southeast crater
of Europe's most active volcano.
   The volcano also spewed ash that blew six miles west toward the
small towns of Milo, Fornazzo and Giarre, said Dr. Gianni Fazzetta

<TEXT>
   A thrift and two former executives have been
indicted on charges of faking defaults on $35 million worth of
federally guaranteed student loans to get reimbursed by the
government, prosecutors said today.
   The U.S. Department of Education paid Florida Federal Savings
Bank about half the money before the thrift was cut off, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory Kehoe.
   ``The students never had an opportunity to repay the loans,'' he
said. ``There's no evidence the claims or proper documents were
ever sent to them.''
   The indictment alleges false claims for 17,000 students totaling
$35 million were submitted to the Education Department in 1986 and
1987.
   Indicted with the St. Petersburg thrift on conspiracy, theft and
fraud charges were former assistant vice presidents Robert O.
Harmas, 42, of Noblesville, and James J. LaMantia, 59, of Largo.
   They were arranging their surrender today.
   The federal student loan program makes low-interest college
loans. Banks and thrifts lend their own funds, and the government
or a guarantee agency insures them against default by students.
   At the time of the allegedly faked defaults, Florida Federal,
formerly Florida Federal Savings and Loan Association, was the
second-largest thrift in the Southeast and the third-largest
provider of guaranteed student loans in the country.

   Gen. Michel Aoun told Christian lawmakers
to oppose political reforms contained in an Arab League peace plan
until Syria agrees to withdraw its forces from Lebanon, sources
said Wednesday.
   Both Moslem and Christian lawmakers are to meet in Saudi Arabia
on Saturday to discuss political reforms called for in the peace
plan. Since March, Syrian forces have been aiding Moslem factions
fighting Aoun's Christian troops.
   A Christian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Aoun had ``passed the message to several parliamentary deputies''
to oppose the political reforms, which call for Moslems to have a
greater say in governing this divided nation.
   The pro-Syrian Ash-Sharq daily accused Aoun of ``obstructing the
peace process by bringing pressure to bear on legislators not to
attend the meeting in Saudi Arabia.''
   A Sunni Moslem parliamentarian, speaking on condition of
anonymity, alleged Aoun wanted to ``do his best to prevent a
parliamentary quorum in Saudi Arabia because he fears that
legislators might elect a president there.''
   Two-thirds of the 73 parliamentarians constitutes a quorum,
which is needed to elect a president.
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since Sept. 22, 1988,
when President Amin Gemayel's six-year term expired with Parliament
unable to elect a successor. That political crisis triggered the
latest spasm of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   In Damascus, Syrian Vice President Khaddam held talks with
Moslem legislators and a pro-Syrian Christian deputy, Michel Daher,
who was Syria's candidate to succeed Gemayel last year.
   Syrian officials referred to Daher as the ``Lebanese
presidential candidate.'' That indicated they may present him again
if the legislators make headway in Saudi Arabia.
   The proposed reforms call for Lebanon's Maronite Catholics, the
dominant Christian sect, to surrender the privileges they have held
since independence from France in 1943 and share power equally with
Moslems.
   In 1943, the Christians were considered the majority. But
Moslems now comprise an estimated 55 percent of the country's 4
million people.
   Aoun, a Maronite, fought the Syrians for six months of savage
artillery battles in a bid to force them to pull out of Lebanon,
where they have had a military presence since 1976.
   He claims the Syrians, who support the Moslems, are an
occupation army.
   The Syrians, long the main power brokers in Lebanon, consider
the country vital to their strategic defense against Israel, which
occupies a border strip in south Lebanon.
   Aoun reluctantly accepted the Arab League plan even though it
made no specific mention of a Syrian withdrawal.
   A cease-fire called by the Arab League Saturday generally was
holding Wednesday, despite sporadic sniper clashes on Beirut's
dividing Green Line and the other fronts in the north and the
eastern mountains.
   Three Christian legislators crossed Beirut's dividing Green Line
in a rare foray into Moslem west Beirut and held a lengthy meeting
with Shiite Moslem Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini at his home.
   The Arab League plan calls for increasing the number of seats in
Lebanon's one-chamber parliament to 128, to be divided equally
between Moslems and Christians.
   It also proposed stripping the president of the authority to
appoint and dismiss prime ministers, who would be elected instead
by parliament.

   The head of Pennsylvania's student loan
agency was acquitted today of taking kickbacks from a company
awarded a contract to collect delinquent loans. His chief aide was
found guilty on eight charges.
   Kenneth R. Reeher, executive director of the Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency, was cleared on all counts. Harry P.
Casoni, his former aide, was found guilty of charges including
conspiracy, bribery and mail fraud.
   Acting U.S. Attorney James West said Casoni faces up to 40 years
in jail and $2 million in fines.
   Reeher, 67, had been on a leave of absence without pay. He said
he has no intention of retiring. ``We're very, very elated,''
Reeher said. ``We always had faith it would work out. ... It's been
two difficult years.''
   Casoni's attorney, Arthur Goldberg, said Casoni will appeal.
   The jury began deliberating Monday.
   In 1986, Reeher awarded a $1.76 million contract to Gabler
Educational Management Services of Libertyville, Ill., to collect
defaulted loans.
   In return, prosecutors said, he demanded 50 percent ownership of
the company for himself and Casoni and half the fees PHEAA paid to
Gabler, and negotiated a $130,000-a-year job for Casoni.
   Casoni resigned from PHEAA and took the job, giving Reeher money
from his paychecks along with air conditioners and a van,
prosecutors said.

<HEAD>200,000 Soviets Likely to Be Turned Away from Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After decades of pressing for freer emigration,
American officials said Tuesday that a boom in would-be immigrants
likely will force the United States to turn away more than 200,000
Soviets in the next year.
   Many never would have tried to leave the country before the
Soviet Union liberalized its emigration procedures. Some Jews and
other groups that long have been an American priority are worrying
they will be forgotten.
   Refuseniks believe new U.S. procedures going into effect Oct. 1
are sure to limit Jewish emigration to the United States at a time
when they say anti-Semitism is on the rise in the Soviet Union.
   ``The situation here is getting worse,'' Elena Rappoport, a
leader of the Jewish refusenik group Poor Relatives, said in an
interview.
   U.S. Embassy officials, following ceilings set in Washington,
said they will accept 50,000 Soviet refugees next year and permit
an additional 20,000 to 30,000 to enter the country on a parole
system. Parolees are not given the same federal assistance as other
refugees.
   That's more than the roughly 50,000 the United States will admit
this year, but only a fraction of the 300,000 applications embassy
officials said they expect to receive next year. The U.S. embassy
says it is receiving about 10,000 applications a month, or about
90,000 so far this year.
   ``There is a limit to the number of Soviet emigrants, and to the
number of emigrants the United States can take,'' a U.S. Embassy
official said.
   The United States is appealing to other Western countries to
help, said the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Nowhere is it written that the United States should be the
only destination of Soviets who want to emigrate,'' he said.
   Under the new regulations, would-be refugees must fill out a
questionnaire that will be sent directly to Washington for
consideration.
   Based on a review giving priority to those with relatives in the
United States or members of groups considered to be persecuted in
the Soviet Union, such as Jewish refuseniks and Pentacostalists,
officials in Washington will send notices to those who qualify for
interviews at the Moscow embassy.
   U.S. officials acknowledged that the system depends on the
notoriously slow and unreliable Soviet mail. They say applicants
who hear nothing after several months will have to assume they are
being rejected. And they said it is possible that people who face
persecution in the Soviet Union and therefore qualify for refugee
status may fall through the cracks.
   Three-quarters of the spaces are likely to go to people with
parents, children, brothers, sisters or spouses already in the
United States, embassy officials say.
   Jews will no longer be able to leave the country on an Israeli
visa and then apply for admission to the United States in Vienna or
Rome, where thousands are now waiting.
   The U.S. official said new procedures will save the money spent
on them in Rome or Vienna, estimated at more than $30 million, and
allow it to be used to increase emigration.
   The new procedure also is intended to cut down on the long lines
outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The line to receive an
application was said at one point to include thousands of people,
and a spot at the front of the line reportedly cost hundreds of
dollars in bribes to Soviet police.
   Jews and Armenians together still make up the vast majority of
the applicants, but U.S. officials are seeing large increases in
applications from others.
   They said 10 percent, or more than 1,000, of the applicants in
August, were ethnic Russians, few with relatives in the United
States.
   One would-be applicant, 18-year-old Vladimir Azarov of Moscow,
said he had some brushes with the law because of his political
views and wanted to receive political refugee status.
   ``It's not that I have a big reason to leave the Soviet Union,
it's just that I want to live in the United States,'' he said.

   The 40-year-old entertainer collapsed Sunday at Kennedy Airport
as he was about to board a plane for London, where he was to

   Jerry Lee Lewis could blow up, sort of
like great balls of fire, if a court-appointed rustee tries to
inspect the rock 'n' roll pioneer's Mississippi home for a
bankruptcy court, his lawyer says.
   Lewis' attorney, Norman Hagemeyer, said inspection requests
haven't been honored because Lewis ``may not be able to control''
himself if trustee George W. Emerson shows up at his home.
   ``You need to tell Mr. Lewis that I'm the bad guy, if anybody's
the bad guy,'' U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William Houston Brown said
Tuesday in ordering the star to cooperate with officials. ``Mr.
Lewis needs to understand that this court is serious about saying
that Mr. Lewis doesn't get special treatment.''
   Lewis filed under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in
November to resolve his reported $3 million in debts. He claims
personal and household items are worth about $5,000.
   Emerson retained Memphis attorney Blanchard Tual, an
entertainment law specialist, who told the judge he needs to look
at Lewis' accounting books. Tual cited the recent movie on Lewis'
life, ``Great Balls of Fire,'' as a possible income source.
   ``In all probability, we'll find some income,'' Tual said.

   Robert Young, 47, previously was convicted of the charge and
sentenced to seven years, but his conviction was overturned and a
new trial was ordered.
   He pleaded guilty Monday in Ontario Supreme Court to the charge
arising from his association with a $5 million drug ring.
   Justice John O'Driscoll told Young he probably would be sent to
jail for 2{ years when he's sentenced Dec. 8.
   Young helped arrange a 136 kilogram hashish deal in 1982 for two

<TEXT>
   Veteran U.S. space researcher James A.
Van Allen received the prestigious Crafoord Prize from Swedish King
Carl XVI Gustaf on Wednesday for his pioneering exploration of
space.
   Sweden's Royal Academy of Sciences, which also awards the Nobel
science prizes, in particular cited Van Allen's discovery in 1958
of the earth's high-energy radiation belts that were named after
him.
   Van Allen, 74, of the University of Iowa, developed new rockets
and space instruments used in launching the first U.S. satellites
and in discovering the magnetic fields shrouding other planets, the
academy said.
   Van Allen, who brought 15 family members, including his five
children and five grandchildren to Stockholm, said receiving the
Crafoord Prize was the biggest thrill of his long scientific career.
   ``Absolutely, there's no doubt about it,'' Van Allen said.
``It's the highest award one can possibly get in this field.''
   ``The biggest surprise was the selection of this field as
subject matter for this award,'' said Van Allen, who received the
prize from the king at a ceremony in the Royal Academy of Sciences
building.
   Van Allen said he had planned to come to Stockholm anyway,
having been invited to a symposium before the prize was announced
and awarded. About 75 of the world's leading space scientists and
officials from several big space projects will participate in the
Sept. 28-29 symposium at the Royal Academy of Sciences.
   The Crafoord Prize has been awarded since 1982 to supplement the
Nobel sciences, which were limited under Alfred Nobel's will to
chemistry, physics and medicine. Americans have won or shared the
prestigious Crafoord Prize every year since the inauguration.
   The prize was worth $252,000 this year.
   Van Allen is the so-called ``principal investigator'' on the
Pioneer 1 and 11 missions, both of which are continuing and in
which he is actively working. He is also an interdisciplinary
scientist on the forthcoming Galileo mission to Jupiter.
   Van Allen was cited for providing the first instruments ever
carried to another planet, those aboard the 1963 mission to Venus
by Mariner II.
   His instruments also were on the Pioneer space probes to
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, measuring the magnetic fields
around those planets that trap belts of particles similar to those
around the earth.
   His 1958 discovery of what were later named the Van Allen Belts
disclosed the existence of broad bands of highly energetic
particles surrounding the earth.
   Born in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, Van Allen studied at the
University of Iowa, where he returned in the 1960s to establish the
leading space science institute in the United States, producing
many of today's leaders in space research.
   In 1981, Van Allen was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences as one of its 150 foreign members. The Academy has 360
Swedish members.

   Forrest Hill High School won't stop anyone
from waving Confederate battle flags at school events, but the
school board is adopting another flag as the official one.
   On Tuesday, the Jackson School Board voted 2-1 to approve a plan
recommended by a committee of parents, students and teachers to
select a new flag, which will be unveiled before the Oct. 19
football game.
   Many students and parents had opposed a plan to stop using the
Confederate flag as the school flag after some said they found it
racially offensive.
   About 200 parents and students packed Tuesday's meeting room and
spilled outside, where members of the Jackson Association of
Concerned Parents paraded and waved large Rebel flags.
   Earlier this month, Forest Hill officials notified students that
the Rebel flag wouldn't be allowed on campus or at any school
event. When several students carried flags to an on-campus football
game, administrators confiscated them and made the students leave.
   That won't be done in the future, however.
   ``We're not going to be collecting any more flags because that's
interfering with somebody's constitutional right, but we're going
to discourage students from waving it,'' Deputy Superintendent Dan
Merritt said.
   ``The Jackson School Board should be commended for no longer
remaining thunderingly silent on the issue of the Confederate
flag,'' said state Rep. Aaron Henry of Clarksdale, state president
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
``To those of you who wave the flag, you're doing a good job of
causing a negative feeling within the black community.''

   Darlington Hoopes, twice the Socialist
candidate for president and a former Pennsylvania state legislator,
has died.
   Hoopes, 93, died Monday at the Leader Nursing and Rehabilitation
Center in Spring Township near Reading. He died of natural causes,
according to his son, Darlington Hoopes Jr.
   Hoopes ran for president on the Socialist ticket in 1952 against
Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower and Democrat Adlai E. Stevenson.
His campaign cost him only $150.
   He called for nationalization of banks, railroads, coal mines
and the steel industry and for strengthening the United Nations and
reuniting East and West Germany.
   ``The wealthy have long used the power of government to enrich
themselves. In a democracy, government is a tool that should be
used to advance the common welfare,'' he said in a radio address
shortly before the 1952 election. He received 21,000 votes to
Eisenhower's 33 million.
   Hoopes also ran for president in 1956. He was the Socialists'
vice presidential candidate in 1944.
   Hoopes studied agriculture at the University of Wisconsin, but
then turned to law, receiving his legal education largely through
correspondence courses.
   He practiced law in Reading, a base for Socialist political
sentiment in the 1930s and '40s. He served as national chairman of
the Socialist Party for 20 years and was elected to three terms in
the Pennsylvania legislature in the 1930s.
   In 1933, Hoopes introduced and helped pass the state's child
labor law.
   Hoopes, a Quaker, was a native of Harford County, Md. He is
survived by his wife, Hazelette, two sons and a daughter.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday that he won't be
``deterred by rumors'' that Colombian drug lords have made threats
against his five children, but he confirmed that security had been
increased for his family.
   ``I have confidence in the Secret Service and their ability to
do their job,'' Bush told a group of reporters in the Oval Office.
   The president was skeptical of a published report that drug
lords had threatened to kidnap one of his children if U.S. and
Colombian governments don't grant them amnesty. Bush has pledged an
all-out war against Colombian drug traffickers.
   The story, in Wednesday's editions of New York Newsday, quoted
unidentified Washington intelligence sources.
   However, Bush said intelligence officials never mentioned such a
threat to him, ``and I have a feeling that that matter is of enough
interest to me that it would have been brought to my attention.''
   ``I don't mean to be complacent, but I have confidence in our
intelligence community,'' Bush said.
   Although heightened security had been noticed recently around
Bush's family, it was the first time anyone in the government had
confirmed it publicly.
   There had been earlier reports of possible threats by Colombian
drug figures against the president's family and U.S. officials.
That icluded congressional testimony earlier this month from a
former drug dealer who suggested hit squads already might be in
this country.
   ``To the degree security has been stepped up in accordance with
the law and the Bush kids, it is not because of a specific, hard
piece of intelligence, hard threat. I'm confident of that,'' Bush
said.
   ``So, I don't live in fear of anything like this. ... I can't do
my job if I get deterred by rumors,'' he said.
   Newsday quoted the intelligence sources as saying they believed
the most vulnerable to a kidnapping was Bush's youngest child,
Dorothy LeBlond, 30, a Portland, Maine, businesswoman.
   The Bushes also have four sons: George, John, Neil and Marvin.
   The sources told the newspaper the kidnap threat also applied to
top U.S. officials involved in anti-drug efforts.
   Secret Service spokesman Richard Abrams would neither confirm
nor deny that protection for the Bush family was increased.
   ``Security is always tight, as you know,'' Abrams said.
   Initially the Bush children had resisted extra security, but all
finally agreed to an increased Secret Service presence, Newsday
reported.
   Adding fuel to speculation of Colombian hit squads was the
arrest in New Brunswick, Canada, earlier this month of five men
with an arsenal of weapons, Venezuelan papers and links with
Colombian suspects in a drug-trafficking case.
   Canadian officials said there was a link between the arrested
men and a hearing for two Colombians suspected of cocaine
trafficking, although they denied that any U.S. or Canadian
official was in danger.
   However, the men were carrying maps of New Brunswick and
neighboring Maine, where Bush's daughter lives and where he has a
family vacation home in Kennebunkport.
   Police said several locations were highlighted on the maps, but
refused to say what they were.

<HEAD>Nationwide Strike Against Austerity Measures Shuts Down Haiti</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Almost all businesses were closed
and public transportation was halted Wednesday in a nationwide
strike called to protest the military government's austerity
measures.
   The hugely successful 24-hour strike was called by 32 different
groups representing farmers, workers, opposition parties and
others. Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, the military ruler, had predicted
the strike would fail.
   Police offered free rides in government trucks but, unlike
during previous strikes, there were no long lines of residents
waiting for them.
   The normally crowded and bustling downtown sidewalks were empty
as all street vendors stayed home. The outdoor market also was
empty in the wealthy suburb of Petionville, which usually does not
heed strike calls.
   Almost all factories at the industrial park on the north side of
this city of 1 million were closed.
   The strike was called to protest last month's austerity
measures, which include an increase in tariffs on imports and a
lowering of the ceiling on taxable businesses to include those that
earn as little as $25,000 a year. Other measures included a price
hike for some staple foods.
   Avril's government said the measures would allow Haiti, one of
the world's poorest nations, to qualify for aid from several
lending institutions, including a $26.5 million loan from the
International Monetary Fund.
   The strike was one of the most successful since dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in February 1986.
Unions as well as management appeared to back it. In previous
strikes, factory owners kept plants open for any employee who
wanted to work.
   ``For the first time since (Duvalier's departure) everybody has
unanimously rejected the socio-economic policy of the government,''
opposition leader Hubert De Ronceray told The Associated Press.
   The strike shut down all provincial towns, though in the north
coast city of Cap Haitien a few businesses opened, radio stations
said.
   ``The government has decreed tax measures in an underhanded,
dictatorial way, harmful to the majority of the people,'' said
Jean-Claude Roy, head of the Union of Haitian Constitutionalists
party.
   The groups backing the strike included Haiti's biggest union,
the Autonomous Central of Haitian Workers; the communist party, the
center-leftist Congress of Democratic Movements party; and the
Papaye Peasants Movement, the largest farmers group in Haiti.
   The Chamber of Commerce and the Haitian Association of
Industrialists have strongly criticized the austerity measures,
saying they will cause a ``social explosion.'' Though they did not
formally back the strike, they appeared to tacitly support it since
virtually all businesses and factories were closed.
   Avril told The Associated Press on Monday the strike would fail.
He came to power in a soldiers' coup in September 1988, ousting Lt.
Gen. Henri Namphy, who assumed power when Duvalier left.

   A transplant drug that suppresses the immune
system appears to relieve severe Crohn's disease, a lingering
inflammation of the digestive tract, according to a report.
   Danish doctors found that the medicine, called cyclosporine,
seemed to help some people who did not respond to standard
treatment with steroid drugs.
   Cyclosporine is ordinarily used to stop the body's rejection of
transplanted organs. While useful, the drug can damage the kidneys.
   The disease, which affects the intestines, causes recurring
attacks of cramps and diarrhea. Symptoms are relatively mild in
about three-quarters of victims.
   The latest study was conducted by Dr. Jorn Brynskov and
colleagues at Herlov University Hospital in Copenhagen. It was
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   During three months of treatment, 22 of 37 patients given
cyclosporine showed improvement, compared with 11 of 34 of those
who took placebos. During a three-month followup, the improvement
continued to 38 percent of the cyclosporine patients and 15 percent
in the comparison group.
   The researchers said their results were ``rather encouraging,''
but they said more study is needed, and this treatment should be
limited for now to formal research experiments.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. David B. Sachar of Mt. Sinai
School of Medicine in New York said the research ``establishes a
new treatment for Crohn's disease that works.''
   He said the best use of the drug may be to ``induce a quick
fix'' in serously ill patients who fail to respond to steroids.
This could buy time for slower-acting long-term medicines to take
effect.

   U.S. Rep. Arthur Ravenel, whose
congressional district bore the brunt of Hurricane Hugo, said he
wore a life jacket and huddled in a back bedroom as he rode out the
storm in his harborfront home.
   ``It was like a 10-ton truck that ran into the side of the
house,'' Ravenel said from his Washington office Tuesday.
   The Republican lawmaker said the first part of the storm, which
packed 135 mph winds, wasn't too bad as he sat in his Mount
Pleasant home, across the harbor from Charleston. The area was not
under a mandatory evacuation order.
   ``Then the eye crossed,'' the congressman said. ``The pictures
started thumping off of the walls and crashing on the floor. I have
a tin roof and the roof started ripping off the house. The house
just started to vibrate like it contained electricity.
   ``I thought for a few minutes it was going to collapse,'' he
said. ``I retreated to the back of the house and put on a life
preserver.''
   Ravenel said he started to sit in the bathtub, but decided not
to when he saw that the bathroom window was too small to escape
through. He then stayed in a small bedroom in the back of the house.
   ``When I woke in the morning, I could not believe the
devastation,'' he said. Part of the roof of his cedar-shingled
house was missing, windows were blown out, his dock and small
fishing boat swept away, and ``big magnificent oaks were torn to
shreds.''
   The congressman said he's been working with his staff to help
constituents apply for assistance as soon as the Federal Emergency
Management Agency opens offices.
   About 300,000 residences or buildings remained without power
throughout South Carolina Wednesday. An estimated 50,000 of
Charleston's 65,000 residents were still out of their homes, Mayor
Joseph P. Riley Jr. said.

<HEAD>Study: Shooting Galleries Help Explain Racial Difference in AIDS
Infection</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EDT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of ghetto shooting galleries to share
needles may help explain why AIDS infections are more common among
black and Hispanic drug addicts than among white users, a study
concludes.
   The study, conducted in a methadone treatment program in New
York City, found that use of shooting galleries was the single most
important difference between those who got infected and those who
did not.
   Blacks and Hispanics were more likely than whites to go to
shooting galleries, places where drug abusers buy or rent needles
to inject drugs.
   ``It is clear that the social milieu in which drugs are
injected, not just the number of injections, is a powerful
predictor of the transmission of HIV,'' the AIDS virus, the
researchers wrote.
   The study was conducted by Dr. Ellie E. Schoenbaum and
colleagues at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. It was
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Among the 452 people who took part in the study, the AIDS
infection rate was 49 percent in blacks, 42 percent in Hispanics
and 17 percent in non-Hispanic whites.
   While the blacks and Hispanics were more likely to frequent
shooting galleries, the whites were more apt to share needles with
friends and relatives.
   ``Shooting galleries are particularly well suited for the
transmission of HIV, since used needles are usually rented and then
reused by strangers or acquaintances,'' they wrote. ``In our study,
drug users who shared needles with strangers or acquaintances were
at high risk for HIV infection, whereas those who shared with close
friends or relatives were at lower risk.''
   Two-thirds of those took more than 25 percent of their drug
injections in shooting galleries were infected, compared with less
than one-third of those who never went there.
   The study also found that the risk of AIDS infection increased
by 24 percent with each sex partner who used intravenous drugs.

<HEAD>Parliament Approves New Political Freedom of Speech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Wednesday adopted a law
giving people the right to express opinions or advocate political
and social change, further expanding freedom of speech before
multiparty elections next year.
   The bill and a related amendment of the criminal procedure law
are part of a package of legislation designed to bring Hungary's
laws in line with moves toward a pluralistic system and with
international covenants on human rights.
   Under the penal code amendment, which takes effect immediately,
expressing one's private opinion or advocating political or social
change can no longer be considered crimes.
   Hungary's rapid liberalization has allowed a degree of free
expression that would have been difficult even one year ago.
Opposition leaders can have their say in the official media, and in
most cases people are permitted to demonstrate freely on a wide
range of issues, including such sensitive topics as the withdrawal
of Soviet troops.
   The draft legislation before Parliament must ``create the legal
preconditions for the transition leading to a new constitutional
order and eliminate obstacles in the path of the transformation''
to a multiparty system, Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar said.
   The penal code amendment was designed only to deal with urgent
matters, and a comprehensive penal code reform is under way,
Kulcsar said.
   Jozsef Debreczeni, one of four new members of Parliament who
belong to the opposition and received the majority vote in recent
by-elections _ the first in which Hungarians had a genuine choice
of candidates under communist rule _ said a reformed penal code is
needed immediately.
   Under the current legislation, he said, ``the new opposition
parties could be legally charged with conspiracy to overthrow the
established constitutional order.''
   Parliament is drafting a new constitution that is to ensure
separation of powers, guarantee human rights and remove all
references to a one-party state. But it is not to be formally
adopted until after elections, due by June, when the new Parliament
has begun work.
   Hungary's Communist Party has agreed to relinquish its leading
role and to enter into free elections with independent parties,
even pledging to go into opposition if it loses.
   On Tuesday, Parliament adopted new emigration and travel laws
that will allow unprecedented freedom of movement to Hungarians and
allow those who emigrated for personal, or even for political
reasons, to return home if they wish.

<HEAD>Cheney: Soviets Remain Most Formidable Foe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, releasing the
Pentagon's annual assessment of Soviet military might, said
Wednesday that Congress should not impose spending cuts ``in
anticipation of a kinder, gentler Soviet Union.''
   The secretary warned that the Soviet Union continues to
modernize its armed forces and will remain the world's largest
military power even if Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev makes
good on his promised cutbacks and pledges of reform.
   ``In sum, we now find a Soviet Union which retains enormous
military power, the only nation still capable of threatening the
very survival of the United States,'' Cheney said at a Pentagon
briefing. ``Prudence, therefore, dictates that we maintain our
defenses while we wait and see about Soviet developments.''
   Cheney issued the report, ``Soviet Military Power,'' as Congress
debates Pentagon spending cuts.
   The Senate on Tuesday voted to trim President Bush's Star Wars
program by $800 million, a move that could spell the first annual
budget reduction in the space-based, anti-missile shield.
   ``Congress seems determined to want to take cuts in the defense
budget in anticipation of a kinder, gentler Soviet Union,'' Cheney
complained during his meeting with reporters.
   The secretary said that in the midst of ``all the hope and
optimism'' about prospects for arms accords and a less threatening
international environment, Americans must remember ``the United
States faces a more formidable offensive strategic arsenal than
when Gorbachev came to power.''
   He said Congress should go along with the president's requests
for Star Wars, the B-2 Stealth bomber, the submarine-launched
Trident missile and a mobile missile force in order to counter
Soviet improvements.
   At the White House, Bush said Cheney's message was ``good
advice'' for both the administration and Congress.
   ``He's saying don't do something dumb. Don't make the mistake of
unilaterally disarming _ knocking out significant strategic
modernization programs at the very minute that the Soviet Union is
going forward,'' Bush said in an Oval Office exchange with
reporters.
   The annual study, which in its early editions under the Reagan
administration was derided on Capitol Hill and outside government
as an overblown estimate of the Soviet military's effectiveness,
has evolved amid the changing U.S.-Soviet relationship.
   Now sprinkled among its 159 pages are a photo of Gorbachev
garnering support for his reforms at a Communist Party Conference,
a picture of ethnic demonstrations in a Baltic Republic and a
snapshot showing Adm. William Crowe Jr. and Soviet military leader
Gen. Sergei Akhromeyev reviewing troops at the Pentagon.
   Whereas previous volumes made references to Soviet intentions of
world domination, the new volume notes that the likelihood for
conflict between the superpowers ``is as low as it has been at any
time in the postwar era.''
   But it also portrays the Soviets as an extremely formidable foe
facing a United States that ``grapples'' with such things as the
selection of a mobile missile force.
   Cheney insisted that the first version of the publication to be
issued on his watch was an attempt to be fair and accurate about
the threat the United States faces.
   ``My point here today is not to in any way be critical of the
reforms efforts we see Mr. Gorbachev undertaking,'' Cheney said,
adding that the Pentagon has been ``extremely supportive'' of the
move to engage the Soviets in the arms control arena.
   Cheney called the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan a
``significant development.'' It is pictured on the cover of the
report.
   The report also cites Gorbachev's announcement of significant
cuts in conventional forces, reductions in the Soviet defense
budget and weapons procurement, and the U.S.-Soviet arms control
agreement on banning intermediate-range missiles in Europe.
   Cheney said he'd like to see Gorbachev's announced intentions
enacted, as well as continued U.S.-Soviet efforts to reduce
conventional arms in Europe, reach a treaty on strategic nuclear
weapons and increase military-to-military exchanges.
   The secretary announced that next week he intends to play host
to Soviet defense minister Gen. Dmitri Yazov during a week-long
visit to the United States.
   Among other Soviet military developments, he cited:
   _Despite Gorbachev's announced 14.2 percent reduction in Soviet
defense spending, outlays since 1985 have increased by an average
of 3 percent a year in real terms.
   _The Soviets are deploying a new, silo-based SS-18
intercontinental ballistic missile with 10 warheads each while they
continue to field 170 SS-25 road-mobile missiles and some 18
rail-mobile SS-18s.
   _The Soviets have augmented their strategic ballistic missile
submarine force by launching the sixth units of the Typhoon and
Delta IV-class submarines.
   _While the Soviets are unilaterally withdrawing some ground
forces opposite NATO, they are reorganizing and modernizing their
general purpose forces, upgrading their communications networks and
researching future generations of weapons systems.
   _Even though a ``significant trend'' was sighted of lessened
Soviet naval operations in waters far from the homeland, new major
surface combat ships were added to the fleet.

<HEAD>DC-9 Aborts Takeoff After Wind Shear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian DC-9 jetliner rolled off a
runway Wednesday after its takeoff was aborted because of suddenly
shifting winds, airline officials said. No serious injuries were
reported.
   The ATI airline jet, carrying 102 people, was taking off from
Palermo's Punta Raisi Airport for a flight to Milan when it
experienced the condition known as wind shear, said airport
director Ignazio Bonaccorsio.
   ``As a consequence, the airplane, while maintaining power, lost
speed and altitude, retouching the ground. At this point, action of
the flight crew was masterful. Even on a runway drenched with rain
they did not lose control of the aircraft,'' he said.
   Wind shear is a dangerous downdraft associated with severe
thunderstorms that has been known to cause aircraft accidents.
   Airline officials said a man with a heart condition was
hospitalized for observation as a precaution and a women was
treated for a cut caused by a beverage cart that broke loose during
the landing.
   The DC-9 Super 80 of the domestic airline was on a scheduled
flight to Milan with 98 passengers and a crew of four when the
pilot aborted the takeoff at about 3:30 p.m., an airline official
said.
   The company issued a statement that did not mention wind shear.
It said only that the pilot made the decision to abort because of a
sudden change in the weather and because he still had time to abort
the takeoff safely.
   The aircraft suffered no apparent damage when it touched down on
the runway and rolled off.

   The Senate voted overwhelmingly for a
bipartisan $9.4 billion anti-drug package today, with leaders of
both parties saying their two weeks of contentious bargaining had
produced an effective and needed plan.
   ``This is the first step,'' Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., his
party's chief negotiator during the just-concluded talks, said
before the 97-2 vote. ``Weak shots across the bow will not cripple
the garbage scow of drug violence and drug dependency.''
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., who led the GOP negotiating team
during the bargaining that began Sept. 15, said the package
addresses a problem that is being battled in every congressional
district.
   ``The troops are out there,'' said Hatfield. ``All they're
waiting for is the orders, a plan of attack, and they're ready to
march.''
   Agreement on the proposal, nailed down Thursday night, ended a
fight between the two parties that had blocked Senate passage of
spending bills for the new fiscal year that begins Sunday.
   Its eye on the calendar, the Senate passed two spending measures
for fiscal 1990 late Tuesday: a $14.4 billion foreign aid package
and a $157.4 billion measure for labor, health and education
programs.
   But with congressional leaders convinced lawmakers will never
finish all 13 annual appropriations bills by the Oct. 1 start of
the new federal budget year, the House adopted legislation keeping
government agencies operating through Oct. 25.
   ``We have no alternative,'' complained the ranking Republican on
the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Silvio Conte of
Massachusetts.
   The Senate action came after Republicans lifted the roadblock
they threw two weeks ago in front of spending measures while they
and Democrats searched for a compromise on a broad package of
anti-drug programs.
   When a deal among Democrats, Republicans and the White House for
a beefed-up drug plan was announced, the Senate's legislative
logjam dissolved and things moved quickly.
   Senators voted 89-11 to adopt the foreign aid bill, boosting
assistance to the new non-commmunist government of Poland to $45
million. President Bush has sought $35 milion less for the first
annual installment of a three-year commitment he detailed at $119
million, exclusive of $100 million in food aid handled in a
separate bill.
   The measure also brings U.S. military aid to El Salvador to $90
million, a $5 million addition to this year's total.
   Lawmakers also adopted, by 81-19, a $157.4 billion measure for
labor, health and education programs that includes slightly relaxed
abortion restrictions. The measure expands the Medicaid program for
the poor to pay for abortions to women made pregnant by rape or
incest. Currently, only mothers whose lives are threatened qualify
for assistance.
   House-Senate negotiators must now write compromise versions of
both measures before offering them to Bush for his signature. So
far, only one of the 13 annual spending bills has been sent to the
White House.
   Senate passage of a $67.2 billion package for veterans, housing
and space programs was delayed while lawmakers weighed adding aid
for victims of last week's Hurricane Hugo.
   Also held up was final approval of an $11.9 billion
transportation measure. The anti-drug package was to be inserted
into that bill before its passage.
   Senate leaders said that when added to the $7.9 billion Bush has
already proposed, the new anti-drug package will bring next year's
spending on the drug problem to $9.4 billion. Some $600 million of
the total, however, had previously been proposed by Congress.
   Of the remaining $900 million senators agreed to seek, $100
million would be for law enforcement and the rest for treatment,
education and rehabilitation.
   Overall, the package would tack nearly $3.2 billion to the
government's $5.7 billion anti-drug effort this year.
   The extra spending would come from a 0.43 percent cut on federal
spending, with social security and other benefit programs exempted.
   Final agreement on the anti-drug package came when the Senate's
Democratic leaders agreed to let the chamber consider a Republican
anti-crime package later this year.
   The measure will contain many of the elements of a measure Bush
proposed in June, including such items as widening the application
of the death penalty, limiting appeals by some prisoners and making
it easier for police to obtain evidence.

   Preliminary payments totaling $248 million are
going out to states as their share of national forest sales
receipts collected this fiscal year, the Agriculture Department
said Wednesday.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said total state
shares for the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, are expected to be
more than $331 million, up from $318 million last year.
   By law, 25 percent of the revenues collected by the agency for
the sale of timber and other uses of national forest resources must
be returned to the states where the forests are located. The states
are required to use the money for schools and roads.
   The 10 largest preliminary payments will go to Oregon, $118
million; California, $39 million; Washington, $33 million; Idaho,
$7 million; Arkansas, $6.2 million; Montana, $5.4 million; Arizona,
$5.3 million; Alaska, $3.2 million; Pennsylvania, $2.8 million; and
Mississippi, $2.6 million.

   A sightseeing plane crashed on a wooded
hill a half-mile from a runway at the Grand Canyon airport today,
killing at least 10 people and seriously injuring the 11 others
aboard, authorities said.
   The twin-engine Grand Canyon Airlines plane went down at 9:49
a.m. MST, said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elly
Brekke. There were conflicting reports on whether the plane was
landing or taking off.
   Mitch Strohman, a reporter for Flagstaff radio station KAFF,
said the wreckage lay on a heavily wooded hill and did not catch
fire. The airport is five miles from the Grand Canyon.
   Sheriff's Capt. Sam Whitted said the 11 survivors were being
taken to hospitals.
   Ms. Brekke said the plane hit trees, flipped over and crashed
after veering on its landing approach. Elizabeth Seibold, owner of
Grand Canyon Airlines, said the plane was on a sightseeing flight
and was coming in for a landing.
   However, Lt. Jim Driscoll said the plane crashed on takeoff.
   ``We don't know if lost power or what. ... It started banking to
the east and then went down,'' he said. He said it hit a power line.
   The FAA spokeswoman said the National Transportation Safety
Board would send an investigation team.
   In 1986, a Grand Canyon Airlines plane collided with a
sightseeing helicopter inside the canyon, killing 25 people. In
1956, a TWA plane and a United aircraft collided over the canyon
and 128 were killed.

<HEAD>Iranian Offers to Pay Damages in Exchange for Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lebanese man serving a life sentence for the
attempted assassination of a former Iranian prime minister said
Wednesday he would pay damages to the victims of his attack in
exchange for his release from prison.
   In a statement issued by his lawyers, Anis Naccache said his
proposal would improve France-Iranian relations. There was no
immediate response from the French government to the proposal.
   The lawyers, Jacques Verges and Antoine Comte, also told
reporters that their client had nothing to do with last week's
crash of a French airliner en route from N'Djamena, Chad, to Paris.
   There has been speculation that the UTA flight, on which 171
people died, could have been bombed in an effort to press for
Naccache's release.
   Iranian officials have called publicly for Naccache to be freed,
but France has denied widespread reports that it agreed last year
to free him as part of a deal for the release of the remaining U.S.
hostages in Iran.
   Naccache led a five-man team that tried to kill Shahpour
Bakhtiar, the last Iranian premier before the Islamic Revolution,
outside his Paris exile home in 1980. Bakhtiar was unhurt, but a
neighbor and a policeman were killed and three other people injured.
   At his trial, Naccache said he was carrying out orders from
Iran's Islamic authorities.
   Naccache's statement also urged the release of the four others
convicted in the attack.
   Comte said the precise amount Naccache would pay those injured
in the attack and relatives of those killed had not been set, but
would amount to ``several million francs.'' One million francs is
equivalent to about $160,000.
   Asked where Naccache could get the money, Comte said ``one can
deduce'' that Iran would help pay for his release.

<HEAD>West Germans Dismiss Allegations of Blunders Before Pan Am Bombing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday
dismissed as ``pure speculation'' a British TV report alleging West
German investigators committed major blunders before the Pan Am
bombing over Scotland in December.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. current affairs program
``Panorama'' earlier this week said one blunder allegedly made by
the West Germans was the release of the suspected bomb maker two
months before the jet was blown up.
   ``This (report) is pure speculation,'' chief government
spokesman Hans Klein told reporters in Bonn.
   Another high-ranking government official said that nine months
after Pan Am Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, U.S., British and
West German investigators still have ``no clear knowledge'' about
who was responsible for the bombing.
   All 259 people aboard Flight 103 from Frankfurt to New York via
London were killed in the Dec. 21 attack, along with 11 people on
the ground in Lockerbie.
   Hans Neusel, the No. 2 official in the Interior Ministry,
repeated West German doubts that the bomb had been loaded onto the
flight in Frankfurt.
   There was no evidence on whether the bomb was placed aboard the
plane in Frankfurt or London and investigators remained in the dark
about the kind of detonator used, Neusel said.
   In an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio station, Neusel said
West German investigators have found no links between members of a
radical Palestinian group arrested in West Germany in October 1988
and the Pan Am bombing two months later.
   West German authorities arrested 16 suspected members of the
Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, but quickly released 14 of them, citing a lack of evidence.
   Among those released was a Jordanian, Marwan Khreesat. The
``Panorama'' program said Khreesat is a known bomb maker and is
widely believed by British and U.S. investigators to have made the
Lockerbie bomb and several others.
   The program said Khreesat was in hiding in Jordan and that the
West Germans apparently released him because he was a double agent
who was also working for Jordanian intelligence.
   Two of those seized in October remain in custody on other
bombing charges, including Hafez Kassem Dalkamoni, a top aide to
PFLP-GC leader Ahmed Jabril.
   In a U.S. television interview in April, Jabril denied that his
group had any role in the Pan Am bombing. But he said Dalkamoni
often built and used the type of bomb that blew up Flight 103.
   The BBC program said that investigators were convinced that
PFLP-GC masterminded the attack. The group has long been the prime
suspect.
   In a statement distributed in Britain and Bonn, Lord Fraser,
chief legal officer of Scotland, said he found the ``Panorama''
program ``extremely interesting and clearly it was the product of
considerable work.''
   Lord Fraser said his legal position prevented him from
commenting on any specific allegations.

   All roads once were said to lead to Rome, but
the Automobile Club of New York seems to think they all now grind
to a halt in midtown Manhattan.
   In an attempt to list the 10 most congested roads in the
metropolitan area, the club said Wednesday that every street
between 34th and 59th streets in Manhattan should qualify as a
motorist's nightmare and lumped them together as one.
   It blamed double parking, heavy pedestrian volume, lack of
traffic signal coordination and lack of off-street parking and
loading zones for stifling congestion, ``virtually any day, any
time.''
   One other of the nine roads winning the dubious gridlock honors
was in Manhattan _ Chambers Street, a main crosstown route from the
Brooklyn Bridge to the West Side. The rest of the roads were in the
city's other boroughs and suburbs.

   Boot camp veterans may think of drill
sergeants as people who cause rather than suffer anxiety, but the
Army is planning stress management programs for the sergeants, and
for their wives.
   The training already has been implemented at Fort Sill, Okla.,
and Fort Leonard Wood, Mo.
   The program will highlight pressures facing drill sergeants and
offer ways to deal with that stress, said Sgt. Maj. William Mayo of
Fort Benning's Infantry Training Center Command. And it is designed
to show the sergeants' wives what their husbands go through, he
said.
   The 13-week program, to be offered every four months, will
``give the drill sergeants a release to talk about their anxiety,''
Mayo said. ``The wives, too, because they spend a lot of time
alone. The husband can see what the wives are going through and
maybe we can provide a better understanding of what's really on the
mind of soldiers and their wives.''
   He said drill sergeants work 14 hours a day during a two-year
tour and the wives seldom see their husbands during that time. Mayo
said studies have shown that drill sergeants experience the most
stress during the first nine to 12 months of their duty tour.

<HEAD>Negligence Still a Threat, Public Citizen Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although more physicians are being disciplined
by state regulators, lax treatment of negligence still poses a
serious risk to public health, a health research group said
Wednesday.
   State licensing boards took serious disciplinary actions _
license revocation, suspension or probation _ against 1,495
physicians in 1987, a 17 percent increase over the previous year,
said a Public Citizen Health Research Group report.
   Nationally, that's a rate of nearly three serious actions for
every 1,000 doctors.
   But some states continue to be more vigilant than others in
weeding out bad doctors, and in some states physicians can still
``operate drunk, commit a gross act of negligence or sexually
assault a patient and receive a mere slap on the wrist,'' the
report said.
   The numbers are based on actions reported by the Federation of
State Medical Boards, whose executive vice president, Bryant
Galusha, agreed that the number of actions has been increasing but
said the Public Citizen report does not present a full picture.
   Galusha said the group failed to tally the 1,106 remedial
actions state boards took in 1987, by which physicians are allowed
to continue practicing with certain limitations. Also, not all
actions taken are disciplinary in nature, such as when a board
denies a license, he said.
   ``These protect the public, too,'' Galusha said.
   Public Citizen estimates that more than 100,000 Americans are
injured or killed each year because of physicians' negligence, and
that lax treatment of physicians' negligence ``is one of the most
serious threats to the health of American patients.''
   The public interest group, associated with Ralph Nader, said
serious disciplinary actions against physicians have more than
doubled since 1984, and attributes the rise to ``a spate of adverse
publicity and state and federal legislation.''
   During 1987 and 1988, 44 state legislatures strengthened state
oversight of physicians, the group said.
   Also, the federation's Physician Disciplinary Data Bank, a
computerized network linking all the state boards, has made it
easier for states to keep track of errant doctors, Galusha said.
   ``We're hardly ever seeing a physician, once there's an action
taken against him, pack his bag and go to another state without
being detected. It's very difficult for that to happen now, whereas
five years ago it was done with relative ease,'' Galusha said.
   The most common charge against doctors leading to a serious
disciplinary action is incompetence, said Sidney Wolfe, a physician
and head of the health research group. Other charges include
writing an excessive number of prescriptions for controlled
substances and personally abusing drugs, he said.
   The group recommends raising doctors' licensing fees to $500 per
year to finance doctor disciplinary actions and reduce the backlogs
that plague many state medical boards.
   Public Citizen also recommends periodic recertification of
physicians, giving state boards broader authority to evaluate
doctors and take action against them and requiring insurance
companies to rate doctors so those with the best records pay the
lowest premiums.

<HEAD>Uprising Leaders Returning Confiscated ID Cards Under Pressure</HEAD>
<HEAD>By MARJORIE OLSTER</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian activists have begun returning
Israeli identity cards they had seized from Gaza Strip Arabs who
needed the cards to travel to Israel, Arab sources said Wednesday.
   The return of the cards is a victory for Israel's tighter
security measures to control the uprising in the occupied lands.
The cards apparently were returned because of the economic hardship
their seizure caused Palestinians who have jobs in Israel.
   Israel began issuing the magnetic cards in June and by
mid-August, all Gaza men were required to have a card to enter
Israel as a security precaution.
   The issuing of the cars and the boycott of them declared by the
uprising leaders severely curtailed the entry into Israel of Arabs
who live in the Gaza Strip but work in Israel. About 50,000 Gazans
worked regularly in Israel.
   Fayez Abu Rahme, a prominent Gaza lawyer, acknowledged that the
leaders of the 21-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in the
occuped lands had failed to pressure Israel to halt the magnetic
card project.
   ``Taking the cards from workers means imposing unemployment.
They have no alternative. There are no jobs available in the Gaza
Strip,'' Abu Rahme told The Associated Press.
   ``Denying them the magnetic cards means they have to starve,''
he said.
   The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot reported Wednesday that workers
in Gaza had banded together to resist by force the masked gangs who
were confiscating the cards.
   The gangs hacked to death at least one Palestinian who refused
to hand over his card and threatened hundreds of others.
   According to Yediot, the gangs confiscated 10,000 magnetic cards
since June. About 60,000 have been issued.
   Arab sources said the activists stopped confiscating the cards
two weeks ago and have since allowed Gazans to leave freely for
jobs in Israel.
   ``The authorities have won the battle over the magnetic cards,''
one Palestinian journalist said.
   Also Wednesday, an Israeli human rights organization, the Israel
Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories,
criticized the army's policy of demolishing the homes of
Palestinian suspects as ``a violation of human rights and
international law.''
   The army on demolished a Palestinian home in Gaza City, saying
family members were accused of belonging to illegal uprising
committees or of attacking alleged collaborators with Israel.
   Human rights group Researcher Ronny Talmor told a news
conference that 236 houses were demolished and 98 were sealed shut
by the army to punish Palestinians since the start of the uprising
in December 1987.
   In addition, she said, parts of 60 other homes were destroyed or
sealed.
   ``In the West Bank, only in about 1 percent of the cases the
suspect had been convicted prior to the demolition,'' as compared
with about 10 percent in the Gaza Strip, she said.
   Israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 574 Palestinians in
the revolt against Israel occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, and 40 Israelis have died in the violence. Another 121
Palestinians have been killed by other Arabs, most of them because
they were alleged to be collaborators with Israel.

<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II honored veteran anti-apartheid
canesday by giving her the honorary
title of Dame Commander of the British Empire.
   The award ``recognizes the distinguished contribution which Mrs.
Suzman has made toward fostering relations between this country and
South Africa and in the struggle against apartheid,'' the Foreign
Office said.
   ``Mrs. Suzman has championed the cause of human rights for all
the people of South Africa for more than 40 years,'' it said in a
statement announcing the award.
   Mrs. Suzman, 71, was first elected to South Africa's Parliament
in December 1952 and for many years was the lone representative of
the white liberal Progressive Federal Party. The party, now part of
a new group, is a major opposition party in the present white South
African Parliament.
   Mrs. Suzman, staying with friends in London, said she was
``thrilled and honored ... This is recognition of my stand against
apartheid and my work in keeping alive liberal values which are
shared in Great Britain and elsewhere in the world.''
   Her title is the female equivalent of a knighthood, but since it
is honorary, she cannot call herself Dame Helen, a privilege
reserved for Britons. The award carries much prestige, however, and
entitles Mrs. Suzman to use the initials CBE after her name.
   Britain also plans to set up a new scholarship program for black
South Africans to be called the Helen Suzman Awards, the Foreign
Office said. No details were announced.

<DATELINE>HARSUD, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 5,000 people arrived in a remote
central Indian village Wednesday to protest a dam-building project
that environmentalists say will displace about 1 million people.
   Archaeologists say some of the country's richest prehistoric
sites and oldest fossils also will end up under water when four
dams are built on River Narmada.
   The Save Narmada Committee is battling the government to stop
the project. It staged the two-day protest.
   ``We expect thousands more to come from all parts of the country
Thursday,'' said group spokesman Vinod Raina.
   The Narmada river originates in Madhya Pradesh state and flows
through Maharastra and Gujarat states before emptying into the
Indian Ocean.
   Raina said about 5,000 people arrived Wednesday for the protest
in Harsud, about 150 miles from Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh
state. He said the protesters should number 50,000 by Thursday.
   In addition to the four major dams, the government plans to
build about 3,000 smaller ones on the river and it's 41 tributaries.
   Environmentalists working with the Save Narmada Committee say
the project will flood 864,500 acres of forest and 494,000 acres of
cultivated land. As a result, more than a million people will be
displaced, they say.
   The government says the project is essential because it will
irrigate vast tracts of land in the three states, generate
electricity and solve the drinking water problem in neighboring
Gujarat state, which often suffers from drought.
   It also has said it will provide land for people who are
displaced by the flooding.
   ``But why should we leave our village and the soil where we were
born?'' said Nagin Chand Misrilal, a trader in Harsud, one of 573
villages that will be under water when the dams are completed.
   ``The trouble with people today is that they think the society
is only of human beings and nature is a commodity,'' he said.
   Raina said the protesters will form a human chain in the area.
   ``It will be symbolic in that we will not let the government
destroy our land,'' he said.
   Over the years archaeological teams have found hundreds of
fossils of extinct animals and ancient stone-age implements
fashioned by prehistoric humans.
   Among the activists expected in Harsud were Sunder Lal Bahuguna,
who led a successful campaign against tree cutters in northern
India by urging activists to hug trees to stop cutters.

<TEXT>
   A City Council candidate who landed in
jail because of unrequited love believes he can win over voters
from his cell even if he couldn't woo his girlfriend back with his
aerial antics.
   Mark Roddam was free on $5,000 bond on a burglary charge filed
by his girlfriend and under court order not to see her when he
rented a small airplane Sept. 9 and flew it over the Birmingham
Race Course, where the woman works.
   Jefferson County Judge Robert Cahill didn't take kindly to
Roddam's ignoring his order and put the candidate under a $500,000
bond on a felony charge of burglary, two misdemeanor charges of
rendering a false alarm and wreckless operation of an aircraft.
   The judge said Wednesday that a preliminary hearing will be held
for Roddam on Oct. 18. Roddam, 33, is trying to unseat Bill Myers,
59, a veteran council member and former Birmingham police chief.
The election is Oct. 10.
   ``I do have a chance to win,'' Roddam said this week. ``But with
me in here it kind of puts a damper on things.''
   Although the felony count carries the most serious penalty, up
to 20 years in jail, it was the aircraft misdemeanor that landed
Roddam behind bars.
   Roddam said he wasn't flying exceptionally low, but news cameras
captured the plane buzzing the race course.
   ``Then the judge got mad at me for breaking the order of not
going near her and he gave me the half a million bond. I couldn't
pay that so here I am in jail,'' Roddam said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration also revoked Roddam's flying
license. Roddam, who is a used-car salesman, said he believes he
can win because he has name recognition.
   ``I'll do a better job than Bill Myers ever did,'' Roddam said.
``I know I've got a better personality. And it's obvious I'm better
looking and I'm a whole lot younger.''

<DATELINE>LYON, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov, the 1975
Nobel Peace Prize winner, said Wednesday that a ``very big part of
Soviet territory is an environmental catastrophe area.''
   Sakharov, an activist once held in the Soviet closed city of
Gorky, made his comments during ceremonies at Claude Bernard
University where he was awarded an honorary doctorate.
   The Soviet academician, 68, said the ``catastrophe has never
happened anywhere else as it has in the Soviet Union,'' adding that
it is the ``heritage of Stalinism.''
   Over the past several years, a number of Soviet officials and
newspaper reports have outlined significant problems of air, water
and soil pollution. Experts also cite radiation and health problems
stemming from the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant in the Soviet Ukraine.
   Fyodor Morgun, head of the State Committee for the Protection of
Nature, has said that pollution levels in 102 Soviet cities
affecting more than 50 million people are often 10 times higher
than Soviet laws permit.
   According to U.N. estimates, the Soviet Union is the world's
leading source of sulpher dioxide. And, the Soviet political
journal Novymir reported, the bed of the Neva River in Leningrad
has oil sludge in some areas 25 feet deep and pesticide use in the
Moldavian Republic bordering Romania has poisoned fruit, vegetables
and wine there.

<HEAD>Sununu Meets with Gulf States Congressmen On TEDs Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gulf state lawmakers trying to convince the
White House to abandon regulations that require shrimpers to equip
their nets with trap doors were told Wednesday to justify their
request with scientific findings.
   President Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, said the shrimping
industry should conduct the same kind of scientific studies as the
government in exploring the relationship between shrimping and sea
turtle deaths, according to congressmen who met with Sununu.
   The Commerce Department earlier this month ordered shrimpers to
resume using devices that keep endangered sea turtles from drowning
in their nets.
   Under a congressional mandate to protect the turtles, the
department earlier had promulgated alternative regulations
requiring lifting of the nets every 90 minutes or so to let turtles
escape. It abandoned those rules under a court challenge by
environmental groups.
   Environmentalists argue the timing limits let too many turtles
die and the trap-door mechanisms _ turtle excluder devices, or
TEDs, _ are by far the best way to protect turtles.
   Gulf shrimpers say the devices can be dangerous to use, and
reduce their catches by 10 percent to 30 percent. The shrimping
industry has not been unanimous on the issue _ Atlantic fleets have
generally adopted excluders, and Florida has made it mandatory for
boats using state waters.
   President Bush has agreed to look into the long-running dispute.
   Beginning Oct. 15, shrimpers in the Gulf face fines for not
using the devices, said Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La., who attended
Wednesday's meeting with Sununu.
   Tauzin said that with implementation of the fines less than
three weeks away, ``we have to move fast'' to give the White House
the kind of studies Sununu requested.
   ``We're obviously working with someone who has given what
appears to be a great deal of time and attention to the issue and
does want to find a workable solution,'' Tauzin said. ``We're not
going to miss the opportunity to persue that.''
   Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas, also at the meeting, said in a
statement that shrimpers are not the main culprit in the decline of
the endangered sea turtles, and ``Many shrimpers are beginning to
report accidents and near accidents caused by the use of TEDs.''

   Stroh Brewery Co., Exxon Corp., Citicorp and
other companies withdrew as sponsors of a cable TV special on
forest destruction after a timber and mining group objected to the
program.
   Cable station TBS aired the show Sunday without sponsorship, and
a station official said it will be broadcast again without paid
commercials despite pressure from interest groups.
   The show, produced by the National Audubon Society, was the
first in a four-part series called ``World of Audubon.'' The
segment, ``Ancient Forests: Rage Over Trees,'' is about the
destruction of Pacific Northwest forests.
   Chris Palmer, executive producer of the program, said the show
has a pro-conservation slant but also presents other viewpoints.
   Palmer said Stroh asked him to change the show but he would not.
Stroh was the program's chief sponsor and withdrew $600,000 in
production money, he said.
   ``We did hear from the logging industry. They were asking for us
to ensure the content was accurate,'' Stroh spokeswoman Lacey Logan
said.
   Robert SanGeorge, a spokesman for the National Audubon Society,
said opposition to the program was expressed by the Western States
Land Coalition, which represents mining and timber interests.
   Gerry Hogan, president of entertainment networks for TBS, would
not say how much ad revenue the station lost.
   Other sponsors that pulled out were Sears, Ford, Michelin and
New York Life.

   President Bush's proposal to extend steel
import restraints for 2{ years was swiftly approved by a House
panel Wednesday, as negotations continued with Japan and other
trading partners to carry out its provisions.
   Trade representatives from Japan, South Korea, the European

product-by-product steel trade restrictions.
   The old restraints, which took effect in 1984, expire on

   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills expects to report on the
progress of the talks in a statement on Monday, according to her
spokeswoman, Christina McCown.
   Meanwhile, the House Ways and Means Committee approved on a
voice vote a bill carrying out Bush's program to extend the
restrictions with 29 countries until March 31, 1992.
   The administration hopes that 2{ years will be long enough to
negotiate an end to foreign government subsidies on steel and other
trade practices that the American industry considers unfair.
   The earlier agreements were negotiated by the Reagan
administration in 1984 to give U.S. steelmakers breathing space
from foreign competition and allow them to modernize. At the time,
American firms had been filing trade litigation charging overseas
competitors with employing unfair subsidies and selling imported
steel at less than fair market value.
   The American industry had sought a full five-year extension. But
many steel-using manufacturers argued that the quotas had driven up
prices and caused steel product shortages.
   Bush's plan, announced July 25, was intended as a compromise.
The extension will allow some countries' market shares to rise by 1
percentage point per year until quotas are phased out entirely.
Hills said the yearly increase will be allocated to countries that
exhibit the most willingness to stop subsidizing their domestic
industry.
   The Senate has not yet acted on the plan, which must first be
considered by its Finance Committee. But even opponents who wanted
a longer or shorter extension concede there is little they can do
to stop the Bush program now.
   In 1984, the United States had particular difficulty negotiating
an agreement with Japan, its largest steel trading partner. Japan
finally agreed to cap its share of the American steel market at 5.8
percent, but not before complaining that it was being
``strait-jacketed'' by U.S. demands.

<HEAD>Funds From Drug Seizures to Be Used for Prison Construction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh unveiled
a plan Wednesday to use $229 million seized from drug traffickers
and organized crime rings for construction of more than 3,000
federal prison cells.
   ``We're now taking that money and turning it against those
criminals from whom it was so justly taken. Talk about poetic
justice _ this is that,'' Thornburgh said in a speech to U.S.
attorneys.
   He described the money transfer to the Federal Bureau of Prisons
as a ``down payment'' on President Bush's $1.5 billion proposed
prison expansion.
   Justice Department agencies have seized property worth more than
$1 billion since October 1988, and more than $500 million in
forfeited and liquidated criminal property has been placed in the
Asset Forfeiture Fund, Thornburgh said.
   Of that money, about $150 million was shared with local law
enforcement agencies.
   ``It's, I think, satisfying to think that it's now possible for
a drug dealer to serve time in a forfeiture-financed prison after
being arrested by agents driving a forfeiture-provided automobile
while working in a forfeiture-funded sting operation,'' Thornburgh
said, drawing applause from about 150 prosecutors.
   Recent changes in federal laws have helped in the seizure of
criminals' property, Thornburgh said. The forfeiture fund has grown
in yearly receipts from $27.2 million in 1985 to more than $500
million this year, according to Justice Department statistics.
   Thornburgh also said he will create an executive office for
asset forfeiture to better coordinate the fund.
   ``Our focus as prosecutors has to be attacking these
organizations where it hurts,'' he said of drug traffickers.
``They're only in business for one purpose, and that's to make
money.''

   The military commander of U.S. strategic
defenses, citing the potential threat of military advances by the
Soviet Union, said Wednesday the United States must forge ahead
with its Star Wars space defense programs.
   The statements by Gen. John Piotrowski, commander-in-chief of
the North American Aerospace Defense Command, known as NORAD, comes
a day after the Senate voted down a measure to add $300 million to
the Star Wars program, formally called the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   ``We didn't develop those (anti-satellite) spacecraft for war,''
the general said, adding that U.S. programs are for ``early
warning'' of a possible attack. The Soviet space weaponry, however,
``gives them the type of military capability one would like to
have.''
   Piotrowski made his remarks at a seminar sponsored by the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Painting the U.S. space programs as defensive and those by the
Soviets as offensive, Piotrowski made no mention of advances made
by the superpowers last weekend during talks in Wyoming. The
Soviets pulled back an earlier demand to link long-range strategic
arms talks on U.S. curbs on the Star Wars program.
   Kent Stansberry, the Defense Department's director of defense
and space arms policy, said previously scheduled negotiations
between the United States and the Soviets will resume Friday in
Geneva to work toward a Stragegic Arms Reduction Treaty. An
agreement would cut long-range strategic arms by up to 50 percent.
   The Soviet agreement not to link the treaty with limits on the
U.S. Star Wars program ended a four-year deadlock.
   Stansberry cautioned, however, that the Soviet Union could try
again to put conditions on future arms talks.
   Piotrowski said the United States was ill-prepared to deal with
the Soviets in the event they used weapons against American
satellites.
   ``Would they shoot down a mechanical device in space that was a
threat to security? You bet they would,'' the general said. ``What
would we do?''
   Congress has banned antisatellite tests against objects in
space. Earlier this year, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney called
the lack of space testing for antisatellite weapons the ``single
most vulnerable point'' in U.S. defenses.
   In recent years, Piotrowski said, the United States detected and
tracked about 1,700 missiles launched by the Soviets and other
nations, and needed the ability to track them to assure they did
not pose a threat.
   ``I'm convinced ... we need an anti-satellite weapon to protect
our troops and respond in kind,'' the general said.
   The Star Wars program and the anti-satellite weapons have been
sources of controversy for years. President Reagan first proposed
the space programs in 1983, and his aides said the Star Wars
defense shield would include several hundred large orbiting
platforms equipped with killer rockets and hundreds of supporting
surveillance and tracking satellites.
   Lawmakers have argued that some of the testing would violate the
1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty between the United States and
the Soviet Union.
   Congress on Tuesday voted down a Republican effort to restore
funds to Star Wars to a level closer to the $4.5 billion approved
by the Senate in its authorization bill last month.

   A woman who died of a heart attack in jail
before she could be arraigned on a prostitution charge will be
buried in a pauper's grave because Fairfax County authorities could
not identify her.
   The woman left a trail that included 38 aliases, five Social
Security numbers, four claimed dates of birth, and at least 28
arrests for crimes from bank robbery to drug possession over 15
years, according to FBI files.
   ``We will never know who she was,'' said Sheriff M. Wayne
Huggins. ``We worked on it for two weeks, but it became one of
those situations where the more you looked the stranger it got.
   ``It just makes me sad. Sad to look at this life and see what a
tragedy it was,'' Huggins said.
   Her aliases included Catherine Ann Kaine, Katherine Ann Caine _
Candy Caine for short _ when she was arrested Aug. 31 at a motel on
a prostitution charge.
   She died Sept. 5 before her arraignment.
   Police believe she was 34, but was emaciated, worn and looked at
least 50. When the tall blonde was arrested, she had fresh needle
marks on her arms from a drug habit, police said.
   The woman told police she was married, but didn't leave behind
any emergency telephone numbers.
   ``There seemed to be a lot of information there, but we just
couldn't really find anyone who knew a lot about her,'' Huggins
said.
   The woman, who was cremated, will be buried by the county social
services department in potter's field, the Fairfax City Cemetery,
Huggins said.
   During the investigation, one man surfaced who claimed to have
married her in a $10 ceremony in Las Vegas, but investigators
couldn't find any records and allege he was actually in the
prostitution business with her.
   Another man said he was her brother, but authorities doubted
him. That man said she was from Roanoke, but no leads were found
there.
   Huggins last hope was in Chicago, where she was first arrested
for prositution 15 years ago. That was also a futile search.

   Restructuring the nation's
educational system should begin with allowing parents to decide
where to send their children to school, Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos said Wednesday.
   Cavazos, in an interview shortly before the official opening of
the nation's first education summit, said President Bush and other
administration officials would not pressure governors to support
the concept of ``parental choice,'' but would still recommend it.
   ``I don't think that we're going to be selling an idea to these
governors,'' Cavazos said. ``I think what we need to do is put an
idea out and say this is a mechanism that's very, very important.
I've called (choice) the cornerstone for restructuring.''
   While Bush has been a staunch advocate of the idea, making it
the centerpiece of his education initiative, Cavazos initially was
lukewarm. He has since strongly endorsed it.
   Conservatives had hoped the administration would showcase the
idea at the summit and try to get commitments from governors to
support the concept in their states.
   The most controversial form of school choice allows parents to
send their children to schools outside the districts where they
live. So far this year, Arkansas, Iowa and Nebraska have joined
Minnesota in calling for open enrollment options for their citizen.
   Minnesota's open enrollment plan went into effect the past
school year.
   Shortly after the summit, in mid-October, Cavazos is slated to
begin a whirlwind ``choice'' tour that will take him to Minnesota,
North Carolina, Colorado and California. His plans include daytime
hearings and nighttime sessions with working parents.
   ``We're not really selling the program,'' said Cavazos. ``We
simply are taking it out there. People are going to consider it.''
   As with most of the education programs being discussed at the
summit, finding money to implement choice programs may be a problem.
   Cavazos admitted, ``There's no way in the world that we can fund
that kind of program.'' Transportation costs are one of the most
expensive aspects of the concept.

<HEAD>Senators Ask up to $1.1 Billion for Hurricane's Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Carolina's senators said Wednesday they
would try to win congressional approval this week for up to $1.1
billion to aid residents of areas stricken by Hurricane Hugo.
   Sen. Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., said he would seek $400 million for
victims in South Carolina, North Carolina, Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands. Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said he has asked for
$1.1 billion and has the support of Hollings and Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.
   Hollings said the money would be requested as part of a
continuing resolution aimed at keeping the government in business
when the new government fiscal year begins Sunday.
   The House passed such a measure on Tuesday in anticipation of
the Senate being unable to pass all the appropriations bills by the
end of the week. The Senate now has the measure.
   Thurmond spokesman Christopher Simpson said the continuing
resolution was the most likely vehicle for obtaining the money
quickly.
   Thurmond said that the Bush administration supports his request.
   In a related matter, Hollings sharply criticized the Federal
Emergency Management Agency for its response to the Hugo emergency.
   He said he was angered in particular about the failure of FEMA
to order provide emergency generators immediately when Hollings
called acting administrator Robert Morris on Saturday.
   FEMA spokesman Bill McAda said the agency has answered the
state's request for generators, which was made this week. He said
the Red Cross, national guard and state-based authorities make the
first responses and the state governors must request FEMA
intervention.
   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department said it has approved the
emergency release of food to help residents in six South Carolina
counties.
   Deputy Secretary Jack C. Parnell said the food was approved for
Charleston, Berkeley, Sumter, Dorchester and Georgetown counties,
and parts of Orangeburg County.
   Food was issued to families in Dorchester, Sumter and Orangeburg
counties Tuesday, he said. The other three counties may wait for
emergency food stamps rather than take food commodities.
   Parnell said South Carolina's request Tuesday for emergency food
stamps for the hardest hit counties was approved immediately and
that nearly $33 million worth of stamps are being sent for
emergency distribution later this week when retail grocery stores
are operating again.
   South Carolina officials estimated 100,000 households in the
state are in need of emergency food aid.

<HEAD>House Agriculture Chairman Says Farm Bill Will Not Wait For Trade
Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, said Wednesday
that new farm legislation will not be held up so trade negotiations
can proceed ``in Geneva or any other place.''
   In fact, he said, there will be a push for farm bill completion
by next spring, with or without a proposal from the Bush
administration.
   De la Garza, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee,
reacted to recent comments by Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
who has indicated that only minor work might be necessary on
current farm law until substantive progress is made in the Uruguay
Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   The current law, the Food Security Act of 1985, will expire at
the end of next year, and Congress is just getting started on a
1990 bill.
   Much of the nuts and bolts of the legislation will bear directly
or indirectly on GATT trade policies and whether the United States
will be successful in its bid to scale back _ and eventually
eliminate _ trade barriers and subsidies that distort agricultural
trade.
   Yeutter said earlier this week in Minneapolis, Minn., that he
expected only minor changes in the commodity portions of the 1985
farm law and that major modification could come in 1991 after GATT
negotiations are completed.
   De la Garza said it is the responsibility of Congress to
legislate and decide how long a farm law shall be in effect.
   ``The Congress will decide whether or not to accept or reject
any agreement made by the administration in Geneva or any other
place,'' he said in a statement.
   ``We will cooperate to the extent possible with the
administration, but it is my firm intention to continue with our
stated goal of concluding the most extensive set of farm bill
hearings in history by the end of this calendar year,'' de la Garza
added.
   Further, he said, ``it is my intention to begin the markup of a
farm bill early in 1990,'' with or without a proposal by the Bush
administration.
   Yeutter has said he expects the administration will send its
1990 farm bill to Congress by the end of this year.
   De la Garza said it is his intention to have a five-year farm
billl completed and on the president's desk by the end of May.

<HEAD>Americans Will Drive More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE RUMSEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans will drive 4 trillion miles in 2007,
about double the number they drove in 1987, a transportation trade
group executive said Wednesday.
   A growing desire for mobility will account for most of the
growth in traffic, said Francis B. Francois, executive director of
the American Association of Street, Highway and Transportation
Officials.
   ``Americans drove 2 trillion miles in 1987, about triple what
they drove in 1956,'' Francois said. ``This is not the 1950s where
American families had one car which dad may or may not have driven
to work, because he took public transportation.''
   Both government and commuters must accept new ways to pay for
new roads and improvements to existing ones, said Francois and
others at a news conference where they presented findings of a
congestion study sponsored by the Urban Land Institute.
   The institute is a research group supported in part by real
estate developers.
   ``There is the prevailing sentiment in local government to
approach the problem simplistically, like `if you stop development
you will stop traffic growth.' That is clearly not the case,''
northern Virginia developer and study director James DeFrancia said.
   Even with no new real estate development in the suburbs, traffic
would increase, the study argued.
   In norrs has increased twice as fast as population, DeFrancia said.
Nationally, the number of miles driven and the number of cars
increased about 55 percent from 1969 to 1983 and the number of
drivers rose 43 percent while the population increased only 14
percent.
   The institute recommended greater use of public transit and car
pools as well as new financing to reduce road congestion.
   The United States spent about $66 billion on its roads in 1987,
but should be spending at least $80 billion annually just to
maintain old roads and build the most vital new ones, Francois said.
   ``It should be $100 billion to really meet all the needs,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Leahy Fears `James Watt Clone' in New Ag Department Nominee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy said Wednesday ``we don't need a James Watt clone'' as he
opened confirmation hearings on President Bush's nominee for
assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources and the
environment.
   ``I expressed serious reservations when the Bush administration
announced the nomination of Mr. James Cason,'' the Vermont Democrat
said.
   He said he delayed the hearings to give the committee time to
review the questions that had been raised about Cason, who has been
a high-ranking official at the Interior Department since 1982.
   ``Mr. Cason's background and alleged actions while at the
Department of Interior concern me,'' Leahy said.
   He said Cason, 35, has no professional training in forest
land-use stewardship or soil and water conservation, which would be
his responsibilities as assistant agriculture secretary.
   The nominee also has been accused of advocating positions at the
Interior Department that ``reduce the returns to taxpayers from our
federal resources and undermine sound protection of the
environment,'' Leahy said.
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., asked Cason to compare himself to
Watt, the former Interior secretary whose pro-development policies
were considered by environmentalists to be destructive to public
lands.
   Cason said he and Watt worked under the same mandate to provide
public lands for multiple uses, including private and public
interests.
   But, he said, ``I don't know Jim Watt that well.''
   In his opening statement, Leahy said, ``We are at a time when a
strong and heightened awareness of the environment is needed in the
Department of Agriculture _ a spirit of cooperation among all
interests has to prevail.
   ``We do not need a James Watt clone in this position.''
   Cason, whose parents were migrant farm workers, graduated magna
cum laude from Pacific University in Forest Grove, Ore., with a
bachelor's degree in business administration.
   ``His was a world of hard work and hard living,'' said Sen. Mark
Hatfield, R-Ore., in a special appearance before the committee.
   Though his remarks about Cason were laudatory and he admonished
the committee to ``separate fact from fiction'' when reviewing
Cason's record, Hatfield never said explicitly that Cason should be
approved for the agriculture job.
   Cason was employed in real estate and development before joining
the Interior Department as special assistant to the director of the
Bureau Land Management in 1982 when Watt was Interior secretary.
   Since 1985, Cason has been principal deputy assistant secretary
for land and minerals management at Interior.
   Cason's detractors believe that in 1986 he tried to prevent a
report from becoming public that said the spotted owl's existence
could be endangered by the harvesting of old growth forest in the
Pacific northwest.
   Under questioning from Leahy, Cason denied that he tried to hide
the report, saying that changes needed to be made and he was
holding it only until ``it was cleaned up.''
   When asked by Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., if he approved selling
timber from national forests at below market cost, Cason said
factors other than the cost must be considered, such as local
economic concerns and rural development opportunities.

<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PLESETSK SPACE CENTER, USSR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviets ended decades of
secrecy Wednesday by opening the world's busiest spaceport to
foreign journalists and revealing one of the worst disasters of the
space age _ the 1980 explosion of a Vostok rocket during fueling
that killed 50 people.
   Moscow-based correspondents were invited to this military
facility set among birch forests and lakes 530 miles north of the
Soviet capital to observe back-to-back launches of a Soviet Molniya
television satellite and an East Bloc research probe designed to
reveal secrets of the ionosphere.
   The officially sanctioned trip to the spaceport in northwestern
Russia _ whose existence was acknowledged by the Soviets only five
years ago _ was further proof of the increased candor in Soviet
society as well as the space establishment's pursuit of foreign
clients and funds.
   ``This is a time of openness and we have to make everything
known that was hidden before, like how space has been mastered, and
what scientific results are being obtained,'' said Army Lt. Gen.
Ivan I. Oleinik, the space center's commander. Also, he said, ``We
need to learn how to count money.''
   To help their space program yield bigger commercial dividends,
the Soviets are hunting for foreign partners in space. In April,
the first commercial payload was launched at Plesetsk for the
French firm Matra. Last month, a West German consortium's
experiment to grow protein crystals in orbit was launched.
   The growing commercialization and resulting welcome given
foreigners at Plesetsk is something new in the history of the base,
founded in 1957 as a top-secret launch site for Soviet military
missiles that would be relatively near U.S. targets on the other
side of the North Pole.
   Behind the electrified barbed wire fences and armed guards 186
miles south of the White Sea port of Archangelsk lies what East and
West agree is the world's busiest space center.
   In his respected annual report on the Soviet space program,
Nicolas Johnson of Teledyne Brown Engineering said that by 1987,
the number of launches into space from Plesetsk had reached 1,159 _
more than all total U.S., European, Japanese and Chinese space
launches combined.
   Oleinik, interviewed on the launch pad minutes before blast-off
of the four-stage Soyuz booster rocket carrying the Molniya, put
the number of launches at Plesetsk at ``1,000 and some-odd.''
   ``This is the world's hardest-working spaceport,'' the general
added.
   Under the Kremlin's openness policy, stunning revelations have
been made about failures in the Soviet space program, including the
1960 explosion of an ICBM that killed the head of Soviet missile
forces, Field Marshal Mitrofan Nedelin, and 53 others at the famous
Soviet space center Baikonur, home of the country's manned space
program.
   Soviet space specialists, however, say there has been no public
mention of accidents at Plesetsk. But a 30-foot-high rocket-shaped
aluminum monument in the base's bedroom community of Mirny honors
the victims of two apparently previously unreported disasters.
   On March 18, 1980, a Vostok rocket _ the same two-stage booster
used to send Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into orbit in 1961 _
exploded while being fueled on the launch pad. Forty-five people,
mostly Soviet Army inductees in their late teens and early 20s,
were instantly burned to death, said Anatoly Lapshin, senior
scientific collaborator in Plesetsk's commercial department.
   Five other men, who suffered burns over as much as 90 percent of
their bodies, died after being hospitalized, Lapshin said.
   The 45 killed instantly were buried under red granite tombstones
next to the monument near the shore of Lake Plesetsk, and their
enameled portraits were affixed on two low concrete walls. In front
of a row of fir trees, an eternal flame burns in memory of ``the
heroes.''
   Despite 4{ years of the Kremlin's official openness policy,
nothing yet has been written by state media about one of the
biggest tragedies and its victims, Lapshin said.
   The 1980 explosion was not the only catastrophe at Plesetsk,
Lapshin said. On June 23, 1973, a Cosmos booster rocket also
erupted in flames while being fueled, and nine technicians and
soldiers were killed.
   Lapshin said that following the accidents, government
commissions met and enacted safer guidelines for the refueling of
rockets.
   Oveikin said the accidents were ``tragedies,'' but that human
loss in the pursuit of progress was unavoidable.
   ``When the first automobile was tested, there were accidents
too,'' the two-star general said.
   The Molniya satellite, designed to rebroadcast programs from
state Soviet television and provide radio-telephone service to
Siberia and the Soviet Far East, shot skyward with an ear-splitting
roar atop the Soyuz booster.
   Nine minutes after launch, the 47-yard-high rocket powered by
liquid oxygen and kerosene was reported in orbit to journalists
watching from a site nearly two miles from the launch pad.
   Before dawn Thursday, technicians at Plesetsk were scheduled to
launch Intercosmos-24, an East Bloc research satellite.
   The spacecraft will carry a metal coil that will expand into a
ring 20 yards in diameter once the satellite reaches its elliptical
orbit up to 1,500 miles above Earth's surface.
   The ring will be powered by low-frequency radio waves and will
become an antenna stimulating the ionosphere much the way the sun
does.

<HEAD>Olive Branch to be Incorporated in National Peace Gardens</HEAD>

   The olive branch, an ancient symbol of peace,
will be prominently incorporated in the design of the new National
Peace Garden proposed for the nation's capital.
   The plan by Cambridge, Mass., architect Eduardo Catalano,
includes a large, central open space surrounded by a tree-shaped
promenade, said Paul A. Spreiregen, a Washington architect who
served on the selection panel and who also directed the design
competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
   The plan, announced Wednesday, also includes a glass-enclosed
visitor's center and a natural ampitheatre on a 12-acre site at
Hains Point near the Jefferson Memorial.
   ``I see Washington as a city of monuments,'' said Elizabeth M.
Ratcliff, the former Berkeley, Calif., English teacher who
originally proposed the idea. ``We have the great museums that tell
us about our literary and scientific achievements, great houses of
government and monuments which witness the sacrifices that people
have made to keep our country alive.
   ``It just seemed to me that among those symbols should be _
there had to be _ something which said something about the
future,'' she said.
   Catalano's design was among 930 proposals.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Cal., introduced the National Peace
Monument bill in March 1986. Former President Reagan signed the
measure into law in June 1987.
   Of the estimated $6 million cost for the gardens, more than
$300,000 dollars has been raised so far, Ms. Ratcliff said.
   According to the law, the project must be completed by 1992 or
the entire legislative process must be repeated.
   The gardens will be composed of seven large leaf forms, each of
which will be bordered by paved pathways that will enable visitors
to walk from leaf to leaf.
   The curvilinear paths join where the leaves meet each other,
forming the spine of the olive branch. Circular planters will be
placed between the leaves, where their stem forms to create the
main branch.
   The leaf forms will consist of a variety of low ground covers
extending about a foot high, and will ``form a rich, varied and
intricate texture,'' Spreiregen said.

   A month after rocketing from economics
professor to deputy prime minister of Poland, Solidarity activist
Leszek Balcerowicz was holding round-the-clock meetings Wednesday
with Western leaders to find the means for his government's
survival.
   ``We face a great threat, and to reduce the threat we see aid
from foreign nations not as a substitute for our own efforts but as
a condition that could reduce the risk and could ensure a
reasonable degree of success,'' Balcerowicz said during a pause in
his hectic schedule.
   Balcerowicz, 42, the senior Polish leader to visit Washington
since the Solidarity-led government came to power Aug. 24, holds
the twin titles of deputy prime minister and finance minister,
making him the senior Solidarity backer in the cabinet after Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   Mazowiecki heads the first non-Communist government in the
Soviet bloc.
   Balcerowicz may have been chosen not only because of his loyalty
to Solidarity and knowledge of economics, but because of his past
affiliation with the United States.
   He speaks English with an American accent he picked up along
with a masters' degree in business administration from St. John's
University in Queens, New York. He earned a doctorate at the Warsaw
Main School of Planning and Social Statistics, where he taught
until this summer.
   Balcerowicz supported the independent Solidarity trade union
during its 1980-81 legal existence. After the martial law crackdown
against the union Dec. 13, 1981, he quit the Polish United Workers
Party, the Communist party.
   Visiting Washington for a session of the 152-nation
International Monetary Fund, Balcerowicz has met with the finance
ministers of six of the seven major Western industrialized nations,
including U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   Poland wants at least $1.5 billion over the next few months to
ensure a steady supply of essential goods and to stabilize the
faltering Polish currency, he said.
   ``There are no good precedents for what we have to do,''
Balcerowicz said at a news conference.
   ``We had quite numerous and quite productive meetings, at least
in terms of numbers. The atmosphere was warm and I would hope
results would be forthcoming quite quickly.''
   Earlier Wednesday, President Bush told the IMF that ``we must do
more'' to help Poland, urging the international lending
organization and its sister agency the World Bank to help Poland
restructure its economy.
   Balcerowicz said he welcomed both Bush's comments and approval
by the European Economic Community of a $660 million aid package
for Poland and Hungary, which is also moving quickly on the path of
democratic reforms.
   Balcerowicz said he had ``heard about 100 ideas'' for the West
to aid Poland, and that he would welcome the idea of forming Polish
and Western groups to coordinate the aid program.
   ``I would see the need for coordination on the Western side and
we are taking coordinating measures on our side,'' he said.

   Hundreds of East Germans ignored
spreading illness and pouring rain Wednesday as they crowded into
the West German Embassy compound to press their demands to emigrate
to the West.
   ``I leave here only to the West or in a coffin,'' said one woman.
   Newcomers scaled the fence of the embassy garden, and refugees
told reporters that about 1,500 were inside the embassy compound.
   The East German government Tuesday offered them guaranteed
emigration with impunity within six months if they would return
home, but only 177 people accepted the offer.
   The East Germans are hoping they will have the same luck as
hundreds of East Germans who crowded the West German Embassy in
Budapest, Hungary, in hopes of winning permission to leave their
hard-line communist homeland. The refugees had been drawn to
Hungary since May, when the reformist nation began dismantling its
barriers along the western border.
   In West Germany, border officials said more than 500 East
Germans arrived overnight from Hungary via Austria. Since Hungary
decided on Sept. 10 to allow East Germans free passage to the West,
more than 22,000 refugees have arrived in West Germany, where they
are given automatic citizenship.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher arranged to
meet East German Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer at the United
Nations in New York on Wednesday night, with the refugee situation
high on their agenda.
   Genscher told the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday that
reforms in East Germany would open new prospects and encourage
people to stay there.
   Hundreds of beds were made available Wednesday to accommodate
the swelling crowd in the Prague embassy. Conditions were
deteriorating for the East Germans, housed mainly in Red Cross
tents.
   Several of the more than 250 children were said to have fallen
ill with diarrhea and colds following heavy rain that began during
the night. The embassy was dubbed ``Leipziger Hof,'' or hotel, by
the refugees, after the East German city of Leipzig.
   ``We are humans, not animals, aren't we? They cannot let us rot
away here, can they?'' a man told a Western reporter talking to him
through the fence.
   Some refugees said the crowd included many people with criminal
records who were not trying to emigrate for political reasons.
   The Czechoslovak Communist Party newspaper Rude Pravo said
providing the would-be emigrants with food and accommodations was
getting more difficult.
   It said the situation could be resolved only through discussions
between East and West Germany. East Germany has responded harshly
to Hungary's decision to let the East Germans leave.
   The refugees in Prague said they were given three days to accept
the offer by Wolfgang Vogel, an East German lawyer who is acting as
a negotiator for the East German government.
   Vogel left Prague for Warsaw Wednesday to discuss the fate of
about 400 East German refugees in the West German Embassy in the
Polish capital.
   He is expected to meet with Walter Priesnitz and Juergen
Sudhoff, two West German Foreign Ministry officials who negotiated
with Vogel in Prague.
   Vogel is expected to make a similar offer to East German
refugees in Poland as he did to those in Prague.
   Negotiations are ``on the right path'' for resolving the fate of
the East German refugees in Warsaw, Stefan Staniszewski, a
spokesman for the Polish Foreign Ministry, said Wednesday.
   ``Both German countries ... seem to be approaching an agreement
that would take into account the standpoints of the interested
sides, as well as a humane approach to the matter,'' Staniszewski
told a news conference.
   He would not elaborate on the course of the negotiations except
to say, ``The solution of this difficult question is on the right
path.''

   The State Department has approved visa
applications for at least two Palestine Liberation Organization
officials to attend the U.N. General Assembly session in New York,
it was announced Wednesday.
   There had been speculation that the administration might approve
a visa for PLO chairman Yasser Arafat in light of the improved
U.S.-PLO relationship but State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Arafat did not apply.
   Officials declined to say whether U.S. and PLO representatives
had discussed the possibility of a visa request by Arafat. The
State Department has declined comment on how it would respond to a
such a request but congressional sentiment was strongly opposed to
granting Arafat entry.
   One of the visas was for Adb Rabbuh, head of a PLO delegation
that has been holding periodic talks since December in Tunis with
U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau.
   Rabbuh, who attended the General Assembly session last year, is
second in command of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
   The second visa was authorized for Suliman Najab, a member of
the PLO executive committee and of the Palestine Communist Party.
   Boucher indicated that the visa authorizations were a routine
matter.
   ``We've authorized these visas for a number of years, consistent
with our international legal obligations as host country to the
U.N. and following a full legal review of the application,'' he
said.
   Boucher's comments left open the possibility that other PLO
officials may accompany Rabbuh and Najab to New York. The visas
restrict the travel of the PLO representatives to a 25-mile radius
of New York City.
   The visas were issued solely to enable the Palestinians to take
part in U.N.-related activity. They are expected to leave the
United States when the General Assembly adjourns in December.
   On Tuesday, 68 senators urged the Bush administration to deny
any visa request from Arafat, contending that he has not lived up
to promises made in December to renounce terrorism and recognize
Israel's right to exist.
   ``The PLO is on a collision course with the peace process.
Arafat and the PLO must reaffirm and implement, in deed and in
word, the statements of just nine months ago,'' the senators said.
   After Arafat made those statements, the United States abandoned
its opposition to direct talks with PLO officials. Four formal
meetings have been held since then, the last of which was in July.

   The government will not free the final
39 jailed former Somoza national guardsmen until Contra rebels
comply with a Central American peace accord and disband from camps
in Honduras, an official said Wednesday.
   The guardsmen remained jailed after the government freed 1,894
others in March. The government said a special commission of the
Organization of American States recommended the 39, generally
officers of higher rank, not be freed.
   All were arrested in July 1979 after the Sandinistas overthrew
dictator Anastasio Somoza and ended the 42-year Somoza family
dynasty.
   Carlos Nunez, president of the National Assembly, said no
general amnesty was possible in Nicaragua until there were
``concrete, clear signals'' from the insurgents that they would
comply with the peace agreement by demobilizing and relocating from
Honduran camps to Nicaragua or third countries by Dec. 8.
   In exchange for disbanding of the U.S.-backed rebels, Nicaragua
agreed to make democratic reforms, including more freedom for the
opposition leading up to February 1990 elections. Ortega and four
other Central American presidents signed the agreement Aug. 7 in
Tela, Honduras.
   Meanwhile the assembly on Wednesday approved a pardon for 457
civilian prisoners who had been jailed for violations of security
laws. It included more than 200 prisoners who were released by
President Daniel Ortega a month ago in the northern part of the
country.

   Teacher unions were not invited to
the two-day education summit that opened Wednesday between
President Bush and the nation's governors. In fact, no education
groups were.
   But leaders and staff of the National Education Association and
the American Federation of Teachers were nonetheless very much in
evidence here, determined to play a behind-the-scenes role at the
historic gathering that could determine the future directionn of
school reform.
   Keith Geiger, president of the 2 million-member NEA, spent
Wednesday meeting with Govs. Booth Gardner of Washington, James
Blanchard of Michigan and Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico, pressing
the union's agenda that includes increased funding for federal
programs. Geiger said he planned to meet with about 10 governors
before the meeting adjourned Thursday.
   Albert Shanker, president of the 710,000-member AFT, said he
planned to arrive at the summit Thursday with about 10 other union
officials.
   ``Essentially we're going in order to be in a central position
to comment,'' said Shanker, reached by telephone in Washington.
   Both Shanker and Geiger denied any anger or bitterness at not
being invited.
   ``When the education summit was first discussed, we wondered how
in the world you could have it without groups like the NEA and
other educational organizations. But it's now a moot point. Had it
been opened up to a select group of organizations, and if we
weren't among them, then we'd have been upset,'' Geiger said.
   ``But as it turned out, the summit consists of a very defined
group of people. On that basis, we're comfortable,'' he said.
   ``I was invited to the White House before the summit, and we
spent considerable time talking with governors,'' said Shanker, who
added that he took no offense at not being invited to the summit.
   ``It's a big country,'' he said. ``There are 16,000 school
boards and many other constituencies. You have to draw the line
somewhere.''
   The three top officers of the NEA and six staff members were on
the scene, many of them in the press area in the University of
Virginia gymnasium. ``With somewhere around 1,000 reporters here,
we wanted them to have the NEA's perspective,'' Geiger said.

   Consumer advocates and insurers who have
clashed in the past joined forces Wednesday to push for legislation
such as mandated autosafety features and a return to the 55 mph
speed limit on all interstate highways.
   The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety will pursue ``a
balanced and aggressive approach'' to reduce highway deaths and
injuries and the high cost of automibile accidents, said executive
director Judith Lee Stone.
   Insurers hope improved auto safety will help stem rising auto
insurance costs, said Gerald L. Maatman, president of Kemper
National Property and Casualty Cos., one of several major insurance
firms joining the coalition.
   Researchers say auto accidents kill 48,000 Americans a year and
cost an estimated $74 billion.
   In the past, the insurance industry has come under fire from
consumer advocate groups over the cost of premiums.
   Maatman said reform movements like one in California, where
voters passed a referendum mandating reduced rates, helped prompt
the industry to join the coalition. The referendum was promoted by
consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
   ``There's no doubt (the California referendum) has heightened in
the minds of our industry the fact that the public is now expecting
an increased amount of effort in participation on problems,''
Maatman said.
   In a telephone interview, Nader said the insurance industry had
taken a first step toward fulfilling ``its neglected responsibility
in loss prevention.''
   Nader said that without the California referendum, insurance
companies ``never would have done this.''
   Insurance companies and groups representing 40 percent of the
American automobile insurance market have pledged $1.5 million for
the organization's efforts in the first year, Stone said.
   At the federal leval, the group backs a Senate bill to extend
current auto safety features to trucks and vans. It also adds
features to protect against impact from side collisions and require
motorcycle helmet usage, anti-lock brakes and passenger side air
bags.
   The group also wants a return to the 55 mph speed limit on all
interstate highways. In 1987, Congress allowed states to raise the
speed limit to 65 mph on rural stretches of interstates.
   At the state and local level, the group plans to push issues
such as drunken driving, safety belts and child seats.
   Insurance discounts for using safety devices are not among the
group's priorities.
   ``We will work hard to make this marriage work and we'll worry
about whether we have any children later,'' Maatman said of
divisive issues that might come up later.
   Consumer advocate groups that will be part of the coalition
include Public Citizen, a Nader-founded group. In addition, safety
and medical experts will also be on the group.

<TEXT>
   Joao Soares, the son of
Portugal's president, was seriously injured in a plane crash near a
guerrilla base in southeastern Angola, officials said Wednesday.
   The four other people in the plane, including two members of the
Portuguese Parliament, suffered less severe injuries, officials
said. All five were flown to South Africa and admitted to a
hospital in Pretoria.
   The accident occurred Tuesday night when one of the engines on a
small Cessna aircraft failed during takeoff from the airstrip at
Jamba, headquarters for the rebels of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), officials said.
   Soares, a Socialist Party member of Parliament and son of
President Mario Soares, and fellow parlimentarians Jose Nogueira de
Brito and Rui Gomes da Silva were being treated at H.F. Verwoerd
Hospital in Pretoria, said Joao Camara, secretary of the Portuguese
Embassy in South Africa.
   Rainer Geppelt, a German journalist, and pilot Joaquim Agusto,
also were hurt, according to a statement from South African Foreign
Minister Pik Botha.
   Botha described Joao Soares' injuries as serious, saying he had
suffered head and lung injuries, extensive internal bleeding, a
broken jaw and fractured pelvis.
   Botha said a commercial aircraft was sent from South Africa to
pick up the injured people after the intervention of President
Soares.
   South Africa says it stopped military assistance to the Angolan
rebels as part of a regional peace accord signed last December that
also calls for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban soldiers from Angola.
   Journalists and government officials from numerous countries
continue to visit the rebel headquarters on planes departing from
South Africa.
   President Soares was to leave as planned for Budapest, Hungary,
on an official visit, officials in Lisbon said. However, his wife
Maria Barroso, decided not to join him so she could visit her
injured son Thursday in South Africa, officials added.
   Portugal ruled Angola until 1975, when the colony gained
independence under the leadership of the Marxist government.

<HEAD>1000s Protest; Johannesburg Ends Segregation in Public Places</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST LONDON, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of protesters
demanding ``justice, peace and freedom'' marched Wednesday through
an East London seaside resort in what probably was South Africa's
largest legal demonstration.
   In Johannesburg, the city council voted to desegregate buses,
swimming pools and recreation centers.
   The decision to integrate all public facilities controlled by
the city, South Africa's largest, counters wishes of most white
voters who in a poll earlier this year approved desegregating buses
and recreation centers but opposed opening ``whites-only'' pools to
blacks.
   Among those marching in East London was the white managing
director of the city's Mercedes-Benz car manufacturing plant and
many of the company's black employees, who were given the day off
to take part.
   Police estimated the crowd at 25,000 to 40,000.
   The largest previous government-approved rally was a march in
downtown Cape Town two weeks ago by 20,000 to 25,000 people.
   There have been mass demonstrations across the country since
President F.W. de Klerk announced Sept. 13 that authorities would
not break up lawful, peaceful protests.
   The East London rally for ``justice, peace and freedom'' was led
by David Russell, the Anglican archbishop of Grahamstown, along
with other local clerics and human rights lawyers.
   Protesters clogged the downtown area and most shops closed for
the day. Marchers danced, chanted and sang freedom songs, and some
carried the green, gold and black flag of the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Rally leaders marched to the headquarters of the security police
and presented written demands for the release of political
prisoners, legalization of banned opposition groups and lifting of
the 3-year-old state of emergency.
   There was a heavy police presence, including armored vehicles
and a helicopter. But officers stood aside and no incidents were
reported.
   All the approved rallies in the past two weeks have been
peaceful except for some minor looting at a march last week in
southeastern Pietermaritzburg. In Pretoria, police used clubs
Saturday to disperse some women trying to proceed with a protest
march that was not authorized.
   Wednesday's rally was part of a nationwide protest campaign
launched Aug. 2 targeting segregated schools, hospitals, beaches,
buses and other facilities.
   In Johannesburg, white students at Rand Afrikaans University
jeered 200 black students who marched Wednesday to protest
segregated dormitories. About 75 percent of students at the
overwhelmingly white university voted last week to maintain
segregated residences, the black students said.
   The Johannesburg City Council vote does not affect schools,
neighborhoods or hospitals that are segregated by national and
provincial laws. Also, private facilities may be segregated under
the Separate Amenities
   The council voted Tuesday night amid strong opposition from
members of the far-right Conservative Party.
   In a poll earlier this year, white Johannesburg voters favored
desegregating buses and recreation centers, but 60 percent voted
not to swim with blacks.
   ``We are taking a large step in South African terms,'' said
council member Harold Rudolph. ``I am so glad we are putting right
that which was wrong.''
   Most public facilities in major cities have been desegregated in
recent years, either informally or by repealing legislation. Cape
Town already has formally repealed racist laws.
   Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town are considered the most
liberal cities in the country. Towns just outside Johannesburg,
such as Boksburg, have been re-imposing rigid apartheid since the
Conservative Party won control of some local councils in municipal
elections a year ago.
   The Johannesburg council is controlled by President F.W. de
Klerk's National Party.

   Among the teachers he saluted he numbered six members of his
Cabinet, 13 governors and even his wife Barbara. While she ``has
never held a teaching position,'' he included her, he said, because
she's been ``a leader in the fight against illiteracy.''
   ``I toast those who have heard the call and followed it _ those
who have sacrificed so much in order that America might enjoy a
sure foundation of freedom and happiness,'' Bush said.
   ``I toast our teachers _ those who taught us, and teach our
children, and those among us who have been members of this proud
profession.
   ``We have come to the home of Thomas Jefferson to build upon his
dream of a strong system of education for all. But without our
teachers _ without their vision and their dedication _ the dream
would be lost. I ask you to join me in saluting the teachers of
America.''

   Oliver L. North, performing community service
in a Washington area drug program as part of his Iran-Contra
sentence, says Americans must help in the war on drugs because
``just saying `No' hasn't worked.''
   The former National Security Council aide, who is appealing his
conviction in federal court on charges arising from the Iran-Contra
affair, writes about his drug work in the Fall issue of Fairfax
Magazine, published in suburban Fairfax, Va.
   North, who lives in Fairfax County, wrote the article at the
request of the magazine's publisher, Phil Hough, who was his
classmate at the Naval Academy in Annapolis and one of the founders
of a fund to help pay his legal and security bills.
   North was sentenced to two years probation and fined $150,000
after his conviction. He was also ordered to perform 1,200 hours of
community service. Although he is appealing the conviction, he has
begun the community service, working with a Washington-based
organization called the Alliance to Save America's Future.
   He said the program ``is based on the recognitation that just
saying `No' hasn't worked - that the choice being made by too many
of our region's young people is influenced in the wrong direction
by the glamor of too many role models who deal in or use drugs inWritethru,

<TEXT>
   The No. 3 executive at CBS said Wednesday he
will investigate claims that the ``CBS Evening News'' in the
mid-1980s aired fake combat footage and false news reports of the
war in Afghanistan.
   The New York Post reported Wednesday that most of the questioned
footage was shot by Mike Hoover, 45, a free-lancer who covered the
war on a story-by-story basis for CBS and won an Oscar in 1985 for
a short live-action film called ``Up.''
   ``I'm going to have to look into it,'' CBS Broadcast Group
President Howard Stringer, a former CBS News president, said of the
claims in the Post, which cited ``military and media sources'' in
the United States, Europe and Asia.
   The Post, quoting an Afghan rebel who it said served as Hoover's
translator, reported that Hoover staged scenes of guerrilla
sabotage. The paper also quoted a defense consultant as saying the
cameraman passed off pictures of a Chinese-made Pakistani jet
fighter on a training mission as a Soviet-made jet bombing Afghan
villages in 1986.
   Stringer was executive producer of anchorman Dan Rather's ``CBS
Evening News'' but left it in January 1984, 10 months before the
disputed footage aired in two reports. The reports won the
broadcast a prestigious Columbia-du Pont Silver Baton award.
   In the broadcasts, film shot by Hoover showed Mujahedeen rebels
reportedly blowing up pylons to cut power to the Afghan capital of
Kabul during the war that began in 1979.
   The actual sabotage, the Post said, occurred 12 days before
Hoover arrived on the scene.
   A rebel serving as Hoover's translator told the newspaper that
Hoover persuaded rebel leaders to order about a dozen of their
troops back to the site so he could stage the explosions, according
to the newspaper, identifying the translator only as Etabari.
   ``We can't respond to the story until we talk to the free-lance
cameraman involved,'' said CBS spokesman Tom Goodman.
   Hoover was unavailable for comment. A woman who the Post said
identified herself as his wife said he was working in remote caves
in New Zealand and couldn't be contacted.
   ``It is the goal of CBS in every instance to gather and report
the news accurately, fairly and with integrity. In the case of the
Afghan war, we believe we have done so,'' CBS News president David
Burke said in a statement.
   Rather did not immediately return calls.
   Stringer declined to comment on the Post story, saying he hadn't
read it. ``I don't know who the people involved are or who the
accusations are coming from,'' he said.
   In a 1987 Los Angeles Times interview, Hoover explained that he
proposed coverage of the Afghan war on a story-by-story basis and
never was turned down. He said Rather was ``really the muscle''
behind his CBS assignments.
   The Denver-born Hoover also said in the interview he didn't
regard himself as a news cameraman in the traditional sense. ``I'm
really kind of a filmmaker,'' he said.
   Perry Wolff, executive producer of a ``CBS Reports'' documentary
in 1987 _ an Emmy-winner called ``The Battle For Afghanistan'' that
used some of the questioned footage _ did not return phone calls.
Rather narrated that documentary.
   This summer, a CBS source said, Wolff was suspended by CBS News
after the disclosure that a July special on man's first walk on the
moon identified footage taken in 1972 as having occurred during the
first moon walk in 1969.
   Wolff called it ``an honest mistake'' and blamed a mislabeled
tape. Both he and CBS News spokesmen have refused to confirm or
deny that he was suspended.
   The Post also quoted H. Joachim Maitre, dean of Boston
University's College of Communications, as saying CBS News in 1987
bought footage stolen from Mohamed Salam, an Afghan journalism
student at the school.
   The Post said Rather, on a ``CBS Evening News'' broadcast, later
showed the footage and described it as a ``the biggest one-day
defeat for Soviet forces since World War II,'' when in fact,
according to Maitre, there'd been no such battle.
   What the tape actually showed, Maitre said, was a small,
successful rebel attack against Afghan government troops. He said
he asked for and got an apology from CBS.
   Maitre, an East German defector known for conservative political
views, was not available for comment, his office said. A secretary
there said he was at an all-day conference on defense journalism in
Washington.

   Shots were fired and bottles hurled as
supporters of two rival political factions battled in Windhoek's
black townwship Wednesday. Hospital officials said 20 people were
injured.
   The fracas began as the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance drove a
United Nations-monitored motorcade through a neighborhood that
supports the guerrilla-backed South-West Africa People's
Organization, called SWAPO.
   Residents of the neighborhood accused alliance supporters of
stoning houses that flew SWAPO flags.
   One rock struck the head of a 2-year-old boy standing in the
doorway of his home, said residents. He was hospitalized in serious
condition, they said.
   A 20-year-old man was hospitalized with multiple cuts on his
head, and 15 to 20 other people were treated for cuts and bruises,
hospital officials said.
   No arrests were reported.
   The United Nations is monitoring the campaign leading to
independence elections Nov. 7-11. Observers were present when the
violence began, but their job was to monitor the police, said U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard.
   U.N. Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari has requested a
meeting with territorial administrator Louis Pienaar to discuss
``how law enforcement authorities came to allow such a situation to
arise,'' Eckhard said.
   The South-West Africa People's Organization, whose guerrilla
wing fought a largely unsuccessful 23-year war against South
African rule of the territory, is favored to win most votes in the
election. Its chief opponent is the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance,
a multiracial party that participated in a transitional government
backed by South Africa.

   The Slovenian parli
the federal parliament earlier Wednesday asked Slovenia to postpone
adoption of the changes.
   Western-style democracy is generally opposed in Yugoslavia's
other regions.
   Commenting on the vote, Joze Smole, head of the Slovenian
Socialist Alliance, a communist-led umbrella organization, told the
AP that ``we must now calm the passions aroused by this in
Yugoslavia.''
   ``It is a gross lie that Slovenia wishes to withdraw from
Yugoslavia,'' Smole said, dismissing protests against the changes
as ``irrational acts.''
   Authorities in Slovenia have never actually proposed that the
republic withdraw from the Yugoslav federation.
   Slovenia's 2 million inhabitants make up 8 percent of
Yugoslavia's population and speak a different language from the
Serbo-Croat used by three-quarters of the federation's inhabitants.
   They have traditionally safeguarded their autonomy since the
region was incorporated into Yugoslavia in 1918.
   The leadership of Serbia, Slovenia's main political foe,
advocates strengthening the role of the loose federation by
granting greater powers to the federal government, limiting local
autonomy.
   Serbian lawmakers repeatedly charged that the amendments would
open the door to the eventual breakup of the Yugoslav federation.
   Federal authorities, including the country's 8-member
presidency, repeatedly demanded that some proposed amendments be
dropped because they ``conflict with the federal constitution.''
   The armed forces came out openly Wednesday in support of the
Serbian position in the longstanding political feud between
liberals and conservatives.
   ``The consequences which could arise from these amendments are
extremely serious, and we must warn the (Slovenian) authorities
about this,'' said Adm. Stane Brovet, a Central Committee member.
   But Milan Kucan, head of the Slovenian party, told the session,
``Slovenian communists will choose (to defend) the interests of the
Slovenian people rather than become quislings.''

<HEAD>Angolan Guerrillas Propose Peace Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas
Savimbi has proposed a five-point peace plan calling for an African
force to supervise a truce in his country's 15-year civil war,
according to reports Wednesday from London and Portugal.
   Savimbi's plan, outlined to a congress of his National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola at his bush headquarters in Jamba,
southeastern Angola, was reported by the British Broadcasting Corp.
in London and Correio da Manha, a Portuguese newspaper in Lisbon.
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas are proposing direct talks with the
Marxist government that won power shortly after independence from
Portugal in 1975; a cease-fire and release of all political
prisoners; a transitional government of national unity; immediate
re-writing of the constitution; and free and fair elections.
   According to the reports, the plan calls for a monitoring force
from several African nations to supervise the cease-fire three
months after it begins, formation of a transitional government
within nine months and, six months later, elections supervised by
the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.
   A June 24 cease-fire mediated by Zaire's President Mobutu Sese
Seko quickly broke down, with each side blaming the other.
   Efforts to bring them together for new talks have failed. Last
month, eight African leaders endorsed the Angolan government's
peace plan, which calls for Savimbi to be exiled from the country
during a transitional period and for his forces to be absorbed into
the present government.
   Savimbi says he will not consider leaving the country and that
his forces have not been defeated and would not accept integration
into the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, led
by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   South Africa provided military aid to the guerrillas during much
of the civil war, but agreed to halt that assistance as part of a
regional peace plan that includes the withdrawal of the 50,000
Cuban troops in Angola.
   The United States continues to aid the guerrilla movement, and
the Soviet Union still supports dos Santos' government.
   The State Department has supported Savimbi's insistence that
elections be held in Angola.
   His movement never has had a chance to test its popularity at
the polls. The Portuguese colonizers hastily withdrew from the
country in 1975, leaving three rival factions to fight for power.
Dos Santos' group won.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, opening a
round of talks with Mideast leaders, Wednesday offered assurances
to Israel of full U.S. support for its proposal for Palestinian
negotiations.
   Baker met for 45 minutes with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens. Afterward, Arens and a senior U.S. official said Baker had
not asked Israel to adopt a formula for negotiations sponsored by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   ``We have wholehearted American acceptance of the Israeli peace
initiative and nothing has changed on that,'' Arens told reporters.
   ``There is no alternate initiative to ours. There is only one
peace initiative on the table and it is the one that was formulated
by Mr. Shamir,'' he said.
   ``We didn't discuss any new formula,'' the foreign minister said.
   Mubarak's 10-point formula includes at least two elements
rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir _ that
negotiations should be based on an Israeli commitment to yield
territory for peace and should include Palestinians from outside
the West Bank and Gaza as participants in the talks.
   Two prominent Labor Party members of the Israeli Cabinet, Deputy
Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin,
have approved of Mubarak's approach.
   But Labor is in the minority in the coalition government. Shamir
and Arens are from the dominant Likud coalition.
   A senior U.S. official said Baker had told Arens that he did not
view Mubarak's 10 points as a proposal or as a plan.
   ``We are not asking them (the Israelis) to accept the 10
points,'' this official said at a briefing for reporters conducted
under ground rules that prohibit identification.
   ``The 10 points are not a basis for negotiations,'' describing
them instead as a ``vehicle for a dialogue.
   Baker will continue the discussions at a three-way meeting on
Thursday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmet Abdul-Meguid and
Arens.
   On Friday, Arens meets with Mubarak, who is in New York to
address the special session of the U.N. General Assembly.
   Next Wednesday, the principal members of the Israeli Cabinet
will meet for a formal decision on the Egyptian leader's formula.
   Shamir's proposal is to hold elections among the 1.4 million
Palestinian Arabs who live on the West Bank and Gaza to chose
negotiatiors.
   They would work out a five-year program of local self-rule with
Israel. This would be followed by negotiations on an overall
settement with Egypt and Jordan as well.
   Egypt formerly controlled the Gaza Strip and Jordan the West
Bank. Israel conquered the territories in a 1967 war against many
of the country's Arab neighbors.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gay rights group offered $100 Wednesday to the
first person who refuses to participate in a federal door-to-door
AIDS survey, contending it is a waste of time.
   The survey of 3,400 Dallas County residents begins Saturday. If
officials of a research group hired to conduct the survey are
satisfied with the sampling, they will canvass about 50,000 homes
nationwide.
   William Waybourn, president of the Dallas Gay Alliance, said his
group will pay $100 for the first uncompleted survey form brought
to its headquarters.
   ``Thereafter, for each one not completed and brought to us, we
will contribute $50 to AIDS research,'' he said. ``We challenge the
county, for every one they get completed, to donate the same amount
to research.''
   The government is paying survey participants $50 each.
   The organization and other activists piled 90 dummies on the
steps of the Dallas County Health Department on Tuesday to
represent the estimated number of AIDS deaths here during the
survey period of three to four months. Thousands more would perish
over the span of a three-year national study, activists claim.
   ``The Dallas survey is a pilot project to determine the
feasibility of another study that could cost up to $32 million,''
said Waybourn. ``If the federal government can put its AIDS
treatment efforts on hold for three years, the government can save
money but thousands more will die.''
   One health official said it would be imprudent for opponents to
sabotage the survey.
   ``That just reflects a lack of appreciation on what is going on
in AIDS treatment and research. Tremendous sums are being spent on
them. Millions are spent on AIDS care,'' said Dr. Gordon Green,
director of the Dallas County Health Department.
   Dallas County was chosen for the experimental survey because of
the high number of people suspected of being exposed to the AIDS
virus _ between 15,000 and 30,000. The county's population also
includes a favorable variety of ethnic and social groups, health
officials said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by the HIV, or
human immunodeficiency virus. The virus damages the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and
cancer.
   The National Household Seroprevalence Survey would be the first
to track the virus through the general population, said Donald L.
Zimmerman, the Research Triangle Institute's director of outreach
programs in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
   The nonprofit research agency has been hired to conduct the
survey for the federal government. Zimmerman said he didn't think
the survey, which got an 85 percent response rate during a trial in
Pennsylvania's Allegheny County, would be hurt by opponents'
efforts.
   ``I don't think the opposition ... reflects accurately the
opinion of the gay community,'' Zimmerman said. ``In this survey,
it doesn't matter whether someone's gay or not. Likewise, the virus
doesn't care whether you are gay or not.''
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which last
month approved the anonymous survey of Dallas County residents,
sent letters Tuesday to selected households.
   Survey teams will ask one adult in each of the randomly chosen
households to take a blood test for the AIDS virus and answer
questions about sexual habits and drug use.
   A Dallas Gay Alliance official, John Thomas, said the
organization doesn't have the money in hand to donate $50 to
research for all 3,400 surveys, but he said the group's 700 members
will raise it or contribute themselves.

   Congressional negotiators wrestled Wednesday
with whether the government should finance exhibitions of art some
peoplem consider obscene, reaching no solution but revealing clues
about the direction they are headed.
   House and Senate bargainers planned to resume their efforts on
Thursday to find a compromise to a measure proposed by Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., and passed by the Senate, barring federal subsidies
for ``obscene or indecent material,'' or works that offend members
of any race, religion or sex.
   Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., an opponent of the Helms provision,
said he was considering offering guidelines, similar to Supreme
Court rulings, permitting federal aid to art that attained certain
artistic, scholarly or other standards.
   Yates, long a supporter of federal backing of the arts, has said
the so-called Helms amendment is little short of government
censorship.
   ``We don't want to hamstring the National Endowment for the
Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities and every museum in
the country,'' he said.
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, a conservative who said he supports
the thrust of Helms' language, said he believed a study of the
endowment's grant-making procedures was needed. He also said
legislation was needed stating ``what current congressional
attitudes are'' about offensive art.
   ``Somebody made a mistake,'' McClure said during the
negotiations. ``Somebody should have stopped those materials from
being a taxpayer-financed show.''
   Helms, who is not a negotiator on the fate of his own amendment,
told a reporter that he believed the bargainers would gut his
proposal, and indicated he might force the full Senate to vote on
whether to drop any compromise that emerges in favor of his
original provision.
   ``I'm not going to back up one inch,'' he said. ``They may have
to vote on it three or four times before we're through.''
   Two grants made by the National Endowment for the Arts in the
past year prompted Helms' provision.
   One of the controversial grants supported an exhibit that
included a photograph by Andres Serrano of a Christ figure
submerged in a jar of urine. The other included Robert Mapplethorpe
photographs depicting homosexual acts and the genitalia of children.
   Helms' provision is part of the $10.9 billion Senate version of
a bill making appropriations for Interior Department and certain
other programs, including arts programs.
   The $11.5 billion House version includes a symbolic $45,000 cut,
sponsored by Yates, in the $171 million appropriation for the
National Endowment for the Arts. The two grants at issue came to
$45,000.
   Yates is chairman of the House Appropriations interior
subcommittee and leads the House members of the conference
committee handling the question.
   The Senate adopted the Helms amendment with almost no debate on
a July 26 voice vote.
   Helms and other conservatives have argued that the government
has no business backing works of art that are ffensive to most
people.
   Some arts groups, civil libertarians and others have said the
measure represents unconstitutional censorship, although many have
conceded that the endowment's use of the money seemed of
questionable taste.
   The Helms amendment prohibits federal aid for ``obscene or
indecent materials,'' including ``depictions of sadomasochism,
homo-eroticism, the exploitation of children or individuals engaged
in sex acts.''
   It forbids tax money to be spent on art that ``denigrates''
people based on their religion, race, sex, handicap, age or ethnic
origin.
   It also bans for five years any federal assistance to the
Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C.,
which showed the Serrano work, and the Institute of Contemporary
Art at the University of Pennsylvania, which hosted the
Mapplethorpe exhibit.
   On Sept. 13, the House rejected 264-153 an attempt by
conservatives to accept the Helms amendment.

   A draft law dubbed ``the journalist's dream'' for
its ban on censorship and secretive government has won support from
a working group of three legislative committees, Moscow News
reported Wednesday.
   The bill includes a section ordering government organizations to
answer questions from the press. They may refuse only on the
grounds of state or other legal secrets, and reporters may appeal
to the courts, the newspaper said.
   The measure supplanted a more restrictive version offered by the
Kremlin, Moscow News said. The progressive paper called it ``the
journalist's dream'' because it would let them ``serve the
interests of society and its citizens without taking into account
the bureaucratic view of the world.''
   Already, the title has been changed from the ``Law on the
Press'' to the ``Law on Freedom of the Press,'' the newspaper said.
It has been approved by a working group of the three legislative
committees on law, on glasnost, and on science, education and
culture.
   Although the draft says that ``censorship of the mass media is
not permitted,'' its authors clearly have a realistic view of
imposing such a drastic change on the Soviet Union. Censorship has
considerably eased under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but
official publications still must bear the censor's approval stamp
before they can be printed.
   Moscow News said the bill would allow only the prosecutor to
hold up publication. A court would have to rule within 72 hours
whether the edition will be fully distributed, confiscated, or
delayed for a specified time, it said.
   The draft specifically permits the media to print the name and
rank of any person who succeeds in halting publication of an item,
it said.
   Libel law is simple: if a publication does not have evidence to
support its charges, it must print a correction.
   The Supreme Soviet's committee on legislation, legality and the
rule of law will consider the bill Thursday, the official news
agency Tass said.
   Certain bureaucrats dislide the draft, the paper said, including
an unidentified representative of the State Publishing Committee.
He was quoted as telling a legislative hearing that the section
allowing virtually any legal organization or citizen to start a
newspaper would permit the CIA to buy up all the newsprint in the
country for publications it supports.
   Paper is in short supply here.
   In other legislative committees Wednesday, Deputy Fyodor
Burlatsky, a leader in the official organization involved in
winning the release of hundreds of political prisoners, charged
that Moscow is lagging on its promises to pass human rights
guarantees, Tass reported.
   ``It is necessary to overcome the stereotypes and thought
patterns remaining from the past, and clear a road to new thinking
in this area,'' Burlatsky was quoted as saying.
   He said the proposed law on emigration has serious drawbacks and
a law on human rights has been delayed, Tass reported.
   Tass said other deputies asked further cuts in the military
budget than the proposed 8 percent; for a wage freeze for
bureaucrats, and for public sale of apartments, garden plots and
building lots for summer cottages. Private land ownership is now
banned under Soviet law.

   Soviet cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev landed in Mars
Wednesday and was greeted by hundreds of young star-struck Martians
waving crayon drawings and homemade Soviet and American flags.
   ``Welckim To Mars,'' one first-grader wrote on a note
accompanying a rocket ship made of purple construction paper.
   Krikalev, 31, a flight engineer who lives near Moscow, visited
367 kindergarten through second-grade students at the Mars Primary
Center. He was joined later Wednesday by U.S. astronaut Mario Runco
Jr., 37, a Navy lieutenant commander awaiting assignment to his
first shuttle mission.
   ``Hopefully this is one small step, if you will, for some future
cooperation'' between the two nations, Runko told reporters after
he gave the school 485 NASA photographs.
   The Soviet spaceman said he was touched by the students' gifts,
which included letters, T-shirts, fresh-cut flowers, Russian tea
cakes and crayon and watercolor renderings of their vision of outer
space.
   ``It's not so much the gifts. It's the friendliness that went
behind the gifts. It's coming from the insides of the people who
gave the gifts,'' he said.
   Krikalev passed out photographs showing himself and his two
partners during a five-month French-Soviet Soyuz mission that ended
in April.
   The cosmonaut, in Mars for an eight-day visit, and Runko were
invited to this small community 25 miles north of Pittsburgh by the
Mars Area Foundation for Educational Excellence. Both men also
visited the community's Adams Intermediate Elementary School for
grades two through five.
   Each man put on a rubber boot and stepped into a tray of brown
clay, then signed his name in the clay. The footprints and
signatures were sealed in glass and marked with a plaque noting
that both men ``stepped on Mars, Sept. 27, 1989.''
   ``The goal was to bring unusual cultural programs to the school
district, and it has blossomed beyond anything I had imagined,''
said Ralph Terrell, foundation chairman.
   ``What I really want to promote is for the kids to study hard,
and in the future to get along with the other country,'' Krikalev
said through an interpreter.
   Krikalev fielded questions from the students during a morning
assembly, then visited classrooms. One student asked whether he
worries about accidents like the explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger.
   ``No. We all have our jobs to do,'' said Krikalev, whose gray
suit sported a lapel pin depicting the U.S. and Soviet flags.
   Other students asked what it's like to sleep, eat and float in
space.
   ``I answer the same questions from our children,'' he said with
a smile.
   The school's hallways were decorated with the children's space
drawings. A flying saucer, 10 feet in diameter and made of steel
barrel lids, adorned the town center.
   Krikalev said his Soviet friends were surprised to hear of a
town named Mars, and an American acquaintance in Moscow had never
heard of it.
   ``I couldn't find Mars on the map,'' he said. ``I didn't know
what kind of clothes to bring, because I didn't know where it was.''
   The teachers and the children's parents seemed almost as excited
as the children by the visit.
   ``It's almost like putting Mars on the map. This Mars, not the
planet,'' said Minette Thompson, a fifth-grade teacher.

   USAir and federal investigators Wednesday
dismissed a report the pilots of a jetliner that skidded into the
East River last week had been drinking for five hours before
getting into the cockpit.
   Meanwhile, investigators said a device that holds the rudder
steady for the pilot during takeoff was wrongly set in the full
left position, which could account for the drift the pilot reported
led him to abort the takeoff.
   ``That would tend to want to move the plane to the left if he
didn't do other things to compensate for it,'' said Ted
Lopatkiewicz, a National Transportation Safety Board spokesman in
Washington.
   Peter Baron, who heads the National Center for Air Traffic
Safety, a consumer advocacy group, said the rudder trim ``clearly
could have been one of the factors that led to the crash.'' He said
it would not have become apparent until the plane had built up
speed during takeoff.
   Responding to the drinking report, USAir spokesman David Shipley
in Arlington, Va., said the cockpit crew had only about two hours
between the time they arrived at LaGuardia Airport on Sept. 20 and
the time they reported to the gate for the ill-fated flight.
   ``That's documented,'' he said.
   In addition, the NTSB said the co-pilot was on the plane for
most if not all of that time, while the captain went to USAir
offices at LaGuardia.
   Two passengers were killed after the Boeing 737-400 aborted
takeoff and skidded into the water.
   Federal Aviation Administration regulations prohibit drinking up
to eight hours before a flight.
   Drug and alcohol tests on the pilot and co-pilot came out
negative, but the urine samples were taken 48 hours after the
accident, making them virtually useless for alcohol testing.
   The New York Post reported Wednesday that a detective close to
the investigation said the crew may have spent as many as five
hours in bars near the airport.
   It said that a passenger, Ken Trendel, the husband of a USAir
employee, told authorities immediately after the crash he had been
out ``bouncing'' with the captain and the co-pilot. Investigators
said they believed he meant ``drinking'' or ``bar hopping.''
   Trendel said he, the two pilots and a fourth man had been at a
bar in the nearby Marriott Hotel between 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on
Sept. 20. The plane crashed at 11:29 p.m.
   The NTSB has turned up no suggestion that the pilots were
drinking, Lopatkiewicz said. ``No one has volunteered that kind of
information,'' he said.
   In addition, Shipley said Capt. Michael W. Martin and co-pilot
Constantine Kleissas did not arrive at LaGuardia until 8:40 p.m.
They flew in from Baltimore.
   They were then assigned to Flight 5050, which was scheduled to
depart at 10:30 p.m. The plane left the gate at 10:52 p.m. and was
held on the ground until about 11:20 p.m., Lopatkiewicz said.
   ``The New York Post story and this other gentleman's allegations
just don't jibe with the facts,'' Shipley said.
   Lopatkiewicz said Kleissas ``basically stayed with the plane
most of the time.''
   Martin went to the USAir operations center ``to get weather
information and fill out some paperwork. He also had a meeting with
some people in USAir's ground control office,'' Lopatkiewicz said.
   The Post said Trendel may be subpoenaed to testify before the
grand jury investigating the crash.
   The pilots' lawyer, Frederick Hafetz, did not return telephone
calls Wednesday.

<HEAD>Radio Free Europe Opens Bureau in Budapest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty
opened a bureau in Budapest on Wednesday, the first in Eastern
Europe for the two U.S.-funded radio stations.
   ``The opening of this bureau is less a cause for surprise than a
reflection of the fact that Hungary is open to the free flow of
ideas,'' the stations' president Eugene Pel said at the official
opening.
   Hungary became the first Soviet bloc country to accredit a
permanent correspondent from the stations in May.
   U.S. Ambassador Mark Palmer said, ``RFE is a strange institution
because its very aim is to self-destruct. ... We hope it will
achieve this in Hungary.''
   Radio Free Europe was founded in 1949 and Radio Liberty two
years later to inform people in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
about issues they could not learn from the official media.
   However, in the wake of far-reaching political reforms,
Hungarian state media have become increasingly open and critical.
   The sister stations, with headquarters in Munich, West Germany,
are controlled by the Washington-based Board of International
Broadcasting and are funded by the U.S. government.
   Radio Liberty broadcasts in 12 languages to the Soviet Union,
while Radio Free Europe transmits to Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Poland and Romania, as well as the Soviet states of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. They reach about 55 million people.
   After being jammed for decades, the stations recently have
benefited from a spirit of openness being promoted by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   However, Palmer noted some Warsaw Pact members still are
resistant to reform. ``There are still some countries in the region
which need Radio Free Europe,'' he said.
   The Budapest office is to be staffed by a correspondent from the
station's news and current affairs division and by programmers from
Hungary's broadcasting department. It is to broadcast daily news
and reports about Hungarian events and issues, as well as live
programs, station officials said.
   Wednesday's reception was attended by leading members of all the
main opposition parties and groups in Hungary.
   None of the invited Communist leaders were there, but U.S.
officials familiar with Hungarian affairs suggested they may have
stayed away because of political commitments.
   Parliament is meeting this week to discuss key legislation to
pave the way for transition to a multiparty system. The Communist
Party also is to hold a key congress in Budapest next week at which
reformists and hard-liners are expected to clash.
   In the past, the Communist leadership perceived Radio Free
Europe as a subversive force.
   During the anti-Communist uprising in 1956, Radio Free Europe
broadcasts led many Hungarians to believe the West would help when
Soviet troops invaded to crush the revolt. This did not
materialize, and many Hungarians have remained resentful.
   Nevertheless, the station is popular in Hungary, particularly
among the country's youth and intellectuals.

<HEAD>Watkins Orders Further Tests on Key Weapons Reactors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move that could further delay the
production of a scarce gas needed for nuclear warheads, Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins on Wednesday ordered additional testing
of the government's tritium reactors before they are restarted.
   In a brief announcement, Watkins said all three
tritium-producing reactors at the Savannah River plant near Aiken,
S.C. would undergo ultrasonic testing for cracks before they are
restarted.
   Watkins provided no details. His spokeswoman, Christina Sankey,
later said the decision was a change from earlier acceptance of a
recommendation by the plant operator, Westinghouse Corp., that
ultrasonic testing need not be completed before the first reactor
is restarted.
   Ms. Sankey said it was ``too early to tell'' whether the
additional testing would mean a further delay in restarting the
first reactor, designated K reactor.
   Watkins announced Sept. 7 that low-power testing of the reactor
would begin late next summer and that production would be resumed
sometime in the October-December quarter of 1990.
   He said he would review the timetable next April.
   Tritium is a rare radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to boost
the destructive power of nuclear warheads, and to provide most of
the power of thermonuclear warheads. About 5.5 percent of any
amount decays in the course of a year, which means that warheads in
service must periodically receive new supplies of the gas.
   All three reactors have been closed for more than a year for
repairs and safety improvements.
   Recent ultrasonic testing on the P reactor vessel at Savannah
River had discovered ``a potential indication'' of a crack ``in
excess of nine inches'' in the area of a welded seam, Watkins said.
   This finding is still being studied and further tests are being
performed, Watkins said. Ms. Sankey said later, ``We're quite
confident there is no crack'' in the vessel.
   Ms. Sankey said there was ``no technical reason'' to condition a
K reactor restart on completion of the ultrasonic testing, but that
Watkins chose to impose the condition in order to ``instill greater
public confidence in the restart program.''
   In ultrasonic testing, high-frequency sound waves are passed
through the reactor vessel walls, and any abnormalities show up as
breaks in the waves. The Energy Department last year had said it
would require the completion of ultrasonic testing of the three
reactors before any were restarted, but the requirement was dropped
after Westinghouse took over from E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. as
operator of the plant last April.
   James Moore, president of the Westinghouse unit that is running
the Savannah River complex, said in an interview last spring that
ultrasonic testing for cracks would be ``just an added burden''
that would not enhance safety.
   Ms. Sankey said Watkins decided this week to overrule the
Westinghouse recommendation after it was roundly cricitized by some
of his own advisers. Environmental groups opposed to operation of
the reactors also had criticized the plan.
   A leak from a crack in the vessel of another Savannah River
reactor, known as C reactor, was discovered in 1984. That led to
its permanent shutdown a year later.

   The foreign ministers of Britain and West
Germany said Wednesday that only democratic and economic reforms in
communist nations will stop people from fleeing.
   They cited the exodus of refugees from East Germany and Hong
Kong residents who fear Chinese rule.
   The foreign ministers of Cuba, Portugal, Bangladesh, the
Philippines and Israel also addressed the U.N. General Assembly.
Cuba accused the United States of meddling in the affairs of its
neighbors to the south.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering exercised his right of reply
at the end of the day's debate, rising to protest ``the contentious
language and distortions by the foreign minister of Cuba.''
   Speeches began Monday as part of the General Assembly's annual
three-week debate of political, economic and social problems.
   Foreign Secretary John Major of Britain said London will offer
resettlement in Britain to Hong Kong residents anxious over Chinese
rule, which will begin in 1997.
   Many Hong Kong residents are worried about their future under
communist China following its repression of the student-led
pro-democracy movement in June.
   ``Millions of us around the world were shocked to see Chinese
troops kill and wound their fellow citizens on the orders of their
own government,'' Major said. ``No government can survive
indefinitely by the suppression of peaceful dissent.''
   Major said Britain will offer ``a package to encourage people
essential to Hong Kong's future stability and prosperity to stay
there, by giving them guarantees of resettlement in Britain if they
wish. That package would be designed not to strip Hong Kong of its
people, but to give them hope and confidence to remain.''
   He did not elaborate.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany lamented
the exodus of East Germans, who have fled their country for greater
freedom in West Germany.
   ``Deeply moved, we witness the fate of young people who are
sorrowfully leaving their home and their familiar surroundings'' he
said.
   East Germany blames the West for encouraging its people to leave
with false promises of a better life.
   But Genscher said reforms ``would open up new prospects in the
German Democratic Republic, as in other central and Eastern
European countries. This will encourage the people to stay.''
   He also reassured Poland, the victim of German aggression in
World War II, that West Germany would never again threaten its
frontiers.
   ``The wheel of history will not be turned back,'' Genscher said.
   Most leaders who have addressed the General Assembly this week
have expressed optimism about resolving international conflicts.
   But Foreign Minister Isidoro Malmierca of Cuba said ``we have a
difficult road ahead'' unless Washington gives up its ``policy of
arrogance.''
   Malmierca accused Washington of fomenting unrest in Panama with
its troops stationed in the Canal Zone, and of meddling in
Nicaragua's 1990 election by funding the opposition candidates.
   In addition, said Malmierca, ``The people of Puerto Rico linger
under a foreign boot, after almost 100 years of U.S. military
occupation.''
   Portugal's foreign minister, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, requested
more world aid for Africa to aid ``the refugees and displaced
persons'' driven from their homes by conflict in Angola,
Mozambique, Namibia and South Africa.
   Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul S. Manglapus called for
establishment of an international advisory commission in which
lender and creditor nations could discuss debt relief plans and
development.
   The United States has expressed a preference to conduct
negotiations of that type through the World Bank.
   Bangladesh's foreign minister, Anisul Islam Mahmud, also called
for debt relief for developing nations. ``The proportion of
`hardcore poor' in these countries has increased staggeringly,'' he
said.
   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens appealed for world support
of Israel's plan for elections in the occupied territories, but
made no mention of Egypt's proposal to bring together Israeli and
Palestinian leaders for talks in Cairo.
   He said Palestinians in the occupied lands should end their
uprising; the 20 Arab nations still technically at war with Israel
ought to begin normalizing relations, and asked world help in
rehabilitating Palestinian refugee camps.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization's permanent observer,
Zuhdi Labib Terzi, protested later that his people are resisting
Israeli occupation and military rule and ``more than 700 have been
the victims of those atrocities'' since the uprising began.
   The speeches begin the General Assembly's annual three-month
session.

   Senate rejection of a $300 million addition to
President Bush's Star Wars proposal reflects an increasing
congressional sentiment to limit the program, Majority Leader
George Mitchell said Wednesday.
   The Senate, as part of its work on a $288 billion military
spending bill, refused a day earlier to restore funds for Star Wars
to a level closer to the $4.5 billion it approved last month in
authorization legislation.
   The overwhelming vote of 66-34 was perceived by some lawmakers
as a blow to the program.
   ``I think there is a growing recognition ... that we have to
reduce our expectations and level of resources committed to it,''
Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters. The Senate vote was ``a strong
indication of concern in that regard,'' he said.
   President Reagan proposed Star Wars, formally known as the
Strategic Defense Initiative, six years ago, hailing it as a
nuclear-age antidote to a strike against the United States.
   But Vice President Dan Quayle's recent comment that the Reagan
administration's SDI ``astrodome'' approach to protect the United
States was ``political jargon,'' and the Soviet Union's decision to
separate Star Wars from a strategic arms reduction treaty have
undercut support for the program.
   ``SDI has now been cut loose,'' Sen. John Warner of Virginia,
ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said Tuesday.
   Work on the military spending bill was put aside Wednesday as
the Senate took up a $9.4 billion compromise plan to pay for the
Bush administration's war on drugs. That plan was approved 97-2.
   Later in the day, however, the Senate did briefly take up the
bill and passed by voice vote an amendment limiting production of
the airborne self-protection jammer until further testing is
completed. In addition, a non-binding resolution was introduced
calling for U.S. participation in a multinational anti-drug strike
force.
   The Senate will vote on that measure Thursday when it is
expected to complete the appropriations bill. A handful of
amendments on anti-satellite weapons, U.S. troop levels in Europe
and Star Wars are still pending.
   The Senate Appropriations Committee, in adopting the spending
legislation, approved on a 16-11 vote a measure requiring that $820
million of the $3.7 billion for Star Wars be used for research on
lasers and particle beams.
   Proponents of the amendment expressed concerns that the
administration will sacrifice long-term research on directed energy
weapons such as lasers and particle beams in favor of a ``quick fix
or a Phase 1 deployment'' that would favor the so-called
``Brilliant Pebbles'' scheme favored by many in the administration.
   The funding level for Star Wars adopted in the appropriations
bill totals about $4.1 billion _ $3.7 billion for the Pentagon's
program and $355 million in Energy Department and military
construction money. That falls $900 million short of what Bush
requested for the program in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Among the other amendments are:
   _A measure to bar funds for anti-satellite weapons tests unless
the administration could certify that the Soviets had engaged in
tests of their own, had refused to bargain in good faith in
limitations and had blocked international verification efforts.
   _A proposal calling for either a reduction of 30,000 American
troops stationed in Europe or a requirement that U.S. allies foot
the bill for those personnel if NATO and the Warsaw Pact nations
fail to reach a conventional arms agreement by Oct. 1, 1990.

   Czechoslovakia agreed Wednesday to consider a
U.S. request for holding periodic talks on human rights in the
Central European country.
   A senior U.S. official said Secretary of State James A. Baker
III made the request in a meeting with Foreign Minister Jaromir
Johanes.
   Baker also asked the Czechoslovakian official to review the
cases of a handful of jailed demonstrators.
   The meeting was the first bewteen a U.S. secretary of state and
a Czechoslovakian foreign minister in 11 years.
   Baker proposed to the foreign minister setting up a so-called
``working group'' of American and Czechoslovakian diplomats to meet
periodicially on human rights cases, a U.S. official said.
   Working groups have been instrumental in settling scores of
human rights cases in the Soviet Union. Johanes said his government
would consider the proposal. He also told Baker that laws bearing
on human rights were being revised, said the U.S. official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The foreign minister outlined some economic reforms under way in
Prague. But Baker emphasized that they should be accompanied by
political reform.

   Cambodian forces could quickly
defeat Khmer Rouge guerrillas if Thailand stopped giving them
shelter, Vietnamese military officers said Wednesday.
   In Thailand, the country's top military leader said Bangkok will
stop aiding the guerrillas after it has confirmed that Vietnamese
soliders have indeed left the country, and after all other foreign
aid is halted.
   Relief officials, meanwhile, said a large Khmer Rouge refugee
camp just inside the Thai border was shelled from Cambodia,
presumably by government forces.
   The Khmer Rouge reported a new offensive on the strategic
Cambodian city of Pailin and contended Vietnamese soldiers still
were defending the city. Vietnam denied the allegation, insisting
it withdrew the last of its troops Tuesday.
   Officers from Vietnam's 5th Division, one of the most active in
fighting in Cambodia, said they had achieved all their goals before
withdrawing from their Communist neighbor after a 10-year
occupation.
   ``The difficulties which our division faced in the Cambodian war
were very minor compared with those faced in the war with
America,'' said Bui Buc Tran, deputy commander of the 5th Division.
   ``In the American war, we had the philosophy that one doesn't
win because of equipment and supplies, but because one's cause is
just. I think the Cambodian people also have a just cause in trying
to prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge,'' he said.
   About 2,000 of the withdrawn troops are being housed on this
base near Tay Ninh, about 35 miles from the Cambodia border.
   At the United Nations in New York, foreign ministers Roland
Dumas of France and Ali Alatas of Indonesia on Wednesday welcomed
Vietnam's withdrawal but asked new diplomatic negotiations to reach
a comprehensive peace settlement.
   France and Indonesia are leaders of the International Conference
on Cambodia, which broke up in Paris in August after the warring
parties failed to agree on a peace plan.
   The Khmer Rouge are loosely allied to two non-communist
guerrilla groups that have been fighting the Phnom Penh government
and the Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and toppled a
Khmer Rouge government.
   The Khmer Rouge were in power in Cambodia from 1975-78. During
that time, hundreds of thousands of Cambodians died from Khmer
Rouge executions, famine and civil unrest.
   After its invasion, Vietnam helped the pro-Hanoi government it
installed in Phnom Penh battle the Khmer Rouge and two other
guerrilla groups armed by China and granted sanctuaries inside
Thailand.
   ``If the Thai government stops its support of the guerrillas,
the Cambodian government will have no problem ending the
insurgency,'' Tran said. ``We are completely satisfied that the
Cambodian people now have the full ability to defend themselves.''
   In Bangkok, Gen. Pat Akkanibut of Thailand's Supreme Military
Command told The Associated Press that Thailand's backing would
continue until Vietnam's withdrawal could be proved and external
military aid from all sides halted. The Soviet Union is the major
weapons supplier for Cambodian government troops.
   Fighting along the Thai-Cambodian border has intensified in
recent weeks during the Vietnam pullout.
   The Khmer Rouge radio said its guerrillas have begun a new
offensive on the gem-trading center of Pailin in western Cambodia
and were shelling the town from all sides.
   The guerrilla radio, the Voice of the National Army of
Democratic Kampuchea, has claimed battle successes around Pailin.
The town is northwest of Phnom Penh and close to the Thai frontier.
   The radio charged that Hanoi has sent 3,000 troops to help
defend Pailin.
   Vietnamese military spokesman Thai denied the claims but
acknowledged guerrilla forces had taken some territory.
   Hundreds of shells pelted a Khmer Rouge refugee camp near the
Cambodian border Wednesday, forcing thousands of refugees to flee
or take cover, a relief official said.

<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs to UPDATE with Senate resolution to examine needs

   President Bush gave new ammunition to
congressional Democrats Wednesday when he called on the
International Monetary Fund to increase aid for Poland's
beleaguered economy but said he was not ready to call for
additional U.S. help.
   Bush has been wrangling with the majority Democrats since he
revealed his proposal for $219 million in assistance to Poland and
Hungary during his much-publicized summer trip to Warsaw.
   The Democrats, who control the Senate and the House, have
demanded that Bush up the ante and do substantially more for
Eastern Europe, up to $3.7 billion more when the costs of
Democratic economic and food-aid plans are totaled.
   Bush has resisted, contending that it is inappropriate to give
more aid until the Poles themselves demonstrate they can and will
revolutionize their country's state-run communist economy and turn
to free-market principles.
   Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, accuse the Democrats of
political ``one-upmanship'' in a politically motivated bidding game.
   The Republicans are irked that the Democratic leadership is
characterizing the Bush proposals as ``pathetically timid'' and
``woefully inadequate.''
   On Wednesday, the scenario took another turn as Bush urged the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to ``do more'' for
Poland because of ``our self-evident stake in its success.''
   ``For its part, the United States intends to be out in front of
this effort, to take advantage of this historic development and to
ensure its success,'' Bush said.
   But immediately after his address the president told questioning
reporters he is not now prepared to commit himself to increasing
his own aid package for Poland.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine, leading the
recent chorus of Democratic criticism, repeatedly has described the
administration's response to a potentially historic opening toward
democracy in Eastern Europe as inadequate and disappointing.
   ``The administration's timidity in the face of these
opportunities is puzzling and dismaying,'' Mitchell said in a
Senate speech last week.
   Bush supports making $119 million in economic assistance
available to Poland over the next three years. He also proposes
$100 million in food assistance, an amount that was doubled from a
proposed $50 million after the personal intervention of Senate
Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who met with Polish leaders
in Warsaw last month.
   Congressional Democrats are rallying support for food and
economic assistance packages for Eastern Europe that total at least
$3.7 billion, most of it earmarked for Poland.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ignoring boycotting
Republicans, voted 10-1 a week ago to send to the Senate floor a
$1.18 billion, three-year, economic aid package for Poland and
Hungary.
   That Democratic proposal would authorize $423 million in the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, and $381 million in each of the
next two years.
   The centerpiece of the plan is an annual $300 million
``enterprise fund'' to support private economic development in
Poland and a similar $75 million annual aid fund for Hungary.
   On Tuesday, eight Democratic members of the Senate Agriculture
Committee proposed canceling Poland's $2 billion agricultural debt
to the United States as the keystone of a $2.25 billion food aid
package.
   Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., urged Bush to accept the
proposal, which would give Poland $150 million in corn, grain,
sorghum, wheat, butter and pork products. The plan also seeks
authorization of an additional $150 million in other assistance and
calls for the extension of preferential tariff treatment and
technical agricultural aid.
   ``The president's plan is a welcome but stop-gap effort that
fails to give Poland the long-term help it needs to restructure its
agricultural economy and to sustain the world's newest economy,''
Leahy said.
   Joining the opposition chorus for increasing aid to Poland,
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said recently that
the changing political environment in Poland and Hungary is so
potentially historic that Congress should quickly appropriate
everything Bush has requested, then make substantial additions.
   Meanwhile, the Senate approved a resolution Wednesday to
dispatch a team of legislative and administrative experts to assess
the immediate needs of Poland's new non-communist parliament.
   The aim of the resolution, sponsored by Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., is to lay the groundwork for a ``first gift of democracy''
from Congress and the U.S. private sector to the two-chamber
parliament in Warsaw.
   The measure, which must also be endorsed by the House, was
approved by voice vote.
   Domenici, recently returned from discussions with
parliamentarians in Warsaw, said they lack the most rudimentary
equipment to do their jobs, including typewriters, computers,
copying machines and research and information facilities.

   Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal
Cavaco Silva laid a wreath Wednesday at the tomb of Mozambicans who
died fighting for independence from Portugal, then discussed
improving relations with the former colony.
   At a meeting with Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, Cavaco
Silva said the traumas of the past are over.
   ``We must have a spirit of construction,'' he said.
   The two men met on the second day of the Portuguese leader's
five-day visit.
   ``We want to consolidate the existing relations between Portugal
and Mozambique that have been forged over centuries,'' Chissano
said.
   Cooperation between the two governments should ``bring mutual
benefits, despite the unequal levels of development,'' he said in
apparent reference to the lack of infrastructure and trained
professionals in Mozambique when Portuguese colonialism ended.
   Chissano invited Portuguese companies to help increase food
production in Mozambique, where nearly half the 14 million people
need partial or complete food aid. He also suggested Portugal's
membership in the European Community could be used to the benefit
of Mozambique and other African countries.
   The Portuguese leader appeared to agree.
   ``The tendency just to look eastwards (in Europe), leaving
Africa aside, should be avoided,'' he said.
   Mozambique's economy has been drained by a civil war that has
continued since independence in 1975. Rebels of the right-leaning
Mozambique National Resistance presently are engaged in peace talks
with Mozambican church leaders representing the Marxist government.
   Cavaco Silva earlier had laid a wreath at the star-shaped white
marble Monument of Heroes, the burial place of several prominent
members of the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique who died in
the revolution that led to independence. Among them are Samora
Machel, Mozambique's first president, and Eduardo Mondlane, the
first nationalist leader whom most Mozambicans believe was killed
by Portuguese secret police. Machel died in an October 1986 plane
crash that officials here blame on South Africa _ a charge Pretoria
denies.

<HEAD>Iranian Religious Leader Condemns Execution of 16 Shiites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The religious leader of Iran on Wednesday
condemned the execution of 16 Kuwaiti Shiite Moslems in Saudi
Arabia and called for the holy city of Mecca to be liberated ``from
the claws of oppression.''
   ``The Saudi agents beheaded 16 of the best children of Islam ...
and added another black page to the thick volume of their black
book,'' Ayatollah Mohammad Araki said in a statement read on Tehran
radio, monitored in Cyprus.
   Araki, 99, was appointed paramount religious leader, or marja'
taqlid, by the country's top theologians after the June 3 death of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Khomeini, who died of a heart attack at age 86, was Iran's
highest religious and political authority. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
voted to succed him in the political role, is a middle-ranking
cleric and lacks the authority needed to rule on religious matters.
   The 16 Shiites were beheaded after they were convicted by Saudi
authorities of planting bombs in Mecca that killed a Pakistani man
and wounded 16 other pilgrims July 10.
   After the death sentences were carried out, Saudi television
screened taped interviews of the condemned men in which they
confessed to setting the bombs and said two Iranians at the Iranian
Embassy in Kuwait supplied them with explosives and training. Iran
denied it.
   Araki said it was up to the Moslem clerics ``not to remain
silent,'' adding:
   ``It is up to them to raise their cry to inform the public, to
support Islam and the religion of God and to salvage the two holy
places from the claws of oppression and the government of the
blasphemers.''
   Iranian leaders have long demanded that Mecca and Medina,
Islam's holiest cities, be wrested from the control of the Saudi
royal family and put in charge of an international commission.
   Following the executions, Iranian leaders repeatedly have called
for revenge against Saudi Arabia.
   On Wednesday, four masked men who said they represented
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia held a news
conference in Beirut and threatened to punish Saudi Arabia.
   The executions brought to an end recent efforts to improve
relations between Shiite Moslem Iran and Saudi Arabia, which
follows the Sunni Moslem sect. The two sects have been antagonistic
since a split in Islam in the 7th century.
   Relations between Tehran and Riyadh previously reached their
nadir in 1987 when more than 400 pilgrims, most of them Iranian,
were killed in clashes with Saudi security forces in Mecca.

<HEAD>Rep. Luken: Perpetrators Off The Hook For `Environmental Scandal
Of Century'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government employees in charge of America's
bomb factories and the contractors who run the plants ``have been
let off the hook for the biggest environmental scandal of the
century,'' Rep. Thomas Luken complained Wednesday.
   Luken, D-Ohio, heads a House subcommittee that's been probing
problems at the nation's nuclear weapons plants, which are so
contaminated that the Energy Department expects cleanup costs to
exceed $90 billion.
   Luken made public a letter in which the Justice Department said
neither Environmental Protection Agency nor Federal Bureau of
Investigation had ever sought prosecution of environmental crimes
at weapons plants. Just one case has ever been referred to
prosecutors, involving a 1983 incident in Tennessee, but no charges
were brought, the congressman's staff said.
   ``The unprecedented radioactive and hazardous waste pollution at
DOE's weapons plants results directly from the failure to hold
anyone accountable,'' Luken said in a statement.
   ``Until environmental crimes at the weapons plants lead to jail
sentences, and until DOE holds its contractors' feet to the fire,
DOE will continue to pollute faster than it is cleaning up,'' said
Luken, repeating his contention that someone should be put behind
bars as punishment for the years of radioactive and hazardous waste
contamination.
   ``Incredibly, the Department of Justice and the DOE inspector
general are now telling us that DOE's contractors and their
employees have been let off the hook for the biggest environmental
scandal of the century,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, put into the Senate record
a DOE inspector general report urging changes in the way the
government handles weapons-plant contracts.
   ``The lessons of the past tell us that to a major extent the
enormous and costly problems facing the DOE`s nuclear program are
due to a basic failure to adopt normal practices of
accountability,'' Glenn said.
   The report, prepared at Glenn's request, said the government's
been forced to pay obviously fraudulent expenses and is barred from
ordering the firing of incompetent weapons plant workers because of
the way its contracts are written.
   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said the department would
demand stronger contracts when they come up for renewal.

   Governors at the education summit
pressed the Bush administration Wednesday to free states and local
districts from restrictions on federal school money, and urged
greater commitment to early childhood programs.
   The two issues were among key themes emerging at the first
working sessions of the two-day summit between President Bush, his
Cabinet and the nation's governors.
   Of the first three sessions, all of which were behind closed
doors, the most contentious was apparently on the topic, ``the
learning environment.''
   The moderator of the session, federal drug policy coordinator
William J. Bennett, said in an often sarcastic summary to reporters
that there was ``lots of talk about early childhood. Everyone
agreed they like little children.'' But he said that unless the
nation did something about poor schools in later grades, spending
more money on early education programs would be a waste.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, in a summary of a second working
session, ``Governance: Who's in Charge,'' said much of the
discussion had to do with how to ``exchange red tape for results.''
   New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers, a Republican who co-chaired
that panel with Democrat Clinton, told reporters that Bush had
spent 40 minutes in the session, and had responded to governors'
pleas for more spending freedom with a challenge for more specifics
on how states would demonstrate results in the absence of
regulations.
   Carruthers said governors told the president: ``Let us do it our
own way. We will demonstrate that we're doing it better.''
   A third session on how to revitalize the teaching profession
centered on, among other issues, how to recruit more minorities.
But the discussion included ``a recognition that for a long time to
come minority students will be taught mainly by white teachers,''
said Democratic Washington Gov. Booth Gardner, co-chair of that
group.
   A two-page memo summarizing objectives for the summit by the
National Governors' Association outlined seven general national
performance goals which members hoped would become more specific as
the meetings progressed.
   The memo, a copy of which was given to The Associated Press on
Wednesday, outlined points that governors were to make during
closed-door working sessions with Bush.
   Those goals, according to the document, were that:
   _All children be ready for first grade by the time they reach
the appropriate age.
   _Student achievement levels ``rise to internationally
competitive levels, especially in math and science.''
   _Disparities in achievement between students of different races
and economic backgrounds ``be dramatically reduced.''
   _The number of students going to college or other higher
education be greatly increased.
   _Adult illiteracy be ``virtually eliminated.''
   _Schools have well-trained teachers and modern technology.
   The memo proposed that once goals are set and steps taken to
achieve them, ``we should move to a report card issued every year
on the efforts of students, schools, the states, and the federal
government.''
   The governors' memo also suggested that the summit be used to
push changes to give states more flexibility in using federal
education dollars and to eliminate unnecessary regulation.
   At an opening news conference, the governors stressed national
goals and played down the issue of federal money at the summit.
   ``The federal funding question is not the major issue for this
summit,'' said Clinton.
   ``If we don't have national performance goals, how are we going
to move from the bottom to top in international exams in math and
science? How are we going to stop being the only advanced economy
in the world that has no system for guaranteeing that all
5-year-olds are ready to start school?'' he asked.
   Still, on the issue of money, the memo said governors would be
calling on the federal government to ``keep commitments it has
already made.''
   It suggested that governors urge Bush to get each member of his
Cabinet to target federal resources to ten of the largest and most
troubled districts and ``50 to 100 poor rural districts'' to reduce
racial and economic disparities in educational opportunities.
   States, for their part, should agree to ``restructure the
education system in each state,'' work with the federal government
to reduce losses in the student loan program, and work toward
drug-free schools, the memo said.

   Israeli and Soviet officials agreed Wednesday to an
exchange of chambers of commerce and a framework to establish
``direct economic relations,'' an Israeli official said.
   Moscow broke diplomatic relations with Israel following the 1967
Middle East war and the two countries have virtually no economic
ties.
   ``This is not a political agreement, but one purely of economic
cooperation between our two countries,'' the official told
reporters on condition of anonymity.
   He said the accord calls for the opening of an Israeli chamber
of commerce in Moscow and a Soviet one in Tel Aviv before the end
of the year.
   Official approval of the agreement is to take place in Tel Aviv
in November, he said.
   At meetings Tuesday and Wednesday, the delegations also agreed
to a framework for broad cooperation in economic, technological and
scientific domains, he said.
   They agreed that cooperation between the non-political chambers
of commerce was the best way for the two countries to re-establish
economic ties.
   The only East bloc nation to have diplomatic relations with
Israel is Hungary, which re-established ties Sept. 18, 1988.
   The Israeli official said the agreement provides an
institutional framework for collaboration, but did not describe
specific projects.
   Israel's delegation was led by Danny Gillerman, president of the
Federation of the Israeli Chamber of Commerce, and Yaacov Cohen,
director-general of the Industry Ministry.
   Vladimir Golanov, first vice-president of the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry led the Soviet delegation.

   China told the global financial community
Wednesday that despite setbacks and problems its policy of economic
reform and opening to the outside world ``shall never be altered.''
   Economic liberalization in the past decade has generated
prosperity, vitality and ``genuine benefits,'' and has become
``popular and deep-rooted among the Chinese people,'' Li Guixian,
state councillor and governor of the People's Bank of China, told
the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund.
   ``No matter what setbacks and difficulties may arise on our way
forward, the determination of the Chinese government and its people
in continuing the reform and opening policy shall never be
altered,'' Li said.
   The speech, regarded as an important statement of policy in the
wake of China's upheaval the past summer, was silent on the issue
of political liberalization.
   It left delegates from 151 other countries wondering if Li was
including Beijing's leadership shakeup, imposition of martial law
and the killing and arrests of democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen
Square when he said reform and opening to world are ``by no means
easy for a complex country like China ... and at times we will
encounter difficulties and setbacks.''
   But he assured his audience of hundreds of government officials
and bankers that China intends to improve its attractiveness for
foreign investment and to pay its debts.
   ``We have been continung our efforts to improve the ... climate
in order to attract foreign investors ... the Chinese government
places high priority on creditworthiness and enjoys sufficient
capacity to service its debts,'' he said.
   ``We respect all foreign governments and friends who would like
to develop relations with us on equal terms, and it is our
intention to further develop and expand our friendly relations with
them,'' Li said.
   Western governments and businesses scaled down their relations
with China after the June crackdown. Numerous foreign companies are
in the process of deciding whether to pursue their investments in
China. The World Bank, on whose board of governors Li Guixian has a
seat, in June held up $780 million worth of loans for projects in
China to await economic and political developments there.

   The 21-year-old Briton, who was arrested Sept. 2, will be
expelled after he has served his time and will be barred from
Sweden for 10 years, the radio said.
   His identity was withheld in line with Swedish press regulations.
   The court said the Briton, seemingly without reason, attacked
and assaulted a Swede outside a Stockholm night club, causing a
severe eye injury. Later that evening, he beat another Swedish
youth, it said.
   The Briton admitted the first beating, but denied the second,
although several witnesses identified him, the national news agency
TT said.
   More than 200 English and Swedish supporters were arrested in
brawls before and after the match, which ended in a 0-0 draw.

<HEAD>Former Education Secretary Pans `Pap' At Summit</HEAD>

   Drug czar William Bennett, a bit
player in President Bush's education summit with the governors,
stole a scene Tuesday night with a stinging review of one of the
closed-door discussions.
   The truculent former Reagan administration secretary of
education moderated one of the sessions and had some ``feisty''
exchanges with New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and other Democrats over
defense spending.
   But in summarizing the talks afterward for reporters, Bennett
gave what was in effect a pox on both their houses, Democrats and
Republicans alike.
   Bennett, a onetime philosophy professor, said, ``There was pap;
standard Democratic pap. There was standard Republican pap, and
there was stuff that rhymes with pap on both sides, too.''
   There were ``a couple of good exchanges, an occasional outburst
of candor ... attempts to suppress it, but a few people persisted
in candor so we got a few points made,'' said Bennett.
   ``Much of the discussion took part in total absence of any
knowledge of what works or what's effective in the actual
experience of school,'' said Bennett, who published a series of
``What Works'' guides when he ran the Department of Education from
1985 to 1988.
   Several governors, including Mississippi's Ray Mabus, spoke to
the importance of federal programs to help feed and nurture infants
and pre-school children, including Head Start.
   But Bennett felt the emphasis on pre-school development was
being ballyhooed.
   ``There was a lot of talk about early childhood. Everyone likes
small children and wants to do better by them,'' he said.
   But, he added, ``you can't fix American education simply by
focusing on early childhood because if you give kids good early
education but you mess it up after that when they go into regular
schools, you haven't done anything more than just spend more
money.''
   He said everyone liked the idea of national performance goals
for education.
   One governor ``suggested that his fanny would be out if he
didn't reach his accountability goals, which I thought was
encouraging and candid,'' said Bennett.
   Bennett said sardonically, ``There is progress in one part of
America's curriculum, and that is the self-esteem curriculum. We
are doing worse, but feeling much better about it.''
   In a recent international comparison, American students scored
last in math and Koreans first, he said, but when asked if they
were good at math, 68 percent of the U.S. youths said yes compared
to only 23 percent of the Koreans.
   ``That is a sort of drug-induced curriculum,'' said Bennett.
``People feel good on drugs while not doing good at all.''
   Asked why he felt much of the discussion was uninformed, Bennett
replied, ``Some people were saying things that other people had
written for them, and they were reading them out of books and
reading them off cards, and that's fine but what we were hoping for
was a candid discussion.''
   ``Some people really talked; some people didn't,'' said Bennett.

<TEXT>
   A blast of cold air hit the upper Great Lakes on Wednesday and
most of the nation had sunny skies, except for light snow in Maine
and rain in some parts of the South and the West.
   In Michigan, Grand Rapids had a reading of 29 degrees, breaking
the Sept. 27, 1947, low of 30 degrees. Muskegon's temperature
dropped to 27, breaking the record of 30 set in 1947, and Sault
Ste. Marie recorded a 26-degree reading, 2 degrees under a
14-year-old record.
   A record low of 36 degrees for the date was set in Mansfield,
Ohio.
   Colder temperatures were expected to move across the northern
Appalachians by Thursday morning. Overnight warnings for frost or
freezing temperatures were posted in southern Vermont, southern New
England, parts of New York, northeast Pennsylvania and portions of
eastern West Virginia.
   Skies were sunny over much of the nation Wednesday afternoon
except for northern Maine, which had snow showers. Also, rain and
thunderstorms reached from southern Georgia across the Florida
Peninsula, along the lower Texas Gulf Coast, and from Utah into
western Wyoming.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.33 inches at the Naval Air Station near Jacksonville,
Fla.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 43 degrees at Caribou,
Maine, to 101 degrees at Yuma, Ariz. Low temperature for the Lower
48 states was 21 degrees at Houghton Lake and Pellston, Mich.

<HEAD>Last Vietnamese Soldier Leaves Cambodia, Top Hanoi General Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior military officer said
Wednesday that the last Vietnamese soldiers were hauled out of
Cambodia atop broken-down trucks to end Vietnam's nearly
11-year-long war in Cambodia.
   ``Now there are absolutely no Vietnamese soldiers in Cambodia,''
said Gen. Nguyen Van Thai, chief spokesman for the Ministry of
Defense.
   Thai also disclosed that Vietnam will spend $5 million to move
to Vietnam the graves of Vietnamese soldiers who were buried in
Cambodia.
   And he said two soldiers died during the six-day pullout, making
them the last casualties in the conflict that has cost 55,300
Vietnamese lives.
   Several Vietnamese soldiers riding in vehicles that had broken
down on their way home were towed across the border at Moc Bai, 112
miles from Ho Chi Minh City, between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday,
Thai said.
   Most of the soldiers had crossed by noon.
   Thai made his comments to several reporters, including The
Associated Press.
   Troops at the Moc Bai border crossing were serenaded by popular
singers and cheered by thousands of children in an emotional
homecoming earlier Tuesday.
   Vietnam says it has withdrawn the last 26,000 of its troops in
Cambodia, although the Cambodian guerrilla resistance calls the
pullout a sham.
   Rebel radio broadcasts monitored in Bangkok, Thailand, on
Wednesday said Khmer Rouge troops launched a three-pronged attack
on the gem-rich town of Pailin on the Thai-Cambodian border. The
broadcast claimed 3,000 Vietnamese troops were defending Pailin.
   Thai denied the claims about Vietnamese soldiers but
acknowledged that guerrilla forces had taken some territory. He
said Vietnamese troops left the area last year.
   The announced Vietnamese withdrawal has raised fears that
Cambodia will slide into a protracted civil war. Wars and bloody
revolution have kept Cambodia torn by conflict for the last 20
years.
   Of the last two Vietnamese soldiers killed in Cambodia, one died
on Sunday when the truck he was riding in overturned, throwing him
into the Mekong River. The same day, a second soldier died when he
and a Cambodian soldier clasped hands as the two sped by each other
in separate trucks on Route 5. Thai said the Vietnamese soldier was
yanked from his vehicle and pulled under the passing truck.
   Thai contradicted a recent report out of the Cambodian capital,
Phnom Penh, which quoted the Vietnamese ambassador to Cambodia as
saying Vietnam would continue giving military aid to Cambodia.
   Thai claimed Vietnam has no military advisers in Cambodia and
supplies no military aid to the Cambodian government. Vietnam
installed the Cambodian government in 1979 after Vietnamese troops
invaded the country, ousting the Khmer Rouge regime.
   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people during
its brutal rule from 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion in December
1978.
   Thai acknowledged many Vietnamese families are angry that their
sons and husbands are buried in Cambodia and not in Vietnam. He
said the military would dig up the graves of the war dead and bring
them back to Vietnam.
   He said many graves had been lost and remains of others were
hard to find but Vietnam would mobilize itself to get the remains
back. He estimated 90 percent of Vietnam's war dead had already
been returned home.
   ``Still,'' he said, ``not all the mothers in Vietnam can have
the remains of their sons right now.''
   Thai estimated that from 200 to 300 Vietnamese were missing in
action in Cambodia and said Vietnam would intensify its efforts to
find them.
   In Ho Chi Minh City, attention turned to the returning troops
and the difficulties they will find having jobs.
   The army says it has demobilized 500,000 men between 1987 and
1988 and that further discharges will occur this year and next.
   Col. Nguyen Huu Tinh, commander of Regiment 742, said that since
last year 70 percent of his 1,500 men have been sent back to
civilian life. He said he worries that many of them will not be
able to find work.
   One veteran, interviewed at a shoe factory, said it took him
three years to find a job after he returned from Cambodia in 1986.
Vo Dien Luong, 26, now works in an unskilled position glueing shoes
together. He said he wasn't satisfied with his work but that he had
to eat.
   Unemployment in Vietnam is generally recognized to exceed 20
percent.
   Both Tinh and Luong and other soldiers and veterans interviewed
Wednesday said they were having trouble finding girlfriends and
wives.
   Some suggest that Vietnam's inability to secure a clear victory
in Cambodia has contributed to soldiers' apparent unpopularity. But
unemployment and the low earning power of a recently demobolized
soldier are also factors.

<HEAD>Boy Lost in Mine Found After Five Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE CARTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old boy missing for nearly five
days in an abandoned mine was found Wednesday suffering from
dehydration and mild frostbite but otherwise looking ``remarkably
well.''
   Joshua Dennis was on a Boy Scout outing Friday night when he got
separated from the others in the Hidden Valley Mine in western
Utah's Oquirrh Mountains.
   ``If you don't believe in miracles, you'd better believe in
this, so help me,'' said the boy's grandfather, Robert Dennis.
   The boy was found by searchers on a ledge in the mine at about
2:45 p.m. He said he had stayed on the ledge in the pitch-black
darkness the whole time, pacing back and forth at times without
food or water.
   ``He knew he should stay put,'' said his tearful mother, Janeen
Dennis. ``He prayed. ... He said he was being taken care of while
he waited.''
   She said he had faith he would be found.
   ``He never heard rescuers until today,'' she said. ``And he
heard their voices and he yelled for help and they heard him.''
   Joshua was taken to Tooele Valley Hospital before being flown by
helicopter to a hospital in Salt Lake City.
   ``He really looks remarkably well,'' said Trudy Curtis, the
Tooele hospital's nursing director. ``Of course he's very
dehydrated, very gaunt and very tired _ maybe a little shocky.''
   ``He does have what at this point we think is a mild frostbite
on the toes,'' Curtis said. ``But this is just remarkable.''
   Dr. Tony Woodward at Primary Children's said it was not unusual
for a 10-year-old to survive without water for that period.
   The boy, from the Salt Lake suburb of Kearns, was taken to
Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City, some 45 miles
northeast of the mine, where workers had tied a yellow ribbon
around a pillar outside the emergency room and some 50 people
cheered as he was wheeled in on a stretcher.
   Joshua was last seen inside the mine Friday night with his
father, Terry Dennis, and a group of Boy Scouts the father was
helping supervise during an overnight camping trip.
   The boy told rescuers and hospital personnel he become separated
from the others and had tried to find his way out of the mine ``by
feeling the walls,'' Curtis said. Stumbling and falling at one
point, he ``got scared and just stayed put.''
   Searchers and Joshua's family had all but given up hope of
finding him alive after exhaustive searches of the mine in rugged
Dry Canyon turned up no trace of the boy, Sheriff Don Proctor said
earlier Wednesday.
   A Utah Power &amp; Light Co. mine rescue team descended into the
mine for a second day Wednesday and found the boy between 600 and
700 yards inside the eight-level labyrinth. The team was
accompanied by a guide who had been doing historical research on
the gold, silver and zinc mine, last worked in 1953.
   The family's bishop, Phillip Fielding, had spent the day with
the boy's parents in a motel and was with them when the good news
came.
   ``It's like nothing I've ever witnessed in my life _ an absolute
miracle,'' he said. ``We practically had to carry them. They were
weak with joy.''

<HEAD>Stream of Bakker Witnesses Stand Behind Their Man</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker's attorney and the judge
hearing the fraud and conspiracy case against the deposed
television evangelist clashed Wednesday over the number of
character witnesses called by the defense.
   ``We're not going to sit here the next two or three days and
hear the same thing over and over,'' U.S. District Court Judge
Robert Potter told lawyer Harold Bender.
   Wednesday's testimony was similar to that presented Tuesday,
with ardent supporters of Bakker testifying that they thought he
was a fine man who was underpaid and unjustly accused. The defense
was in its fifth day of trial, with an interruption Friday by
Hurricane Hugo.
   Arnold Santjer, who owns a ship-loading business in Bradenton,
Fla., was the 18th ``Lifetime Partner'' in the PTL ministry to
testify. He created a stir in the courtroom when he said he owned
76 lifetime partnerships costing a total of $76,000. Each $1,000
unit entitled the owner to rights to three nights yearly lodging at
the hotel at the PTL theme park.
   Asked whether he had any regrets, Santjer said, ``I'm not
unhappy. The Lord gave me the money to start with. It was his in
the beginning.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller pressed Santjer on cross
examination about his confidence in Bakker's claims that he would
limit the number of partnerships to 25,000. The indictment charges
he sold more than 66,000.
   The 6-foot-3, 220-pound Miller pointed to a water pitcher on a
table and asked Santjer: ``If Mr. Bakker said he could fit me
inside that pitcher, do you believe he could do it?''
   ``If he thinks he could, yes,'' Santjer replied.
   Bakker is accused of defrauding followers by diverting more than
$3.7 million in PTL money to fund his lavish living. He faces up to
120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines if convicted
on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
   Special prosecutor Deborah Smith asked the judge to limit the
number of character witnesses. After Wednesday's testimony, Ms.
Smith said 37 character witnesses had been called.
   Potter said his policy is to limit lawyers to five character
witnesses in a trial.
   Bender, however, disagreed that he was calling character
witnesses.
   ``We have not put up anyone for the purpose of specifically
being a character witness,'' Bender told Potter. ``These are the
partners, judge. People who have put their money into this
ministry.''
   Potter said the defense was ``invited to put on whatever defense
you feel is appropriate.'' But he issued the warning: ``I'm not
going to sit here forever.''
   Samuel Sandifer of Wilson said he bought a partnership in 1985.
   Ms. Smith asked if he objected to the use of $265,000 in
partnership money to pay church secretary Jessica Hahn for her
silence about a sexual tryst with Bakker in 1980.
   ``I have no problem if it was spent on the Heritage Grand,
Jessica Hahn or unwed mothers,'' he said. ``It's their money to
spend the way they see fit.''

   Zsa Zsa Gabor's cop-slapping case
went to a jury Wednesday after a tumultuous day that saw her bolt
tearfully from the courtroom yet again when she was characterized
as a spoiled Hollywood aristocrat.
   Miss Gabor left when Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox said
during his closing statement: ``She came to entertain you. ... She
craves the media attention in this case, it is clear.''
   It was the fourth time Miss Gabor abruptly fled the courtroom in
tears during the 13-day trial that has cost taxpayers nearly
$30,000.
   ``I want to get out of here. I want to go to Europe,'' Miss
Gabor said in the hallway. Instead, she went to the Polo Lounge at
the Beverly Hills Hotel with her husband, Prince Frederick von
Anhalt.
   As a misdemeanor defendant, accused of slapping police Officer
Paul Kramer on June 14, Miss Gabor is not required to be present at
any part of her trial, except for sentencing if convicted.
   Fox's closing statement to the jury took 70 minutes. He attacked
Miss Gabor's disruptive behavior inside and outside the courtroom.
   Jurors began deliberations at 3:30 p.m. after the final
arguments from Fox and Defense Attorney William Graysen and
instructions from Municipal Judge Charles Rubin. They ended their
deliberations at 5 p.m.
   Rubin, because of a Tuesday television news report, fined Miss
Gabor $500 for violating a gag order he imposed on the case, and
was considering a second $500 fine regarding her comments about
prosecution character witnesses.
   ``The thing that outrages me most is, she used and abused two
weeks of this process for her own aggrandizement,'' Fox said. ``The
defendant doesn't know the meaning of truth. ... Her perception of
truth differs from facts in the case.''
   Miss Gabor could receive up to 18 months in jail if convicted of
misdemeanor battery on a police officer, disobeying an officer's
orders, driving with an expired license and having an open
container of alcohol in her car.
   Fox told jurors Miss Gabor believes ``the world revolves around
Miss Gabor. What she doesn't like she denies. ... I think her true
persona has emerged in the course of this trial.''
   Kramer pulled Miss Gabor over after noticing expired
registration tags on her Rolls-Royce Corniche. She drove off as he
checked for other violations. Miss Gabor slapped Kramer when he
pulled her over a second time. Kramer said the attack was
unprovoked, but Miss Gabor said it was self-defense when he
forcibly removed her from her car.
   Graysen told the jury that Kramer used excessive force.
   ``He's a big, tough guy. He goes around threatening people,''
said Graysen. ``Officer Kramer had no right to yank Miss Gabor out
of the car. Miss Gabor wasn't a dangerous person. He knew who she
was. ... Miss Gabor had every right to slap him.''

   Defense Forces troops raided an
opposition printshop and an advertising agency Wednesday and
arrested eight people, witnesses and opposition leaders said.
   Opposition leader Ricardo Arias Calderon said in a telephone
interview that seven people, including three women, were arrested
when soldiers raided the Sigma printing plant.
   Witnesses, who asked anonymity for fear of reprisals, said the
troops loaded printing presses and other equipment onto two trucks
and carted them away.
   Another opposition source, who insisted on anonymity, said
Valerio Arauz, owner of the Cosmos advertising agency, was also
arrested in another Defense Forces raid but gave no details.
   Both companies were doing propaganda work for the Civil
Democratic Alliance, a coalition of political parties, labor unions
and other groups opposed to Panama's military dominated government.
   The alliance, popularly known by its Spanish initials as ADOC,
is engaged in a campaign to induce people not to pay taxes,
telephone or light bills, buy lottery tickets or gamble in casinos
to pressure the government into turning power over to civilians.
   Running water and virtually all the country's other public
utilities are government-owned, and so is the lottery and gambling
casinos and the government depends heavily on them for revenue.
   Guillermo Endara, ADOC's presidential candidate, has been on a
hunger strike for the past eight days as part of the campaign.
   According to international observers, both Endara and running
mate Arias Calderon won the elections May 7, which the government
annulled a few days later claiming the opposition had committed
fraud.
   Opposition leaders have been demanding that the government
respect the May 7 election and that Gen. Antonio Noriega step down
as the Defense Forces chief and cease his de facto rule of the
country.
   Noriega was indicted February 1988 by federal grand juries in
Florida of drug trafficking and money laundering charges and the
United States has been exerting pressure, including trade and other
economic sanctions on Panama, in an effort to force him out.
   So far Noriega has refused to budge, but the sanctions have left
the government short of funds.

   Parliament indicted former Premier Andreas
Papandreou early Thursday, ordering him to stand trial before a
special court on charges he was involved in the $210 million Bank
of Crete embezzlement scandal.
   The 300-member unicameral chamber also decided four of
Papandreou's former senior Cabinet members must stand trial with
him for complicity in the scandal.
   Parliament's decision by secret ballot ended a two-day debate on
evidence presented by a parliamentary commission of inquiry that
recommended the five men be prosecuted.
   The vote was 166 for, 121 against, with two blank ballots and
six that were ruled invalid. Five deputies, including Papandreou,
were not present.
   Papandreou, 70, and the former ministers from his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (PASOK) are accused of involvement in the
embezzlement of the bank along with its chairman, George Koskotas.
The investigative parliamentary committee alleged that during their
eight years in office, they skimmed off interest from money
deposited by state-controlled organizations.
   The indicted former ministers are Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, who
was deputy premier and justice minister; Giorgos Petsos of
Transport and Communications; Dimitris Tsovolas of Finance, and
Panayiotis Roumeliotis of the Ministry of National Economy.
   Four of the accused appeared in Parliament to defend themselves
during the debate while Roumeliotis, a deputy of the European
parliament, sent a memorandum.
   The accused face a minimum of five years imprisonment each if
found guilty of the charges.
   The debate began in a numbed atmosphere on Tuesday morning,
hours after terrorist gunmen killed lawmaker Pavlos Bakoyannis, a
member of the conservative New Democracy party led by his
father-in-law, Constantine Mitsotakis.
   Bakoyannis' acknowledged killers, the elusive November 17
organization, charged in a proclamation that he acted as a front
when Koskotas, the bank scandal's central figure, set up a
publishing company prior to buying the Bank of Crete in 1982.
   Making one of his rare appearances in Parliament, Papandreou
told the packed chamber Wednesday that, ``I have come not to
respond to the transparent charges nor to my slanderers but to
restore the truth.''
   He pointed out that accusations he accepted bribes from Koskotas
and that he authorized the embezzlement scheme were based solely on
Koskotas' testimony.
   Papandreou accused ``local and foreign interests'' of being
behind what he called his defamation, a charge that he has made
repeatedly since the Bank of Crete scandal officially broke last
October.
   Before walking out of Parliament for ``reasons of personal
sensitivity,'' Papapandreou said he could accept political
responsibility for the scandal but not criminal charges.
   Petsos, who was not a candidate in the June election, told
Parliament Tuesday that Papandreou was responsible for accusations
he _ Petsos _ had accepted bribes from Koskotas in return for
ordering state companies to deposit funds in his bank when it began
encountering cash flow problems.
   Tsovolas also addressed Parliament on Tuesday. He claimed the
charges against him were a frameup because he refused to bow to
pressure exerted by foreign and Greek special interest groups.
   Koutsogiorgas, who was dropped by the party as a candidate in
the last election, told the lawmakers shortly before they voted
that he had not committed any wrongdoing and denied taking a $2
million bribe from Koskotas reportedly desposited in a Swiss bank
account.
   Papandreou's socialist administration was succeeded by a
conservative-leftist coalition government after national elections
in June resulted in a hung Parliament. The government has vowed to
send those involved in scandals to special courts before holding
new elections by Nov. 5.
   With the governing coalition controlling 173 seats it appeared
certain when the debate started that the accused would be indicted.
   This is the second indictment against Papandreou, who was
referred to a special court last week for allegedly instigating
widespread illegal wiretapping of friends and political opponents
while in office.
   It was the first time in Greece's history that a political
civilian leader was ordered to stand trial for alleged wrongdoing
in office.
   The special court is not expected to hear the two cases until
mid-November. This raises the possibility that Papandreou will be
running for office in the next election while under indictment.
   Koskotas fled to the United States last November after a central
bank audit at the Bank of Crete uncovered the embezzlement scheme.
   The 35-year-old fugitive, in interviews from his Salem, Mass.,
prison cell where he is fighting extradition to Greece, claimed
Papandreou blackmailed him into embezzling funds for the benefit of
his party.
   According to a constitutional amendment passed by the 1967-74
military dictatorship, government officials can only be tried by a
13-member special tribunal made up of Supreme Court judges and
Appeals Court presidents.
   The indictments must be made by Parliament, acting on the
recommendation of an inquiry conducted by deputies, in the
parliamentary period immediately following the one in which the
crimes were allegedly committed.

   Vice President Dan Quayle said
Thursday that the Philippines accepted a call for new talks on the
future of U.S. military bases and expressed hope that a new pact
will provide ``for a longtime stay'' here.
   ``I now have a letter from President (Corazon) Aquino responding
to a letter I delivered on the behalf of President Bush in my
possession,'' Quayle told reporters during a visit to the
Corregidor battlefield.
   ``The letter is a positive letter. We will commence negotiations
and discussions on the future of the facilities here in the
Philippines. I am confident we will come to a mutually acceptable
agreement. I am also hopeful that that mutually acceptable
agreement will provide for a longtime stay by the United States.''
   The talks are expected to begin in December. The lease on the
six U.S. bases expires in September 1991 and opposition to them is
growing among Filipinos, who see the facilities as an infringement
on national sovereignty.
   Quayle was to depart later Thursday for Malaysia.
   On Wednesday, police hurled tear gas to disperse 2,000 leftists
demonstrating against Quayle and the U.S. bases.
   His visit was also marked by the killing of two American
civilians near a U.S. base hours before he arrived from Japan on
Tuesday. Police suspect communist rebels were responsible.
   Quayle pledged that the ambush-slayings would not drive
Americans from the Philippines and said a majority of Filipinos
want the bases to remain.
   ``Let me be direct: terrorists will not drive Americans from the
Philippines,'' he told U.S. troops and dependents at Clark Air Base
and the Subic Bay naval base, the largest of the six American
installations here.
   Police fired tear gas after demonstrators refused to end an
anti-base rally near the presidential palace. Riot police also
drove back hundreds of others who tried to march to the main gate
at Clark during Quayle's appearance.
   Police arrested 157 people for joining anti-Quayle rallies in
the capital.
   Quayle met for about an hour with Mrs. Aquino early Wednesday
and gave her a letter from Bush suggesting talks begin in December
on allowing the bases to remain.
   Mrs. Aquino's executive secretary, Catalino Macaraig, said the
government had agreed to the talks and would give Quayle formal
notice before he leaves.
   Any agreement on extending the bases' lease must be ratified by
two-thirds of the 23-member Senate, where opposition to the bases
is strong.
   Mrs. Aquino, who is to visit Washington in November, has refused
to say whether she will support a lease extension. She told Quayle
she did not want to discuss the bases in detail during her visit,
officials said.
   In 1985, Mrs. Aquino signed a manifesto calling for closing the
bases in a move to solidify the opposition against Ferdinand
Marcos, who was the Philippine president at that time. But after
taking office in 1986, Mrs. Aquino said she would keep her options
open.
   During a courtesy call on Senate President Jovito Salonga,
Quayle urged senators to ``remove the emotionalism'' from
discussions about the bases.
   Quayle asked him to consider the security and economic impact of
the bases, Salonga said. The installations provide jobs to about
70,000 Filipinos and pay more than $96 million annually in civilian
salaries.
   Quayle also said he and Mrs. Aquino discussed the killing of the
two Americans and the murder Tuesday of an officer from Mrs.
Aquino's guard force. ``President Aquino and I agreed that these
killings were unfortunately timed for my visit,'' he said. ``But we
also agreed that this would not drive a wedge between our two
countries, that our countries will have a special relationship.''
   In response to the killings, U.S. officials banned non-essential
travel between bases by the 40,000 American troops, civilian
employees and military dependents in the Philippines.
   After meetings with Mrs. Aquino and other officials, Quayle flew
to Subic 50 miles northwest of Manila and to Clark, 50 miles north
of the capital, before returning for a state banquet.
   At Clark, he met briefly with the widow of William H. Thompson,
45, one of the slain Americans. Officials said the widow of the
other American, Donald G. Buchner, 44, was eight months pregnant
and too distraught to attend.
   The victims, who were ambushed in their car, were civilian
contract employees at Camp O'Donnell, an Air Force station near
Clark. Local officials said both had lived in the area about two
years.
   The two were employees of Ford Aerospace Corp., which contracts
to maintain an electronic warfare training range at Camp O'Donnell.
The camp was used by the Japanese as a prison for American and
Filipino survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March.

   A sightseeing plane making its final
approach for landing veered into a wooded hill near the Grand
Canyon Airport on Wednesday, killing 10 people and injuring the
other 11 people aboard, eight critically.
   The aircraft's wings were sheared off by tall Ponderosa pines
but some passengers survived because the fuselage of the de
Havilland DHC-6 Twin Otter remained largely intact, said Coconino
County Sheriff Joe Richards. The two crew members were killed, he
said.
   National Park Service Ranger Paul Crawford, who was among the
first to reach the wreckage, said some of the passengers were
walking around when he arrived at the scene on a small ridge about
300 yards east of a runway.
   ``They were shellshocked. They had that empty, dazed look,'' he
said.
   The twin-engine Grand Canyon Airlines plane was on its second
flight of the day and making its final approach to the airport when
the accident occurred, said Ronald L. Warren, the airline's vice
president and general manager. He said it was cleared for landing.
   ``Preliminary reports indicate the aircraft touched down
normally on the runway, became airborne again, and veered to the
east side of the airport,'' he said.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elly Brekke said the
plane was about 1,500 feet down the 9,000-foot runway when it
veered to the right, then to the left and into an open space where
it descended into trees and crashed, flipping over.
   Warren said the plane had left the airport at 9 a.m. for the
one-hour scenic flight, which covers about 100 miles, and was on
schedule for its arrival when it crashed at about 9:55 a.m.
   All 19 passengers were Americans, he said. Several were from
California and many were from the East Coast. Two of the dead were
Modesto, Calif., City Councilman John Sutton and his wife, Donna,
said Modesto Mayor Carol Whiteside.
   The airport is located about five miles south of the Grand
Canyon. Ten of the injured were taken by ambulance, airplane and
helicopter to the Flagstaff Medical Center about 75 miles away.
   The injured suffered fractures, lacerations and head wounds,
said hospital spokeswoman Ann Hartman-Kolacky. Eight were listed in
critical condition and two were stable. The 11th person wasn't
brought to the hospital, apparently because the injuries weren't
that bad, she said.
   Warren said the pilot was in his mid-40s and had worked for the
airline for 4{ years. He said the pilot was also a training officer
and ``accustomed to handling unusual occurances, unusual events.
That was his job, and to teach others to handle them.''
   The co-pilot was in his mid-20s and in his first season with the
airline, Warren said. Both crew members were from Tusayan.
   The sheriff's office was to release additional information on
passengers pending notification of relatives.
   Larry Nickey, a Grand Canyon National Park Fire Department
captain, said there was fuel in the plane's cockpit area but the
wreckage did not catch fire. ``It's just good luck that we didn't
have a fire,'' Richards said.
   Nickey said firefighters cut out the plane's bottom to free a
man and a woman. He said they were the only two still alive in the
plane when he arrived.
   A National Transportation Safety Board investigation team was
not expected to reach the airport until late Wednesday. Richards
said the plane ``possibly had a power failure or may have struck a
power line.''
   A small brushfire was caused by a downed power line but it was
not known if the plane hit the line as it crashed.
   Warren said the craft, manufactured in 1975, had been owned and
operated by the airline for two years. He said the aircraft had no
history of any kind of problems.
   No cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder was onboard
because the devices aren't required or even manufactured for that
type of aircraft, he said.
   At the time of the crash, winds were calm and visibility was not
a problem although the sky was partly cloudy, Richards said.
   Gary Mucho, NTSB regional director, said the plane normally is
configured to carry 19 passengers and two crew members.
   In 1986, a Grand Canyon Airlines plane collided with a
sightseeing helicopter inside the canyon, killing 25 people. In
August 1983, 10 people died when a sightseeing charter plan from
Las Vegas smashed into a cliff near the canyon's South Rim. A
crash-investigation report said the pilot encountered rough weather
and could not climb out of the canyon.
   In Washington, NTSB spokesman Mike Benson said the de Havilland
Twin Otter is a popular commuter plane that carries 20 passengers.
   He said the model has been involved in 77 accidents since 1962,
including 25 that killed a total of 135 people. Over the same
period, the board lists 89 accidents at the Grand Canyon, including
28 that resulted in 105 fatalities.

   Federal aviation officials gave final approval
Wednesday to a $2.3 billion new Denver airport and signed a $60
million grant to help launch construction of the huge facility on
the plains northeast of Denver.
   Crews were expected to begin work this week at the site 18 miles
from downtown. The groundbreaking would mark the end of a long
struggle by Denver officials that included a citywide referendum in
May and battles with the city's major airlines.
   Federal Aviation Administrator James Busey said the complex,
scheduled to open in 1993, will remove a ``major bottleneck'' from
the aviation system.
   That bottleneck is Denver's Stapleton airport, which is reduced
to one runway during bad weather and can cause traffic to backed up
at airports that feed flights through it from around the country.
   Busey said the new airport, to be built 18 miles northeast of
downtown Denver, will be the nation's third busiest by 2000 in both
number of flights and passengers. Stapleton currently ranks fifth.
   The new airport would handle 817,000 takeoffs and landings and
board 33.2 million passengers a year, Busey said. It will open with
five runways and expand to 12 by 2020.
   ``Replacing Stapleton with a new all-weather airport not only
will benefit Denver but also will promote more efficient traffic
flows nationwide,'' the FAA chief said.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner noted that the airport
will be the first major complex since the Dallas Fort-Worth Airport
was opened in 1974.
   The grant for Denver is to be used to reimburse cost of
obtaining the land and to fund relocation assistance, terminal
building design and initial site preparation for the main terminal
area and an east-west runway, FAA officials said.
   The grant followed Federal Aviation Administration approval of a
final environmental impact statement for the new airport, marking a
formal federal go-ahead for the project. Environmental study of the
site took two years.
   Denver voters approved the airport in a referendum earlier this
year.

   President Bush urged governors at an
education summit Wednesday to forge fundamental changes to rescue
the nation's troubled schools, but was told in return the federal
government must spend more if that goal is to be reached.
   ``We've got to challenge the education system if we're to meet
the challenge of educational excellence,'' Bush told the governors
in a pep talk that opened the nation's first educational conference
between a president and the states' executives.
   All agreed that help is needed for a national school system
wracked by drugs, high dropout rates and mediocrity. But behind
closed doors Bush and members of his Cabinet heard what they did
not want to hear: that the federal government's commitment has to
grow.
   ``If they would give us a 5-year-old that is healthy and alert,
the system would be much more productive,'' said Republican Gov.
Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico.
   The summit scene was the historic campus of the University of
Virginia, whose establishment was the proudest accomplishment of
Thomas Jefferson _ America's first ``education president.'' The
university is still called ``Mr. Jefferson's school'' and Bush
referred to it that way, too.
   Bush dined with the governor's at Jefferson's famous home,
Monticello, atop a nearby mountain. A fife and drum corps played
and soldiers in colonial costume bearinhg the flags of the states
lined the walkway to the main entrance, where Bush and his wife,
Barbara, stood in a receiving line that passed the diners through
the building into the back yard.
   An Army band played swing tunes for the guests at rose- and
orchid-bedecked tables beneath a large tent.
   Governors circulated a memo outlining their own goals. Their
plan called for eliminating illiteracy, curtailing the dropout rate
and making American students the equal of their counterparts
anywhere in the world, especially in mathematics and science.
   After the first round of meetings, there was sharp and sarcastic
criticism of some of the governors from William Bennett, Bush's
drug policy coordinator who served as secretary of education in the
Reagan Administration.
   Bennett told reporters that in addition to ``a couple of feisty
exchanges about education and defense spending ... there was pap _
standard Democratic pap. There was standard Republican pap. ...''
   Added Bennett: ``Much of the discussion took place in total
absence of any knowledge of what works or what's effective in the
actual experience of school. ... Some people were saying things
that other people had written for them, and they were reading them
out of books and reading them off cards.''
   One governor trying to make a point by comparing military and
education spending was Democrat Mario Cuomo of New York.
   ``You spent over $300 billion on missiles that you'll never
fire,'' he said in an interview on the Cable News Network,
addressing his remarks to the Republicans. ``Now the American
people are saying, `OK, a few less missiles because we don't need
them as much anymore. A little more money on education.' I think
the people will understand that.''
   Carruthers of New Mexico was one of several who raised the point
about early childhood programs, and said Bush was urged to cut
federal regulations.
   He said the president was told at one closed-door session: ``Let
us do it our own way. We will demonstrate that we're doing it
better.''
   Bennett, discussing that session, said there was ``lots of talk
about early childhood. Everyone agreed they like little children.''
   But he said that unless educators concerned themselves about
poor schools in later grades, more money for early childhood
programs would be a waste.
   ``It's time to get on with it,'' said Bush, challenging the
governors to do more than just study the issues and to act without
partisanship.
   One plan pushed by the administration and welcomed by a number
of governors would allow parents to shop around for schools,
sending youngsters to the ones they think will educate best.
   ``This is a mechanism that's very, very important,'' Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos said in an interview. ``I've called it the
cornerstone for restructuring.''
   He said he would begin a whirlwind tour in mid-October to sell
the idea to educators in states including North Carolina, Colorado
and California, conducting hearings during the day and meeting with
working parents at night.
   Before leaving Washington, Bush told reporters that he was
loking for commitment from the governors ``to make those
fundamental changes that are needed if we are going to improve
educational performance.''
   Controversy over federal spending rumbled just below the
surface, but a number of governors said it would not be a major
issue at the meeting. Bush said he was not prepared to ``quintuple
spending.''
   Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a Democrat, conceded, ``We do not
expect a big increase in federal funding to flow out of this
summit.'
   Arriving to join his Cabinet, his wife and the governors in a
day and a half of meetings, Bush deplored the state of the nation's
schooling.
   ``Millions of Americans cannot read, some never even make it to
graduation, dropping out of school and society as well,'' he said.
``Drugs have invaded our classrooms, violence has entered our
schoolyards, and clearly the enlightened America dreamed of by
Thomas Jefferson still eludes us.''
   ``We must decide on a course of action; the time for study is
now over,'' Bush said.
   A consensus appeared to form quickly around a need for
``national performance goals'' under which every school's
performance could be measured against every other school in the
country.
   ``I think we will establish the fact that we need measurable
national goals,'' Bush said, and some governors were making the
same point.
   The summit was called in fulfillment of Bush's pledge during his
presidential campaign to become ``the education president.''
   Education has taken on new urgency since then with warnings from
businessmen that schools are not turning out graduates capable of
competing with their foreign counterparts in Japan or Germany at a
time when reasoning power becomes an ever more important on-the-job
skill.
   Critics cite statistics suggesting American youngsters are not
keeping pace. One study, comparing U.S. students with those of
other countries, put the Americans 10th in eighth-grade arithmetic,
12th in algebra and 16th in geometry. Census figures show about a
fifth of Americans age 18 to 24 lack high school diplomas.

<HEAD>Executives Said to Have Lied, Cheated to Get Postal Service Work</HEAD>

   Two top officers at a Dallas company cheated,
lied, stole and covered up in an attempt to win a $400 million
postal service contract to build mail-sorting equipment, a federal
prosecutor said Wednesday.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Valder said Recognition Equipment
Inc., its chief executive officer and marketing vice president were
involved in a scheme to ``defraud the government by buying'' Peter
Voss, a former member of the postal service's board of governors.
   The two REI officers are William Moore and Robert Reedy.
   In opening statements at the non-jury trial, the prosecutor said
REI paid $325,000 to Detroit-area businessman John Gnau in 1985 and
early 1986 in an attempt to win work with the postal service.
   Gnau funneled some of the money to Voss, who as vice chairman of
the postal board of governors had urged Moore and Reedy to hire
Gnau as a consultant in the fall of 1984.
   REI lawyer Jack Cooney responded that no one at the company knew
of the arrangement between Gnau and Voss.
   The conspiracy between Voss and Gnau ``was up and running and
profitable before REI was contacted,'' said Cooney. ``REI was
victimized. REI was one of many companies this conspiracy tried to
seduce.''
   But Valder said the company ``polluted'' and tried to
``capture'' the postal service procurement process, and Moore was
``obsessed'' with getting a postal contract for the company.
   Moore and Reedy ``cheated ... they lied ... they stole ... they
covered up,'' Valder said.
   The charges of conspiracy, theft and fraud are being tried
before U.S. District Court Judge George Revercomb.
   Moore and Reedy participated in an arrangement that has been
``around since the beginning of time,'' Valder said. The defendants
were ``trying to buy a government official.''
   Valder said Moore's own notes refer to Gnau's firm at one point
by saying, ``consultant wired,'' adjacent to a notation reading,
``Peter Voss.''
   But the prosecutor acknowledged there will be no evidence that
Gnau, Voss or their associates ever specifically told REI or its
officers of the corrupt arrangement.
   ``Valder hangs his case on words like `wired''' which connote no
illegality, Cooney said.
   Other companies had hired high-profile lobbyists such as former
White House political director Lyn Nofziger, Cooney said, and ``a
lot of people would think those people were wired.''
   Voss, who headed Ronald Reagan's 1980 Ohio presidential
campaign, received a four-year sentence in 1986 after pleading
guilty to taking an illegal gratuity and to expense account fraud.
The gratuity from Gnau was in connection with REI's attempt to get
postal service work.
   Gnau, who headed Reagan's 1980 Michigan campaign, was sentenced
to three years for conspiracy and paying an illegal $2,500 gratuity
to Voss.
   Both men are expected to testify as government witnesses at the
trial, which could last several months.
   Valder said evidence will be presented showing that:
   _Reedy asked one of Gnau's business partners, ``Why don't you
get Voss to go sole-source?'' by awarding a non-competitive
contract to REI.
   _Moore and Reedy worked with Voss through Gnau associate William
Spartin to get rid of U.S. postmaster general Paul Carlin and
replace him with someone sympathetic to REI.
   _Spartin, under contract with the postal board of governors,
asked Moore to suggest replacements and Moore's first choice was Al
Casey, who quickly was selected by the board.
   But Cooney said a tape recording of the meeting in which Carlin
was fired shows the board of governors voted 6-0 to dismiss him
because he was a poor manager.

   Israeli leftists and Jewish settlers wrangled
over the Palestinian issue in a nationally televised debate
Wednesday during which settlers shunned one of their rabbis for
meeting a Palestinian activist.
   The debate, on Israel Television's Moked (Focus) program, was
broadcast from Kfar Etzion in the occupied West Bank after another
settlement refused to act as host for Rabbi Menachem Froman, the
television said.
   Several settler leaders refused to sit next to Froman during the
hourlong show to show their wrath over his Sept. 19 meeting with
Feisal Husseini, a Palestinian jailed twice during the 21-month-old
Arab uprising.
   ``Husseini is responsible for the bloodshed taking place today
in the land of Israel. It's improper to shake his hand,'' said
Hanan Porat, a National Religious Party legislator.
   Israeli leftists often meet moderate Palestinians. But Froman,
of Tekoah settlement in the West Bank, is the first settler leader
to meet a Palestinian activist.
   Froman advocates a grass-roots dialogue led by religious
figures. His ideas include a state run by Israelis and Palestinians
together.
   His five-hour secret conversation with Husseini has split the
70,000-strong settler community, which mainly supports annexation
of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Militant settlers have demanded Froman be removed from his post
at Tekoah, which he has held for 11 years, or even jailed. But some
settler moderates said his initiative reflects a growing readiness
to compromise.
   ``We should fight our enemies,'' said Froman, ``but we should
make an effort to explore the possibility of this enemy ceasing to
be an enemy.''
   But some settlers accused Froman of fueling the uprising by
meeting Husseini, who they said was a rebellion organizer. At least
574 Arabs and 40 Israelis have died in the violence.
   ``After all those years ... we have some opening,'' left-wing
writer and journalist Hanoch Bartov complained, ``and people don't
want to hear, don't want to talk, don't want anything.''
   Yohanan Ben-Yakov recalled the history of his Kfar Etzion
settlement, now a religious communal settlement 10 miles southwest
of Jerusalem that first was founded in 1932 and was destroyed in
the Arab riots of 1936.
   Re-established in 1943, Kfar Etzion was besieged and destroyed
again during Israel's 1948 War of Independence, but was founded
anew in 1967.
   ``The road you walk ... leads to a binational state now and to
an Arab state tomorrow,'' insisted Bartov, who had been a guard for
Jewish convoys that brought supplies and ammunition to the area in
1948.
   ``We now have 2 million Arabs and don't know what to do about
them, and even you are seeking a way for coexistence because the
present situation is unbearable,'' he said.
   A settler in the audience countered to applause:
   ``You oppose the idea of transferring Arabs, but support
transfer of people from here and Tekoah, uprooting them from their
place, from the land.''
   Left-wing activist Avishai Grossman intervened:
   ``If we choose life and not death and suicide, we should reach
an agreement, divide the land and give the Palestinians a
possibility of national expression.''
   Israelis called in during the show to complain people like
Grossman were ready to ``present this beautiful state ... to the
Arabs on a silver plate,'' and a Palestinian phoned from Gaza to
offer a territory-for-peace exchange.
   ``I only see Jews who want peace and a state that wants peace,''
noted an Israeli woman calling from Jerusalem. ``But I don't see
the Palestinian side, so there is no point in this debate.''

   The Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly
approved a $9.4 billion plan to pay for the war on drugs and called
for mandatory drug and alcohol testing of millions of
transportation workers in safety-senstive jobs.
   ``This proposal represents the strongest first step we can make
to win the war against drugs,'' Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said
as Senate voted 97-2 to couple the drug plan to an $11.9 billion
transportation bill.
   The Senate then passed the transportation bill 99-0 with the
drug plan attached and sent it to a House-Senate conference
committee.
   Also included in the transportation bill is a measure last week
that would ban smoking on all domestic airline flights.
   The drug plan represented a compromise produced in week-long
negotiations between the White House and senators of both parties.
   The negotiations began after Democrats sought to add $2.2
billion to the $7.9 billion war on drugs announced by President
Bush on Sept. 5 in a nationally televised address. They said the
administration's blueprint failed to earmark enough for prevention
and treatment.
   The compromise contains the $7.9 billion plus $400 million in
anticrime funds, $200 million for juvenile justice, $800 million in
additional prevention and treatment money and $100 million for law
enforcement grants. The additional funds would be gained through a
0.43 percent cut in federal spending.
   Before approving the transportation bill, the Senate attached on
a voice vote a provision offered by Sen. John C. Danforth to
require drug and alcohol tests in the industry.
   It would require random, pre-employment, post-accident and
for-cause testing of an estimated 3,292,000 employees in
safety-senstive positions in the airline, rail, bus and trucking
industries.
   Danforth and a number of lawmakers have been pushing for several
years for testing of transportation workers, citing repeated fatal
accidents traced to employees under the influence of drugs and
alcohol. A measure applying only to rail workers is part of the
House version of the transportation bill.
   The Transportation Department said Tuesday 15,352 random drug
tests of its own employees during 16 months in 1988 and 1989 turned
up 99 indications of drug use, or 0.64 percent of those tested.
Seventeen tests of suspected users turned up eight positive
indications.
   The central transportation provisions of the bill call for $11.9
billion in new spending plus $15.9 billion in already collected
fuel and passenger taxes. The measure envisions $12.2 billion for
highways projects, $7.3 billion for aviation programs and $3
billion for mass transit assistance.
   Smoking already is banned on domestic airline flights of two
hours or less. The Senate measure would extend that to all flights.
   It was adopted last week over the objections of tobacco-state
senators.
   Voting against the $9.4 billion drug funding plan were
Republicans Jake Garn of Utah and Steve Symms of Idaho. Sen. Jim
Sasser, D-Tenn., did not vote. Not voting on the transportation
bill was Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo.
   Garn said in a statement the drug plan was the result of a
bidding war ``between the administration and Congress over who is
going to spend the most on drugs,'' and the cuts required elsewhere
would hurt valuable programs.
   Reaching for the advantage on the politically charged issue,
Democrats took credit for reshaping the measure.
   Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, said the Bush
administration proposal in its initial form was ``painfully
inadequate for the task that we face in this country in dealing
with drugs.''
   ``We have a chance to do something meaningful on the most
serious domestic problem we face and we are going to take that
action and dramatically improve the program that the president
proposed,'' Mitchell said.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said ``the president's
strategy is sound. ... We may nibble around the edges.''
   ``We're not going to whip this problem in one year, three years,
four years, let's find out what works,'' Dole said. ``We're going
to save a generation if we can. It may take a generation to do it.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, one of the GOP negotiators, noted
pointedly that the final addition to the program was
``substantially less than'' the initial amount Byrd had sought.
   The Senate is pushing to wrap up work on money bills for the
upcoming fiscal year. Once it does, lawmakers plan to take up a
bill that would put in place the non-money side of the war on
drugs, under an agreement between Democratic and Republican leaders.
   The agreement also calls for the Senate consideration this year
of additional components of the long-dormant Bush anti-crime bill,
such as extension of the death penalty to cover more offenses,
limits on the number of appeals prisoners may file and an easing of
the rules of evidence that would favor prosecutors.

   A renewed fight over the teaching of
evolution and creationism in California will have a crucial test
this week in a battle that has national implications.
   The focal point is the upcoming adoption of a new science
curriculum framework, a detailed statement of what should be taught
in California and how it should be taught.
   The framework doesn't mandate course content, which is
determined by the state's 1,030 local school boards, but it sets
standards and goals that historically have been nearly as effective
as mandates.
   In 1985, California education authorities drew national
attention by successfully demanding that publishers devote more
space to evolution. The revised textbooks are now being used in
schools across the nation.
   The new proposal would strengthen the teaching of evolution.
   If adopted, it would be a ``national victory for science over
dogma,'' said Michael Hudson, western states director for the
Washington-based People for the American Way, a 270,000-member
advocacy group for civil and constitutional liberty issues.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze has hailed President Bush's call for the superpowers
to destroy most of their chemical weapons, but says Washington
should go further and agree to stop making all types of poison gas.
   In his speech Tuesday to the General Assembly, Shevardnadze also
challenged the United States to join the Soviets in halting all
nuclear tests and ending the production of weapons-grade plutonium
and uranium.
   Shevardnadze's address was a rapid reply to Bush's offer, in a
speech to the assembly on Monday, to cut U.S. chemical weapons
stockpiles by 80 percent if the Soviets reduce their arsenal to the
same level.
   The Soviet envoy said Moscow is ready to join the United States
and ``radically reduce or completely destroy'' all its chemical
weapons even before an international treaty is adopted.

   Vice President Dan Quayle called
today for talks on U.S. military bases, which many Filipinos want
removed, and said the murder of two Americans would not ``drive a
wedge'' between Washington and Manila.
   Quayle spoke a day after suspected Communist guerrillas ambushed
and killed two American civilians who were working near a U.S. base
north of the capital.
   In response, U.S. officials today banned non-essential travel
between bases by the 40,000 American troops, civilian employees and
military dependents in the Philippines.
   The attack occurred shortly before Quayle arrived to discuss
extending the leases of the six U.S. military installations, among
the largest such bases outside the continental United States.

   A genetic abnormality that appears to play a
role in many common cancers has been solidly linked to lung cancer,
raising hopes of improved diagnosis and treatment, scientists say.
   Researchers examining lung cancer tumors discovered a series of
abnormalities in the so-called p53 anti-cancer gene, according to a
report Tuesday by Dr. John Minna of the National Cancer
Institute-Navy Medical Oncology Branch in Bethesda, Md.
   Defects in the gene also have been linked to colon cancer, to an
uncommon bone cancer called osteogenic sarcoma and to chronic
myelogenous leukemia, Minna said.
   ``Obviously, everybody is going to be looking for it in
everything else,'' Minna said.

   The biggest sales spree at many leading department stores is
taking place in the boardroom rather than at the counters as some
of the nation's premier retailing names are up for grabs.
   Swanky Saks Fifth Avenue and venerable Marshall Field's became
the latest to go on the block when their parent company, BAT
Industries PLC, announced a major realignment Tuesday.
   The British conglomerate will sacrifice its American retail
holdings and hold on to its lucrative tobacco and financial
services businesses as part of a plan to defend itself from a $22
billion takeover charge led by Anglo-French financier Sir James
Goldsmith.
   Trend-setting Bloomingdale's has been on the market for several
weeks due to the financial difficulties of its debt-encumbered
owner, Campeau Corp. The Canadian holding company also might be
forced to part with other pieces of its vast retail store
collection.
   If high-fashion isn't to everyone's tastes, May Department
Stores Co. wants to sell its Caldor and Venture discount chains.
   And if this wasn't a big enough selection, several U.S. stores
owned by Australia's troubled Hooker Corp. are on the market,
including the B. Altman &amp; Co. and Bonwit Teller chains.

<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 25 years of independence, the
Maltese are still having trouble reconciling political differences
that have kept them sharply divided, often with bloodshed _ or the
kind of turmoil that saw the armed forces cmmander thrown into the
sea.
   Partisan passions generally simmer near the boiling point on the
Mediterranean island nation, which has a history of foreign
domination going back about 2,000 years to the Phoenicians, Greeks,
Carthaginians, Romans, Saracens, Normans, Knights of Malta, French
and British.
   Political disputes are fierce and often argued with firearms.
   Most recently, the two major political parties could not get
together to mark the anniversary of independence gained from
Britain on Sept. 21, 1964.
   Socialist Party leaders boycotted the celebrations on grounds
that the governing Nationalist Party did not consult them about the
plans.
   National reconciliation is a much-discussed political issue that
so far has remained only talk.
   Party rivalry is bitter, enduring and often violent.
   Leo Brincat, a Socialist Party official, maintains that the
single biggest failure of Prime Minister Edward Fenech Adami's
2-year-old conservative government is its inability to bring about
national reconciliation.
   ``It makes a mockery of reconciliation,'' he said.
   The Nationalists, in turn, blame the Socialists for the partisan
fighting and for the outbreaks of political violence and
hooliganism that it inspires.
   ``I think the political leadership in the opposition party
believes that an attitude of reconciliation could be considered by
several of its followers as a capitulation,'' said Deputy Prime
Minister Guido De Marco.
   In June, several hundred Socialist supporters violently
disrupted the wedding, attended by the prime minister, of the
daughter of a prominent Nationalist Party politician.
   Police said 29 people were injured, including 10 policemen by
gunfire, when police clashed with the crowd that shouted insults at
the bride and pelted her with garbage and rabbit skins outside the
church. Rabbit skins apparently were used because one of the prime
minister's names, Fenech, means rabbit in Maltese.
   On March 31, Brig. John Spitieri was overpowered by a mob as he
took the salute at the Freedom Day parade, hit on the head with his
ceremonial sword and tossed into the sea.
   That unceremonial dunking of the armed forces commander was
typical of the turbulent nature of politics on this rocky,
sun-baked island of 340,000 people.
   At least 20 people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds after
clashes at rallies that preceeded the razor-thin 1987 election
victory for Fenech Adami and his conservative party. One
Nationalist Party activist was shot to death at a party clubhouse
in what colleagues called a political murder.
   After the election, Fenech Adami immediately began to alter the
course the Socialists set for Malta during their 16 years at the
helm. He moved the country away from the Soviet Union and Libya and
closer to the United States and the European Economic Community.
   He scratched a clause from the preamble of a 1981 treaty with
the Soviet Union that said Malta would consult with Moscow in case
of a threat to peace and quickly scrapped part of a 1984 treaty
with Libya that called for an exchange of military and security
information.
   Former Maltese officials have said that a half-hour before the
U.S. air raids on Libya in April 1986, Maltese air traffic
controllers warned Libya that the warplanes were en route.
   Fenech Adami has said Malta wants to retain friendly relations
with Libya, which lies 87 miles to the south, and intends to
renegotiate the 1984 friendship treaty with Libya that expires in
November. But his government is looking to the West to help its
sagging economy.
   The government is seeking full membership in the European
Economic Community and has liberalized its tax laws in an effort to
lure foreign investment.
   Socialists complain that the conservatives are simply
compromising Malta's treasured neutrality and constitutionally
mandated commitment to non-alignment. They also assail the
conservatives' economic approach.
   Deputy Prime Minister De Marco acknowledges that there has been
no rush of foreign investment but says such things take time.
   Some foreign companies have come to Malta, but not nearly as
many as the conservatives had hoped.
   One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Maltese disappointment in the response stems from unrealistic
expectations. Western governments, he said, are pleased with
Malta's new direction. But in free market economies that pleasure
does not translate directly into investment, he said.
   ``The 25 years as an independent nation have taught us many
lessons,'' said De Marco. ``The greatest of them all is that it is
good to have friends, but rely on yourself.''

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are breathing a bit
easier here in Mexico's third largest city, even though noxious
gases still spew from buses, industrial smoke stains the sky,
rivers foam with waste and bulldozers uproot trees to make room for
mansions.
   In the past months authorities in the state of Nuevo Leon have
taken the most serious steps toward preserving the eroding
environment since 1939, when the 600,000-acre Cumbres de Monterrey
National Park was established in an arc west and south of the city.
   ``Ecology protection appears to be coming into vogue in
Mexico,'' said Roberto Ortiz, a member of the Monterrey Ecology
Movement. ``There's more civic awareness and the interest of the
authorities, even by the president of Mexico, is more notable.''
   To start, the state expropriated nearly 4,500 acres of land on a
pine-covered ridge called Chipinque and turned it over to the
public. It was land that already supposedly belonged to the
national park but had been parceled out to private buyers anyway.
   Then, on Aug. 25, Nuevo Leon's first ecology preservation law
went into effect.
   The law, one of only three state environmental protection acts
in the country, promises to fine or close down polluting
industries, take polluting cars and buses off the road, create
waste dumps, improve drainage and start environmental awareness
programs.
   Local authorities were motivated by fears that Monterrey's
ecological problems could reach the proportions of Mexico City, one
of the most crowded and polluted cities in the world, said Elida
Rizzo, state ecology director.
   ``The environment just can't be ignored any longer,'' she said.
``We have do do something now or never.''
   But the sticking point for anti-pollution laws in Mexico,
however well-intended, has usually been enforcement.
   ``If the ecology law is applied with the spirit in which it was
written than there's hope,'' said Luis Sepulveda, a member of the
environmental group Long Live Chipinque. ``But if it's compromised
by politics then it'll end up like all the other laws in Mexico
that were made to be violated.''
   A chief problem is Mexico's poverty: anti-pollution efforts are
not the top priority for officials focused on creating jobs and
restarting an economy that has been stagnant for six years.
   ``We don't want there to be a witch hunt against us,'' said
Armando Rodriguez, legal director for the Monterrey Chamber of
Industry. ``If the government acts drastically it could close maybe
50 percent of the plants in Monterrey.''
   About 150 miles south of Texas' Rio Grande Valley, Monterrey is
northern Mexico's largest, most industrialized and wealthiest city.
Nearly 3 million people live in the metropolitan area, about 75
percent of Nuevo Leon's population.
   At one time it also was one of the north's most beautiful
communities, nestled in the shadows of 7,500-foot peaks and
bisected by the rippling Santa Catarina River.
   But rapid industrialization and urbanization _ Monterrey had
just 130,000 residents in 1930 _ helped turn the Santa Catarina
into a dusty channel as demands for its water increased.
   Ecology director Rizzo said Monterrey households create nearly
900,000 tons of garbage a year. Industry produces 1.5 million tons
of waste annually, much of it toxic, but the state got its first
industrial waste dump just last year.
   Mexico has had several federal environmental protection laws,
the newest 7 months old, and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
has promised a serious fight against the problem. In Mexico City,
new rules requiring that vehicles stay off the road one working day
in five are due to go into effect Nov. 1.
   But while lead emissions are a major cause of air pollution in
the cities, cars still use leaded gasoline.
   Ecologists lauded the seizure of Chipinque.
   ``The expropriation indicates that at least an effort is being
made to save what nature gave us,'' said Sepulveda.
   The Nuevo Leon law, said Rizzo, ``gives us more power and allows
us to take quicker action.''
   The new law gives the state the power to levy fines of up to
20,000 times the daily minimum wage, now about $3.50 a day, and
prison terms of up to five years. So far no enforcement action has
been taken as the state organizes an environmental commission and
prepares impact studies.
   Two major polluters _ an oil refinery and the power authority _
are owned by the federal government, but Rizzo promises the state
law will be enforced ``against all polluters'' and will show
positive results ``within five years.''

<HEAD>Congress Working to Undo Tax Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tax reform is an idea whose time has come, and
gone, with some frequency. Right now it is going, piece by piece,
as Congress works toward reviving tax breaks the reformers scrapped
as loopholes just three years ago.
   The rival tax plans that are being pushed by Republicans and
Democrats each involve tax preferences that were eliminated in the
1986 law that was to have been the landmark of lasting reform.
There had been some tinkering, but now the proposals for change
involve major features of the law President Reagan hailed as the
prize in ``the world series of tax reform.''
   One is the capital gains tax break President Bush campaigned
for, and squeezed through the House Ways and Means Committee with
the help of Democrats who broke with their party's leaders. The
other is an across-the-board deduction for Individual Retirement
Accounts, ruled out for upper income taxpayers under the 1986
overhaul, now the Democratic counter to the Bush plan.
   The tax issue is one of the few that really was presented to the
voters in the campaign of 1988, in Bush's daily promises that there
would be no increase, and in his call for reduction of the tax on
capital gains realized from the sale of stocks, real estate and
other assets. He said that would spur investment and help create
jobs. Then as now, the Democrats denounced the proposal as a tax
break for the rich.
   In Congress, Democratic leaders argue that the measure to reduce
the tax on capital gains undoes one of the central compromises that
opened the way for enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader,
said the essential tradeoff was that tax deductions and tax breaks
like the lower rate for capital gains were dropped in exchange for
reductions in income tax rates. He said the Republicans now want to
keep the rates but restore one of the tax breaks.
   The bill they now favor would reduce the effective capital gains
tax to a maximum 19.6 percent for the next two years, which is just
about where it was before the 1986 tax bill eliminated special
treatment for capital gains and made it subject to income tax rates
which now range up to 33 percent.
   ``That strikes at the heart of tax reform,'' Gephardt said.
   Then again, the Individual Retirement Account deduction was
restricted as part of the same tax reform deal. One of the 1986
changes was to eliminate that deduction for taxpayers whose joint
returns showed income over $50,000 a year.
   So, while the Democrats complain that Bush wants a tax break for
the rich, most of direct benefits of either proposal would go to
people high on the income ladder.
   Democrats want to finance the retirement account deduction by
boosting the top rate for the wealthiest taxpayers to 33 percent.
That would affect about 600,000 taxpayers who now pay top rates of
28 percent although people with slightly lower incomes already are
at the higher rate. Bush says that would be a tax increase and he'd
veto it, in keeping with his campaign vow.
   Either formula runs counter to the premise of the 1986 reformers
that tax laws should be written to raise revenues, rather than to
determine how people use their own money. That, and the drive to
keep total revenues at their pre-reform levels while rates were
being slashed, led to the wholesale elimination of tax deductions
and shelters.
   The next step in the cycle, it seems, is to start putting some
back.
   As the process unfolds, lines are being drawn on an issue that
will resound in the 1990 congressional election campaigns, as it
has in the last four presidential elections.
   The Democrats only won one, with Jimmy Carter, who said his
advocacy of tax reform was one of the reasons he won in 1976.
Carter campaigned for a complete overhaul of the income tax system,
calling it ``a disgrace to the human race.'' In the next three
elections, Republican candidates used the tax issue effectively in
defeating Democrats they said were bent on raising taxes.
   That's a script Republicans hope to use again, in state and
congressional elections.

   ``Middle-Aged Person Makes Early Withdrawals
From IRA and Pays No Penalty!''
   Maybe that will never make it as a headline at the supermarket
checkout stand. But it is a feat that can be accomplished in real
life, quite possible to your financial benefit, without breaking
the law.
   As millions of Americans opened individual retirement accounts
in recent years, they were cautioned that they were tying up their
money until the year in which they reached age 59{.
   Any withdrawals from the account before then, except in cases of
death or disability, are hit with a 10 percent penalty tax in
addition to ordinary income tax.
   However, there is ``a little-known, poorly understood exception
to this rule,'' says the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick.
   People of any age can withdraw money from an IRA provided they
do so under a system that provides for roughly equal periodic
payments based on their life expectancies.
   To see how this works in practice, consider this example
provided by accountants Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells:
   A 50-year-old woman wants to start tapping a $250,000 IRA in
which she has stashed a lump-sum payment from a former employer.
   She consults the current tables published by the Internal
Revenue Service (available at her library, perhaps, or her bank),
and determines that her statistical life expectancy is 33.1 years.
   Dividing $250,000 by 33.1, she calculates that she can withdraw
$7,553 this year, subject to income taxes but no penalty.
   When it comes time to make next year's withdrawal, she will
recompute how much she is entitled to, based on the remaining
balance in her IRA and the latest life-expectancy tables.
   Chances are the balance will be a bit more than $250,000 then,
since she withdrew only about 3 percent of her money this year and
can easily earn a higher interest rate on the remaining amount in
the account.
   If she wants to gain access to more money in the early years of
her withdrawals, she can figure what is coming to her using an
``annuity'' formula that also is based on life expectancy but adds
an assumed future return on the capital she has invested.
   With an assumed return of 9 percent, she is entitled to a
penalty-free distribution of about $24,000 this year.
   Once you commit yourself to either approach, you must keep using
it faithfully until you reach age 59{ or more and have been taking
the distributions for at least five years.
   Fail to meet this requirement, and you are subject to something
called a ``recapture tax'' that amounts to a reimposition of all
the penalties you thought you had avoided.
   Now that you know how to do it, is it time to rush out and start
mining your IRA gold? Not without some careful consideration,
financial advisers say.
   ``As a general rule, most individuals should leave their IRA
balances intact at least until retirement,'' KPMG Peat Marwick says.
   After all, the point of most IRA saving is to accumulate a nest
egg specifically for the later years of your life, when you may
have less control over your financial circumstances than you did
before.
   Furthermore, the earlier you withdraw money from an IRA, the
less time it has to enjoy the potent benefits of tax-deferred
compounding.
   But the early withdrawal strategy may have appeal in special
situations _ for example, when you feel your retirement can be
secured from other sources, and you see an opportunity to put your
IRA money to work elsewhere. And it remains as an option for all
IRA savers should their needs change with time.

<TEXT>
   You don't have to have inside information or
economic insight to get a clear, concise and probably accurate
forecast of where the economy is going over the next few months.
   Just watch automobile sales.
   In order to benefit, you don't have to have plans to buy a car,
although discounts would indeed leave more money in your pocket.
Consider any discount a bonus and continue to watch the direction
of car sales in general.
   Should sales rise strongly, it could mean the economy has a
reserve of strength the Federal Reserve had not foreseen. Those
higher sales could carry the economy for several months. They also
might force borrowing costs higher.
   If sales lag, it would suggest an economy still cooling down
and, with recession always a threat, the lower sales might spur the
Federal Reserve into allowing interest rates to fall, thus giving a
lift to economic activity.
   The situation isn't unique. Car sales always are important,
being the biggest item in a consumer market that accounts for
two-thirds of the gross national product. But now those sales are
playing an unusually critical role.
   Will sales continue strong, as they have for several years, or
will they decline? Not even carmakers can say, but already they
have signaled their anxiety: General Motors has announced discounts
on its upcoming 1990 models, and others might follow.
   Never before has a company the size of GM raised prices on
products to be introduced, and then discounted prices on those
products before they reached the market.
   That is how uncertain the car market is _ and maybe the consumer
economy too.
   Should sales weaken, carmakers would be in a fix. They might be
forced to discount more deeply, and if that failed, they would be
forced into layoffs. Eventually, suppliers would have to do the
same.
   The impact would be huge. The effect of car sales penetrates the
entire economy, eventually showing up in areas that might seem to
have only a remote connection.
   That impact spreads through categories of industry _ wholesale
and retail, textiles, metals, mining, plastics, chemicals, rubber,
oil; through all levels of labor _ white collar, blue collar,
skilled, unskilled; and through every geographic region, bar none.
   That is why car sales are a measure of consumer sentiment and an
indicator of economic direction. They involve every residence from
the White House to your house.
   Seldom, however, are they afforded the high recognition of
stocks as an indicator of future economic developments. Stocks, it
is said, foretell the economy six months in advance, and there is
some supporting evidence.
   The big problem with the stock market, however, is that it has
evolved from a random selection of economic sentiment to a
marketplace dominated by like-thinking institutional buyers. It can
give false signals.
   Perhaps the most notorious of these alarms was the price
collapse of October 1987, bringing with it dire warnings of a
recession to come that didn't come.
   Researchers found a telling reason why: Too few Americans owned
stocks, and therefore weren't affected directly in the pocketbook.
Many of them didn't even follow the market.
   The same isn't true of car sales.

   Not satisfied with extended weekday hours,
Saturday hours and automated tellers open 24 hours, some banks are
crossing the once-unthinkable financial frontier of Sunday hours.
   It's well under way in Atlanta, and by November at least two
California banks plan to offer full service on Sundays, from new
accounts to home equity lines of credit. Most of the branches will
be located in a common Sunday stopping place: supermarkets.
   A smattering of other banks have also tried Sunday hours, the
latest strategy in a trend toward greater flexibility that began
with bank deregulation a decade ago.
   Since deregulation, banks have courted customers with everything
from free toasters to interest-bearing checking accounts to
Saturday hours.
   Weekend banking is ``acknowledging the fact that life in the
'80s ain't as simple as a couple of decades ago,'' said Nancy
Evans, spokeswoman for the California Bankers Association.
   ``Banks are finally learning they will have to be retailers.
They've been too conservative,'' said Jack Seefus, president and
chief executive of the six-branch Antelope Valley Bank, in the
desert 60 miles north of Los Angeles.
   All Seefus' branches already are open from 9 to 1 on Saturdays.
And they will stay open from 11 to 3 Sundays beginning in November,
a boon to the booming population of people who work in Los Angeles
but live in distant cities like Lancaster and Palmdale where
housing is cheaper.
   ``The demographics have changed so much. These commuters have
got to have a place to bank, and they don't pull into town until 6
or 6:30,'' Seefus said.
   ``This is just another type of convenience we're providing for
people,'' agreed Michael Wallace, executive vice president at
eight-branch Fremont Bank near San Francisco.
   Fremont has had Saturday hours at its regular branches for 20
years. It plans to open eight more that will be open from 11 to 5
on Sunday, beginning with two in November.
   Both banks are small _ Fremont has $220 million in assets,
Antelope Valley has $112 million.
   And both will tie their Sunday hours into another emerging
banking trend _ branches at supermarkets. The eight new Fremont
branches will be built inside Safeway stores in cities along the
east side of San Francisco Bay.
   Two Antelope Valley Bank mini-branches are already located in
markets, and Seefus hopes to add more.
   ``It's a very inexpensive way to expand your operations,'' he
said.
   ``People think only the consumer will use a bank like that in a
market,'' Seefus said. ``But that's not true. Businesses use those
little banks, too. The K mart in Mojave uses us. They come over to
the Stater Brothers market and do their banking.''
   Seefus won't be surprised if California's bigger banks
eventually open at least some branches on Sunday to keep their
smaller rivals from taking away customers.
   Elsewhere in the country, Georgia's Bank South (75 branches, $5
billion in assets), has tried Sunday banking over the past year at
its 31 branches in big Kroger stores in the Atlanta area.
   ``It has been very successful,'' said spokesman Bolling ``Bo''
Spalding.
   ``We were primarily a corporate bank, and now we're trying to
build a retail presence,'' Spalding said. ``We want to do that by
differentiating ourselves, being the most convenient bank in
Atlanta.''
   Like Fremont Bank, Bank South builds its offices into the front
of the supermarket. They stay open seven days a week until 8 p.m.,
beginning at 10 a.m. Monday through Saturday and 1 p.m. on Sundays.
   ``The advantage is the relatively low overhead, both in building
the branches and staffing them,'' Spalding said. ``We have two or
three people in a supermarket branch compared to 10 or 12 in a
regular branch.''
   ``The reason that makes sense for us and the customers is that
Sunday is Kroger's second-busiest day of the week, behind
Saturday.''
   Sunday banking ``suits people's lifestyles better,'' he said.
``With two-income families, both people working, they can't meet
the banks' traditional hours.''
   Savings and loans, traditionally more sensitive to retail
customers, have experimented with Sunday hours over the years. They
include Western Savings &amp; Loan Association in Arizona, which has
branches in 24 Smitty's markets in the Phoenix area, which are open
from 8 to 7 on Sundays and 8 to 9 on Saturdays.
   But finding banks willing to stay open on Sunday has been ``very
rare,'' said Virginia Stafford, a spokeswoman for the American
Bankers Association in Washington.
   Still, she suggests that may change _ at least in some places.
   ``Banks are being much more aggressive about drawing customers
these days,'' Ms. Stafford said.
   ``They are making branches more attractive, figuring out ways of
attracting customers rather than just waiting for them to walk in,
selling bank services like you would sell other retail services or
products.''

   Albert Campion often acts like a superficial,
flippant twit, but what can you expect from a detective who says
he's a specialist in fairy tales.
   ``He's fairly hard to fathom,'' said Peter Davison, the English
actor who plays the 1930s sleuth in a new series called ``Campion''
kicking off the fall season for PBS' ``Mystery!'' Davison was
formerly ``Doctor Who'' and appeared in ``All Creatures Great and
Small.''
   ``People think he doesn't take things seriously or doesn't
understand what's going on. It's really a device to keep suspects
off guard. He wears little, round, horn rim glasses. We've decided
those probably aren't real and are just part of the image, too.''
   The series is adapted from the books by British crime writer
Margery Allingham, a peer of Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers.
   The new ``Mystery!'' season opens Thursday with ``Campion'' and
the introduction of Diana Rigg as host in place of departing
Vincent Price.
   Campion is, himself, a bit of a mystery.
   ``He's a slightly enigmatic figure and it's not made clear in
the books what he's really about,'' said Davison. ``He's the
youngest son of a duke who's gone off to seek adventure. In the
1930s it was the practice to send the youngest son off to the
colonies. But he didn't want to do that and set himself up as a
private detective.
   ``His right-hand man is a big, baldheaded ex-convict named
Magersfontein Lugg. He's given up his criminal activities but he's
a source of priceless information for Campion. Albert Campion's not
his real name. Someone calls him Christopher Twelvetrees and
someone else calls him Orlando. He's obviously a gentleman and well
mannered and is equally at home with the aristocracy or criminals
and gypsies.''
   There are four ``Campion'' stories, each told in two weekly
episodes. Brian Glover is Lugg and Andrew Burt is Inspector
Stanislaus Oates of Scotland Yard.
   British critics have said the major strength of the ``Campion''
books were the outrageous plots and their many twists. The opening
story of ``The Case of the Late Pig,'' is about how Campion
investigates the murder of a friend, months after attending the
friend's funeral. The pig's death turns out to be a clue.
   Davison said Allingham wrote some of the books as cerebral
exercises and some as ripping yarns, so there will be a mixture in
the series. She also peopled her books with a lot of Americans, but
some of have been taken out. A main character in the first show was
changed from American to a Scot.
   Most of the stories take place in England, although one is set
on a cruise ship. An opening scene in the French Riviera in one
show was changed to avoid a costly trip to France to film just one
scene.
   Davison grew up in South London and began acting in an
after-school drama club. ``I thought I'd have a go at it,'' he
said. ``I never did well academically. It was always a last-minute
scramble to put things together. So I went to drama school instead
of university. I worked in a dry cleaners and a factory and was a
hospital orderly before starting school.''
   Davison, married about 10 years to American actress Sandra
Dickinson, has an apartment in Los Angeles. They met at the Central
School of Speech and Drama, where both attended.
   ``I don't think we ever said a word to each other in school,''
he said. ``I was aware of her but we were in different years. Then
we did a rock musical version of `A Midsummer Night's Dream' at the
Edinburgh Festival. Sandra has become quite well known in England.''
   Davison said he never trained for a second career in case acting
didn't work out.
   ``A lot of actors are trained in something else,'' he said.
``The temptation is to take another job when things turn bad. When
I had a bad period I had nothing else to turn to. I spent three
years in repertory theater, then I decided I should go into
television. I didn't work for a year.''
   His first major role was in ``Love for Lydia,'' which played
here on Masterpiece Theatre. He was Tristram, one of two brothers,
in the series ``All Creatures Great and Small,'' which was based on
James Herriot's stories about his life as a veterinarian in
Yorkshire.
   He followed Tom Baker as ``Doctor Who,'' a somewhat strange
science fiction fantasy that has a large cult following worldwide.
He was the fifth actor in the role, playing it from 1981-84. Who is
a 750-year-old time traveler from the planet Gallifrey whose
vehicle is a telephone booth.

   In Puerto Rico, which is experiencing one of the
most serious AIDS epidemics in the Western world, a housewife and
her husband have opened a home to care for unwanted children
infected by the virus. It's called Project Love.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marisa Blay was content as a wife,
mother and homemaker until a dream changed her life and led her to
become a guardian of some of the youngest and most-abused victims
of AIDS.
   ``In my dream, I was in heaven and God told me I was going to
hell because he had given me so much and I had never helped anybody
in return,'' she says.
   The result is a non-profit charity called Proyecto Amor, or
Project Love _ Puerto Rico's first home for newborns and toddlers
who are not only infected with the AIDS virus but also have been
battered, neglected or abandoned.
   ``I want the kids nobody wants,'' Mrs. Blay says.
   She and her husband, Jorge, who owns a swimming pool
construction company, used their savings to buy an $85,000 house
and half-acre lot for Proyecto Amor in the San Juan suburb of Rio
Piedras. Local businesses, civic groups and individual donors
provided paint, furniture, clothes and toys.
   After months of untangling red tape with the health authorities,
the home, which Mrs. Blay runs with an assistant, eight nurses and
two cooks, finally opened in July.
   Proyecto Amor is a cheery bungalow surrounded by palms and
broad-leafed tropical plants, with a swing set, a slide and monkey
bars in the back yard. The rooms are airy and freshly painted, the
closets bulge with little dresses and shirts. Bright, new cribs sit
in tidy rows in the three bedrooms.
   ``This is my bed,'' 4-year-old Hilario says proudly, hurrying
over to a crib where he has left his teddy bears from the night
before.
   Hilario, Carmen, 3, and Margarita, 11 months, were the first
children brought to Proyecto Amor. (Their names are changed here at
Mrs. Blay's request.)
   Twelve more children, including a newborn whose drug-addict
mother walked away from her in the hospital, are expected in the
coming months.
   The Project Love home escaped serious damage from Hurricane
Hugo, but the children were temporarily moved out when the
electricity was knocked out.
   Puerto Rico, with a population of 3.3 million is experiencing
one of the most serious AIDS epidemics in the Western world. Since
1982, there have been 2,940 reported cases of AIDS and authorities
estimate 10 times that number may be infected with the virus.
   Mrs. Blay met Carmen on a visit with her church group to a
shelter for battered children. At the age of 4 months, Carmen had
been left alone in an apartment with two toddler brothers for about
five days.
   She was undernourished and had pneumonia and a fungal infection.
Blood tests determined that she was HIV-positive, a carrier of the
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Police picked up Hilario, at the age of 2, wandering the streets
of Old San Juan, the capital's historic district. His mother was a
chronic drug abuser, and he was found to be an AIDS carrier.
   He was brought to the same hospital where Carmen was staying.
They shared a room there for nearly two years, and now they easily
play together around their new home, very much like a brother and
sister.
   ``They've been together so long, they have to be together now,''
Mrs. Blay says. ``It's like they're the only one the other's ever
had.''
   Baby Margarita was born to a drug addict with four other
children, and she nearly died of neglect.
   ``She didn't smile. She didn't cry,'' Mrs. Blay says. ``When
they told us about her, they told us she needs a lot of caring, she
needs to be held a lot. She had never been held.''
   Proyecto Amor is licensed as a shelter for up to 15 children
ranging in age from newborn to 7. The Puerto Rico Department of
Social Services pays $2,000 a month for each child, which covers
food, medicine and a $5,000 monthly staff payroll, Mrs. Blay says.
   The Blays, who have two young children of their own, retain
title to the Proyecto Amor property and pay taxes and utility
charges, even though they do not live there. Mrs. Blay says they
plan to build on more rooms if necessary and did not want to ever
give up ownership for fear it would become too much like an
institution.
   ``I want it to work as a home, full of love for these kids, as
long as they last,'' she says.
   Hilario, Carmen and Margarita all appear healthy now, but
medical statistics are stacked against them. Mrs. Blay says she is
trying to prepare herself emotionally for their deaths.
   ``I know that they have a sickness that will one day bring their
lives to an end,'' she says. ``But I have faith they are going to
last a long time.
   ``The little boy and the little girl have told me they're going
to run this house when they grow up.''

<TEXT>
   Mao Tse-tung, the revolutionary forefather of a
Communist China that now craves stability rather than revolution,
has become a figure of the past.
   Mao's portrait still hangs imposingly from Tiananmen Gate, just
below the rostrum from where he declared the birth of a New China
40 years ago.
   On the opposite side of Tiananmen Square his preserved body has
been viewed by more than 50 million people since the mausoleum
opened 12 years ago. Mao died Sept. 9, 1976.
   A few Mao statues still stand in provincial capitals, although a
four-story landmark at Beijing University was torn down last year.
Weathered photos of the Great Helmsman, as he was called,
occasionally adorn the walls of peasants' homes.
   But for most Chinese, Mao has little relevance in a country that
has undergone vast changes over the past 40 years.
   Under Deng Xiaoping, a prominent victim of Mao's purges, Chinese
historians have judged Mao a revolutionary hero who in his later
years made serious mistakes.
   His Great Leap Forward, the disastrous 1958 plunge into rapid
industrialization, and 1966-76 Cultural Revolution are high on a
list of blunders now attributed to him.
   The Communist Party's History Research Center concluded last
year that Mao's ideological system ``is basically divorced from the
realities in China and is thus incorrect.''
   Mao buttons appeared during democracy demonstrations this past
spring in some cities, and marching workers carried portraits of
Mao. But these gestures appeared to be more a slam at corruption
among today's bureaucrats, unlike the old revolutionaries who took
pride in their honesty and simple lives.
   More in evidence are portraits and references to the late
Premier Chou En-lai, who remains universally beloved among Chinese.
   The conservatives in power since the June crackdown on dissent
have stressed the importance of Mao's thought, as well as the ideas
of Marx and Lenin, but no attempt has been made to reappraise Mao's
role in history.
   A new movie of Mao's revolutionary exploits has come out in time
for the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the Communist
takeover of China, but it is unlikely to inspire many to dig out
their ``Little Red Books'' of Mao quotations, as people did during
the Cultural Revolution.

   If life begins at conception, does
that mean a fetus cannot be jailed, or that someone can add nine
months to his age to avoid being convicted of underage drinking?
   Some Missouri attorneys are asking such questions after the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld key portions of the state's 1986 abortion law.
Legal experts say the lawyers are limited only by their imagination.
   At issue is the law's preamble that says the life of each human
begins at conception. It also says a fetus has the ``rights,
privileges and immunities available to other persons, citizens and
residents of the state.''
   In its July ruling, the Supreme Court did not strike down the
preamble, saying it was not unconstitutional because it has no
enforceable restrictions on abortions. It also said state courts
must decide how it applies to other Missouri laws.
   Since the Supreme Court ruling, some lawyers have started using
the life-begins-at-conception argument for other issues.
   For instance:
   _A U.S. District Court lawsuit contends a fetus is illegally
imprisoned because the mother is an inmate at a state prison. It
argues the fetus is not charged with a crime, convicted or
sentenced. Attorney Michael Box, who filed the suit, said, ``If
life begins at conception, then fetuses are supposed to be like
anyone else _ they're a person and they have constitutional
rights.''
   _A 20-year-old Columbia man, charged with driving while
intoxicated and possession of alcohol by a minor, claimed the
state's law against underage drinking does not apply to him. He
said the life-begins-at-conception doctrine adds nine months to his
life, making him 21 _ Missouri's legal drinking age. A trial judge
disagreed, but the man's attorney, Daniel Dodson, plans to appeal.
   _Anti-abortion protesters in St. Louis were acquitted of
trespassing charges from sit-in demonstrations at an abortion
clinic. They argued they were trying to save lives by preventing
abortions. The judge agreed, citing the preamble. Previously,
another St. Louis judge used the same legal logic to find other
protesters innocent of trespassing in a similar case.
   While such arguments are inventive, legal authorities say, they
still must show legal merit to prevail.
   ``I think you are going to have to make a close relationship
between the abortion statute and whatever other statute the court
or the attorneys are trying to apply,'' said Timothy Heinsz, dean
of the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Law. ``The
argument is limited only by the creative mind of the attorney.''
   Michael Boicourt, the assistant attorney general who helped
defend the abortion law, said the preamble doesn't create any
rights or privileges for fetuses and merely states legislative
policy. He said its main effect will be in property rights,
personal injury and criminal law cases.
   ``I don't think the preamble will ever be interpreted by the
courts to create a ridiculous result,'' Boicourt said.
   Referring to attempts to apply the preamble language to the
underage driving and similar cases, he added: ``These cases aren't
serious. They are interesting to the public, but they aren't
legally serious.''
   State Rep. Sue Shear has asked Attorney General William Webster
for an opinion on whether the preamble affects various state laws
involving age requirements. Webster argued the case before the
Supreme Court.
   Ms. Shear said she sought the non-binding opinion because she
thought lawyers would have a ``heyday'' with the preamble and it
needed to be resolved. Webster's office says it is researching the
issue.
   Louis DeFeo, executive director of the Missouri Catholic
Conference, said many of the issues could be raised under other
state laws and court decisions.
   ``The rights of unborn children didn't originate with this,''
said DeFeo, a lawyer and one of the law's authors. ``Lawsuits can
be filed and claims recovered. Trusts and property can go to unborn
children. There is nothing new with the law recognizing the rights
of the unborn.''
   In an unrelated Tennessee case, a judge ruled recently that
``life begins at conception'' and awarded temporary custody of
seven frozen embryos to a woman who is divorcing her husband. The
husband plans to appeal, but legal authorities have said the
decision _ that embryos are persons _ might lead to inheritance
disputes or prompt in-vitro fertilization doctors to fear murder
charges if implanted embryos fail to come to term.
   St. Louis attorney Frank Susman, who argued against the Missouri
law before the Supreme Court, said he warned that the ramifications
would be unknown and numerous.
   The law, he said, ``demonstrates the total absurdity of what the
Legislature did and of not having thought things through on a piece
of legislation.''
   As to whether attorneys have any legal basis in some of the
cases, Susman said it seems they do. ``The language suggests that
you are a person from the moment of conception.''
   Others say the publicity from the case has drawn lawyers'
attention to the life-begin-at-conception argument.
   ``It's almost like the Supreme Court put its stamp of appoval on
it by not striking it down, and that makes it easier to utilize,''
said St. Louis attorney Andrew Puzder, who came up with the idea of
the preamble.
   Even so, Puzder questioned some of the arguments, including the
imprisoned fetus lawsuit.
   ``It's a silly issue, whether an unborn child has a right to be
where the mother isn't. That can never be. The legitimate issue is
the quality of pre-natal care and that is a legitimate issue with
or without this statute,'' he said.
   Puzder said the underage drinking case lacks merit because state
law says a person's age is calculated from the time they are born.
   ``This law was never intended to change the time by which you
compute a person's age by their date of birth,'' he said. ``Nobody
has the right to have that date moved up or back. Nothing that says
life begins at conception changes how the state computes age.''
   The question of when life begins already has been addessed for
tax purposes by state Revenue Director Duane Benton. After the
court's ruling, some questioned whether a fetus could be claimed as
a state tax deduction.
   But Benton, a tax lawyer, decided the answer was no. He said
Missouri's tax law adopts provisions of the federal tax code, which
say an unborn child is not a person for the purpose of a personal
exemption.

   The head of the World Bank, responding to
longstanding criticism, pledged Tuesday that his agency would make
protection of the earth's resources a top priority in the 1990s.
   ``In the coming decade, it will be impossible to improve the
quality of life in developing and industrial countries alike unless
we do much more to conserve our global environment,'' World Bank
President Barber Conable said in his opening address to the annual
meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
   Over the years, environmental groups have attacked both
international lending organizations for ignoring the environmental
threats posed by the loans they made to the Third World for such
projects as hydroelectric dams, roads and other development
projects.
   Last year's annual meeting in West Berlin was disrupted on the
opening day by thousands of environmental protestors.
   Conable told the delegates from 152 nations that his agency is
striving to improve in this area by building environmental impact
assessments into its loan review process and by boosting its
monetary support to address such key environmental threats as
depletion of tropical rain forests, ocean pollution and global
warming from the excessive use of fossil fuels.
   In addition to global pollution, the finance officials were
reviewing such issues as the Third World debt crisis, the political
upheaval in Eastern Europe and the efforts needed to keep huge
trade imbalances from derailing the global economic expansion.
   The U.S. delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
continued to push forward with its debt-reductioninitiative, which
seeks to trim poor countries' debt burden by using IMF and World
Bank resources to spur debt forgiveness on the part of commercial
banks.
   President Bush met with 65 leading bankers and other
international leaders at the White House to solicit support for the
Brady plan.
   The administration got good news Tuesday, when Venezuelan
planning minister Miguel Rodriguez Fandeo indicated that his
country was backing away from its demand that commercial banks
provide the nation with a 50 percent debt reduction, a demand the
banks had dismissed as completely unreasonable.
   While the negotiations are continuing, Rodriguez said a group of
15 banks has indicated it would provide Venezuela with a short-term
loan of $600 million to allow the country to catch up on late
interest payments.
   The remarkable political changes under way in Eastern Europe
were also under review at the annual meetings. Polish Finance
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz held discussions this week with Brady
to outline the proposals his new government, the first in Eastern
Europe to be led by non-Communists, was considering adopting to
restructure the country's crippled economy.
   President Bush's speech to the finance ministers Wednesday will
touch on the need for the West to provide financial support for the
historic reforms underway in the Communist bloc, according to
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Other countries have also made international aid to Poland and
Hungary top priorities with many officials saying the IMF and the
World Bank need to focus expanded resources during the next decade
toward the goal of integrating the Communist world into the global
economy.
   In his opening speech, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus
called this development ``complex and historically unprecedented''
and said many of the Communist nations needed to better address the
high rates of inflation plaguing their nations.
   Fitzwater said that the administration was ``sympathetic to the
need for more funds'' being sought by the World Bank and the IMF to
meet its growing responsibilities but that ``we haven't made
judgments yet about the amounts of aid.''
   Finance officials from the world's seven richest countries
continued their efforts Tuesday to push the dollar lower on foreign
currency markets as a way of addressing America's huge trade
deficit.
   Currency traders reported that major central banks intervened
numerous times during the day to sell dollars as the banks
continued to back up a joint statement by the Group of Seven
nations on Saturday that a further rise in the dollar's value
represented a threat to the world economy.
   The efforts managed to drive the dollar lower in trading in
Tokyo and London but the dollar rose slightly against the yen in
New York, to 142.35, still down significantly from the 146-yen
level of just last Friday.
   Referring to the environment, French Finance Minister Pierre
Beregovoy said he believed the rich nations should voluntarily
provide more money to the World Bank for environmental problems. He
said France was prepared to contribute $140 million toward a goal
of creating an environmental fund of $1.25 billion.
   Brady, in his speech at the opening session, called it essential
for the World Bank to be guided by the principle that ``development
and environmental protection must go hand in hand.'' But Brady
offered no proposal to boost World Bank resources for this purpose.
   The world's richest countries also addressed environmental
problems at this year's economic summit in Paris. In his remarks,
Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said his country was
moving forward with commitments made in Paris to provide $2.1
billion over three years to support conservation efforts in the
Third World.
   In addition to the environment, Conable said the Third World
must trim the $200 billion it spends annually on defense if it
expects to end its prolonged debt problems.
   Conable said developing countries are devoting 20 percent of
their government spending to defense and in the mid-1980s military
costs exceeded the amounts Third World nations were devoting to
health and education combined.
   ``Let us hope that, in the changing political climate of the
1990s, resources are increasingly allocated to more productive
purposes, in industrial countries as well as developing
countries,'' Conable said.

<TEXT>
   Former Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian was
denied a new trial one day before he was to be sentenced for nine
security-related felonies.
   Bilzerian, a 39-year-old corporate takeover strategist from
Tampa, Fla., was convicted in June in the first jury verdict in the
government's three-year crackdown on Wall Street securities crime.
   The case also was the first prosecution of a takeover speculator
using information derived from the Ivan Boesky insider trading
scandal that broke in 1986.
   Bilzerian, through his attorney Arthur Mathews, had asked to be
retried because of rulings by the judge that they alleged were
wrong or improper.
   The motion had charged that U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward's
rulings on attorney-client privilege were erroneous; that Ward
improperly admitted evidence of Bilzerian's inaccurate 1986
personal tax return; and that the judge improperly admitted certain
testimony from a government expert.
   On Tueday, Ward denied the motion on all three arguments.
   Bilzerian faces a maximum penalty of 45 years in prison and
$2.25 million in fines at his scheduled sentencing today before
Ward.
   He was convicted of breaking securities and tax laws and making
false statements in connection with three failed takeover attempts,
involving apparel maker Cluett, Peabody & Co.; building supplies
maker H.H. Robertson & Co.; and Hammermill Paper Co.; and another
transaction of Armco Inc. stock in 1985 and 1986.
   Bilzerian resigned as chairman of Singer on June 29, the day the
Securities and Exchange Commission filed a suit seeking to recover
more than $31 million in illegal profits from Bilzerian for
``numerous and serious'' securities violations.

<HEAD>BAT Restructuring Won't Deter Bid, Goldsmith Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith says
the defensive restructuring proposed by BAT Industries PLC is
welcome but won't deter his hostile $22 billion bid for the British
conglomerate.
   BAT on Tuesday announced plans to sell its U.S. retailing
businesses, spin off other operations and buy back 10 percent of
its stock to enhance the value of its shares.
   Later in the day, Goldsmith characterized BAT's plan a ``first
step'' to the ``unbundling'' plan he has proposed through his
Hoylake Investments Ltd. takeover bid. He said Hoylake would vote
its shares in favor of it.
   The restructuring wouldn't mean he would be willing to give up
the takeover bid, which has been suspended while it overcomes U.S.
regulatory hurdles, he said.
   Analysts said BAT's proposal would enhance the British
conglomerate's stock price and was likely to be approved by
shareholders. But they said Hoylake could come back later and bid
for what is left of BAT.
   BAT said it would reshape itself to concentrate on its tobacco
business, which is a steady cash generator, and its fast-growing
financial services operations. This would be a significant
departure from its previous strategy of gradually diversifying away
from tobacco.
   Hoylake, consisting of Goldsmith, British merchant banker Jacob
Rothschild, Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer and other
investors, has proposed restructuring BAT by selling off all its
non-tobacco interests.
   BAT said the businesses it would retain were expected to account
for 80 percent of its forecast 1989 pre-tax profit of $3.2 billion.
   The U.S. retailing operations that would be sold include 46 Saks
Fifth Avenue stores and 24 Marshall Field's stores. The two chains
have combined annual sales of $2 billion.
   These and other planned, smaller disposals could fetch $2.4
billion, analysts said.
   BAT said it would create two new publicly held companies by
giving its existing stockholders shares in its British retailing
company Argos, as well as shares in a combination of its paper
companies Wiggins Teape and Appleton.
   BAT said it would buy back 10 percent of its shares, which would
cost the equivalent of $2 billion at Tuesday's closing price.
   It also pledged to ``significantly increase'' its dividends. The
total dividend for 1989 could go as high as the equivalent of 48
cents, a 49 percent increase over the previous year, BAT said.
   ``It's a useful start,'' Nigel Utley, an analyst with Laing and
Cruickshank, said of BAT's plan. ``It will enhance shareholder
value, but not necessarily enough to defeat a serious bid.''
   Andrew Mitchell, an analyst with the London investment firm
Smith New Court PLC, said, ``It does seem likely that they
(shareholders) would approve these proposals because it gives them
a bird in the hand.''
   BAT called a special Oct. 19 shareholders meeting to vote on the
measures.
   BAT shares rose the equivalent of 3 cents to close Tueday at
$13.17 on London's Stock Exchange. They were up more than 81 cents
earlier in the day.
   Hoylake has suspended its offer of $14.14 in debt securities for
each BAT share while U.S. state insurance commissioners review its
proposed change of ownership of BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc.
of Los Angeles.
   In a telephone interview with AP-Dow Jones News Service,
Goldsmith said, ``The point is that they've (BAT) made a first
step'' in the direction of realizing a higher share value, which is
the basis of the Hoylake argument.

<HEAD>Church's-Popeyes Merger Steps Up Heat in War With The Colonel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLEY SHANNON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the colonel's troops are leading
in the fried chicken war, newly merged Church's and Popeyes are
banking on marketing and franchising tactics to gain ground in the
$9 billion industry.
   Church's Fried Chicken Inc. and Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and
Biscuits _ second and third before the merger among chicken chains
behind Kentucky Fried Chicken _ will keep their names.
   But Church's old business plan _ small restaurants catering to
inner city clientele _ is undergoing a change as flashier decor,
new menu items and some price increases are in store for customers
accustomed to small orange and green buildings offering basic,
inexpensive chicken.
   The merger was completed Wednesday with a shareholders meeting
in Metarie, La., ending a process begun last year when Al Copeland,
owner of New Orleans-based Popeyes, launched an unsolicited tender
offer for San Antonio-based Church's.
   Under a February agreement, Copeland bought 86 percent of
Church's stock for $331 million, with fees and other expenses
estimated at $150 million. Church's and Popeyes will operate under
Al Copeland Enterprises with offices in New Orleans and San Antonio.
   Paul Hargett, senior vice president of finance for the merged
companies, said chicken lovers will continue to have a choice
between Church's and Popeyes, although ``there will be areas of the
country where we will have conversions'' from one chain to the
other.
   A total of 150 Church's stores were closed and are being sold
for real estate value, Hargett said.
   In an attempt to wipe away some of Church's red ink, the company
plans to emphasize franchised stores rather than company-owned
stores within the Church's division.
   ``The real crux of the matter is we have half a billion dollars
worth of debt,'' said Hargett, who was with Church's and is staying
on after the merger.
   Church's had 1,107 company stores and 361 franchises, compared
with 101 Popeyes company stores and 618 Popeyes franchises.
   By year's end, the company aims to operate 801 Church's company
stores and have 371 franchises, while running 150 Popeyes company
stores and 643 franchises.
   Church's stores averaged an annual sales volume of $420,000
each, far short of the $750,000 annual sales volume averaged by
Popeyes stores.
   ``So we are concentrating a lot on these stores that fit the
demographics of the Popeyes profile,'' Hargett said.
   What is that profile?
   A proxy statement to shareholders says, ``Popeyes restaurants
have experienced significantly higher per unit sales in suburban
and middle-income urban locations than have Church's restaurants.''
   Meanwhile, Church's has targeted ``primarily urban blue collar
customers, including those in the ethnic and minority segments of
the population,'' the proxy states.
   The company is experimenting with a new Church's look that
includes more space and brighter colors. Menu changes also are in
order. Church's already has introduced a new type of biscuit and
will be selling a ``new Southern-style fried chicken.''
   Also, according to the proxy statement, the past Church's policy
of ``big pieces, little prices'' was ineffective, contributing to a
decline in revenue. Consumers can expect a backing away from that
strategy as Church's stops buying larger chickens and tries to
reduce its per-piece cost. It also plans to raise some prices.
   Not everyone is predicting a smooth ride for Church's and
Popeyes.
   Ernie Renaud, former president and chief executive officer of
Church's, said placating Popeyes franchisees will be the biggest
obstacle.
   ``You expect to be given 110 percent by the franchiser to help
make sure you succeed,'' Renaud said. ``It's like going to a doctor
and finding out he's got too many patients and can't do right by
you ... How he (Copeland) handles his franchisees is going to be
the key to his success.''
   Howard Hansen, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. who follows
the fast-food industry, said that while Church's and Popeyes are
settling in to their new relationship, arch-rival Kentucky Fried
Chicken will continue opening stores.
   Catching Kentucky Fried Chicken, a unit of Pepsico Inc., will be
a long race for Copeland Enterprises, Hansen said. ``It's like
Burger King trying to catch up with McDonald's.''
   Greg Reynolds, KFC's vice president for public affairs, said he
is hesitant to criticize competitors but proclaims that his company
plans to stay on top.
   Kentucky Fried Chicken feels a bigger threat from more
mainstream fast-food companies, such as McDonald's, which are
introducing new chicken dishes, he said.
   ``Clearly the market for chicken is out there.''

<TEXT>
   The management of Marshall Field and Co. will bid
to buy the department store chain, which would be sold under a
major restructuring proposed by its British parent, the chain's
chairman said.
   Philip B. Miller said Tuesday that management intends to make
``an aggressive buyout offer'' in response to the announcement by
London-based BAT Industries PLC that it will sell its U.S.
retailing operations in an effort to fight a hostile takeover by
financier Sir James Goldsmith.
   Field's chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement
that management will make a ``competitive offer which will meet the
fiduciary requirements of BAT's board, ensuring fair value to BAT
shareholders.'' He did not place a dollar value on it.
   Marshall Field has 24 stores in Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin and
Texas that employ 13,000 people. The chain opened its flagship
store in Chicago in 1856 as one of the nation's first and most
successful department stores.
   The company is projecting record sales and earnings for 1989,
Miller said in a statement.
   He said the chain posted its first $1 billion sales year in in
1988 with a profit of $83 million.
   Under a management buyout, Miller said the company ``would
continue to be operated at the highly productive level that has
contributed to the success of the management team in the last five
years.''
   BAT announced earlier Tuesday that it planned to sell its U.S.
retailing operations _ including Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall
Field's and two regional retailers _ and concentrate on its tobacco
and financial services businesses.

<HEAD>Government Plans Fines Against Chevron For Refinery Safety Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Department announced plans to fine
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. $877,000 for 114 safety violations in
connection with a Richmond, Calif., refinery fire last spring in
which three workers were severely burned.
   ``The great tragedy of these injuries is that they were
avoidable,'' Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said Tuesday in
announcing the findings of the department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, which inspected the refinery after the
accident.
   The safety agency concluded that Chevron was aware that workers
responsible for assisting firefighters should have had protective
equipment and clothing. It said individual refinery workers and
union officials have been requesting protective equipment for
several years but the company saw no need for it.
   ``The company failed to provide even this most fundamental basic
equipment,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   Jeff Krag, a Chevron spokesman at the refinery, said the company
had not finished reviewing the proposed Labor Department fines but
``on initial glance'' saw flaws in OSHA's analysis of the accident.
He said the company would appeal the penalties.
   The company has 15 days to contest the fines in administrative
proceedings before the department makes them final.
   The safety agency determined that the April 10 fire began when a
pipe carrying highly pressurized hydrogen gas separated at a weld.
The resulting fire and explosion weakened an adjacent reactor,
which fell and engulfed four workers in flames.
   Three who were wearing no fire-resistant clothing received
second- and third-degree burns over as much as 70 percent of their
bodies from hot oil.
   The fourth worker, a firefighter, escaped with minor first- and
second-degree burns on his face because he wore fire-resistant
clothing that covered the rest of his body, the dpartment said.
   Five other workers suffered less serious injuries.

<HEAD>House Committee Votes To Strip Treasury of Loan Authority</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee has voted to strip
the Treasury Department's authority over low-interest loans and
loan guarantees to Third World countries for buying high-tech goods
or construction services from U.S. companies.
   On a 28-22 vote Tuesday, the committee effectively turned that
authority over to the Export-Import Bank as part of a bill raising
its ``tied-aid'' war chest by $200 million and imposing new
environmental conditions on U.S. approval of World Bank and
International Monetary Fund aid to underdeveloped countries.
   U.S. manufacturers have complained that the Treasury _ in its
effort to deter the use of such tied-aid packages by other other
countries, chiefly Japan and France _ has been too tight-fisted in
approving loans and loan guarantees to finance their exports.
   As a result, the American companies claim they are losing out on
$2 billion to $4 billion a year in foreign contracts.
   The bill also authorizes $400 million over the next five years
for the multinational Inter-American Development Bank to support
loans in Latin America and $150 million for a special IMF account
that subsidizes interest payments on loans owed by very poor
countries, especially in Africa.
   Under the legislation, which was approved by the committee on a
voice vote, the U.S. representatives to the World Bank and IMF
would be prohibited from approving loans for Third World projects
without an environmental assessment first.
   The environmental measure was modified Tuesday to allow for some
exceptions after the Treasury Department threatened to recommend a
veto of the bill unless it was given some discretion.

<HEAD>EEC Official: U.S. Need Not Fear `Fortress Europe' Trading Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should not fear a ``Fortress
Europe'' when the 12-nation European Economic Community forms a
single trading market in 1993, a European Community official said.
   The United States and other European Community trade partners
will benefit considerably when the Western European nations unify
into one, $4 trillion market with 320 million consumers, said Willy
de Clercq, a member of the European Parliament and chairman of its
committee for external relations.
   U.S. business interests fear that ``local content'' regulations
requiring many goods to be produced in European Community nations
and proposed technical standards for imports could result in
barriers against U.S. products and turn Europe into a trading
fortress.
   ``These fears are unjustified,'' de Clercq said Tuesday at a
Washington-Brussels trade forum. ``Far from creating a Fortress
Europe, the creation of an internal market will create significant
benefits for our trading partners.''
   He said the European Community 1992 internal markets scheme,
which goes into effect Jan. 1, 1993, ``will offer considerable
opportunities to non-community interests'' selling to the European
Community.
   Those would include, he said, uniform standards and procedures;
increased investment opportunities; and non-discrimination against
foreign companies with European Community ties.
   As for concerns that a self-absorbed European Community will
become more protectionist, de Clercq said ``It would not be in our
own interests to go down this road.''
   He noted that the European Community relies much more on trade
than the United States or Japan. The European Community derives 13
percent of its industrial and commercial goods from imports, while
it has captured 24 percent of the world's export trade.
   By comparison, the United States has 8 percent of the world
export market; the Japanese 16 percent, he said.
   Tom Duesterberg, the assistant commerce secretary for
international economic policy, said the United States welcomed the
European calls but still had major concerns over some provisions of
European Community 1992.
   The United States still is worried about standards, testing and
certification procedures for U.S. goods and by local content
provisions on the auto and broadcasting industries, Duesterberg
said.
   France is lobbying for tough mandatory quotas on
foreign-produced TV programs and the U.S. entertainment industry
fears it could suffer a drastic cutback in its multibillion-dollar
export business to Europe.
   The European Community will adopt a final guidelines on TV
program content next month, and if France prevails ``That would be
a very serious problem,'' Duesterberg said.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills earlier this year said a
tough European Community quota system on television would give the
Bush administration no choice but to consider sanctions under U.S.
trade laws.

<HEAD>BAT Industries Should Have Plenty of Potential Buyers</HEAD>

   BAT Industries PLC likely will lure
plenty of potential buyers for Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field's
and its other retailers, to be sold in a major restructuring aimed
at thwarting an unwanted takeover attempt.
   The British conglomerate has pumped money into its retailing
businesses for renovation and expansion, said Eugene Russell, a
spokesman for Louisville-based BATUS Inc., BAT's U.S. holding
company.
   ``Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's are premier retailers
and Ivey's and Breuners are strong regional companies with great
potential,'' he said. ``And during the course of this recent
period, there has been unusually strong interest in these
properties.''
   BAT, trying to fight off a $22 billion bid from a group led by
financier Sir James Goldsmith, said Tuesday it planned to sell its
U.S. retailing operations and concentrate on its tobacco and
financial services businesses.
   Shareholders will vote on the proposed restructuring at an Oct.
19 meeting.
   Saks, which has 46 stores in 18 states, had sales of $1.2
billion in 1988. The chain, which has about 10,000 employees, is
undergoing a $360 million renovation and expansion program.
   Marshall Field's, with 24 stores in Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin
and Texas, had sales of $1 billion in 1988, Russell said. The chain
employs 13,000 people, and its flagship store in Chicago is in the
midst of a $105 million restoration.
   After BAT revealed its intentions, the management of Marshall
Field &amp; Co. said they intend to try to buy the department store
chain. Philip B. Miller, chairman and chief executive officer of
the chain, said Tuesday that management intends to make ``an
aggressive buyout offer.''
   Ivey's, headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., has 24 stores in North
Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. The chain employs 5,000
people, said Russell, who did not provide sales figures.
   Breuners has more than 50 furniture stores and rental outlets in
California, Arizona and Nevada and employs about 1,200 people,
Russell said. He did not have sales figures for Breuners, either.
   BAT's plan would create two new publicly held companies by
giving its existing shareholders shares in its British retailing
company Argos, as well as shares in a combination of its paper
companies, London-based Wiggins Teape and Appleton.
   Appleton, headquartered in Appleton, Wis., is the world's
largest producer of carbonless paper and the nation's top producer
of thermal paper for facsimile machines, Russell said. The company,
with 3,600 employees, has eight plants in four states _ Wisconsin,
Ohio, Pennsyvlania and Michigan. It had sales of $844 million in
1988.
   BAT, originally called British-American Tobacco, is the world's
biggest tobacco company. It will retain Louisville-based Brown &amp;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., the nation's third-largest tobacco
concern.
   ``The company remains deeply committed to its Kentucky roots,
and the reshaped BAT Industries will allow B&amp;W to continue to grow
and flourish,'' Russell said.
   Brown &amp; Williamson, which employs about 5,000 people, had total
sales of nearly $2.8 million in 1988, Russell said. The company has
production facilities in Macon, Ga., and leaf processing facilities
in Wilson, N.C. Its cigarette brands include Kool, Viceroy and
Barclay.
   The cigarette company, which claims about 11 percent of the U.S.
market, holds 25 percent of the Japanese import market and 36
percent of the newly opened South Korean import market, Russell
said.
   BAT anticipates more rapid growth from its financial services
division.
   BAT's Farmers Insurance Group Inc., headquartered in Los
Angeles, is the nation's third largest personal lines insurer,
operating in 27 states in the western half of the United States.
   Russell said tobacco and financial services are ``generators of
cash and have robust qualities.''
   He said it was ``premature'' to comment on how BAT's
restructuring will affect BATUS, which has about 100 employees in
Louisville.

<HEAD>Parent Company for Pabst to Challenge Proposed Coors-Stroh Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent company of Milwaukee-based Pabst
Brewing Co. says it plans to challenge Adolph Coors Co.'s proposed
purchase of the Stroh Brewery Co.
   S&amp;P Companies, based in Mill Valley, Calif., said Tuesday it
would file a lawsuit later this week or early next week alleging
the Coors' plan would violate federal antitrust laws, said William
M. Bitting, S&amp;Ps legal counsel.
   ``This combination is going to create another oligopoly that's
very tough on the rest of us,'' Bitting said. ``It's
anti-competitive.''
   S&amp;P, which was among bidders for Stroh, also will participate in
a formal hearing before the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice
Department the week of Oct. 9, Bitting said.
   Coors, based in Golden, Colo., announced Monday it planned to
purchase the majority of Stroh's assets for $425 million in a deal
that analysts said could create a ``Big Three'' of brewing.
   The top two brewing companies _ Anheuser-Busch Inc., St. Louis,
and the Miller Brewing Co., Milwaukee _ control 65 percent of the
domestic beer market.
   Analysts estimated that a Coors-Stroh combination could grab
about 19 percent of the market, based on current shares. Pabst is
the nation's sixth largest brewer.
   The deal, which Coors does not expect to complete until at least
early 1990, requires U.S. Justice Department approval.

<HEAD>Checchi Agrees to Cut KLM Interest in Northwest Buyout, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi has
agreed to cut KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' stake in the Northwest
Airlines buyout to ease government concerns about foreign airline
influence over Northwest, according to a published report today.
   The Minneapolis-based Northwest has agreed to a Transportation
Department demand to reduce a $400 million investment by KLM and to
remove KLM from the board of NWA Inc., the airline's parent
company, The Wall Street Journal reported, quoting an unidentified
source.
   The Star Tribune, quoting unidentified government sources,
reported Wednesday that Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner has
determined that KLM's existing $400 million equity stake exceeds
federal regulations, which restrict foreign ownership to 25 percent
of a U.S. carrier.
   According to The Wall Street Journal, Checchi has agreed to cut
the KLM stake by $225 million, to $175 million.
   The cutback in the KLM investment would reduce the Dutch
airline's percentage of the $700 million in cash equity raised for
the buyout from 57 percent to 25 percent, the Journal said. KLM has
only a 5 percent voting stake in Northwest because its stake is
mostly in non-voting preferred stock.
   Skinner and Checchi met Friday to discuss Skinner's review of
Checchi's $3.65 billion takeover of NWA Inc. Neither Skinner nor
Checchi has commented publicly on the talks.
   Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen said Wednesday the airline
would have no comment on the published reports until the
Transportation Department releases its findings.
   In his first public appearance since acquiring Northwest this
summer, Checchi Tuesday night made no reference to the
Transportation Department review other than to say, ``Sam Skinner
and I are becoming great friends.''
   In a speech to Minnesota businesspeople, Checchi predicted
dramatic growth for the airline and outlined his philosophy.
   ``All the assets are in place here for success,'' Checchi told
900 members of the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce at the group's
annual meeting. ``I look at Northwest as absolutely the culminating
challenge of my career.''
   Checchi, who has maintained a low profile since the acquisition,
has spent the past several months meeting Northwest employees at
the company headquarters in Eagan, a Minneapolis suburb. He said he
soon would ``embark on a worldwide tour of Northwest employees'' in
an effort to foster employee-management relations.
   ``I really do believe that people are our most important
assets,'' he said. ``I want our employees to have the same sense of
satisfaction from their work that I've had from mine in the last 15
years.''
   Checchi's group, Wings Holdings Ltd., bought NWA for $3.65
billion or $121 a share. He predicted that bank debt for the
acquisition would be paid off in ``between five and six years.''
   ``Northwest is going to grow dramatically in the Pacific ... and
domestically,'' Checchi predicted, noting that among the company's
``hidden assets'' is a $1.5 billion equity value in its aircraft.
   American airline companies, Checchi said, are basically the
same. He said NWA under his reign will surpass the others because
of its commitment to customer satisfaction.
   ``The airline industry is the industry in which the American
people have the least confidence of any industry in the U.S. ...
Providing superior service is the only way to differentiate
yourself,'' he said.
   Checchi, who holds an MBA from Harvard Business School, was
formerly associated with the Marriott Hotels and Walt Disney Co.

   RJR Nabisco Inc. announced today it is setting up
headquarters on the Avenue of the Americas in New York, making the
company's move out of Atlanta official.
   RJR Nabisco said in April it was planning to move from its
suburban Atlanta headquarters to New York, and the company's top
executives have been operating out of temporary offices in New York
for several months while maintaining an office here.
   The tobacco and food giant moved to Atlanta from its longtime
home in Winston-Salem, N.C., in 1987. The company was acquired by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in a record-setting $24.5 billion
debt-financed buyout that was finalized earlier this year.
   ``For the job we have ahead of us, New York is the place to
be,'' said RJR Nabisco Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. ``We plan to
sink roots here (in New York).''
   The company said it had signed a 10-year lease for 86,400 square
feet of office space. The space is being renovated for occupancy
next June.

<HEAD>Newspaper: GM Was on Verge of Jaguar Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. short-circuited a plan earlier
this month for General Motors Corp. to acquire 30 percent of Jaguar
plc by moving to buy some of the British luxury carmaker's stock,
the Wall Street Journal reported today.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources at Ford and GM, said
Ford announced it was seeking to buy 15 percent of Jaguar's stock
shortly after it got wind of the deal top GM executives were
discussing with Jaguar.
   Executives at GM and the financially troubled Jaguar are
reassessing their positions in light of the Ford move, the Journal
said.
   GM spokesman Jack Harned said the company had no comment on the
Journal report.
   Ford's announcement on Sept. 19 that it was buying the Jaguar
stock came in reaction to an anticipated bid by GM for all or part
of Jaguar, but Ford officials didn't know that the two companies
were on the verge of announcing the deal in which GM would own 30
percent of Jaguar, according to the newspaper.
   Ford spokesman Rex Greenslade said the company had heard rumors
for months that a variety of companies, including GM, were
interested in a stake in Jaguar. But Ford did not react solely to a
GM bid for part of Jaguar.
   ``We felt that we wanted to do this to show that we felt this
was a very good fit between the companies,'' Greenslade said. Talks
between Ford and Jaguar had gone on before Ford's announcement, he
added, and none have been scheduled since.
   Jaguar officials called Ford's announcement unwelcome.
   ``It's obvious that companies the size of Jaguar cannot and will
not survive in the long term,'' Greenslade said. ``They're going to
have to have strategic associations.''
   Ford has no luxury performance car in its lineup that would
compete with Jaguar. GM markets the Cadillac Allante in the market
segment. Ford has confirmed that it is talking with the Swedish
carmaker and truckmaker Saab-Scania AB.

   Former Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian was
sentenced today to four years in prison and fined $1.5 million for
federal securities and tax law violations related to three takeover
attempts and a stock deal.
   The sentence for Bilzerian, 39, a one-time corporate raider who
made a stunning raid on Singer, was the largest handed down in the
government's three-year crackdown on Wall Street crime.
   U.S. District Judge Robert L. Ward also sentenced Bilzerian to
two years probation and 250 hours of community service for his
conviction on nine felony counts involving deals in 1985 and 1986.
   ``The lure of money has caused him _ an intelligent young man _
to lose what I perceive to be proper perspective,'' Ward said. ``In
short, he lies.''
   Bilzerian was convicted by a federal jury June 9 of securities
fraud, conspiracy to commit tax fraud and filing false disclosure
statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The charges involved three failed takeover attempts, involving
apparel maker Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., building supplies maker H.H.
Robertson &amp; Co. and Hammermill Paper Co., and another transaction
of Armco Inc. stock.
   Bilzerian, of Tampa, Fla., bowed his head and closed his eyes as
Ward read the count-by-count verdict. His wife, Terri, and other
family members sat in the front row of the courtroom at U.S.
District Court in Manhattan.
   Ward sentenced Bilzerian to four years and fined him $250,000 on
each of six of the counts but ordered the prison terms to run
concurrently.
   Bilzerian's attorney, Arthur Mathews, said he planned to appeal.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Brodsky cited Bilzerian's alleged
``arrogance and utter disregard for the law'' during the court
proceedings, and said a lengthy prison term would serve as a
deterrent to similar crimes.
   ``He has been convicted of a pattern of fraudulent securities
transactions,'' Brodsky told the judge. ``Over an 18-month period
Bilzerian committed serious securities crimes over and over again.''
   Mathews sought a suspended sentence on the grounds that the
conviction was Bilzerian's first, that the violations for which he
was prosecuted had never before been tried criminally and that
deterrence had been achieved in the case.
   The Bilzerian conviction was the first jury verdict in the
government's white-collar investigations. To date, the longest
sentence was given to admitted felon Ivan Boesky, who is serving a
three-year prison term.
   The charges were derived from information supplied by Boesky.
None of the charges involved Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeover of
Singer in 1988. The case was the first to prosecute illegal stock
``parking,'' in which securities ownership is disguised to dodge
federal disclosure laws.
   Bilzerian faced a maximum 45 years in prison and fines of $2.25
million.
   He resigned as chairman of Singer on June 29, when the SEC filed
a suit seeking to recover more than $31 million in illegal profits
from Bilzerian for ``numerous and serious'' securities violations.

   Futures prices for grains and soybeans were
mostly lower early in the session today at the Chicago Board of

   Depressing prices, analysts said, was the forecast of good

that the Agriculture Department has targeted the African country
for 1 million metric tons of export bonus wheat, analysts said.
   But wheat prices turned lower due to a noticeable lack of
commercial buying, they said.
   In early trading, wheat was 2\ cents lower to { cent higher,
with December at $3.94} a bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 1{ cents
lower, with December at $2.28\ a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to
\ cent higher, with December at $1.43\ a bushel; and soybeans were
2 cents lower to 3 cents higher, with November at $5.64\.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, futures prices for cattle
were mainly higher, while pork complex futures were mostly lower.
   In early trading, live cattle were .10 cent to .38 cent higher,
with the contract for October at 72.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .15 cent lower to .23 cent higher, with September at 83.10
cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .40 cent lower, with
October at 43.15 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .10
cent higher to .42 cent lower, with February at 48.15 cents a pound.
   On Tuesday, futures prices for cattle rose, but prices fell in
the pork complex.

<HEAD>A Majority of House Members Lean Toward Cutting Capital Gains Tax</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Top 6 grafs new with caucuses; picks up pvs graf 2: The 2,000-page.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A majority of House members lean toward
cutting the tax on capital gains, both supporters and opponents
agreed today.
   ``I think we have on my side a slight margin at the present
time,'' said Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., chief sponsor of the
capital-gains cut. ``I think it's a very close vote.''
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., who is fighting the reduction, told
reporters after a closed Democratic caucus on the issue he still
does not see enough votes to block the cut. But, he said, ``I think
we can catch up.''
   Republicans held their own strategy session, where the
Democratic plan of substituting liberalized Individual Retirement
Accounts for a lower capital-gains tax was portrayed as an excuse
to raise taxes. IRAs would be financed by a tax increase on
top-income Americans.
   ``It's exactly the kind of tax increase ... (Democrats) proposed
in 1984,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip.
``I think we'll find the extra five or six votes necessary to win.''
   The capital-gains cut is one of numerous divisive issues
attached to a deficit-reduction bill the House is considering.
   The 2,000-page bill would reduce the deficit by $16.6 billion
during the budget year that begins Oct. 1, enough to meet
requirements of the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law and avoid
automatic spending cuts in most federal programs.
   Because the legislation is so important and considered by some
to be veto-proof, it has become the vehicle to carry numerous
amendments _ many having nothing to do with cutting the deficit.
   But President Bush said Tuesday he would continue his fight for
a lower capital gains tax even if it ties up the bill and triggers
across-the-board cuts.
   ``A president has to use the tools at his disposal to accomplish
the ends for which he was elected,'' Bush said. ``And I plan to do
exactly that.''
   As the sparring on capital gains was taking on more urgency,
votes were expected today on lesser provisions. One would block a
decline in the 8 percent airline ticket tax and other aviation
taxes, and one would repeal a 1986 law requiring employers to prove
their health insurance plans do not discriminate against lower-paid
workers.
   The House is to decide Thursday between a capital gains tax cut
and a Democratic alternative to expand tax-deductible Individual
Retirement Accounts.
   Votes are likely next week on proposals to repeal or modify
catastrophic medical insurance for retirees and to boost benefits
for child care for low-income families.
   The Democratic leadership, hoping to recover from a defeat in
the House Ways and Means Committee on the capital gains issue, is
instead proposing to expand IRAs.
   Bush contends a cut in taxes on capital gains _ profits from the
sale of stock and other assets _ would spur saving and create jobs.
Democrats say liberalized IRAs would serve the same purpose and
provide more benefit to those with lower incomes.
   At the White House on Tuesday, Bush told business leaders he
will fight for the tax cut even if that delays action on the
deficit bill and triggers automatic spending reductions.
   He said he would not accept the proposed IRA liberalization,
which Democrats want to finance by raising taxes on the wealthiest
600,000 couples and individuals. Bush also disputed Democratic
arguments that a capital gains cut is a windfall for the rich.
   ``I think we ought to stand up to the understandable political
rhetoric on the other side, rhetoric that we heard all last year
and that we're now hearing once again,'' he said.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., a former stockbroker, called the
capital gains plan ``a quick fix for a quick profit for those who
earn over $200,000 a year.''
   As the House began what is expected to be a week and a half of
debate on the spending bill, few members bragged about the massive
package.
   Some complained that many of the deficit reductions are phony,
simply shifting costs from one budget year to another. Others
criticized the use of amendments that do nothing to cut the deficit.
   Some measures would outlaw ``obscene'' dial-a-porn phone
services; renew tax benefits for a variety of special interests;
raise the amount that Social Security recipients may earn without
losing part of their pensions; boost assistance for the poor, and
write into the law the Fairness Doctrine, which would require
broadcasters to air all sides of issues.
   ``This is the melting pot act,'' said Rep. Steven Schiff, R-N.M.
``It seems that every issue we have been debating in the 101st
Congress is a part of this bill.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, said that in packing the bill, lawmakers signaled ``our
willingness to bow to any special-interest group that is aggressive
and single-minded enough to hound us into submission.''

   OPEC ministers today struck a deal to boost their
production ceiling a modest amount in the final months of the year,
but two cartel members indicated they would not go along.
   Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman, president of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said the countries
would lift their supply cap by a million barrels a day to 20.5
million barrels.
   Algeria declared the move illegal and Kuwait, who has been
openly exceeding its production limit, said it had made no
commitments.
   The head of the Algerian delegation, who demanded anonymity,
said, ``It is something that Algeria doesn't associate itself
with.''
   ``It is a decision that is illegal,'' he said immediately after
the ministers' final round of talks at a luxury Geneva hotel.
   ``As far as we can see, it has kind of poor thinking behind
it,'' he said.
   Kuwaiti oil minister Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah said his country
would continue not to recognize any restrictions on its output. He
said Kuwait had made ``no commitments either legal or moral to hold
down production.''
   The disarray came in the fifth day of talks held to try to come
up with an acceptable production strategy in the final quarter of
the year.
   The ministers were at odds throughout the meeting over how much
they could raise any production ceiling without sending prices
sliding.
   Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena, who left the meeting
Monday to return to Algiers for a legislative meeting, had pressed
for retaining the current ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day.
   He had said the cartel should concentrate on bringing prices up
about a dollar to the cartel's benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   Others argued the market was strong enough to absorb the
additional supply.
   The ministers failed to come up with a formula for meeting some
countries' demands for a higher share of OPEC's production.
   ``We solved a good deal,'' Iraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi
said before the meeting. ``Maybe we'll leave something for
November.''
   The ministers were scheduled to meet in late November to plan
their production strategy for 1990.
   The officials had spent the day studying a surprise Iranian
proposal to see if it could form the basis of a compromise. But
they deferred taking any action on the plan.
   In its plan, Iran proposed the production ceiling be pegged
above 20.5 million barrels a day to take care of demands by Kuwait,
the United Arab Emirates, Gabon, Ecuador and Qatar. It could go as
high as 21.5 million barrels to cover them.
   ``It's a good proposal,'' said a senior Kuwaiti delegate, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   As sketched by Iranian delegates, their formula would give all
13 countries larger individual quotas, meaning they could produce
more crude in the last quarter than now. But Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Gabon, Ecuador and Qatar would be given bigger
percentage shares.
   Each country is assigned an individual quota, based on its
percentage share of the total. For example, Saudi Arabia, the
cartel's No. 1 producer, has nearly a 25 percent share of the total
supply.
   Before the latest proposal, the members were considering a Saudi
plan to push production up to 20.5 million barrels a day, according
to a delegate. All countries would share proportionately in the
increase.
   OPEC ministers have been meeting since Saturday to find a way to
raise their output ceiling in the last quarter without sending
prices tumbling. The talks had been on the verge of collapse Monday
evening.
   Crude prices have held fairly steady in recent months, despite
reports that some members have been overproducing.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the key American brand, closed up 7 cents
on Tuesday at $19.53 a 42-gallon barrel, well above the cartel's
benchmark $18 a barrel.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>U.S. Cement Manufacturers Cry Foul Over Mexican Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of seven cement manufacturers have
complained to federal officials that Mexican competitors unfairly
are selling cement in the United States at cut-rate prices.
   The manufacturers committee, made up of producers in Texas,
Arizona, New Mexico and Florida, said it filed petitions Tuesday
with the U.S. International Trade Commission and the U.S. Commerce
Dept. asking for duties on imports of gray portland cement large
enough to eliminate any price differential.
   ``Dumping cement in U.S. markets cannot be allowed to
continue,'' said Clarence C. Comer, chief executive of
Houston-based Southdown Inc. and head of the manufacturers group,
which claims the U.S. price for the imported cement is about
one-half what Mexicans are charged.
   ``If we lose out to fair competition from Mexico, so be it,''
Comer said. ``Our investigation to date, however, convinces us that
the Mexicans' success in U.S. markets is due to dumping and not to
any other factor.''
   Since 1983, the group said, seven cement plants have closed in
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas with two more closing in Florida.
   Last year Mexican imports accounted for 14 percent of the market
in the three border states and 22 percent of the Florida market,
the group said.
   ``Mexican producers continue to build export-oriented capacity
aimed at American markets,'' Comer said. ``We don't want to see
imports stopped, or to deter fair competition, but when dumping of
cement hurts U.S. companies and workers, the time has come to
enforce United States laws against unfair import practices.''
   Besides Southdown, the manufacturers are Box Crow Cement Co.,
Midlothian, Texas; Florida Crushed Stone Co., Brooksville, Fla.;
Gifford-Hill and Co., Dallas; Ideal Basic Industries, Denver;
Phoenix Cement Co., Phoenix; and Texas Industries Inc., Dallas.

<UNK>Auction House Says Japanese Company Bought Holmes a Court Stake</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christies International PLC, the fine art auction
house, said Wednesday that Australian financier Robert Holmes A
Court sold his 7.2 percent stake in Christies to Aska International
Co. Ltd. of Tokyo.
   Christies also posted a 66-percent surge in net profit for the
half-year on strong growth in art sales and general gains in market
share.
   Christies Company Secretary David Allison said the auction house
wasn't certain what Aska's ultimate goals were in acquiring Holmes
a Court's stake.
   ``Whether it's friendly or not, we don't know,'' Allison said.
``We don't want people to think anything mysterious is going on.
It's just too soon to tell. We haven't been contacted by Aska yet.''
   Holmes a Court's Carisbrook Holdings U.K. Ltd. acquired the
stake in Christies in December. It notified the auction house of
its intention to sell the holding early last week.
   Christies said its net profit for the six months ended June 30
increased to 20.1 million pounds, or $33 million, from 12.1 million
pounds in the same period a year ago.
   Pre-tax profit rose 67 percent to 34.3 million pounds against
20.6 million pounds a year earlier.
   Earnings per share climbed to 11.81 pence, or 19 cents, from
7.23 pence.
   Sales rose 56 percent to 90 million pounds from 57.6 million
pounds.
   Christies' shares were up 3 pence at 302 pence on London's Stock
Exchange Wednesday. They were up more than 20 pence earlier in the
day.

   Five months after spurning a takeover bid from
NCNB Corp., Citizens and Southern Corp. has agreed to a $4.7
billion merger with Virginia-based Sovran Financial Corp. to create
the nation's 14th-largest banking company.
   Atlanta-based C&amp;S and Sovran announced the deal Tuesday, saying
the merger has been discussed over the past two years. The combined
banks, which will maintain separate headquarters under a new
holding company, will have assets of $47 billion and 976 offices in
seven states plus Washington, D.C.
   The new company will be calle Avantor Financial Corp.
   ``We are creating a large, nationally competitive franchise with
a powerful presence in major high-growth markets, and we're
underwriting it with superior credit quality,'' the two banks said
in a joint announcement.
   ``We feel it's a perfect fit,'' said C&amp;S spokesman Scott
Scredon. ``We don't overlap, our management cultures are very
similar, and we each double our market presence. We both feel it
couldn't be any better.''
   In terms of assets, the merger would create the nation's
14th-largest bank holding company.
   The friendly nature of the merger was in stark contrast to the
mood in April, when Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB targeted C&amp;S in a
$2.4 billion takeover bid that would have created the nation's
sixth-largest bank.
   Bennett A. Brown, C&amp;S chairman and designated head of the
combined company, told securities analysts in New York today that
the C&amp;S-Sovran merger wasn't in reaction to NCNB's unwanted offer.
``We started conversations two years ago,'' he said.
   NCNB also issued a statement today dismissing speculation that
it might want to re-enter the picture, since its previous offer
would now be worth about $54 a share, substantially higher than the
approximately $34 of stock that C&amp;S shareholders would receive
under the merger with Sovran.
   During a tense, monthlong courtship by NCNB, C&amp;S officials
refused even to discuss the deal. NCNB eventually withdrew the
offer, saying it did not want to get involved in a long fight.
   Brown said C&amp;S' board of directors saw greater long-term value
in the deal with Sovran than in the ``short profit'' shareholders
would have received from NCNB.
   ``This is an extremely friendly deal,'' said Lacy Shockley, a
banking industry analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Uphan &amp; Co. in
New York. ``NCNB was unusually hostile. Here, you have two very
similar banks. This is the truest merger of equals I've ever seen.''
   Ginny Mackin, an NCNB spokeswoman, Tuesday declined to comment
on the C&amp;S-Sovran merger. ``We don't comment on what other banks
do,'' she said.
   Scredon said the boards of the two institutions approved a
definitive agreement Tuesday. He said final approval from
shareholders and regulatory agencies is expected during the first
quarter of 1990.
   Under the merger agreement, each of Sovran's 59.8 million shares
of outstanding common stock will convert into 1.23 shares of the
new company's common stock.
   Each of C&amp;S' 62 million shares of outstanding common stock will
convert into one share of the new company's common stock, worth
about $34.87.
   C&amp;S Chairman Bennett A. Brown will become chairman and chief
executive officer of the new company while retaining his position
at C&amp;S. Sovran Chairman Albert B Gornto will become chairman of the
new company's executive committee and will retain his position at
the Norfolk, Va.-based bank.
   Dennis C. Bottorff, president and chief operating officer of
Sovran, will be president and chief operating officer of Avantor
and become chief executive officer of the new company upon Brown's
retirement. At that time, Hugh Chapman, now president of C&amp;S, would
become chairman of Avantor.
   C&amp;S has 489 bank offices in Georgia, Florida and South Carolina.
Sovran has 487 offices in Virginia, Maryland, Tennessee, Kentucky
and Washington, D.C.
   ``It's a big deal,'' said Ms. Shockley. ``It's going to create
the powerhouse in the Southeast.''
   She said the merger is likely to spur more such activity in the
region. ``It puts pressure on other Southeastern banks to do
something,'' she said.
   Katherine Hart, an analyst at Interstate Johnson Lane in
Atlanta, said, however, that while the merger greatly increases the
banks' presence, it is premature to predict what effect it will
have on earnings.
   ``Size itself does not make you automatically better than
everyone else,'' Ms. Hart said.

   Shares closed slightly lower Wednesday on
continued nervousness over the direction of British interest rates
and corporate profitability.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished down
4.9 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,332.0 and off its session high of
2,335.2.
   The key index, however, staged a modest recovery in late
dealings. It had slipped as much as 14.4 points to 2,321.7 in the
early afternoon.
   The Financial Times 30-share index settled 6.1 points lower at
1,907.4. The Financial Times 500-share index closed at 1,303.98,
down 3.76 points.
   Volume came to 428.9 million shares, down from 450.8 million
shares Tuesday.
   Some dealers said that the market was supported mostly by the
lack of buyers at the lower levels, which prevented aggressive
selling, and the continued firmness of key components of the
100-share index.

<TEXT>
   Sponsor dropouts nearly placed the ``World of
Audubon'' specials on the TBS SuperStation on the endangered list,
but Turner Broadcasting System has come to the rescue.
   Sponsors, including Sears, Ford, Exxon, Citicorp, Michelin and
New York Life, pulled their advertisements before the show aired
Sunday night because of a program about trees last weekend that
drew criticism from the logging industry.
   The special, ``Ancient Forests: Rage Over Trees,'' about the
destruction of Pacific Northwest forests, was shown Sunday night
without sponsorship. It is to be shown again Saturday, Monday and
Oct. 16.
   Turner Broadcasting System officials said Tuesday that the cable
TV network will stand by the show through its new three-year
contract.
   TBS would not say how much it lost in advertising revenue when
the sponsors withdrew their commercials, but the National Audubon
Society said TBS lost $250,000 and the program's overall corporate
sponsor, the Stroh Brewery Co., earlier withdrew about $600,000 in
production money for the series.
   Chris Palmer, executive producer of the program and vice
president of National Audubon Society productions, said Stroh had
asked him to change his film before it withdrew. He said loggers
had boycotted Stroh beer in August.
   ``We did hear from the logging industry. They were asking for us
to ensure the content was accurate,'' said Stroh spokeswoman Lacey
Logan, denying that a boycott was called. ``Anytime there is a
grassroots level campaign, there are lots of different emotions.''
   Gerry Hogan, president of entertainment networks for TBS, said
in a statement that the company would continue its support of the
program ``despite pressure from special-interest groups.''

<TEXT>
   The Arizona Insurance Department said today it
will require a formal hearing and review before deciding whether
Hoylake Investment Limited can acquire Farmers Insurance Company of
Arizona as part of its attempt to take over BAT Industries PLC.
   BAT has been resisting the $21 billion takeover attempt by Sir
James Goldsmith and co-investors in Hoylake, and today's decision
will buy the company additional time.
   ``While we continue to believe the Insurance Department legally
lacks jurisdiction to consider the Hoylake proposal, we're
confident that the Department will ultimately approve it,'' said
Jack LaSota, a Hoylake attorney.
   Hoylake has said it plans to sell the Farmers Insurance unit to
Axa Midi Assurances if it acquires BAT, aand state Insurance
Director Susan Gallinger said in a formal order today that the
proposed sale to Axa Midi would be considered at the same time as
the proposed acquisition by Hoylake.
   She set a hearing for Oct. 16.
   Hoylake and BAT, both of which are headquartered in England,
have been battling in states across the United States over Farmers
units that now belong to BAT's BATUS Inc. subsidiary.
   Lawyers for BAT, formerly British American Tobacco, have used
many of the same arguments that they opposed earlier when its was
Farmers' turn to resist a BATUS takeover attempt.
   Hoylake announced its takeover intentions on July 11.
   Farmers, Arizona's second-largest auto and home insurer and
fifth-largest commercial insurer, wrote $270 million in direct
premiums in Arizona last year.

   Stock prices fell in midafternoon trading today
after an up-and-down session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 8.73 at 2,655.21
as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street. It had fallen about 10 points in the
early going and then briefly rose to stand slightly above even at
noon.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 526 up, 826 down and
525 unchanged.
   The market had to contend with renewed weakness in the dollar
and an accompanying rise in credit-market interest rates.
   It also was weighed down by International Business Machines
Corp.'s disclosure that it expects earnings for the third quarter
to come in well below current estimates by analysts.
   IBM shares fell 6 to 111{, and some other technology issues also
were weak. Digital Equipment dropped 1[ to 93~, and Apple Computer
lost } to 44{ in the over-the-counter market.
   But brokers said buyers were encouraged by takeover news and
rumors, notably in the entertainment industry, that seemed to ease
recent fears that Wall Street's boom in buyouts and mergers might
be nearing an end.
   Columbia Pictures Entertainment, which agreed to be acquired by
Sony Corp. for $27 a share, rose \ to 26{ in heavy trading.
   Paramount Communications, another prominent factor in the
entertainment business, gained 1[ to 57].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

   The leader of the striking Eastern Airlines pilots
Wednesday said they are ``appalled'' at Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner's opposition to government intervention into the
strike.
   Skinner disclosed Tueday he has written to Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and called a proposed
congressionally mandated committee ``entirely inappropriate.'' Such
a move ``can only hinder the work of the bankruptcy court,''
Skinner wrote.
   The Senate may consider a version of a House of Representatives
bill passed in March that would force President Bush to establish
an emergency board, or blue-ribbon commission, to investigate and
make recommendations on the dispute between Eastern and its three
major labor unions.
   ``We urge the members of the Senate, who have followed the
course of this struggle for almost seventh months and who
understand both the issues and will of the voters, to look beyond
the limited vision of the Secretary's letter,'' said Skip Copeland,
recently elected to head the pilots local.
   Copeland said 1988 Department of Transportation and Federal
Aviation Adminstration probes of Eastern operations were ``fatally
flawed whitewashes.'' Copeland said the pilots union had withheld
criticism of the FAA probe, which Copeland said found safety
deficiencies that could have warranted shutting down Eastern,
because it was hoped promised safety improvements and cooperation
would save the airline.
   A new investigation would examine past practices. Current
Eastern operations, he said, are ``on a very thin margin of
safety.''
   ``They're trotting out the old red herring of safety,'' company
spokesman Robin Matell said. ``It's an obvious act of desperation
by the pilots union in response to Eastern's ability to rebuild
successfully despite ALPA's efforts to shut the airline down.''
   Eastern's three unions went on strike March 4, and Eastern filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days later. Eastern
is trying to rebuild without the unions and says it will emerge
from bankruptcy at about two-thirds its prestrike size.
   Copeland said Eastern's rebuilding plan is ``a controlled
liquidation that signals the demise of a once-proud company'' and
he said despite Skinner's comments, he didn't think President Bush
could ``in good conscious'' veto the bill if passed by the Senate.
   Skinner said that while the Bush administration regrets that the
strike wasn't resolved by mediation, it believes government should
not take over in management-labor disputes. He also noted that
Eastern is in the jurisdiction of federal bankruptcy court.
   Skinner told Mitchell the court is the proper place to handle
the dispute unless it threatens safety, in which case the DOT would
get involved. He argued that Congress has ``no appropriate role''
and said he would urge Bush to veto the bill if it is passed.

<HEAD>Bank, Two Officers Accused in $35 Million Student-Loan Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A savings and loan and two former officers
have been indicted on charges of conspiracy, theft and fraud in
connection with the student-loan program, federal prosecutors said
Wednesday.
   Florida Federal Savings Bank, through its student-loan division,
submitted fraudulent insurance claims for 17,000 students totaling
$35 million, said Gregory W. Kehoe, assistant U.S. Attorney for
Florida's Middle District.
   He said the claims were supported by documents falsely showing
that attempts were made to collect.
   Florida Federal received some $18 million from the Department of
Education before the agency ``shut the door,'' Keohoe said.
   Named as defendants with the St. Petersburg-based thrift were
Robert O. Harmas, 42, of Noblesville, Ind. and James J. LaMantia,
59, of Largo.
   The doctored claims were submitted between Novemmber 1986 and
July 1987, the 43-count indictment states.
   At the time, Florida Federal, formerly Florida Federal Savings
and Loan Association, was the second largest thrift in the
Southeast and the third largest provider of guaranteed student
loans in the country, authorities said.
   Harmas was a vice president and operations manager of the loan
division; LaMantia was assistant vice president and manager of
collection and claims.
   The loan program makes low-interest loans available to students
to pay for postsecondary education. Lenders lend their own funds
and the federal government or a guarantee agency insures against
loss due to default by a borrower.
   ``The students never had an opportunity to repay the loans,''
Kehoe said. ``There's no evidence the claims or proper documents
were ever sent to them.''
   Kehoe said evidence indicated the money went to the bank.
   Each count carries a maximum penalty on conviction of five years
in prison and $50,000. The prosecutor said the defendants were
expected to surrender.

   A Dallas company tried to win a $400 million
contract to build mail-sorting equipment by ``buying'' a member of
the U.S Postal Service's board of governors, a federal prosecutor
charged today.
   In opening statements at the fraud and conspiracy trial of
Recognition Equipment Inc. and two of its top officers, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Joseph Valder said the firm's chief executive
officer, William Moore, became ``obsessed'' with getting a major
postal contract.
   In an attempt to achieve his goal, said the prosecutor, Moore
and his co-defendant, REI Vice President for Marketing Robert
Reedy, sought help from Peter Voss, a member of the postal
service's board of governors.
   At Voss' urging, REI hired a small consulting firm headed by
Detroit-area businessman John Gnau, Valder said. REI arranged to
pay $325,000 to Gnau's firm in little more than a year, the
prosecutor said, with a portion of the proceeds being funneled to
Voss.
   ``This case is not about aggressive-but-legal business
practices,'' said Valder. ``It's about the fact that'' Moore and
Reedy ``cheated ... they lied ... they stole ... they covered up.''
   ``The case is about Moore and Reedy blocking government
functions by deceit,'' Valder said.
   Moore and Reedy were involved in a scheme to ``defraud the
government by buying a governor,'' he said.
   Voss, who headed Ronald Reagan's 1980 Ohio presidential
campaign, received a four-year sentence in 1986 after pleading
guilty to taking an illegal gratuity and to expense account fraud.
   Gnau, who headed Reagan's 1980 Michigan campaign, was sentenced
to three years for conspiracy and paying an illegal $2,500 gratuity
to Voss.
   The case is being heard by U.S. District Court Judge George
Revercomb because attorneys for REI, Moore and Reedy waived their
clients' constitutional right to a jury trial.
   Jenny Haynes Barker, REI vice president, said the case is so
complicated that it would best be handled by a judge.
   If convicted, Moore and Reedy would each face a maximum of 33
years' imprisonment and $1.5 million in fines. Both men are on paid
leaves of absence. They have maintained their innocence and say
they plan to return to their former jobs if exonerated.
   A seven-count indictment in October 1988 followed an
investigation by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and a federal
grand jury into details of competition for a computer automation
contract with the postal service.

   Wheat futures prices were mainly higher, corn
prices drifted lower and soybean futures were mixed at the close
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean prices were depressed by a forecast of good harvest
weather with no frost threatened and better than expected early
harvest yields, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Wheat prices had opened higher, then drooped due to a noticeable
lack of commercial buying, but rebounded later in the session on
news of ``a strong export demand,'' said Jerry Zusel, manager of
CBOT floor operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Corn slipped lower from lack of any major demand, Zusel said.
   At the close, wheat was 2} cents lower to 3} cents higher, with
December at $3.98 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1} cents lower, with

   Forget elevator music.
   Teen-agers hanging out near the Merry-Go-Round clothing store in
the Eastlake Square Mall in Tampa, Fla., weren't bopping to a
homogenized version of the Who or synthetic Bruce Springsteen.
   The piped-in music featured original recordings of hip rhythms
by Paula Abdul, Bobby Brown, Taylor Dayne, Jody Watley and others.
   The teens' enthusiasm for the sounds caused a temporary tiff
between Merry-Go-Round and the mall's management, who worried that
a horde of teen-agers could cause problems, recalls Kristy Collar,
a troubleshooter for the retailer.
   The situation, which has been sorted out, is an extreme example
of what can happen when retailers or restaurants play the right
music: Tunes _ not just merchandise and food _ can attract
potential customers.
   Merry-Go-Round Enterprises Inc. is one of many clients of AEI
Music Network Inc., a firm that designs what it calls
``marketing-oriented music profiles'' that appeal to particular
customers.
   ``Our approach to the entertainment medium of music is to use
music as a marketing tool,'' says AEI President Michael J. Malone,
a former financial analyst who came up with the concept for the
company after helping a friend whose cassette player in his
restaurant kept going on the blink.
   By way of explanation, Malone says the profile for Victoria's
Secret, the intimate apparel store owned by specialty retailer
Limited Inc., calls for elegant, classical melodies that wouldn't
be out of place in a boudoir.
   Limited's Express shops pipe in European pop to complement the
international flair Express tries to get across to customers
seeking entry to the forefront of world fashion. The retailer's
flagship chain prefers a mixture of top 40, jazz, contemporary
tunes and light rock 'n roll to make the buttoned-down, blazered
set feel at home.
   Retailers changing their merchandise mix might need a face lift
for their musical profiles. When safari wear seemed to be going out
of style Gap Inc.'s Banana Republic chain switched from Fantasy
Island-type melodies and bird calls to contemporary jazz, says
Malone.
   Marketing experts say music is an important element of the
atmosphere within stores and elsewhere. Tailoring an
establishment's ambience to a specific target market can work
wonders for business.
   ``It's very clear that music affects behavior, especially in
terms of shopping behavior,'' says Ronald E. Milliman, a marketing
professor at Western Kentucky University.
   Research on the subject is limited, Milliman says, but it is
believed that music can improve store image, make employees
happier, reduce stress and stimulate purchases.
   A poll by the Gallup Organization Inc. done for AEI said 91
percent of store patrons surveyed thought music had an effect on
their actions. The respondents said music could induce good moods
and boost energy levels. AEI contends that customers who feel
comfortable in stores might spend more time there and wind up
spending more money.
   AEI, which claims to have pioneered the idea of programming
original artist music, is regarded as the leader in the field. The
privately-held Seattle company supplies sound for most major
restaurant chains and scores of retailers, hotels, banks and other
places where music is heard. It also handles in-flight music for
numerous airlines.
   Besides offering advice on which music would suit a specific
audience, AEI helps with selection and installation of sound
systems.
   But most important, it provides a constantly updated collection
of tapes that fits into various categories ranging from ``smooth
savoir faire'' featuring swing, blues and sultry numbers, to ``hot
&amp; hip,'' a mixture of current pop favorites, light funk, dance,
reggae and foreign hits.
   To preserve the mood during special seasons like Christmas, a
dash of traditional fare can be blended into the mix.
   ``People would get suicidal if you blasted White Christmas at
them all day,'' says Malone.
   The music on AEI's tapes are original recordings, not special
arrangements made just for the tapes. AEI negotiates with artists
to use their work and works closely with the distribution arms of
record companies.
   A casual listener might think they're hearing a commercial-free
radio station instead of an AEI tape. Playing radio stations in
stores is a marketing no-no because competitors' ads might be heard.
   ``Music can have a great impact on a comfort zone,'' says
Malone, referring to how an atmosphere affects a listener.
   Obviously, not everyone has the same taste in music.
   So, next time you're blasted out of a trendy boutique by
ear-piercing rock with a chest-pummeling beat, consider this: Maybe
you're not the type of customer that the retailer expects to shop
there.

<HEAD>Suit: Cane Cutters Underpaid $30 Million in Six Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar cane harvesters have filed a
lawsuit claiming they have been underpaid by more than $30 million
during the past six seasons by south Florida growers.
   The lawsuit, filed Monday as an amended class-action to include
more than 10,000 workers who have worked for six companies since
1982, alleges that sugar cane harvesters were not given proper
credit for the amount of cane cut.
   The original lawsuit was filed in Palm Beach County Circuit
Court in August on behalf of four Jamaican farmworkers. In a
separate action Monday, the growers filed a motion to dismiss the
original lawsuit.
   Defendants named in the suit are the Sugar Cane Growers
Cooperative, Atlantic Sugar Association, United States Sugar Corp.,
Okeelanta Corp., Osceola Farms and Cane Contractors.
   Under the federal government's guest-worker program, growers can
hire foreign cane cutters if the companies can show there are not
enough U.S. citizens willing to work for the minimum task rate of
$5.30 for each ton cut. Growers then submit to several state
employment centers ``clearance orders'' that explain the work, the
rate of pay and how much work is expected each day.
   The clearance orders cited in the suit stated that workers were
to average one ton per hour for eight hours a day, according to Jim
Green, a lawyer for the cane-cutters.
   For that work, according to the clearance orders, harvesters
were to be paid at a rate of $5.30 a ton, the attorney said. The
lawsuit claims the workers received $3.50 per ton and $4.25 per ton.
   But Charles Caulkins, an attorney for the growers, said the six
companies contend the clearance order calls for payment per hour,
not per ton.

   Hasbro Inc. said it will no longer use
white rats, rabbits and other animals to test children's cosmetics
for safety.
   The decision follows similar announcements by adult cosmetic
manufacturers. Animal-rights activists have staged two
demonstrations at Hasbro's plant here in the past two years and
urged consumers to boycott Hasbro cosmetics.
   ``We certainly applaud Hasbro's decision,'' said Steven Ruggeri,
New England director of Friends of Animals. ``I think it's the most
enlightened approach.''
   Hasbro spokesman Wayne Charness said Tuesday the company has
used animals to test 15 products in the past six years. He did not
identify the products, but said the tests verified they were safe
if swallowed and did not irritate eyes or skin.
   ``We've always been sensitive to both sides of the issue and
always made a policy of avoiding tests on animals whenever
possible,'' he said. ``Because there was such a limited amount of
products (requiring animal testing), we decided to eliminate it.''
   Charness declined to say whether the protests influenced
Hasbro's decision.
   Animal-rights activists have said tests to determine whether the
products are safe for eyes caused the rabbits unnecessary pain
because their eyes do not produce tears to wash the substances away.
   Avon Products Inc. and Revlon Inc., two of the biggest
manufacturers of adult cosmetics, recently announced they would
replace animal tests of new toiletries with computer models,
existing safety records and human volunteers.

   Columbia Pictures Entertainment isn't top dog
in Hollywood these days. But in the global marketplace, the studio
has enormous potential, which is why Sony snapped up Columbia on
Wednesday for $3.4 billion.
   The buyout will yield a fully-integrated company combining two
prominent players in entertainment hardware and software, giving
Sony a repository of films and television programs to show the
world over _ preferably on Sony equipment.
   Sony now can control an entertainment property from start to
finish _ owning the movie, the movie theater, the snack bar, the
soundtrack album, the television series adaptation and the VCR and
stereo system on which the movie and album can be played.
   While not in the same league as the $14 billion Time-Warner
merger earlier this year _ which created the world's biggest media
concern _ the Sony-Columbia pact does share the same motivation:
survival in the booming international entertainment emporium.
   Sony's new multinational enterprise is the result of a yearlong
effort by the Japanese electronics giant to establish a Hollywood
foothold. It marise in credit-market interest rates.
   It also was weighed down by International Business Machines
Corp.'s disclosure that it expects earnings for the third quarter
to come in well below current estimates by analysts.
   IBM shares fell 5~ to 111|, and some other technology issues
also were weak. Unisys was off } at 18~, Digital Equipment dropped
1] to 93|, and Apple Computer lost { to 44} in the over-the-counter
market.
   But brokers said buyers were encouraged by takeover news and
rumors, notably in the entertainment industry, that seemed to ease
recent fears that Wall Street's boom in buyouts and mergers might
be nearing an end.
   Columbia Pictures Entertainment, which agreed to be acquired by
Sony Corp. for $27 a share, rose \ to 26{ in heavy trading.
   Paramount Communications, another prominent factor in the
entertainment business, gained 1[ to 57].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.14 to 191.31. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 0.17 at 382.36.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 153.53 million shares at 3 p.m.

   A high-fiber, zero-calorie flour substitute and
a plastic engine are among the winners of this year's R&amp;D 100
awards for inventions, Research and Development magazine said
Wednesday.
   Other winners chosen by the magazine include a miniaturized
television or computer screen that fits over one eye, a device that
converts letters on a computer screen to Braille, and a system for
making sure infants are getting enough oxygen to their brains.
   The 100 awards, for what the magazine called ``the most
innovative and significant technological advances that have
resulted in new products in the past year,'' were to be presented
Thursday at a ceremony at the Museum of Science and Industry in
Chicago.
   ``We had less original creative work this year, fewer of what is
popularly referred to as a breakthrough, but more products that are
actually ready for use by consumers,'' Robert Jones, editor of the
Des Plaines, Ill.-based magazine, said in a telephone interview
Wednesday.
   The research centers of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration won six awards, followed by Du Pont Co. with four
and the Argonne, Oak Ridge and Los Alamos national laboratories
with three each.
   The award for the flour substitute was won by J. Michael Gould
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Peoria, Ill. The product
makes it possible to bake reduced-calorie breads and increase the
fiber content of frostings, pie fillings, puddings and snack foods.
   Gould said several companies have taken out patent licenses to
produce the substance and speculated some may already be using it
as a secret ingredient.
   The award-winning predominantly plastic internal-combustion
engine provides an unusually high one horsepower per pound: it is
175 pounds and provides 175 horsepower, its developers say.
   The engine was designed by Matthew Holtzberg of Polimotor
Research Inc. of Franklin Lakes, N.J., with plastic developed by
Rogers Corp. of Manchester, Conn. It is under evaluation by an
unnamed U.S. automaker, Rogers said.
   Allen Becker of Reflection Technology in Waltham, Mass., won for
a matchbox-sized eyepiece that gives the wearer the illusion of
looking at a 12-inch-diagonal computer or TV screen. The two-ounce
Private Eye can be hooked in front of one eye with a headset or
attached to a hand-held computer, the company says.
   The Braille ``mouse'' that permits blind or visually impaired
people to read computer screens was invented by H. Douglas Garner
of NASA Langley Research Center in Langley, Va. No companies are
manufacturing it yet, Langley officials said.
   Hamamatsu Photonic Systems Corp. of Bridgewater, N.J., won for a
system, already on the market, that prevents brain damage in
newborns by monitoring the flow of oxygen to their brains. The
measurement is done by transmitting harmless infrared light through
their heads. Hamamatsu worked with University College in London.
   A gyroscopic stabilizing system for personal camcorders that
takes the jitters out of home video was invented by Mitsuaki Oshima
of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. of Osaka, Japan.
   Du Pont won for Hivcheck, a five-minute test for the presence of
antibodies to the AIDS-causing HIV virus. It was originally
developed for use in Third World countries and can be performed
with minimal training and no special equipment.
   Sandia Laboratories of Albuquerque, N.M., won two awards for a
system that harnesses small computers together to solve complex
engineering problems that usually take expensive supercomputers.
   The magazine's scientist of the year award went to Justin
Rattner, director of technology at Intel Scientific Computers in
Beaverton, Ore. He was cited for his contributions to the
development of parallel processing in computers.
   The winners were chosen by editors and past editors of the
magazine as well as scientists and engineers on its advisory board.

<TEXT>
   Final approval of former Ohio financier
Marvin Warner's $16 million bankruptcy settlement plan was delayed
Wednesday because of questions over court costs, a family trust and
interest on back taxes.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George Proctor set a Nov. 19 deadline to
solve the problems.
   The judge said he wants to either confirm a plan to settle
Warner's personal bankruptcy case, dismiss it, convert it again to
a Chapter 7 liquidation or handle it some other way under Chapter
11 reorganization.
   The biggest problem is a dispute with the Internal Revenue
Service over back taxes and interest owed by Warner.
   Warner's tax attorney, Bart Brown, testified that discussions
with the IRS showed that Warner owes $2.5 million in taxes plus
$3.7 million in interest for a total of $6.2 million. The IRS has
filed a claim against Warner's estate for $13 million.
   Under the proposed plan, Warner said he will pay the IRS back in
yearly installments over six years. At dispute is the amount of
interest Warner will have to pay during the period.
   Also at issue is dissolving a Warner family trust containing
some of the money needed for settlement. Attorneys said they need a
Circuit Court judge in Ocala to approve dissolving the trust, which
they said could happen in under a month.
   Warner also must pay legal fees ordered by the court or reach an
agreement with attorneys before the next hearing.
   Warner's creditors have approved the settlement and it has
cleared critical court hearings in Ohio and Fort Lauderdale.
   Under the proposal, Warner immediately would pay $10 million and
make three annual payments of $2 million beginning with the first
anniversary of the plan's approval.
   Ohio officials said the state will accept $8 million because
Warner can't afford the $22 million a court ordered him to pay as
restitution for bailing out his failed thift, Home State Savings
Bank of Cincinnati. Creditors will divide the other $8 million.
   At a hearing Monday in Fort Lauderdale, Thomas Tew, the
court-appointed trustee representing investors of defunct ESM
Government Securities Inc., backed the plan.
   Fort Lauderdale-based ESM was closed by federal regulators in
March 1985. Home State, which lost about $144 million in ESM
investments, collapsed four days later and triggered a crisis among
Ohio thrifts.
   Tew said the ESM-related creditors will receive about $1.28
million under the settlement, leaving Warner about $5 million and
his 153-acre Ocala horse farm.
   Warner, 70, who was flooded with $4.5 billion in lawsuits
following Home State's collapse, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in October 1987.
   Warner is appealing a felony conviction in Ohio in connection
with the Home State collapse, but has been acquitted of federal
charges in a separate trial.

   A slowdown in public works projects helped push
the level of new construction contracts down 3 percent in August, a
survey found.
   The latest setback followed a brief period of stability
nationwide for new construction of all types, according to the F.W.
Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information Services Co., which
conducted the survey.
   The survey found that overall construction last month declined
to $252 billion after a 2 percent rise to $256.6 billion in July.
   Contracts for public works projects fell 10 percent to an annual
rate of $42.4 billion, the lowest value in six months, reflecting
``budgetary restraint on the funding for construction of highways,
bridges and other infrastructure work,'' the survey said.
   August contracts for new residential construction were
relatively unchanged from July at $118.6 billion. A decline in
multi-family construction was offset by a gain in hotel contracts.
One-family home contracts remained steady.
   ``Starts of one-family units haven't changed significantly since
April, despite the decline in mortgage rates since that time,''
said George A. Christie, economist for F.W. Dodge.
   Non-residential building slipped 2 percent in August to an
annual rate of $91 billion.
   For the first eight months of the year, the unadjusted figure
for all newly started construction totaled $175.8 billion, down 1
percent from the same period in 1988.
   Only the North Central region showed an increase _ 3 percent _
in building contracts over the first eight months of last year. The
northeastern and western sections of the country were unchanged
from last year and the South was down 4 percent.

   Stock prices were widely mixed today in an
on-again-off-again session.
   The market had to contend with some renewed weakness in the
dollar and an accompanying rise in credit-market interest rates.
   Prices of long-term government bonds declined slightly,
increasing their yields to the 8.25 percent-8.30 percent range.
   Stocks also were weighed down by International Business Machines
Corp.'s disclosure that it expects earnings for the third quarter
to come in well below current estimates by analysts.
   But brokers said buyers were encouraged by takeover news and
rumors, notably in the entertainment industry, that seemed to ease
recent fears that Wall Street's boom in buyouts and mergers might
be nearing an end.

   At Wells Fargo Bank, a long wait in line is
money in the bank.
   Starting Wednesday, any checking account customer who waits more
than five minutes in a teller line at Wells Fargo Bank branches in
California will be credited $5.
   ``For nearly two years, we've had a program in our branches
called Five Minute Max, in which our goal is to have customers
reach the teller window in less than five minutes,'' said Don
Routh, vice president in charge of the program.
   ``We were the first California bank to develop this program, and
now we are the first to guarantee consistently fast service to our
customers.''
   Under the program, a customer waiting more than five minutes
will be given a ``guarantee'' form to turn in to a bank employee.
The branch will keep the form and add $5 to the customer's checking
account.
   The $5 will show up on the customer's monthly bank statement.

<TEXT>
   Adolph Coors Co. may have to juggle nearly
two dozen brands of beer until it decides which ones will fail if
its proposed purchase of Stroh Brewing Co. is finalized, analysts
say.
   The Golden-based brewer has offered $425 million for most of the
Detroit-based Stroh's assets. The proposal is subject to the
approval of the boards of directors of both companies and the
Justice Department.
   Officials have said they don't expect it to be finalized before
early next year.
   Coors' best known brands _ Coors, Coors Light and Coors Extra
Gold _ are ranked as premium, one notch below the top quality of
super premium.
   Its other brands include Herman Joseph's, Herman Joseph's Light
and Killian's Irish Red, in the premium category; and Keystone and
Keystone Light in the popular category.
   Stroh's most popular brands are Stroh's and Stroh's Light, in
the popular price category, and Old Milwaukee and Old Milwaukee
Light in the low-priced economy category.
   Its other brands include: Signature, super premium; Schlitz and
Schlitz Light, popular; Schaefer, Schaefer Light and Piels,
economy; and Schlitz Malt Liquor, Red Bull and Silver Thunder, malt
liquors.
   Benj Steinman, an associate publisher of the Beer Marketer's
Insights newsletter, said it only would be speculation at this
point to predict which brands would be eliminated.
   The number of brands will pose problems, but ``some of them
could be attractive to other brewers at the right price,'' he said.
   Some of the brands that would be competing against each other
are Coors' new Keystone brand and Stroh's Old Milwaukee.
   Some analysts said the brands most likely to succeed in the
newly merged company would be Coors, Coors Light, Schlitz Malt
Liquor and Old Milwaukee, which is the seventh best-selling beer in
the United States.

recently acquired Holly Farms Corp.
   Terms of the sale to ADM Milling Inc., which is subject to
approval by the Federal Trade Commission, were not disclosed by

   Knoxville-based White Lilly, a 107-year-old company with 150
employees that markets its flour and cornmeal products throughout

million through asset sales to ease more than $1 billion in debt.
   White Lily, along with two other Tyson flour milling companies _
Dixie Portland Flour Mill Inc. and Dixie Portland of Georgia _ have
agreed to sell their operating assets and related liabilities to
ADM Milling.
   ADM Milling is a subsidiary of Archer Daniels Midland Co. It is

   With several big-name department stores seeking new owners, the
U.S. retail industry may be looking at a $4 billion clearance sale.
   In an industry already reeling from the effects of financial
difficulties facing one major store operator, some of the nation's
most famous department store chains are on the block in sales that
analysts estimate could reap more than $4 billion.
   Two respected chains catering to affluent customers, Saks and
Marshall Field's, became the latest to go on sale as their parent
company, BAT Industries PLC, launched a major realignment of
operations.
   By undoing some of its diversity, the British conglomerate hopes
to thwart a $22 billion takeover charge led by financier Sir James
Goldsmith.
   BAT will sell its American retail holdings but keep its
lucrative tobacco and financial services businesses in a plan to
boost its worth to shareholders and keep them loyal to current
management.
   Arthur Martinez, senior vice president in charge of retail
operations at BATUS Inc., BAT's American arm, expressed optimism
about the intention to sell the retailing businesses, which was
announced Tuesday.
   ``We have working for us the lack of a distress sale environment
and some splendid properties,'' he said in an interview. ``I'm very
confident of our ability to get a satisfactory price.''
   The BAT-owned retailers joined trend-setting Bloomingdale's on
the auction block. Bloomingdale's has been on the market for
several weeks due to the problems of its debt-encumbered owner,
Campeau Corp.
   The Canadian holding company might be forced to part with other
pieces of its vast retail collection, depending on orders from its
financial rescuer, Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.
   If high fashion isn't to everyone's tastes, May Department
Stores Co. wants to sell its Caldor and Venture discount chains.
   And if this isn't a big enough selection, U.S. stores belonging
to Australia's troubled Hooker Corp., including the B. Altman &amp; Co.
and Bonwit Teller chains, may be in the market for new owners.
Hooker's U.S. subsididary, L.J. Hooker Corp., is restructuring
after filing for bankruptcy court protection from creditors.
   ``There's an awful lot of retail property on the block right
now. It may make some available at very attractive terms _ and I
don't mean junk debt,'' said analyst Janet Mangano of Josephthal &amp;
Co. Inc.
   Bidders with the wherewithal to make a mostly cash offer could
be in the driver's seat if they're steering toward a retail
acquisition, said Mangano.
   But the glut means a desperate seller like Campeau probably
can't count on getting as much money as desired.
   Gilbert Harrison, chairman of Financo Inc., a merger advisory
firm specializing in retail industry transactions, said Saks and
Bloomingdale's are world-class businesses that will lure many
potential buyers from the United States and abroad.
   Two possible bidders have revealed their intentions toward
Bloomingdale's: the chain's chairman, Marvin S. Traub, and Crown
American Corp., a big U.S. shopping mall developer.
   As many as 10 other individuals or groups reportedly are
considering whether to pursue the New York-based, 17-store chain.
   Non-retail groups might be reluctant to bid for the stores in
light of the predicaments of Campeau and Hooker, which both were
more sure-footed in real estate when they ventured into U.S.
retailing.
   For one thing, non-retailers are unaccustomed to the amount of
credit management that's involved in buying merchandise that might
sell out quickly or linger on shelves if fickle consumers change
their buying habits.
   ``I am distressed to see how many retail properties are for sale
at the same time,'' said Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. analyst Walter Loeb.
He said heavy debt loads have put unbearable pressure on retailers
and led many of them into trouble.
   On top of the $1 billion or so analysts expect Bloomingdale's
might sell for, there's the roughly $1.5 billion that Caldor and
Venture should fetch.
   St. Louis-based May, which itself is mentioned as a possible
pursuer of Saks or Bloomingdale's, has about 120 Caldor stores and
about 73 Venture outlets. May owns the Lord &amp; Taylor chain.
   BAT's retail businesses would go for at least $2 billion,
analysts said. New York-based Saks has 46 stores from coast to
coast, and Chicago-based Marshall Field's operates about two dozen
stores in Illinois, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin.
   Field's chairman, Philip B. Miller, is considering a
management-led buyout of the chain but he has not disclosed what
price might be offered.
   Among BAT's other U.S. retail businesses are Ivey's, a
Charlotte, N.C.-based chain of 20-plus stores, and Breuners of San
Ramon, Calif., which has nearly four dozen furniture stores and
rental outlets.

   Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.'s
$3.4 billion purchase by Japan's Sony Corp. adds another chapter to
the up-and-down history of a scrappy little studio that rose from
Poverty Row to become a major force in Hollywood.
   For Sony, the deal announced Wednesday means another big
foothold in the U.S. entertainment industry for the giant
electronics manufacturer.
   Sony, which bought CBS Records for $2 billion last year, has
been seeking properties that will provide the records and movies it
hopes consumers will use with its stereos and videocassette
recorders.
   Columbia's attractiveness stems from its successful stable of
television productions, as well as the storied studio responsible
for such movies as ``It Happened One Night,'' ``On The Waterfront''
and ``Ghostbusters.''
   Columbia's rise was led by bombastic founder Harry Cohn, dubbed
``White Fang'' by writer Ben Hecht. Commenting on Cohn's
well-attended funeral in 1958, Red Skelton cracked on his
television show: ``It only proves that if you give the people what
they want, they'll turn out for it.''
   Columbia began in 1920 as the C.B.C. Film Sales Co., using the
initials of its founders, brothers Harry and Jack Cohn and Harry
Brandt. The quality of their initial films prompted the movie trade
to call the company Corned Beef and Cabbage; the founders changed
the name to Columbia Pictures in 1924.
   Harry Cohn operated a tiny studio on Hollywood's Poverty Row
alongside other shoestring producers. Columbia's growth accelerated
with the advent of Frank Capra in 1928, during which he directed
seven films. Capra's movies of the 1930s _ including ``It Happened
One Night,'' ``Lost Horizon,'' ``Mr. Deeds Goes to Town'' and ``You
Can't Take it with You,'' _ helped establish Columbia as a major
studio.
   Cohn and Columbia produced some of the most popular and
sophisticated films of the Thirties and Forties _ ``One Night of
Love,'' ``The Awful Truth,'' ``Here Comes Mr. Jordan,'' ``Gilda,''
``The Jolson Story,'' ``Cover Girl,'' ``All the King's Men.'' Among
the Columbia stars were Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, William Holden,
Kim Novak, Broderick Crawford and Judy Holliday.
   In 1952, Cohn broke Hollywood's opposition to television and
formed a subsidiary, Screen Gems, to produce TV series. The film
division continued to thrive with such hits as ``Born Yesterday,''
``From Here to Eternity,'' ``On the Waterfront,'' ``The Caine
Mutiny'' and ``The Bridge on the River Kwai.''
   Columbia's television arm remains hugely profitable, making $155
million on revenue of $620 million in the company's last fiscal
year, ended Feb. 28.
   The death of Harry Cohn in 1958 coincided with the end of the
big-studio era. Columbia became host to a number of independent
producers such as Sam Spiegel (``Lawrence of Arabia''), Ray Stark
(``Funny Girl,'' ``The Way We Were''), Carl Foreman (``The Guns of
Navarone''), Otto Preminger (``Anatomy of a Murder''), Stanley
Kramer (``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'') and Mike Frankovich
(``Cactus Flower'').
   Once located in the heart of Hollywood, Columbia sold its famous
Sunset and Gower studios in the late 1960s and moved production
facilities to The Burbank Studios, which it shares with Warner Bros.
   Columbia's unsteady course continued during the 1970s and in
1982 it was acquired by Coca-Cola Co. The marriage between the
soft-drink empire and the entertainment company worked for a time.
   Thanks largely to ``Ghostbusters'' and ``The Karate Kid,''
Columbia's share of the 1984 box-office receipts was 21 percent.
Another Coca-Cola subsidiary, Tri-Star Pictures, claimed 5.3
percent of domestic theater admissions. Warner Bros. had 23 percent
and Paramount 22.6 percent that year.
   But despite Coca-Cola's attempts to inject its production and
marketing techniques into the movie business, its film divisions
declined. Tri-Star could not produce a solid hit and Columbia
sponsored the disastrous ``Ishtar.''
   Columbia's stability also was undermined by unsteady management.
The studio had a parade of bosses, including David Begelman, who
was deposed in an embezzlement scandal;, Francis (Fay) Vincent, who
now is commissioner of major league baseball; Frank Price and David
Puttnam, producer of ``Chariots of Fire'' and ``The Killing
Fields.''
   After taking over Columbia in late 1986, Puttnam said he
wouldn't follow the Hollywood establishment trend toward bigger
budgets and higher salaries for stars. The stand quickly alienated
powerful producers, directors, actors and talent agents, including
actor Bill Murray, director Norman Jewison, producers Ray Stark and
Martin Ransohoff and the Creative Artists Agency.
   After less than a year, Puttnam he was replaced by movie
producer Dawn Steel.
   In 1987, Coca-Cola combined Columbia and Tri-Star into a new
company, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and retained a 49 percent
interest while distributing part of its interest to Coca-Cola
shareholders.
   During Coca-Cola's ownership, Columbia's Loews Theatre
Management Corp. took off. Loews, acquired in 1986, is among the
nation's five biggest chains, with more than 800 screens in 220
locations.
   While Columbia's television division, boosted by such shows as
``Who's the Boss?,'' ``227'' and ``Designing Women,'' flourished,
its motion-picture arm drifted. Steel has relied on a variety of
projects like ``Ghostbusters II,'' ``The Karate Kid III'' and
``Casualties of War,'' none of which have been runaway hits.
``Casualties of War'' has been a box-office bomb.

   Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. of Atlanta said
Wednesday its merger with Virginia-based Sovran Financial Corp.
creating the nation's 14th-largest banking company was not a
reaction to an earlier hostile bid by NCNB Corp.
   ``This is not a reactionary thing. ... We started conversations
(with Sovran) two years ago,'' Bennett A. Brown, C&amp;S chairman and
designated chief executive officer of the new combined company,
told a meeting of securities analysts in New York.
   He said those negotiations weren't revealed at the time of
NCNB's stock-swap offer last April because the bid, valued at
around $44 a share, or $2.4 billion, was too pricey.
   Citizens' had claimed the value of NCNB's stock was inflated
after its takeover of the banks of the First RepublicBank Corp of
Dallas last year.
   ``Sovran didn't have the capacity to be a `white knight,'''
Brown said. ``We were never considering an acquisition of each
other ... only a merger of equals.''
   The C&amp;S-Sovran agreement, announced Tuesday, would give Sovran
control of 53 percent of the combined bank holding company _ to be
known as Avantor Financial Corp. _ and C&amp;S a 47 percent stake.
   Under the deal, Sovran shareholders would receive 1.23 shares of
Avantor for each of their 59.8 milliion common shares outstanding.
Citizen shareholders would get one share for each of their 62
million outstanding shares. The agreement is conditioned upon
approval from shareholders and bank regulators.
   Wall Street gave the deal a luke-warm reception Wednesday. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, C&amp;S closed down
25 cents to $34.62{ while Sovran fell 75 cents to $41.37{.
   The merger creates the nation's 14th-largest bank holding
company with $47 billion in assets, $34 billion in deposits and 976
branches in eight states in the Southeast.
   Besides creating a regional powerhouse, the deal also represents
the second-largest bank merger in the United States, behind the
combination of Bank of New York Co. and the Irving Bank Corp.
earlier this year.
   Brown said C&amp;S' board of directors saw greater long-term value
in the deal with Sovran than in the ``short profit'' shareholders
would have received from NCNB.
   ``The mutual attractions are largely due to the cultural
similarities,'' Brown said.
   He noted the combined banking company will have double market
power but little overlapping operations in Maryland, Virginia,
Kentucky, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and
Wshington, D.C.
   Brown said Avantor had more growth potential on the consumer
level than most larger money-center banks because it wasn't bogged
down by problem loans to less developed countries. Only $50 million
of Avantor's $31 billion total loan portfolio includes Third World
debt, he said.
   ``I believe we're well armed to address the future challenges of
the 1990s,'' added Hugh M. Chapman, C&amp;S president and chief
operating officer.
   Sovran Chairman Albert B. Gornto will serve as chairman of the
executive committee of Avantor.
   During Wednesday's meeting, at least one analyst speculated NCNB
might want to re-enter the picture since its previous offer would
now be worth about $54 a share, much higher than the approximately
$34 of stock C&amp;S shareholders will get under the Sovran merger.
   But Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB, which withdrew the previous
offer after C&amp;S refused to even discuss the deal, dismissed such
speculation.
   In a brief statement Wednesday, it said it would continue its
strategy of acquiring thrifts in Texas and the Southeast.

   Central banks sold dollars for a third straight
day Wednesday, pushing the currency lower after an agreement last
weekend that it had risen too much in recent months.
   The losses left the dollar 4 percent lower against the West
German mark and Japanese yen than it was late last week, back to
its levels of late July and early August.
   The central banks squashed a rally attempt at midmorning in New
York. Still, the slight rebound in the dollar signaled to some
traders that the official bankers had won the battle against the
$300 billion-a-day currency market, but not yet the war.
   ``Do they want it to get off the mat or do they want to kick it
while it's down? Assuming they're playing a serious game I think
you'd go for the kidneys now rather than later,'' said Charles
Taylor, an international economist at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. in Washington.
   A strong dollar tends to swell the U.S. trade deficit by making
imports cheap and pushing up the price of American goods in foreign
markets. At a meeting in Washington, finance leaders of the Group
of Seven industrial nations agreed Saturday that the dollar's rise
was ``inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals.''
   Traders said the frequency of sales rather than their size was
pushing down the dollar.
   The dollar fell against all major currencies except the Canadian
dollar, which often moves in tandem with the U.S. dollar, and the
British pound, which was weighed down by a worse-than-expected
trade deficit report.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6155 from $1.6215 late
Tuesday. In New York the pound fell to $1.6167 from $1.6190.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.45 Japanese yen to a closing 141.35
yen. Later, in London, it dropped further to 139.45 yen. It was
quoted at 140.32 yen in late New York trading, down from 142.35
late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's rates, included: 1.8805 West German marks, down from
1.8918; 1.6305 Swiss francs, down from 1.6415; 1.1771 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1756; 6.3655 French francs, down from 6.4110;
and 1,361.7 Italian lire, down from 1,366.9.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8830 West German marks, down from 1.8885; 1.6305
Swiss francs, down from 1.6390; 6.3485 French francs, down from
6.3990; 2.1215 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1480; 1,359.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,377.00; and 1.1770 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1750.
   Gold bullion edged higher in active European trading. In London,
the metal rose to a late bid price of $368 a troy ounce from
$367.75 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, gold also rose to a late bid price of $368 from
$367.75 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.09 to close at a bid $369.92.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $367.60 an ounce from $368.50. Later, Republic
National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $366.20 an ounce,
down from $367.30 late Tuesday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.28 a
troy ounce, down from $5.31 bid late Tuesday. On New York's Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery fell to $5.245 an ounce from
$5.263 on Tuesday.

<HEAD>OPEC Ministers Break Up in Confusion, Agree on Higher Production
Cap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers Wednesday adjourned five days of
sometimes heated talks by raising their production cap only a
modest amount to try to strengthen crude prices in the coming
months.
   But the final accord still grossly understated the actual amount
of oil the cartel is believed to be producing, and at least three
members said they would refuse to recognize the deal.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, already producing beyond
their assigned limits, said they had no plans to restrain their
pumping. Algeria declared the deal illegal.
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said the group would raise its
output ceiling by a million barrels a day to 20.5 million barrels,
from 19.5 million, for the final three months of the year. Various
estimates put OPEC's actual production at closer to 22.5 million
barrels a day.
   The meeting of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries ended in confusion after the ministers failed to resolve
their deep divisions. Several countries reportedly had asked for a
bigger share of the pie.
   Crude oil prices fluctuated during the talks as investors
awaited a decision.
   Some analysts predicted the cartel's decision would translate
into even higher production and dampen prices.
   Fergus MacLeod, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London,
said, ``It means oil prices could weaken a bit from now on.''
   ``On the consumer side, it may portend slightly lower prices,''
said Michael Rothman, analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in
New York.
   West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, was off about
a dime at midday but closed 6 cents higher at $19.59 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile exchange.
   A basket of crudes monitored by OPEC had been trading about a
dollar off the cartel's target of $18 a 42-gallon barrel.
   Lukman said the extra production would be divided
proportionately among all 13 members. Each country's quota, or
supply target, would be raised by a certain amount.
   Lukman said the arrangement should mean slightly lower
production. ``We'll see a lot better prices,'' he predicted.
   Indonesia's oil minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said he felt
positive about the agreement.
   ``The others are worried prices will go down,'' he said. ``I
think at the minimum they will stay level.''
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been ignoring their
quotas to press their demands for bigger shares.
   Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti oil minister, said he made no
commitments ``either legal or moral to anybody'' to hold down
production.
   The United Arab Emirates' Mana Saeed Otaiba said he did not
intend to go along with the deal, according to Ginandjar.
   Sabah predicted demand would rise to 23 million barrels a day in
the October-December quarter.
   ``Hopefully,'' he said, ``that will keep prices at very near
(OPEC's) reference price.''
   Others, however, have estimated demand for OPEC oil at 22
million barrels.
   The decision to increase the ceiling was made after the
ministers struggled for a day with a surprise Iranian plan to solve
the output demands of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
   After failing to do so they settled on the stopgap measure.
   Immediately after the decision was announced, the head of the
Algerian delegation, who demanded anonymity, said, ``It is
something that Algeria doesn't associate itself with.''
   ``It is a decision that is illegal,'' he said, adding it was
based on ``poor thinking.''
   The Algerian minister, Sadek Boussena, returned to Algiers on
Monday to attend a legislative meeting. Before his departure, he
had urged the participants to concentrate on getting prices up to
the cartel's $18 target.
   The ministers were at odds throughout the meeting over how much
they could raise any production ceiling without sending prices
sliding.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said that if prices tumbled much,
the ministers would gather again. OPEC has already planned a
meeting for November to plan production strategy for 1990.
   The ministers said they intended to take up the Iranian plan
again at that meeting.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said his proposal would
raise the supply ceiling to 21.5 million barrels a day. This, he
said, would satisfy the demands of Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates, Gabon and Ecuador for bigger slices of the production pie.
   Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and Qatar would retain their current
shares. All others would lose some.
   ``This would be the basis to solve the problems of OPEC
hopefully for good,'' Aqazadeh said.
   He said Libya and the United Arab Emirates could not immediately
go along with the plan. Libya has demanded the same share as Kuwait.
   Each country is assigned an individual quota, based on a formula
of percentages. For example, Saudi Arabia, the cartel's No. 1
producer, has nearly a 25 percent share of the total supply.
   Several OPEC members, such as Kuwait and the UAE, believe they
are entitled to larger quotas based on production capacity.
   OPEC members include Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   International Business Machines Corp.'s stock
sank Wednesday, putting a drag on the broader market, after the
company said it expected earnings for the quarter to be below
analysts' forecasts.
   The stock dropped at the opening bell and ended up down $6 a
share to $111.50 on heavy volume of more than 5 million shares.
   IBM is the most valuable company in the United States as
measured by its market value and is a component of the Dow Jones
industrial average of 30 stocks. The average managed a gain of 9.12
points to 2,673.06, but it would have risen more without IBM's drop.
   Besides its quarterly troubles, IBM said that if the effects of
the stronger dollar and the shift to leasing by IBM customers
continues for the rest of 1989, ``it will also be difficult for IBM
to achieve full-year results within the current range of
estimates.''
   The rise of the dollar hurts reported earnings of multinationals
such as IBM by cutting the dollar value of profits that are made in
foreign currencies. The shift to leasing from buying cuts into
short-term revenue by spreading out payments received from placing
new products with customers.
   In addition, IBM said profits were being hurt in the
July-September quarter by the transition to a new range of
products, which increases costs and temporarily depresses revenue
by interrupting sales of the older lines.
   IBM Chairman John F. Akers said demand for IBM products and
services continues to be good worldwide. He said the company
expects growth in all major geographic areas for the year, with the
rate of growth continuing to be stronger outside the United States.
   IBM had been expected to earn about $2.22 a share in the current
quarter, according to a survey of 23 security analysts by the
Institutional Brokers Estimate System of Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan. The
range of estimates was $2.14 to $2.28.
   Frank Metz, IBM's chief financial officer, told an analyst that
net earnings in the current quarter would be measurably below the
$1.95 a share in operating earnings the company had a year ago,
spokesman Peter Thonis confirmed.
   For the full year, the average estimate of 42 analysts had been
$10.36 a share and the range was $10 to $10.80, the estimate
service said.

<HEAD>Export Demands Push Grains Lower, Oil Up on OPEC Snags</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Exports demand pushed down grain futures prices Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade while crude oil futures rose amid
OPEC-member opposition to an accord increasing the cartel's
production ceiling.
   On other markets, wheat prices were mixed, corn drifted lower,
livestock and pork fell and precious metals declined.
   ``There's been very strong export demand for wheat,'' said Jerry
Zusel, manager of CBOT floor operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Zusel said Egypt late Tuesday tendered for 500,000 metric tons
of wheat and the Agriculture Department on Wednesday morning
targesed Egypt for 1 million metric tons of export bonus wheat.
   Soybean prices were depressed by a forecast of good harvest
weather with no frost threatened and better than expected early
harvest yields, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader in Chicago for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The soybean contract for November reached a seven-week low of
$5.64 during the day.
   Wheat prices were mixed, weakened by a lack of commercial buying
while supported by strong export demands, traders said. Corn
slipped lower from lack of any major demand.
   Wheat settled 3} cents lower to 4\ cents higher, with December
at $3.98{ a bushel; corn was } cent to 1} cents lower, with
December at $2.28} a bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent higher,
with December at $1.44{ a bushel; and soybeans were \ cent to 1{
cents lower, with November at $5.65\.
   Crude oil futures prices moved higher when news reached the New
York Mercantile Exchange of OPEC member opposition to an Iranian
proposal to increase the oil cartel's production ceiling for the
rest of the year.
   Meeting in Geneva, OPEC ministers struck a deal to boost their
production ceiling a modest amount in the final months of the year
to 20.5 million barrels. But Algeria and Kuwait indicated they
would not go along.
   Heating oil prices were up, as support came from Tuesday's
American Petroleum Institute inventory report, said Jim
Ritterbusch, vice president of trading and research for Carson
Petroleum Co. in Chicago.
   Unleaded gasoline futures were mostly lower.
   Crude oil settled 6 cents to 24 cents higher, with November at
$19.59 a barrel; heating oil was .70 cent to .90 cent higher, with
October at 58.46 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 1.64
cents lower to .27 cent higher, with October at 58.74 a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, futures prices for livestock
and pork were mostly lower.
   Prices for live hogs and frozen pork bellies moved lower as
traders, awaiting Friday's hog inventory report from the
Agriculture Department, were concerned over some weakness in the
cash markets, said Paul Hare, an analyst in Chicago with Linnco
Futures Inc.
   Sizeable deliveries of cattle to farmer markets weighed on
cattle futures, he said.
   Live cattle settled .23 cent lower to .25 cent higher, with the
contract for October at 72.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05
cent to .32 cent lower, with September at 83.10 cents a pound; live
hogs were .15 cent higher to .25 cent lower, with October at 43.20
cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .38 cent
lower, with February at 48.27 cents a pound.
   Futures prices for precious metals were lower on the Commodity
Exchange in New York.
   ``Several central banks took dollar down again, but gold was not
able to rally,'' said Jim Steel, metals analyst in New York from
Refco Inc.
   ``The traditional relationship between the dollar and gold is
not there right now, because of the presence of longtime
fundamentals _ inflation is low and interest rates are coming down.
Neither make gold very attractive,'' he said.
   Silver has been suffering from overproduction, he said.
   Gold settled 50 cents to $1 lower, with the contract for
delivery in September at $367.60 a troy ounce; and silver was 1.8
cents to 2.2 cents lower, with September at $5.245 a troy ounce.

   John M. Richman, vice chairman of Philip Morris
Cos. and chairman and chief executive officer of Kraft General
Foods, plans to retire at the end of the year, the company
announced Wednesday.
   The company said that Michael A. Miles, president and chief
operating officer of Kraft, will succeed Richman as chief executive
officer immediately. Miles is also expected to be nominated as vice
chairman, it said.
   Richman, who joined Kraft in 1954 in the company's legal
department, was elected Kraft chairman in 1979.
   He was named vice chairman of Philip Morris in 1988 after the
company's $12.9 billion takeover of Kraft that year.
   Richman is leaving the consumer products giant to become counsel
to the New York law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, Philip
Morris said.

   Crude oil futures seesawed in hectic trading
Wednesday before closing higher after OPEC announced it had agreed
to raise its official production limit by 1 million barrels a day.
   Observers said that while the agreement legitimizes part of what
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is already
producing, it still undershoots the cartel's actual production,
believed to be above 22.5 million barrels a day.
   The new accord raises the official ceiling to 20.5 million
barrels a day in the fourth quarter from 19.5 million in the third
period.
   ``They're getting closer to institutionalizing what they're
already doing,'' said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the
energy group at Elders Futures Inc. ``So it didn't solve any
questions.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, closed 6
cents higher at $19.59 a barrel after trading as much as 30 cents
under Tuesday's close of $19.53.
   Among refined products, heating oil for October delivery rose
0.75 cent to finish at 58.46 cents a gallon and November added 0.84
cent to 58.90 cents.
   Unleaded gasoline for delivery in October dipped 1.64 cents to
58.74 cents a gallon.
   It was the third straight decline in as many days after a sharp
increase last week on news that a big refinery in the Virgin
Islands had sustained severe hurricane damage and would be closed
for 60 days. The refinery, owned by Amerada Hess Corp., supplies
markets in the eastern United States.
   ``The market is saying that it overreacted to the Hess refinery
damage,'' said Bob Baker, analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   Baker, as well as other market analysts, predicted that crude
prices in coming weeks would ``fluctuate along with the temperature
in OPEC'' in advance of the regularly scheduled meeting in November
of the oil group. But no sharp fluctuations are anticipated, they
said.
   Observers have already predicted that OPEC would make yet
another change in its production ceiling at the next meeting.

   Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., the
storied producer of such movies as ``Ghostbusters'' and TV hits
like ``Who's The Boss,'' agreed Wednesday to a $3.4 billion cash
buyout by Sony Corp.
   The deal comes 21 months after the huge Japanese video and audio
equipment maker bought CBS Records for $2 billion. It marks the
biggest step of Sony's push into the ``software'' side of the
entertainment business that will provide products such as movies
and records to complement its stereos, televisions and
videocassette recorders.
   The agreement also extends the recent trend of foreign buyouts
of Hollywood studios that has gobbled up MGM-UA Entertainment Co.
and 20th Century Fox.
   Sony said it intended to allow Columbia's U.S. management
independence in day-to-day operations, but some top-level changes
are expected.
   Columbia said its president and chief executive, Victor A.
Kaufman, and its chief operating officer, Lew Korman, intend to
resign on completion of the buyout.
   There were published reports that movie producer Peter Guber was
expected to replace Kaufman. Guber, who co-produced ``Batman,''
``Rainman,'' and ``Flashdance,'' is considered one of Hollywood's
top producers.
   The deal should provide a big payday for Coca-Cola Co., which
stands to collect $1.45 billion in gross proceeds from selling its
49 percent stake in Columbia under Sony's $27 a share offer.
Coca-Cola signed an option agreement with Sony to tender its nearly
54 million shares of Columbia stock, subject to approval by
Coca-Cola's board, which is expected to meet Monday. The investment
firm Allen &amp; Co. Inc. signed an option agreement to sell its 3
percent stake.
   Coca-Cola declined comment on what it intends to do with the
cash, but analysts speculated that it would reinvest in its
soft-drink operations and possibly repurchase some of its stock.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Columbia rose 25
cents a share at $26.50 while Coca-Cola rose 50 cents a share to
$64.62{.
   Sony reportedly has been looking for a movie studio for more
than a year in an effort to extend its reach into new areas of the
entertainment business that it already serves as a dominant maker
of consumer electronics.
   Michael Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America, said
he had held informal discusssions with Columbia executives for
about a year but that the talks got serious only in the past week.
He said Sony decided on a proposal this past weekend and presented
it on Monday.
   Sony's U.S. subsidiary, Sony USA Inc., intends to launch its
tender offer by next Tuesday and expects to complete the
acquisition by early November.
   The deal had been widely rumored since Monday, when Columbia
disclosed it was in buyout talks with a third party that it refused
to identify. Sony confirmed early Wednesday from Tokyo that it had
made an offer.
   Columbia Chairman Donald R. Keough, who also is president of
Coca-Cola, said Sony was ``an ideal buyer.''
   ``It has all the right characteristics and very importantly has
the ability to take the company to its next important step,'' he
said.
   Columbia began as a tiny studio in 1920 and grew into a major
Hollywood force, placing fourth with 14 percent of 1989 domestic
box-office revenues through Sept. 4, according to the trade journal
Variety.
   Its owns two film studios, Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star
Pictures, but its box-office results have been considered
disappointing in recent years. Among its most recent releases have
been ``Ghostbusters II,'' ``The Karate Kid Part III'' and
``Casualties of War.''
   It has been more impressive in television, where it has produced
or distributed 11 prime-time series, including five new shows.
   Coca-Cola has been involved in Columbia since 1982, when it
bought a predecessor company. Coca-Cola subsequently launched a new
studio called Tri-Star Pictures in a joint venture with CBS Inc.
and Home Box Office Inc.
   In late 1987, Coca-Cola merged its entertainment business with
Tri-Star and wound up with 80 percent of the company that was
called Columbia Pictures Entertainmment. It subsequently
distributed part of its interest in Columbia to Coca-Cola
shareholders and retained 49 percent.
   In its statement, Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive,
Roberto Goizueta, said Coca-Cola shareholders ``have benefited
significantly from our investment in the entertainment business
during the decade of the '80s.''
   But he said the company's ``core soft drink business offers
unequaled opportunity to expand our global leadership'' in the
1990s.
   Analysts said Columbia's huge library of more than 2,700 films
and more than 23,000 TV episodes should prove valuable to Sony.
   In the Columbia library are such films such as ``On the
Waterfront,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``The Bridge over the River
Kwai,'' ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ``Tootsie.'' Tri-Star films have
included ``The Natural'' and ``Rambo: First Blood Part II.''
   Its TV programs include ``Designing Women'' and ``Married ...
With Children'' as well as syndicated programs such as ``The
Jeffersons'' and ``Barney Miller.'' Its TV library includes the
series ``Father Knows Best'' and ``Route 66.''
   Columbia also operates 820 movie screens in 220 locations
through its Loews Theatre Management Corp.
   Columbia earned $16 million, or 14 cents a share, on revenue of
$1.62 billion in the fiscal year ended Feb. 28.

subject to regulatory approval, the Celtics said in a statement.
   Ralph Guarino, group president and director of WEEI, said the
deal should be completed in 60 to 90 days.
   WEEI, an all-news radio station purchased by Helen Broadcasting
in December 1983 from CBS Inc., has been broadcasting in Boston for
more than 60 years.
   Celtics co-owners Donald Gaston, Paul DuPee and Alan Cohen
raised about $48 million in 1986 by selling about 2.5 million
shares in the Celtics in a public stock offering.

<HEAD>Amway: Hirohito Death Slowed Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADA, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese Emperor Hirohito's illness and death
cut into Amway Corp.'s sales growth for the fiscal year that ended
Aug. 31, company officials said.
   Amway said growth in sales of its laundry and bath soaps and
more than 4,000 other home and personal care products dipped to 7
percent for the fiscal year from a 20 percent increase last year.
   Commerce in Japan, which accounts for 35 percent of Amway's
business, slumped during Hirohito's illness, William Nicholson,
Amway's chief operating officer, said Tuesday.
   ``All activity in Japan came to a stop because of that,'' he
said.
   Amway-Japan shut down completely during the three-day mourning
period following Hirohito's death Jan. 7.
   Without that impact, Nicholson estimated sales growth would have
been 12 percent. He said Amway's Japanese sales, which amount to
more than $500 million annually for the direct-sales giant, started
growing again early this year.
   Amway estimated retail sales by its more than one million
independent distributors at $1.9 billion worldwide for the fiscal
year, up from $1.8 billion in the previous fiscal year. The
privately held company does not report earnings.
   Nicholson said Amway's U.S. market, which accounts for 40
percent of sales, saw the largest increase in revenue and new
distributors.
   A failed attempt to take over Avon Products Inc., Amway's
largest rival, apparently helped sales in the United States last
spring. Nicholson had no explanation.

   Burger King Corp. on Wednesday unveiled an
advertising campaign featuring a new slogan and original songs by
well-known artists, less than six months after a marketing overhaul
at the nation's second-largest fast-food chain.
   The eight television and 10 radio spots, many featuring the
slogan ``Sometimes you've gotta break the rules,'' are scheduled to
air next month across the country.
   Burger King, which budgeted nearly $215 million for advertising
this year, replaced N.W. Ayer Inc. with two New York-based
advertising agencies in April and hired an executive from rival
Hardee's to help remold the company's image after several marketing
flops and sluggish sales.
   ``There will be a lot less emphasis on the product itself and
more of a focus on how people will perceive the company as a
whole,'' said Gary Langstaff, executive vice president for
marketing, who left No.3 Hardee's in April.
   Ayer, which held the Burger King account for about a year,
created the ``We Do It Like You'd Do It'' campaign. Analysts blamed
lackluster advertising, frequent management changes and
inconsistent quality for Burger King's recent failure to keep pace
with No. 1 McDonald's.
   Miami-based Burger King has average annual store sales of about
$1 million, compared with McDonald's nearly $1.6 million per store.
   The new television ads, designed by D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp;
Bowles and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, will premier Oct. 4. They
feature light-hearted sketches, including an aircraft carrier crew
anxiously awaiting its ``orders'' of hamburgers and a teen-age boy
fantasizing about a date in one of the restaurants.
   For the radio ads, top performers such as Mel Torme, blues
singer John Lee Hooker and rapper Tone-Loc wrote original songs
incorporating the new slogan. During a two-week period beginning
Oct. 1, the ads will be run about 1,000 times nationwide, said
Burger King spokeswoman Cori Zywotow.
   Spanish-language songs will be aired in several major Hispanic
markets, such as Miami, Los Angeles and San Antonio, Texas.
   Burger King, which laid off about a third of its 1,500
non-restaurant employees in April, also announced several new
programs for workers in conjunction with the new ad campaign.
   Employees selected by management for extraordinary customer
service will be featured in upcoming television commercials and
paid actors' wages. Also, employee ideas will be used in a redesign
of restaurant staff uniforms.
   The company plans to establish a toll-free customer complaint
and information line next year.
   ``A year from now, we will look much different,'' said Barry
Gibbons, chief executive officer of the Miami-based chain.
   Food and beverage giant Grand Metropolitan PLC of Great Britain
acquired Burger King from Pillsbury Co. in January. Burger King
operates about 5,900 restaurants worldwide and reported sales last
year of more than $5.4 billion.

<HEAD>Five Former F.D. Roberts Employees Plead Guilty to Stock Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former presidents of a defunct
penny-stock brokerage firm _ including a former federal securities
examiner _ were among five men who pleaded guilty Wednesday to
violating federal securities laws and bilking about $68 million
from investors.
   Sheldon Kanoff, 53, of Flushing, N.Y., a former president of
Paramus-based F.D. Roberts Securities Inc., confessed guilt before
U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan to two counts of securities
fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and
defraud the U.S. government.
   Kanoff became the 11th F.D. Roberts employee to plead guilty to
illegal practices in the penny-stock field. He had worked as a
chief examiner for broker-dealer inspection for the Securities and
Exchange Commission's New York office from 1970 to 1983, heading
investigations of securities fraud.
   Former F.D. Roberts president, treasurer and partner Albert
Weiss, 44, of Ramsey, pleaded guilty to one count of securities
fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. He
also admitted filing a false tax return in 1987.
   Both men admitted that from March 1985 to February 1989, F.D.
Roberts hired brokers with little or no experience and trained them
to badger customers into buying securities at inflated prices.
   Kanoff, a member of the firm's board who shared in its profits,
also told the judge that F.D. Roberts funds were used to pay
organized crime figures who had undisclosed interests in the firm.
   ``There was money owed to organized crime figures and money to
be paid to organized crime figures,'' said First Assistant U.S.
Attorney Michael Chertoff.
   Kanoff faces 15 years in prison and fines of up to $750,000.
Weiss faces a 13-year prison term and fines of up to $750,000.
Sentencing was set for November 14.
   Kanoff, Weiss and the three others who entered guilty pleas told
the judge that F.D. Roberts brokers used deceptive and manipulative
sales techniques to persuade customers to buy stocks the firm
usually controlled, and that false records were maintained.
   They also said some of those involved in fraudulent activity
would would maintain nominee accounts and profit by as much as 400
percent in one day.
   Earlier Wednesday, three former brokers _ John Landrum, 31, and
Kevin Zacharawicz, 35, both of Boca Raton, Fla.; and Fred Schneider
of Sparta _ pleaded guilty to stock fraud.
   Each faces a five-year jail term and a $250,000 fine.
   F.D. Roberts' had branch offices in New York, Florida and
California.
   Penny stocks are low-priced securities that are not listed on
any exchange.
   The firm, which has been under investigation by state and
federal authorities for about 1{-years, voluntarily closed in
February after the National Association of Securities Dealers
informed it that it fell below the minimum capital requirements.
   F.D. Roberts' former national sales manager, a former branch
manager, two assistant branch managers and two other brokers
already have pleaded guilty to using similar fraudulent practices
on clients.
   Four of the firm's top executives, including Kanoff, have been
banned by the NASD from working in the securities industry.

<DATELINE>HAMPTON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henley Group Inc., a conglomerate based in
Hampton and California with more than $4 billion in assets, will
split into two companies in December, the company announced
Wednesday.
   The move will continue Henley's program of creating new publicly
held companies ``to help enhance the value of its assets,'' the
company said in a statement.
   The two companies will be Henley Properties Inc., specializing
in real estate, and a new Henley Group Inc.
   Existing Henley stockholders will get one share of the new
Henley Group, an industrial company, as a tax-free distribution in
December for each share they hold in the existing company; what's
left will be renamed Henley Properties.
   The company said it filed a registration statement for the
distribution with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Wednesday.
   Henley Properties, with assets of more than $600 million, will
own the existing company's real estate developments and acreage in
Southern California, Hawaii, Wisconsin, Michigan and New Hampshire.
Michael Dingman, chairman and chief executive of the conglomerate,
will hold both titles in the new company as well.
   The new Henley Group Inc. will own the existing company's
remaining assets of about $3.5 billion. Included are two wholly
owned subsidiaries: Fisher Scientific Group Inc., which makes and
distributes laboratory and medical products; and Pneumo Abex Corp.,
which makes equipment for aircraft and friction-braking products
for cars, trucks and other vehicles.
   Cape Horn Methanol Ltd., now mostly owned by Henley, also will
be part of the new company. Cape Horn Methanol makes methanol from
natural gas in Chile.
   Henley Properties will include the existing company's wholly
owned subsidiary Signal Landmark Holdings Inc., which the company
described as a major developer of residential commercial and
industrial real estate, mainly in Southern California and Hawaii.
Henley said Signal Landmark also owns more than 300,000 acres of
recreational and residential real estate in northern Michigan and
Wisconsin.
   The company said Henley Properties also will own the existing
company's half-interest in Wentworth by the Sea, an oceanfront
project in New Castle consisting of a planned hotel at the site of
an old resort hotel, a 200-slip marina, a golf course and
restaurants and homes.

<HEAD>Sun Oil To Test New Fuels to Lower Emissions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RADNOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sun Co. on Wednesday announced it will begin
testing a series of reformulated fuels and gasolines in hopes of
lowering harmful emissions by 1993.
   The new fuels will include a reformulated diesel, a methanol mix
and unleaded gasolines.
   The first phase of the program will begin Nov. 1, when the
company plans to market the new diesel fuel at selected
Philadelphia-area service stations.
   The fuel is designed to meet stricter Environmental Protection
Agency standards scheduled to take effect in 1993. The fuel will
meet the proposed standard of 0.5 percent sulfur by weight, the
company said, and will maintain a cetane rating of 45. Cetane is
the diesel equivalent of a gasoline's octane rating.
   In January, the Armellini Trucking Co. will use the fuel on its
Florida-to-New England runs. Testing will compare tailpipe
emissions from the eight test trucks against emissions from four
trucks not using the reformulated fuel. The company said it expects
to see reductions in sulfur emissions of up to 80 percent.
   Sun plans three tests for its methanol mix, which will contain
15 percent gasoline. Sun does not manufacture methanol, but will
blend the mixture, known as M-85, using methonal purchased from
other producers.
   M-85 will be sold at selected Sunoco service stations in Detroit
and Washington, D.C., starting in early 1990, but will be sold only
to cars taking part in the experiment.
   Ford Motor Co. is cooperating with the study by providing
``flexible fuel'' cars that can run on either gasoline or a mixture
of methanol and gasoline up to 85 percent methonal, Sun said.
   Proponents of methanol claim substantial reductions in
hydrocarbon emissions, Sun said, but the company also plans to
examine the emission of formaldehyde, a gas that is an irritant.
   The third phase of the program involves new unleaded gasolines.
Sun currently markets gasoline under the Sunoco brand in 28 states
east of the Rockies as well as under the Atlantic brand in New York
and Pennsylvania.
   Several reformulated gasolines will be tested starting Dec. 1.
The reformulated gasolines will vary in composition, but all will
have reduced amounts of aromatics and olefins and increased amounts
of oxygen compounds, the company said.
   The tests will involve a variety of post-1975 cars that require
unleaded gasoline. The emissions will be compared with emissions
levels from comparable cars running on existing Sunoco Economy and
Ultra. Automobile performence also will be evaluated.
   The company expects to see reductions in carbon monoxide
emissions of up to 10 percent.
   The company declined to release information on how much the
tests or the new fuel mixes will cost.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday urged Western
nations to increase their financial support for Poland, and a top
Polish official appealed for $1.5 billion to help his nation cope
with a period of ``potentially explosive social conditions.''
   In his first address to the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, Bush praised the efforts of the
Solidarity-led government to handle the economic crisis facing
Poland.
   ``There may be no greater opportunity before us all today than
the challenge of Poland, and more broadly Eastern Europe _ where
countries are in the throes of dramatic political and economic
change,'' Bush told the delegates from 152 nations.
   The United States, Bush said, will be in the forefront of aid
efforts as Eastern Europe's first non-Communist-led government in
four decades struggles with soaring inflation, food shortages and a
huge foreign debt.
   He called on the IMF and the World Bank, the top international
lending agencies, and Western nations individually to boost their
aid for Poland.
   ``In light of clearly growing needs, the recent accession of a
Solidarity-led government and our self-evident stake in its
success, we must do more,'' Bush said.
   However, he immediately told reporters he's not prepared to
increase his $219 million U.S. aid package, saying any increase
will be hinged on the success of the reform measures being drafted
by the Polish government.
   The urgency of the situation was stressed by Polish Finance
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, who sought immediate assistance during
a round of meetings with finance officials attending the IMF and
World Bank meetings.
   Balcerowicz told reporters he wanted a $1 billion loan from
Western nations by early next year to provide critical reserves
needed to stabilize exchange rates. But Poland also needs up to
$500 million in short-term trade loans sooner to buy essential
foreign goods such as fertilizer and medical drugs, he said.
   ``The reform process, at least in its initial phase, will
proceed in extremely difficult and potentially explosive social
conditions,'' Balcerowicz said, pleading for Western aid to ease
the Poles' hardships.
   He said he wasn't disappointed that Bush didn't offer any
specific figures on how much the United States might boost its aid
proposal, saying he expected the details to be forthcoming.
   The administration is supporting a $119 million package of U.S.
economic aid to Poland and another $100 million in food aid.
Congressional Democrats have termed the package woefully inadequate
and called for more.
   Polish officials have sought $700 million a year over the next
three years from the IMF, and there were indications that the IMF
assistance program could be approved as soon as November.
   In his speech, Bush also stressed the need to keep pushing
forward with his initiative to ease the $1.3 trillion burden of
debt being carried by developing countries in Latin America and
elswhere.
   The IMF and the World Bank have been supporting the effort by
providing incentives to encourage commerical banks to forgive a
portion of their loans to poor nations. But banks have been
reluctant to support the plan because it requires them to partially
forgive old loans, then make new loans.
   Bush made an even more blunt appeal to a group of commercial
bankers at a White House reception Tuesday night, lobbying for the
debt-relief plan put forward by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters
Wednesday that twisting bankers' arms was a ``very foolish thing to
do.''
   ``Banks have to make their own decisions in light of their own
assessment of their long-term interests,'' he said.
   Later Wednesday, Argentine President Carlos Menem announced that
his country had reached agreement clearing the way for an IMF loan
to his nation, the third largest debtor in the developing world
with $60 billion owed.
   An IMF statement put the loan amount at $1.4 billion.
   Menem, in a speech after a morning meeting with Bush at the
White House, said Argentina was facing ``the most dangerous
economic crisis in our history'' because of hyperinflation, a huge
foreign debt and a stagnating economy.
   ``The government must root out the structural causes of
stagnation,'' he said. ``Individual initiative and competitiveness
within a market framework is the answer.''

of food, ingredients, descriptive terms used on labels and label
format.
   Each hearing will focus on a different aspect of labeling, but
comments on any or all of the specific issues will be accepted at
the hearings, the FDA said.
   The hearings will be held:
   _Oct. 16 in Chicago on nutrition information that should be
included on food labels.
   _Nov. 1 in Seattle on health messages on food labels.
   _Dec. 7 in San Antonio on ingredient labeling and food
descriptions.
   _Dec. 13 in Atlanta on formats for nutrition labeling.
   Consumers, food retailers and manufacturers, health care

<HEAD>Philadelphia Brokerage Suspended Over Penny Stock Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Philadelphia brokerage accused of
manipulating the price of a publicly traded stock has been fined
$50,000 and suspended from the National Association of Securities
Dealers.
   The NASD said Wednesday the action was part of a crackdown on
fraud and abusive sales practices in the penny-stock market.
   Bailey, Martin &amp; Appel Inc. was accused of violating the NASD's
anti-fraud provisions by artificially increasing the price of stock
for Northgate Industries Inc., a shell corporation with no assets.
   The brokerage neither admitted nor denied the allegations. It
settled the case by paying the fine and agreeing to the suspension.
   Two of the firm's owners, who also were suspended from the
association, denied any wrongdoing. They said they had agreed to
settle the case to prevent a long, costly legal fight.
   ``We feel they've made an enormous mountain out of a molehill,''
said Donald Bailey, chairman of BMA Group Ltd., the holding company
that owns Bailey Martin.
   Howard M. Appel, a co-owner of the firm, said the sales involved
only 30 clients and none had complained to the association, which
regulates over-the-counter stocks.
   The association's market-surveillance committee filed a
complaint in July stating that Bailey Martin had acquired 70
percent of Northgate's stock at 20 cents per share shortly before
it merged with Starcom Entertainment International Inc., a company
with no operating history or revenues.
   After the merger, the brokerage increased the price of the stock
to $3 per share _ an increase of 1,400 percent _ by purchasing and
selling shares at higher prices despite ``limited wholesale and
retail demand for the stock,'' the complaint said.
