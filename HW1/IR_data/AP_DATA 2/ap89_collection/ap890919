   Organizations formed after the 1985 earthquake
that killed more than 10,000 people marked the anniversary of the
disaster with anti-government demonstrations and memorial services
Tuesday.
   About 250 people from the Sept. 19 Seamstresses Union attended a
Mass and then briefly blocked busy San Antonio Abad Street, where
hundreds perished in garment factories that collapsed during the
quake. About 50 riot police forced the demonstrators back to the
sidewalk, allowing morning rush-hour traffic to resume.
   Several groups placed flowers at Solidarity Plaza where a hotel
burned in the quake. Residents of the Tlatelolco housing complex
attended a Mass at 7:19 a.m. _ the time the quake collapsed two of
the three sections of a 14-story apartment building.
   Organizations demanding housing for the homeless made a 20-block
march to the Zocalo, the capital's main plaza, where an estimated
12,000 people gathered for a rally.
   ``There are more than 2,000 homeless families still living in
temporary camps in the Cuahtemoc borough,'' Alejandro Varas, one of
the protest organizaers, said in an interview.
   He said there are about 1,500 housing units promised by the
government that haven't been turned over to the quake victims.
``There is open corruption in the delivery. We demand cleanliness in
the distribution of housing,'' Varas said.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari raised the flag to half-staff
in the Zocalo earlier Tuesday, observed a minute of silence and
dedicated a new government hospital that replaced a 12-story
building that fell.
   He said the new Juarez Hospital ``comes out of the tragedy of the
September 1985 earthquakes. It is, in essence, a memorial to those
who died, and at the same time, shows us that Mexicans can convert
adversity into regeneration and above all, permanently maintain the
solidarity in benefit of all our countrymen.''
   The destroyed hospital was one of two where 19 babies survived in
the rubble for from eight hours to nearly nine days before they were
rescued.
   Dehydrated and covered with infected wounds when they were found,
the ``miracle babies'' today are active 4-year-olds.
   The government said 6,000 people perished in the earthquake and
an aftershock the next day. Others have placed the death toll as
high as 32,000.
   More than 400 buildings in Mexico City, with a population of 18
million, were destroyed and 5,700 damaged, according to the
government.
   The Sept. 19 Seamstresses' Union and the organizations for the
homeless were among groups that were organized after the quake. Many
have developed into permanent activist groups.
   In July 1988, leftist political parties with the support of many
of the groups made their strongest showing in a Mexican presidential
election, holding Salinas to just over 50 percent of the vote.

<HEAD>Residents of Bahamas Brace for Hugo's Passage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) </DATELINE>

   Islanders boarded up their homes and
bought supplies Tuesday as Hurricane Hugo, blamed in at least 25
deaths, swept along the Bahamas after leaving an estimated 50,000
people homeless in the eastern Caribbean.
   Weather officials said the hurricane would begin affecting the
British colony of Turks and Caicos Islands southeast of the Bahamas
chain on Tuesday night. The storm was moving on a parallel course
east of the Bahamas.
   ``All of the islands at some time or another are going to get
some effects (from Hugo),'' said Noel Risnychok, specialist with the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   Weather officials in the Bahamas feared Hugo could drift westward
toward more populated islands, including New Providence.
   That island, which includes the Bahamas capital city of Nassau,
is the most populated with an estimated 135,000 people.
   The government of the Bahamas Tuesday downgraded the hurricane
watch for the central Bahamas to a tropical storm warning. A
tropical storm warning remained in effect for the southern Bahamas,
though it was discontinued for the Turks and Caicos Islands.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday, the hurricane's center was near
latitude 23.8 degrees north and longitude 69.5 west, about 190 miles
east northeast of Grand Turk Island in the southern Bahamas,
according to the National Weather Service.
   Hugo was moving in a northwesterly direction at about 12 miles
per hour with its highest sustained winds at 105 mph.
   Government officials in Nassau were monitoring the hurricane but
had not made any special preparations Tuesday for Hugo, said Bill
Kalis, press secretary for the government's information office.
   Residents were told to monitor weather advisories but could go
about their daily businesses, he said.
   ``They were telling everybody to get the water, the lamps
handy,'' said Dorothea Seymour of Naussau, who has a stall at The
Straw Market on Bay Street. ``We never had a storm here for some
years. We're always hearing about storms, but they never come.
   ``Some people worry, some people don't,'' she said.
   ``Although the indications are that it's going to move east of
the more populated areas, no one is relaxing their vigil because it
can change direction,'' Kalis said.
   Kalis said residents were gathering supplies in preparation.
   ``The stores have reported brisk sales of supplies such as
flashlight batteries and lumber for boarding up windows,'' he said.
   Weather officials in the Bahamas said Hugo's threat to the
northwestern Bahamas has intensified because of the
west-northwestern drift that the hurricane is expected to take.
   ``This westward drift can spell trouble for the northwestern
Bahamas which includes the bulk of the population,'' said Ken
Lightbourne, chief meteorological officer for the government's
weather agency in Nassau.
   Officials with Paradise Island Airlines in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
said they had not changed flight schedules yet, but were monitoring
the hurricane's path.
   ``We're just keeping a close eye on it like everybody else,''
said Hugh Riesdorph, director of flight operations for the airlines.
   He said the company makes 11 round-trip flights daily from Fort
Lauderdale and Miami to Paradise Island, which is linked by a bridge
to Nassau.

   Vice President Dan Quayle stopped in
Alaska on Monday and reassured officials that cleanup work is not
over on the oil-smeared beaches of Prince William Sound.
   ``The job is not complete,'' Quayle said during a brief refueling
stop en route to Korea, Japan and the Philippines. ``You have our
assurance that we will stay until the job is complete.''
   Quayle was referring to the Coast Guard's role as federal
coordinator in Valdez. Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost has been
monitoring Exxon's cleanup work since three weeks after the March 24
wreck of the tanker Exxon Valdez.
   The tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Prince
William Sound after slamming into a reef, resulting in the nation's
worst oil spill.
   Exxon declared its summer cleanup finished on Friday. The company
said dwindling sunlight and deteriorating weather made further work
this year unsafe.
   Quayle's visit came as President Bush visited the Northwest in a
swing through South Dakota, Montana and Washington. Bush defended
his decision not to travel to Alaska, saying he had sent his
``environmental vice president.''
   During his visit, Quayle spent about a half-hour with Alaska's
``oiled mayors'' _ the mayors of five coastal communities where
crude continues to wash up on shore and where fishing fleets
generally were tied up for the summer.
   Last May, Quayle inspected the oil spill cleanup on Smith Island.
Quayle said Monday it would not surprise him to learn that parts of
the island, among the first and hardest hit by the spill, remain
oily months after cleanup began.
   The Alaska mayors apparently won no new promises of action from
the administration.
   But Kodiak Mayor Robert B. Brodie said Quayle seemed to listen to
the mayors' concerns about the federal cleanup role next spring.
   ``We told him the spill's not over just because Exxon has
completed work and gone,'' Brodie said.
   The vice president also met briefly with driftnet fishermen, who
are concerned about the Bush administration's new agreement aimed at
restricting driftnet fleets from Taiwan, Korea and Japan from
fishing the North Pacific Ocean for squid.
   U.S. fishermen oppose the use of driftnets by foreign fleets
because they contend the lightweight nets illegally harvest
thousands of tons of salmon and steelhead.

<HEAD>SWAPO Taken To Court In Dispute Over Missing Detainees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Court proceedings were instituted
against the leader of the South-West Africa People's Organization by
a group seeking information about hundreds of people the guerrilla
movement allegedly detained.
   SWAPO President Sam Nujoma, who returned last week after 30 years
in exile, was served with court papers Monday by a deputy sheriff
following the legal move by the Parents Committee of Namibia.
   The committee alleged that SWAPO has failed to account for about
1,400 people who were put to work at guerrilla bases in Angola
during the movement's 23-year bush war against South African rule in
neighboring Namibia.
   South Africa has agreed to grant the territory independence, and
SWAPO is favored to win U.N.-supervised elections in November for an
assembly that will draft a constitution.
   SWAPO contends that it complied with the U.N. independence plan
by releasing all prisoners in its custody.
   But the Parents Committee, in documents filed with the
territorial Supreme Court, claimed 1,400 people either remain in
SWAPO prison camps or have disappeared. The committee called on
SWAPO to account for the whereabouts of the missing people.
   A U.N. delegation is due back in Namibia soon after a trip to
Angola and Zambia to determine whether any prisoners are at SWAPO
camps.
   According to freed detainees, hundreds of SWAPO members were
accused of being South African spies and many were tortured until
they signed confessions. SWAPO leaders have confirmed incidents of
torture, and have countered that the South African-led security
forces also were guilty of brutality.

<HEAD>Pay in Foreign Products Inspires Soviets to Work 10 Times Harder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Berry-pickers in the Soviet Far North gathered ten
times as many blueberries and cranberries this year after a
Swedish-Soviet firm offered to pay them with foreign fashions and
consumer electronics, Tass says.
   The Soviet news agency reported Mondya that cooperatives in the
Murmansk area gathered 100 tons of blueberries and 500 tons of
cowberries, a type of tundra cranberry, for a Swedish-Soviet joint
venture called Artikfryuz.
   That is ten times the amount they collected in their most
productive years.
   Soviet stores are nearly empty, particularly in provincial towns
like Murmansk. The few goods often are allocated by privilege, so
Soviet workers paid in rubles can find themselves with nothing to
buy.
   Soviet citizens are not allowed to hold foreign currency, and the
handful who work for foreign firms receive a fraction of their pay
in credit at hard currency stores.
   The Tass story was the first to indicate that foreign firms might
be able to pay Soviets directly with imported consumer goods.
   The Soviet government also has started an experiment that will
pay grain farmers in hard currency for producing extra wheat in
hopes of cutting the amount they now import at higher, world-market
prices.

<HEAD>Heiress Leaves Estate To Help Town Children Go to College</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVINCETOWN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An heiress who considered residents of
this resort town her family worried that the tourist wealth wasn't
reaching them. So when she died, she left an estate of $800,000 to
help each child go to college.
   When Celia Francis graduated from Provincetown High School in
1921, she was herself a recipient of a scholarship. Francis
reportedly was criticized for taking the money because her family
was wealthly and some say she left her fortune to ease the sting of
those remarks.
   Francis used the money to attend Boston University and went on to
become a government lawyer. She returned home in the 1950s to be
with her mother and brother, who were all that remained of her
immediate family.
   But soon after her arrival, both died suddenly within two months
of each other. Francis, who was unmarried, was left with a
substantial inheritance from her father's and brother's real estate
business _ much of it was made supplying housing to the artists and
writers who made up the first wave of tourists here.
   Alone, she took on the Provincetown community as her new family,
said Margaret Roberts, a close friend.
   ``She always kept her eye on what was happening in the town,''
said Roberts on Friday. ``She kept in contact with her friends
through an address book. She put down their names, and their
children's names, where they went to school _ and it was whole
family trees.''
   Provincetown, at the farthest end of Cape Cod from the mainland
and about a three hour's drive from Boston, is like many seaside
resorts: its population, normally around 4,000, swells to more than
10 times that in the summer. Tourist dollars provide a livelihood
for many residents, but it's largely seasonal work.
   ``Most (young residents) work in the summertime and collect
unemployment benefits in the winter,'' said Edward G. Boxer, the
high school's guidance counselor. ``There's not a lot of high-paying
jobs.''
   Francis often talked about how important education was for
expanding a person's options, Roberts said. In the end, Francis
stayed true to her adopted family. She died from cancer in 1983, but
her bequest established a fund of almost $800,000, enough to offer
financial aid of $500 to $5,000 for every college-bound student.
   Between 30 and 40 students graduate from Provincetown High each
year, and more than three-quarters go on to two- and four-year
colleges.
   Students say the money encourages them to think about wider
options.
   ``Whereas before maybe some kids ruled out college altogether,
maybe now they'll consider it,'' said one recent scholarship
recipient on Monday, William Rogers, who used his $5,000 award to
help pay tuition at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
   ``I just think more are thinking about going to college,'' said
Elmer Silva, who retired in 1985 as the high school's principal.
``And even if they go and only last a year, it's expanding their
horizons.''
   They are also thinking more about Francis, although she remains
something of an enigma even to those who knew her.
   Dr. Wilsa Ryder, who was Francis' neighbor for the last six years
of her life, suggests Francis was trying to repay the community for
the scholarship she accepted more than 60 years ago.
   ``I think that's why she bequeathed this huge amount, in order to
pay back that scholarship grant,'' said Ryder, who sits on the
committee charged with dispensing the fund.
   The scholarship program itself is not without controversy. The
scholarship committee has come under fire from residents for the way
it awards the money, and the amounts it doles out.
   In the four years that the scholarships have been awarded, less
than half of the available interest of about $80,000 a year has been
handed out. This year' applicants got a total of $30,000, and in an
irony that might have pained Francis, the committee rejected one
student on the basis that aid was not needed.
   The will stipulated those with need and academic ability get a
scholahship, but almost every applicant gets some money.
   Ryder said that management expenses and the need to add to the
principal to keep pace with inflation have cut into the available
funding.
   ``It always sounds like a terrible bundle, but the cost rises
each year,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager was arraigned under heavy
security Monday in connection with the Labor Day weekend stabbings
and beatings of a woman and her two daughters and the death of a
woman in 1987.
   Craig Price, 15, entered no plea to four counts of delinquency by
first-degree murder and two counts of burglary. Family Court Judge
Carmine DiPetrillo ordered Price held at the state Training School,
a juvenile prison ``for his protection and the protection of the
public.''
   The judge closed the second floor of the Kent County Courthouse
to all but reporters, lawyers and police because of ``certain death
threats that were made against the defendant.'' DiPetrillo and
Attorney General James E. O'Neil did not elaborate.
   Price, a former high school football player known as ``Iron Man''
who was repeating the ninth grade, said nothing during the hearing.
His mother, father and older brother attended the hearing but had no
comment.
   ``He gave a statement to the investigating detectives ... which
would very strongly implicate himself and no others in both
homicides,'' Blanchard said at a news conference after the
arraignment.
   About 30 people gathered outside the courthouse, including some
of Price's friends who claimed he could not have killed anyone.
   Price was arrested Sunday at his house, about a block from where
Joan Heaton, 39, and her daughters, Jennifer, 10, and Melissa, 8,
were found beaten and stabbed to death in their home Sept. 4.
   Stabbing victim Rebecca A. Spencer, 27, who died in July 1987,
lived two houses away from Price.
   ``He gave a statement to the investigating detectives ... which
would very strongly implicate himself and no others in both
homicides,'' police Chief Wesley Blanchard said at a news conference
after the arraignment.
   Some residents of the neighborhood said they had been wary of
letting their children play outside because of the killings, and gun
dealers and alarm companies reported increased business.
   DiPetrillo said Price was charged with three counts of deliquency
first-degree murder and one count of deliquency burglary in the
Heaton killings. He also was charged with one count each of
deliquency first-degree murder and burglary in Spencer's killing.
   O'Neil said that under the state's juvenile laws, Price, if found
delinquent, could be held at the Training School only until age 21.
The attorney general has been unsuccessfully trying to get the
General Assembly to pass legislation allowing juveniles under age 16
who face capital charges to be tried as adults.
   DiPetrillo set a probable cause hearing for Thursday at which the
state must outline its case against Price. Investigators have
declined to provide details so far.
   An autopsy revealed that Ms. Heaton and her daughters had bruises
and numerous broken bones, apparently from a struggle with their
killer, leading police to speculate the killer might have been cut
or injured.
   Scott Putnam, 18, who said he lived with the Prices until a few
days ago, said Price showed him a cut left index finger when Putnam
returned home early on Sept. 2.
   `You could see the bone on one side. It was deep,'' Putnam said.
Price said he had punched out a car window, he said.
   Richard Andrews, 18, said Price also showed him the cut, but
hours before police said they believed the Heatons were killed.
   Although Andrews described Price as a ``tough and vicious''
lineman on the football team, ``I just don't think he's capable of
it. He's not cold-hearted like that.''

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old girl has been charged with
setting a fire that killed four children at a foster home and
injured 12 other people.
   Lakeya Hartwell, whose half-brother was among the dead in the
Aug. 31 blaze, was arrested Sunday and ordered held without bail
pending a preliminary hearing Sept. 27.
   Lakeya, who also lived in the home, was not injured in the fire.
   She appeared in the arraignment room about 2:30 a.m. Monday
without an attorney or any family members present. When Bail
Commissioner Patrick Cubbage asked her if she understood the
charges, she nodded her head.
   She was charged with four counts of murder, 11 counts of
aggravated assault, 11 counts of simple assault, 11 counts of
recklessly endangering another person, one count of arson and one
count of risking and causing a catastrophe, police Lt. James Hansen
said.
   According to an unidentified police source quoted in Monday's
editions of The Philadelphia Inquirer, investigators believe Lakeya,
just hours before the blaze, told another occupant not to sleep at
the house because a fire was going to occur.
   Lakeya also had mentioned a blaze would occur in the house before
one of two previous fires, the source said.
   Police would not speculate on a motive.
   The fire started about 3 a.m. on Aug. 31 in the six-bedroom stone
and frame house where Hubert and Rose Artis had kept foster children
since 1972.
   Gasoline had been poured on an enclosed porch, the living room
and stairwell, investigators said.
   Killed were Lakeya's half-brother, Anwan G. Reid, 8, and three
other children. All were trapped in a second-floor bedroom. Eleven
residents of the house and a firefighter were injured.
   The Artises, both 65, were injured. Authorities described them as
``outstanding foster parents'' but added that too many children were
residing in the house.
   Lakeya had been placed in the home in 1986 by the city Department
of Human Services, police said.
   She and her half-brother had been taken from their mother, Wanda,
29, because of neglect, said the children's grandfather, Willie
Hartwell. Shortly after the fire, he said his daughter had a drug
problem and ``wouldn't take care of the kids.''

<HEAD>General Assembly Opens; Officials See New Era of Consensus</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Session not scheduled to begin until 3:30 p.m. EDT</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As the 44th General Assembly opens,
diplomats and officials are looking forward to a new era of
international cooperation after last year's session saw ``an end to
the Cold War.''
   In the last two years, the 159 nations have built upon the thaw
between the superpowers, addressing in earnest issues such as
peacekeeping, pollution and the world economy in a new, cooperative
spirit.
   ``There's a feeling that fundamental changes are happening...and
that now is not the time...to play up national differences,'' said
Ronald I. Spiers, the undersecretary for General Assembly Affairs.
``People want to work together and seek solutions to problems rather
than score debating points.''
   President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
approved that approach in speeches to the General Assembly last year.
   Those speeches, said Dante M. Caputo of Argentina, the departing
assembly president, ``are the deepest and most eloquent reflection
of profound change that has occurred.''
   ``They demonstrate, I would venture to say, the end of the Cold
War, which hovered over our world for such a long period,'' he said.
   On Monday, Caputo closed the yearlong 43rd session of the General
Assembly. Several unresolved issues were postponed for consideration
by the 44th session, which was to begin today. The most dramatic was
the Palestinian question and Israel's crackdown on the 21-month-old
uprising in the occupied territories that has left at least 572
Palestinians and 40 Israelis dead.
   That issue also provoked the biggest controversy of last year's
assembly, when the State Department refused to allow PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat to enter the United States to address the assembly.
Washington denied him a visa on the grounds that Arafat supported
terrorism against Israel.
   The General Assembly took the unprecedented protest step of
moving to Geneva for five days in December to hear the Palestine
Liberation Organization chief.
   At the Geneva meeting, Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist, eliminating the two key issues on which the
State Department had refused his visa request.
   Arafat has said he wants to address this year's General Assembly.
The State Department has said it has not yet received a visa request
and will not comment on whether it would be granted.
   Spiers, the top-ranking American in the world body and a former
State Department undersecretary, told reporters that Arafat should
be allowed to speak if he wishes.
   Arab League Ambassador Clovis Maksoud said he was confident the
Bush administration would grant a visa if one was requested.
   If the visa is not granted, said Maksoud, ``of course we would
want to go back to Geneva.'' The Arab League has more than enough
allies in the assembly to change its venue.
   Among speakers scheduled to present their governments' views are
President Bush, who is to address the assembly Monday, and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, set to speak the following day.
   President Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia on Sept. 29 will have
a chance to speak about his nation's battle against the cocaine
cartels.
   Other heads of state scheduled to speak include the presidents of
Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, Peru, Paraguay, Bolivia, El Salvador,
Costa Rica, Guatemala, Yugoslavia, Egypt, Cyprus, Zaire and Lesotho.
   The assembly was to choose a new president today.
   Under a system of rotating regional representation, the African
nations nominated the assembly leader this year. They selected
Nigeria's U.N. ambassador, Maj. Gen. Joseph Garba, a crusader
against apartheid, South Africa's legal system of racial segregation.
   The main portion of the General Assembly's work ends in
mid-December, but it will then hold a five-day special session on
apartheid.

   A city councilman bidding to become the city's
first black mayor was considered the frontrunner in Tuesday's
mayoral primary, in which 13 candidates are vying to succeed
outgoing Mayor Charles Royer.
   Polls showed City Councilman Norm Rice leading the clutch of five
political insiders who rose to the top the field. Rice, who lost to
Royer four years ago, was a last-minute entry, but quickly emerged
the favorite.
   His likely opponent in November will be either the city attorney
or a former King County executive.
   The two top finishers in the non-partisan election advance to the
November election. Among other Washington cities, mayoral primaries
will be held in Spokane and Tacoma.
   Royer is not seeking a fourth term and has accepted a top post at
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
   Rice, 46, is a former broadcast reporter, Urban League official
and a banker. He said he jumped into the fray because of what he
called a divisive anti-school busing initiative. The measure will be
on the November ballot.
   Another top candidate, City Attorney Doug Jewett, is co-sponsor
of the initiative, and backers say he can ride it into the mayor's
office.
   A co-favorite for the second runoff spot is Randy Revelle, a
Seattle attorney who headed King County government for four years
after a stint on the Seattle City Council.

   First lady Barbara Bush dedicated the first
school named after her husband, then met ``George Bush,'' the guinea
pig and ``Dan Quayle,'' the hermit crab, in kindergarten.
   It was Mrs. Bush's first visit since the election to the city
where she and the president spent 11 years in the 1950s and 1960s.
   Mrs. Bush was in Midland on Monday to dedicate George H.W. Bush
Elementary School.
   After a brief ceremony, she visited the 36 children in the
school's two kindergarten classes.
   ``What's his name?'' Mrs. Bush asked one of the kindergarten
students as she pointed at a brown and white guinea pig in a glass
tank. A little boy told her the name.
   ``Oh!'' she said, raising her eyebrows in feigned shock. ``George
Bush!''
   Then she walked over to another tank containing a hermit crab and
said, ``I'm not going to ask who the crab's named after.''
   She was told that the crab's name was ``Dan Quayle.''

children _ and she pointed to herself as an example.
   ``You can have a great marriage and great children; great
marriage and great career; great career and great children. But I
think it is so hard to have a great marriage, a great career, not a
job but a career, and great children,'' Ms. Walters told the
``Virginia Woman '90s'' conference sponsored by Sen. John W. Warner,
R-Va.
   She advised the 2,100 women in the audience Monday not to feel
guilty if they have trouble meeting the demands of career and
family, and admitted it hasn't been so easy for her.
   ``I've been divorced. I have a daughter, who, thank God, is 21
and out of her adolescence,'' said the 57-year-old ABC correspondent
and star of the ``20-20'' show.
   Ms. Walters advised the women to have a life beyond getting up in

   Dave Dravecky, the baseball pitcher who came
back from cancer in his throwing arm, has won the 1989 Willie Mac
Award as the San Francisco Giants' most inspirational player.
   The award, voted by the Giants' players, was announced Monday.
   Dravecky, 34, underwent surgery in October to remove a cancerous
tumor located in a muscle near his left shoulder. After months of
therapy and a minor league rehabilitation stint, he returned to the
mound Aug. 10 at Candlestick Park and pitched eight innings to earn
a 4-3 victory over Cincinnati.
   Five days later in Montreal, Dravecky broke a bone in his upper
left arm while making a pitch to the Expos' Tim Raines. He got the
victory to finish the year with a 2-0 record and a 3.46 earned run
average.
   Dravecky, the 10th winner of the award named for Giants Hall of
Famer Willie McCovey, will receive this year's plaque from McCovey
on Sunday. The award recognizes inspiration, courage, leadership,
character and dedication in the tradition of McCovey.

   Ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, who recently leaped
into the musical theater with ``The King and I,'' said he has no
qualms about taking over a role dominated for years by one actor _
the late Yul Brynner.
   ``I've never been intimidated by anything,'' Nureyev told
reporters Monday.
   ``I danced `Giselle.' Nijinsky danced `Giselle,''' he said,
referring to the late Russian dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, considered one
of the best dancers of all time.
   Nureyev, 51, plays the role of the king of Siam in the revival of
the Rodgers and Hammerstein hit, with British actress Liz Robertson
playing his Anna.
   Ottawa is the second stop of a tour that began in Toronto last
month.
   Nureyev, who has been artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet
since 1983, said he's enjoying the musical, in which he sings a
couple of songs and must pretend he doesn't know how to polka for
the famous ``Shall We Dance'' number.
   ``I enjoy it very much, yes, I do. It's not as hard as dancing.''

   A former employee armed with a revolver and five

Hospital, where he intended to stage a massacre, police said.
   Connell Hardy, 31, was angry about his forced resignation last
year as emergency room clerk, police said.
   ``We learned from him that he intended to go in and kill
everybody in the hospital,'' said police Lt. Patrick Logan.
   Hardy was armed with a .357-caliber Magnum, more than 40 rounds
of ammunition, and five bottles of alcohol rigged so they could be
lit and thrown, authorities said.
   Police said Hardy walked into the American Bar Association
offices on Monday after mistaking it for the hospital's offices. He
was given directions at the ABA but was stopped by police before
reaching the hospital.
   Hardy was being held in a lockup while investigators determined
the specific charges, police said.

   ``Sea of Love,'' ``Uncle Buck'' and
``Parenthood'' gave Universal Studios a sweep of the top three spots
at the nation's box offices last weekend.
   The last time a studio did that was in January 1987, when
Paramount grabbed the top spots with ``Critical Condition,'' ``Star
Trek IV'' and ``The Golden Child.''
   The fall movie season is off to a strong start, with the top 16
titles collecting $37.2 million, $10 million more than the top 18
movies a year ago.
   Led by the Al Pacino-Ellen Barkin romantic thriller ``Sea of
Love,'' with a record fall opening of $10 million, Universal's films
accounted for nearly 50 percent of the over-all domestic theater
gate, the studio said. Universal has held the No. 1 box-office spot
for seven-straight weeks.
   Finishing in second last weekend with $4.1 million in ticket
sales was ``Uncle Buck,'' a comedy starring John Candy as a
maladroit babysitter. In third was the family comedy ``Parenthood,''
with Steve Martin and Jason Robards, on grosses of $3.7 million.
   ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' the story of best friends who become
lovers, landed in fourth with $2.7 million. In fifth was the
martial-arts adventure ``Kickboxer,'' which netted $2.6 million.
   The action sequel ``Lethal Weapon 2'' was next, with $2.206
million. In seventh, with $2.15 million, was the underwater suspense
tale ``The Abyss.''
   Rounding out the top 10 were ``sex, lies and videotape'' with
$1.75 million, ``Turner and Hooch'' on $1.66 million, and ``Batman''
with $1.5 million.
   ``Batman'' has now grossed more than $243 million, passing
``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' to become the fifth biggest smash in
Hollywood history.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co.:
   1. ``Sea of Love,'' Universal, $10 million weekend gross, 1,246
screens, $8,040 per screen, $10 million total gross, one week in
release.
   2. ``Uncle Buck,'' Universal, $4.1 million, 1,817 screens, $2,270
per screen, $45.88 million, five weeks.
   3. ``Parenthood,'' Universal, $3.7 million, 1,392 screens, $2,680
per screen, $74.5 million, seven weeks.
   4. ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' Columbia, $2.65 million, 1,171
screens, $2,680 per screen, $75.3 million, 10 weeks.
   5. ``Kickboxer,'' Cannon, $2.6 million, 973 screens, $2,677 per
screen, $7.9 million, two weeks.
   6. ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' Warner Bros., $2.206 million, 1,393
screens, $1,583 per screen, $137.9 million, 11 weeks.
   7. ``The Abyss,'' 20th Century Fox, $2.15 million, 1,361 screens,
$1,580 per screen, $47.6 million, six weeks.

   Norbert Baker, who keeps his Cessna 150 in a
pasture, says he will add one more item to his preflight inspection.
   ``I'm definitely adding `snake' to my checklist,'' said the
Sturgis pilot, who came face-to-face with a 1{-foot-long bull snake
while cruising comfortably at 800 feet Friday night.
   Baker and Dale Rovere of Black Hawk were about 10 miles north of
Sturgis, a western South Dakota community, when the snake popped its
head up through a hole in the dashboard, about 2 feet in front of
their faces.
   ``He was hissing and sticking his tongue out at us,'' Rovere said.
   Baker reached for a rag, grabbed the snake and threw it out the
window. ``Stuff just flew everywhere. It was a mess,'' Rovere said.
   ``After it was over, we got quite a chuckle out of it,'' said
Baker. He figures the snake crawled up the tail assembly, through
the fuselage and into the engine compartment.
   The bull snake is nonpoisonous and feeds mostly on rodents.

   For Joan Koravos and Larry Guzzetta,
Interstate 5 is their freeway of love.
   The two said ``I do'' Sunday while parked in a stretch limousine
on the freeway.
   It was an appropriate spot: The couple first met on the
interstate three years ago.
   ``I was driving along, heading south on I-5, and I could just
feel this car tailing me,'' said Ms. Koravos. ``So I pulled into the
other lane and looked over to give this person a dirty look.''
   Instead, she found herself grinning at a winking Guzzetta. He
motioned to her to pull off. She did, and they went out for a drink.
   They discovered that a mutual business acquaintance had suggested
two days before that the two get together to discuss the direct mail
business, which Ms. Koravos was in at the time and Guzzetta was
considering entering.
   ``I tell my friends to forget the single bars,'' said Ms.
Koravos. ``If you're looking for the right person, just drive on the
freeways ... and smile.''
   Guzzetta, who eventually bought a direct-mail firm, also took an
unusual approach in his marriage proposal. He sent her a package of
direct-mail ads, including one that asked, ``Dear Joan, will you
please marry me? Larry.''
   Ms. Koravos answered by calling a Newport Beach restaurant that
night and asking the maitre d' to write on the portable menu board,
along with the specials, ``Yes, Larry, I will.''

   Don Cruse is happy he doesn't have to
take the Scholastic Aptitude Test again. After all, there's no way
to improve on his perfect 1,600 score.
   ``I can concentrate on some other things now,'' he said.
   Cruse was one of only 14 students in the nation who achieved a
perfect score on the SAT during the 1988-89 school year. About 1.8
million took the multiple-choice test, and the national average
score of verbal and mathematical reasoning was 903.
   Most students wait until their senior year to take the college
entrance exam. Cruse did it as a sophomore.
   ``There really is no secret,'' said Cruse, now a 16-year-old
junior at Martin High School. ``The test includes material that's
covered in class. And I have to study just like other students.''
   Cruse's class schedule this semester includes Latin II,
pre-calculus, physics, English, history and biology. All but Latin
II are advanced classes.
   He said he was thinking about going to Harvard University as a
prelaw major.

<HEAD>Bootmaker Appeals to Professional Cowboys, Yuppies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man who spent 20 years on the rodeo
circuit now makes his living making boots and other items that fit
the special needs of professional cowboys.
   And a few yuppies who would like to look like professional
cowboys.
   Veldon Morgan, his wife and two sons, run the Old Spade Western
Store that greets visitors to this community of about two-dozen
people in the heart of the Nebraska Panhandle.
   Handmade Morgan boots, which line the walls of the rustic store
built in 1869, run from $119 to $750, excluding custom orders.
   The newest boot, a lace-up roper, was the brainchild of the
54-year-old Morgan and a professional rodeo friend and customer.
   ``Regular cowboy boots have a somewhat flimsy shaft,'' explained
Wayne Morgan, Veldon's son and general manager. ``Professional
ropers complain that when they step, jump or fly off a horse it's
easy to twist an ankle in conventional boots.''
   A U-shaped toe and a block heel make the new lace-up boots
working boots bound to be a hit with cowboys.
   ``The professional rodeo cowboy is a honed athlete, but they've
always had to dress like a ranch cowboy,'' the elder Morgan said
Monday.
   ``To send them into the rodeo arena dressed like a ranch cowboy
is like sending a boxer into the ring wearing cowboy boots,'' said
Morgan, who was on the professional rodeo circuit for 20 years.
``The guy with the boxing shoes would beat the other guy every
time.''
   The company also has found a new market: ``one we'd never expect,
among yuppies on the coasts,'' his son said.
   ``The idea of a lace-up cowboy boot must just appeal to them.''
   So, apparently, does the gear used to carry coiled ropes and
boots and saddles, he said.
   ``We've expanded the nylon luggage line into a whole area of
backpacking, horsepacking and camping equipment as well,'' Wayne
Morgan said.
   More than 40 people work in the large manufacturing plant and
warehouses attached to the store.
   The complex has been expanded twice as the business has grown,
Wayne Morgan said. Last spring, the company bought the Laramie Boot
Co. and some manufacturing is done in El Paso, Texas.
   Handmade saddles ranging from $895 to $2,000 have become another
staple of the business. It takes 15 hours to assemble a plain
saddle's 25 to 30 parts, Wayne Morgan said.
   Craftsmen work at individual booths in the factory, concentrating
on one saddle at a time.
   ``We've tried to make things that are needed,'' Vernon Morgan
said. ``Somebody made lace-up boots back in the '30s and then quit.
We decided to pick it up again. It's a new frontier out there.''

   Long-term studies with AZT show the AIDS drug can
reverse many symptoms of the disease in children while avoiding side
effects, researchers say.
   The drug previously has been shown to extend the lives of adults
with AIDS and to delay the development of symptoms in those who are
infected but not yet sick.
   A year ago, National Cancer Institute scientists reported it
could prevent brain abnormalities in children, but concerns about
its side effects remained.
   The most extensive study of AZT in children now shows it is safe,
helps children gain weight and avoid life-threatening infections,
and improves their well-being, says Ross McKinney of Duke University
in North Carolina.
   The study, part of a National Institutes of Health project to
assess AZT in children, was reported Monday at a meeting of the
American Society for Microbiology.
   At the same time, AZT's maker, Burroughs Wellcome Co. of Research
Triangle Park, N.C., announced it was cutting the wholesale price of
the drug by 20 percent, from $1.50 to $1.20 per capsule. A year's
supply has been costing patients $7,000 to $8,000.
   In other studies reported here, National Cancer Institute
researchers said they had obtained promising initial results with
two newer AIDS drugs, called ddI and ddC.
   The drugs helped restore some brain function to a few children
out of several dozen tested, without causing dangerous side effects,
said Dr. Philip Pizzo, the institute's chief of pediatrics.
   A 32-month-old boy who had lost the ability to stand and walk and
was losing his speech _ all because of an AIDS infection in the
brain _ stood, began walking with help and began to speak more
clearly after being given ddI, said Dr. Karina Butler of the cancer
institute.
   About one-third of the children given ddI and ddC showed signs
that their AIDS-damaged immune systems were at least partially
restored.
   Furthermore, both the new drugs seem to work well in combination
with AZT, said Pizzo.
   ``That seems to us to be an area worthy of study,'' he said.
``We're on the lookout for agents that can be put into combination
regimens.''
   The combination may, as is the case with cancer drugs, reduce
side effects while increasing efficacy, Pizzo explained. One child
in the study, for example, could not tolerate regular doses of AZT
without serious side effects but is now doing well on an alternating
combination of AZT and ddC.
   Twelve of 35 children required blood transfusions to counteract
anemia caused by AZT's toxic effects on their bone marrow, McKinney
said. Some also showed low white blood cell counts. But those side
effects were considered manageable.
   Only five of the patients developed the so-called opportunistic
infections that often kill AIDS patients.
   The children ranged from 5 months to 13 years old. Ten were
younger than age 2. ``It's looking more and more that that's who's
going to be getting it among kids,'' McKinney said.
   Giving it to children early may delay the development of serious
brain disorders, which occur in about 80 percent of children with
AIDS, McKinney said.
   Determining when to give AZT to children will be difficult,
however, because studies have shown that AIDS can be quite different
in children and adults, McKinney said.
   ``It may be that children need to start earlier and get higher
doses,'' he said.
   For example, AIDS doesn't usually appear in adults until their
T4-cell count, a measure of the immune system's health, drops below
500. Adults with a T4-cell count above 500 are usually healthy.
   ``That's not a valid number for children,'' said McKinney. ``All
of us have lost kids who have had T4 counts above 1,000.''

<HEAD>Arizona Senators Face Martin Luther King Day Bill Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of a holiday to honor assassinated civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. are hoping the prospect of a
Super Bowl can succeed where convention boycotts and bad publicity
failed.
   ``Without a holiday, there is little chance in Arizona for a
Super Bowl,'' House Minority Leader Art Hamilton, a Democrat who
leads the pro-holiday forces, said Monday.
   Bill Shover, a newspaper executive who heads the booster group
Phoenix 93, agreed.
   ``We feel sure if we don't have a King holiday we won't be on a
level playing field for the '93 Super Bowl,'' said Shover, director
of community and corporate services for Phoenix Newspapers Inc.,
publishers of The Arizona Republic and The Phoenix Gazette.
   The issue comes up as part of a special session that begins
Wednesday on prison crowding, drugs and economic development, and
both sides are squirming already.
   ``If we fail again, the frustration level ... will rise,''
Hamilton said.
   But Senate President Bob Usdane, a Republican who wants the issue
referred to a general election ballot, said the bill is not
appropriate for a special session.
   ``With a special session, you want to get out quickly,'' Usdane
said. ``You don't need controversy in a special session.''
   The Republican-controlled House has voted for a King holiday in
the past, but conservative Senate Republicans have defeated the
proposal.
   The fight has been going on for years.
   Democratic Gov. Bruce Babbitt, then about to launch a
presidential campaign and frustrated by lack of progress on the King
issue, signed an executive proclamation in 1986 giving state
employees the day off.
   Republican state Attorney General Bob Corbin declared that
Babbitt lacked authority to issue such an order, however. Babbitt's
successor, Republican Evan Mecham, rescinded the proclamation before
it could take effect.
   Mecham also said he did not believe that King deserved a holiday,
and civil rights groups launched a boycott of the state as a
convention site.
   Mecham's impeachment in April 1988 on unrelated charges brought
Secretary of State Rose Mofford to power as governor. Mrs. Mofford,
a Democrat, has pledged to do whatever is necessary for a King
holiday.
   But while Mrs. Mofford has lobbied quietly for the bill since
then, most Senate Republicans have held fast against it.
   A recent study estimates the state has lost $256 million in
convention and tourist business since Mecham's order, and some Super
Bowl boosters say Phoenix's bid for the 1993 game is doomed if
there's no holiday.
   But some Senate Republicans say the holiday is a slap in the face
to Abraham Lincoln because it would follow the federal practice of
combining holidays for Lincoln and George Washington into a single
holiday in exchange for a state holiday honoring King.
   Some GOP senators have offered to vote for a bill that would
trade in Columbus Day for King Day. But Mrs. Mofford said she
rejects that option, and Democratic lawmakers say they would prefer
to avoid it, even though they consider it a possibility.
   Religious leaders and business executives have been urging
approval of the King holiday for years, but Republican lawmakers say
their constituents don't agree.
   Furthermore, they note, many of the businesses that are pushing
for the holiday don't even give their own employees the day off.
   ``They ought to take a look in the mirror,'' said Sen. Doug Todd,
a Republican who is among those targeted by the executives.

<HEAD>10-Hour Videocassette Tapes on the Way</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tired of all those videocassettes cluttering up
your house? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to tape 10 favorite TV
soaps or five or six movies on one cassette?
   How about 30 hours of recording per cassette?
   West German videocassette manufacturer BASF says that by 1991 it
will be offering U.S. viewers a tape with a 10-hour capacity.
   Meanwhile, a Finnish company, Nokia, says it has developed a new
technology allowing a new line of VHS recorders to cram those 10
hours onto a tape without the loss of picture quality that results
when today's VCRs are cranked down to their slowest speeds.
   ``The picture quality is better than existing long-play
systems,'' Nokia spokesman Lauri Kivinen said in a telephone
interview last week.
   Nokia, a major manufacturer of television sets in Europe, hopes
to license its new technology to VCR manufacturers and the new
recorders could be on the market sometime in 1990, Kivinen said.
   The BASF tape will be usable on existing videocassette recorders.
BASF will use a superstrong, thin polyester film to pile more tape
into each videocassette, according to the Sept. 11 issue of TV
Digest, which reviewed the new Nokia and BASF products at the Berlin
Audio-Visual Fair.
   The BASF cassette will allow up to 15 hours of taping on VCRs
with a European system that uses a slower speed than U.S.
videocassette recorders.
   U.S. VCRs provide two hours of recording at normal speed on a
standard cassette. American VCRs also have a half-speed, long-play
mode that allows four hours of recording, and a one-third,
extended-play speed that allows six hours of recording.
   The higher the taping speed, the better the image quality.
   Nokia says it has found a way to record at a speed equivalent to
the extended-play mode while maintaining image quality that is
better than long-play mode.
   Kivinen said Nokia hopes its system will become the new standard
for VCRs. TV Digest quoted the system's inventor, Nokia engineer
Gerd Reime, as saying that although no tests have been conducted, 30
hours of taping may be possible using his new technology.
   Reime said the new circuitry could cost as little as $3 to
incorporate into new VCRs.
   BASF has been testing its new super long-play tape for about a
year and will introduce it in Europe this fall, according to Tom
Neidhart, director of marketing at BASF's information systems
division in Bedford, Mass.
   ``By 1991 we expect to offer the 10-hour tape in the U.S.,''
Neidhart said.
   BASF already markets a videocassette in the United States that
allows eight hours of taping at slow speed. But the tape has
captured only a small percentage of the blank videocassette market,
which is approaching 300 million units in annual sales, Neidhart
said.
   BASF launched a national television ad campaign last month to try
to boost sales for the eight-hour tape.
   ``We know from research that most people would like to use a
longer tape for some or all of their recording purposes,'' Neidhart
said, noting that it means viewers won't run out of tape too soon
and that the tapes will take up less space in their video libraries.

<HEAD>US Moves Toward Closer Economic Ties With Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration plans to boost
Hungary's trade status following a series of steps viewed by U.S.
officials as progress on economic and political issues by the Warsaw
Pact nation.
   ``Hungary has undertaken major steps toward economic and
political reform,'' leading to the U.S. plan to grant most-favored
nation status to the Eastern European communist state, President
Bush said on Monday.
   Speaking at a news conference in Helena, Mont., Bush said the
move ``will open new doors for the Hungarian economy, encouraging
greater market orientation and increasing the foreign exchange
earnings.''
   That and other initiatives were announced Monday by Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who was in Budapest for talks with
Hungarian officials.
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post today quoted Hungary's new
parliament speaker, Matyas Szuros, as saying he sees the possibility
that his nation could withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and become
neutral by the end of the century.
   Szuros said the shift to neutrality could take place ``within a
climate of trust'' between Hungary and the Soviet Union.
   The package announced by Mosbacher also includes new development
programs and the establishment of a $25 million fund to help create
private business in Hungary.
   The proposals are part of a comprehensive pact to ``support
Hungary's efforts to develop a freer political system and to create
and expand private enterprise,'' said Mosbacher.
   The White House released Bush's letter to Congress in which he
said ``it is my intent to add Hungary to the list'' of countries
that qualify for most-favored nation status, which would guarantee
Hungary the lowest tariffs for its products that any competing
country gets.
   Hungary recently defied authorities in East Berlin by allowing
thousands of East German citizens to use Hungary as a conduit to
emigrate to West Germany. In May, Hungary tore down the barbed wire
fence that had sharply restricted travel by Hungarians to the West.
   According to his spokeswoman, the only foreign gift that
Secretary of State James A. Baker III keeps in his office is a piece
of the fence which Hungarian officials gave him during his visit to
Hungary in July.
   The administration also attaches significance, officials said, to
the withdrawal of some Soviet troops from Hungary in recent months,
part of a commitment by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to reduce
overall troop levels in Eastern Europe.
   Monday's announcement came four days after Bush's decision to
double food aid to Poland _ another Warsaw Pact member _ to $100
million in the next fiscal year.
   Many in Congress had criticized Bush for not doing more for
Poland following the accession of a non-communist premier in Warsaw.
There has been less pressure for an increase in U.S. cooperation
with Hungary because Poland's economic situation is far bleaker than
Hungary's.
   Mosbacher said the $25 million to help develop private business
in Hungary ``is an important part of implementing President Bush's
goal of building an American partnership with Hungary.''
   He said Hungary will be granted permanent most-favored trade
status in October if its parliament, as expected, enacts legislation
on freedom of emigration by the end of September.
   Mosbacher also said Bush is notifying Congress of his intention
to designate Hungary as eligible for Generalized System of
Preferences treatment, which would offer Hungarian exporters
duty-free tariff treatment for a broad range of exports to the
United States worth more than $110 million.
   Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
complained Monday that the Bush administration hasn't moved quickly
enough to support East European communist nations _ such as Hungary
_ that are moving toward democratic change.
   ``The administration's timidity in the face of these
opportunities is puzzling and dismaying,'' Mitchell told the Senate.
``Instead of encouragement and engagement, the administration has
adopted an almost passive stance.''

   The American who sponsored Boris N. Yeltsin's
tour of America strongly denies accusations published by a Soviet
newspaper that the Communist Party maverick was publicly drunk for
much of the trip.
   ``If there was any problem with Yeltsin, it was jet lag,'' said
Jim Garrison, executive director of the Esalen Institute
Soviet-American Exchange Program, which sponsored the nine-day,
11-city tour. ``Most of the time he was cold sober.''
   Pravda, organ of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, on
Monday reprinted an article from the Italian newspaper La Republica
saying Yeltsin was repeatedly drunk during the tour and squandered
his lecture fees shopping.
   Yeltsin ``leaves behind him a wake of catastrophic prophecies,
insane expenses, interviews, and above all the perfume of Jack
Daniels Black label,'' said the article, translated into Russian.
   Pravda did not comment on the article, but advertised it in a
front-page box that said Yeltsin found the United States ``a
holiday, a stage, a bar 5,000 kilometers long.''
   Yeltsin, interviewed as he arrived back in Moscow from the trip,
called the report ``garbage.''
   ``It's a simple lie, slander and revenge for the fact that
Americans received us with admiration,'' he said, flushing with
anger.
   The Pravda article clearly reflected Kremlin anger at Yeltsin's
criticism of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top
leaders. While in the United States, Yeltsin said Gorbachev had made
mistakes and faced a potential revolution from Soviet citizens
dissatisfied with the pace of reform.
   Yeltsin was dumped from his job as Moscow party chief and his
post on the ruling Politburo for making similar comments in late
1987. But Moscow voters overwhelmingly elected him to the newly
constituted Congress of Peoples' Deputies last March.
   Before leaving America, Yeltsin ``predicted the knives would be
out on his return,'' said Garrison, who accompanied him throughout
the tour.
   ``What Pravda has done is for political motivations,'' said
Garrison.
   Asked to comment on reports that Yeltsin drank a bottle and a
half of whiskey the night before he spoke in Baltimore last Tuesday,
Garrison said:
   ``He certainly did not finish off a bottle and a half of Jack
Daniels. The entire delegation of five Soviets drank a bottle. But
for five Soviet men to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels, that's
normal. That's the culture. Soviets tend to drink a lot.''
   Yeltsin suffered from jet lag and a hectic schedule, and by the
time he spoke in Baltimore, said Garrison, ``he had not slept for
three nights.''
   Garrison said he personally called off a scheduled appearance by
Yeltsin on the ABC-TV program ``Nightline,'' to be taped last
Monday, the afternoon before the Baltimore speech.
   ``I canceled it because he was jet-lagged. He was just
dropping,'' Garrison said in an interview in Washington.
   On the day the appearance was canceled, Yeltsin had no alcohol,
said Garrison.
   Garrison also denied that Yeltsin had blown his lecture fees on a
shopping spree. On Sunday night, Garrison said, he and Yeltsin
signed an agreement to use the proceeds of the lecture tour ``toward
eradicating AIDs in the Soviet Union.''
   Esalen, based in San Francisco, is a non-profit institution that
deals in exchange programs with the Soviet Union.
   The fund will ship ``$100,000 worth of medical equipment to the
Soviet Union, primarily in the form of disposable syringes,'' said
Garrison.
   ``All the bills are not in yet, but he is going to earn roughly
$20,000 to $40,000'' from the lecture tour, said Garrison. ``The
gross was close to $160,000 to $170,000.'' The speakers' bureau will
take 30 percent, and much of the balance will pay the costs of the
nine-person entourage.
   Yeltsin ``will accept none of the proceeds. All of the proceeds
will go to buy medical equipment,'' said Garrison.
   The AIDs program will be run by Yeltsin's parliamentary office in
the Moskva Hotel off Red Square and by the Foundation for Social
Innovation, which has offices in San Francisco and Moscow.
   ``We gave him $100 a day as a per diem. So he had $900 of
personal money. That is all he had,'' said Garrison. ``He sent his
aide out to buy a few things, basically children's clothes, Levis
and toys for his grandchildren.'' Additionally, Esalen gave Yeltsin
a personal computer for his parliamentary office, he said.

   Stampeded. Plucked. Left in the Dust. The angry
headlines in Texas newspapers said it all.
   The CBS miniseries, ``Lonesome Dove,'' a saga of western frontier
life, got barely a nod from the television industry in Sunday
night's Emmy awards and Texans weren't happy about it.
   ``It's something that you can't help feeling bitter or upset
about,'' said Helen Human, the Dallas actress who portrayed the
bossy and buxom ``Peach.''
   The epic depicted a cattle drive from dusty Lonesome Dove, Texas,
to Montana. It's central characters were two aging Texas Rangers
portrayed by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones.
   Although ``Lonesome Dove'' gathered a leading seven trophies
including Saturday's technical ceremony, the adaptation of Larry
McMurtry's acclaimed novel won only one key category Sunday, for
director Simon Wincer. It received 18 nominations, more than any
show.
   ``I just wish the people who were more vitally involved with it
got the recognition they needed to get,'' said Ms. Human. ``It kind
of gives me the impression that somebody woke up with a sore tooth
when they voted _ that's how ridiculous it is.''
   Sore heads might have been involved, too, Ms. Human said.
   ``Mr. Duval is a very talented person, but he's also a very
strong person and a lot of times, Hollywood doesn't like that. ...
But, there's no way you're going to know for sure.''
   A television critic at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the
decision ``an unbelievable lapse in judgment.''
   The Television Academy of Arts and Sciences ``embarrassed itself
by refusing to honor `Lonesome Dove' as the season's finest
miniseries,'' Art Chapman wrote.
   The winner of that category was the monumental ABC saga ``War and
Remembrance.''
   Many industry watchers thought Duvall had a virtual lock on a
best actor Emmy for his portrayal of the talkative Texas Ranger Gus.
The award went instead to James Woods, who played the co-founder of
Alcoholics Anonymous in the CBS movie ``My Name is Bill W.''
   Even Dan Curtis, the executive producer of ``War and
Remembrance,'' called his victory ``a major shock.''

<HEAD>Cheney: No Reason to Question Iowa Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says he's
satisfied Navy officials investigating the explosion that killed 47
sailors on the USS Iowa did ``the best job they could.''
   Cheney told reporters Monday he had no reason to question the
finding that gunners mate Clayton Hartwig apparently caused the
blast by inserting a detonating device between bags of gunpowder in
the ship's ill-fated No.2 gun turret.
   ``I do think it's important to point out that the information or
the evidence that's available is incomplete,'' Cheney said in his
first extensive public statement about the report.
   ``We'll never know with absolute certainty exactly what
transpired because of the nature of the incident itself,'' he said.
   In the report issued earlier this month, the Navy said the blast
apparently was caused by a detonating device between bags of
gunpowder and that the Hartwig, the gun captain at the time, was the
most likely person to have sabotaged the firing. The report said
uncertainty remains, however, because all the witnesses died in the
explosion.
   Navy officials also said they had ruled out technical reason for
the blast after conducting some 20,000 tests on the gunpowder and
guns used aboard the ship.
   ``I think the Navy did the best job they could under the
circumstances on the Iowa. I think the investigation ... was a good
one,'' Cheney said.
   Cheney said the service did ``a good technical job of checking
out all conceivable possibilities by which that incident might have
occurred, such as an accident because of the gunpowder exploding
prematurely or some other such thing.''
   ``I am satisfied with that aspect of it,'' he said.
   Hartwig's family has criticized the report for singling him out,
but Cheney said Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, the investigating
officer, was required to provide his best conclusion on what
happened.
   ``That's what he's done,'' Cheney said. ``I don't have any reason
to question it.''
   Media General Newspapers reported Sunday that experiments were
being conducted on the Iowa using an improper number of powder bags
combined with the heaviest-weight type of projectile.
   The Navy confirmed Monday that experiments took place, but that
they didn't cause the explosion.
   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Craig Quigley noted Milligen had included
information about the unauthorized tests in his report, and had
mentioned the unauthorized use of five bags instead of six bags of
powder in the No. 2 gun turret, which exploded.
   ``The improper loading configuration did not cause, nor did it
contribute to, the explosion,'' Quigley said. ``Ditto for the
powder.''
   The report says such experiments had been conducted aboard the
Iowa from Nov. 4, 1987 until the day of the explosion.
   The report also notes Fred Moosally, the Iowa captain, had
approved the use of reduced charge loads, but that he thought that
meant six 55-pound bags of powder instead of the larger bags of
around 90-110 pounds.
   Moosally did not have the authority to approve such tests,
Quigley said.
   The report called for the Navy's inspector general to look into
the unauthorized tests, and Rear Adm. Ming Chang plans to do so,
Quigley said.
   Because of the many improper procedures found aboard the Iowa,
such as the gunpowder experiments, it has been left to Adm. Powell
F. Carter, the chief of the Atlantic Fleet, to decide whether
disciplinary action might be taken.
   The battleship currently is in the Mediterranean Sea.

   Educators already strapped by tight budgets as
they seek to improve classroom achievements face billions of dollars
in maintenance and construction costs in the next few years, the
National Governors' Association says.
   Local school districts, which historically have been responsible
for running and paying for their school buildings, have seen
maintenance costs increase 64 percent since 1983 _ to $41 billion,
according to a report the governors' association issued Monday.
   In addition, existing plans to renovate or build schools are
expected to cost $84 billion, the association's annual 50-state
survey said, warning the costs could undercut direct education
programs.
   ``The projected costs for new school construction and maintenance
and repairs for existing schools are so enormous that they can
overwhelm policy-makers,'' said the report, called ``Results in
Education: 1989.''
   ``When these estimates are broken down on a per-student or annual
basis over a 20-year period, the price tag may seem more manageable.
Still, unless addressed, the problem will mount as aging suburban
schools reach the end of their intended life span and urban and
rural schools deteriorate further.''
   The association said rural schools are particularly pressed,
noting another report that described half of the rural schools as
being unsafe, outdated and inadequate.
   In addition, the report said many school districts are seeing
money drained from their budgets to finance litigation because of
lawsuits.
   Several states are considering measures to relieve the pressure
on local officials by providing state support for school
construction costs, said the report.
   Iowa Gov. Terry E. Branstad, the association president, and New
Mexico Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers released the report a week before
the education summit the governors will have with President Bush in
Charlottesville, Va.
   ``It is time for us as governors to pay careful attention to what
is being taught in our schools and to what students are expected to
learn,'' Branstad said. ``Governors are powerful agents of change
and the report that we submit today is evidence of that fact.''
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers,
said ``the heart of this report is not so much in what the states
are doing, but in the introduction and unfinished agenda sections
that tell us what we have yet to do to turn our public schools
around.''
   Key findings of the report included:
   _32 states are improving teacher recruitment and retention. Five
states now have teacher licensing boards on which a majority of the
members are administrators and teachers. Thirteen states are trying
to increase the number of minority teachers.
   _41 states report new, expanded or proposed parent involvement
policies, including 16 with programs to assist parents in becoming
effective teachers at home.
   _31 states now offer pre-school and other early childhood
programs and 34 states offer alternative programs for high schools.
   _Nearly half the states use computers to maintain student
records, train teachers, evaluate curriculum and instruct students.
   ``Simply stated, restructuring means that we are trying to find
better ways to organize our schools, to prepare our teachers and to
determine what students must know and be able to do,'' said Branstad.

<HEAD>Cheney Promises More Aggressive Pentagon Role in Drug Fight</HEAD>

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, promising a
``more aggressive'' Pentagon role in the international drug battle,
is giving regional military leaders a month to come up with details
to carry it out.
   ``I think the relative level of effort _ compared to what has
been done in the past _ will be significantly greater,'' Cheney
pledged when he announced his project at a Pentagon briefing on
Monday.
   In an attempt to fulfill the Pentagon role as the nation's lead
agency in the drug interdiction effort, Cheney acknowledges that the
agency may ``have to make some tradeoffs'' because of ever-shrinking
budgets.
   But he said the new attentiveness toward illicit narcotics as a
national security threat should not ``in any way conflict with our
basic mission of defending the country.''
   Cheney said he had told the heads of the various major military
commands to draw up plans by Oct. 15 to use planes, ships, radar and
troops to help stem the flow of drugs into the United States.
   The secretary said he could not estimate the cost of the effort,
nor the number of servicemen and women needed, until the commanders
report back to him.
   Cheney said the Defense Department will emphasize stopping drugs
from entering the country, but also will help fight drug abuse and
aid other nations in attacking drugs at their source.
   ``I hope that our interdiction efforts will be more successful in
the future in part because we've got more aggressive efforts now
underway in the host countries and a greater willingness for them to
cooperate in our efforts,'' Cheney said.
   He said the Pentagon planned ``a more aggressive and robust
posture'' to help President Bush implement his anti-drug fight in
the Andean nations, as well.
   Until now, the Pentagon's role has been to support the efforts of
state National Guard units, which have been used for such duties as
inspecting cargo at ports of entry, taking part in aerial searches
for marijuana crops and helping transport law enforcement officials
or contraband. Those efforts have varied from state to state.
   Cheney insisted that in no case would the Pentagon be drawn into
a law enforcement role.
   Nor, he said, will U.S. forces overseas be sent into combat.
``There's a clear line out there,'' Cheney said, that the military
will not cross.
   ``It's a dangerous business. I hope nobody's hurt in the process,
but I can't guarantee it,'' Cheney said, adding that U.S. personnel
are acting under rules of engagement that allow them to defend
themselves.
   Asked whether he backed shooting down planes that refuse to
identify themselves and are suspected of smuggling drugs, as some in
Congress have suggested, Cheney said the department has no such
authority and does not intend to ask for it.
   Cheney said the department intends to deploy ``appropriate
elements of the Armed Forces'' to help reduce the flow of drugs into
the country, but cited no specific numbers or types of military
personnel.
   Among other things, the secretary said, he has asked the
commanders to:
   _Plan for a ``substantial Caribbean counter-narcotics task force,
with appropriate planes and ships,'' to cut the drug flow from Latin
America.
   _Study the use of military forces to support the counter-drug
work of U.S. law enforcement agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement
Administration, and ``cooperating foreign governments,'' in
particular Mexico.
   _Examine for the use of high-tech facilities available at NORAD
(North American Aerospace Defense Command) to help detect illegal
drug traffic coming across the nation's borders.
   _Find ways of combating the production and trafficking of illegal
drugs in conjunction with unnamed ``cooperating host countries.''

   An attorney who has been absent from the
``Night Stalker'' murder trial of Richard Ramirez was jailed for
failing to pay a $100 fine for contempt of court.
   Arturo Hernandez was held Monday in the hospital section of the
county's central jail and was to be released today, authorities said.
   Hernandez stopped representing Ramirez soon after a preliminary
hearing. Superior Court Judge Michael Tynan, perturbed at his
absence, ordered him back to court at one point but later agreed to
a daily telephone call from the attorney to see if he was needed.
   But Hernandez failed to do so, and was fined $100, Tynan's clerk
said.
   The court didn't receive the money. Tynan has since imposed a
$2,400 fine based on a scale for each day he failed to call. He said
Hernandez would be jailed again unless that fine is paid by Sept. 29.
   Ramirez, 29, is charged with being the devil worshipping killer
who invaded California homes in a 1985 rampage, killing 13 people.
The jury has deliberated for 20 days without a verdict.

   Senate Republicans concede President Bush's
anti-drug strategy needs some work, but their talks with Democrats
have left the two sides without agreement so far on how it should be
reshaped.
   Democratic and GOP senators planned to meet again today in their
search for a package of anti-drug measures agreeable to lawmakers of
both parties. The bargaining, which began Friday, is being fueled by
both sides' claim to the lead role in attacking illegal drugs and
drug-related crimes, issues party leaders say are uppermost on the
public's mind.
   A two-hour session Monday evening produced no deal.
   Republicans emerged saying they still supported the $7.9 billion
package for fiscal 1990, beginning Oct. 1, that Bush outlined Sept.
5. And Democrats said they remained behind the $10.1 billion plan
they countered with a week later, a proposal that garnered a quick
veto threat from White House aides.
   ``I don't think we're at the point yet where we know what they're
proposing, other than the president's plan,'' Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., author of the Democratic plan, said after the session.
   A general profile of a compromise that might ultimately arise
did, however, begin to emerge.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, the Republican's chief negotiator,
said GOP lawmakers ``are willing to help narrow the gap'' between
the two sides' spending proposals for treatment and prevention
programs. The Democrats want more emphasis on those initiatives than
Bush sought.
   Hatfield also said Republicans supported the Democratic concept
of paying for the extra anti-drug spending by cutting other programs
across the board. He said the amount the Democrats want to slice off
other programs would have to be reduced, and indicated other changes
in their plan might be sought as well.
   ``We agree on more than we disagree upon,'' Hatfield said.
   Bush's proposal, which would increase spending over this year's
efforts by $2.2 billion, would be weighted heavily to law
enforcement, prisons and interdiction. Prevention and treatment
programs would get 27 percent of the total.
   Byrd proposed not only beefing up the president's package but
changing the distribution. Of the $10.1 billion Byrd proposes, 65
percent would go to law enforcement and 35 percent to prevention and
treatment.
   That plan, backed by Senate Democratic leaders, would finance its
costs by snipping 0.575 percent from most of the budget. Bush
identified how he would pay for only about $750 million of his
proposal, suggesting cuts in a half-dozen other programs.
   Democrats said Bush's plan does not throw enough of a financial
punch at the problem. Before Byrd introduced his measure, some
Democrats said new taxes are needed to adequately finance anti-drug
initiatives.
   But Republicans have complained the Democratic alternative is too
costly and provides too much to prevention programs. They also
object to the $1.8 billion slice the across-the-board cuts would
take out of the Pentagon's $300 billion budget.

   The government should burn all semiautomatic
weapons, said former presidential press secretary James Brady, who
was disabled eight years ago during an assassination attempt on
then-President Reagan.
   ``We've stopped the importation of semiautomatic weapons,'' Brady
told reporters Monday.
   ``But we haven't gone all the way. At some point, you've got to
put your foot out there and draw a line in the sand and say, `No
more.'''
   Brady, 48, was in Pittsburgh to honor Westinghouse Electric Corp.
for its sponsorship of a program to help the disabled.
   A bullet fired by John Hinckley pierced the right side of Brady's
brain. He now is vice president of the National Organization on
Disability and has lobbied for gun control.

<HEAD>President Says No Hard Intelligence His Family Is Target</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush says he has no ``hard
evidence'' his family has been threatened by drug lords, although
members of his family are reported to be getting extra security.
   ``I can't say I'm totally unconcerned, but I don't have any hard
evidence that should further alarm the American people in this
context,'' Bush said when asked whether he knew of threats against
his family.
   ``Clearly any such action would I think just bring down the
entire wrath of the American people and the American government,''
said Bush, in Helena on a two-day western trip.
   The Secret Service beefed up security Friday for Dorothy Bush
LeBlond, the president's daughter who lives near Portland, Maine.
   Newsweek magazine also reported in this week's editions that Bush
ordered 24-hour Secret Service protection for his five adult
children at the recommendation of the agency.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined comment Monday.
``We don't comment on security, period,'' he said.
   Neither Secret Service spokesman Robert Snow nor authorities in
Portland would say specifically why the action for Mrs. LeBlond was
taken. But local police said they were notified of the service's
plan to increase security for Mrs. LeBlond before five Colombian men
were arrested with a large arsenal of firearms in Canada near the
Maine border last Wednesday.
   Mrs. LeBlond, who is separated from the husband and has two
children, and her brothers and sisters did not respond to telephone
calls. The other children are Jeb in Miami, George Jr., in Dallas,
Neil in Denver and Marvin in Alexandria, Va.
   The president and his family are authorized to receive
round-the-clock Secret Service protection.
   Family members can turn down Secret Service protection with
presidential approval. A White House source who spoke on condition
on anonymity said Bush's children were not guarded on a regular
basis in the past.

   A trustees' committee and the director of the
Corcoran Gallery of Art are seeking to heal relations with the art
community by expressing regret for canceling a planned exhibit that
included sexually provocative photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe.
   ``Our course in the future will be to support art, artists and
freedom of artistic expression,'' they said in a statement released
Monday.
   The June cancellation was an attempt to avoid a worsening
political controversy over the use of federal funds by the National
Endowment for the Arts to back controversial works, the Corcoran's
director, Christina Orr-Cahall, has said.
   The action, however, seemed to have attracted more attention to
the issue on all sides, and many artists have denounced the
Corcoran, the nation's oldest art museum.
   Several artists have called for a boycott and two have pulled out
of Corcoran exhibits. Artist Lowell Nesbitt withdrew $1 million in
property and art he had intended to will the museum.
   The exhibit photographs by the late Mapplethorpe was staged at
the Washington Project for the Arts, meanwhile, and drew record
crowds.
   The statement from Orr-Cahall and the executive committee of the
trustees said, ``By withdrawing from the Mapplethorpe exhibition,
we, the Board of Trustees and the Director, have inadvertently
offended many members of the arts community, which we deeply
regret.''
   Endowment funds totalling $45,000 were used to prepare the
exhibition and also to show a photograph by Andre Serrano of the
crucified Christ in a jar of urine.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., had begun a drive to bar endowment
funds to support any sexually explicit or blasphemous material. The
Senate has enacted such a provision in the endowment's
appropriations bill; the House has refused to go along and simply
voted to reduce the appropriation by $45,000. The two versions will
have to be reconciled.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities held steady in Monday's auction at the lowest level in
several months.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.64 percent, the same as last week's
rate. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills, also at an
average discount rate of 7.64 percent, the same as last week.
   The rates for the two weeks were the lowest since three-month
bills sold for 7.54 percent on Nov. 6, 1988 and six-month bills
averaged 7.35 percent last July 31.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.90 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,806.90 and 8.06 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,613.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.07
percent last week, down from 8.27 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>FCC Decision to Waive Radio Operator Requirement Sparks Concern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil companies have obtained waivers from the
Federal Communications Commission to eliminate radio officers on
many tankers, a cost-cutting move that critics contend will increase
the chances of oil spills.
   The FCC requirement that all large ships carry at least one
trained radio officer originated in the 1930s, when ships needed
someone skilled in the pit-pat-pit of Morse code, says Exxon
Shipping Co. spokesman Leslie C. Rogers.
   ``Since that kind of radio telegraphy is obsolete, there's no
longer a need for a job category like this on these merchant
ships,'' Rogers said in a telephone interview Monday.
   But two unions _ the American Radio Officers Association and the
Radio Officers Union, which represent about 600 sea-going officers _
are objecting to the waivers on safety grounds.
   With support from some ship captains, they contend that every
large merchant ship should carry someone trained to repair radio
equipment and handle communications during an emergency, leaving the
captain and mates free to supervise other operations, such as
firefighting and damage control.
   The FCC's critics point to the case of the Exxon Philadelphia,
which in April suffered an apparent breakdown of an electronic fuel
sensor that left it drifting aimlessly off the West Coast for nearly
seven hours with 22 million gallons of oil aboard.
   The ship's radio officer, who had been eliminated under an FCC
waiver just a few weeks earlier, might have quickly solved the
problem because of the officer's expertise in electronics, they
claim.
   Exxon, however, says it is doubtful that a radio officer would
have made a difference in the case. The company also maintains it
has ensured safe communications on its tankers by installing
duplicate radio systems and training various crewmembers to operate
them.
   ``This is just a false issue raised by certain unions trying to
capitalize on the unfortunate Alaskan oil spill,'' said Rogers.
   William Luther, an adviser to the FCC on international shipping,
said the government began granting waivers in 1982 to eliminate
radio operators on U.S.-registered oil tankers and large cargo
vessels operating along the U.S. coast.
   Despite objections by more than a dozen environmental groups,
those coastal waivers have continued and additional waivers have
been extended this year on a ship-by-ship basis to 30 to 40 other
vessels plying the waters from Alaska to Panama, Luther said.
   Luther said the simplicity and sophistication of automated and
satellite communications ``eliminate the need for the intermediate
operator any more.''
   Some companies, including Arco Marine, the shipping arm of
Atlantic Richfield Corp., have decided to retain radio specialists,
primarily because of their ability to make repairs. But more than
half a dozen major shippers, including Mobil, Texaco, Sunoco and
Chevron, have applied for and received new waivers, the FCC said.
   Mobil Shipping Co. spokesman John Lord contended that
technological improvements, including ship-to-satellite transmitters
and snap-in circuit boards, have made communications more reliable
than ever.
   ``It's far safer now, when the guy in charge on the bridge can
just pick up a phone and have instantaneous, voice-to-voice contact
with points all over the globe,'' he said. ``Morse code and all that
is just not necessary any more.''
   But a ship's captain, speaking to The Boston Globe on condition
of anonymity, said the added responsibility for communications could
be a problem in an emergency.
   ``What if I get in trouble?'' he said. ``Say my ship is on fire,
or I send an S.O.S. Do I stay on the bridge and direct firefighting,
or do I go in the radio room? Where am I supposed to go now?''

   A teen-ager known as ``Iron Man'' was
charged with four slayings in his neighborhood after he made
incriminating statements that clinched his connection to the crimes,
police said.
   Craig E. Price, 15, was arraigned Monday at Family Court under
heavy security because of death threats. Under state law he cannot
be charged as an adult and if found delinquent faces no more than
six years in juvenile prison.
   The 240-pound, 5-foot-10 Price was described by friends and
neighbors as a popular, rambunctious youth more inclined to football
than studies.
   He was arrested Sunday at his home, a block from the house where
he allegedly beat and stabbed to death a woman and her two daughters
during Labor Day weekend, and two doors from the house of a woman
stabbed to death in 1987.
   A search of Price's house produced evidence including a weapon
that may have been used killings, Police Chief Wesley Blanchard
said. He declined to describe the items.
   ``We have physical evidence to tie in every step along the way,''
Blanchard said, although he indicated Price's self-incriminating
statements were the primary evidence in the 1987 case.
   Judge Carmen DiPetrillo ordered Price held at the state Training
School. He scheduled a hearing Thursday for prosecutors to detail
evidence.
   About 30 people gathered outside the courthouse, including some
of Price's friends who claimed he could not have killed anyone.
   Sheriff Antonio Giorgio said all 22 officers on his force in this
town of about 90,000 people were called in because ``you get
disgruntled neighbors, angry neighbors and you have to protect
against something happening.''
   Price is charged with three counts of deliquency first-degree
murder and one count of burglary in the deaths of Joan Heaton, 39,
and her daughters, Jennifer, 10, and Melissa, 8, who were found in
their home Sept. 4.
   He is charged with one count of deliquency first-degree murder
and one count of deliquency burglary in the 1987 stabbing of Rebecca
A. Spencer, 27.
   If found delinquent, Price could be held at the juvenile prison
only until age 21, said state Attorney General James E. O'Neil.
   Price was a suspect in the Heaton killings ``right from the
start'' because of a cut on his hand and his conflicting statements
about it, said Blanchard.
   ``If you wish to call it a confession you can refer to it as that
_ but he gave a statement to the investigating detectives which
would very strongly implicate himself and no others in both
homicides,'' Blanchard said.
   Blanchard, however, said the motive is uncertain.
   An autopsy revealed the three victims had bruises and numerous
broken bones, apparently from a struggle with their killer, leading
police to speculate the killer might have been cut or injured.
   Scott Putnam, 18, a friend of Price's who waited outside the
courthouse, said he lived with the Prices until a few days ago and
Price showed him a cut left index finger when Putnam returned home
at about 1 a.m. Sept. 2.
   ``You could see the bone on one side. It was deep,'' Putnam said.
Price told him he had punched out a car window, Putnam said.
   Police have said an intruder broke into the Heaton home through a
rear window.
   Price, who played varsity football last year, was ineligible to
play this year because he had been held back in the ninth grade. His
mother, father and older brother attended the hearing but had no
comment.
   Price's lawyer, public defender Robert E. Marro, declined to
comment.

   A heavily armed teen-ager apparently acting out
author Stephen King's thriller ``Rage'' took 11 classmates hostage
during a daylong standoff that ended with his surrender after nine
hours, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported.
   Dustin Pierce, a 17-year-old, straight-A student, was detained by
police Monday evening after he released his last two hostages, laid
down three guns and surrendered.
   Charges were not immediately filed.
   A copy of ``Rage'' and some personal writings found in Pierce's
room at his grandparent's house were helpful in giving negotiators
clues to what he planned, said state police Detective Bob Stephens,
who negotiated with Pierce.
   Stephens said he had been worried by parts of Pierce's writing
that indicated ``suicide was what we'd have to deal with at the
end.''
   In King's novel, a teen-ager enraged at his father takes hostages
at a school, is shot and wounded by police and ends up in an
institution.
   Like the character in the book, Pierce was upset with his father,
whom he had not seen for 13 years, and asked to see him, authorities
said.
   Police arranged to have the father, whose name was not released,
brought from Delray Beach, Fla., but Pierce surrendered before his
arrival.
   The trouble appears to have begun Sunday evening when Pierce's
friend Brian Bond picked him up at his grandparents' house so the
two could study together, said Paul Bond, Brian's uncle.
   When it became late and they had not returned, authorities were
called and began searching for Bond's red pickup truck.
   The standoff began around 9:30 a.m. Monday, when Pierce and Bond
roared into the high school parking lot aboard the truck.
   Authorities said that at some point during the disappearance
Pierce pointed a gun at Bond, in effect abducting him.
   Bond, the son of high school principal Betty Bond, was the first
hostage released.
   Craig Eversole, a 16-year-old junior, was in the classroom when
Pierce entered.
   ``He shot the ceiling and told the teacher to leave and let two
rows of students leave,'' Eversole said. Later, Pierce fired his
only other shot, blowing out a classroom window.
   Throughout the day, Stephens traded food, cigarettes and soft
drinks for hostages.
   Stephens said Pierce was solicitous of his hostages, asking for
cigarettes on their behalf and even releasing one who needed to go
to the bathroom.
   ``He said he wasn't going to hurt nobody,'' Eversole said. ``He
said he wasn't going to shoot nobody.''
   After Pierce's arrival, the students he first released warned
others and the classrooms were cleared.
   Eversole said Pierce was armed with a .357-caliber Magnum
revolver, a .44-caliber revolver and a .12 gauge shotgun that had
been altered. ``It looked like one you'd see in a movie,'' Eversole
said.
   More than a dozen state police officers went to the school just
south of McKee, a town of about 1,000 people some 65 miles southeast
of Lexington.
   Police were concerned about references in Pierce's writing to
dying at 9 o'clock. ``He said it'll all end at 9,'' Stephens said.
``We didn't want that 9 o'clock hour.''
   Pierce surrendered at 6:30 p.m.
   Sharon Judd, who had gone to school with Pierce since fourth
grade, called him a quiet, straight-A student who liked guns.
   ``Many of the school reports Pierce did dealt with war,'' she
said.
   After taking over the classroom, Pierce's only persistent demand
was to talk to his father, Stephens said.
   ``He hasn't seen his father, my understanding, since he's 4 years
old,'' Stephens said. Pierce had lived with his grandparents for
several years.
   Near the end of the standoff, police called on a cousin and close
friend of Pierce's to convince him no harm would come to him.
   Chad Madden, an 18-year-old freshman at nearby Eastern Kentucky
University, said he and his cousin talked about hunting.
   ``I just talked like I always do,'' Madden said. ``He was calm,
pretty smooth. He started to cry a little bit when I was talking.''
   At that point, tired and tense, Pierce was looking for a way to
end the standoff, Stephens said.
   ``He wanted to know how many crimes he committed,'' Stephens said.

   Federal officials praised
Burroughs Wellcome Co.'s decision to reduce the wholesale price of
AZT by 20 percent, but some AIDS activists say the cut isn't deep
enough.
   ``This is a step in the right direction, but a very small step,''
says Peter Staley of the New York-based AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power. ``It's not enough.''
   Burroughs Wellcome Co. announced Monday that it will lower the
wholesale cost of the only federally approved AIDS treatment, citing
production efficiencies and research that suggests an increasing
demand for the drug.
   ``The expected growth in patient population, coupled with recent
production economies, will reduce somewhat our financial risk and
will remove some of the uncertainties which existed when this drug
was first introduced,'' said T.E. Haigler Jr., Burroughs' president
and chief executive officer.
   The company said, however, it couldn't guarantee that the full
savings will be passed on to consumers, who have been paying $7,000
to $8,000 per year for full doses of the drug.
   The reduction cuts the price to the wholesale distributor from
$1.50 to $1.20 per capsule.
   A patient now paying almost $8,000 a year for a high-dose, 12
capsule-a-day prescription of AZT would pay more than $6,500 a year
with the lower price. People who are infected with the virus but who
have few or no symptoms of AIDS generally have a five-capsules-a-day
prescription, and would see their costs reduced to about $2,700 a
year.
   Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services, said the price cut, combined with recent findings that
lower dosages may be effective, will reduce the cost of AZT
treatment.
   ``This is good news for those infected with HIV who can benefit
from AZT treatment, and it is good news for the health care system
as a whole,'' Sullivan said.
   The cut was announced after mounting protests by AIDS activists
against Burroughs Wellcome. On Thursday, five people chained
themselves to a banister at the New York Stock Exchange to protest
the cost of AZT, also called Retrovir.
   Activists argued that some AIDS patients could not afford the
drug and that the price discouraged Congress from renewing a program
that subsidizes the cost of the medicine for patients who cannot
afford it.
   The medical establishment also criticized prices of AZT and other
AIDS drugs last week. In an article published Friday in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, researchers blamed ``price
gouging by drug companies'' for part of the estimated $5 billion
annually it may someday cost to care for AIDS victims.
   Company spokesman Thack Brown insisted that the protests did not
affect Burroughs Wellcome's decision.
   ``Actually, I can say the protests slowed things down a little
bit,'' he said. ``We had to field inquiries from the media and other
people about what we planned to do at a time when we were still
trying to decide what that would be.''
   Staley, whose group is know as ACTUP, said activists will
continue to press for lower prices.
   ``ACTUP will continue to fight to make sure that all AIDS
treatments are provided to all who need them, free of charge, which
means we will continue to pressure Burroughs Wellcome for further
price reductions,'' he said.
   Jean McGuire of the Washington, D.C.-based AIDS Action Council
said the price cut ``is large enough to characterize it as being in
good faith, but it remains to be seen whether it's enough.''
   She added that activists will continue to assess Burroughs'
profit margin. ``We hope that as the market increases, we will
continue to see Burroughs make good faith assessments about future
reductions,'' she said.
   AZT was first shown to be effective against HIV infection in
September 1986. A trial of the drug revealed a significantly lower
mortality rate among patients with AIDS and advanced AIDS-related
complex who had received AZT. During the next six months, Burroughs
made AZT available free to about 5,000 patients. The company lowered
the cost 20 percent in 1987.
   AZT was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March
1987.

   The dollar ended lower against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell marginally.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 1.47 points,
or 0.004 percent, closing at 34,471.07. It had gained 70.66 points
the previous day.
   The dollar closed at 145.73 yen, down 0.70 yen from Monday's
close of 146.43 yen. It opened at 145.70 yen, and moved between
145.59 yen and 146.15 yen.
   Although the index gained some 100 points soon after the market
opened, it turned downward as some market players stopped buying and
others sold for profit-taking, said a dealer with Nikko Securities,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``There was no specific element that reversed the upswing. It
seemed that participants could not figure out what they should do
next after buying aggressively,'' he said.
   Other dealers said the index started higher as market players
were reassured by the yen's rebound against the dollar, but it fell
back due to speculative investors' selling to make technical
adjustments.
   In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate was moving nervously
around the 146-yen level after opening lower, following a similar
downswing on overseas markets overnight, traders said.
   The dollar then rose as institutional investors bought the dollar
near its low. The majority of market players remained on the
sidelines, however, ahead of talks among the Group of Seven
industrialized nations this weekend, said a trader with the Bank of
Tokyo, speaking anonymously.
   Participating in the G-7 meeting in Washington will be monetary
officials and central bankers from the United States, West Germany,
France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan.

   An uncharacteristically taciturn Zsa
Zsa Gabor heeded a judge's warning to refrain from comment about
issues surrounding her cop-slapping trial.
   ``I'm under gagging order,'' Miss Gabor told reporters in the
halls of Beverly Hills Municipal Court as her trial entered its
second week Monday.
   Miss Gabor faces four misdemeanor charges: battery on a police
officer, disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired
license and having an open container of alcohol in her car. If
convicted, she could be sentenced to 18 months behind bars.
   Miss Gabor uttered ``no comment'' more than seven times when
questioned by reporters. She even said ``no comment'' when asked
about her ensemble of white slacks and a Navy blue blazer.
   Last week, Miss Gabor said she was afraid of going to jail
because of lesbians there. She also made unflattering remarks about
the prosecutor (``He has a Napoleon complex'') and called the
policeman she is accused of striking an ``Adonis'' and ``a liar.''
   Besides the gag order warning, Miss Gabor told reporters, ``My
mother is very upset and (sister) Eva could kill me'' regarding the
publicity accompanying the trial.
   In testimony Monday, prosecution witness Maureen Cassidy said she
was looking in her rear-view mirror when she saw Officer Paul Kramer
being struck on June 14.
   Kramer had pulled over Miss Gabor for having expired registration
tags. As he checked for other violations, Miss Gabor allegedly drove
off, was stopped again and ultimately slapped Kramer's face.
   Kramer has said the slap was unprovoked. Miss Gabor, a
foot-shorter and 100 pounds lighter than Kramer, has said she struck
in self defense.
   For the defense, a Beverly Hills physician testified that Miss
Gabor ``was hurting all over'' after her arrest.
   Harold Karpman, a cardiovascular specialist, said Miss Gabor
called him after the incident and complained of ``anxiety and
nervousness and pain and discomfort.''
   Kenneth Elconin, an orthopedic surgeon, said he saw bruises on
Miss Gabor's wrists when she visited him two days after her arrest.
   The bruises probably were caused by handcuffs, Elconin said.
   A third defense witness, Dr. Elias Cohenzadeh, said Kramer used
excessive force when he was pulled over for speeding two years ago.
``I've never felt so threatened in my life,'' Cohenzadeh said,
claiming the officer threw him down on the ground.
   The defense has contended that the officer has a history of being
abusive with people he has pulled over for traffic violations.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jay Stewart, the ebullient announcer of the
popular television game show ``Let's Make a Deal,'' shot and killed
himself at his home. He was 71.
   Officers were called to the Hollywood home after neighbors and
relatives reported hearing a gunshot, police detective Russell
Kuster said.
   Stewart, whose real name was Jay Fix, was pronounced dead at the
scene.
   ``Let's Make A Deal,'' with host Monty Hall, was first shown on
NBC in 1963 and later moved to ABC until 1976.
   The show also was seen in syndication and more recently was
revived by the USA Cable network. It is not in production now, Hall
said Monday through a spokesman.
   ``Jay Stewart was a member of our `Let's Make a Deal' family for
13 years,'' Hall said. ``His booming voice and his bubbly
personality endeared him to millions. Those of us who worked with
him on a daily basis appreciated his talents. He was more than an
announcer, he was my co-star and my friend.''
   ``Let's Make a Deal'' opened with a drum roll and Stewart's voice
over a shot of three numbered doors. Contestants were selected from
the audience, whose members wore costumes.
   A popular feature was ``Jay's Tray,'' which contained a hidden
item, sometimes valuable, sometimes not. The announcer brought the
tray to Hall, who then bargained with a contestant over its value.
   Kuster said Stewart shot himself as he stood just outside the
entrance to the detached garage of his home Sunday morning. He left
a note, and a will, said Kuster, who declined to give further
details.
   Early this year, Stewart retired from announcing and became an
agent for emcees and announcers, specializing in game shows, said
talent agent Don Pitts.
   Pitts said the death came as ``a complete shock to all of us. As
far as we knew his health was fine. ... He was always a very
positive, `up' kind of person.''
   The note left behind, according to Pitts, gave a different
perspective. ``Jay said he had been hurting for a long, long time,''
Pitts said.
   Stewart was a native of Indianapolis. His first job in radio was
at WBOW in Terre Haute, Ind. From there he went to Cincinnati's WLW
as an announcer and emcee.
   In 1943, Stewart got a job at KNX, a CBS radio station in Los
Angeles.
   During his career he announced for several radio and television
shows, including the ``Kate Smith Hour,'' ``Carnation Family
Party,'' and ``It's Fun to Be Young.''
   He is survived by his wife, Phyllis, and two daughters. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People in the capital emerged from
shelter onto streets scattered with shards of glass, chunks of
concrete, snapped palm trees and tons of debris that attracted
plenty of scavengers.
   Travel was treacherous after Hurricane Hugo's 125 mph winds
snapped power lines across this Caribbean island's hard-hit
northeastern sections as the storm skirted the coast on a
north-northwestern tack Monday.
   Flooding was widespread, with surging waters reaching up to the
hoods of cars. The high water forced this correspondent to turn back
after attempting to reach the international airport, where damaged
planes included a DC-3 that had been tossed onto a hangar.
   Authorities said nearly 28,000 people lost homes in the storm.
There were no immediate reports of deaths.
   Bands of youths looted stores in San Juan, while others scavenged
rubble and metal from storm-damaged buildings. Some carted away
truckloads of aluminium siding and zinc roofing.
   People on foot struggled to carry loads they could barely handle.
   In the ritzy Condado Beach neighborhood, perhaps the city's
worst-hit area, most hotels had windows blown out and hotel awnings
lay shattered on the ground. Many palm trees were uprooted, others
lost their fronds.
   As the storm receded and dusk fell, clean-up crews started work
with bulldozers to remove the debris from city streets. Waist-deep
waters in some areas of the city prevented any salvage work.
   San Juan remained in total darkness Monday night, with no
estimate of when power might be returned to the capital.
Communication with the outside world, completely cut during the
storm's height, was gradually being restored.
   Six hours after the worst winds, thousands of people cruised San
Juan's streets in cars, looking at the damage and causing traffic
jams citywide.
   Residents of one San Juan neighborhood said its tall buildings
swayed in the winds, and one said it felt like being aboard a ship.
The rain blew sideways and pieces of metal and other debris flew
through the air.
   In a boutique on the ground floor of the two-story building
housing the Associated Press bureau in San Juan, young looters
defied winds hitting 100 mph at the height of the storm and carried
out armloads of women's clothing. The AP buro's office was nearly
destroyed in the storm by broken glass and rain.
   A giant Banyan tree lay across a major avenue, its roots sticking
in the air. The Bal do Rioty avenue, which leads from the hotel zone
to the international airport, was lined with fallen almond trees.
   Many cars lay damaged by fallen trees and one car was completely
flattened by a concrete slab from a nearby building.
   In a working-class section of San Juan, utility poles tilted for
blocks with wires dangling, making streets nearly impassable.

   Mrs. Bush, who lives in Greenwich, was admitted to Greenwich

<HEAD>Generals, Admirals Facing Human Rights Charges To Be Pardoned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem says he
will pardon 18 retired generals and admirals who face charges they
committed hundreds of human rights abuses in the 1970s during the
armed forces' war on leftists.
   The cases of six other people, including two former presidents
already convicted and sentenced, will be considered at a later date,
Menem said late Sunday in a brief interview with state-run
television.
   Menem, who took office in July, said ordered the pardon ``for the
good of my country'' and due to the ``need for reconciliation to
pacify Argentina.
   ``It is not possible to continue living in an ignominious past
that wounds us all,'' Menem told Channel 7.
   Menem's statement was the first firm indication of who would be
included in the controversial pardon, expected to be formally
announced after his return Sept. 28 from a visit to the United
States.
   ``This is getting worse and worse,'' said Hebe Bonafini, founder
of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a group made up of relatives of
people who disappeared during the 1970s. ``All the military is
responsible for what happened _ for the kidnappings, the torture and
the disappearances.''
   Sixteen retired generals and two admirals face trial in civilian
courts on hundreds of charges, including kidnapping, torture and
murder, growing out of a brutal campaign conducted against leftists
during the 1976-83 military regime.
   Six others were convicted of similar charges in 1984 and are
serving terms ranging from eight years to life at a military prison.
   They are former military presidents Gens. Jorge Videla and
Roberto Viola, former Navy commanders Adms. Emilio Massera and
Armando Lambruschini and former Buenos Aires provincial police
chiefs Gens. Ramon Camps and Osvaldo Riccheri.
   A government commission named by Menem's predecessor, former
President Raul Alfonsin, determined that at least 8,900 Argentines
disappeared during the anti-subversion campaign and were presumed
dead.
   Human rights groups have accused the armed forces of genocide.
   Menem, who took office July 8, made no reference to former
leftist guerrilla leader Mario Firmenich, now serving a 30-year
sentence for kidnapping and murder. Unconfirmed reports have
indicated his case might be considered along with those of the
convicted military men.
   Menem repeatedly has said he intends to resolve the ``military
question'' before the end of the year and put an end to
civilian-military tension stemming from the trials of officers.
   But the possibility of a pardon has angered human rights groups,
who organized a Sept. 8 opposition march in Buenos Aires and other
major cities.
   Government officials said Monday the pardon also would include
military officers facing disciplinary action for taking part in
three insurrections in April 1987 and January and December 1988,
during the Alfonsin presidency.
   The revolts, which were quelled with little bloodshed, were aimed
at ending the military trials.
   The number of those officers facing action never has been
announced, but they are estimated to total about 100, including Lt.
Col. Aldo Rico, leader of the first two revolts, and Col. Mohamed
Ali Seineldin, who led the third.

<HEAD>Last Day of Storm Brings Tornadoes as Grape Growers Assess Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms and heavy rains drenched
northern California for a third day, dashing hopes of a fruitful
grape harvest in the region's wine country.
   ``We were talking about a very large chardonnay crop this year.
We can forget about quantity now and we'll have to see about
quality,'' said Andrew Beckstoffer, the biggest wine grape supplier
in Mendocino County with 2,000 acres.
   Growers in Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino counties worked in the
fields and hoped for sunshine as the sun broke through clouds Monday
afternoon after three days of rain. The deluge drenched the
vineyards, threatening more than 11,000 acres of grapes that can
fetch about $1,800 a ton or more.
   Wine producers were most concerned about the chardonnay and
sauvignon blanc fruit, which had been close to maturity before the
storm _ the remnants of Hurricane Octave _ struck.
   The growers hoped hot, dry weather, or at least cool and windy
weather, would help negate the effects of the rain. The National
Weather Service forecast fair and warmer weather today and warm, dry
weather the rest of the week.
   ``There's going to be some rot, even if the sun comes out now and
everything turns out right,'' said Beckstoffer, whose workers began
pulling the leaves out of the bottom of the vines to help them dry
faster. ``The thing that scares me is that this (rain) might not
end. We might be in for the start of cold, wet winter.''
   At Sebastiani Vineyards in Sonoma, vice president and executive
winemaster Doug Davis said he could see some bunch rot already,
especially on the tissue-paper thin skin of chardonnay and sauvignon
blanc grapes.
   Most of the approximately 190 vineyards in Napa Valley grow the
threatened grapes. Champagne grapes, which mature earlier, escaped
the damage. Red wine grapes, harvested in October, also were
expected to be in good shape.
   The cost of picking the white wine grapes is likely to soar
because of the weather. Picking them selectively takes longer and
could push labor costs from about $100 a ton per farm worker up to
about $140 a ton.
   Alice and Ray Burch, whose family has owned Mallard Winery Inc.
in Napa for five generations, reserved helicopters to blow their
crops dry when the rain stops. They said this is the first time in
more than 10 years that they have had to use helicopters to save a
crop.

   The dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index declined by a tiny
fraction.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 1.47 points,
or 0.004 percent, closing at 34,471.07. It had gained 70.66 points
the previous day.
   The dollar closed at 145.73 yen, down 0.70 yen from Monday's
146.43-yen finish. It opened at 145.70 yen and ranged between 145.59
yen and 146.15 yen.
   Currency trading was inactive, said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a senior
trader with Daiwa Bank.
   ``Although quite a few market players have had long dollar
holding positions, they didn't sell as many dollars as we had
expected, mainly because they had no dollar-selling incentives,'' he
said.
   ``The market's major concern was whether G-7 (group of seven
industrial) nations can reach agreement on how to work on
international interest rate gaps,'' Kinugasa said.
   ``The problem is that the United States doesn't seem to have made
up its mind on what to do with its interest rates and the rising
dollar,'' he added.
   Many market players remained on the sidelines ahead of a G-7
meeting this weekend, traders said.
   Participating in the meeting, opening Saturday in Washington,
will be monetary officials and central bankers from the United
States, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and Japan.
   On the stock exchange, the market's main barometer gained about
100 points in early trading but fell back again, dealers said.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co., said
market players avoided major moves except for technical adjustments
involving some companies whose account settlements for the first
half of fiscal 1989 year are scheduled for Wednesday.
   ``The index rose back a bit toward the end of the afternoon
session as market players bought for their arbitrage deals,'' he
said.
   Arbitrage is a common technique to make profits out of prices gap
between the spot and futures markets.
   Nomura said many stock market players were deeply concerned about
the dollar's recent strength, which has been the major discouraging
factor in the market.
   Trading was inactive, with first section volume estimated at 650
million shares, up from Monday's 450 million.

<HEAD>Researchers Says Altered Cells Appear To Shrink Cancer Tumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Genetically altered cancer-fighting cells have
shrunk tumors in one patient and cells from a single injection
continue to work for at least 19 days, according to researchers.
   Five patients, all terminally ill with a cancer called malignant
melanoma, have been treated with gene-modified cells, Dr. Steven
Rosenberger, a National Cancer Institute researcher, said Monday.
   The lymphocytes, a type of cancer-fighting cell, used in the
study are natural cancer-fighting cells that had been cultured from
cells withdrawn from the woman's tumors.
   Rosenberg and his colleagues have developed a technique wherein
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TIL cells, are cultured in the
laboratory in interleukin-2, a protein that promotes lymphocyte
growth. When the cells multiply to 200 billion, they are then
reinjected into the patient's blood stream as an army of cancer
fighters.

   Senate Democrats have created a panel to study
the nation's housing needs and recommend reforms in the Department
of Housing and Urban Development.
   Sen. Alan Cranston of California, named to head the eight-member
task force, said Monday that one of its purposes will be to prod the
Bush administration to take a position on housing for the
disadvantaged.
   The task force will issue a report and make recommendations by
the end of the year, said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of
Maine. He said housing legislation ``will be a high priority for
next year.''

   The federal government, Puerto Rican communities in the United
States and voluntary relief agencies have started relief efforts to
help communities struck by Hurricane Hugo.
   The mobilization came as the storm lashed Puerto Rico after
battering the U.S. Virgin Islands and other tourist havens, leaving
at least 14 people dead and tens of thousands homeless.
   U.S. Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan, attending a
conference in Honolulu with top officials of U.S. territories in the
Pacific and Caribbean, said Monday $500,000 in emergency assistance
funds have been released to aid the storm-stricken areas.
   Lujan said he will leave Hawaii Wednesday night to return to
Washington to plan a tour of the devastation in the Virgin Islands.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez-Colon of Puerto Rico said late Monday that
Hugo left at least 27,900 people homeless. He said he would ask
President Bush to declare the island a disaster area.
   In New York, bank accounts, hotlines and phone-a-thons are being
set up by the city's Puerto Rican community to aid hurricane victims.
   The Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in the United
States, an organization run by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,
began to coordinate disaster relief efforts by churches, banks and
individuals around the city.
   ``I have my whole family there _ my mother, my sister, my
friends, my aunts, my grandmother,'' said Ruth Noemi Colon, a
spokeswoman for the agency. ``I talked to them last night. I haven't
any information today. You can tell how I feel _ I'm worried.''
   Meanwhile, an organization of voluntary relief agencies urged the
public to donate cash rather than goods in an effort to avoid
problems that have occurred during several past disasters, when
agencies were inundated with unneeded goods that hampered delivery
of needed items.
   For example, people donated 1,000 pairs of high-heeled shoes to
victims of a Mexican earthquake, while boots and wool sweaters were
offered to Jamaica after a hurricane last year and earthquake
victims in Peru got 7,000 bras.
   ``Goods should not be collected or sent unless they have been
requested by the disaster-stricken country or private voluntary
organizations,'' said InterAction, a membership group of relief
agencies.
   When a need is identified following a disaster, local American
Red Cross chapters can help report which supplies are needed,
InterAction suggested.
   Otherwise, cash is the best way to make a contribution, because
relief workers can then purchase goods that are actually needed,
officials said.
   InterAction represents about 120 voluntary relief organizations,
including American Red Cross, CARE, Save the Children, World Vision,
Oxfam and the Christian Children's Fund.
   New Yorkers with roots in Puerto Rico hoped for the best. Pilar
Alamo, who has lived in the city for five years, said she last spoke
to her family Sunday.
   ``They had candles and a small gas stove and tried to board up a
couple of glass windows,'' said Alamo, whose siblings, parents and
grandparents live together in Bayamon. ``They live in a cement house
but it's always worse in the poorer communities where they live in
shacks or wooden houses.''

   The contestant likely to be remembered in
Miss America Pageant history as the one who got plunked on the head
with a beer bottle said she detested the way pageant officials
treated the women.
   ``I hated being herded around with 50 other women,'' said Tamara
Toshiba Marler, Miss Oklahoma, in an interview with The Daily
Oklahoman on Monday. ``We were intelligent, professional women and
we were treated like little girls.''
   Ms. Marler, one of 10 finalists, suffered a concussion when
struck by the bottle during Friday night's parade along Atlantic
City, N.J.'s Boardwalk.
   She spent the night in the hospital but competed in Saturday
night's competition.
   ``The pageant officials wouldn't even let me talk to the media
while I was in the hospital,'' she said. ``They were afraid of the
bad publicity.''
   Ms. Marler, a University of Tulsa marketing graduate, said she
thought she had been shot when the bottle bonked her on the head.
   ``Blood was gushing all over me,'' she said. ``People were trying
to cover me, and there was broken glass all over the place.''
   Ms. Marler said she felt light-headed Saturday night, but didn't
think the injury affected her performance.
   ``I think the judges might have been more affected by the
incident than I was,'' she said. ``They may have decided not to give
me any sympathy points, but we'll never know for sure.''

   A businessman has been sentenced to 30 months
in prison for conspiring to send Iran deadly nerve gas, which the
prosecutor called a weapon of genocide.
   Juwhan Yun, 48, will serve no more than 22 months because U.S.
District Judge H. Lee Sarokin gave him credit for time served after
the Jan. 12 arrest.
   Yun was convicted May 19 of conspiring to export arms illegally.
   In his sentencing Monday, Sarokin said the weapon _ the nerve gas
sarin _ had the capability of inflicting massive casualties.
   But the judge noted that there was no chance of the gas ever
leaving the United States because Yun's arms contact was in fact an
undercover Customs Service agent.
   He also said it was questionable whether Yun ever would have
committed a crime if the agent, Richard Kennan, had not intervened.
   Yun, in addressing Sarokin, blamed Kennan for his troubles.
   ``I still believe I am victim of Mr. Kennan, for his achievement
and advancement,'' he said. Yun also accused the government of
racism in targeting him, a Korean-American, because of his heavy
accent.
   Customs agents were tipped off by a former agent then working for
a legitimate New York arms company who had been telephoned by Yun
regarding an ammunition deal.
   Yun, who owned a trading company called Komex International Corp.
in Summit, conspired to ship 500 quarter-ton bombs to Iran through a
British arms dealer, Charles Caplan.
   ``I think we were outraged by the charge he was targeted because
he was an Oriental. There was a good reason for starting this
investigation,'' said U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr., who called
the sentence fair and appropriate.
   Defense attorney Stephen Dratch promised to appeal the conviction
and sentence.
   Yun showed no reaction when Sarokin announced the sentence, but
family members wept loudly. In the hallway, Yun's elderly mother
fell writhing to the ground. Yun's wife sat throughout with her eyes
closed, as she had during most of the case's proceedings.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark S. Olinsky called the gas the ``most
heinous weapon, or close to it, in the history of mankind.'' He
noted it was developed by the Nazis, who experimented with it on
concentration camp victims.
   The substance is an odorless, colorless poison that enters the
body by inhalation, absorption or injection and causes a painful
death.
   Yun described himself as an honest businessman who emigrated to
this country in 1972 seeking opportunity.
   ``I came to the States for better education, more to enjoy
freedom and justice and to make money more honestly.''

   The father of a black youth slain in an attack by
a white gang was ejected from court after he shouted at a judge who
allowed four of the five defendants to remain free on bail.
   Moses Stewart, father of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins, began yelling
at the judge as he and Hawkins' mother, Diane Hawkins, stood to
leave after Monday's arraignment.
   ``You handkerchief-headed nigger!'' Stewart yelled at Justice
Thaddeus Owens. ``You let murderers walk home free.''
   Owens ordered officers to remove Stewart, who was already on his
way out and muttered, ``letting murderers walk home,'' as the
family's supporters were escorted from the court.
   James Patino, 24; Keith Mondello, 18; Pasquale Raucci, 19; and
Joseph Serrano, 19, were freed on bail after pleading innocent to
murder and other charges in the racial attack that occurred in their
Bensonhurst neighborhood.
   About two hours after the pleas, the fifth defendant and alleged
triggerman, Joseph Fama, 18, pleaded innocent and was ordered back
to jail without bail.
   Hawkins was shot to death Aug. 23 when he and three friends were
surrounded by a gang of about 30 white youths. The black teen-agers
had gone to the mostly white Brooklyn neighborhood in response to an
advertisement for a used car.
   Owens refused a prosecution request, based on a new indictment,
to raise or revoke the $75,000 bail for Serrano and Patino, as well
as a later request from Fama's attorney to set bail at $200,000.
   Fama's attorney, David DePetris, argued that his client had never
before been arrested and denied that Fama was the gunman. Assistant
District Attorney Paul Burns said Fama was identified as the shooter
``by people who have known him all his life.''
   Mondello told police the day after the killing that he saw Fama
shoot the gun, according to a statement released Monday.
   ``I heard one shot from my left,'' Mondello said. ``I looked and
I saw Joey Fama pointing a gun and saw him shoot the gun three more
times. I saw the blue flash at the black. I then saw the black fall
to the ground.''
   Mondello is out on $100,000 bail and Raucci is out on $75,000
bail.
   The prosecutor said he was not legally able to ask for any change
in their bail because the charges against them had not changed.

<DATELINE>SANTA LUCIA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a hit-and-run raid, police rangers
flown in by U.S. helicopters and accompanied by a U.S. adviser blew
up an airstrip used by cocaine smugglers in an eastern jungle.
   Monday's raid was witnessed by the first reporters allowed onto a
new U.S.-built anti-narcotics base in Santa Lucia since it began
operating Sept. 8 beside the Huallaga River in the heart of Peru's
coca-producing region.
   Anti-drug police in four Huey helicopters flown by American
contract pilots swooped in on a 1,500-yard dirt airstrip carved into
the jungle a hundred yards from the Huallaga.
   The rangers quickly set off plastic explosives that left two
craters 20 feet in diameter and 12 feet deep in the runway. Within
10 minutes the helicopters were airborne again.
   ``Speed is the key to safety. We have to come in quickly and get
out quickly,'' said Gen. Juan Zarate, chief of the national
anti-drug police force, who led the group.
   He was referring to the Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, who
dominate the Upper Huallaga valley and provide protection to coca
farmers and drug trafficking gangs in return for cash.
   The four Hueys used in the raid, along with four others on loan
to Peru, are armed with M-60 machine guns and carry gunners at the
door on alert for attack from the jungle.
   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents usually accompany the
police rangers on raids but only one was spotted in Monday's attack
and reporters were not allowed to talk to him.
   The burly agent, dressed in jungle fatigues and carrying an
assault rifle, looked on as police troopers exploded the charges on
the landing strip. He wore a handkerchief over his face to hide his
identity while photos were taken.
   The heavily fortified garrison in Santa Lucia is the centerpiece
of the U.S. government's increasingly militarized campaign against
the drug trade in Peru, which produces nearly 70 percent of the
world's coca leaf, the source of cocaine.
   The anti-drug base, 150 miles northeast of the capital Lima,
eventually will contain at least 300 police troopers. They will
receive training and air support from up to 50 Americans, including
DEA agents and contracted pilots.
   President Bush recently announced $261 million for military and
police-action aid to fight cocaine trafficking in Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia. The three countries this year received $57 million.
   After blowing up the airstrip, the airborne rangers continued on
to a cocaine base lab discovered Friday in a bamboo forest near the
village of Ramal de Aspuzana and later dynamited and burned by
police.
   As Zarate showed journalists around the dynamited buildings, he
pointed out destroyed barrels and dryers that he said turned out 660
pouds of cocaine base a week worth $1.2 million.
   Cocaine base, the final refining stage before pure cocaine, and
coca paste, a more elementary stage, are sold to Colombian drug
smugglers who arrive at dozens of airstrips scattered through the
highland jungle of the Huallaga Valley.
   The Colombian cartels turn the paste and base into pure cocaine
and smuggle it to the United States and Europe.
   About 200 police rangers have begun operating out of the Santa
Lucia base and have destroyed seven laboratories in five days,
Zarate said.
   Bulldozers at the base were still working Monday on the airstrip,
now 1,800 yards long but designed to reach 2,500 yards _ big enough
to handle jumbo C-130 cargo planes.
   Guard towers 30 feet high provide a view out over the river and
the jungle, which has been cut back hundreds of yards from the
perimeter of the base.
   Six-foot-high sandbag barricades protect four helicopter pads.
The base, not including the airstrip, covers 100 acres and is closed
in by barbed wire. The outlying area is mined.
   ``The Shining Path is going to lose hundreds of men if it tries
to attack this base,'' said a U.S. official involved in the war
against the cocaine trade.

<HEAD>Beach Boy's Wilson Sues for Rights to Songs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Beach Boy's founder Brian Wilson filed a $100
million civil suit to recover copyrights to songs that his father
sold to A&amp;M Records and an affiliate for $700,000 in 1969.
   The Superior Court suit Monday charges Irving Music and A&amp;M with
fraud and Wilson's former attorneys, Mitchell, Silberberg &amp; Knupp of
Los Angeles, with legal malpractice in connection with the sale.
   It seeks more than $50 million in compensatory damages _ the
amount Wilson alleged A&amp;M earned in publishing royalties from the
songs he authored and recorded with the Beach Boys _ and $50 million
in punitive damages, said Wilson's attorney, James P. Tierney.
   ``Brian Wilson was an established writer in 1962 at the age of
19,'' Tierney said. ``A performer who has hit songs does not
transfer all publishing rights to his future songs to a publishing
company for no consideration.''
   The suit covers publishing rights to up to 200 songs recorded by
the Beach Boys before 1969, Tierney said, among them ``Surfin'
USA,'' ``Help Me Rhonda,'' ``Good Vibrations'' and ``California
Girls.''
   A spokeswoman at A&amp;M said Monday the firm and its affiliate would
have no comment on the suit. Attorneys at Mitchell, Silberberg &amp;
Knupp could not be reached for comment in repeated telephone calls
to their offices.
   The suit contends that
   Wilson was unable to assert his rights to the songs because of
his drug and alcohol abuse and psychological illness, the suit
claims. The diagnosis of paranoid psychosis that still affects the
singer stemmed from childhood abuse by his father, Murry Wilson,
Tierney said.
   Murry Wilson sold the songs because he was upset over his firing
as the band's manager in 1964, Tierney said in an interview. Brian
Wilson's attorneys, aware of their client's condition, never advised
him of his right to assert ownership to the songs, Tierney said.
   In 1962, the year he formed the Beach Boys, Wilson verbally
agreed to allow his father, Murry Wilson, administrative control of
his songs, with Brian retaining 100 percent ownership, Tierney said.
   Murry Wilson set up Sea of Tunes Publishing Co. to administer the
songs. In 1969, upset over his firing as the band's manager five
years earlier, Murry Wilson sold his son's publishing rights to the
songs to Irving Music for $700,000, Tierney said.
   ``Brian never saw a penny of it,'' he said.
   Murry Wilson died in 1973.

<TEXT>
   Two anti-gun organizations sought
grassroots support for stricter gun laws as the death toll from a
shooting rampage at a printing plant rose to nine.
   Kenneth Fentress, 45, died Monday afternoon, said a spokeswoman
at Humana Hospital University. Fentress suffered gunshot wounds to
the chest and leg during last Thursday's rampage.
   The plant worker was one of 13 wounded when Joseph T. Wesbecker
sprayed the Standard Gravure Corp. with gunfire from an AK-47 rifle.
Wesbecker, who then killed himself, had been on permanent disability
leave from the plant for the past year because of mental illness.
   In a full-page ad Monday in The Courier-Journal, the Louisville
Council on Peacemaking and Religion called for the abolition of
assault weapons, saying it felt ``compelled to say enough is
enough.''
   The group said that society shares part of the blame for allowing
the assault weapons to be sold legally.
   ``The blame can no longer be placed solely on the psychologically
disturbed individuals who find ways to acquire these deadly weapons
and who use them with such abandon,'' the ad said. ``The accomplice
to the crime is the legality of their acquisition.''
   Pat McCuen, co-director of the council, said the ad was an
exercise in grassroots democracy.
   ``Most peole are starting to feel like they're under siege. The
United States is starting to look like a war zone.''
   Also Monday, Handgun Control Inc. placed a three-quarters page ad
in the Louisville newspaper featuring Sarah Brady, wife of former
presidential press secretary James Brady, who was injured in the
attempted assassination of President Reagan in 1981.
   The ad sought contributions to finance lobbying efforts for
``sensible, effective gun laws.''
   ``This is your chance to break the gun lobby's death grip on
Congress,'' Mrs. Brady said in the ad. ``Together, we can beat the
National Rifle Association ... and keep handguns out of the wrong
hands.''
   William Smith, NRA representative of the Kentucky League of
Sportsmen, said legislation to ban weapons would not prevent similar
attacks.
   ``You can't legislate against a nut,'' he said.
   The gun shop owner in Louisville who sold Wesbecker the AK-47 and
a MAC-11 pistol said he had decided to quit special ordering the
semiautomatic weapons for customers.
   ``The weapons are so controversial right now that we just don't
want to fool with them any longer,'' said Jack Tilford, owner of
Tilford's Gun Sales.

   The dollar was mixed in quiet, early European
trading today as market participants held off taking new positions
ahead of new U.S. economic data scheduled for release later in the

   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said the release of the U.S. Consumer
Price Index for August at 8:30 a.m. EDT, expected to show a slight
rise in inflation, has slowed the trading session.
   Dealers are also looking ahead to Thursday's council meeting of
the West German central bank, and to the weekend meeting of the
Group of Seven industrialized nations.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.70 yen to a closing 145.73 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 145.95 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.9539 West German marks, up from 1.9525

   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $361.30 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $361.65. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $360.65.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $360.70, down from $361.00 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 86 cents to close at a bid

   Hurricane Hugo headed toward the Bahamas today after its
devasting 125 mph winds pummeled Puerto Rico, leaving tens of
thousands homeless.
   Hurricane warnings were in effect for the southern Bahamas, as
Hugo packed winds of up to 110 mph early today.
   The region's worst storm in a decade skirted Puerto Rico's
northern coast on Monday and moved northwest.
   Forecasters said sophisticated computer projections showed Hugo
turning toward the west _ and the U.S. mainland. They urged people
along the East Coast from Florida to Virginia to keep track of the
hurricane.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms and heavy rains drenched northern
California for a third day, threatening the grape harvest in the
region's wine country. On Monday, more than 2 inches of rain fell at
Red Bluff, while an inch and a half fell at Navion.
   A snow advisory was in effect this morning for elevations above
7,000 feet along the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevadas of
California. Up to 6 inches of snow was possible.
   In western Nebraska, thunderstorms produced small hail and
locally heavy rain. Showers also were scattered over southern
Wyoming into northern Utah.
   Showers and thunderstorms also fell along the East Coast, from
northeastern Florida to the mid-Atlantic states. Some drizzle fell
over the Northeast.
   Record high temperatures for the date Monday were reported in
International Falls, Minn., with 83 degrees, and Miami, 95 degrees.
   The high for the nation on Monday was 99 degrees at Coolidge,
Ariz.
   Today's forecast called for widespread rain and isolated
thunderstorms from central and southern California through the
central Plateau and the central Rockies to western South Dakota; and
scattered showers and thunderstorms from Florida across the southern
and middle Atlantic coast into southern New England.
   Highs were expected in the 70s or 80s across much of the nation;
in the 60s from the Pacific Northwest across the northern Rockies
into northern North Dakota, the Great Basin and much of New England;
into the low to mid 90s across eastern and southern Texas, the
southern half of the Florida peninsula and over the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 29
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 80 degrees at Key West, Fla.,
and Phoenix.

<TEXT>
   The national assembly has repealed a
1983 law that allowed courts to order public flogging as part of the
sentence for certain crimes, the Mozambican news agency reported
today.
   The law, repealed Monday on a unanimous vote, had allowed judges
to impose flogging, in addition to prison sentences, in cases
involving security offenses, black marketeering, armed robbery and
the rape of minors.
   International human rights groups had criticized the law and
Mozambican authorities reported cases where policemen improperly
carried out floggings on their own, without any court proceedings.

   Tropical Storm Iris and its 60 mph winds swirled in
the Atlantic as Hurricane Hugo devasted the eastern Caribbean.
   Iris' further strengthening was unlikely through this evening,
according to hurricane specialist Gil Clark of the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Even so, the governments of Barbados, St. Vincent and St. Lucia
issued warnings for Iris, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic
hurricane season, which ends in November. Forecasters warned
residents of the Leeward Islands, raked by Hugo, to keep an eye on
Iris.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, Iris' center was near 18.7 north latitude
and 57.9 west longitude, or about 265 miles east of the Leeward
Islands. It was moving north-northwest at about 17 mph.
   The storm was expected to hold that course at a slightly slower
pace today.
   Tropical depressions become named storms when their top sustained
winds reach 39 mph. Iris became a storm Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Small metal fatigue cracks
found in the rear wing joints of more than a third of the Air
Force's aging C-141 transport planes have sent the fleet in for
inspections and repairs.
   It is the second time in two years that wing cracks forced the
Air Force to restrict flights of its workhorse ``Starlifters,''
which are repaired at Robins Air Force Base.
   The cracks were discovered by Robins inspectors last month and
led the Military Airlift Command to order checks of its 266 C-141s,
some of which are delivering military supplies to Colombia for the
push against drug kingpins.
   All of the C-141s are more than 22 years old.
   As of Monday, cracks had been discovered on 79 of 204 planes
inspected, said Capt. Tom Dolney, a spokesman for MAC headquarters
at Scott Air Force Base near Belleville, Ill.
   Sixty-four of the planes have been repaired and returned to
service.
   Dolney said the restrictions have not affected operations.
   Military Airlift Command also flies C-5 and C-130 transport
planes.
   The cracks range in length from one-eighth of an inch to 1{
inches. They have been found on rear wing joints that connect the
inner and outer portions of the plane's 159-foot wings.
   ``Cracks were predicted to occur in this area. However, they were
discovered sooner than anticipated,'' said Robins spokesman Dale
Brinkman.
   Last year the Air Force grounded and inspected its Starlifter
fleet because of extensive corrosion and cracks in center wing
structures.
   The plane was originally designed by the Lockheed Georgia Co. for
a lifetime of 30,000 flying hours. Most already have flown more than
29,000 hours.

<TEXT>
   A former nursing home aide charged
with smothering five patients often joked about having committed
murder, her former lover testified.
   Heather Baragar testified Monday in the trial of Gwendolyn
Graham, who is charged with five counts of first-degree murder and
one count of conspiracy to murder for allegedly suffocating five
severely incapacitated patients at Alpine Manor Nursing Home in
Walker.
   Baragar, also a former nurse's aide at Alpine Manor, testified
that she and Graham became lovers around the time the alleged
slayings began in January 1987. Their relationship continued until
December 1988, when Graham was arrested, she said.
   When the 26-year-old Graham first told her she had killed six
patients at the nursing home, Baragar said she didn't believe it and
``just let it go.''
   But Graham then began telling other friends, Baragar testified.
   ``She joked around about it,'' Baragar said. ``She'd say, `I
killed six people.'''
   Graham was visibly shaken during Baragar's testimony, dabbing her
eyes with a tissue.
   Baragar said Graham admitted smothering the patients with a
pillow while her live-in lover, former nurse's aide Catherine Wood,
stood guard outside the door.
   After Baragar and Graham moved to Tyler, Texas, in July 1987,
Graham heard that an autopsy was being conducted on one of the
alleged victims, Baragar said.
   ``She wanted to know if it was true and if it was true, she
wasn't going to take the whole blame for (the slaying),'' Baragar
said. ``Cathy was part of it.''
   In other testimony, Ms. Wood's ex-husband, Ken Wood, testified
that she confessed to him shortly after Baragar and Graham moved to
Texas. The Woods separated in 1986 and divorced the following year.
   ``She said, `You wouldn't believe some of the things we've
done,''' Wood testified. ``She said that they had killed six people
at Alpine Manor.''
   The patients' deaths were ruled natural until Wood told police of
his ex-wife's confession in October 1988, about 14 months after
their conversation. Ms. Wood has pleaded guilty to one count of
second-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to murder. In
exchange for her testimony against Graham, two counts of
first-degree murder were dropped. She has yet to be sentenced.
   Outside court, Wood told reporters he waited before going to
police because he had promised his ex-wife he wouldn't tell anyone.
   ``I thought about the families of the victims; so many people
were going to get hurt,'' Wood said. ``But Cathy wasn't getting any
better. I sensed a lot of guilt. She couldn't let go of what had
happened. ... I went to police because she needed help.''
   The prosecution was expected to rest today, after which Graham is
expected to testify in her own behalf. If convicted, Graham faces a
mandatory life prison term without parole.

<HEAD>Roof Collapse Injures Kids at YMCA Pool</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A section of roof over a YMCA swimming pool
collapsed on a preschool swimming class while horrified parents
watched, and seven children and a lifeguard were injured.
   Authorities said they didn't know what caused chunks of concrete,
tar and roofing stone to cascade into the pool Monday.
   ``We were looking through a picture window down the other end,
and then the whole roof over the shallow end just came down in one
piece,'' said John Welch, whose son, Michael, was not injured in the
accident.
   The collapse left a jagged 20-by-15 foot hole in the roof of the
brick building.
   Lifeguard David Bortolotto, 18, who was hit in the head by a
piece of debris, and Ellenmarie Joyce, the aquatic programs
director, rushed to rescue the children, aged 3 to 6, from the pool.
   Police Superintendent Gerard McHale called Bortolotto ``a real
superstar. He collapsed after he got the kids out.''
   Bortolotto and swimming student Tracey Blasenheim, 4, were the
most seriously injured. Bortolotto was in stable condition and
Blasenheim was in serious condition with a depressed skull fracture
and abdominal injuries.
   Stuart E. Robbins, the West Roxbury YMCA treasurer, said moisture
and humidity in the pool area may have weakened the concrete roof
decking and possibly led to the collapse.
   He said the roof was inspected in 1984 and 1987. Another section
of the building was inspected this summer after rainwater was found
to be leaking from the ceiling into an office.

   A woman who was stabbed a half-inch from her

assailant in the back, police said.
   The attacker got away, said police, who checked with hospitals to
see if he sought treatment.
   Tammis K. Groft, 37, was in critical condition this morning at
Albany Medical Center Hospital. She was stabbed Sunday night in her
house in Albany's fashionable Center Square neighborhood.
   Police said the attacker had to climb a series of fences, some as
high as 12 feet, to reach the window he used to enter the house.
   Groft is the curator of the Albany Museum of History and Art and
is married to David P. Quinn, stepson of financial columnist Jane

<HEAD>Former Indian Prime Minister Denies He Was CIA Informant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge said Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist
Seymour Hersh does not have to reveal his sources for now for a book
that said former Indian Prime Minister Moraji Desai was a paid CIA
informant.
   The jury Monday watched a videotape of Desai, who has sued Hersh
for libel, in which he denied knowing any CIA agents.
   The deposition was taped during visits by Desai to Chicago in
1984 and 1985. Desai, 94, was too ill to travel from India to
Chicago to testify, said his lawyer, Cyriac Kappil.
   Desai filed a lawsuit almost six years ago seeking $100 million
in damages against Hersh, claiming that he was libeled in the
journalist's 1983 book, ``The Price of Power,'' about former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. In one of the book's chapters,
Hersh wrote that Desai had served as a paid informant for the CIA.
   The lawsuit was filed in Chicago in accordance with the tradition
of filing defamation actions in the hometown of the defendant. Hersh
was born in Chicago, but now lives in Washington, D.C.
   Hersh was expected to be called to testify later this week.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Norgle denied a motion by Kappil to
force Hersh to reveal the unnamed sources he cited in the book. But
he said there may come a time in the trial when it might be
necessary to disclose the names of the sources.
   In his opening statement, Kappil said Hersh's book implied that
Desai was ``a traitor to his government'' and contained false
statements.
   ``He wrote a book to sell,'' Kappil said. ``As is sometimes the
case, to sell a book, they like to put a little curry ... a little
flavor'' in it.
   Bernard Nussbaum, an attorney for Hersh, said the author had six
independent sources who claimed Desai, a bitter enemy of former
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, received $20,000 a year as a CIA
informant.
   The lawyer said the Indian politician cooperated with the CIA
because he was opposed to Ms. Gandhi's close relations with the
Soviet Union and her preparations for the 1971 war with Pakistan.
   ``He tended to oppose whatever she wanted,'' Nussbaum said.
``Here were two bare-knuckled Indian politicians who make Chicago
look like a rose garden.''
   Desai served as prime minister from 1977-80 after his Janata
coalition swept Ms. Gandhi's New Congress Party from power.
   In U.S. libel cases involving a public figure, the plaintiff must
prove that the defendant knew that what he was printing was false,
negligent or malicious.
   Hersh won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1970
for his articles exposing the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, when he
was a reporter for the Dispatch News Service. He was also a reporter
for The Associated Press and for The New York Times before leaving
the newspaper to pursue his own writing projects.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city held its first district-only primary
elections today after officials approved a settlement in a voters'
rights lawsuit.
   The city council decision Monday evening ended a year-long legal
battle and negotiations with lawyers representing black and Hispanic
voters in the federal class-action suit.
   ``At last we've resolved it,'' Mayor Maureen O'Connor said. ``I
think it is a fair compromise, and I am pleased the election will
proceed. I hope everybody goes out and votes.''
   Voters approved district-only elections last year. Today's
primary in four of the city's eight council districts is the first
election since then.
   The lawsuit contended the voting power of minorities in San Diego
was diluted unconstitutionally by a city-wide council election
system.
   Terms of the settlement require June 1990 ballot initiatives on
redistricting the city and on increasing the size of council from
eight to 10 seats.
   ``This increases the opportunity for minorities to elect who they
want to elect, and it increases the opportunity for minorities to
get elected,'' said Jess Haro of the Chicano Federation, which filed
the lawsuit.

<HEAD>Japan To Reduce South Pacific Driftnet Fleet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan has notified countries in the South Pacific
that it will cut driftnet fishing fleets to one-third of last year's
record level in the tuna-rich area, officials said today.
   Fifteen countries in the South Pacific Forum demanded in July
that Japan and Taiwan entirely ban fishing with the enormous nets,
calling it ``indiscriminate, irresponsible and destructive.''
   Japan said then it would continue to permit driftnet fishing for
two years while researching its effect on fish stocks, which
fisheries experts in the region said could be depleted within two
years. Taiwan has not responded to the demands to end driftnet
fishing in the South Pacific.
   Today, Japan's Foreign Ministry said the Fishery Agency notified
Southern Pacific countries including Australia, New Zealand and Fiji
that Japan is to reduce the number of driftnet vessels in the season
starting in November to a maximum of 20 per year, the level before
the number shot up to about 60 driftnetters.
   Fishing with driftnets, which are also called gillnets, is
strongly disputed in the North Pacific as well.
   The United States has negotiated with Japan, South Korea and
Taiwan to limit and monitor use of the long nets which
environmentalists call ``walls of death'' because they snare all
kinds of marine life.
   Driftnet fishing uses nets up to 50 miles long. It has been
condemned as strip mining of the seas and blamed for the destruction
of sea mammals, birds and fish other than the target, southern
albacore tuna.
   The United States has complained that driftnet fishing in
unauthorized North Pacific waters was hurting salmon runs in Alaska,
Washington state and Oregon.
   During the 1988-89 fishing year, the 60 Japanese driftnet vessels
in the South Pacific caught some 10,000 tons of tuna, said a Foreign
Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In comparison, Australia caught just 200 to 400 tons by
pole-and-line fishing, New Zealand 5,200 tons by trawling, and the
United States fetched 3,700 tons, the official added.
   Kentaro Iwasa, spokesman for an association of pole-and-line tuna
fishers, said the government's decision should be a step toward
eliminating driftnet fishing.
   ``Some of our fishing boats got into trouble when the boat's
propeller got caught in a driftnet where driftnet fishing was
prohibited,'' he said, ``We've been urging driftnet fishers and the
government that hazardous driftnet fishing should be eliminated.''
   Foreign Ministry Spokesman Taizo Watanabe told reporters that
each driftnet vessel will have to report its catch.
   Japan will send a patrol vessel to police Japanese driftnetters
and a research vessel to the Tasman Sea, between Australia and New
Zealand, for biological research, he said. One representative from
the region can participate in the research team as an observer.

   Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a
key figure in the Iran-Contra affair, has been convicted for the
second time since May of driving while intoxicated.
   Secord was sentenced in General District Court on Monday to a
$500 fine, with $250 suspended, and loss of his driver's license for
six months, according to Vienna town prosecutor Kevin Kessler.
   Kessler said Secord failed a field sobriety test after his
vehicle was seen in June approaching, at about 2 miles an hour, an
intersection with a green light and being passed by other vehicles.
   Secord is awaiting trial on a charge of refusing to give a blood
or breath sample, the prosecutor said.
   In the earlier conviction, which is under appeal, Secord was
fined $300 and ordered to join an alcohol safety program.
   Secord, an arms dealer, was the chief operative for former Marine
Lt. Col. Oliver North in the Iran-Contra affair in the diversion of
Iranian arms-sales profits to U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua.

   Two million sterile Medflies have
been set loose with a mission to protect California's fruit crop by
messing up the sex lives of their fertile relatives.
   State officials aboard slowly moving flatbed trucks Monday
released the hot-pink irradiated flies from buckets, beginning the
state's final assault on a small but worrisome infestation here of
the Mediterranean fruit fly, which destroys fruit crops.
   ``We want to flood the area with enough sterile flies so that
there's almost no possibility that two fertile flies will meet and
mate,'' said state entomologist Gary Agosta.
   Twenty-three wild Medflies have been found since Aug. 31. On
Sept. 8, helicopters sprayed Mountain View, Sunnyvale and Los Altos
in northern California. But Medfly maggots inside fruit and in the
ground were not affected by the pesticide.
   The Medflies are flown in, unhatched, every night from a
laboratory in Hawaii and are taken to an insect nursery at NASA's
Ames Research Center here to hatch.
   By the time the Medfly eradiction program ends early next year,
as many as 600 million sterile flies will have been released in a
47-square-mile area.

<TEXT>
   Retiring Surgeon General C. Everett Koop is
urging that the new national AIDS commission try to turn around the
``mean-spiritedness'' some Americans show towards people with AIDS.
   And the outspoken physician suggests that those who act hatefully
toward victims of the incurable disease should be treated in the
same way by society.
   ``You could isolate the mean-spirited people in this country and
if the rest of society could treat them with the same repugnance
that those people treat persons with AIDS, I think that should be
your goal,'' Koop told the commission Monday.
   Koop, who has sought to heighten awareness about AIDS during his
tenure as the nation's top health adviser, also said the government
must find a better way to reach teen-agers who are ignoring AIDS
warnings.
   ``We know that sexual activity is rampant and that people of the
group I'm talking about are not listening to us,'' he said.
   Koop spoke to the National Commission on Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome as it held its first day of testimony from
experts, including researchers, advocates and AIDS patients. The
panel was created by Congress last year to advise the president and
Capitol Hill on AIDS issues.
   The latest figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control
there are 105,990 Americans diagnosed as having AIDS. Of those, 60
percent are homosexual or bisexual males and 20 percent are
intravenous drug users.
   Koop caused an uproar with his October 1986 report on AIDS in
which he advocated sex education for young children. ``I still
believe in that very firmly,'' he told the commission.
   Parents, he said, ``should be joining with and not fighting the
schools in getting this done and getting it done properly.''
   ``I do believe if we taught sexuality in kind, loving,
compassionate, caring ways in a family context that we could raise a
generation of teen-agers to be less sexually active than the ones we
have today,'' he said.
   The panel, which met for the first time last month, will take up
the work of an earlier AIDS commission formed by President Reagan
and chaired by Adm. James Watkins. That panel called for a major
escalation of federal efforts to treat, cure and prevent AIDS and
for legislation to protect victims from discrimination.
   Commission member Belinda Mason, a 30-year-old mother of two who
contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion, said the panel can make
a difference in the lives of people with AIDS.
   ``We all want nothing more and nothing less than what all of you
take for granted today: a place to live, the right to have a job,
decent medical care and to lead their lives without invisible
barriers,'' she said.
   She said she would like to see the commission work for federal
protections against discrimination for people with AIDS and for
policies that get expensive drug treatments to those who need them.
   ``Compassion isn't going to happen because of a report we make or
an edict that somebody in Washington delivers,'' she said. ``It'll
begin in the small towns and quiet country throughout America where
people who live with AIDS and HIV infection are just like us,
because they are us.''

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry says he won't be drawn into
controversy about an obscene gesture he made to hecklers, but a
member of his committee to improve the capital city's image says
``it doesn't bode well.''
   Barry, who says he will run for a fourth term in 1990 despite
reported allegations by former associates that he has used drugs,
was greeted Sunday with boos and obscene hand gestures from some
members of a crowd at an outdoor festival.
   Smiling, the mayor made an obscene finger gesture. The incident
was captured on videotape by a local television station.
   ``I will not be sidetracked or drawn into responding to
insignificant, single incidents that do not affect me or the job the
voters of Washington, D.C., elected me to do,'' Barry said Monday in
a written statement.
   Arthur J. Schultz, a local public relations executive and member
of the mayor's committee to improve the city's image, said Barry's
reaction would be normal for many people, but not for a mayor.
   ``I guess we hope that that (television footage) doesn't make it
nationally. It doesn't bode well,'' Schultz said.
   One mayoral candidate, Sharon Pratt Dixon, called on Barry not to
seek re-election, saying the incident shows he is ``essentially
politically impotent.''
   Barry, whose links to a convicted drug dealer are under federal
investigation, has repeatedly denied ever using drugs.
   Officials said about 275,000 people attended the outdoor festival.

   A landlord whose rooming house was
gutted in a fire that killed eight tenants has been convicted of
criminally negligent homicide for code violations that included a
door locked with a key from the inside.
   Two tenants were found dead at the door in the Jan. 15 blaze in
Yonkers.
   Supreme Court Justice Nicholas Colabella on Monday convicted
Frank Thomas on two counts of criminally negligent homicide and
acquitted the 67-year-old landlord on five others. An eighth count
was dismissed earlier.
   It was believed to be the first time in Westchester County that a
landlord was held liable for a death because of failure to comply
with safety codes. Thomas could receive one and one-third to four
years in prison on each count at sentencing Nov. 2.
   Thomas, who lives in New Rochelle, had been charged with the
eight deaths because of fire code violations that included a missing
fire door and a dead bolt on the front door that required a key from
the inside to unlock.
   He was convicted in the deaths of the two men, ages 52 and 61,
who were found at the locked door of the four-story building.
   Investigators said the fire started in the basement and was
caused by careless smoking by a drunken resident. The resident died
in the blaze.
   Defense attorney Neal Comer said the lack of case law on landlord
liability made an appeal ``absolutely necessary.''
   Comer had argued that the special lock had been requested by
tenants worried about the drug addicts hanging out on the steps. He
had also noted that several tenants had been drunk and said that
contributed to their inability to get out.
   District Attorney Carl Vergari's office seized records of city
agencies to determine why full inspections had not been done in as
much as a decade.

<HEAD>Judge Says Federal Feather Permit Process Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The permit process imposed on Pueblo
Indians seeking eagle feathers for religious rites is
unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled.
   The process ``constitutes excessive entanglement with the
religious tenets of those tribes and is therefore an invalid mixture
of church and state,'' U.S. District Judge John Conway ruled Friday.
   Eagle feathers are available to Pueblos only by applying to a
depository maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Conway's ruling came in the case of Mark Suazo Hinds, a Pueblo
charged in the purchase of a golden eagle for $500 that he resold to
a cousin. The case stems from a Fish and Wildlife Service sting that
netted hundreds of arrests in Colorado and New Mexico in January.
   ``The most significant thing to me in the opinion is that this
court has recognized that Indian religious practices are entitled to
just as much protection as anybody else's religion,'' said defense
attorney John Boyd.
   U.S. Attorney Bill Lutz said he is unsure whether he will appeal.
But he said, ``There's no question that the transfer of the eagle
was for money, and we don't think Indian religious freedom was an
issue.''
   Hinds says he sold the eagle at no profit to his cousin, who
needed it after he was to be initiated into a pueblo religious
society. The cousin tried for two years to get an eagle through the
federal depository, the defense argued.
   The prosecution contended that Hinds bought the eagle to make a
fetish for a non-Indian psychiatrist for several thousand dollars.
   But the judge ruled that the prosecution failed to establish any
motive other than religious convictions.
   The judge also noted that Pueblos whose applications are granted
get frozen eagles that often are killed by non-Indians in an
unspecified manner. Some Indian rituals forbid use of a dead eagle;
others designate how the eagle should be killed, he said.
   Alfonso Ortiz, a Pueblo anthropologist, testified at a hearing
that Pueblo religion would ``wither away'' without eagle feathers
but that the plumes are available only through a cumbersome and
intrusive process.
   ``The federal depository has a special problem because one may
apply, but one never knows when or even if you'll get the feathers
you need,'' he said. ``It's very sad that Pueblo peoples who still
practice their traditional religion have to rely on such a system.''

   Hundreds of students staged anti-U.S.
protests in the capital and in the southern city of Kwangju today as
Vice President Dan Quayle arrived for talks expected to cover human
rights and democratic reform.
   A clash also was reported near the U.S. Embassy in Manila between
police and leftist students protesting Quayle's planned visit to the
Philippines. Police fired pistols in the air to scatter the
students, who then withdrew to a nearby park. No arrests were report.
   In Seoul, hundreds of riot police lined the route taken by
Quayle's heavily-guarded motorcade as he went from a military
airport outside to Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon's office at the
start of two days of talks.
   Radical students opposing Quayle's visit staged a small protest
at Seoul Municipal Polytech University, where about 100 students
burned a U.S. flag and chanted ``We oppose Quayle's visit to the
death.''
   At Kyunghee University in eastern Seoul, 50 students burned a
U.S. flag and an effigy of Quayle. They also shouted slogans against
newly assigned U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg, describing him as a
``CIA master of political manipulation.''
   Protests were reported at two other Seoul campuses, but there was
no confrontation with police.
   About 500 radical students shouting ``Yankee go home!'' battled
riot police with firebombs and rocks in the southern city of
Kwangju, police said.
   The protests were minuscule by South Korean standards and
dissident groups made no effort to organize demonstrations in
protest of Quayle's visit. The radicals are demanding an end to
close ties with Washington and expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops
based in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   South Korean and U.S. officials say the U.S. troops must remain
to ensure North Korea does not attack the south. Washington
intervened on behalf of the south during the 1950-53 Korean War and
has kept troops in the country ever since.
   Quayle and his wife Marilyn were greeted by the prime minister
and top Cabinet ministers on their arrival from Alaska. Two Korean
children presented the Quayles with flowers and the vice president
inspected an honor guard.
   Quayle is to meet President Roh Tae-woo and heads of the main
political parties on Wednesday.
   Quayle is expected to urge the South Korean government to keep
its commitment to bringing in full democratic rule since Roh took
power in February last year. The United States is unhappy about a
recent wave of arrests of opponents of the Seoul government.
   South Korean opposition leaders were to tell Quayle about their
concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation, opposition
party officials said. A National Assembly report released Sunday
said 2,094 people had been detained on political charges since Roh
came to power in February 1988.
   U.S. officials, who would not be named, said Quayle would urge
the Roh government to show greater respect for human rights in view
of the jailings and other government moves to curb opposition.
   Roh, a former general, has helped introduce broad democratic
reforms, but conservative groups within the government are taking a
tougher line. Opposition groups contend the government is backing
off its promise of full democracy.

   A short-order cook was charged with murder after
police found boiled and peeled parts of his girlfriend's body in a
bus terminal storage compartment.
   Daniel Rakowitz, 28, was arrested Monday. The victim, a
26-year-old dancer, was not immediately identified.
   Deputy Chief Ronald Fenrich said the victim's skull and some
bones were discovered Monday. The remains were in a five-gallon
container and mixed with cat box filler, said Sgt. John Clifford, a
police spokesman.
   ``He basically boiled the body and flushed the skin down the
toilet,'' Clifford said.
   Police said they were investigating the possibility of
cannibalism.
   The victim, believed to have been a native of Switzerland, broke
off her relationship with Rakowitz, police said. The woman was
beaten and stabbed and her body was kept in the couple's apartment
for about a week, where it was dismembered, Fenrich said.
   ``The relationship had gone sour and she wanted other people to
occupy the apartment,'' Fenrich said.

   With Hurricane Hugo heading toward the U.S. mainland, cruise
lines emptied their ships of passengers and ``hauled tail'' out of
port. Florida residents jammed the phone lines of insurance
companies for financial protection.
   The eastern Caribbean's strongest storm in 10 years churned
toward the Bahamas today after scouring Puerto Rico with 125 mph
winds, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless.
   Early computer predictions indicated the storm was likely to hit
the East Coast late in the week, and officials told coastal
residents to familiarize themselves with emergency procedures.
   ``Hurricane Hugo has the potential of being the worst storm to
affect the Southeast coast since David hit the Georgia-South
Carolina coast in 1979,'' said John Purvis, director of the
Southeast Regional Climate Center in Columbia, S.C.
   Workers at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
began preparing to roll the space shuttle Atlantis from its launch
pad into a building in case Hugo comes too close.
   In addition, NASA decided to drain the fuel from an Atlas-Centaur
rocket carrying a Navy satellite, postponing the launch from Friday
to at least Sunday.
   Preparations were being made to remove the satellite, but NASA
said today that no decision on moving it or the shuttle would be
made until Wednesday.
   Cruise lines in San Juan, Puerto Rico, quickly unloaded
passengers, changed itineraries and sent passengerless liners out to
sea after Hugo's winds began to rake the island Sunday morning.
   ``We hauled tail and got out of there,'' said Rich Steck, a
spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, which canceled this
week's trip on the Sun Viking and ended last week's tour a day
early, bringing 444 passengers into San Juan on Saturday.
   ``As soon as the people were off, we took out to sea with just
crew on board,'' Steck said in Miami. ``Ships are built to ride in
rough water. Its natural element is the sea. We'll just go as far as
we can get from it and then turn around and face it.''
   Royal Caribbean offered passengers on the canceled trip free
tickets and $200 spending money on a later cruise, Steck said.
   Carnival Cruise Lines diverted the Celebration, which which
normally carries up to 1,800 passengers on weeklong trips through
San Juan, St. Thomas and the eastern Caribbean, toward Jamaica and
Mexico.
   Carnival was watching Hugo's development closely before deciding
whether to divert the Carnivale, which left Miami on Monday with
about 1,000 passengers on a four-day trip to the Bahamas, spokesman
Tim Gallagher said.
   Days before possible hurricane watches or warnings for the Miami
area, some insurance agents already have issued a warning of their
own: It's now too late to get flood insurance protection for Hugo.
   ``If someone comes in and wants to add flood insurance, there's a
five-day waiting period,'' said James Berhardt, a State Farm agent.
   Agents for other companies said the hurricane was fast
approaching the point beyond which they would issue no more
increases in property insurance.
   Independent agent John Handeman of south Miami said once any
hurricane crosses 15 degrees north latitude and 72 degrees west
latitude, he won't sell homeowners increased coverage. Miami is at
about 80 degrees west longitude.
   Early today, Hugo's center already had passed the threshold.
   At 2 a.m. EDT, its center was near 20.7 degrees north latitude
and 67.3 degrees west longitude, moving north northwest at 12 mph.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials were
hoping Hugo would give them enough warning before bringing high
winds to the launch site at Cape Canaveral.
   According to NASA's contingency plan, officials will order a
rollback of the Atlantis if they receive a forecast that
hurricane-force winds will arrive at the cape within 72 hours.
   By Monday night, the National Weather Service estimated there was
only an 8 percent chance that hurricane force winds would hit Cape
Canaveral before Thursday evening.
   But because the shuttle can move at only 1 mph, the journey back
to the assembly building takes six hours, leaving little room for
error.
   NASA said that if caught by high winds it could secure the
shuttle and its cargo, the nuclear-powered Galileo space probe, on
the launch pad to ride out any storm.
   A return to the hangar would certainly mean a delay in the
scheduled Oct. 12 launch of Atlantis, but NASA has until late
November to send the probe on its six-year voyage to the planet
Jupiter.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 100 miners occupied a Pittston Coal
Group control room for a third day today despite a $13.5 million
fine and a court order.
   Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin imposed the fine against the
United Mine Workers on Monday for a variety of violations in July
and August during the strike begun against Pittston in April. He
also barred union members and supporters from impeding Pittston
operations.
   But on the other side of Copper Ridge, UMW members continued to
occupy the control room, where they barricaded themselves Sunday
with padlocks and steel cables.
   State Police made no immediate attempt to remove the
demonstrators _ 98 UMW members and a religious leader who carried
sleeping bags, toilet articles and enough food for about 10 days.
   Union leaders said the takeover would remain peaceful and
promised that no damage would be done to the plant, where coal is
sorted, cleaned and shipped.
   About 1,200 supporters rallied outside Monday, State Police
spokesman Charlie Vaughan said. ``Until something develops, we're
just observing and hoping nothing gets out of hand,'' Vaughan said.
   Pittston's 1,695 UMW employees from Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky are involved in the strike, which has become a cause for
organized labor across the country because the workers believe
Pittston is trying to break the union.
   The UMW now has been fined roughly $22 million by state and
federal judges for illegal demonstrations and acts of violence
against company property and employees.
   Late Monday, the National Labor Relations Board filed court
papers to have the sit-in declared unlawful. A court official said
the NLRB is seeking heavy fines, jail terms and an end to the $200
weekly strike benefits to members.
   A hearing was set for this afternoon in Big Stone Gap.
   The demonstration was designed to persuade Pittston Co. Chairman
Paul Douglas to come to the bargaining table and as a statement
against unfair labor laws, union officials said.
   Negotiations have been stalled for six weeks and no talks are
scheduled.

<HEAD>Bush Not Ready to Set Date for Summit With Gorbachev</HEAD>

comments Monday.</HEAD>

   President Bush, accusing the Soviet Union
of interfering in the Western Hemisphere by sending arms to
Nicaragua, says he's not ready to set a date for a summit meeting
with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``I feel under no rush on that subject,'' Bush told reporters
Monday at a news conference in Helena, Mont., before flying here for
the night.
   The president, on a two-day tour of western states celebrating
their 100th anniversary, also said he was not about to be pressured
on the issue of arms control by reports of a new Soviet proposal.
   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze is expected to meet with
Bush at the White House on Thursday, before Shevardnadze's meeting
beginning the following day in Jackson Hole, Wyo., with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   Bush conceded he had heard, but could not personally confirm,
speculation that Shevardnadze would bring with him a new proposal
for limiting long-range nuclear missiles.
   However, Bush said, ``We're not going to just react to his
proposals. We're going to be very interested and welcome them, but
we just simply cannot and will not keep reacting.''
   Bush denied he was dragging his feet on entering negotiations
with the Soviets on limiting ballistic missiles, although he
conceded this might be the perception because had focused attention
earlier in his administration ``into getting conventional force
stability'' in Europe.
   Asked about a summit with Gorbachev, Bush said he first wanted to
await results of the Baker-Shevardnadze meeting. A superpower summit
is expected to be one issue on the agenda.
   Suggesting that Soviet intentions still leave a lot to be
desired, Bush said: ``We have interests in this hemisphere where the
Soviets are continuing to send ... increased amounts of arms going
into Nicaragua right now over last year. That's not very good.
That's not a very kind and gentle approach to this hemisphere.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said Monday that the Bush
administration has reacted timidly to events in Eastern Europe and
should actively support the forces of democratic change in the
communist world.
   He called on Bush to support the entry of communist nations into
Western economic institutions, ``once their internal reforms merit
such participation.''
   ``Now is the time for the United States to encourage and
capitalize upon the changes we have sought for so long,'' Mitchell
said in a Senate speech. ``The administration's timidity in the face
of these opportunities is puzzling and dismaying. Instead of
encouragement and engagment, the administration has adopted an
almost passive stance.''
   On another issue involving Latin America, Bush said he did not
fear for his safety or for that of his family because of reported
death threats from Colombian drug lords, saying he had confidence in
the Secret Service.
   He said there was ``no hard intelligence evidence'' of the
targeting of his family or of any other Americans by drug interests
in Colombia.
   ``But, clearly, any such action would, I think, just bring down
the total wrath of the American people and the American
government,'' he said.
   On another topic, Bush said he was not ready to restore normal
relations with the People's Republic of China, saying there has been
little apparent change in that government's attitudes since Chinese
troops fired on unarmed demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square
last spring.
   ``It's not a time for total normalcy,'' Bush said.
   His administration announced on Monday it intends to give
most-favored-nation trade status to Hungary. Bush praised Hungary's
communist government at his news conference for allowing thousands
of East Germans to flock across its borders en route to freedom in
West Germany.
   Asked whether he favors the reunification of Germany, Bush said:
``I would think it's a matter for the Germans to decide.''
   But, he added: ``If that (reunification) was worked out between
the Germanys, I do not think we should view that as bad for Western
interests.''
   Bush, returning to Soviet issues, said he was not ready to relax
trade restrictions on the Soviet Union like he is doing for Hungary.
   He said that, despite some reported progress, the Soviet Union
still is not permitting free emigration of Soviet Jews and other
minorities.
   ``I think things are improving, but I think as long as someone is
held in a country against their will because they can't get out, it
is a matter of human concern,'' Bush said.

   Two fishing boats with 37 people aboard collided
in the dark early today and one vessel sank in the Pacific, the
Coast Guard said. Two crewmen were reported injured.
   Two other fishing boats picked up all but four or five of the
victims from lifeboats about 20 miles south of San Diego, said Petty
Officer Charles Cowan. The others remained on board the vessel still
afloat.
   The 50-foot Temptress, carrying 29 people, collided with the
65-foot Aztec, with eight people aboard, shortly before 3 a.m., said
Petty Officer Steven Dickerson.
   The San Diego-based Temptress sank. The Aztec, also based in San
Diego, was to be towed back to port. ``About four or five crew
members are still on board the Aztec and are trying to control the
flooding on board,'' Cowan said.
   One man suffered a separated shoulder and another a broken rib,
said Cowan.
   A Coast Guard cutter, a helicopter and two patrol boats remained
on the scene during the rescue effort, Cowan said.
   The cause of the accident was under investigation.
   Cowan said the weather apparently was not a factor because skies
were partly cloudy with calm seas and winds.

   Employers in San Francisco will soon be

   The Board of Supervisors unanimously adopted an ordinance Monday
night requiring such notices. It will take effect next week after a

   The warnings will be displayed in offices, businesses and other
workplaces. They will contain information such as ``even one line of
cocaine has been known to kill the user'' and ``marijuana can cause
serious psychotic problems.''
   The ordinance contains no enforcement mechanism or penalties for
noncompliance.
   The legislation is similar to state laws that require warnings
about alcohol at places where liquor is sold. The postings will also

   China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping today laughed
about foreign reports of his death and spoke of how his reappearance
in public had helped the Hong Kong stock exchange.
   Deng, 85, also told Japanese lawmaker Masayoshi Ito that among
the politicians he most respected were former President Nixon, Henry
Kissinger and Japan's former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. All three
men led the way in improving their countries' relations with China.
   The meeting at the Great Hall of the People was the second for
China's reclusive leader in three days.
   On Saturday, Deng appeared in public for the first time in three
months when he held talks with Chinese-American physicist T.D. Lee.
   Deng's re-emergence after the long absence has, for the moment,
dispelled speculation that he is gravely ill with cancer and may not
have long to live.
   The nationally televised evening news showed Deng walking unaided
to meet Ito, whom he called ``an old friend'' as the two shook hands.
   Ito, who heads Japan's Parliamentarians League for Japan-China
Friendship, opened the meeting by commenting that Deng appeared to
be in the same good health as when they met a year ago, despite
reports that he was seriously ill.
   Deng replied that the foreign mass media had already declared him
dead or very sick. Such reports caused the Hong Kong stock market to
fall, he said, adding that the market had recovered when he
reappeared Saturday with Lee, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist.
   ``In reality I have always been healthy,'' Deng said.
   Yoshiro Hayashi, a Japanese lawmaker and member of the
delegation, provided details of the meeting to the Japanese press.
   Deng praised the ``high political consciousness'' of Nixon,
Kissinger and Tanaka, who helped bring about the normalization of
relations with China even though China was then in the throes of the
leftist Cultural Revolution.
   Kissinger, then National Security Adviser, made a secret trip to
Beijing in 1971 to set the stage for Nixon's dramatic visit in
February 1972.
   Tanaka, who like Nixon was later to be forced out of office by
scandal, traveled to China in September 1972 to normalize relations
between the two countries.
   Drawing an apparent comparison with the leaders of the West
today, Deng criticized the participants of the recent seven-nation
summit of industrialized nations in Paris for calling on China to
cease its crackdown on those who sought democratic reforms.
   He also said Japan's attitude has been different from that of the
United States, which has been vocal in calling for China to end its
suppression of dissent and ensure the human rights of its citizens.
   Japan, like the United States, has curtailed high-level official
contacts and suspended talks on new loans since the army killed
hundreds of unarmed civilians June 3-4 in clearing central Beijing
of pro-democracy protesters.
   But Japan has also muffled its public criticisms of the Chinese
government's actions.
   Deng stressed the importance of China's relations with its
biggest trading partner outside Hong Kong, and said ties should
continue despite China's recent domestic turmoil.
   Ito, the highest-level Japanese official to visit China since
June, said the June events had put a damper on relations between the
two countries and his mission was to find out how these problems
could be overcome.
   Since arriving Sunday, Ito has also met with Premier Li Peng,
Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin and other top leaders.
He was to return to Japan later today.
   On Saturday, Deng said the crushed pro-democracy movement ``has
taught us a major lesson ... After the turmoil, all of us have
become sober-minded.''
   Deng stressed China's commitment to the market-oriented reforms
he initiated 10 years ago, but added that some officials ``did not
pay enough attention to ideological and political developments.''
   It was an apparent reference to ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang,
who has been accused of encouraging ``bourgeois liberalization,'' or
acceptance of Western liberal ideas, in pushing ahead with rapid
reform without duly considering ideological matters.

   Forecasters today said deadly Hurricane Hugo could
hit anywhere from Florida to North Carolina this weekend _ or spin
harmlessly away in the Atlantic.
   ``It's a long way from any potential landfall,'' said Bob Sheets,
director of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
``Unfortunately, the higher likelihood is that it will turn more
west and could make landfall anywhere from South Florida to North
Carolina.''
   Sheets added, though, that it's also possible the hurricane could
skirt the United States entirely.
   Forecasters today watched data spit out of computers, studied
satellite maps and reconnaissance photos flown back on Air Force
``hurricane hunter'' planes, and even pulled out old hurricane
charts to see what storms similar to Hugo have done.
   The data laid out conflicting futures for Hugo, Sheets said.
   ``We were just looking through a bunch of the old charts,'' he
said. ``They've done everything. They've done loopity-loops, they've
gone into South Florida, they've gone into central Florida, all the
way up to the Carolinas.''
   The main area of agreement on the computer models, Sheets said,
was that Hugo is likely to change from the north-northwest course it
followed overnight after pounding Puerto Rico.
   ``Now the question is when is it going to turn more
west-northwest,'' Sheets said. ``There's just not any way to say.''
   Hurricanes are propelled by prevailing winds generated by other
weather systems.
   The most likely impact on Hugo will be a ``Bermuda High,'' a
high-pressure system building to Hugo's northeast, forecasters said.
That system would tend to keep Hugo from veering from the East Coast.

   The Holy See's Commission for Religious Relations with Judaism
noted with satisfaction the communique published Sept. 6 by His
Excellency Monsignor Henryk Muszynski, president of the Polish
Episcopal Commission for Dialogue with Judaism.
   The intention expressed to proceed to the establishment of an
information center, a center of meeting, dialogue and prayer, as
foreseen in the Geneva agreement of February 1987, is positively
received, because the Holy See is convinced that such a center would
contribute in an important way to the development of good relations
between Christians and Jews.
   The Holy Father, in effect, in his speech to the Jewish community
in Vienna, on June 24, 1988, expressed the hope that ``this center
produce fruitful results and serve as a model for other nations.''
   The prayer and the sacred life of the Carmelites, whose monastery
will be in a certain sense the heart of the center, will contribute
in a decisive way to its success.
   Toward the realization of this important but expensive project,
the Holy See is disposed to offer its financial support.

<HEAD>Woman Recants Rape Charge, Plans to Marry Defendant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEDIA, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors dropped rape charges after a woman
announced in court she plans to marry the man she accused of
attacking her.
   Karen Drake, 25, in June testified she was ``pinned down'' and
raped by Donald Farmer, 31. But on Monday, she said she plans to
marry him Sept. 30.
   Assistant District Attorney Colleen Marsini moved to dismiss the
charges because Ms. Drake would not testify.
   ``She's in love and they're getting married,'' defense attorney
David Breen said. ``She posted bail for him and paid his legal fees.
It's the first time I've ever had a victim pay my fee.''
   While rape and related offenses were withdrawn, Farmer did plead
guilty to stealing a diamond ring from Ms. Drake and received two
years' probation.
   Breen said the woman met Farmer at a tattoo parlor and set up a
dinner date.
   When Farmer arrived at her apartment, her friend gave him a
prescription drug, which she blames for his aggressive behavior,
Breen said.
   ``He's now undergoing drug rehabilitation,'' Breen said.

   Pilots of United Airlines Flight 232 disagreed
over how best to control their crippled airliner seconds before it
crash-landed at an Iowa airport, according to a transcript of
cockpit conversation.
   The transcript shows Capt. Albert Haynes of United Flight 232
called for left turns, right turns and a cut in power within the
final 20 seconds before the DC-10 cartwheeled and exploded in flames
at Sioux City on July 19, killing 112 people.
   But trainer pilot Dennis Fitch told Haynes that closing the
throttles would take away the ability to steer the plane, according
to the transcript released Monday by the National Transportation
Safety Board. A report accompanying the transcript said Fitch
believes he added power ``just prior to contact with the ground.''
   Haynes, Fitch and two other pilots in the cockpit have been
widely praised for bringing the jetliner down with no greater loss
of life after one of its three engines exploded, severing all
hydraulic flight controls.
   The cockpit crew and 180 people survived the crash.
   The transcript shows that just 15 seconds before impact, Haynes
and First Officer William R. Records called for Fitch to ``close
off'' both throttles.
   But Fitch, who had been called into the cockpit from the
passenger section to assist the airliner's three-man crew, replied,
``Nah, I can't pull 'em off or we'll lose it. That's what's turnin'
ya.''
   Fitch had been steering the plane by selectively applying power
to its two wing engines after its tail-mounted third engine
apparently threw out parts that severed hydraulic lines in its tail.
   The DC-10's builder, McDonnell Douglas, last week announced
changes in the design of its planes' hydraulic systems that James B.
Busey, head of the Federal Aviation Administration, said would
ensure similar hydraulic failure would not occur again.
   John M. Martin, inspector for the FAA assisting in the NTSB
investigation, said the plane's remaining two engines were operating
when it hit. He said there were no apparent conflicts in statements
flight crew members made to investigators about the landing, but
acknowledged there was disagreement in the flight's final seconds
over cutting back power.
   Haynes' order to ``close off'' the throttles was to put the
engines in idle, not to shut them down completely, Martin said.
   The cockpit tape, on a loop that records over itself after about
a half-hour, covers only the final 33 minutes and 34 seconds of the
flight. The tape does not include the sound of the engine failure on
the Denver-Chicago flight or pilot conversation over the next 10
minutes.
   The safety board last month released transcripts of the plane's
communication with the ground, but had not previously included
sounds picked up by the cockpit microphone.
   ``Ease the power back,'' Haynes told Fitch a few seconds before
impact.
   ``Maybe you can pull 'em all the way off,'' suggested First
Officer William R. Records.
   Haynes then called for left turns and said, ``Close the
throttles.'' After a few seconds, he called for a right turn and
again said, ``Close the throttles.''
   But Fitch declined.
   The board provided no analysis of the taped conversation, which
will be used in its continuing investigation into the crash.
   A report accompanying the transcript noted there was constant
discussion among crew members on the best course of action to take
during the flight.
   The transcript shows they discussed whether to lower the landing
gear, and later disagreed about when the wheel door was opened.
   At one point the captain said, ``Anybody got any idea about
puttin' the gear down right now?''
   Another crew member, identified tentatively as Fitch, later said,
``Dammit. I wish we hadn't put that gear down.''
   About four minutes before the crash landing, Haynes gave rapid
``back'' and ``forward'' commands and then said, ``Won't this be a
fun landing?''

   The Justice Department said today its criminal
division is reviewing records of the long-running congressional
investigation into influence peddling at the Department of Housing
and Urban Development.
   ``The records of the House subcommittee are being reviewed
closely as a part of the HUD matter,'' said David Runkel, the
department's chief spokesman.
   He said the review began earlier this summer and is being
conducted by the fraud and public integrity sections of the criminal
division.
   Runkel rejected calls from several lawmakers that the Justice
Department seek court appointment of an independent counsel to
investigate allegations of wrongdoing at HUD.
   ``Investigations are proceeding in U.S. attorneys' offices around
the country and there is no reason to believe these cannot be
handled by the U.S. attorneys,'' Runkel said. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh ``has made it clear he wants these cases given high
priority,'' the spokesman added.
   The House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and
housing has heard allegations of influence peddling during the
Reagan administration to obtain high-level approval of HUD financing
for development projects.
   The panel has also heard conflicting testimony about the role of
former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. in the awarding of HUD
grants to politically connected developers.
   Pierce has denied allegations that he helped political friends
get HUD grants. The panel has heard testimony contradicting Pierce's
denials and has called him back for more questioning on the matter.
   The public integrity section earlier had reviewed a HUD inspector
general's report that found broad instances of lobbying of top HUD
officials by developers. The prosecutors made a preliminary
conclusion that the report had uncovered no instances of wrongdoing.
   HUD officials, meanwhile, asked Congress Monday to reverse a
court decision they say could cost the government more than the $2
billion pricetag put on past agency abuses.
   The request came at a Senate Banking Committee hearing at which
deputies to HUD Secretary Jack Kemp also promised to permanently
flush politics out of the selection process for HUD's abuse-riddled
Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program.
   It was the first HUD-related hearing by the Senate panel since
Congress returned earlier this month from a month-long recess.
   Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said the panel planned to call
all of the major players in the Reagan-era abuses at HUD, an
indication the Senate would seek to match an exhaustive
investigation being conducted by a House subcommittee.
   During prior testimony, Kemp agreed with a congressman's $2
billion ``ballpark'' estimate of the cost to taxpayers of the
influnce-peddling, fraud and mismanagement in HUD programs during
the eight-year tenure of Pierce.
   James Logue, the agency's general assistance secretary for
multifamily housing, said a recent decision by the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco could cost HUD $2.5 billion over
the next decade unless Congress amends housing laws.
   The court rejected HUD's formula for granting rent increases to
Section 8 projects, saying the agency cannot use rent-comparability
studies to determine how much owners of subsidized apartments can
raise rents.
   Logue said the ruling would cost HUD $150 million in the circuit
court's nine-state jurisdiction and if applied nationwide could cost
from $600 million to $1 billion in retroactive rent adjustments and
another $1.5 billion over the next 10 years.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said the panel would consider the
request and asked Logue to provide more information on the ruling.
   The moderate rehabilitation program was the subject of a scathing
report earlier this year in which HUD's inspector general said that
lucrative subsidies were awarded to former HUD officials or other
developers who retained prominent Republican consultants.
   Much of the influence peddling was blamed on a 1984 decision to
repeal a ``fair share'' formula through which the subsidies were
awarded to local housing authorities that demonstrated a need for
the low-income housing and the ability to administer the program.
   HUD officials took over most of the funding decisions after
Congress repealed the formula.
   Kemp, however, voluntarily decided to revert to using the ``fair
share'' approach and his deputies said the department would continue
that if the program is funded next year.
   The inspector general also found that many moderate
rehabilitation projects were approved at excessive rents, costing
the government hundreds of millions of dollars over the 15-year
subsidy contracts.
   Logue said about 300 of the projects will be audited in the
beginning of the new fiscal year which begins Oct. 1 and HUD would
move to lower the rent subsidies if they were inappropriately
calculated.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin met today to discuss Rabin's trip to Egypt,
and the government's two main parties appeared locked in a dispute
over Egypt's plan to sponsor Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
   Rabin left Shamir's office without speaking to reporters after an
hour-long meeting. He spent seven hours in Cairo on Monday.
   Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner refused to divulge details of the
meeting, but repeated Shamir's remark Monday that he could not
maintain his governing coalition between his rightist Likud bloc and
the center-left Labor Party ``at any price.''
   Israeli newspapers reported that Labor leaders were negotiating
secretly with smaller religious parties to try to form a governing
coalition if the current coalition falls.
   The controversy centers on Likud's opposition to Mubarak's
proposal for breaking a stalemate in the Middle East peace process.
   Shamir is also concerned about Rabin's remarks at a Cairo news
conference hinting at Israeli recognition of an indirect PLO role in
peace talks, Israeli radio stations reported.
   Israel officially refuses to deal with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which it views as a terror group.
   In those remarks, Rabin said Israel agreed to Egypt arranging an
Israeli-Palestinian meeting. He said Egypt could put together the
Palestinian delegation ``after coordinating with various elements .
.. including Israel.''
   Palestinian leaders interpreted Rabin's remarks as consenting to
Egypt's suggestion that the delegation include Arabs deported by
Israel from the occupied territories.
   That would be a compromise between Israel and the PLO, because
Israel wants to include only Palestinians from the West Bank and
Gaza and the PLO wants Palestinians from outside.
   Shamir did not respond directly today to Rabin's remarks, except
to hint that his fractious governing coalition, put together last
December, was in trouble.
   ``I personally would like to see the coalition remain, but I must
say that unity is not worth any price,'' he said.
   Shamir also is under heavy pressure from Likud hard-liners who
oppose Egypt's plan because it urges Israel to accept the principle
of trading territory for peace.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens tried to play down the crisis today.
``We have coalition crises here an average of about once a month, so
we need another crisis today,'' Arens said.
   Two peace plans were discussed at the Cairo meeting, Rabin and
Mubarak said in separate news conferences Monday.
   According to Israel's plan, approved by the government in May,
1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip would elect
delegates to negotiate with Israel on an interim autonomy solution,
with the final status of the territories to be decided later.
   Mubarak's plan is more specific. It calls for Israel to trade
land for peace and requires that the building of Jewish settlements
be halted in the occupied lands, which Israel seized in the 1967
Middle East war.
   Labor supports Mubarak's 10-point memorandum as way of breaking
the impasse in the peace process, and it is inclined to agree to
talk with the deportees or with compromise candidates such as one
defined by Rabin as ``a (Palestinian) professor from the United
States.''
   Mubarak said he will conduct the next round of peace talks in New
York, where he is to meet with Labor leader Shimon Peres and also
with Arens.
   The Israeli Cabinet will discuss the Egyptian initiative in two
to three weeks, when both ministers return to the country, Rabin
said.

   The FBI, tipped off by TV viewers,
sent a blank sheet of paper by certified mail to catch a man
suspected of staging his death in a 1982 boat explosion to collect
more than $500,000 in life insurance.
   Allen ``Buck'' Jones, 34, featured last month on the program
``America's Most Wanted,'' was arrested Monday.
   Postal workers in Dania had reported to the FBI that Jones
resembled a man named Mark Spencer who leased a postal box there. On
Monday, postal workers notified Spencer that he had received an
envelope via certified mail.
   The envelope was an FBI ploy.
   Although postal workers attempted to stall him, Jones left before
the FBI arrived. But sheriff's deputies spotted his van and arrested
him.
   Inside the van, deputies found an automatic weapon, a silencer,
$40,000 in cash, a $40,000 cashier's check and marijuana, said
sheriff's spokesman George Crolius.
   Jones and his father are accused of trying to collect insurance
from his ``death'' in South Carolina, which until May was thought to
have been real.
   The mystery began when Jones' boat exploded on Lake Murray near
Columbia, S.C., one day before Jones was to stand trial on burglary
charges. Rescue workers found no body and Jones was declared dead
after the accident.
   In May, however, an informant told investigators that Jones was
living in Florida under the alias Mark Allen Spencer, the FBI said.
   Jones' father, Charles M. Jones Jr., is in custody and is
scheduled to stand trial later this month.

   The Vatican said today that a Roman Catholic
convent of Carmelite nuns near the Auschwitz death camp in Poland
should be moved to another site, as Jewish groups have sought.
   Breaking its silence on an issue that has severely strained
Jewish-Catholic relations, the Vatican said it would help to pay for
a prayer center in which the nuns would live.
   Jewish leaders in the United States applauded the statement and
said it would improve Jewish-Catholic relations.
   A February 1987 accord between Jewish and Roman Catholic
representatives stipulated that the nuns would be moved to the
prayer center from a convent just outside Auschwitz. Jews have
objected to their presence at a site where 2.5 million Jews were
murdered by the Nazis during World War II.
   However, the Polish primate, Cardinal Josef Glemp, has called for
renegotiating the agreement and said the Polish church did not have
the money to build a new home for the nuns.
   The agreement, signed in Geneva, called for the nuns to have been
moved by Feb. 22, but the deadline passed and the nuns remained.
   Glemp, on a 24-hour visit to Bristol, England, to consecrate a
Polish Catholic church, indicated he had not read the Vatican
statement.
   Based on what reporters had told him about the statement, he
said: ``this would seem to be a forceful resolution of the problem
and I don't think that would be a very positive way of resolving
it.''
   But Glemp also said ``there is a possibility that the nuns could
move elsewhere.''
   ``But if they were to be moved, this should be done with charity
because even if we were to transfer these nuns to a different
location, that would also be crossing out their rights,'' he said.
   The archbishop of Krakow, Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, said
last month that the church was abrogating the agreement since it
could not be fulfilled in an atmosphere of aggressive demands.
   The Vatican's Commission for Religious Relations with Judaism
said in a communique today that it was pleased with a declaration
from Poland's bishops earlier this month that Roman Catholics and
Jewish groups should resume talks on building a prayer center in
which the nuns would live.
   ``The Holy See is convinced that such a center would contribute
in an important way to development of good relations between
Christians and Jews,'' the communique said.
   The Rev. Pier Francesco Fumagalli, secretary of the commission,
told reporters he expected the Geneva declaration would be honored.
But he added ``I can't forsee what will happen in Poland.''
   He said the questions of exactly where, when and how the prayer
center would be built were being left to Polish church officials.
   Asked whether the pope had approved the communique, a Vatican
spokesman, the Rev. Giovanni D'Ercole, noted the statement had been
published in the official Vatican bulletin _ implying papal
acceptance.
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
said that because of the Vatican communique, his organization had
decided to recommend to its constituencies around the world that
they suspend their freeze on contacts with the Vatican.
   ``We welcome this very important step in restoring the good word
of the church. It's time to move on and implement the agreement,''
he said.
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Simon Weisenthal Center in Los
Angeles, said the communique was a major policy reversal by the
Vatican that would remove a stumbling block in Catholic-Jewish
relations.
   ``The issue was never over the rights of non-Jews to pray at
Auschwitz,'' Hier said. ``The issue was the building of permanent
structures at Auschwitz.''
   An estimated 2.5 million of the 4 million victims of
Auschwitz-Birkenau were Jewish, and the convent's opponents argue
that it is deeply offensive that Christian religious symbols tower
over what is in effect their gravesite.
   Glemp has called the Geneva accord ``offensive,'' and he provoked
further controversy with remarks deemed by many to be anti-Semitic.
   An estimated 1.5 million Christians also were killed at Auschwitz.
   The proposal to remove the convent founded in 1984 just outside
the Auschwitz fence has found little sympathy among Poles. They
argue that the nuns are not harming anyone and that thousands of the
victims at Auschwitz were Polish political prisoners, including many
priests and nuns.
   The issue has also caused divisions among cardinals.
   Last weekend, Cardinal John J. O'Connor, archbishop of New York,
said he supported Jewish efforts to move the nuns and that he was
exploring talking to Pope John Paul II about the dispute.
   Jewish groups have asked the Polish-born pope to step in and
settle the controversy. But until today's announcement, the pope had
left it up to the Polish church to settle.

<HEAD>South Africa Bans Video Featuring Exotic Male Dancers From U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A film company said Tuesday
that government censors have banned a video of the Chippendales, a
troupe of male exotic dancers from the United States who are drawing
capacity crowds at a resort in a black homeland.
   Videovision Enterprises said in a statement that censors declared
the video ``lust-provoking'' and ``offensive.''
   The company said it had acquired rights to distribute the video,
entitled ``Tall, Dark and Handsome,'' because of the Chippendales'
current box-office success at Sun City, a sports-and-gambling resort
in the tribal homeland of Bophuthatswana.
   The South African censors' rulings have no authority in
Bophuthatswana and three other nominally independent homelands.
   Hazel Feldman, entertainment director at Sun City, said she was
surprised by the censors' decision.
   ``There is nothing salacious about the Chippendales' show,'' she
said. ``It is good, clean, wholesome fun.''
   Sun City regularly offers nude revues featuring female dancers.
The Chippendales are the first all-male troupe to perform a
comparable revue, and have been playing to sold-out houses.

   Five sweltering days pinned inside a box
spring on a moving truck turned the once-standoffish Pippen the cat
into a cuddly pet.
   The calico owned by Sandy Zywica and her husband, Richard, was
found with her paws stuck in the springs after the couple's
belongings arrived from their Kenosha, Wis., home at new digs in
Severna Park.
   The cat had been missed, but checks of her favorite spots failed
to turn her up. She was pulled from the truck Aug. 22 to the claps
of moving men.
   ``She's very standoffish and that's what got her into trouble,''
Mrs. Zywica said. ``She just never was a friendly cat.''
   But that was before Pippen's ordeal, which left her tired but
healthy after a brief recovery. Now, she cuddles and rubs against
her owners.
   ``She would have never done this before,'' Mrs. Zywica said.

<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For thousands of Neapolitans who gathered at
the cathedral on Tuesday the news could not have been better. The
dried blood of the city's patron saint, St. Januarius, liquified
right on schedule.
   The city's archbishop, Cardinal Michele Giordano, announced the
``miracle'' to 5,000 people after the faithful had prayed for only
eight minutes.
   The blood of the saint, who was beheaded for his faith in A.D.
305, almost always turns to liquid on Sept. 19, the day marking his
death, and two other days during the year.
   Last year, the liquification took 34 minutes after prayers began.
   Superstition has it that bad luck or disaster will follow if the
dried blood does not liquify. The Vatican has not classified the
liquification as a miracle and generally disapproves of the way it
is linked to misfortune.
   Italian scientists have theorized that the contents of the vial
holding the dried blood liquifies from the warmth of the hands
holding it.

   The jury at Jim Bakker's fraud trial today
watched a videotape in which the TV evangelist pleaded for millions
in donations while assuring followers, ``I would not lie to you
about anything.''
   Prosecutors on Monday began showing the eight-hour tape culled
from broadcasts of Bakker's ``The PTL Show.''
   On the tape, Bakker asked followers to send $1,000 in exchange
for ``lifetime partnerships'' guaranteeing three nights' lodging a
year for life at PTL's Heritage USA theme park.
   A segment played today had Bakker encouraging viewers to use
their credit cards to buy a partnership.
   ``I'm sincere, I would not lie to you about anything,'' Bakker
told viewers in 1984. He explained that he paid for his own
partnership by credit card because he did not have the cash.
   ``Mr. IRS got to me first, Uncle Sam just took everything we
could scrape together,'' he said.
   On Monday, actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr. testified that the PTL board
of directors, on which he once served, was little more than a rubber
stamp for Bakker.
   Bakker is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million in PTL
money raised from the partnerships so that he could live in style.
If convicted on all 24 counts, Bakker could be sentenced to 120
years in prison and fined more than $5 million.
   Witnesses have testified they bought the partnerships but could
not get rooms. Others testified that partnerships were oversold and
that the money often was used to cover PTL's day-to-day operating
costs rather than finance construction of the guaranteed rooms.
   
   
   FBI agent Harold Pearson, who compiled the videotape, said more
than 66,000 partnerships were sold to viewers by the time Bakker
left PTL, despite a publicized limit of 25,000.
   ``All we need is 25,000 people to become members,'' Bakker said
on a program televised Feb. 20, 1984. ``That's all the memberships
we can have in the Heritage Grand Hotel. In two weeks, we will be
closed.''
   On the tape, Bakker consistently mentioned the restrictions.
   ``When we reach the cutoff number, we will have to refuse the
gifts,'' he told viewers. ``To be honest, we can't offer more
memberships than we can physically handle.''
   On a March 7, 1984, show, Bakker told viewers that about 1,000
partnerships had been sold each day since the promotion began 13
days earlier. But Pearson said records showed fewer than 7,300 had
been sold at that point.
   About a week earlier, Bakker said 12,500 partnerships had been
sold.
   ``The memberships will be gone in a few days,'' Bakker said.
   Zimbalist testified that the PTL board of directors did not
challenge Bakker.
   ``It was called a board of directors, but at no time did it
operate like one,'' said Zimbalist, star of ``The FBI'' television
series and board member from 1981 to 1986. ``It was a board of
approval or affirmation only.''
   Asked if he recalled approving a $390,000 bonus for Bakker,
Zimbalist said, ``Oh no, oh no.''
   The white-haired actor, who testified during a break in the
production in Spain of a television series, ``Zorro,'' said the
board was not informed of financial problems at its meetings.
   ``The financial condition of PTL was never discussed,'' he said.
   Asked if he would have approved bonuses had he known about the
financial condition of the ministry, Zimbalist said, ``I think I
would have left the board at that point if that were the case.''

   The Communist Party today handed President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev a chance next year to overhaul the party, which he said
was being left behind by the nation's rapid social changes.
   The party's 251-member Central Committee, its policy-making body,
opened a meeting primarily devoted to ethnic unrest throughout the
Soviet Union. But its first task was to reschedule the next congress
of about 5,000 party delegates for October 1990, the Tass news
agency said.
   ``The decision to convene the congress at an earlier date is
dictated by the need to thoroughly update the party itself, with
regard for its new role as the political vanguard of society during
the state of restructuring,'' Gorbachev told the Central Committee.
   He said the need to renew the party applied to the Central
Committee itself.
   A congress theoretically is the party's most powerful body,
setting broad policy lines as well as determining the membership of
the Central Committee and the ruling Politburo. It historically has
reviewed the leadership's economic plans for the ensuing five years.
   Congresses are usually held every five years, and by party
regulations the next congress would not have had to take place
before early 1991. The last, the 27th in the Communist Party's
history, was held in February 1986.
   That was less than a year after Gorbachev took power, when the
Soviet leader had not yet accumulated as much power as he has now.
   Gorbachev expressed concern that the party is lagging behind the
political reforms he has set in motion _ including the shift of more
political power to elected government bodies.
   ``The reconstruction forces are going at such a rhythm that we
often cannot catch up with them,'' Gorbachev said. He said many
party organizations were slow to grasp the need for change, and ``in
this, we lose a great deal.''
   ``We cannot leave things as they are, especially since
fundamental economic and social processes are unfolding and an
ideological and political struggle is under way over key problems of
social development,'' Gorbachev said.
   Some party stalwarts have said they fear the only legal political
party in the country is losing its grip on power, as the legislature
strengthens under Gorbachev's reform and frustrated citizens start
taking local power into their own hands.
   In addition to dissatisfaction with the poor state of the
economy, ethnic disputes across the country threaten to imperil
Gorbachev's reform drive.
   On the eve of today's meeting, Armenian activists appealed to
Moscow to order an end to what they call an economic blockade
imposed on their Caucasus Mountain republic by neighboring
Azerbaijan.
   In Azerbaijan, two policemen were knifed to death and two others
beaten by a mob of at least 200 people Monday near a blockaded road
in Nagorno-Karabakh, Tass reported today. The crowd attacking the
policemen, who were investigating an earlier dispute, Tass said.
   The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh
territory is among the oldest and most intractable facing the Soviet
Union's more than 100 ethnic groups.
   Armenia's call for Moscow's assistance to get supplies of food,
building materials and fuel from Azerbaijan shows how the ethnic
problems interlock with the Soviet Union's economic difficulties.
   ``There's no salt. There's no sugar. There's no oil, said Rem
Ananikyan, an editor of the official Armenian news agency Armenpress.
   Worse yet, he said that since the flow of supplies through
Azerbaijan dried up almost two months ago, reconstruction of
northwestern Armenian cities devastated by December's earthquake had
stopped.
   In a draft document published last month, the party suggested
that it is willing to look into opening the agreement made almost 70
years ago by which the Soviet Union was formed on the ashes of
czarist Russia.
   Besides Armenia and Azerbaijan, Gorbachev and the Communist Party
face ethnic disputes in at least seven other republics. Some have
been marked by persistent violence, with more than 200 people killed
in the past 18 months.
   Communist Party officials in the three Baltic republics of
Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia have joined in varying degrees with
informal political movements that are demanding sovereignty from
Moscow. That is a worrisome prospect for many in the Kremlin at a
time when some top officials are openly questioning whether the
party is losing its grip on power.

   Waitress Rose Betzer was in a lousy mood
when she showed up for work and didn't believe her boss when he told
her: ``You're serving the president.''
   ``Get outta here,'' she told him.
   It was no joke. President Bush, House Speaker Tom Foley and his
wife, Heather, and Environmental Protection Agency administrator
William Reilly had dinner Monday night at Patsy Clark's, an upscale
restaurant in a converted turn-of-the-century mansion.
   Ms. Betzer said her initial nervousness about serving the
president changed ``the minute I met him. He was just a wonderful,
nice man.''
   Bush and Foley ordered spinach salad and Jack Daniels steak,
which has a bourbon sauce. Bush took Foley's suggestion to try a
Washington state wine, ordering a chardonnay and a sauvignon blanc
from Spokane's Arbor Crest winery. They topped off their meal with a
huckleberry tart a la mode, Ms. Betzer said.
   Bush picked up the bill, $121 plus tip.
   ``You will take a check, won't you?'' he asked.

   Most foreign visitors go sight-seeing,
checking out things like the Grand Canyon or historical sites. But
Andre Borjesson is filling his time looking inside chimneys.
   Borjesson, 24, is a chimney sweep, touring the country for the
Swedish Chimney Sweep Guild to learn more about his profession and
to share Swedish techniques and tools.
   ``I'm like a spy here, trying to see what we can learn,'' he
joked.
   In the Belleville area, he's living and working with Hugh Maine,
owner of Maine Chimney Sweep.
   ``We've learned a lot more from this visit than the Swedes have
learned from us,'' Maine said.
   Chimney sweeping is an honored professions in Sweden, where
wood-stoves are widely used to combat the long winters.
   A clogged chimney can be a fire hazard. A huge fire that
destroyed much of Stockholm in the 1600s led to the establishment of
the chimney sweep profession and the setting of inspection standards.
   Now chimney sweeps and police are the only two professions in
Sweden allowed to wear a special belt buckle decorated with two
lions facing a crown.
   ``The queen gave us the belt buckle to honor the profession,''
Borjesson said.

<HEAD>Top Soviet Officer in Afghanistan Opposed Intervention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after Soviet forces intervened in
Afghanistan, the official press disclosed Tuesday that the top
Soviet soldier in Kabul opposed the move and lost his job because of
it.
   Gen. Ivan G. Pavlovsky was overruled by then-Soviet President
Leonid I. Brezhnev with the unanimous backing of the Communist Party
Politburo, the weekly Literary Gazette.
   The page-long article, printed in the paper's latest edition on
the decision to enter Afghanistan in December 1979, was based on
Anatoly Gromyko's recollections of his conversations with his
father, former Soviet Foreign Minister and President Andrei A.
Gromyko, and an interview with Pavlovsky.
   The report was the first in the Soviet press to disclose
high-level military opposition to the decision to enter Afghanistan.
   Before the Soviets completed their withdrawal on Feb. 15, 13,000
Soviet soldiers were killed. The war between forces of the
pro-Soviet Afghan government and anti-Marxist rebels continues.
   The newspaper report is part of a painful re-evluation of the
Soviet experience in Afghanistan, spurred by the return of thousands
of soldiers who suffered wounds in fighting or have not been able to
readjust to life at home.
   ``I reported to Dmitiri F. Ustinov, Politburo member, minister of
defense and marshal of the Soviet Union, that the entrance of our
soldiers into Afghanistan was not necesary,'' Pavlovsky told the
paper.
   He said he proposed instead that the Politburo send a
representative to Kabul to express Brezhnev's fears that Afghan
leader Hafizullah Amin would turn toward the United States.
   Soviet diplomats in Afghanistan at the time did not understand
the country, and no one took into account its history of guerrilla
resistance to foreign power, Pavlovsky said.
   The actual date of the Soviet intervention, Dec. 27, 1979, was
scheduled one day ahead of a meeting in Kabul between Afghan leaders
and the ambassador of Pakistan, Pavlovsky said. Pakistan is a close
ally of the United States and has served as a base and conduit of
military supplies to the Afghan rebels.
   Pavlovsky, now 80 years old, at the time was not only commander
of Soviet advisers in Afghanistan, but also a member of the
Communist Party Central Committee, a deputy defense minister and
commander of Soviet ground forces.
   But when he returned from Afghanistan he was removed from his
Defense Ministry posts and sent to serve in a group of military
inspectors, Literary Gazette said.
   The paper's political observer, Igor Belyaev, said Brezhnev in
September 1979 turned down the appeal of Afghan leader Nur Mohammad
Taraki for Soviet soldiers to help fight the anti-Marxist
resistance. Brezhnev told Taraki that intervention in Afghanistan by
Soviet soldiers would turn the majority of the population against
the pro-Soviet government, Belyaev said.
   Taraki had been installed as president after a coup in April 1978.
   But shortly after Taraki's meeting with Brezhnev, the Afghan
leader was killed in an dispute within the party, and Amin took over.
   ``Brezhnev was shaken by the murder of Taraki, who not long ago
had been his guest and thought that Amin's group could reach an
agreement with the United States,'' Gromyko quoted his father. The
elder Gromyko died in July.
   Amin was killed when Soviet soldiers entered the country, and he
was replaced by Babrak Karmal.
   The decision to enter Afghanistan has been criticized widely in
recent years as one made by a very small group of people.
   Gromyko, citing his father's recollections, noted that the
decision was indeed made behind the closed doors of Brezhnev's
office.
   But he said that it then was approved by a meeting of the
Communist Party Central Committee and that no one there or in the
leadership of the Soviet republics spoke out against the decision.
   ``You can disagree with this decision today, after 10 years, but
there is no basis to place under doubt the political foundations of
our aid to Afghanistan,'' Gromyko said.

<TEXT>
   Army scientists are gaining
ground in their quest for the ultimate smoke screen, a ``universal
obscurant'' that would baffle an enemy, fool ``smart'' weapons and
conceal friendly forces.
   Smoke is known to have cloaked some battles of the Peloponnesian
War in the fifth century B.C. and the same tactic plays a major role
in modern warfare, said Robert Watson, director of the Army's smoke
and obscurant project at this remote desert installation.
   ``In the greater scheme of things, it's one of the most
economical methods of providing a defensive and offensive posture,''
Watson said. ``It's a superb countermeasure to high-tech weapons.''
   American and Soviet interest in the subject intensified when
smoke was used to mask Israeli tanks from anti-tank guided missiles
during the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
   But the Soviets, who frequently used large-scale smoke screens in
World War II, jumped to an early lead and are believed to be
developing a ``universal obscurant,'' said Maj. Edward Newing, chief
of the Smoke Integration Proponency Office at Fort McClellan, Ala.
   Smokes are aerosols created by combustion of materials such as
phosphorus or vapor condensations from fog oil or diesel oil, while
obscurants include metallic chaff _ such as the shreds of aluminum
foil dropped from planes in World War II to reflect false images on
enemy radar _ or chemicals.
   Smoke, dispersed by generators or packaged in canisters and fired
from tanks, mortars, artillery or rockets, can blind opposing forces
or camouflage friendly troops from artillery or air attack.
   Delivered in the same way, obscurants can scatter the radiant
energy that soldiers and ``smart'' weapons use to track a target by
radar, thermal-infrared wavelengths or radio emissions.
   A heat-seeking missile, for example, focuses on infrared
wavelengths but can be deflected or misguided by an obscurant that
scatters the infrared energy, Watson said.
   ``The Army and Navy and Air Force are becoming increasingly
dependent on weapons systems that have electro-optical devices ...
and we are sometimes critically dependent on these weapons to
work,'' Newing said. ``Smoke and obscurants have the potential for
degrading or defeating them.''
   In the past five years, significant progress has been made in the
Army's research into a universal, or multi-spectral, obscurant
designed to be effective across the electromagnetic spectrum.
   Such an obscurant might be made of airborne particulates capable
of absorbing, scattering or reflecting electromagnetic energy, or
even form a self-radiating source that would make it impossible for
an enemy to distinguish between cloud and target.
   Details are classified, but Watson said field tests with soldiers
are just a few years away.
   ``We're probably 80 percent down the road to achieving the
goal,'' he said. ``It's well within sight.''
   The value of a universal obscurant is its flexibility, Newing
said.
   ``If you know what type of sensors your adversary has, and you
know what sensors you have, you can tailor your obscurant to affect
him and not you,'' he said.
   In the meantime, Newing said, soldiers receive regular training
in the use of smoke and obscurants, particularly in light of the
Soviet effort.
   ``Both of us are investing in modern technology and that's
increasing the lethality out there,'' he said. ``And when you have
something like obscurants that can alter lethality, it raises some
flags.''
   Smoke and obscurants were used at Dugway last summer when more
than 12,000 Army National Guard and reserve artillery soldiers
gathered for a live-fire training exercise.
   ``We're in a constant effort to make sure that smoke and
obscurants are spread and integrated as a system across all the
different types of branches _ artillery, aviation and infantry,''
Newey said. ``The Army is not underestimating the threat. We're
taking it seriously.''

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo spun toward the
Bahamas today after thrashing Puerto Rico with 125 mph winds,
leaving more than 50,000 people homeless throughout the eastern
Caribbean. An official reported at least 25 dead.
   Hugo hit northeastern Puerto Rico and then skirted its populous
northern coast on Monday. It roared on to the northwest and toward
open water, its hurricane-force winds missing the Dominican Republic.
   At noon EDT today, the hurricane's center was near latitude 22.2
degrees north and longitude 68.5 west, about 175 miles east
northeast of Grand Turk Island in the southern Bahamas, according to
the National Weather Service. Winds fell to 105 mph.
   Forecasters said it likely would hit the U.S. mainland later in
the week but said it was too early to predict where. Cruise ships
steamed out of the way, residents prepared along the North Carolina
coast and Florida residents jammed the phone lines of insurance
companies for financial protection.
   ``It's a long way from any potential landfall,'' said Bob Sheets,
director of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
``Unfortunately, the higher likelihood is that it will turn more
west and could make landfall anywhere from South Florida to North
Carolina.''
   At least 25 people in the Caribbean died from the storm, said
Cizanette Rivera, a spokeswoman for the Civil Defense in Puerto Rico.
   Maria Dolores Oronoz, a spokesman for Gov. Rafael
Hernandez-Colon, said only two people died on Puerto Rico. The two
died while trying to remove a TV antenna Sunday in preparation for
the storm, she said. She said no other deaths had been reported in
Puerto Rico.
   The National Weather Service in San Juan reported its preliminary
statement that said 25 had died on the U.S. commonwealth was
incorrect.
   Ms. Rivera gave no breakdown on where the other reported victims
had died, but scattered fatalities were reported throughout the
heavily visited tourist islands of the eastern Caribbean.
   Hugo left a trail of smashed homes, power failures and injuries
in Guadeloupe, Montserrat, Antigua and the Virgin Islands since
Sunday, and widespread looting by machete-wielding mobs was reported
on the island of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   Widespread evacuations apparently lessened the chance of
fatalities.
   Sailboats were blown out of the water and thrown up to 150 feet
on shore in St. Thomas, and some waterfront businesses have
disappeared.
   ``We were all huddled together in the corridor when the wind took
off the roof of the house,'' said 14-year-old Didier Gacoby-Kaoly of
Guadeloupe.
   Cleanup efforts were under way today throughout Puerto Rico. Gov.
Rafael Hernandez-Colon said at least 27,900 people were left
homeless and asked President Bush to declare it a disaster area.
   Hugo's winds overturned cars, peeled roofs off houses and office
buildings and sent chunks of concrete plunging into streets in San
Juan, where one-third of the U.S. commonwealth's 3.3 million people
live.
   The winds ripped out glass, walls and furnishings from the top
four floors of a 25-story building in the Santurce section, leaving
only beams remaining.
   Fifty airplanes were reported destroyed at the airport in Isla
Verde. Looters stripped shops of their goods in San Juan.
   Officials were working to restore power, which was cut to 75
percent of the island.
   Police cars with flashing lights patrolled San Juan streets early
today. Major streets were cleared, but secondary streets remained
clogged with power lines, tree limbs, sheets of metal and shattered
glass.
   Flooding made many roads impassable, and international
communications were disrupted.
   In the northeast town of Luquillo, 10 homes were swept downriver
and six families were reported missing, the weather service office
said.
   Civil Defense officials reported 80 percent of the homes on the
Puerto Rican islands of Vieques and Culebra were were either
destroyed or damaged.
   Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan said $500,000 in emergency
assistance funds were released to aid storm-stricken areas of Puerto
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   The weather service said maximum sustained winds had slowed to
near 105 mph with hurricane-force winds extending up to 60 miles
from the center. It was moving to the northwest at 12 mph and was
expected to continue in that direction during the next 24 hours.
   A hurricane watch was in effect for the central Bahamas and
tropical storm warnings for the southern Bahamas.
   Since Sunday, the storm has caused widespread damage in
Guadeloupe, Antigua, St. Kitts, Montserrat and the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands.
   Six people were killed and hundreds of buildings were flattened
on the British island of Montserrat, the British government said
today. It said nearly all of the 12,000 island residents were
homeless.
   Britain reported the Royal Navy marines landed on Montserrat to
help clear the airport runway so planes could deliver aid supplies.
British Overseas Aid Minister Lynda Chalker said Britain would
provide $1.57 million in emergency aid to islands struck by the
hurricane.
   Five people were reported killed, 84 injured and about 15,000
homeless on the French island of Guadeloupe. Two were killed in
Antigua.
   In Paris, the French Defense Ministry assigned 3,000 soldiers,
two military transport aircraft and four cargo vessels to assist in
restoring communications and emergency services to Guadeloupe.
French President Francois Mitterrand pledged to rebuild ``what was
destroyed.''
   Most of the Virgin Islands' 106,000 residents live on St. Thomas
and St. Croix, where a ham radio operator said winds had torn off
the roofs of up to 75 percent of the homes.
   Hugo is the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season and
is the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since Hurricane
David in 1979.
   That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the Caribbean and
Florida.
   Tropical Storm Iris rose in the wake of Hugo and forecasters
advised residents of the battered Leeward Islands to keep a close
watch on the new storm. They said Iris, with 50 mph winds, was about
300 miles east of the Leeward Islands Monday night and was moving
north-northwest at about 18 mph.

   Cambodia's rulers decorated departing
Vietnamese military chiefs Tuesday and said Vietnam's 11-year
occupation was not only legal but also ``humanitarian'' because it
stopped massacres by the Khmer Rouge.
   In a ceremony, authorities presented the Angkor Order _ a top
Cambodian military distinction _ to commanders of the eight army,
navy and air force units that are to begin leaving Thursday in what
Vietnam says will be the pullout of its last 26,000 troops.
   Chea Sim, the No. 2 man in Phnom Penh's ruling Communist Party,
pinned medals on the officers before making a speech praising them
for having toppled the fanatical Communist Khmer Rouge regime in
late 1978.
   ``The presence of the Vietnamese in Cambodia during the last 10
years is a legal act and humanitarian aid,'' he said of the
intervention, which was condemned by many non-Communist nations as a
violation of international law and the United Nations charter.
   ``The Khmer Rouge killed people. The people were scared all the
time,'' he said. ``The presence of the Vietnamese troops in Cambodia
has saved Cambodian lives.''
   Chea Sim quoted a Cambodian proverb: ``Best friends help each
other in time of need.''
   The Khmer Rouge killed a million people during its nearly
four-year experiment in creating a ``pure'' peasant society.
   It now is the largest member of the three-party guerrilla
coalition fighting the Vietnamese and the Phnom Penh government that
was installed days after the invasion.
   The fighting could escalate sharply after the Vietnamese pullout
because the Phnom Penh forces will stand alone against the Khmer
Rouge.
   Chea Sim, also president of the National Assembly, said the
guerrillas still oppose his government although it has amended the
constitution, overseen the Vietnamese pullout, and tried to find a
political settlement.
   He said that at the 19-nation talks in Paris, ``The enemy tried
to get the Khmer Rouge back to power...to get the murderers to kill
more people.''
   The talks in August collapsed when Phnom Penh rejected guerrilla
demands that the Khmer Rouge join a transitional government before
an election is held.
   The guerrillas have charged that Vietnam is hiding and disguising
troops instead of withdrawing them. They said the Soviet Union
recently escalated arms supplies to Phnom Penh, a charge the Soviet
ambassador to Phnom Penh, Rashit Khamidouline, denied Monday.
   In Ho Chi Minh City Tuesday, the Vietnamese government refused to
rule out fighting another war in Cambodia.
   Maj. Gen. Nguyen Van Thai, chief spokesman for the Ministry of
National Defense, also claimed that Vietnam's major achievement
during the war was not strategic but involved saving the Cambodian
people from genocide.
   He tacitly acknowledged that Vietnam had failed in its goal to
wipe out Cambodian resistance when he predicted factional fighting
would continue in Cambodia after the Vietnamese army withdraws.
   The officer spoke at a news conference to announce the start of
the last stage of Vietnam's withdrawal, which began in July 1988.
   ``In case of a threat of the genocidal regime coming back then I
think the government of the state of Cambodia would call on the
international community for help,'' he said. If called on for
assistance, Thai said, the Vietnamese army ``would then announce its
decision.''
   At the Bassack Hall in Phnom Penh, a clanging band blared martial
music as officials hailed the 150 Vietnamese soldiers at Tuesday's
two-hour ceremony.
   The soldiers received their decorations on a stage holding this
nation's autocrats _ the military commanders and members of the
Communist Party Politburo, its highest body. A red curtain behind
them displayed side-by-side national emblems _ Vietnam's yellow star
and Cambodia's Angkor Wat temple.
   After shrill, militant speeches laden with Communist jargon,
hundreds of school children wearing red kerchiefs _ the party's
``young pioneers'' _ marched into the hall beating drums and other
instruments.
   A little girl climbed onstage and _ her face hidden by the
microphones on the podium _ hailed the Vietnamese troops and
condemned the Khmer Rouge ``supported by China and the United
States.''
   ``Long live the heroic Vietnamese soldiers,'' she shouted three
times, a fist thrust high in the air.

   A judge has ordered arrest warrants for a
former Israeli army colonel and an Israeli civilian alleged to have
trained hit squads for Colombian drug cartels, officials said today.
   A spokeswoman for the Department of Security said in a telephone
interview that a 3rd Circuit Court judge issued the order Monday and
it was passed to Interpol, the international police organization.
   The arrest order for Yair Klein, a reserve lieutenant colonel in
the Israeli army, came a month after Colombia media reported he and
others trained gunmen for the cocaine cartels.
   In Venezuela, police said today they were holding a man with a
``strong resemblance'' to Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, one of the
reputed leaders of Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. But officials
would not confirm the identity of the man, arrested on the Colombian
border.
   Klein, now home in Tel Aviv, has said he trained Colombian
farmers to protect themselves against leftist guerrillas. He said
that if the men he trained were involved in drugs he was not aware
of that.
   Klein was the subject of a police investigation in Israel along
with five other Israelis suspected of training gunmen for Columbian
drug lords. The investigation was completed Sept. 8 but police have
not disclosed their findings and Klein has not been charged.
   In Jerusalem, a Foreign Ministry official said that Israel has no
extradition treaty with Colombia. The official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Israel had received no official
communications from Colombia regarding charges against Israelis.
   The Colombian spokeswoman, Diva Rojas, said a second warrant was
issued for Arik Acek, another Israeli whom she said allegedly helped
Klein leave Colombia. She identified Acek as a civilian who had an
arms business in Israel and flower shops in the United States.
   ``They are wanted for violating laws against conspiring, teaching
and enlisting civilians in military operations without the approval
of the Defense Ministry,'' Ms. Rojas said.
   She said the two are believed to have entered Colombia in August
1988 and to have left earlier this year after reports surfaced of
foreign mercenaries training hit squads for the Medellin and Cali
drug cartels.
   Reached in Tel Aviv today, Klein said: ``I didn't flee Colombia,
I left legally, with an exit stamp on my passport.'' An AP reporter
saw the stamp in a recent interview.
   Klein identified Acek as a friend who helped him with Spanish
translation in Colombia.
   Colombia's Congress last week began investigating reports of
foreign mercenaries in the country.
   Drug traffickers have used their private armies to kill more than
1,000 Colombian leftists in the last four years. The cartels are
also waging a violent war with the government.
   On Monday, two more bombs exploded in Bogota, one injuring three
people, and troops battling drug gang violence reported seizing a
22,000-acre ranch owned by a man reputed to be among top cocaine
barons.
   Security was stepped up at the U.S. Embassy, which was struck
Sunday night by a rocket that did not explode.
   The bombs exploded and at a government telephone company's
substation, a police spokesman said.
   No one has claimed responsibility for a rash of terrorist
shootings and bombings since Aug. 18, when the government cracked
down on Colombia's powerful drug bosses.
   There have been 47 bombings with 121 people injured in the last
three weeks. Four people have died. No one claimed responsibility,
but security forces assume all were the work of drug traffickers.
   The shopping center explosion in this capital of 6 million people
injured a child, a man and a woman, the Colombian radio chain RCN
said in a report from the scene.
   A man was seen placing the bomb in a pile of garbage bags in
front of a store, witnesses told an RCN reporter.
   Soldiers on Sunday seized a 22,000-acre ranch belonging to
billionaire Rodriguez Gacha, said a spokesman with the army's 13th
Brigade headquarters in Bogota.
   Rodriguez Gacha is suspected of being a key figure in the
Medellin cocaine cartel that supplies most of the cocaine
distributed in the United States.
   Also seized with the ranch in central Cundinamarca state were
5,000 head of cattle and 300 show horses, he said.
   Last month, the army seized 18 ranches belonging to Rodriguez
Gacha, who is among 12 Colombian drug figures wanted in the United
States.
   The ranches were seized under emergency powers instituted by
President Virgilio Barco to counter a wave of terror by Colombia's
cocaine lords.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle met Tuesday
with Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon, while hundreds of student
radicals held rallies denouncing the South Korean government and the
United States.
   Quayle praised South Korea's recent democratic reforms but asked
Kang why political violence continued, a South Korean official said.
   Kang replied that it was because the Korean people still have
little experience with democracy and tend to shun compromise and
stick to a ``logic of choosing between black and white,'' the source
said.
   The official, who demanded anonymity, said Quayle and Kang
discussed a wide range of issues, including the future of the 43,000
U.S. troops in South Korea. David Beckwith, Quayle's spokesman, said
they discussed subjects ranging from President Roh Tae-woo's visit
to Washington Oct. 26 to East-West relations.
   ``The meeting was productive, and I am looking forward to meeting
and learning about the Korean people,'' Quayle told reporters.
Neither he nor Kang would describe what they discussed.
   During the 45-minute meeting, hundreds of radical students held
anti-government, anti-U.S. rallies on at least five college
campuses. The students represent a small minority that has failed to
win widespread support.
   Hundreds of riot police ringed the schools, but there were no
reports of arrests or injuries.
   At Kyunghee University in eastern Seoul, 50 students burned a
U.S. flag and an effigy of Quayle. They also shouted slogans calling
the new U.S. ambassador, Donald Gregg, a ``CIA master of political
manipulation.''
   Protests were also reported at three other campuses in Seoul,
including Seoul Municipal Polytech University, where 100 students
burned a U.S. flag and chanted, ``We oppose Quayle's visit to the
death.''
   In the southern provincial city of Kwangju, 500 radical students
shouted ``Yankee go home!'' and battled police with firebombs and
rocks, police said.
   The protests were small by South Korean standards, and dissident
groups made no effort to organize street demonstrations against
Quayle's visit.
   The radicals are demanding an end to close ties with Washington
and expulsion of the U.S. troops based in South Korea.
   Quayle is on the first stop of an Asian trip that also will take
him to Japan, the Philippines and Malaysia. He meets on Wednesday
with Roh and heads of the main opposition political parties, which
often clash with Roh.
   South Korean opposition leaders planned to tell Quayle about
their concerns over deteriorating human rights, opposition party
officials said. A National Assembly report released Sunday said
2,094 people had been detained on political charges since Roh came
to power in February 1988.
   U.S. officials, who demanded anonymity, said Quayle would urge
the Roh government to show greater respect for human rights in view
of the jailings and other government moves to curb opposition.
   Roh has introduced broad democratic reforms since he took office,
but opposition groups claim that the reforms made so far are not
enough.
   U.S. officials have expressed concern about the recent indictment
of top South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae-jung on charges
connected with an opposition lawmaker's secret trip to Communist
North Korea last year.
   Under South Korean law, failure to report visits to North Korea
can be punished by a five-year prison term. The two Koreas are
bitter enemies.

   Rep. Barney Frank is wrestling with the
question of whether he can remain an effective liberal in Congress
following the disclosure of his relationship with a male prostitute,
his friends and allies say.
   An aide to Frank said Monday the Massachusetts Democrat will not
resign his congressional seat despite calls for his resignation by
newspapers in his district.
   Frank declined to be interviewed Monday, but in a weekend
interview with the Boston Globe said he will not seek re-election
next year if he decides the controversy hurts the liberal causes he
has espoused during 10 years in Congress.
   ``The question for him to decide, that will make the difference
... is whether he believes he could be an effective member of
Congress, that he would not do this just to go through the
motions,'' said Ann Lewis, Frank's sister and a Washington political
consultant.
   Frank disclosed his homosexuality in 1987 and won re-election the
next year with 70 percent of the vote in a district that has elected
him five times to Congress.
   Democratic strategists said they believe Frank's support within
his own district remains strong, despite the revelations about his
involvement with prostitute Stephen L. Gobie. But they said Frank
may feel pressure to resign because of the scandal's effects on his
issues or other Democrats.
   The Boston Globe, which enthusiastically endorsed Frank
throughout his political career, said in an editorial Sunday that he
should resign for ``his own good, and for the good of his
constituents, his causes and Congress.''
   The Anchor, a small but influential Roman Catholic newspaper in
his district, called on Frank to resign last week.
   Doug Cahn, Frank's administrative assistant, said: ``Barney will
not resign. He wants to see the process with the Ethics Committee
move forward.''
   The House ethics committee is investigating Frank's dealings with
Gobie, at Frank's request.
   One group of supporters, the liberal arms-control group Council
for a Livable World, circulated a letter Monday urging Frank to
ignore calls for his resignation. It said, ``Even a Barney Frank
whose effectiveness in Congress is somewhat diminished this year
still ranks among the most effective members in the U.S. Congress.''
   Frank has acknowledged that he paid Gobie for sexual relations
after responding to an ad in a gay newspaper in 1985, and then hired
him as a personal assistant. Frank said hoped to help Gobie give up
his past, but Gobie said he used Frank's apartment for prostitution
and that Frank was aware of his activities. Frank says he did not
know.
   In a taped interview on the ``Geraldo'' talk show telecast today,
Gobie elaborated on his claims, saying he ran a female escort
service called ``A Touch of Class,'' from the congressman's
apartment. A friend who ran a male escort service also occasionally
call-forwarded telephone service to Gobie, he said.
   ``I more or less served as a reservation clerk for the girls,''
he said.
   In an interview with Newsweek, Frank said Gobie ``wasn't the
first prostitute I had used.''
   Frank said that because of his difficulties he will lessen his
role on one issue _ the investigation of alleged influence-peddling
at the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Reagan
administration. He is a member of the House subcommittee leading the
HUD investigation.
   Frank has been outspoken in a number of liberal causes, but
particularly in areas of ethics legislation, housing, and homosexual
rights.
   Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center
on Homelessness and Poverty, described Frank as one of the leading
advocates for housing programs in Congress and said his problems are
a concern to other housing advocates.
   ``I think there's some concern about the effect that this will
have on his advocacy,'' she said. ``The question is whether the
issue will become so consuming that it will obscure his ability to
take positions on substantive issues.''
   Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund,
said other members of Congress have overcome embarrassing personal
disclosures or poor judgment, adding that in the long term ``his
effectiveness as an important public servant should in no way be
harmed by his personal misjudgments.''
   Dorothy Reichard, director of Frank's district office in Newton,
Mass., said calls and letters have been running 8-to-1 in support.

   The former president of Southeastern
Oklahoma State University was sentenced to 10 years in prison today
for defrauding the school of more than $3.4 million, including
$39,000 spent on furniture for his home.
   A federal jury convicted Leon Hibbs, 59, in July.
   Hibbs asked for a community-service sentence. But U.S. District
Judge Ralph Thompson said the former university president had his
chance at public service and ``you exploited it.''
   Hibbs was convicted of giving students on scholarship no-show
jobs instead of paying them out of a scholarship fund. He then
diverted money from the fund to friends and relatives and bought a
trailer and furniture for his home, prosecutors said.
   Hibbs repaid the money taken from the fund by putting family
members and others on the state payroll in jobs that required little
or no work and having their salaries deposited into the scholarship
fund.
   He was also convicted of conspiring to collect $90,000 in
insurance on a race horse that never was sold for that amount.

   The drug was found stashed in the gearbox of a truck driven by a

   Police, acting on a tip from Interpol, the international law
enforcement agency, stopped the truck in Budapest on Sept. 14.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee endorsed
on Wednesday the nomination of Edward J. Perkins, the U.S.
ambassador to South Africa, to be director general of the U.S.
Foreign Service.
   If approved by the Senate as is expected, Perkins will become the
highest ranking black diplomat in the history of the State
Department.
   Perkins, 61, a native of Sterlington, La., was named the chief
U.S. envoy to the South African government in 1986, the first black
ever to be named to that post.
   He previously had served as U.S. ambassador to Liberia and has
been director of the State Department's Office of West African
Affairs.
   Perkins served three years in the Army beginning in 1947, then
served four years in the Marine Corps.
   In 1958, he began a career as a personnel officer in Army and Air
Force exchanges in Taiwan and Okinawa.
   He graduated from the University of Maryland in 1967 and received
advanced degrees, including a doctorate of public administration,
from the University of Southern California in 1972 and 1978.
   In another action, the committee also endorsed the nomination of
eight other State Department officials.
   The list includes William Andreas Brown, a career Foreign Service
officer, named by President Bush to be ambassador to Israel.
   Brown, 69, is currently serving as U.S. ambassador to Thailand.
   The committee also recommended the Senate approve Thomas C.
Dawson II to be U.S. executive director of the International
Monetary Fund; Warren A. Lavorel to be U.S. coordinator for
multilateral trade negotiations; James R. Cheek to be ambassador to
the Sudan; Lannon Walker to be ambassador to Nigeria; Johnny Young
to be ambassador to Sierra Leone; Richard Wood Boehm to be
ambassador to Oman and Mark G. Hambley to be ambassador to Qatar.

   An earthquake shook northwestern Greece on
Tuesday, but no injuries or damage were reported, authorities said.
   The Athens Geodynamic Institute said the quake, which occurred at
10:57 a.m., measured 4.9 on the Richter scale and its epicenter was
165 miles northwest of Athens in the Ioannina area.
   Inhabitants within a 40-mile radius of the epicenter felt the
tremor, a spokesman for the institute said.
   Police contacted by telephone in Ioannina reported residents of
the city remained calm despite the strength of the jolt.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   A magnitude 5 earthquake can cause considerable damage.

<TEXT>
   John Zaccaro, the son of former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, cited sloppy police
tactics when he asked the Vermont Supreme Court to overturn his
conviction on a cocaine charge.
   ``The issue is how freely the government can enter a house in
disguise,'' Kathleen Sullivan, Zaccaro's lawyer, said Monday during
oral arguments.
   Zaccaro, 26, was convicted last year of selling a quarter gram of
cocaine to an undercover police woman at his off-campus apartment in
Middlebury in 1986. He served his sentence, but has appealed the
conviction in an effort to clear his record.
   The court is not expected to rule before December.
   Sullivan, a Harvard law professor, said state police should have
found a witness or come up with solid evidence before sending an
undercover officer to Zaccaro's home while he was a student at
Middlebury College.
   Prosecutor Susan Harritt contended before the court that police
did not violate Zaccaro's rights because the undercover officer was
invited into his home, clearly stated her intention to buy cocaine
and made the purchase without disguising her identity.
   ``The state sees this in a fundamentally different way,'' she
said. ``This case, in fact, does not involve a search. If the court
believes that a search did take place, no warrant was needed because
the officer was invited into the home.''
   Zaccaro, who recently opened a New York pasta shop, appeared at
ease during the hearing, talking and laughing with lawyers. He would
not comment before or after the hearing, other than to compliment
his lawyers and express confidence the court would be fair.
   Zaccaro was sentenced to a term of one to five years, with all
but four months suspended. He served the four months in a so-called
``house arrest'' program that allowed him to live in a
$1,500-a-month apartment with maid service and cable television.
   The trial followed legal wrangling over whether Zaccaro was
selectively prosecuted due to his mother's fame. Sullivan's state
Supreme Court brief again raised the claim, but she did not cover
the issue during oral arguments.

   A Soviet weightlifter who won the

the Turkish Embassy and asked for asylum, the Foreign Ministry said
Tuesday.
   The 125-pound weightlifter, Hafiz Suleymanov, performed last
week, but ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman would not say when the
defection took place.
   Government officials said a charter plane will be sent to Athens
to bring Suleymanov, who is an ethnic Turk, to Turkey.
   This is the second defection of a champion weightlifter from the

expected to meet with government officials in Puerto Rico today,''
Fitzwater said.
   He said requests for federal emergency aid will be reviewed and
expedited.

of that tax year.
   They didn't.
   Lawshea filed for a slightly bigger rent return the following
year. He got that, too. Minnesotans can deduct a percentage of their
rent as a homestead tax credit; the percentage changes from year to
year.
   But state revenue agents caught on to Lawshea, an inmate at the
Stillwater State Prison in 1986 when they noticed an invalid Social
Security number on his tax return, said Bruce Showel, director of
criminal apprehension for the state Revenue Department.
   Lawshea was an inmate of the Stillwater State Prison from 1983 to
October 1984 for a fraud conviction.
   Lawshea, 34, pleaded guilty Monday to filing a false tax return
for the 1983 tax year. An identical charge for the 1984 tax year was
dropped as part of a plea agreement, Showel said. Sentencing was set
for Jan. 26; he faces a maximum of 24 months.
   According to court records, Lawshea filed for the $1,118 rent
refund on a Duluth ``apartment'' that turned out to be a bar and
restaurant. He received and cashed the check and repeated the
offense in 1985 when he filed for a $1,125 credit for the 1984 tax
year, Showel said.
   Washington County Attorney Dick Arney said his office handles
many cases of fraud dreamed up by inmates at the two state prisons
in the county. Past cases include credit-card fraud and
bad-check-cashing schemes, he said.
   ``We've had everything you can think of, but this rates high on
the creativity scale,'' Arney said.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze to Meet Bush, Baker as Superpower Relations Changing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze meet in Wyoming at a
time of tumultuous change in superpower relations, ranging from
reforms in the Soviet Union to talk of reunification of a Germany
divided when the Cold War began four decades ago.
   The changes have produced pressures on President Bush and on
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who likely is sending his
foreign minister with new ideas for cuts in strategic arms, the
experts say.
   Bush, meanwhile, is being pushed to respond more warmly to
changes under way in the Soviet bloc.
   Shevardnadze will talk with Bush Thursday at the White House,
then will head for Jackson Hole, Wyo., to meet through the weekend
with Baker.
   An exploding volcano might be a more fitting backdrop than the
immovable Grand Teton Mountains for the Baker-Shevardnadze
discussion of changes under way in the communist world.
   Since they last met in July, a major postwar milestone has been
passed, the installation of a Solidarity government in Poland, the
first non-communist regime in the Soviet bloc.
   Hungary, another Warsaw Pact nation, is also moving toward a
multi-party system, and the speaker of the Hungarian parliament was
quoted in the Washington Post on Tuesday predicting his nation would
ultimately leave the Soviet-led military alliance. Precisely that
step precipitated the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956.
   Also, Hungary's allowing of thousands of East German refugees to
cross into Austria has riveted world attention on Eastern Europe.
And Gorbachev has had to concern himself at home with surging
sentiment for more self-determination _ or even independence _ in a
growing number of Soviet republics.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said in a speech
Tuesday, ``The tremendous change in the nature of our discourse with
the Soviet leadership is primarily the result of unprecedented and
exciting developments which are taking place in the Soviet Union,''
   But the crushing of pro-democracy forces in China and warnings by
Gorbachev of a possible conservative coup in the Soviet Union are
stark reminders that all change is not permanent, and that
superpower relations could be plunged back into the bad old days of
the Cold War.
   ``Things may well get out of control, but they are unlikely to
lead to a peaceful evolution toward liberal democracy'' in the
Soviet Union, retired Lt. Gen. William Odom said in a speech Sept. 9.
   ``Civil war and disorder followed by reassertion of
authoritarianism seem more probable,'' said Odom, who spent his
military career watching the Soviet Union, including a stint as head
of the supersecretive National Security Agency.
   Gorbachev, in reforming Soviet foreign policy, has withdrawn
threatening tank forces from Eastern Europe, announced a cut of
500,000 in the Red Army, and declared a ``defensive doctrine.''
   ``Mr. Gorbachev has made many people in Europe and the United
States believe that the Soviet military threat has gone away. It has
not, of course, but there are some signs that it will decline,''
said Odom, advocating a cautious response, similar to that espoused
by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   The administration's restraint has come under from fire from
liberals, who want the White House to encourage change in the Soviet
Union and supply greater levels of aid to nations like Poland that
are on the troubled road of reform.
   ``President Bush must reach beyond the status quo thinking that
appears to dominate administration speaking,'' Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell of Maine said Monday.
   ``He must cast aside ambivalence and hesitation and timidity and
adopt a more energetic and engaged policy toward the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe,'' Mitchell said.
   Bush administration officials have moved within the past week to
keep pace with changes in the Soviet bloc, saying they will double
food deliveries to Poland, to $100 million, and grant
most-favored-nation status to Hungary to reduce tariffs on Hungarian
exports to the United States.
   The president reacted carefully Monday when asked about possible
reunification of Germany. That's for the Germans to decide, he
answered, though he added that such a move should not be viewed ``as
bad for Western interests.''
   The administration has also tried to expand the U.S.-Soviet
dialogue to new areas such as fighting terrorism and drug
trafficking and cleaning up the environment.
   The plan, Bush says, is to integrate the Soviet Union more deeply
into the community of law-abiding nations.
   ``Today, we are witnessing what are potentially the first steps
in the transformation of a totalitarian society into one governed by
the rule of law,'' Eagleburger told a meeting of the National
Conference on Soviet Jewry.
   ``And as these changes unfold, the relationship between the
United States and the Soviet Union could move from an adversarial to
a cooperative one,'' he said.
   In addition the expanding dialogue, Shevardnadze will push hard
for arms control progress when he meets Bush at the White House
Thursday and may be carrying a new Kremlin proposal, experts say.
   ``It would be customary'' for Shevardnadze to hand Bush a letter
from the Soviet leader, and ``Gorbachev being Gorbachev, it would
not be too surprising for it contain some dramatic proposals,'' said
one administration official, speaking on condition he not be further
identified.
   Although sticking points remain in the proposed Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START), Shevardnadze and Baker are expected to
announce several important steps on other topics, including:
   _ An ``agreed statement'' expanding superpower human rights
dialogue from such traditional areas as emigration to new topics
involving cooperation on occupational safety, the environment and
the criminal code.
   _ A agreement on determining the chemical weapon stockpiles of
each side preliminary to a multilateral agreement sharply curbing
the production or possession of such arms.
   _ A protocol on verifying treaties signed in 1974 and 1976, but
never ratified by the U.S. Senate, barring each side from testing
nuclear devices of greater than 150 kilotons.

   After she recovers from a heart attack,
Mother Teresa will have to give up the hectic schedule that earned
her a Nobel Peace Prize and adapt to a slower pace, her doctors said
Tuesday.
   ``Her heart is old and she's not young,'' Dr. George Lombardi, an
infectious disease specialist from the United States, told a news
conference. ``At least for the time being, she will have to change
her lifestyle.''
   A medical bulletin issued late Tuesday said Mother Teresa's
condition is improving and she has had no chest pains since Monday.
Her temperature also has been normal, one of her physicians said.
   Despite recent health problems, the 79-year-old Roman Catholic
nun has traveled the world incessantly to offer care and comfort to
the poor.
   Mother Teresa, who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work,
suffered a heart attack on Sept. 8, three days after she was
admitted to Woodlands Nursing Home with a high fever and acute
vomiting.
   Doctors attached a temporary pacemaker, but it was removed after
she developed chest pains. She has been taking steroids since then,
they said.
   ``Her temprature has been controlled, but the problem remains
with her intermittent chest pains. We are rather concerned about
that. Otherwise, she is comfortable,'' said Dr. Rajen Watts.
   ``The angina pain is serious but not critical,'' he said.
   Watts said Mother Teresa's temperature is now 97.6 and that she
is conscious, eating well and resting comfortably.
   Watts also said a viral infection that triggered the fever now is
under control. He said doctors still do not know the cause and are
awaiting results from blood samples sent to the Tropical Disease
Institute.
   ``The virus, however, has affected her heart,'' he said.
   Doctors also said the frail nun had developed a secondary
infection, which also has not been diagnosed.
   ``We are hopeful that this will go in a couple of days,''
Lombardi said.
   Although they gave no time frame, doctors said Mother Teresa's
recovery probably will take longer than the normal four to six weeks.
   The Yugoslav-born nun developed chest pains and a high fever
Thursday, a week after the heart attack. Doctors said the setback
may have been caused partly by a steady stream of visitors to the
hospital's intensive care unit. On Monday, doctors said no one would
be allowed to see her.
   Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity in October 1950
in an abandoned hostel donated by the city. The order, formally
recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and now has 3,000 nuns
working in 87 countries.

<HEAD>Vermont's High Court Hears John Zaccaro Drug Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for John Zaccaro Jr. asked
Vermont's Supreme Court to throw out his cocaine-peddling
conviction, arguing that police set up the undercover buy on the
basis of campus rumors, not hard evidence.
   ``The issue is how freely the government can enter a house in
disguise,'' Kathleen Sullivan argued Monday. ``This undercover was
arranged solely on the basis of rumor, nothing like hard evidence,
nothing like reasonable suspicion.''
   The 26-year-old son of former vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro was convicted last year of selling a quarter gram
of cocaine to an undercover police woman at his off-campus apartment
in 1986 while a student at Middlebury College.
   Zaccaro served four months' house arrest in a $1,500-a-month
apartment with maid service and cable television but is seeking to
clear his record.
   Sullivan said State Police should have found a witness or located
solid evidence before sending an undercover officer into Zaccaro's
home.
   But Assistant Attorney General Susan Harritt countered that
police did not violate Zaccaro's rights because the undercover
officer was invited into his home, clearly stated her intention to
buy cocaine and made the purchase without disguising her identity.
   ``(The officer) said, `I understand I can buy some drugs from
you,' and he said, `Sure, come on in,''' Harritt told the court.
``She was not asked to explain anything about herself. He didn't ask
her whether or not she was police.''
   Associate Justice John Dooley told Harritt he was troubled about
some aspects of the probe, noting that rumors abound on college
campuses.
   Zaccaro, who has recently opened a New York pasta shop, declined
to comment other than to compliment his lawyers and express
confidence the court would render a fair decision.
   His lawyers have argued also that Zaccaro was selectively
prosecuted because of his mother's fame.

   Voters went to the polls today in a 13-way primary
that could bring a city councilman one step closer to becoming
Seattle's first black mayor.
   Norm Rice, who is black, was considered the frontrunner in the
non-partisan race, in which the top two vote-getters will advance to
the general election. The councilman's opponent in November was
expected to be city Attorney Doug Jewett or former King County
Executive Randy Revelle.
   Bob Bruce, King County election superintendent, predicted 103,000
of Seattle's 295,000 registered voters would go to the polls in the
race to replace Mayor Charles Royer. That's a moderate turnout of
about 35 percent.
   Royer, who beat Rice four years ago, is not seeking a fourth term
and has accepted a post at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government.
   Rice, 46, is a former broadcast reporter, Urban League official
and a banker. He said he jumped into the race because of what he
called a divisive anti-school busing initiative. The measure will be
on the November ballot.
   Jewett is co-sponsor of the initiative, and backers say he can
ride it into the mayor's office.
   In Spokane, where President Bush was to help celebrate the state
centennial today, two City Council members were favored to advance
to the November general election.
   In Tacoma, where Mayor Doug Sutherland is stepping down after two
terms and eyeing a gubernatorial bid, six candidates were vying for
two runoff spots.

   A stuffed animal attached to the
window of a family's pickup truck deflected a mysterious gunshot and
saved a 5-year-old girl from serious injury, police said.
   Cynthia Guerrero suffered some facial cuts Sunday night when the
window was shattered by the .22-caliber bullet. Police don't know
who fired the shot.
   ``While passing through the window the bullet apparently struck
the lower body of the stuffed animal, causing the bullet to change
direction and minimize the injury to the child,'' Sgt. John Priest
said in his report on the incident.
   The doll of the cartoon and comic strip cat Garfield was attached
to the window with suction cups.

   The Pentagon said Tuesday that some of its
facilities had sustained ``very heavy damage'' from Hurricane Hugo
and that it was evacuating about 600 U.S. workers and dependents
from a submarine center in the Bahamas as a precaution.
   ``Virtually every structure received some damage, some of it
severe,'' at the U.S. Naval Station at Roosevelt Roads in Puerto
Rico, Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters.
   No significant injuries were reported, he added.
   The spokesman said a lack of full information meant that no cost
estimates of the damage had been drawn up.
   Hugo hit northeastern Puerto Rico and then skirted its populous
northern coast Monday. Hurricane warnings were in effect for the
southern Bahamas.
   Since Sunday, the storm also has caused widespread damage in
Guadeloupe, Antigua, St. Kitts, Montserrat and the U.S. and British
Virgin Islands.
   The Navy's airfield at the Roosevelt Roads station was closed
overnight, but has since been reopened. Many of the runway's lights
were damaged, Hoffman said.
   He said the military was evacuating approximately 600 people from
the Naval Undersea Center on Andros Island in the Bahamas as a
precautionary measure.
   The evacuees are a mix of U.S. government personnel, civilians
and dependents of those who work at the center, which focuses on
anti-submarine warfare, officials said.
   Hoffman said an Air Force satellite tracking center on Antigua
``suffered very heavy damage'' while a solar observatory at Ramey
Air Force Base in Puerto Rico was also hit.
   The spokesman said U.S. forces were participating in offering
airlift support of relief cargos to St. John in the U.S. Virgin
Islands and Antigua in the British Virgin Islands.

<TEXT>
   An under-cuddled German teddy bear fetched a world
record $86,000 at an auction Tuesday, more than four times the
previous highest price for a teddy bear and 60 times its catalogue
estimate, Sotheby's said.
   ``When I told the owner the news, he said: `I think that works
out at 1,000 pounds ($1,570) a hair.' He was very pleased and very
happy,'' said Sotheby's appraiser Bunny Campione.
   The two-tone bear, made by German manufacturer Steiff in 1920,
has unusually large eyes that ``make it look a little forlorn'' and
is in such good condition ``it doesn't look as if it has been
cuddled very much,'' she said.
   Mrs. Campione said the bear had been expected to sell for up to
$7,800 but had earlier been listed in an auction house catalogue at
$1,100 to $1,400.
   ``There is no justifiable reason why it made so much money,'' she
said in a telephone interview.
   The previous highest auction price for a teddy bear was $19,000,
paid at a Christie's auction in London on May 18 for a Steiff bear
made between 1906 and 1909 for Princess Xenia, a cousin of Czar
Nicholas II.
   Sotheby's record-busting bear is 24 inches long, has plush fur in
blond and brown, amber-and-black glass eyes measuring about 1 inch
in diameter, swivel joints, a humped back and widely spaced ears.
   The buyer, represented by a British agent, insisted on anonymity.
The bear had belonged to an unidentified British man who inherited
it from his grandmother, Mrs. Campione said.
   ``The grandmother considered him (the bear) to be very much her
own and kept him away from the children who were allowed to see him
but not to play with him,'' she said.
   Mrs. Campione, a fine-doll expert, said she was baffled by the
sale price for a bear that was hardly rare.
   ``A few thousand were made in 1920 instead of a few million,''
but it is in unusually ``superb condition,'' she said. ``Most of
them are cuddled or kissed on the nose so much that the nose gets
dented in, or get dragged around the garden by children.''
   She speculated that the buyer may want the bear as a prototype
for limited edition.
   At the first teddy bear auction organized by Mrs. Campione at
Sotheby's in 1982, the most expensive teddy went for $630.
   Richard Steiff's lovable creations took the world by storm at the
Leipzig toy fair in 1903, and valuable teddies are now almost
exclusively made by Steiff at the village of Giengen in southern
Germany.

<HEAD>Vermont Justice Found Guilty of Misconduct</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER GRAFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vermont's Supreme Court ruled today that
one of its retired justices was guilty of judicial misconduct for
helping a female friend who was a lower-court judge.
   The ruling said retired Justice William Hill committed seven
ethics violations, primarily for sitting on cases involving former
Assistant Judge Jane Wheel and for intimidating the state attorney
general by personally delivering a letter urging that a criminal
probe of Wheel be speeded up.
   Hill, 72, was one of three Supreme Court justices charged with
misconduct in 1987 by the Judicial Conduct Board, an arm of the
court. The board alleged the three improperly used their clout to
help Wheel, then an assistant judge in Chittenden County, in a
variety of matters.
   The charges threw the five-member court into turmoil. Gov.
Madeleine Kunin asked the three to step aside while the accusations
were examined. They refused, but disqualified themselves from all
cases involving anyone involved in the complaints, which affected
hundreds of cases.
   The charges against Justice Ernest Gibson III were dropped for
lack of a case. Justice Thomas Hayes died before the allegations
against him were resolved.
   A court employee testified that Wheel had been seen with her arms
around Hill, but Hill and Wheel testified they were not close and
did not have an affair. Hill described their relationship as
collegial.
   The Judicial Conduct Board found Hill guilty of 11 counts of
misconduct, but it was up to the state's high court to decide Hill's
fate. Today, the high court dismissed four counts but upheld the
others.
   ``A judge can never avoid the prestige and authority of the
office he or she holds,'' said the court. ``That prestige and
authority, however, may not be used to enhance personal
relationships, or for selfish reasons, or to bestow favors.''
   The court said it would hear arguments next week on what
sanctions to impose against Hill. Because Hill is retired, the
sanctions range from a reprimand to suspension from service as a
substitute justice on high court cases.
   Hill's pension will not be affected.
   Hill's lawyer, Michael Marks, said he and Hill felt the decision
was a ``mixed bag.''
   The case was heard by a specially assigned court since most of
the members who sat on the court with Hill disqualified themselves.
   Wheel was convicted in a separate criminal case involving
allegations she billed the state for days she did not work.

   President Bush, declaring that ``sound
ecology and a strong economy can coexist,'' prodded Congress today
to pass his legislation to clean up the nation's fouled air.
   In a speech at a riverfront celebration of Washington's 100th
anniversary of statehood, Bush called upon ``all Americans to join
in a renewed spirit of conservation,'' including recycling their
trash and generating less waste.
   With House Speaker Thomas Foley, the hometown Democratic
congressman, at his side, the president said, ``When it comes to
clear air, we need action on the legislation we've proposed _ now.''
   Bush, who sent the clean air bill to Capitol Hill on July 21,
said, ``Every day that passes is another day we're postponing
progress on clean air. ... Now it is up to the Congress to pass this
clean air legislation this year.''
   Bush has been sparring with the Democratic-controlled Congress
over drugs and other issues, but Foley told reporters Monday he
expects Congress to send Bush a clean air bill to his liking either
late this year or early in 1990.
   ``It will be an achievement for both the Congress and the
administration,'' Foley said. The plan now is in House and Senate
subcommittees.
   Bush proposed a 10-billion-ton reduction in acid rain-producing
sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000, a 2-million-ton reduction
in nitrous oxide and a 40 percent cut in other emissions that cause
urban smog. It also calls for use of alternative fuels in 1 million
vehicles by 1997.
   Environmentalists and their allies in Congress have criticized
the goals as too modest and say the plan would leave too much to the
discretion of the Environmental Protection Agency, and in some cases
to the affected industries.
   Bush, winding up a two-day swing that also took him to centennial
celebrations in South Dakota and Montana, said the ``majestic''
Spokane River _ coursing through downtown Spokane over waterfalls
and volcanic outcroppings _ ``has been reborn'' from its
once-polluted state, a symbol of the nation's environmental progress.
   ``I took this trip out West because I'm concerned ... about the
future of the planet we share,'' the president said.
   ``Today I'm asking all Americans to join in a renewed spirit of
conservation, a new commitment to a more careful stewardship of the
natural world.''
   Bush called for applying ``the creativity of the marketplace in
the service of the environment. Sound ecology and a strong economy
can coexist.''
   He lauded a waste-disposal fee system in Seattle that he said has
cut waste by nearly one-fourth. Those results, he said ``need to be
duplicated everywhere in America.''
   ``Local communities, businesses large and small, individual
families _ all can learn to generate less waste and recycle more of
the waste that is generated,'' Bush said.
   At the event witnessed by thousands in Riverfront Park, Foley
called Bush's appearance ``a proud movement for the State of
Washington'' and ``a high honor'' for himself.
   The president returned the compliment, calling Foley ``a man of
integrity, decency, fair play _ and _ OK, he's a Democrat, but he's
a man I am very proud and honored to work with.''
   After the speech, Bush and Foley picked up shovels to plant a
centennial elm sappling transplanted from a White House tree, then
left the park to return to Washington aboard Air Force One.
   Bush, in a news conference Monday in the Montana state Senate
chambers in Helena , urged Congress ``to get on with'' his $7.9
billion anti-drug strategy. ``The American people want action.''
   ``There's a certain frustration level when we come out with a
sound program and two answers come out: spend more and raise
taxes,'' he said.
   Elsewhere in the news conference, Bush:
   _Announced plans to grant Hungary most favored nation trading
status in recognition of its political and economic reforms.
   _Said he feels ``in no rush'' to hold a summit with Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev. Bush defended the pace of strategic
arms negotiations, and said the United States is ``not going to just
react'' to proposals by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
Bush will see Shevardnadze at the White House on Thursday before the
Soviet's weekend retreat with Secretary of State James A. Baker III
in Wyoming.
   _Said there is no ``hard intelligence evidence'' Colombian drug
lords are targeting his family, but warned any attack would ``just
bring down the total wrath of the American people and the American
government.''
   _Called it too soon after the Tiananmen massacre to resume
``total normalcy'' of U.S.-China relations. Bush said there are
still ``great difficulties'' there, but he defended ties by U.S.
businessmen, including his brother, with Beijing.
   _Declared if the two Germanys decided to reunite, ``I do not
think we should view that as bad for Western interests.''
   _Decried recent racial violence in New York and elsewhere,
saying, ``It says something ugly whenever there's an incident of
that nature.'' But he refused to call it a trend.
   _Predicted not a single governor at next week's education summit
wants the federal government to mandate changes in the nation's
schools.
   But in an earlier address to state legislators, Bush said it may
be time to consider ``radical changes'' because U.S. schools are not
making the grade.
   _Expressed hope that ``the winter will be kind to the
environmental damage'' in Alaska from the Exxon Valdez oil spill. He
said his decision not to visit Alaska on this Western trip was no
indication of a lack of interest in the problem. ``We had an
environmental Vice President Quayle that went,'' he said.
   _Indicated he does not know what ``the final answer'' will be if
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat seeks a U.S.
visa to speak at the United Nations.

   A gunman forced a Moroccan
passenger plane flying across the Western Sahara to land today on
Grand Canary island, officials said.
   The police officer at Gando Airport said the two crew members and
six passengers were allowed to leave the ATR-42 twin-engine
turboprop about two hours after it touched down on this Spanish
archipelago at 2:45 p.m.
   The unidentified gunman gave himself up about six hours after the
aircraft landed, said the officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity. He said no concessions were made to the gunman but had no
information on a possible motive for the hijacking.
   The Royal Air Maroc aircraft was initially identified as a Fokker
by police.
   An official in the Gando Airport control tower, who would not
give his name, said by telephone that the gunman had demanded to
talk with the local representative of the Moroccan national airline
in Las Palmas.
   An attendant at the Royal Air Maroc office in Las Palmas said the
flight had left the eastern town of Smara in the Moroccan-occupied
Western Sahara on a scheduled domestic flight west to the city of El
Aaiun.
   Grand Canary Island is 135 miles west of the Western Sahara in
the Atlantic Ocean.
   The incident occurred prior to the first official visit to Spain
on Sunday by Moroccan King Hassan II.
   Spain abandoned the Western Sahara in 1975, and Hassan sent
thousands of civilians to occupy the area. The Western Sahara is
also claimed by the Polisario National Liberation Front, which has
been waging a desert guerrilla war against the Moroccan army since
1975.

<HEAD>Authorities Arrest Suspect in 1.25-Ton Silver Heist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Montana man has been charged with stealing
1.25 tons of silver shaped like Hershey Kisses from a Nevada mine
where he once worked, authorities said today.
   Sheriff James McIntosh said officials hoped to get arrest
warrants today or Wednesday for two other Montana people wanted in
the Trinity Mine heist Aug. 26.
   John Aiden, 22, of Billings, Mont., was arrested Saturday and
jailed on $105,000 bail on charges of embezzlement and conspiracy,
McIntosh said.
   The $200,000-plus cache of partially processed silver is still
missing.
   The heist occurred when two shotgun-toting masked robbers bound
two mine employees with duct tape and then took more than an hour in
the middle of the night to haul the 1.25 tons of silver into a
waiting pickup.
   The robbers then left spikes in the road to flatten tires of
pursuers.
   Police immediately theorized the heist was commited by people
with inside information.
   Authorities were led to Aiden based on interviews with past and
present mine workers that revealed several small silver thefts at
the mine, McIntosh said.
   ``Once information about some other minor silver thefts began
surfacing, people started getting nervous and talking,'' McIntosh
said.
   Officials gave lie detector tests to past and present employees
of the mine, 90 miles northeast of Reno.

<HEAD>Government Will Need to Provide Long-Term Health Care, Expert Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fledgling market for private long-term care
insurance is growing rapidly but ``inherent limitations'' will halt
the trend long before protection reaches most Americans, says a
leading expert on social insurance.
   In a new book, former Social Security Commissioner Robert M. Ball
says private insurance ``cannot possibly do the job alone'' and
argues for a new government program akin to Social Security to
finance basic long-term care protection for all Americans.
   ``Only a plan that anticipates the needs of society as a whole
and spreads the risk as broadly as possible can meet the need at a
cost that is bearable for each of us,'' Ball writes in the book,
``Because We're All In This Together.''
   Ball said that while long-term care coverage gradually is
improving from the earliest expensive and restrictive policies,
private insurers will be unable to offer adequate protection that
most Americans can afford.
   ``They know exactly what consumers want _ but the dilemma is that
when those wants are met, the cost goes up very considerably,
shrinking the market for the newly improved policies,'' Ball wrote.
   One major problem is that the policies mainly attract the elderly
and others likely to need coverage, leading companies to respond to
the increased risk with high premiums and strict limits on
eligibility, he said.
   Younger would-be buyers are put off by the failure of the
policies to protect beneficiaries against inflation, Ball said.
   Private insurers so far have sold about 1 million long-term care
policies _ most of them in the past two years _ providing limited
coverage to less than 2 percent of the age 50-and-up population,
Ball said.
   While the market is likely to expand dramatically and policies
gradually are getting better, ``inherent limitations will put a stop
to the growth of the long-term care market long before private
insurance can offer real protection for most people,'' he wrote.
   The October issue of Consumer Reports magazine includes a survey
of 24 long-term care plans, and concludes that many companies have
improved their policies by eliminating some coverage restrictions.
The magazine said other companies, however, are denying
policyholders benefits by digging up problems in their medical
histories only after a claim is filed.
   Ball predicted pressure for a better and broader solution will
grow along with public concern about the rising cost of long-term
care _ the bill for one year in a nursing home averaged $25,000 in
1988 _ and the limits of current government coverage.
   ``It's not just a matter of the elderly wanting more protection
for themselves,'' he said. ``Those who are really at risk most are
middle-aged people either needing to bring their parents into their
homes to care for them or facing very high expenses for nursing home
care.''
   Ball served as Social Security commissioner from 1962-1973,
played a key role in the 1983 reform of Social Security and was the
chief administrator of Medicare for its first seven years. He now
chairs the National Academy of Social Insurance, a non-profit group
that promotes research and education about Social Security and
related programs.

<HEAD>Law Student Goes to Jail, Misses Humor in Bank Robbery Note</HEAD>

   A law student spent a night in jail after
handing a bank teller a withdrawal slip on which someone had
scrawled a holdup note.
   Joseph Mulcahey, 23, said he was trying to withdraw $15 Sunday at
the seven-day-a-week bank, unaware of the message on the back of the
slip that read, ``Give me $10,000, I have a gun.''
   The next thing he noticed was five to 10 policemen rushing in the
door.
   ``They told us to get on the floor,'' said Mulcahey. ``I thought
for a minute it was a hostage situation somewhere else in the bank.''
   He was handcuffed, put in a patrol car and told he was being
arrested for attempted bank robbery, said Mulcahey.
   Police released Mulcahey from jail Monday, and he returned to
classes at the University of Illinois law school. Bank officials
called to apologize.
   ``It appears Mr. Mulcahey was the victim of an unfortunate
hoax,'' said Gerald O'Neill, chief executive officer of the Marine
Bank of Champaign-Urbana.
   ``The only one I am unhappy with is the person who wrote that
note,'' Mulcahey said. ``It was a sick joke _ a sad way to get a
laugh.''
   Of his night alone in a jail cell, he said, ``It's pretty
worrisome _ scary.''

<HEAD>EDs: Top 8 grafs new with Baker comments on Soviet aid to Nicaragua.
Picks up 7th graf pvs, The State Department.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today continued Soviet weapons shipments to Nicaragua will be a
priority issue when he meets later this week with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Wyoming.
   ``We're a little disappointed in what's going on down there,''
Baker said, referring to the role of the Soviets and other East bloc
countries in building up the Sandinista military arsenal.
   Baker told a news conference that most of the Soviet weaponry
arrives in Nicaragua via third countries. He added that the Soviets
could put a stop to the practice if they so chose.
   President Bush said Monday in Helena, Mont., that the increased
flow of Soviet bloc arms to Nicaragua indicates ``not a very kind
and gentle approach to this hemisphere.''
   Bush spoke after the State Department said Soviet bloc weapons
deliveries to Nicaragua have continued at a rate of more than one a
week this year, despite a cease-fire dating back 18 months.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev pledged early this year to cut
off weapons deliveries to the Sandinistas. But administration
officials, insisting on anonymity, said Soviet weapons were spotted
last week being loaded onto a Nicaraguan vessel at a port in Cuba.
The equipment has since been delivered to Nicaragua.
   The officials declined comment on a published report that the
weapons consisted of three torpedo-carrying boats and four Mi-24
Hind helicopters.
   The leak of that sensitive information seemed calculated to
influence the upcoming meeting Friday and Saturday between Baker and
Shevardnadze. One purpose of the meeting is to lay the groundwork
for a summit meeting between Gorbachev and President Bush.
   The State Department said Monday that Soviet bloc deliveries to
Nicaragua for the first eight months of this year totaled about $350
million. The equipment weighed an estimated 12,000 tons and was
delivered during 41 ship visits to Nicaraguan ports, the State
Department said, adding that the value of such shipments during all
of 1988 was $515 million.
   Earlier Monday, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler expressed
irritation that overall deliveries to Nicaragua appear to have
increased this year compared with a similar period in 1988.
   Officials had expected a decline since the Sandinista government
and the Nicaraguan resistance reached agreement on a truce in March
1988. Although there have been some violations of the truce, the
level of fighting is down sharply from 1987.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the level of Soviet bloc shipments is well
beyond the legitimate defense needs of Nicaragua.
   ``It is inexplainable to us why the East Bloc feels that it must
provide Nicaragua with even more weapons while a cease-fire is in
effect than it provided the Nicaraguans when they were actively
engaged with Contra forces,'' she said.
   ``The basic pattern in recent years has been transshipment of
Soviet weapons through Cuba,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``This year, the
weapons out of Cuba has increased dramatically.''
   Ms. Tutwiler also said Cuba and Nicaragua continue to supply arms
to the leftist FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador.
   ``The FMLN has come to rely chiefly on Soviet bloc weapons,'' she
said, adding that such activity defies agreements signed by Central
American presidents which call for an end to outside support for
insurgencies in the region.

   The warm waters of the tropics generate almost
daily clouds and showers, a few of which, for reasons not well
understood, grow into some of nature's largest and most dangerous
storms.
   These are storms like Hurricane Hugo, which forecasters say may
hit the United States later this week after battering many Caribbean
Islands; like the cyclones that have killed thousands in Bangladesh,
and like the typhoons that recently took hundreds of lives in China.
   To meteorologists, these are all tropical cyclones, giant
whirling areas of low pressure, winds churning counter-clockwise
around the center and drawing strength from the warm water beneath.
   Why do some low pressure areas peter out and others turn into
mighty storms?
   ``Nobody knows for sure,'' admits meteorologist Rainer Bleck of
the University of Miami.
   But while Bleck says much more study is needed, he was able, in a
telephone interview, to describe how these storms strengthen, live
and die.
   Like tornadoes and the mid-latitude storms than often generate
blizzards in winter, hurricanes are basically regions of low
pressure, the result of rising air.
   But tornadoes, powerful and dangerous as they are, are tiny
compared to hurricanes. A tornado is local, forming from an
individual cloud in 20 minutes to half an hour, Bleck observed.
Hurricanes cover thousands of square miles and take five to six days
to form.
   The sun warms the Earth, concentrating its strength near the
equator. The resultant heated air expands and rises, creating a ring
of low pressure and rain around the globe known as the intertropical
convergence zone.
   Hurricanes form to the north and south of this zone, but due to
the same sort of heating, Bleck explained.
   The sun warms the water, some of which evaporates to wet this
warm rising air, he pointed out. This creates a region of hot, wet
air 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the ocean.
   The warm, moist air rises as it cools, with the water eventually
condensing into clouds that form tropical showers and storms.
   But at this point a new factor is added: condensing water
releases more heat into the air, just as humidity condensing on a
cold glass in summer warms it up.
   So the rising air is warmed again, and that's the ``kicker'' for
the storm, said Bleck. It spurs on the formation of clouds by
increasing the lift of the air, drawing in more moisture from below
to provide additional fuel.
   At the same time, Bleck explained, the clouds begin to turn,
taking some of the Earth's spin as their own, creating the
counter-clockwise turning of the storm.
   This is known as the Coriolis effect, turning the storms
counter-clockwise north of the equator, the opposite way to the
south. It doesn't happen at the equator, but gains strength away
from that line.
   As the winds get closer to the center of the storm they move
faster, just as an ice skater spins faster when she pulls her arms
closer to her body.
   For reasons not well understood, a clear eye forms in the middle
of the storm as it gains strength, Bleck commented.
   Air in this central region is descending, and as a result remains
clear, in contrast to the wall of clouds in the spinning, rising air
around it.
   As long as the warm, wet air from tropical oceans is available,
it fuels the storm engine, Bleck explained, providing rising
moisture that condenses, releasing more heat to drive the fury
onward.
   The storms move little on their own, however, he added.
   Rather, general winds and upper air currents pull them along,
first to the west into the Caribbean or Gulf of Mexico and then
turning north to collide with the United States or follow along the
East coast. The track depends on many things, including the location
of the powerful jet stream thousands of feet above the earth.
   That movement is what leads to the death of the storms, Bleck
went on, cutting off their fuel supply either by moving them over
land or over cooler ocean waters where there is less evaporation to
provide them a supply of water.
   Either way, they then lose strength and break down into a loose
mass of storms, still dangerous but without the power of the
churning hurricane circulation.

   They met in a tattoo parlor and the next night
she accused him of raping her. Then she hired a lawyer for him and
posted his bail, and now they plan to get married.
   Karen Drake now blames pills given to Donald Farmer the night of
the May 24 attack.
   ``It wasn't him,'' Ms. Drake said. ``I've talked to people who
know him. And I know him now and he's not the kind of person who
would do that. It was a drug-induced stupor the way he acted that
night.''
   Assistant District Attorney Colleen Marsini moved Monday to
dismiss charges in Delaware County, just outside Philadelphia,
because Ms. Drake would not testify.
   ``I think he's using her,'' Ms. Marsini said Tuesday.
   Ms. Drake, 25, testified in June that she protested when she was
``pinned down'' and raped by Farmer, 31. But on Monday, she said she
plans to marry him Sept. 30 in a civil ceremony.
   ``My mother is not opposed to our marriage. Both of my parents,
deep down, love Donnie a lot. And I get along very well with his
parents and his two children,'' she said.
   ``Both Donnie and I have a lot in common,'' she said. ``We're
both from Virginia, and we both were born in February.''
   While rape and related offenses were withdrawn, Farmer did plead
guilty to stealing a diamond ring from Ms. Drake and was placed on
two years' probation.
   Defense attorney David Breen said Ms. Drake hired him June 3 to
represent Farmer, two days after Farmer's preliminary hearing on the
rape charges.
   ``She posted bail for him and paid his legal fees. It's the first
time I've ever had a victim pay my fee,'' Breen said.
   Ms. Drake said she met Farmer May 23 at a Philadelphia tattoo
parlor, where she had gone with a friend, and set up a date the next
night.
   ``I have green eyes and he convinced me to get a tattoo on my
shoulder of a green eye with a tear,'' Ms. Drake said.
   During the June 1 preliminary hearing, Ms. Drake testified that
Farmer ``violated me.''
   ``I was scared to death. I couldn't move,'' she testified, saying
he pinned her down.
   ``I was too scared to scream,'' she said during that hearing.
   But Ms. Drake said she and Farmer have lived together since she
posted his bail after she found out her roommate had given him
``pills that caused the attack.''
   Ms. Drake said she also received a call from Farmer's ex-wife,
who said rape was out of character for him.
   ``Immediately, I started to cry. I went with her the next day to
the jail. When Donnie came out he was so shocked. He sat down. He
took my two hands. He didn't remember anything that happened that
night. He held my hand and said: `If I did this to you, I deserve to
die.'''
   Breen said Farmer is undergoing drug rehabilitation.
   Ms. Marsini said the drug Farmer is said to have taken the night
of the alleged attack is a painkiller that toxicologists told her is
a depressant that would not cause a violent reaction.
   ``She's recanted her testimony. She said she created the
situation and caused the problem,'' she said. ``She said he is a
victim of circumstances.
   ``He's playing on her sensitivity. She's very vulnerable.''
   Ms. Drake discounted that evaluation.
   ``That's her job to say that. But that's not the case,'' Ms.
Drake said.
   She said that when the charges were dismissed Monday, Farmer had
a smile ``as big as the sky.''
   ``He said, `I feel like I have 100 pounds off of my shoulder,
Karen. It's over. We can finally have a life.'''

   NASA officials said Tuesday they
would wait a day before deciding whether to move the space shuttle
Atlantis off its launch pad, where it could be threatened by
Hurricane Hugo.
   Space agency officials also put off a decision on whether to
remove a Navy communications satellite from an Atlas-Centaur rocket
on another launch pad.
   Decisions on both missions were expected Tuesday, but were
delayed until Wednesday, when NASA hopes to know more about Hugo's
path.
   Forrest S. McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space Center, said
National Hurricane Center experts told the space officials that the
path of the storm could stay to the east of Cape Canaveral,
``something in excess of 150 miles.''
   Given the unpredictability of hurricanes, ``that's not assured,''
McCartney said.
   NASA had begun preparations to move Atlantis into an assembly
building if it appears that the storm might endanger the craft, he
said.
   The preparations included disconnecting fuel and electrical lines
from Atlantis and moving a giant tracked vehicle into place to carry
the spaceplane to the assembly building. The giant tractor, called a
crawler, moves at a maximum speed of 1 mph and would take at least
six hours to cover the 4.2 miles to the building.
   The Atlantis mission is scheduled for Oct. 12, when a team of
five astronauts is to deploy the $1.4 billion Galileo spacecraft for
its trip to the planet Jupiter. However, the launch could be delayed
if Atlantis is moved.
   Preparations also were made to remove the $65 million
communications satellite from atop the Atlas-Centaur, including
draining the rocket's fuel tanks. Officials said the rocket should
be able to ride out Hugo if the storm struck here.
   The Atlas-Centaur launch had been scheduled for Friday, but has
been delayed until at least Sunday because of the need to drain the
fuel tanks.

   The Kremlin's top human rights official took
issue Tuesday with the U.S. definition of Soviet emigres as
refugees, saying it creates ``friction'' in superpower relations at
a time when his government is allowing record numbers of citizens to
leave.
   Yuri Reshetov, chief of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs
and Cultural Relations at the Soviet foreign ministry, was in
Washington for talks with the State Department preparatory to the
meeting later this week between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Reshetov said the agenda, at the request of the U.S. side, would
include discussion of the cases of several hundred Soviet Jews
denied permission to emigrate. The two sides will also discuss
exchange programs for psychiatrists and law enforcement officers, he
said.
   In an unusual appearance before the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry, Reshetov promised that Soviet Jews would be allowed to
practice their religion freely or leave the country if they want.
   New draft laws on freedom of religion and on emigration seek to
``create the best possibilities for those who want to live in the
Soviet Union. ... But for those who, for some reason, are unhappy
and want to leave, the best civilized conditions should be
created,'' he said.
   In the first eight months of the year, 127,000 Soviets were
allowed to emigrate, he said, about a third of whom came to the
United States as refugees whose expenses were paid by the U.S.
government.
   Speaking to reporters after his speech, Reshetov criticized the
U.S. policy of classifying the Soviet emigres as refugees, saying it
runs ``contrary to the definition of refugee'' accepted by the
international community.
   ``Calling these people refugees creates a considerable,
additional friction'' in U.S.-Soviet relations. ``We are trying to
do our best to solve the situation but then ... we're (portrayed as)
some enemy of mankind from whom all the people are fleeing. It's not
a good thing,'' Reshetov said.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, addressing the
conference before Reshetov, defended the U.S. plan to allot 50,000
of the 125,000 worldwide refugee slots in fiscal year 1990 to Soviet
emigres.
   Despite the unprecedented surge of Soviets allowed to emigrate,
and the recent improvement in the lives of those staying behind,
there are still hundreds denied permission to leave and a wave of
anti-Semitism has surfaced as a result of the glasnost policies of
free expression, Eagleburger said.
   ``Given the history'' of hundreds of years of officially
sanctioned anti-Semitism, ``tens of thousands of Soviet Jews are
turning to the United States,'' Eagleburger said. ``What Soviet Jews
are looking for now is a plcae where they can be themselves. They
are not economic migrants.''
   The United States is ``a victim of our success'' now that the
Soviets have acceded to years of U.S. demands to allow free
emigration, he said. Unfortunately, budget constraints place a limit
on the number of Soviets the United States can absorb and other
countries, such as Australia, Canada and Israel, should share the
burden, he added.
   Eagleburger promised that Baker would bring up U.S. concerns
about anti-Semitism in his meeting with Shevardnadze and would press
for enactment of legislation that will institutionalize the reforms.
   Once such laws are adopted, he said, the United States will lift
certain trade restrictions on the Soviet Union.
   Reshetov said the Kremlin is ``lobbying'' the Supreme Soviet,
which is the Soviet legislature, to consider the draft laws as soon
as possible and at least one may be taken up at the coming session
starting Sept. 25.
   The United States had anticipated the new laws would have been
enacted already, but Reshetov said the Supreme Soviet has other
items higher on its agenda.
   The Soviet official said that even without the laws, the number
of people denied emigration dropped from 11,000 several years ago to
2,000, the teaching of Hebrew and Yiddish is allowed in schools, and
three million Bibles were recently imported into the Soviet Union.
   Reshetov promised that all violators of the ban on anti-Semitic
activity would be punished. The State Department says that despite
the official outlawing of discrimination against Jews, anti-Semitism
among the lower echelons of the bureacracy and among the general
population has increased.

   A judge ordered Pennsylvania to provide $7.56
million to restore services that had been cut or canceled for more
than 4,000 mentally retarded people living at home in Philadelphia.
   Arguing that cuts in the service had put the retarded people at
risk of institutionalization, Commonwealth Court Judge James
Crumlish Jr. directed the city to restore the program and said the
state must pay 90 percent of the costs.
   He gave the state Department of Public Welfare until Sept. 27 to
ask the Legislature to provide the money.
   ``The crying needs of and imminent harm to the individuals at
issue here, unable to speak themselves, cannot be ignored while the
intricacies of the General Assembly budgetary process unfold,''
Crumlish said.
   The services involved teaching and training the retarded in basic
life and social skills, such as feeding and dressing themselves and
learning a simple job. The ruling applied only to retarded people in
Philadelphia.
   The ruling affected only those persons who had received the
rehabilitative services before they were cut July 1. But attorney
David Ferleger said he hoped that the state recognizes it must also
provide such services for every retarded person who requests them.
   ``It is a great victory, not only in Pennsylvania, but for
retarded persons everywhere in this country,'' said Ferleger, who
was representing retarded people awaiting services. ``Other states,
I'm sure, will begin to provide these services as Pennsylvania now
is required to do.''
   The lawsuit, brought by the city and joined by the Philadelphia
Police and Fire Association for Handicapped Children, was the second
the state has lost over the Philadelphia program. During the last
fiscal year, unhappy with deficits in the program, the Legislature
tried to withhold the appropriation, acquiescing only under court
order.
   Vicki Smink, spokeswoman for the state welfare department, said
no decision on an appeal has been made.
   Crumlish said the state had continually refused to provide
sufficient funds in recent years.
   ``This chancellor is deeply troubled by the department's utter
disregard of the needs of mentally retarded persons and their
families who depend on non-residential serevices and programs,'' he
said.
   Crumlish said that while the state was at fault, the city also
was to blame for failing to prevent the cutoff of the program by
seeking additional funds from federal or private sources.

<HEAD>Life Sentence of Secret Police Chief Commuted in Haiti</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The president has commuted the life
sentence of Luc Desir, the former secret police chief who directed
hundreds of torture sessions during the Duvalier regime, a state-run
newspaper said Tuesday.
   Human rights activist Jean-Claude Bajeux immediately denounced
the move, saying: ``The commutation is a gesture of conciliation
toward the Duvalierists. The next step is a full pardon.''
   ``Luc Desir, the man who directed torture sessions with a Bible
in his hand, is a symbol of Duvalierist barbarity,'' Bajeux said in
an interview.
   L'Union newspaper carried an Information Ministry statement
saying that on the first anniversary of his rise to power on Sept.
17, 1988, the president, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, pardoned or
commuted the sentences of 13 people.
   They included Desir, who was sentenced to life at hard labor
after the fall of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986. Desir's
sentence was commuted to 30 years in prison, the Information
Ministry statement said.
   ``The president of the republic has the prerogative to commute a
sentence. If he so wishes, he may even grant full pardon,'' Max
Kernizan, the secretary of the Port-au-Prince Bar Association, told
The Associated Press.
   Kernizan said Desir's trial had been irregular and that he was
``a victim of social pressure.'' Kernizan said Desir's ``victims
could not testify against him, since most of them are dead.''
   One of the few people to be sentenced for crimes committed under
the dictatorship, Desir directed innumerable torture sessions and
executions when he headed the dreaded secret police of Francois
Duvalier, Jean-Claude's father. The number of his victims is not
known, but they are estimated in the hundreds.
   In the 1970s Desir fell out of favor with Jean-Claude Duvalier
and was forced into retirement. He was captured while trying to flee
the country on Feb. 25, 1988. An airport employee alerted a local
radio station of his flight, and thousands of Haitians swarmed the
landing strip to prevent his departure.
   Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier was elected president in 1957
following a year of political turmoil during which six different
governments held power.
   He became president-for-life in 1964 and wielded absolute
political control until his death in 1971, when his son, Jean-Claude
``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, assumed the presidency. On Feb. 7, 1986,
after months of civil disorder, Jean-Claude fled to exile in France.
   Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy led the military junta that assumed power
when Duvalier fled. Presidential elections on Nov. 29, 1987, were
aborted after thugs, protected by soldiers, massacred at least 34
voters at polling stations.
   Civilian Leslie Manigat won army-run elections on Jan. 17, 1988,
and was overthrown by Namphy on June 20, 1988.
   On Sept. 17, 1988, a military coup brought Avril to power.
   In April 1989, loyalist troops foiled a coup attempt and crushed
a rebellion by two army units.
   Haiti comprises the western third of the island of Hispaniola in
the Caribbean Sea, between Puerto Rico and Cuba.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today he hoped to conclude a chemical weapons agreement with the
Soviet Union this weekend and make headway on other arms control
fronts.
   Baker, in his first Washington news conference in eight months in
his job, sought to reverse growing criticism in Congress and
elsewhere of the cautious approach President Bush is taking in
response to foreign policy initiatives from Moscow.
   He accused the Senate's Democratic leader of playing politics
with the issue.
   Last week, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who
will meet with Baker in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday and Saturday,
accused the administration of ``timidity'' on arms control issues.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, said Monday
that the administration had failed to encourage change in the
Eastern bloc and was ``feeling almost nostalgic about the Cold War.''
   Baker replied today: ``The president is rocking along with a 70
percent approval rating in foreign policy. And if I were the Senate
majority leader I might have something like that to say, too.''
   And yet, in several of his replies to questions, Baker stressed
the cautious stance taken by the administration toward Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would be maintained.
   ``I hope we have been approaching this relationship with a proper
degree of prudence,'' he said.
   In this regard, Baker lowered expectations that he would set a
date with Shevardnadze for a summit meeting between Bush and
Gorbachev. He said only that the subject would be thoroughly
discussed at Jackson Hole.
   Baker said any increases in U.S. assistance to Poland and
Hungary, which are veering away from a Marxist economy, depended on
the changes undertaken in the two East European countries. ``We
shouldn't be mistaken'' and think U.S. aid could overcome their
problems, he said.
   And, Baker said, it was the Soviets' ``turn to move'' on reducing
troops and non-nuclear armaments in Europe.
   On negotiating arms control with Moscow, Baker said, ``we have to
be careful not to become frantic ....''
   However, Baker said he would propose to Shevardnadze ways to
break a 15-year impasse on verifying the size of U.S. and Soviet
underground nuclear tests.
   In addition, he said, ``We have, I think, a reasonable shot at an
agreement to exchange data on chemical stocks, which I think is a
first practical step toward achieving real controls and eventually a
total ban.''
   On another arms control front, Baker said the administration no
longer would seek a ban on U.S. and Soviet long-range mobile
missiles. He urged Congress to provide funds for development of the
single-warhead Midgetman.
   The move is of limited significance. The Reagan administration
had taken the position it favored a ban only if the elimination of
all U.S. and Soviet mobile missiles could be verified, and no
headway was made on the issue in negotiations in Geneva.
   Baker said continued Soviet weapons shipments to leftist
Nicaragua will be a priority issue in his discussions with
Shevardnadze.
   ``We're a little disappointed in what's going on down there,''
Baker said, referring to the role of the Soviets and other East bloc
countries in building up the Sandinistas' military arsenal.
   He said most of the Soviet weaponry arrives in Nicaragua via
third countries and the Soviets could put a stop to the practice if
they so chose.

<HEAD>Guard Dogs, Once a Novelty, Shown to Protect Sheep</HEAD>

   A survey of sheep ranchers shows that flocks
are less likely to be attacked by coyotes, wild dogs and other
predators if a burly guard dog is on watch, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   The department's Agricultural Research Service said that
scientists began studying guard dogs 10 years ago at the U.S. Sheep
Experiment Station in Dubois, Idaho.
   ``At that time, the dogs were considered a novelty,'' Jeffrey S.
Green, a wildlife biologist at the station, said in a report by the
agency. ``Livestock producers who had guard dogs were thought to be
foolish, brave, desperate or a combination of all three. Today, much
of the skepticism is gone.''
   Green and his colleagues sent out 1,000 questionnaires to
ranchers and farmers who rely on the dogs to safeguard sheep, cattle
and goats.
   More than 80 percent of the 399 who responded said a guard dog
was well worth its initial cost of about $500, plus the dollar or
two a day it takes to feed them, Green reported.
   The dogs weight 100 to 120 pounds and come from several breeds _
Great Pyerenees, Komondor, Akbash and Anatolian. Green estimates
that over the last decade as many as 8,000 of the guard dogs have
been used on 4,000 ranches throughout the United States and Canada.

   A state appeals court today stripped New Zealand
of the America's Cup and gave the trophy back to the San Diego Yacht
Club.
   The Supreme Court's Appellate Division reversed a lower court
ruling April 7 that stripped San Diego of yacht racing's most
coveted prize for using a catamaran, or two-hull vessel, instead of
a single-hull boat in winning a 1988 match.
   The appeals court said that the catamaran was legal and that the
San Diego Club is entitled to the America's Cup.
   Supreme Court Justice Carmen Ciparick had ruled in April that the
best-of-three race between the New Zealand, a yacht about 90 feet at
the water line sailed by the Mercury Bay Boating Club, and the Stars
and Stripes, a 60-foot catamaran sailed by the San Diego group, was
a ``gross mismatch'' and unfair.
   Ciparick found that competing vessels must be ``somewhat evenly
matched'' in America's Cup competition and that using a lighter,
faster catamaran violated the spirit of the international
competition.
   But in its 4-1 decision today the appeals court said Ciparick had
on her own pronounced a rule that is neither expressed nor implied
in the Deed of Gift, the 102-year-old document that governs the race.
   The squabbling began in July 1987 when Auckland businessman
Michael Fay, on behalf of the Mercury Bay Boating Club, ignored
modern America's Cup tradition and demanded a one-on-one match with
a San Diego defender.
   Fay wanted the race held within one year rather than the usual
three to four; he wanted a one-on-one race instead of the usual
elimination matches, and he wanted to compete in a boat more than 90
feet long at the water line instead of the usual yachts that are
about 45 feet at the water line.
   San Diego rejected the challenge, but Fay went to court. When San
Diego was ordered to accept the challenge, it also went to an
unconventional boat, the speedy catamaran.
   The San Diego Yacht Club became trustee of the Cup in 1987 after
skipper Dennis Conner sailed the 12-meter yacht Stars &amp; Stripes to
victory over the Australian defender, Kookaburra III, in waters off
Fremantle, Australia.
   The victory returned the Cup to America after Conner's 1983 loss
to the Australians ended a 132-year U.S. winning streak.

   Here are dates of significant events in the

   June 1984 _ Ten Polish nuns receive permission from the Polish
government to turn a former Nazi storehouse on the Auschwitz death
camp perimeter into a convent. They move in shortly thereafter.
   Feb. 22, 1987 _ Eighteen Jewish and Roman Catholic leaders sign
agreement in Geneva to move the convent by 1989 to an interfaith
prayer and education center to be located further from the site.
   Feb. 22, 1989 _ Deadline passes and nuns remain in the convent.
   July 14, 1989 _ An American rabbi and six other Jews stage a
five-hour protest and are forcibly removed by workers after trying
to scale a convent wall.
   Aug. 10, 1989 _ Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow, whose
diocese includes the convent, says the 1987 agreement to move the
nuns is being abrogated because of the ``aggressive'' atmosphere
surrounding the controversy.
   Aug. 26, 1989 _ Polish primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp calls a
Jewish request to relocate the convent ``offensive'' to Poles and
makes other remarks that provoke charges of anti-Semitism by critics.
   Sept. 19, 1989 _ The Vatican says the convent should be moved to
another site and that it would help finance the construction of an
interfaith prayer center for the nuns to live in.

   Television producer David Nuell is leaving the
syndicated show ``Entertainment Tonight'' to rejoin NBC, with duties
in news, sports and entertainment, network officials said Tuesday.
   In January, Nuell will become senior executive producer of the
morning news program ``Today.'' Where that leaves Marty Ryan, the
current job-holder, has not been determined.
   Nuell worked in various capacities at NBC before he became
executive producer of ``Entertainment Tonight'' in 1986. He spent 15
years as an executive at WRC-TV, the NBC-owned station in
Washington, D.C.
   Besides his work at ``Today,'' Nuell will develop a sports
program as part of the network's daily coverage of the 1992 Summer
Olympics in Barcelona. He also will head development of a daytime
series, the nature of which has not been revealed.
   His hiring was jointly announced by NBC Entertainment president
Brandon Tartikoff, NBC News president Michael Gartner, and NBC
Sports president Dick Ebersol.
   ``David brings the type of depth, imagination, talent and range
that is essential if NBC is to thrive and prosper in the
increasingly competitive television environment of the 1990s,'' they
said.
   Nuell will be the second ``Entertainment Tonight'' executive
producer to take over a network morning show in three yea-host Jane Pauley.
   ``Today'' for several years usually has led in the morning-show
ratings race, and has been first in ratings for 14 of the last 15
weeks over ABC's rival ``Good Morning America,'' according to a
spokesman for ``Today.''
   Peggy Hubble, an NBC News spokeswoman, said the ratings victories
had been close ones, and that Nuell's hiring was part of a move to
make certain ``Today'' continues its ratings leadership.

   What do you give to the man who REALLY has
everything? In billionaire developer Donald Trump's case, it's his
own television program _ ``Trump Card,'' a syndicated game show set
to debut next year.
   ``I think it will be tremendously successful. We're trading on
the glamour of the Trump Castle, the Trump Princess,'' Trump said
Tuesday at a news conference _ in his Trump Tower.
   ``The Trump name has never been hotter,'' he said, mentioning _
repeatedly _the successes of his Trump Shuttle air service, his
Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., and his
book ``Trump: The Art of the Deal.'' He said his share of the show's
profits will go to charity.
   The show, to be filmed at the Trump Castle Hotel and Casino, will
feature three contestants trying to answer questions and thereby
fill in their ``Trump Card'' _ a box of 15 squares. Prize money has
not yet been determined, said Lorimar Television President David E.
Salzman.
   The show's host has not been named yet either, although Trump
ruled out casino competitor and game show guru Merv Griffin, who
outbid Trump for control of the Resorts International hotel-casino
company, which has been losing money.
   ``Merv is a friend of mine. Merv is a good guy. He has good game
shows. I just happen to have better casinos,'' Trump said.

keep an entertainer working forever, but when the tour ends, so will
her dancing.
   ``I'm kicking my last leg,'' Miss Reynolds, 57, said in a recent

`Molly Brown' is great dancing.''
   Miss Reynolds received an Oscar nomination for her title role in

time she has appeared in the 2{-hour original stage version.
   ``I wonder why I wanted to work this hard. I have questions about

   A 23-year-old actress from Muncie with just
one off-off-Broadway production on her resume has landed the female
lead opposite Denzel Washington in Spike Lee's newest movie, ``A
Love Supreme.''
   ``They wanted an unknown _ that was in my favor,'' said Cindy
Williams. ``They also wanted someone with an accent, someone that
the audience would know immediately was not from New York, so my
Hoosier accent helped.''
   Williams went through multiple auditions and telephone
conversations with Lee, director of ``Do the Right Thing,'' before
she was cast as a nightclub singer in the film that goes into
production Sept. 25.
   She will use the professional name ``Cynda Williams'' to avoid
confusion with the Cindy Williams who starred in ``Laverne and
Shirley.''

   Miss West Virginia should resign
because of her complaint that Miss America pageant finalists were
chosen on political standards, not on their talents, the president
of the state NAACP says.
   But Lisa Bittinger's publicist says her comments were blown out
of proportion.
   ``The comments were racist at best,'' said James Tolbert,
president of the West Virginia branch of the NAACP.
   The new Miss America, Debbye Turner of Missouri, is the third
black to be crowned in the history of the contest.
   Bittinger, a junior at Fairmont State College, commented Sunday
when she returned after the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City,
N.J.
   Asked how she felt at not winning, she replied: ``If it's
political, it's not my fault. If you look at the top 10, it's quite
obvious.
   ``It was one black, one Korean, one Japanese, one hearing
impaired, one kidney transplant, and of course, Texas and Florida
were part of the top 10. It just makes you wonder.''
   Bittinger said Monday that she didn't mean her remarks to be
derogatory.
   ``It's just being blown way out of proportion,'' said Jody Bice,
Bittinger's traveling companion and business manager. ``She did not
mean it in a derogatory way. She only said what she felt. Some
people are taking it all wrong.''

<TEXT>
   The widely publicized flood of East German refugees
to the West has energized the fledgling pro-democracy movement they
left behind, giving it a new boldness to challenge East Germany's
hard-line government.
   Just two weeks after its creation, a dissident group called Neues
Forum says its numbers have swelled from 30 founders to more than
1,500 supporters nationwide.
   Neues Forum says it has also received inquiries from a number of
low-level Communist Party members and on Tuesday asked the
government to legalize it.
   ``For too long, people have only dared to express their hopes in
places like bars, where it's safe. It's time we start talking about
these things out in the open,'' said 27-year-old Klaus, a group
member who asked that his last name not be used because of possible
police reprisals.
   Erich Honecker's hard-line Communist government staunchly rejects
the kinds of reforms under way in the Soviet Union, Hungary and
Poland, saying there is no need for them in East Germany.
   Neues Forum, which means New Forum, is demanding that East
Germany's rulers heed the call for reforms and that the group be
legalized by the government.
   ``We want to keep whatever has been proven, but at the same time
create room for renewal,'' says the group's founding charter.
   At one founding member's East Berlin apartment, the telephone
rang frequently as people called seeking information about Neues
Forum. Several East Berliners knocked on the door with the same
request.
   ``The response has far exceeded our expectations,'' said Rolf
Henrich, another founding member of Neues Forum who was kicked out
of the Communist Party earlier this year for criticizing the
government.
   Other new pro-democracy groups are springing up as well, with a
meeting of activists from across East Germany tentatively planned
for sometime next month.
   It's not clear how many people belong to such groups and how many
have expressed interest.
   West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper Tuesday quoted
East Berlin Lutheran Rev. Rainer Eppelmann as saying in an interview
that there are ``about 500 pro-democracy church groups with
memberships ranging from 10 to 100.''
   The Citizens' Movement for Democracy Now was founded last week by
12 people, including Lutheran Church pastors, scientists and human
rights activists. The group says it now has a few hundred members.
Another pro-reform group, Liste 2, was recently founded in Dresden.
   Neues Forum says the exodus of thousands of East Germans to the
West should be a signal to Communist authorities that something must
be done soon about widespread discontent and despair among East
German citizens.
   ``People who contact us say they have faced the question whether
to also leave, or stay and try to get something done,'' one of the
group's founders, East German artist Baerbel Bohley, said on West
German ARD television Monday.
   Among those making contact with Neues Forum are disillusioned
Communist Party members, the group's leaders say.
   It is believed there is a growing desire among lower party
echelons for political and economic reforms but that people at the
top refuse to listen.
   ``People contact us saying they have directed a (state-owned)
business for 20 years and have ideas for economic changes. They say
that for a long time they have made suggestions to the Central
Committee, but there was simply no reply,'' Ms. Bohley said.
   Ms. Bohley was not interviewed by ARD. Instead, ARD filmed her
while she was talking on the telephone with a reporter calling from
a West German radio station. ARD said it was not permitted by state
authorities to interview Ms. Bohley in East Berlin.
   Neues Forum on Tuesday submitted official applications to
Communist authorities in districts across East Germany seeking to be
legalized.
   The group's chances for official approval do not look promising.
   About 100 activists, including Neues Forum members, were arrested
after a prayer service at Leipzig's Nikolai church on Monday night.
   They included Michael Arnold, Leipzig coordinator for Neues
Forum. Arnold and the others were released the next afternoon.
   But activists say they will keep up their efforts for change
whether Neues Forum is legalized or not, saying the only alternative
for East Germans is continued frustration and despair.
   Henrich, one of the Neues Forum founders, told a gathering of
activists in East Berlin on Monday night that a congress of all
pro-democracy groups is planned for sometime next month to
``formulate common goals.''
   ``Everyone agrees on one thing. Things cannot go on as they are
in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany),'' he said.
   Nearly 17,000 people have fled East Germany since Sept. 10, when
Hungary defied its hard-line Warsaw Pact ally and orchestrated a
mass migration to the West by East Germans vacationing in Hungary.

<TEXT>
   A coalition of pro-choice lawmakers
Tuesday proposed legislation designed to strengthen women's rights
to abortion in Pennsylvania and to preempt a planned attempt to
toughen existing laws restricting abortion.
   Pennsylvania is widely viewed as a key battleground state
following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in July that gave states
more leeway in addressing the abortion issue. Historically, the
state General Assembly has overwhelmingly approved bills restricting
abortions, but many of the provisions have been struck down in court.
   The new nine-bill package includes measures calling for a state
constitutional amendment giving women the right to an abortion,
restoring state-subsidized funding for all ``medically necessary''
abortions, and wiping out an existing law requiring rape and incest
victims to file a police report before receiving subsidized
abortions.
   The centerpiece bill, sponsored by state Rep. Karen Ritter, says
government should not interfere with ``a woman's personal choice to
commence, prevent or continue a pregnancy or have an abortion''
before the fetus is viable.
   The proposal mirrors existing law in saying an abortion on a
viable fetus is allowed only if the mother's life or health is
threatened by the pregnancy. Under the proposal, a fetus is
considered viable if the woman's doctor rules there is ``a
reasonable likelihood of sustained survival ... outside the woman's
uterus.''
   In an attempt to placate some abortion opponents, Ms. Ritter said
the bill would also require doctors to ask teen-age patients to
notify at least one parent before having an abortion. If that is not
feasible, the doctor must recommend that the teen-ager discuss the
matter with another relative, school counselor or another adult.
   ``This bill represents mainstream America, and the opinion of an
overwhelming majority of Pennsylvania citizens as well, that
government has no business invading the privacy of people's lives,''
Ms. Ritter said at a news conference.
   The bills are scheduled to be introduced simultaneously in the
House and Senate on Oct. 2. Abortion foes, led by state Rep. Stephen
Freind, are scheduled to introduce legislation outlining further
restrictions on Oct. 3.
   This is the first attempt in several years to offer an organized
pro-choice package of bills. Ms. Ritter and others acknowledged the
proposals would face tough opposition in both chambers, but she said
the public generally supports a woman's right to an abortion, even
though many legislators do not.
   Freind said the parental notification in Ms. Ritter's bill
weakens what already is in Pennsylvania law but is under court
challenge. The law now requires that a parent be notified or the
minor obtain a court order before having an abortion.
   He also said pro-choice advocates want to restore the pre-1985
situation of ``tax-funded birth control by abortion on demand. That
won't happen.''
   Legislation enacted in the early 1980s and upheld by the courts
after years of legal battles restricted Medicaid funding for
abortions except in cases of rape or incest or when the mother's
life was at stake.
   Abortion already is an issue in the 1990 governor's race. Likely
GOP nominee Barbara Hafer is pro-choice. Incumbent Democrat Robert
P. Casey opposes abortion.
   Freind has said his bills will deal with such issues as requiring
spousal notification before an abortion is performed and banning
so-called sex-selection abortions.
   He said he didn't regard the pro-choice announcement as an
attempt to upstage his efforts.
   ``Nobody takes us out of our game plan,'' he said. ``This is one
more battle that has to be won ... It's one more battle that will be
won and take us one step closer to the day when the sanctity of all
human life is protected in Pennsylvania.''

<HEAD>Study: AIDS Patients Take Risks by Combining Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS patients in San Francisco are taking an
average of five drugs and unapproved treatments without telling
their doctors, posing a risk of potentially fatal drug interactions,
a survey has found.
   One patient admitted using 25 treatments, said Dr. Ruth
Greenblatt of the University of California, San Francisco. She
described her findings Tuesday at a meeting of the American Society
for Microbiology.
   ``There is a significant minority who have a background belief
that new experimental drugs may have more benefit than drugs already
available,'' she said.
   The hidden use of AIDS drugs also makes it difficult for
scientists to determine which drugs have toxic side effects.
   Patients receiving only the recommended, approved treatments for
infection with the AIDS virus or HIV would normally not be receiving
more than one or two drugs unless they were very sick. Then they
might be given up to five drugs, Greenblatt said.
   Dr. Kenneth Dunnigan, medical director of a city-supported AIDS
clinic in San Francisco, said he was a bit surprised at how many
drugs patients were taking, but said he was ``fully supportive of
people with HIV using alternative therapies.''
   ``I also believe care is difficult if we only have bits and
pieces of information'' about what patients are taking, Dunnigan
said. He is on the board of the Community Research Alliance, a San
Francisco group studying alternative treatments.
   Greenblatt's survey found that 37 percent of the patients were
getting prescriptions from a second doctor and 28 percent were using
treatments not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
   ``The use of FDA-unapproved treatments was common and increased
with the severity of illness,'' Greenblatt said.
   The only government-approved drug to treat AIDS is AZT. Several
other drugs are available for the treatment of AIDS-related
infections.
   The alternative treatments most widely used by patients in the
survey included megadoses of vitamin C and the unapproved AIDS drugs
AL721 and dextran sulfate. One patient was getting injections of
fetal sheep blood.
   Other doctors familiar with the survey were surprised at how many
drugs patients were getting from other doctors and alternative
sources, such as community-organized trials of unapproved drugs.
   AIDS patients have more toxic drug reactions than do other
patients, Greenblatt said. Because of the clandestine use of
multiple drugs, ``it can be hard to sort out which medications are
causing these toxicities,'' she said.
   The hidden use of approved and unapproved AIDS drugs is
complicating scientific research, because subjects in the studies
are not disclosing their use of other drugs, Dunnigan said.
   In some cases, disclosing that use might result in their being
dropped from the study, losing access to medical care associated
with the study, he said.
   ``There are two sides,'' he said. ``From the physician's point of
view, in order to get good data there needs to be some rigor in how
the drugs are used. But from a client's point of view, there's so
little that can be done. And the clock keeps ticking.''
   Greenblatt said patients who use unapproved treatments are not
discharged from her clinic, but are advised to tell their doctors
what drugs they are taking.
   ``I don't think you can ask people to not take something they
think will help them,'' Greenblatt said. ``That's my personal
opinion. But you can ask them to let you know.''
   The key to avoiding problems is a partnership between doctors and
their patients, Dunnigan said, in which patients feel free to
disclose which drugs they're taking.
   ``Hopefully that agreement would be made before therapy is
initiated,'' he said.
   The survey, which began last fall and will continue for two more
years, consists of 30-minute to 60-minute interviews with each
patient every three months. Patients are asked about their use of
various medical services in addition to drug use, Greenblatt said.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Will Request to Have House Leveled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT W. TROTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman's dying wish to leave behind an
unimpeded view of the shore by having her house leveled was denied
Tuesday by a judge who called the will request a waste of money.
   Superior Court Judge Thomas Needham threw out a portion of Ethel
Turner's will that instructed the city of Cranston to raze the old
home and use the property as a right of way to Providence River.
   ``To destroy the house would be to commit substantial waste of
this estate,'' Needham said. ``I declare the provision is void as
being contrary to public policy.''
   Rhode Island Hospital Trust, executor of the woman's estate, did
not want the nine-room home razed and challenged the will in June,
when Needham heard arguments from lawyers.
   In 1973, the Victorian-Queen Anne home built in the 1890s was
made a national historic site, along with the rest of the
neighborhood. Neighbors and the city also opposed leveling the house
and filling in the basement as requested in the will.
   Ms. Turner died in April 1986 at age 86. The will left $5,000 to
the city to maintain the right of way. The Providence River leads to
Narragansett Bay.
   Needham said the area would not be served by tearing down the
house, among $1.4 million in assets left by the woman. Her wealth
was mostly in stocks and bonds.
   David Riedel, Hospital Trust's lawyer, said the ruling ``made a
lot of sense.''
   He added: ``No one wants to see a nice house destroyed. But on
the other hand, some people (would feel) you ought to be able to do
whatever you want in the will.''
   Needham ruled the home should be sold. He said an appeal of his
decision is unlikely. The exact value of the house is unknown, but
real estate agents said waterfront homes in the area were selling
for $400,000 and more.

<HEAD>Alabama Treatment Program Accepts DC Drug Addicts at No Cost</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two drug addicts from the District of Columbia
have been admitted to a donated treatment program in Alabama that
could be a model for programs elsewhere in the nation, government
and private drug abuse officials announced Tuesday.
   ``This effort has brought a cooperative spirit to the district
that could well be recreated in communities across the nation,''
said Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, deputy director for demand reduction in
the Office of National Drug Control Policy. ``We need everybody to
follow this example of private and public cooperation to win this
war.''
   The two unidentified adult men, who left Washington last
Wednesday to be admitted to a facility of the Bradford Group in
Birmingham, Ala., are the first of 70 that the private drug and
alcohol treatment organization has said it will accept in the first
year of its new program.
   Bradford, a company operated for profit, has had a policy of
making unused beds available to uninsured addicts in the Birmingham
area and announced on May 23 that it would extend the program to the
nation's capital.
   Patients for the treatment slots are selected by a committee of
private citizens working under auspices of the Washington Area
Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse.
   Joseph L. Wright, executive director of the council, said the
patients must be residents of the district, must have a
``significant person'' to help them with decisions, must have no
criminal charges pending against them although they may have
criminal records, must certify that no insurance company or third
party will pay for the cost and must not have been through a drug
treatment program before.
   Wright said there is a ``considerable waiting list,'' although he
said he did not know the number waiting.
   Chip Burson, a spokesman for Bradford, said most patients would
stay from 30 to 45 days.
   After that, Wright said, they are to receive two years of
follow-up treatment in the district, which they agree to pay for
through some form of community service.
   Wright said the council is negotiating with three treatment
groups in the Washington suburbs that have approached it about
similar programs.

   Hurricanes that ravage the Caribbean tend to spin into the Gulf
of Mexico or north into the Atlantic along the east coast of the
United States. Here is a list of some of the worst storms that, like
Hugo, have threatened the eastern seaboard:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Sept. 12-17, 1928 _ Called the Lake Okeechobee hurricane, this
storm killed 5,000 people in the Caribbean before moving into
Florida. Lake Okeechobee, Florida's largest lake, whipped by 160 mph
winds, overflowed into populated areas, killing 1,836 more people.
   Sept. 21, 1938 _ This fast-moving storm attacked with little
warning, hitting Cape Hatteras, N.C., early in the morning. With
winds clocked at more than 180 mph, it rampaged northward along the
coast into New England, killing more than 600 people across seven
states and destroying over 20,000 buildings.
   Sept. 12-16, 1944 _ When this storm struck from North Carolina to
New England, 40 people were killed on land, and some 350 drowned
when the high winds and seas devastated wartime shipping.
   CAROL: Aug. 30, 1954 _ This storm left a trail of 68 dead from
Cape Hatteras to Quebec. Wind gusts of 135 mph ripped off the
steeple of Boston's Old North Church, where lanterns were hung to
signal Paul Revere's famous ride.
   HAZEL: Oct. 12-13, 1954 _ Hazel hit North and South Carolina
after killing hundreds in Haiti. A total of 347 people died, 95 of
them in the United States.
   CONNIE: Aug. 12-13, 1955 _ Hurricane Connie struck North
Carolina, veered northward into Virginia and Maryland, and finally
moved out to sea after brushing Long Island. Forty-three people died
in the United States.
   DIANE: Aug. 18-19, 1955 _ Diane struck a week after Connie and
although it was a weaker storm, killed 184 people, dumping heavy
rains and causing extensive flooding from North Carolina to New
England.
   DONNA: Sept. 4-12, 1960 _ Hurricane Donna crossed the Florida
Keys, savaged North Carolina, bounced back to sea, and then turned
again to hit New York City with the strongest winds the city had
ever experienced. Manhattan was inundated with 10-foot tides. An
estimated 148 people died.
   DAVID: Aug. 30-Sept. 13, 1979 _ Traveling from the Dominican
Republic to Florida up to eastern Canada, Hurricane David killed
1,200 people, 19 of them in the United States.
   GLORIA: Sept. 16-27, 1985 _ Gloria struck the mid-Atlantic coast,
came ashore on Long Island, N.Y., and swept through New England to
Canada. More than 200,000 people in the nation's most populated area
were evacuated in preparation for what was billed as ``the storm of
the century.'' However Gloria came ashore at low tide with
diminished winds, so damage was moderate and only two deaths were
attributed to the storm.

<TEXT>
   The season premiere of ABC's ``Roseanne'' took
a commanding lead in the A.C. Nielsen Co. television ratings and
pulled the new comedy series ``Chicken Soup'' into second place for
the week ended Sept. 17.
   NBC won the week, by less than one ratings point over ABC, and
became the first network to win every week of a broadcast year from
one season premiere to another. The week CBS broadcast the
miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' was a tie between NBC and CBS. In all,
NBC has been first for the past 65 weeks.
   ``Roseanne'' was five ratings points ahead of ``Chicken Soup''
and captured 40 percent of the audience.
   NBC's coverage of ``The Miss America Pageant'' was third, and
that network's preview of ``Sister Kate'' was fifth after a rerun of
its ``Golden Girls.'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' back with new shows, was
sixth.
   ABC's Monday Night Football game between the New York Giants and
the Washington Redskins was seventh. Its Tuesday preview of the new
fall drama ``Life Goes On'' was tenth. A Friday preview of the same
episode tied for 28th place.
   Reruns of NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' were eighth and
ninth.
   ABC's ``Chicken Soup,'' which follows ``Roseanne,'' stars Jackie
Mason as a former pajama salesman who takes a new job at a community
center. It had been forecast as the biggest hit of the new season.
   Although all three networks previewed some shows last week, the
season officially began Monday.
   ``The Emmy Awards Show'' on Fox Broadcasting landed in 37th
place. Nineteen percent of the audience watched the Sunday night
show. The pre-awards show on the arrival of the stars was 68th. The
Emmys pre-empted Fox's highest-rated shows, including ``Married ...
With Children.''
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average
rating of 12.4. ABC was second with 11.8 and CBS third with 11.0.
NBC had an average rating of 14.3 for the past 52-week period, ABC
was second with 11.6 and CBS third with 11.5.
   The rating is the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes
with television in the United States. The share is the percentage of
sets in use.
   CBS' preview of ``Wolf'' tied for 17th place with the rerun of an
NBC ``Perry Mason'' movie. ABC's ``Just the 10 of Us'' preview tied
for 26th place with a rerun of NBC's ``L.A. Law.'' A preview of
ABC's ``Homeroom'' was 64th.
   CBS' ``Paradise,'' continuing its new season with another show
featuring Hugh O'Brian reprising his role as Wyatt Earp, was 49th.
The week before a special season premiere with O'Brian and Gene
Barry as Bat Masterson was ninth. NBC threw in a ``Golden Girls''
special against it for a 30th place finish.
   Fox's special broadcast of the rock opera ``Tommy'' starring The
Who was 70th.
   ``The CBS Evening News'' was the top-rated newscast and ABC fell
to third place. CBS had a rating of 9.4, NBC was second with 9.0 and
ABC had 8.9. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was pre-empted or not
broadcast on 18 West Coast stations Monday because of the return of
``Monday Night Football.''
   Here are the five bottom network shows: ABC's ``Fall Preview''
and ABC News' ``Survival Stories: Growing Up, Down and Out,'' tied;
ABC's ``Homeroom'' preview; NBC's ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow;''
and CBS' ``Hot Paint.''

   A man accused of killing his girlfriend, then
dismembering and boiling some of her remains, calmly told
investigators where to find a bucket filled with her body parts,
detectives said Tuesday.
   Daniel Rakowitz, 28, awaited arraignment later Tuesday on a
charge of murdering Swiss dancer Monika Beerle, said police Sgt.
John Clifford, a department spokesman.
   The victim's remains, reduced to a skull and bones left in a
five-gallon bucket, were found in the baggage claim of the Port
Authority bus terminal and handed over to the medical examiner. No
findings were expected before Wednesday.
   Miss Beerle, 26, came to New York last year from St. Gallen,
Switzerland, to study with the Martha Graham School of Contemporary
Dance and took up residence in east Greenwich Village.
   Rakowitz, a short-order cook who drifted from job to job, moved
in with Miss Beerle about two months ago and they shared the
apartment with another woman, said Deputy Chief Ronald Fenrich,
commander of Manhattan detectives.
   He declined to say where the other woman was or what she saw.
   When Miss Beerle decided to break off with Rakowitz and told him
to leave on Aug. 19, Rakowitz beat and stabbed her to death, then
worked for the next week at disposing of the body, Fenrich said.
   He boiled the parts to separate flesh from bone and ``flushed the
skin down the toilet,'' Clifford said. Word of the grisly killing
got around the neighborhood and eventually reached police, Fenrich
said.
   One of Rakowitz's neighbors said Rakowitz had bragged that he
would kill his girlfriend.
   ``He said, `Charlie Manson has nothing on me,''' said the
neighbor, who asked not to be identified.
   Rakowitz was arrested Monday at a restaurant in Brooklyn where he
had been working for two days.
   ``He was calm, not excited, didn't appear to be under stress, did
not offer any resistance and came voluntarily,'' Fenrich said. ``His
statement led us to the baggage check-in.''
   Rakowitz has a prior conviction for selling marijuana, Fenrich
said.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Tuesday won an
opportunity to revamp the Communist Party by scheduling a party
congress next year that could hasten the pace of economic reforms
and change the Kremlin leadership.
   Gorbachev also made an emotional plea for calm among ethnic
groups in the increasingly restive Caucasus and Baltic republics.
``We cannot allow anarchy, much less bloodshed,'' he said on state
television.
   He also condemned secessionist movements in the Baltics and
Georgia, saying people demanding independence are ``demagogues.''
   ``Currently, the work of party bodies and organizations is in
many ways fettered by old structures and outdated rules and
instructions,'' Gorbachev told the party's 251-member Central
Committee, in obtaining its approval for moving up the date of the
party meeting to October 1990.
   The congress, with 5,000 delegates, theoretically is the party's
most powerful body. It can set broad policy guidelines, and it is
the only body that can promote Communists to the Central Committee,
which makes major decisions in the five years between congresses.
   Historically, the congress also sets the five-year plan for the
economy. By party rules, the next congress _ the 28th in the party's
history _ must be held by early 1991. Moving up the date will allow
Gorbachev to make economic reforms sooner and to increase the number
of supporters on the Central Committee.
   The move came at a closed meeting of the Central Committee
dedicated to solving the nation's ethnic disputes, which have led to
more than 200 deaths in the past 19 months and threaten Soviet
stability and unity.
   In remarks later shown on state television, Gorbachev said
nationalist disputes must be resolved peacefully. He rejected
demands for boundary changes between the country's 15 republics. He
said such changes cannot solve conflicts when 60 million people, or
almost one-fifth of the Soviet population of 285 million, live
outside their native territories.
   Gorbachev also used the speech to denounce critics on both the
right and left who assail his reform campaign, known as
``perestroika'' or restructuring.
   ``They are telling us that we can't solve the country's problems
without moving to capitalism,'' he said. ``Another theme, coming
from the right, is that everything we suggest, the policy of
perestroika, is an action the West succeeded in planting, in forcing
on us. That's rubbish!''
   The last party congress was held in February 1986, less than a
year after Gorbachev took power. He succeeded in replacing 41
percent of the voting members of the Central Committee. Appointees
of former President Leonid I. Brezhnev, however, remained a
significant force.
   In April, another 83 of the then 301 voting members resigned, and
a number of candidate members were promoted to full membership,
entitling them to vote on issues brought before the body.
   The congress agenda approved Tuesday includes a report on the
progress of Gorbachev's economic, social and political reforms, a
review of party rules and the election of new governing bodies _
presumably including the Central Committee itself and the 12-member
Politburo.
   Gorbachev, 58, expressed concern that the party is lagging behind
the political reforms he has set in motion, including the shift of
more power to elected government bodies. ``Real life, the
reconstruction forces are going at such a rhythm that we often
cannot catch up with them,'' he said.
   ``We cannot leave things as they are, especially since
fundamental economic and social processes are unfolding and an
ideological and political struggle is under way over key problems of
social development,'' Gorbachev said.
   Some party stalwarts have said they fear the Communist Party,
enshrined by the constitution as the country's ``leading force,'' is
losing its grip on political power as the legislature grows stronger
and frustrated citizens sometimes take matters into their own hands.
   Gorbachev also said the party must adopt a new program and rules.
A new program was adopted at the last Congress, replacing a
Khrushchev-era document that had served for more than 20 years.
   Ethnic disputes in many Soviet republics have disrupted
Gorbachev's drive to reform society. On the eve of the Central
Committee meeting, Armenian activists appealed to Moscow to order an
end to what they call an economic blockade imposed on their Caucasus
Mountain republic by neighboring Azerbaijan.
   The official Tass news agency reported Tuesday that two policeman
were killed by a mob a day earlier in an Azerbaijani village on a
blocked road to Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian enclave of the
republic. Armenia has claimed the region.
   In Tashkent, Uzbekistan, a weekend ``Friendship Carnival''
degenerated into mob violence that included a sexual assault on a
girl in the subway and the siege of an Interior Ministry building,
Tass said.
   In the Baltic republics of Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia,
Communist officials have joined in varying degrees with informal
political movements that demand sovereignty from Moscow.

<HEAD>Democrats Propose $1.8 Billion Aid Package for Poland, Hungary</HEAD>

   Senate Democrats, contending the Bush
administration is ``missing the boat'' on the surging reform
movements in Poland and Hungary, on Tuesday proposed a $1.8 billion
aid package that would dwarf the assistance offered by the White
House.
   Accusing President Bush of timidity and a ``failure of
leadership,'' Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said the Democrats'
three-year proposal would be addressed by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Wednesday with the aim of getting it before
the Senate quickly.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., called the proposal ``a gamble for
freedom'' and said it would help Poland's new non-communist
government build a free economic market and democratic institutions.
   The aid package would authorize $423 million in the 1990 fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1 and $381 million in each of the next two years.
   President Bush initially proposed a one-time $100 million aid
package for Poland, and last week proposed an additional $50 million
in food assistance.
   The centerpiece of the Democratic proposal is the establishment
of a $300 million-a-year ``enterprise fund'' over the next three
years to support free enterprise economic development in Poland.
   The plan also would authorize spending $75 million in each of the
next three years to establish a similar fund for Hungary.
   Cranston said the proposal calls for skimming the money from the
$40 billion spent by the Pentagon each year for research and
development.
   The bill, which combines elements of the administration's aid
proposals with proposals by congressional Democrats, has these other
major elements:
   _Authorizes the extension of Overseas Private Investment Corp.
guarantees to U.S. businesses investing in Poland and Hungary.
   _Authorizes the extension of trade preference benefits to Poland.
   _Authorizes $11 million in scientific and education exchanges
along with medical assistance and help in building democratic
institutions for Poland and Hungary.
   _Authorizes $25 million to help modernize Poland's
telecommunications system.
   _Authorizes $3 million for Peace Corps activities in Poland and
Hungary.
   _Directs the president to encourage debt for equity swaps and
debt rescheduling negotiations to help Poland deal with its massive
foreign debt.
   _Authorizes the president to pursue other initiatives, including
a possible airlift of food to Poland.
   ``We need a substantive economic commitment of enduring support
for free market mechanisms and democratic institutions in Poland and
Hungary, a commitment on the scope and duration of the Marshall
Plan'' which helped Western Europe rebuild after World War II,
Cranston said.
   ``I am convinced it is in America's interest to help these
struggling nations move away from the failed policies of the past,
and to move to a brighter future under pluralism, democracy and free
markets,'' he said.
   Cranston said it would be ``tragic for the United States to be
excessively cautious, for the White House to mistake the status quo
for stability.''
   The Democratic proposal came one day after Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the Bush administration's aid
package for Poland and Hungary niggardly and urged the president to
quickly ``go beyond symbolic nods and meager gestures.''

   The American Red Cross organized its biggest
domestic relief effort in four years and the Coast Guard dispatched
ships and planes Tuesday to bring emergency assistance to Puerto
Rican victims of Hurricane Hugo.
   Relief workers gathered blankets, cots, food, medicine and other
supplies for shipment to Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth where
about 27,000 people were reported homeless in the wake of the storm.
   ``We're working with the Air Force, trying to get our supplies on
their planes,'' said Brian Ruberry, a Red Cross spokesman in
Washington. ``The problem right now, of course, is that the airports
are closed, and even when they reopen we don't know what size planes
they'll be able to accommodate.''
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency, the nation's lead agency
for disaster relief, launched a C-141 cargo plane loaded with
government relief workers and communications gear from Martinsburg,
W.Va., bound for St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the
National Guard reported damage to 90 percent of the buildings.
   Coast Guard C-130s from Florida, South Carolina and Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, headed to San Juan, Puerto Rico, with emergency supplies,
while two Coast Guard cutters assisted with communications and
relief efforts.
   ``We don't know the extent of the mobilization that's going to be
required,'' said FEMA spokesman Bill McAda in Washington. ``That's
essentially what we know at this point. Our radio communications
have been virtually nonexistent across the island since the storm
went across.''
   Five Red Cross supply centers across the nation organized relief
shipments in hopes that Air Force flights would be able to launch
soon from bases in Ohio, New Jersey and South Carolina.
   ``We are sending cots, blankets and comfort kits _ those contain
soap, toothbrushes, shampoo and other toiletries _ to a staging area
in Dayton, Ohio,'' Ruberry said. ``We're sending in all 15,000 of
each of these items.''
   About 400 Red Cross workers in Puerto Rico took care of about
25,000 people Monday night _ offering food, shelter and medical
attention, he said.
   The ferocious storm produced a groundswell of public support,
especially in New York's Puerto Rican community, the largest on the
mainland with an estimated 1.5 million people.
   New York's Christian Community Benevolent Association and Banco
Popular de Puerto Rico scheduled a weekend benefit concert featuring
pop star Lisa Lisa, and television and radio stations planned
marathon fund-raisers.
   Collections of clothing, food and donations are planned Saturday
at two major intersections in New York City, said the Rev. Ruben
Diaz, a native of Puerto Rico and executive director of the
association.
   Community support was ``heavy, heavy, heavy,'' he said.
   ``I just got a call from the Boy Scouts. They're offering 25 kids
to help on Saturday. We will have vehicles from our organization to
go pick up everything,'' Diaz said.
   He said he was in touch through newly restored telephone service
with mayors in several Puerto Rican cities to relay messages from
nervous relatives.
   In Miami, the government tourist office for Puerto Rico was
flooded with calls from people who couldn't reach relatives at home,
but regional manager Teresa Morales said she hasn't been able to
reach anyone either.
   ``We're in the same boat,'' she said. ``I do have all of my
relatives down there, and I haven't been able to get through.''
   A two-member disaster response team from Miami's Metro-Dade fire
department, a specialized unit that routinely travels to some of the
world's worst disasters, had traveled to Barbados on Saturday in
preparation for the storm.
   The pair set up a communications center in Antigua on Tuesday,
paying particular attention to the island of Montserrat.
   ``An airplane that flew over showed that just about everything
was down. There were no standing structures. They feel they've lost
everything,'' said Mel Montes, deputy director of the Metro-Dade
department.

<HEAD>Special Prosecutor Wants Attorney General's Appeal Powers Limited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney general should not be empowered to
appeal a judge's secrecy order in trials being conducted by
independent counsels, Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh told
Congress on Tuesday.
   Walsh, appointed an independent counsel in 1986 to investigate
the Iran-Contra affair, urged the House Intelligence legislative
affairs subcommittee against adopting legislation to specifically
give the attorney general such power under the Classified
Information Procedures Act.
   The independent counsel, speaking to reporters after the closed
hearing, noted that the attorney general already has the power to
file a court affidavit blocking a trial if he feels disclosure of
certain secrets in open court would endanger national security.
   But Walsh, who was forced to jettison three major conspiracy
charges against former White House aide Oliver L. North because of
the government's refusal to release certain classified information,
said the attorney general should not be allowed to appeal
trial-court rulings on secrecy in cases conducted by special
prosecutors.
   To do so would undermine the independence of special prosecutors,
said Walsh.
   ``If the attorney general feels that a case should be interrupted
to protect classified information, that should be a clean-cut act
which the public can understand and for which he takes political
responsiblity,'' Walsh said in an allusion to the Justice
Department's response to secrecy problems arising from his
prosecution of a former CIA agent.
   ``He's not in there to tinker with it. And he should not come in
unless he wants to kill the case,'' Walsh said.
   In a report to the committee released after the hearing, Walsh
pointedly noted that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh threatened to
file an affidavit preventing disclosure of secrets in the trial of
former CIA station chief Joseph Fernandez.
   As jury selection was set to begin on July 24, Thornburgh instead
sought a stay of the trial while he appealed the judge's ruling that
the details of three CIA programs in Costa Rica and the locations of
CIA stations in Latin America could be disclosed in court.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond is now
considering whether the attorney general has right to appeal such a
ruling. The appellate court has stayed the trial of Fernandez,
accused of lying about his role in setting up a clandestine arms
resupply network for the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Walsh also urged the panel to adopt legislation requiring the
attorney general to notify the intelligence committees of Congress
so those panels ``would be able to look at the so-called secret
information to see whether it's a true secret.''
   ``The basic controversy is as to matters which are classified but
which are publicly known,'' Walsh said.
   ``There are some matters, which even though the public knows it,
the intelligence agencies wish to keep classified, and not release
even for use at trial, even though it may mean that the trial has to
be dropped,'' Walsh said.
   Before the trial of North, who was convicted of three Iran-Contra
coverup charges, intelligence agencies objected to the
identification of countries that helped arm the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Similar secrecy problems have arisen in the Fernandez case, even
though some of the same secrets were disclosed in North's trial.
   Walsh said that the intelligence agencies are apparently
concerned that ``in the framework of the Fernandez case, it might
get into much more nitty-gritty detail.''
   ``While I recognize these problems, but to defeat a case ... to
protect that rather abstract concern, seems to me going too far,''
Walsh said.
   Rep. Matthew F. McHugh, D-N.Y., the subcommittee chairman, said
the panel may draft some legislation but first wants to hear
testimony from Thornburgh, whom he said has refused so far to
discuss the issue.

   Angola's Marxist government, which is trying to
end a rebellion backed by the United States, became the 152nd member
of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday and
said it wants American investment.
   ``Angola is defending the West and we will give protection and a
guarantee of security to American investors in our country,''
Finance Minister Augusto Teixeira de Matos told a news conference.
   Despite U.S. support of the rebel Unita army headed by Jonas
Savimbi, the Angolan government says it has protected U.S. oil
installations with the help of Cuban troops.
   The United States voted against Angolan membership but did not
pressure other Western nations to join. It has the biggest voting
power in both: 19.14 percent in the fund and 16.33 percent in the
bank.
   Both the bank and the fund have some members with Communist
governments, including China, Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Vietnam
and Laos, but the Soviet Union is not among them and their total
voting strength is small.
   De Matos said investment in Angolan oil is expanding and
predicted that American investment in it will increase. Investment
in other kinds of business _ fisheries, farming, transport and
services would also be welcome, he added.

   Cigarette production is declining this year and
so is the average smoking rate among Americans _ for the 16th
consecutive year, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Total output is expected to drop from last year's 695 billion
cigarettes because of higher prices, health concerns and smoking
restrictions, the department's Economic Research Service said in its
report.
   Cigarette use may drop about 3.5 percent from last year's average
of 3,096 cigarettes, or fewer than 155 packs of 20 each, the report
said.
   The average is for all Americans 18 years and older, smokers and
non-smokers alike. It is a statistical comparison only and does not
indicate the actual smoking habits of the population.
   Cigarette smoking peaked in 1963 at an average of 4,345 _ more
than 217 packs _ before beginning its longtime downward trend.
   Total U.S. tobacco production this year is up about 9 percent
from 1988, mostly because of an increased acreage, the report said.
   ``Even with the larger crop and the continuing decline in U.S.
cigarette consumption, flue-cured (the most abundant type of U.S.
tobacco) auction prices are higher than a year ago,'' the report
said. ``The higher prices result from tightening supplies because of
reduced carry-in (old inventories), a relatively good quality crop,
and higher price supports.''
   Analysts said that prospects for world tobacco use next season
indicated ``a small increase in sales and use of cigarettes and
unmanufactured tobacco.'' U.S. exports of unmanufactured tobacco
leaf ``may rise a little'' from last season.

   Iran-Contra prosecutors made ``an irreparable
mistake'' by failing to get Justice Department permission before
launching a perjury probe of Richard Secord's testimony to Congress,
his lawyer said Tuesday.
   U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson said Secord was raising
a significant legal issue, but rejected as too time-consuming an
attempt to delay the trial so that an appeals court panel could
issue an advisory opinion.
   ``We're looking at about a year'' if such a course were pursued,
said the judge.
   At a hearing Tuesday, Secord's attorney, Thomas Green, said all
nine criminal counts pertaining to Secord's congressional tstimony
should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Robinson said near the
end of the court hearing that, ``this case is going to go to trial,
I think.''
   Secord, the retired Air Force major general enlisted by Oliver
North to run arms to the Contras and assist in the Reagan
administration's secret Iran initiative, is accused of obstructing
Congress, perjury and making false statements. His trial is
scheduled to begin Nov. 13.
   The government says Secord lied when he denied taking money out
of the companies he and Iranian-born businessman Albert Hakim used
in the Iran-Contra initiative. Prosecutors allege Secord took over a
million dollars in profits.
   Green argued that independent counsel Lawrence Walsh was required
under the Ethics in Government Act to get an expanded mandate from
the attorney general before launching the probe of Secord's 1987
testimony to the Iran-Contra committees of Congress.
   Walsh was appointed in December 1986 and ``I think the
independent counsel made an irreparable mistake in not going back to
the attorney general'' seeking to expand the investigative mandate
before delving into Secord's congressional testimony, Green said.
   Associate independent counsel Reid Weingarten said the intent of
the appeals court panel appointing the Iran-Contra prosecutor was to
allow wide latitude in the investigation.
   ``It's hard to imagine a broader grant of jurisdiction,''
Weingarten said of the appeals court panel's mandate.
   The court on Dec. 19, 1986, appointed Walsh to look into alleged
crimes in the Iran-Contra affair committed ``in or about 1984 down
to the present.'' It also authorized the independent counsel to
prosecute any other alleged crime committed by North or others when
the allegations are ``connected with or arising out of'' Walsh's
investigation.
   Secord also is accused of three counts of conspiring, offering
and paying illegal gratuities to North.
   In a recent interview on the Fox Television program ``The
Reporters,'' Secord said he has suffered financially due to the
Iran-Contra scandal.
   ``We're about as close to being broke as you can come,'' Secord
of his family. He said he had to pull two of his children out of
college because ``we just couldn't continue to support that.''
   Asked in the TV interview about his allegedly having pulled in
more than a million dollars in profits from the Iran-Contra scandal,
Secord responded:
   ``If I had done that I wouldn't be in the financial bind now ...
It's just pure myth.''
   On Monday, Secord was convicted of driving while intoxicated in
suburban Virginia, his second drunken driving conviction since May.
He is appealing both convictions.

   Fighting back tears, a South Carolina woman
whose jaw was destroyed by a drug user's shotgun a decade ago told
senators Tuesday the nation needs strong death penalty laws.
   ``The problem I see with the death penalty is the lengthy appeals
process,'' Wanda Summers of Pawley's Island, S.C., told the Senate
Judiciary Committee, which is considering measures to increase the
number of crimes that could result in death sentences under federal
law.
   Senators commended Mrs. Summers for bravery in telling the story
of the Feb. 22, 1979, murder spree by two men that left four dead.
She and a fellow worker at a convenience store were taken to a
deserted road, raped and shotgunned, she testified.
   Her assailant, Ronald Woomer, left her for dead, Mrs. Summers
said. Actually, she turned her head at the moment of the shotgun
blast, which blew away part of her mouth and her jaw. Despite her
wound, she was able find help, but her co-worker died in the
incident.
   The two assailants were found the same night in a Myrtle Beach
motel. One of them, Eugene Skaar, committed suicide. Woomer was
captured, convicted of murder and sentenced to death. He has been on
death row ever since as the appeals process has continued.
   Mrs. Summers said she has been helped by reconstructive surgery
and psychiatric care, but added that it ``is hard to get up in the
morning and look in the mirror.''
   ``It's hard when little kids stare at you and adults try not to.
Its hard to smile when you know how you look when you do.''
   She was asked by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., a sponsor of the
death penalty legislation, if she considered life in prison
sufficient punishment even for those who commit heinous crimes.
   ``I believe the terrible crimes he committed do warrant the death
sentence,'' she said. ``He did not give the four other people the
option of life or death.''
   South Carolina state Solicitor James C. Anders testified that the
two killers were ``drugged up'' on PCP and alcohol.
   Congress as part of last year's anti-drug legislation approved
capital punishment for drug kingpins whose racketeering activities
result in death.
   A 1972 Supreme Court decision, however, blocked use of a number
of death penalty provisions on the books at that time, calling
unconstitutional the discretion the law allowed juries and judges on
whether to impose death or not.
   At the hearing, Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis
told senators that under current law a jury can impose the death
penalty for the murder of a Drug Enforcement agent investigating a
case but not for the murder of an FBI agent responding to a bank
robbery.
   Legislation before the committee would restore the death penalty
for murdering a member of Congress, the Cabinet or the Supreme Court
to espionage. It would extend capital punishment provisions to
murdering foreign officials and official guests, kidnapping
resulting in death, attempted presidential assassination, murder for
hire and murder in aid of a racketeering enterprise.

the progress of Hurricane Hugo on Tuesday, hoping it would spin
harmlessly out to sea but fearing the worst.
   ``We've just been inundated with calls about preparedness,'' said
Dan Summers, who coordinates emergency operations in New Hanover
County, N.C., one of the places considered most vulnerable to the
storm.
   Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Florida said it
was too early to tell whether Hugo might turn toward the northwest
and take aim at the U.S. mainland or veer eastward and churn out
into the Atlantic.
   ``It is definitely a potential threat. People in the United
States should be monitoring this storm,'' said meteorologist Jesse
Moore at the Hurricane Center. ``Any time you have a hurricane with
winds of 105 mph or more possibly coming ashore in the beachfront
areas, you have the potential for a great deal of damage.''
   If it does assault the Eastern Seaboard, possibly as early as
Friday, Hugo could land anywhere from Florida to Massachusetts,
forecasters said, with North Carolina getting votes as the most
likely target.
   Hurricane Center director Bob Sheets said he expects to issue a
hurricane watch Wednesday from South Florida to Cape Hatteras, N.C.,
with the East Coast likely to feel the hurricane's effects in two to
three days.
   ``Hopefully, we'll be able to narrow that somewhat tomorrow,''
Sheets said.
   Emergency officials up and down the coast began making plans for
the hurricane, although most said it was too early to take any
defensive action.
   ``Right now, we're just watching the storm,'' said Robert Smith
of the Norfolk, Va., Office of Emergency Services. ``Tomorrow, we'll
be having a meeting with the shelter managers, school
superintendants and others to review the procedures.''
   In Georgia, Atlanta Red Cross spokeswoman Ann Willcox said all
emergency workers had been placed on standby alert and officials
were contacting volunteers to make sure they are prepared to help
out in a disaster.
   And in Florida, NASA officials fretted about the space shuttle
Atlantis, sitting on its pad at Cape Canaveral in preparation for an
October launch. Space agency officials decided to wait until
Wednesday before deciding whether to pull the spacecraft back into
the safety of its hangar _ a tedious procedure that could delay its
flight.
   The American Red Cross ordered food and made last-minute
preparations to open 58 shelters in Miami and 23 in Fort Lauderdale,
and several radio stations in central Florida planned to activate
storm tracking hotlines to keep residents up to date.
   Florida disaster worker Lee Barnett said he was ``assuming the
worst and hoping for the best.''
   Farther north, officials in New York and Massachusetts said they
were just keeping track of the storm and hoping their states weren't
on its itinerary.
   For those in charge of emergency agencies, preparations for a
hurricane can include stocking schools and evacuation centers with
food, notifying residents of evacuation plans and shoring up
vulnerable structures.
   Preprations for individual coastal residents are much the same.
   Martin Nelson, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center,
said anyone in Hugo's path should stock up on non-perishable food,
flashlight batteries and drinking water, and should make sure their
car has plenty of gas.
   Boat-owners should bring their vessels ashore if possible, and
residents closest to the water _ especially those in mobile homes _
should be ready to evacuate. Pet owners need to find places for
their animals, which usually aren't allowed at evacuation shelters.
   Nelson had warnings for the socially minded and the adventurous.
He said those in the hurricane's path shouldn't plan hurricane
parties, and no one should venture outside if they are in the eye of
a hurricane.

   The House Republican leader said Tuesday that
the Barney Frank case was becoming ``a stain upon the House of
Representatives,'' as allies of the embattled Democrat tried to
quell suggestions he was near resignation.
   Frank, a liberal who disclosed his homosexuality in 1987, has
come under scrutiny since acknowledging a two-year relationship with
a male prostitute, whom he paid for sex and then hired as a personal
assistant.
   Rep. Robert Michel, R-Ill., asserted that the Massachusetts
Democrat was benefiting from a double standard that would have dealt
more harshly with other members of Congress in similar circumstances.
   ``If it were anyone other than Barney Frank ... If I were to have
a woman prostitute in my employ for my own self gratification, I'd
be run out of town,'' Michel said.
   At Frank's own request, the House ethics committee is
investigating his involvement with Stephen L. Gobie and Gobie's
disputed claim that the congressman was aware he was operating a
prostitution service out of Frank's Capitol Hill apartment. Frank
has said he would await the ethics committee's inquiry.
   Michel, answering questions at a news conference, said he was
``distressed to have anything of that nature become a stain up on
the House of Representatives.''
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, in a breakfast meeting
with reporters, acknowledged Frank was under pressure to resign but
said the congressman was right to await the ethics committee inquiry.
   ``He's done what he should have done,'' Brown said. ``The ethics
committee ought to go forward. Pressure is building to resign. But
we ought to let the quasi-judicial process go forward.''
   Asked if Frank had become an embarrassment to the Democratic
Party, Brown said: ``No, don't think so. There have been issues like
this for years in poitics. But I think we should let the
quasi-judicial process take over, and then we can make some
recommendations.''
   Frank, meanwhile, sought to carry out normal congressional duties
while declining to discuss his case with reporters.
   Frank attended a morning subcommittee meeting without speaking
publicly. He had normal office appointments in the afternoon, said
his administrative assistant, Doug Cahn.
   Gobie, Frank's accuser, breathed fresh life into the story by
recounting his version of their relationship in the airing Tuesday
of a videotaped appearance on the television program, ``Geraldo.''
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt also cited the ethics
comittee when asked about Frank.
   ``I don't think we should try people outside of that process,''
Gephardt, D-Mo., said.
   Close political allies of Frank contended he is not weighing an
immediate resignation, despite the Boston Globe's editorial call for
his resignation and private suggestions from political sources that
he was considering such a move.
   Frank said over the weekend he would step aside if he decided his
case was hurting the liberal causes he has worked for.
   Ann Lewis, Frank's sister and a Washington political consultant,
said Frank was wrestling with the question of whether he might not
seek re-election because of diminished effectiveness, but would not
resign before the ethics committee probe was carried out.
   A Massachusetts ally of Frank, Democratic Rep. Joe Moakley,
described the continuing disclosures about Frank as ``like Chinese
(water) torture,'' but defended Frank's decision to await the ethics
committee review.
   ``Some people may resign and cut their losses, but I think it's
up to the individual member who's being charged,'' Moakley said.
``This may very well be the thing Barney Frank is remembered for in
Congress. It's like when (former Ways and Means Committee Chairman)
Wilbur Mills had his tryst with the dancer and ended up in the tidal
basin.''
   Dan Payne, Frank's long-time media consultant in Boston, said
Frank did not intend to resign before the ethics committee acts and
reacted angrily to growing speculation in Washington political
circles about Frank's fate.
   ``There's no way Barney's going to let this end without getting
his day in the ethics committee,'' Payne said.
   ``I think it would be a mistake to resign because the political
kibitzing industry says he should,'' Payne said. ``It's really sick,
almost, that people are now engaged in trying to provide the
definitive wisecrack about Barney.''
   Payne said Frank's support within his district remains strong.
   Frank has become the focus of intense media coverage of his
personal life, including his current long-term relationship with a
male friend. In a reaction to the intensity of coverage, Frank has
declined press interviews about his case this week _ although he
conducted several last week.
   Reaction to Frank's case has been divided within Washington's
homosexual community, although Frank's decision to reveal his sexual
preference two years ago made him a visible symbol of a politically
successful gay person who has acknowledged his homosexuality.
   The Washington Blade, a gay newspaper in Washington, last week
published two letters from writers who said Frank should resign,
including one writer who said ``he owes all gays an apology for his
stupidity.''

<HEAD>Police Say Detained Man is Not Colombian Drug Baron</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Colombia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Tuesday that a man arrested
near the Colombian border is not Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a
Colombian drug baron sought worldwide.
   Police earlier said the detained man had a ``strong resemblance''
to Gacha, a kingpin of Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Humberto Giffuni, deputy director of the Judicial Technical
Police, said the man, who he did not identify, would be released
along with three other people arrested with him Monday.
   ``After completing the established identification procedure we
have come to the conclusion that he is not the person wanted in
Colombia,'' Giffuni told reporters.
   Local news reports, which police would not confirm, identified
the man as Alirio Quintero Alvarez, 47, and said the people arrested
with him were Zulima Pena, Flor Maria Saavedra and Carmen Paez.
   All four were seized by police at a ranch in Tachira state, near
the Colombian border, and brought to Caracas where they were held
for 24 hours while authorities questioned them and checked their
identifications.
   The leaders of Colombia's cocaine cartels have been in hiding
since the Colombian government declared war against drug traffickers
after their hired gunmen assassinated Sen. Luis Carlos Galan during
a campaign rally Aug. 18.
   Colombian soldiers raided Rodriguez Gacha's ranch on the
outskirts of Pacho, Colombia, last month and after an exchange of
gunfire arrested 13 people, including Gacha's son, Freddy Rodriguez,
but his father escaped.

   The Library of Congress announced Tuesday the
first 25 American movie classics to be placed on the new National
Film Registry as ``culturally, historically or esthetically
significant'' treasures in the art form of filmmaking.
   The list was heavy with popular, Academy Award-winning titles,
from ``The Best Years of Our Lives'' to ``The Wizard of Oz.'' It
included one documentary, ``Nanook of the North'' and one
contemporary hit, 1977's ``Star Wars.''
   Librarian of Congress James H. Billington said the selections
don't constitute a list of the best American movies, but most are
easily recognizable among moviegoers' all-time favorites.
   The 25, listed alphabetically:
   ``The Best Years of Our Lives,'' 1946; ``Casablanca,'' 1942;
``Citizen Kane,'' 1941; ``The Crowd,'' 1928; ``Dr. Strangelove; or,
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,'' 1964; ``The
General,'' 1927; ``Gone With the Wind,'' 1939; ``The Grapes of
Wrath,'' 1940; ``High Noon,'' 1952; ``Intolerance,'' 1916; ``The
Learning Tree,'' 1969, and ``The Maltese Falcon,'' 1941.
   Also, ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' 1939; ``Modern Times,''
1936; ``Nanook of the North,'' 1922; ``On the Waterfront,'' 1954;
``The Searchers,'' 1956; ``Singin' in the Rain,'' 1952; ``Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs,'' 1937; ``Some Like it Hot,'' 1959; ``Star
Wars,'' 1977; ``Sunrise,'' 1927; ``Sunset Boulevard,'' 1950;
``Vertigo,'' 1958, and ``The Wizard of Oz,'' 1939.
   Billington sought to defuse an almost certain controversy among
film critics and scholars over the selections.
   ``Make no mistake, this list of 25 films is not a list of the
best 25 American films,'' he said. ``Film critics and scholars could
not agree on such a list, and the Library of Congress would not
embark on any such futile exercise. This is not Academy Awards
night.''
   Rather, he said, the list ``should suggest to the American public
the breadth of great American filmmaking'' under guidelines set by
Congress.
   No films less than 10 years old were eligible, and there was only
one issued in the past 20.
   The registry was created by Congress last year as part of the
National Film Preservation Act, which called for naming 25
outstanding movies to the registry at the Library of Congress
annually for three years.
   The legislation was prompted partly by the recent boom in
coloring of black and white films, a practice loudly protested by
moviemakers.
   The law does not prevent coloring, but any film listed in the
National Film Registry must carry a warning label if it has been
colorized or ``materially altered'' in versions produced for video
cassettes, television broadcast or other showings.
   Three directors whose films were chosen, Elia Kazan, Billy Wilder
and Stanley Donen, said Congress should halt colorization.
   ``They should take the next step, to protect those films from all
kinds of distortion _ speeding up, colorization and all the other
things that have been done to them _ and leave them the way we made
them,'' Kazan said. ``That is what they can do to really show how
they honor our films.''
   Seven of the winning films are owned by broadcasting magnate Ted
Turner, who is a champion of film colorization.
   Dave Kehr, chairman of the National Society of Film Critics and a
member of the National Film Preservation Board, said that the movies
chosen made up ``a very safe, conservative list'' but that he wished
they ``had been a little more reflective of bread-and-butter
Hollywood.''
   Each film added to the government's version of a movie hall of
fame will bear a seal designating it ``as an enduring part of our
national cultural heritage.''
   The Library of Congress will obtain a high-quality print of the
original version of the movie for its collection of more than 75,000
film and television titles dating to the 19th century.
   Billington said half of all movies made before 1950 and 80
percent of those made before 1930 have been lost forever, because of
the deterioration of early nitrate film into powder and because of
sloppy cuts and editing of films for videotapes and TV broadcasts.
   ``The cold, hard fact is that for all their popularity in America
today, films are an endangered species for the America of
tomorrow,'' Billington said.
   The list is the result of a lengthy process involving nominations
of nearly 1,000 movie titles by mail from the general public. The
list was narrowed substantially by the 13 members of the new
National Film Preservation Board which met in Los Angeles in July.
   Billington made the final selection of the 25 top films and
indicated Tuesday that he personally made at least one addition to
the list, which he refused to identify. He said there was no
overwhelming, all-time favorite nominated by the public or chosen by
the panel of experts.
   The board included representatives of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, the American Film Institute, the
Directors Guild of America, the Motion Picture Association of
America, the National Association of Broadcasters, the National
Society of Film Critics, the Screen Actors Guild of America, the
Writers Guild of America, movie and TV producers and film scholars.
   Billington said his goals in selecting the outstanding films were
to help promote movies as an indigenous American art form and
generate public interest in preserving films.

   A housing organization on Tuesday said the
problems plaguing the Department of Housing and Urban Development
should not be used as an excuse to dismantle federal programs
necessary to meet the nation's housing needs.
   The investigation of mismanagement and abuse at HUD is no reason
to delay maintainance and development of much-needed housing, said
John Simon, president of the National Housing Conference.
   ``The highest priority of the HUD Secretary and the Congress
should be immediate action to address the critical need for
additional low- and moderate-income housing,'' Simon said at a news
conference. ``The need to investigate should not be an excuse for
inaction in meeting the nation's housing needs.''
   Simon said that with nine months past since the start of the
current congressional session and the Bush administration, ``it's
time to move on ... the housing crisis is getting much worse.''
   More than 500,000 federally subsidized rental housing units could
be lost in the next 15 years due to federal inaction or weakened
national financial conditions, he said.
   The National Housing Conference represents more than 1,000 public
and private builders, developers, planners, architects, housing
financiers and tenant groups.
   Simon said current estimates of the homeless population range
from 700,000 to 4 million, but an additional 4 million to 14 million
American families are ``doubled up and tripled up in apartments of
friends and family.''
   ``Even a mild recession could double homelessness in America
virtually overnight,'' he said.
   Simon said current budget requests for housing are inadequate,
with an additional $13 billion to $18 billion needed for federally
assisted housing programs and $21.5 billion required to repair
dilapidated public housing stock. Another $10 billion should be
included for new housing construction, he said.
   Simon said he believed Housing Secretary Jack Kemp ``has not
gotten the support of the administration'' for funding existing
housing programs.
   Instead of using $50 million from the operating subsidies of
public housing administrations to fight drugs in public housing,
Kemp should have been given a separate allocation, Simon said.
   Meanwhile, one private mortgage insurer announced it would help
low- and moderate-income families purchase almost 10,000 homes in
the next year by insuring $500 million in loans through the a new
program.
   Under the Community Home Buyer's Program, prospective homebuyers
would be allowed to purchase a home with lower down payment and less
savings on hand and using a higher portion of their income for
housing expenses than traditional loans require.
   The cornerstone of the program, developed by GE Capital Mortgage
Insurance Cos., is a home-buying and mortgage credit course
including pre- and post-loan-closing sessions for borrowers.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Stop NFL Steroid Testing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday refused to stop the
National Football League from testing for steroids and declined to
reinstate 13 players suspended under the program.
   U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson said ``the clear
congressional policy against judicial interference in labor
disputes'' poses a ``formidable obstacle'' to the players
association's request to block the program with a preliminary
injunction.
   The players' labor union, which says steroid testing is
unreliable, asked the court to suspend the league's program while it
is pending before an arbitrator.
   Robinson said the record in the case ``simply does not present
the kind of irreparable harm'' to the players that would be required
to issue an injunction.
   The NFL suspended 13 players for 30 days after another federal
judge on Aug. 28 refused to issue a temporary restraining order
against the league.
   The players association asked Robinson to restore the suspended
players to active status and to order the league to refrain from any
further suspensions on the basis of steroid testing until the
arbitrator rules. The labor union also sought to enjoin the league
from further testing for steroids.

   Heavy rain fell along the central Atlantic Coast on Tuesday, with
more than 2 inches in some areas, and Hurricane Hugo roared through
the Bahamas.
   Hugo moved toward the northwest at 12 mph, with a maximum
sustained wind speed of 105 mph. It seemed to be threatening the
coast somewhere from Florida to North Carolina, but meteorologists
could not predict its wobbly path. It lurched to the north and west
because other weather systems seemed to be blocking it from heading
into the open Atlantic.
   Behind Hugo, Tropical Storm Iris approached hurricane strength
with maximum sustained wind speed near 70 mph. It was located
northeast of the northern Leeward Islands.
   A low pressure area off northeastern North Carolina moved
northeastward, spreading moisture from the Atlantic across the mid
Atlantic Coast region.
   A small stream and urban flood watch was issued for the New
Jersey sections of the metropolitan Delaware Valley, where 1.5 to 3
inches of rain was reported and where an additional 2 inches was
possible during the night.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
2.40 inches at Salisbury, Md.; 2.15 at Dover, Del.; 1.93 at Atlantic
City, N.J.; 1.63 at Millville, N.J.; 1.34 at Wilmington, Del.; and
1.31 at Philadelphia.
   Elsewhere, showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered along a
cold front from Minnesota into South Dakota, and across
north-central New Mexico, where up to an inch of rain was reported
around Albuquerque.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees at Thompson Falls, Mont., and Sandberg, Calif., to 93 at
Harlingen, Texas, and in Arizona at Phoenix and Tucson. Tuesday's
low in the Lower 48 states was 24 at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Wednesday, widespread rain was forecast over the northern and
central Rockies. Showers and scattered thunderstorms were forecast
from the middle Atlantic Coast into Florida.
   Highs in the 60s were predicted from the northern Rockies into
northern North Dakota; in the 90s across southern Texas and the
southern half of the Florida Peninsula; and in the 70s or 80s across
much of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the Roman Catholic
primate of Poland, said Tuesday the Carmelite convent near Auschwitz
may be moved, but he complained that Jewish protests had ``touched
the dignity'' of the nuns.
   Glemp said he had not seen a Vatican announcement Tuesday saying
the convent should be moved away from the former Nazi death camp and
that the Vatican would help pay to build a new prayer center outside
Auschwitz in Poland.
   But when reporters described the announcement, he said it sounded
like a ``forceful resolution of the problem, and I don't think that
would be a very positive way.'' He said that by ``forceful'' he
meant ``an administrative enforcement of the transfer of the
sisters, not their own expressed wish.''
   Glemp, who was on a 24-hour visit to consecrate a Polish church
in this southwestern city, said that building a prayer center away
from the Nazi death camp would be a ``great step, we hope, in order
to solve this problem.''
   ``I do think there is a possibility that the nuns could be moved
elsewhere,'' added Glemp. ``But if they were to be moved this should
be done with charity because ... that would be also crossing out
their rights.''
   Glemp's remarks were in line with recent hints he has softened
his position on the convent, which many Jews regard as an offensive
intrusion.
   At least 2.5 million Jews were among the 4 million people
murdered by the Nazis at the World War II death camp.
   The nuns were supposed to move to a prayer center away from the
camp by Feb. 22 under a 1987 agreement between four European
cardinals and an international Jewish delegation.
   But the Catholic Church in Poland balked at honoring the accord
and the deadline passed with no sign of a center or any move to
relocate the nuns.
   The cardinal, at the center of the dispute which has split the
Catholic Church and revived charges of deep-rooted anti-Semitism in
Poland, spent most of a 40-minute news conference defending his
position.
   Glemp had canceled plans to travel from Britain to the United
States because of threats of Jewish protests.
   ``The great Jewish protests which developed around the problem of
the Carmelite nuns in Auschwitz were very sad because they touched
the dignity ... of the women who devote their lives to God,'' said
Glemp. He spoke in Polish, and his remarks were translated into
English by a fellow priest.
   Glemp discussed plans for the prayer center last week with
Zygmunt Nissenbaum, a German-Jewish financier who runs a
philanthropic trust that restores Jewish memorials and who has
offered assistance. Previously, he said, the prayer center was just
``wishful thinking.''
   He did not say when construction might start, nor did he say
explicitly that the nuns would move once the building was complete.
   During the news conference, Glemp called repeatedly for
Catholic-Jewish dialogue over the convent dispute.
   He also acknowledged there was anti-Semitism in Poland, but he
said Poles could not accept that Auschwitz was a purely Jewish
memorial, because many Christians also died there.
   During the summer, Glemp suggested repeatedly he wanted the
convent, established in 1984, to remain and called the accord
offensive.
   Cardinals in the United States, France and Belgium have said the
church should honor the 1987 agreement.
   The controversy grew after seven Jewish protesters, led by a New
York rabbi, tried to climb a fence surrounding the convent and were
forced back by Polish workers in July.
   In remarks that increased Jewish anger, Glemp suggested afterward
that the protesters meant to attack the nuns and said that Jews had
the media ``easily at your disposal in many countries.''

   The number of East Germans seeking
refuge in West Germany's embassies in Prague and Warsaw swelled to
more than 600 on Tuesday, leading Bonn to close its Warsaw embassy
to the public.
   Hungarian news media reported for the first time Tuesday that
Czechoslovak authorities were preventing emigres from reaching
Hungary. A Czechoslovak government official denied the allegation.
   The reports followed refugee complaints recently of East German
and Czechoslovak harassment. The refugees say authorities are trying
to keep them from entering Hungary. From Hungary, they can cross
freely to neutral Austria under special measures adopted by
Hungarian authorities eight days ago.
   Refugees inside the West German Embassy grounds in Prague said
they now numbered 500, with 300 having climbed over the six-foot
fence surrounding the compound the past few days.
   An additional 120 East Germans, also seeking guarantees of safe
passage to the West, are in the embassy in Warsaw.
   The West German Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday it was closing
its Warsaw embassy to the public until further notice, saying the
situation had become untenable.
   Franz Schoeller, Bonn's ambassador to Poland, told the West
German TV network ARD that 104 East Germans were inside the embassy
and 16 more were outside. He did not spell out what he meant by
``outside'' the embassy.
   Bonn officials previously spoke of 110 refugees in the compound.
   Schoeller said ``Poland has promised a pragmatic solution.''
Asked if he meant sending the refugees to West Germany, he replied,
``I don't see it that way yet. We must wait.''
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jurgen Chrobog, said the Polish
citizens seeking visas for West Germany could obtain them at travel
agencies.
   West Germany had already closed to the public its embassies in
Prague and Budapest and the diplomatic mission in East Berlin after
hundreds of East Germans started seeking refuge in the buildings
last month.
   The Budapest embassy reopened to the public after Hungary agreed
to open its borders to the East Germans seeking passage to the West.
   West German border officials reported 700 refugees arrived in
West Germany over the last 24 hours, raising to nearly 17,000 the
number of East Germans who have come to West Germany since Hungary
opened its borders Sept. 11.
   Hungarian radio said the numbers of East Germans seeking refuge
in the Prague embassy probably increased because ``Czechoslovak
authorities are turning East Germans back, that is preventing them
from going to Hungary although they have valid travel documents
authorizing them to travel there.''
   A Prague Foreign Ministry spokesman Tuesday denied that.
``Czechoslovakia honors all international covenants. No problems in
rail or car transportation are made for East Germans traveling to
Hungary with valid documents,'' Ivan Kulhanek said. ``All statements
implying the opposite are untrue.''
   Czechoslovakia, sandwiched between East Germany and Hungary, is
the most direct route for East Germans traveling to Hungary.
   Wolfgang Wagner, an official of a West German charity
organization handling East German refugees in Hungary, said 100 East
Germans who had crossed the border illegally from Czechoslovakia
arrived at his camp Tuesday.
   Before Hungary opened its borders, thousands had crossed
illegally over stretches of the country's Western border that have
been cleared of barbed wire as part of Hungary's more liberal
political and economic policies.
   The state news agency MTI reported Tuesday that criminal
proceedings had been started against nine border guards charged with
smuggling East Germans across the Austrian border.
   It quoted the military prosecutor's office in the west Hungarian
town of Gyoer as saying the guards had, in exchange for
``significant sums,'' helped East Germans clear the border during a
period following Aug. 20, 1989 before Hungary allowed East Germans
to legally cross into Austria.
   Five men have been taken into custody, and the other four have
been taken off border patrol duty, cannot carry out armed service
and are not allowed to leave the military compound until the issue
is clarified, MTI said.
   East Germany's official Communist Party newspaper stepped up its
harsh criticism of West Germany Tuesday, accusing it of ``slave
trade'' in allegedly encouraging the exodus of East Germans to the
West.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department's criminal division is
seeking transcripts of a House subcommittee's hearings on
allegations of influence peddling at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   However, the ranking Republican on the House panel, Rep.
Christopher Shays, said he was unsatisfied with the move, and he
continued to say he may call for a special prosecutor in the case.
   Justice spokesman David Runkel said the criminal division had
asked for the transcripts of hearings being conducted by the House
Government Operations subcommittee.
   Earlier this year, prosecutors in the department's public
integrity section made a preliminary conclusion that the HUD
inspector general's report on influence peddling in the Section 8
moderate rehabilitation program, a main focus of the congressional
investigation, showed no instances of criminal wrongdoing.
   The subcommittee has heard testimony that politically connected
developers received approval from high-level HUD officials in the
award of government housing grants.
   So far, the department has been reviewing newspaper accounts of
the hearings, at which a series of witnesses have described lobbying
of high HUD officials on behalf of development firms, Runkel said.
   The subcommittee has also heard conflicting testimony about the
role of former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. in the awarding of
grants.
   Pierce has been called back for more questioning about whether,
despite his repeated denials, he helped political friends get HUD
grants.
   The subcommittee is expected to vote Wednesday to subpoena
Pierce, who last week abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance. The
former secretary's lawyers said they needed more time to prepare for
the questioning.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., has expressed
the view that other witnesses had ``put the lie'' to Pierce's
denials that he ever helped prominent Republicans get HUD backing
for housing projects.
   Lantos has said he wants to give Pierce an opportunity to clarify
testimony that has been contradicted by other witnesses.
   Earlier Tuesday, Runkel rejected a call by Rep. Bruce Morrison,
D-Conn., for a special prosecutor in the matter.
   ``Investigations are proceeding in U.S. attorneys' offices around
the country and there is no reason to believe these cannot be
handled by the U.S. attorneys,'' Runkel said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh ``has made it clear he wants
these cases given high priority,'' the spokesman added, referring to
investigations of fraud of HUD programs.
   As for Runkel's statement of the request for hearing transcripts,
Shays, R-Conn., said, ``That's not comforting. This should have been
done a long time ago. It just raises questions in my mind about the
veracity of the Justice Department's investigation.''
   He said that because of allegations concerning dealings with HUD
around the country, it is important that any criminal investigation
be centralized in Washington and not be conducted by U.S. attorneys
around the nation.
   He said unless there is a centralized investigation that looks at
the principal former HUD officials involved, including Pierce,
``then I just totally feel we've got to take it away from Justice
and have a special prosecutor. Right now, I just don't know. The
Justice Department hasn't had much communication with committee
members.''
   ``I can assure you that the records of the House subcommittee are
being reviewed closely as a part of the HUD matter,'' Runkel said at
a morning briefing.
   Later in the day, however, Runkel acknowledged that the
department had not yet received any subcommittee records but would
be asking formally for the transcripts of the hearings.
   ``That letter is going up today or tomorrow,'' Runkel said.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ceremony lasted only a few minutes
Tuesday, but for Soviet immigrant Andrei Frolov, the journey to U.S.
citizenship took years.
   Eight years ago, Frolov staged a hunger strike for 26 days in his
homeland to attract the attention of Soviet authorities, who ignored
his plea to join his American wife. In the United States, his wife
did the same.
   After a year of bureaucratic haggling, Frolov's name was added to
the list of Soviet citizens with a spouse in the West who was
allowed to leave in 1982.
   Years later, Frolov, dressed in a three-piece gray suit, stood
outside a San Francisco courtroom ready to fulfill his dream of
citizenship.
   ``It's a great day,'' Frolov said while waiting for the ceremony.
   Frolov has been working as a translator for a Russian-language
newspaper in San Francisco since March, when he left his position at
the Department of Defense Language Institute in Monterey.
   He is also translating his play about life in the Soviet Union,
``Strangers Don't Enter,'' into English, and hopes one day to have
it produced.
   ``I expected life would be hard here because I did not know
English well and I couldn't use my education here. It's getting
better,'' he said.
   A shy, soft-spoken man, Frolov worked as a taxi driver, furniture
mover and bookstore clerk before he began teaching Russian to
soldiers at the institute in Monterey.
   ``Monterey is a pretty small town, and there is a small community
of Russian instructors,'' he said. ``Sometimes it looks like the
Soviet Union. But it is better to be among Americans.''
   Frolov, 58, joined 150 others for the naturalization ceremony
Tuesday. He stood stiffly, with a stern look on his face. Afterward,
he pulled a voter registration form out of his pocket and proudly
proclaimed his intention to register _ probably as a Democrat.
   Asked how he felt, he said simply, ``Great.''
   Frolov's journey began with a fascination with the United States.
A journalist in the Soviet Union, he read American literature and
watched movies in Moscow theaters. Friends teased him, calling him
an ``Americaniste.''
   Then he met Lois Becker, an American student working on a
dissertation at Moscow's Lenin Library.
   Nine months later, they married. When Becker's visa expired, she
was forced to leave the Soviet Union without her husband when she
was unable to find work.
   It was the beginning of the couple's yearlong struggle against
what became a bureaucratic nightmare. Then, for reasons that remain
unknown, Soviet authorities allowed Frolov to leave, and he and
Becker were reunited.
   The transition was not easy; they separated in 1985 and later
divorced.
   Frolov worked at a string of subsistence-level jobs after he
arrived in the United States. He recalls the early days in America,
when a trip to the supermarket could overwhelm him.
   Living alone in a rundown house in Washington D.C., Frolov would
rise early to practice English, watch television to further improve
his conversational skills, and then set off for work in a bookstore.
   He studied at the University of the District of Columbia three
nights a week, and would walk the streets at any hour to satisfy his
wanderlust.
   Although his life in America has been filled with challenges,
Frolov said he has no regrets about leaving the Soviet Union. ``I
still feel some kind of pain. I don't want even to visit Moscow.''

   President Daniel Ortega said Tuesday
that Nicaragua had recently received a shipment of Cuban arms and
defended his nation's right to arm itself.
   The opposition newsaper La Prensa, in its Monday editions, quoted
the Washington Times newspaper as saying U.S. satellites had
observed the arms shipment.
   ``Nicaragua has normal relations with several countries which
have supply us with arms,'' Ortega told The Associated Press when
asked about the matter.
   When reminded that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev promised
the U.S. government to suspend arms sales to Nicaragua, Ortega said,
``Yes, but these are replacements. Arms that have to be replaced. If
a helicopter is damaged, it must be repaired or replaced with
another.''
   He added, ``We maintain the same level of arms to guarantee
defense. We can't risk the defense of our country.''
   Ortega said if there is anything illegal about Nicaragua's
action, the U.S. government could pursue legal channels.
   ``If the United States considers it a crime what we are doing in
Nicaragua, they should take the case to the World Court,'' Ortega
said, referring to the court based in The Hague.
   Ortega made his statements following the opening of a farm silo
Tuesday outside Managua.

<TEXT>
   The national AIDS commission, concerned that
President Bush's anti-drug strategy makes too little mention of
AIDS, on Tuesday agreed to draft a statement calling for treatment
of drug addicts in preventing spread of AIDS.
   The statement will reaffirm the previous AIDS commission's call
for drug treatment on demand as a national goal, said June Osborn,
chairwoman of the new panel.
   Osborn said the statement will be ``carefully worded'' so it does
not appear antagonistic, but she added that the panel ``can be
aggressive ... without being adversarial.''
   ``We want to say something that's a firm reminder in a collegial
sort of way,'' said Osborn, dean of the University of Michigan's
School of Public Health, after she adjourned a two-day meeting of
the panel.
   The previous AIDS commission, formed by President Reagan and
chaired by Admiral James Watkins, now secretary of energy,
highlighted the need for expanded drug treatment capacity to stop
spread of AIDS through sharing of needles by drug users.
   The new AIDS panel, created by Congress last year but not fully
constituted until this summer, will not recommend a specific amount
of funds for drug treatment, but its statement will show that
commissioners ``share the priority judgment of the Watkins
commission,'' Osborn said.
   Commissioner Don Des Jarlais, a New York state coordinator for
AIDS research, estimated that the Bush plan would deliver about a
third of what the Watkins commission said would be needed to treat
all drug addicts.
   The commission, anticipating maneuvering in the House and Senate
for mandatory AIDS testing and tracing of sexual partners, also
agreed to a resolution calling on Congress to block attempts to add
AIDS-policy amendments to appropriations bills.
   This method of attaching ``riders'' to appropriations bills is
often used to win approval of measures that could not be approved in
the normal legislative process.
   Osborn said that based on ``past patterns of behavior and
rumors,'' commissioners expect that the parliamentary tactic will be
attempted again this year as Congress completes action on spending
bills for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   ``We would like to be sure that AIDS policy is taken very
seriously,'' she said.

<HEAD>Kissinger Videotaped Testimony Delayed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Tuesday delayed the use of videotaped
testimony from former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the
libel trial of journalist Seymour Hersh, who is accused of defaming
a former Indian prime minister.
   Moraji Desai, who was Indian prime minister from 1977 to 1979,
filed a civil libel lawsuit against Hersh, claiming he was libeled
in Hersh's 1983 book, ``The Price of Power,'' about Kissinger.
   Hersh wrote that Desai served as a paid CIA informant.
   U.S. District Court Judge Charles Norgle called an early recess
Tuesday after Hersh's lawyers said they would object to Desai's
attorneys showing the jury a one-hour taped deposition by Kissinger.
   Lawyers were to present arguments on the admissibility of
Kissinger's taped testimony on Wednesday.
   Kissinger is scheduled to deliver a speech in Chicago on
Wednesday, and might be subpoenaed to testify if the judge bars the
use of the taped testimony, said John Omeara, one of Desai's
attorneys.
   Desai's lawsuit was filed in Chicago in accordance with the
tradition of filing defamation actions in the hometown of the
defendant. Hersh was born in Chicago, but now lives in Washington,
D.C.
   Omeara said Kissinger's testimony could be instrumental to the
case.
   ``It says that, to the best of his knowledge, (Desai) couldn't be
the spy,'' Omeara said, after Tuesday's court session.
   Hersh's lawyers have indicated that they consider Kissinger's
testimony to be invalid and based on hearsay.
   Earlier in the day, Desai's lawyers finished showing excerpts
from 81 hours of videotaped depositions made by Desai during visits
to Chicago in 1984-85.
   Desai, 94, was too ill to travel from India to Chicago to testify
in the trial, said his lawyer, Cyriac Kappil.
   In his deposition, Desai said he met with President Johnson at
least twice in 1968 and with Kissinger once in 1969 in India, but
said he could not recall what they spoke about.
   In excerpts shown Monday, Desai said he had met with top U.S.
officials, but insisted that he did not reveal any secret
information.
   Bernard Nussbaum, an attorney for Hersh, said Monday that the
author had six independent sources who claimed Desai, a bitter enemy
of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, received $20,000 a year as a
CIA informant.
   Nussbaum said the Indian politician cooperated with the CIA
because he was opposed to Ms. Gandhi's close relations with the
Soviet Union and her preparations for the 1971 war with Pakistan.
   Under U.S. libel law, Desai's attorneys must convince jurors that
Hersh knowingly printed false, negligent or malicious material.
   Hersh won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1970
for his articles exposing the My Lai massacre in Vietnam when he was
a reporter for the Dispatch News Service. He was also a reporter for
The Associated Press and for The New York Times. He left the
newspaper to pursue his own writing projects.

   Members of the Communications Workers of America
have ratified a new three-year contract with Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co.
   Workers in five states _ Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and
Texas _ approved the contract by a 4-1 margin, Burlene Leininger,
spokeswoman for District 6 of the CWA said Tuesday.
   Negotiators reached a tentative agreement on the pact Aug. 13,
avoiding a threatened strike by some 41,000 Southwestern Bell
workers.
   The pact included a 5.25 percent wage increase the first year,
including a $1,000 cash bonus, and a 2.25 percent increase in the
second and third years. It also includes a cost of living allowance.
   The company dropped an attempt to make employees pay a portion of
health insurance premiums for dependents, officials said, but there
were some increases in certain health care costs.
   Southwestern Bell has 11 million customers in its five-state
area. The last strike by its workers was in 1983, before divestiture
by American Telephone and Telegraph Co. Southwestern Bell is one of
the so-called Baby Bells created by the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;T.

   The battleship New Jersey fired its 16-inch
guns on Tuesday, the second battleship to do so since 47 sailors
were killed in an April explosion aboard the USS Iowa.
   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Mark Baker said the New Jersey fired its
weapons successfully off the California coast.
   The ship's nine guns in three turrets each fired three times,
resulting in 27 successful rounds.
   The firing was approved by the Pacific Fleet Commander, Adm.
David Jeremiah, Baker said.
   He said the firing of the guns was approved after the ship had
completed an ``extensive review'' of its ordnance certification and
training procedures, as called for following the Navy investigation
into the April 19 explosion in the Iowa's No. 2 turret.
   The investigation was unable to pinpoint a cause but did cite
gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig, captain of the middle gun, as the
``most likely'' person to have caused the disaster.
   The Iowa first test-fired the 16-inch guns in its No. 1 and No. 3
turrets on Aug. 4 while deployed in the Mediterranean.
   All Iowa-clas ships were prohibited from firing their guns
immediately after the explosion, but that decision was modified in
June to allow for ``live-fire training ... to prepare for
contingency operations as directed by fleet commanders,'' the Navy
said.
   The Navy has four battleship of the Iowa class. Each of the guns
can fire projectiles weighing up to 2,700 pounds at a maximum range
of 23 miles.

fake weapons used, details. No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS PALMAS, Canary Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hijacker forced a Moroccan
twin-engine plane to fly from the Western Sahara to Grand Canary
Island on Tuesday, then gave up after holding eight people hostage
for hours, a Spanish official said.
   The official, Eligio Hernandez, told a news conference the arms
brandished by Mohamed Abdallah Bin Namou were fake _ a toy pistol
and a phony grenade.
   He identified Bin Namou, 37, as a city employee from El Aaiun in
the disputed Moroccan territory of Western Sahara and said police
were holding Bin Namou pending charges.
   Hernandez said the man forced the crew of the Royal Air Maroc
ATR-42 turboprop to fly to the Canaries after it left Smara in the
Western Sahara on a regularly scheduled flight to El Aaiun.
   Bin Namou let the six passengers leave unharmed two hours after
the plane made an emergency landing at Gando Airport, and gave
himself up to police unconditionally two hours and 35 minutes after
that, Hernandez said.
   He said the two crew members were freed unharmed when Bin Namou
surrendered.
   Earlier, a police officer at the airport said the plane carried
four crew.
   Moroccan King Hassan II is to make his first official visit to
Spain on Sunday, and both Hernandez and Spanish Foreign Minister
Francisco Fernandez Ordonez confirmed that Bin Namou had demanded
that a letter concerning the visit be made public.
   Hernandez said the letter seemed motivated more by religious than
political beliefs but gave no details.
   In Rabat, the Moroccan capital, the airline referred to hijacker
as ``mentally unstable.''
   Grand Canary Island, 135 miles west of the Western Sahara in the
Atlantic, is part of the seven-island chain that is one of Spain's
17 autonomous regions.
   Spain abandoned its colony in the Western Sahara in 1975, and
Hassan sent thousands of civilians to occupy the area. The Polisario
National Liberation Front also claims the Western Sahara and has
waged a desert guerrilla war against the Moroccan army since 1975.
   Morocco and the Polisario have accepted in principle a
U.N.-supervised referendum to determine the fate of the
102,700-square-mile territory inhabited by about 73,000 mainly
nomadic Western Saharans.
   In Madrid, Polisario spokesman Ahmed Hash said his organization
had nothing to do with the hijacking.

<HEAD>Government List of Significant Films Draws Favorable Response</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Film Registry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Library of Congress' list of 25 films
deemed ``culturally, historically or esthetically significant'' drew
generally favorable reviews Tuesday from James Stewart, Billy Wilder
and other film industry figures.
   ``I'm delighted,'' said Wilder, whose ``Some Like It Hot'' and
``Sunset Boulevard'' are listed. ``I wish things would go forward to
reconstruct those films as they were, not colorized and not
butchered by cuts.''
   ``The first thing that crossed my mind,'' said Stewart, who
starred in the Frank Capra film ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,''
also on the list, ``is that I'm glad that Frank is still with us and
can enjoy his vindication.''
   ``I think it's a terrific list; I'd like to see all of them,''
commented George Kirgo, president of the Writers Guild of America.
``The only omission I see is `The Apartment,' but Billy Wilder is
pretty well represented.''
   ``I'm so happy these 25 films have been selected,'' said Arthur
Hiller, president of the Directors Guild of America. ``I'd be even
happier if more films could have been selected, as the
(Congressional) bill intended. I'd be happiest if there were no need
for a bill, and the moral rights of all artists not to have their
works altered or defaced would be protected.''
   The major surprise among the selections for the new National Film
Registry was the 1969 ``The Learning Tree,'' a semi-autobiographical
film of a black boy's rural childhood by Gordon Parks, famed Life
magazine photographer.
   ``I'm surprised, pleasantly so,'' said Parks at his New York
residence. ``I'm very happy. The film was very well received in its
release, and it's still playing in Europe and on television here.''
   The National Film Registry is the outgrowth of protests by
filmmakers over the colorization and the editing for television of
classic films. Congress last year passed the National Film
Preservation Act which called for the naming of 25 classic films
annually for three years.
   ``I'm delighted to be one of the 25, but I'm horrified at the
necessity of the act,'' said Stanley Donen, the director of the
musical ``Singin' in the Rain.''
   Donen said that the act will do nothing to keep broadcasters from
editing movies for length or duplicating them with poor quality
control onto videocassettes.
   The aim, said Librarian of Congress James H. Bilington in
announcing the first 25 Tuesday, was to help promote movies as an
American art form and generate public interest in preserving films.
   ``I think it's as good a list as we can expect the first time
out,'' said Dave Kehr, a member of the National Film Preservation
Board and chairman of the National Society of Film Critics. ``It's a
very safe, conservative list. ... I wish the list had been a little
more reflective of bread and butter Hollywood.''
   Said film critic Leonard Maltin: ``I feel that they've chosen
such generally outstanding titles that whatever omissions one could
argue this year will be rectified next year if not the year after.''
   A board of 13 film figures made the final selection, drawing from
a thousand nominations from the public.
   Jimmy Stewart made his comments in Washington, D.C., between a
bookstore signing for his new volume of poetry and a visit to the
Senate to campaign for more protection for films. He recalled the
premiere of ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' at Constitution Hall in
1939. The invited senators became restive at the film's depiction of
political corruption.
   The film broke during the screening, Stewart recalled, and by the
time Capra returned to his seat after climbing to the projection
booth to repair it, ``half his audience was gone. ... The press was
completely against the picture, too.''
   ``The main thing is that Frank is still here to enjoy his
vindication,'' said the actor. Capra has been in failing health at
his home in La Quinta, Calif.
   Wilder was his usual acerbic self in calling for greater
protection for films: ``The television people call in a butcher, who
has failed at the Ralphs grocery store, to supervise the cutting of
pictures so they can slip in the Noxema commercials. Frankly, nobody
gives a ----.''
   The list of 25 offers some surprises, especially ``The Learning
Tree,'' as well as glaring omissions.
   D.W. Griffith's mishmash of history, ``Intolerance,'' was
selected, but not his great classic, ``The Birth of a Nation,''
perhaps because of its sympathetic portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan.
   King Vidor's ``The Crowd'' was included but not his more
impressive achievement, ``The Big Parade.'' John Ford Westerns are
represented by ``The Searchers'' and not his landmark ``Stagecoach.''
   Other debatable choices: Robert Flaherty's 1922 documentary,
``Nanook of the North''; Stanley Kubrick's 1964 ``Dr. Strangelove'';
F. W. Murnau's 1927 ``Sunrise.'' Among the missing: ``The Treasure
of the Sierra Madre''; ``It's a Wonderful Life''; ``It Happened One
Night''; ``All about Eve''; ``Shane''; ``Top Hat''; ``The African
Queen''; ``Rebecca''; ``From Here to Eternity.''
   Besides Wilder, double selections were Victor Fleming, who
directed both ``Gone with the Wind'' and ``The Wizard of Oz'' in
1939, and Ford, ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and ``The Searchers.''

   Consumer prices did not rise at all last month
as big declines in the cost of gasoline and women's clothing
combined to provide the best news on inflation since early 1986, the
government said Tuesday.
   The August performance of the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index followed modest increases of 0.2 percent in both June and July
and left analysts marveling at the better-than-expected showing on
inflation.
   ``The August inflation result was outstanding from the point of
view of the consumer,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the
Boston Co. ``The bread-and-butter categories of food, housing,
transportation and clothing showed either big declines or very small
increases.''
   The modest price increases starting in June represented a sharp
contrast from the first part of the year, when surges in energy and
food costs pushed inflation up to a disturbing annual rate of 6.7
percent.
   With the string of good reports, consumer prices are now rising
at an annual rate of 4.8 percent, up only slightly from the 4.4
percent increases registered in both 1987 and 1988.
   The inflation rate fell by 0.3 percent in April 1986.
   In another economic report Tuesday, the government said that
construction of new homes and apartments dropped by 5 percent in
August, falling to an annual rate of 1.35 million units.
   Economists blamed increases in mortgage rates during August for
the setback. They said that the improved outlook for inflation
should help push mortgage rates down in coming months and should
keep the housing market from going into a tailspin.
   ``Builders saw rates rising and got a case of the jitters, but we
think that interest rates will start moving down again in the months
ahead as various indicators suggest that the inflation threat is
subsiding very quickly,'' said Richard Peach, senior economist at
the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   The Bush administration is predicting a 5 percent inflation rate
for this year, a view supported by many private economists, who
believe that recent increases in crude oil prices will translate
into slighlty higher monthly inflation numbers for the remainder of
the year.
   ``We think that inflation is probably going to move up a little
bit, but we are not looking for anything like the surge we had at
the beginning of 1989,'' said David Berson, chief economist of the
Federal National Mortgage Corp.
   Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at
Georgia State University, said that the underlying inflation rate is
running between 4 percent and 4.5 percent, where it has been for
much of this decade.
   For August, the main moderating force on prices was a steep 4.2
percent plunge in gasoline prices. It was the biggest one-month
decrease in pump prices in three years and followed smaller declines
of 1 percent in June and 2.2 percent in July. Gasoline prices had
shot up 21.2 percent in the first five months of the year.
   Also holding down prices was a 1.5 percent drop in clothing
prices in August, led by a big drop in women's clothing costs. The
decline was credited to larger than normal end-of-season price cuts
and the effect of the stronger dollar, which makes imported goods
less expensive.
   Food costs, which shot up at an annual rate of 9.3 percent at the
beginning of the year because of the lingering effects of the 1988
drought, were well behaved in August, posting a small 0.2 percent
rise.
   Declines in the cost of pork, poultry, fruits and vegetables
helped offset higher prices for beef, fish and eggs.
   Overall transportation costs fell 1.5 percent in August,
reflecting not only the drop in gasoline prices but also declines in
the cost of new and used cars.
   One of the few categories failing to show price moderation during
the month was the cost of medical care, which climbed by 0.7 percent
for the fourth month in a row.
   The price of all goods and services excluding food and energy
rose just 0.2 percent last month, a modest increase which gave
analysts encouragement that the underlying inflation rate is
returning to a more moderate pace as well.
   Analysts said despite the good inflation news, they were not
looking for any immediate move on the part of the Federal Reserve to
lower interest rates. They said that despite the moderating
inflationary pressures, the Fed was under no pressure to cut
interest rates because the overall economy is moving ahead at a
healthy clip.
   The various changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at
124.6 in August, meaning that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods
costing $100 in the base period of 1982-84 would have cost $124.60
last month.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker assured his
followers he ``would not lie to you about anything'' in excerpts of
his television shows viewed Tuesday by jurors at his fraud trial.
   The jury is being shown eight hours culled from broadcasts of
Bakker's ``PTL Show,'' much of it dealing with ``lifetime
partnerships.'' Followers were asked to buy $1,000 partnerships,
guaranteeing three nights' lodging a year for life at PTL's Heritage
USA theme park in Fort Mill, S.C.
   ``I'm sincere, I would not lie to you about anything,'' Bakker
told viewers in one excerpt. ``Mr. IRS got to me first, Uncle Sam
just took everything we could scrape together. Next month will be a
little better for me.''
   In a 1984 videotape, Bakker urged his audience to pay for
partnerships with a credit card, saying he bought his with a credit
card because he didn't have any cash. That same year, prosecutors
said, Bakker received $1 million in salary and bonuses and bought a
Palm Desert, Calif., home and a Rolls-Royce.
   Bakker is accused of diverting more than $3.7 million in PTL
money raised from ``lifetime partnership'' sales to pay for personal
luxuries. If found guilty of the 24 counts against him, Bakker could
be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined more than $5 million.
   The jury saw about six hours of the videotapes on Tuesday, and
were expected to begin viewing more of the tapes on Wednesday, after
which the prosecution is expected to rest its case.
   In a December 1984 videotape, Bakker was shown saying, `If I ever
see anyone at this place robbing or stealing, they are going to
jail,'' to which someone in the courtroom audience shouted ``Amen.''
   In another broadcast, Bakker complained that more than 900 people
had used invalid credit cards or bad checks to buy partnerships.
Bakker reopened partnership sales in the Heritage Grand Hotel at
Heritage USA.
   ``Some people's credit cards did not go through and some people's
checks went through and through and through again. They bounced from
here to California,'' Bakker said.
   PTL also sold partnerships for another hotel at Heritage USA,
Towers Hotel. Sales were reopened in 1986, even though investigators
say more than 30,000 partnerships in the Towers Hotel already had
been sold. Bakker told viewers he had $8 million in unpaid bills on
the Towers.
   ``I'm going to give something that's the best bargain in the
world,'' Bakker said on a show recorded May 31, 1986. ``When you're
desperate, you do desperate things.''
   Witnesses called earlier in the trial have testified they bought
the partnerships but could not get rooms. Others have testified that
partnerships were oversold and that the money from such promotions
often was used to cover PTL's day-to-day operating costs rather than
finance construction of the guaranteed rooms and buildings.
   FBI agent John Pearson, who produced the tape, said more than
66,000 partnerships were sold to viewers by the time Bakker left PTL
in March 1987, despite a publicized limit of 25,000.

<HEAD>Many AIDS Patients Die of Malnutrition, Study Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Many AIDS patients die as a direct result of
simply wasting away because their bodies are unable to retain enough
food for adequate nourishment, according to a study released Tuesday
by a Columbia University researcher.
   ``Improving nutritional status provides a reasonable
expectation'' for prolonging life and maintaining the quality of
life for AIDS patients, reports Dr. Donald P. Kotler, an associate
professor at the Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons and
the St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital in New York.
   In a study published in the American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition, Kotler estimated that 70 percent to 80 percent of AIDS
patients die as a result of wasting away.
   In studying the process, Kotler uses a measurement called body
cell mass _ the weight of muscle and organs, excluding fat, bone and
water outside the cells.
   In a study 32 AIDS patients, patients died when the body-cell
mass dropped to an average of 54 percent of the ideal. The study
started 100 days before death when the average body-cell mass was 71
percent of the ideal.
   Body-cell mass gives a more accurate picture of the state of
malnutrition because patients can lose body-cell mass while not
losing weight dramatically, Kotler said.
   In a comments at a meeting Tuesday of the Federation of American
Societies of Experimental Biology, Kotler said the study did not
determine the precise mechanism that causes death due to
malnutrition among AIDS patients.
   ``We do not know whether death is due to a general cellular
starvation so that a critical number of cells stop functioning or
some critical organ, such as the brain, liver, kidneys or heart,
stops functioning,'' he said.
   Dr. C. Wayne Callaway of George Washington University told the
meeting that Kotler's study suggests that a control of malnutrition
among AIDS patients might prolong life.
   ``While we will have to wait on studies to prove that adequate
nutrition can prolong life in AIDS patients, from a doctor's point
of view, I consider it only responsible to treat patients with the
information that we have,'' said Callaway.
   Callaway said vomiting and diarrhea are the most common causes of
malnutrition among AIDS patients, and these symptoms often can be
treated with drugs or food selection that will improve nutrition.
   ``While nutrition does not solve the primary problem, the AIDS
viral infection, it can improve the quality of patients' lives,'' he
said. ``Many problems that cause malnutirition in AIDS patients are
treatable by fairly simple interventions.''
   In another report at the meeting, scientists from Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore reported that they cleared all detectable
signs of AIDS from a patient through a combination of radiation and
chemotherapy to kill the patient's bone marrow cells, AZT to prevent
the AIDS virus from invading new cells, and a bone marrow transplant.
   The patient, a 41-year-old man, died 46 days after the treatment
from a type of cancer, but no trace of AIDS genetic material could
be detected in tissue samples from the patient.
   ``Even though the patient died, we believe we demonstrated that
he was cleared of all signs of the AIDS virus,'' said Dr. Rein
Saral, a Johns Hopkins associate professor.
   He cautioned the results should not be interpreted as a ``cure''
for AIDS because the virus could still have been present in some
cells of the patient's body.

<HEAD>Two Suspected Collaborators Go on Rampage, 10 Injured in Fires</HEAD>

   Two brothers suspected of
collaborating with Israel went on a beating and stabbing rampage in
this Arab Christian town known as a stronghold of the Palestinian
uprising, witnesses said Tuesday.
   The incident was set off when the house of one brother was stoned
by masked youths. It reflected the growing tension between the
youthful enforcers of the 21-month-old uprising and Palestinians
accused to cooperating with Israel.
   In occupied Gaza City, soldiers shot and killed Amer Ahmad
Mansur, 21, Arab hospital officials reported. Military officials
confirmed the death and said a patrol fired after being attacked
with two firebombs, killing the attacker.
   In other clashes in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank,
Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 16 Palestinians, Arab doctors
said. The army command confirmed five wounded in Gaza and said it
was checking further.
   Authorities in Haifa, Israel, reported that 10 people were
injured, at least 1,700 acres of forest and grassland were burned
and a settlement was threatened Tuesday in a big forest arson attack.
   The fires began around noon on the slopes of Mt. Carmel and
threatened the kibbutz, or communal settlement, of Beit Oren.
   Officials there said 80 children and 40 adults were evacuated.
The fire also crept close to Haifa's Daniya neighborhood.
   Police later arrested two arson suspects, said Gideon Arbel,
deputy superintendent of the northern police district.
   In Beit Sahour, Mayor Hanna Al-Atrash was among the victims in
Monday night's rampage. He was reportedly pulled from his car and
held hostage for an hour. Al-Atrash was hospitalized Tuesday in
Jerusalem with bruises and a gashed head.
   In the melee, Palestinian youths set fire to the brothers' homes
and seriously damaged them, townspeople said.
   The army did not intervene in the incident in this town near
Bethlehem, but on Tuesday arrested a third brother for suspected
involvement in the fray, residents said. An army spokesman said he
had no information on the trouble in Beit Sahur.
   The fracas began Monday night when dozens of masked youths threw
bottles and stones at the house of Mahmoud Zahlan.
   According to residents in this town of 11,000 people, Zahlan and
his brother Mousa were active in the uprising but were converted
into informers while jailed for their activities in the revolt.
   After the stoning, witnesses said, the brothers and several
relatives got knives and clubs and went into the streets, stopping
cars and beating passengers.
   One victim was dragged from a car and stabbed in the shoulder,
arm and leg, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition their names
not be used. The mayor also was pulled from his car, then beaten at
Mahmoud Zahlan's house, townspeople said.
   The army meanwhile said it soon will assign ``monitors'' to units
in the occupied lands as a way of cutting down shooting wounds to
women and children during clashes with soldiers.
   An army spokeswoman, who cannot be identified by name under
military regulations, said the monitors would be assinged to watch
firing when women and children are present. She said they would be
assigned ``in the next few days.''
   More than 100 children under age 16 were among the 573
Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians since the
uprising against Israeli rule began in December 1987. Forty Israelis
also have died. At least 114 Arabs have been killed by fellow
Palestinians as suspected collaborators.

<TEXT>
   Ethiopia and the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front on Tuesday concluded nearly two weeks of negotiations, still
disputing who would chair talks to end their 28-year-old war but
expecting to resolve that and other remaining issues during a
meeting in November.
   The two sides will meet again Nov. 18 in Nairobi, Kenya, to
complete the preliminary talks that began Sept. 7 at The Carter
Center.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, an observer to the Atlanta talks,
said he hoped Ethiopia and the EPLF would iron out their differences
on preliminary issues and ratify a plan for substantative peace
talks at the Nairobi meeting.
   According to a joint communique issued Tuesday by the Ethiopian
and EPLF delegations, the two sides agreed to 13 items during the
Atlanta talks, which were held to develop a framework for peace
talks. Both sides also indicated a desire for Carter to play a
continuing role in peacemaking efforts.
   But differences remained over the chairmanship, observers and
staff for the future talks.
   Carter, Ethiopian delegation leader Ashegre Yigletu and Eritrean
delegation head Al-Amin Mohamed Saiyed said much progress had been
made during the Atlanta talks, but cautioned that an end to the war
is not imminent.
   ``Atlanta has been an arena within which they could build up
mutual trust,'' Carter said. ``Obviously, differences on major
issues are still there.
   ``For 28 years they have not been able to make this much
progress, and many hundreds of thousands of people have perished,''
he said.
   The items agreed to during the Atlanta talks were mostly
procedural, though the two sides did agree that the sites for the
peace talks will be rotated between Nairobi, Khartoum, Sana'a,
Cairo, Ashura and Harare. A date has not been set for the peace
talks.
   The duties and functions of the chairman or co-chairmen were
agreed upon. The Eritreans, however, want Carter to serve as
chairman with a co-chairman selected from among the heads of state
of the venue countries.
   Ethiopia wants two equal and permanent co-chairmen, with one
being an African leader.
   The two sides disagreed over whether observers may only be
representatives of nations, or if they may represent international
organizations.
   Earlier in the talks, the possibility was raised over whether a
cease-fire could be effected during the interim between the
preliminary discussions and the peace talks. Both sides Tuesday
declined to commit to such action before the peace talks.
   Combat and famine have combined to kill an estimated 1 million
people since Ethiopia and Eritrea went to war in 1961. Ethiopia
considers the war a battle of secession, while the Eritreans view
the war as a battle for independence.
   Eritrea, a northern province, was joined with Ethiopia in a
federation the Eritreans opposed. Eritrea provides Ethiopia's only
direct access to the Red Sea.
   After several attempts to arrange peace talks over the years
failed, the two sides earlier this year agreed for Carter to serve
as a neutral observer for preliminary discussions aimed at setting
an agenda for peace talks.
   The talks were suspended over the weekend while Carter traveled
to Nicaragua for a previously scheduled fact-finding mission before
that country's national elections. Carter plans to act as an
observer to the February voting.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Approves Amendment Seeking International Drift Net Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An amendment that would require the
administration to seek an international ban on high seas drift net
fishing was approved by a House subcommittee Tuesday.
   State Department officials said last week that while they thought
such a ban would eventually be discussed in an international forum,
the United States needed more data on the effects of drift net
fishing before pushing for one.
   ``There are those who say it is premature, but it would be
irresponsible to sit on our hands,'' said Rep. Jolene Unsoeld,
D-Wash., who sponsored the drift net amendment. ``We already know
our salmon are being stolen.''
   The data will be gathered under provisions of recently negotiated
agreements with Japan, Korea and Taiwan, the three nations with
drift net fleets operating in the Nouth Pacific.
   The amendment was attached to bill reauthorizing the so-called
Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Managment Act of 1976, which
created the 200-mile U.S. fishing zone and eight regional fisheries
councils to manage the ocean resources.
   The reauthorization bill adopted by the committee's fisheries and
wildlife conservation subcommittee requires the secretary of state
to seek ``as soon as possible'' an international drift net ban and
to report back to Congress in 18 months on the progress of
negotiations including a list of nations that have refused to talk.
   U.S. fishermen claim the drift net fleets, under the guise of
fishing for squid, are actually harvesting salmon in quantities that
have already caused a drop in Alaska, Washington state and Oregon
fish runs.
   Environmental groups have also claimed the nets are responsible
for the deaths of thousands of marine mammals, sea birds and other
marine animals annually.
   Subcommittee chairman Gerry Studds, D-Mass., said ``no other
fishing method is as destructive or indiscriminate'' as drift nets
and the legislation would ``set a national goal'' of banning drift
net fishing on the high seas.

   A former nursing home aide charged
with smothering five patients testified Tuesday that the alleged
murder plot was nothing more than a fictitious game that got out of
hand.
   The defense rested after the testimony of Gwendolyn Graham, who
is charged with five counts of first-degree murder and one count of
conspiracy to murder on allegations she suffocated incapacitated
patients at Alpine Manor Nursing Home in Walker between January and
April 1987.
   Defense and prosecution attorneys later finished their closing
arguments and the case went to the jury, which began deliberationa
before adjourning for the night. If convicted, Graham faces life in
prison without parole.
   Graham, 26, denied killing any patients or knowing of any murders
at the home.
   She testified that her former lesbian lover, nurse's aide
Catherine Wood, often concocted stories and spread rumors, and that
she usually went along to humor her. The alleged murder plot was one
of those ``head games,'' Graham said. ``At first it was a joke.''
   But when Graham began seeing another woman, she said Wood
threatened to ``make someone believe the story that we had been
killing patients.''
   Wood, 27, has pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree murder
and one count of conspiracy to murder. In exchange for her testimony
against Graham, two counts of first-degree murder were dropped. Wood
will be sentenced later.
   When police began investigating the deaths after Graham moved
back to her hometown of Tyler, Texas, with the other woman, she said
she realized that Wood ``was going to get even, just like she said
she was.''
   Graham's testimony disputed that of several of her friends and
former lovers, who testified that Graham, on separate occasions, had
admitted suffocating patients at the home.
   Graham said she did not admit killing patients, but related the
story as one Wood had made up. Graham said she only once claimed to
have suffocated patients in an effort to scare another woman, she
said.
   Graham said she decided to leave Wood for another lover because
``I was tired of playing games, hurting people. ... The games just
got out of hand.''
   Graham testified that Wood dominated their relationship, often
starting fights between Graham and other women and once threatening
Graham with a gun. The testimony contrasted Wood's account of the
affair.
   During closing arguments, the prosecutor told the jury that the
case was not a ``referendum on homosexuality.''
   Wood testified that Graham said the killings ``relieved tension.''

<HEAD>Four Coup Plotters Executed in Burkina Faso</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four men were executed after security
agents uncovered at the last minute a plot to overthrow President
Blaise Compaore, the official Burkina Faso News Agency said Tuesday.
   Two of the four were in the top echelon of the government, it
reported.
   The agency said agents thwarted the plotters' attempt to arrest
Compaore upon his return from a trip to China late Monday.
   Reached by telex from Abidjan, the agency quoted government
spokesman Clement Ouedraogo as saying the coup leaders planned to
seize the airport and if they met resistance, to shoot down
Compaore's plane when it approached.
   Ouedraogo spoke at a news conference Tuesday in Ouagadougou,
capital of the impoverished Sahelian nation. The agency said Burkina
Faso was calm, and that no fighting has taken place.
   Ouedraogo said Maj. Jean-Baptiste Boukary Lingani and Capt. Henri
Zongo, effectively the No. 2 and No. 3 men in Compaore's Popular
Front military government, were executed along with two other
military plotters, not identified.
   The agency quoted Ouedraogo as saying Capt. Gilbert Diendere, in
charge of presidential security, discovered the scheme just before
Compaore returned.
   The executions mark the final breakup of a clique of young
officers who came to power with Capt. Thomas Sankara in Aug. 4,
1983. Zongo and Lingani, like Compaore close friends of Sankara,
supported Compaore in his overthrow and killing of Sankara on Oct.
15, 1987.
   First word of the coup attempt came in a communique read on the
government-controlled radio. It said, ``Our people and revolution,
and its militants at all levels, have just escaped, on the night of
Sept. 18, 1989, a cowardly plot fomented by military and fascist
elements led by some ambitious and anti-revolutionary people who are
at the very top of the political leadership.''
   It specifically named Lingani and Zongo and said their objectives
``were to dissolve the Popular Front and all the political
organizations and to restore fascist authority.''
   Burkina Faso, victim of recurring droughts in the past two
decades, has experienced six military coups since independence from
France in 1960. It is listed by the World Bank as one of the world's
poorest nations with personal income averaging $190 in 1987.
   The West African nation has a population of about 6 million and
covers 105,870 square miles. More than 2 million Burkinabe have left
their country to seek work in Ivory Coast.

   A teen who held 11 students hostage pleaded
guilty Tuesday to kidnapping and endangerment charges and was placed
in state custody for psychological tests, and his classmates
expressed compassion instead of anger.
   ``Nobody seems mad at him,'' said James Issacs, a senior at
Jackson County High School, where the 10-hour standoff Monday ended
peacefully.
   Dustin Pierce, 17, pleaded guilty Tuesday to 13 counts of wanton
endangerment and 13 counts of kidnapping Tuesday, said LaDonna
Williams, a state police dispatcher in Richmond.
   The two additional charges involve a teacher who was released at
the start of the incident; and another student who was held
overnight.
   Police said Pierce took 11 hostages at his high school in a
desperate plea to see his distant father. State Police Detective Bob
Stephens said the incident was a plot directly from Stephen King's
thriller novel, ``Rage.''
   The book, found in Pierce's room at his grandparent's house,
centers on a teen-ager enraged with his father who takes hostages at
a school.
   Pierce, who was armed with two pistols and a shotgun, released
the hostages sporadically, then surrendered. Authorities arranged
for his father to come to Kentucky from his Florida home, but the
boy gave up before his father arrived.
   Interviews with Pierce's classmates and others in this town of
1,000 about 65 miles southeast of Lexington depicted a well-behaved,
quiet teen-ager, a straight-A student.
   ``It's just a mystery, the way it happened,'' said Bruce Neeley,
a Jackson County deputy sheriff. Neeley said officers never had any
problem with Pierce.
   ``He's a real good boy,'' he added.
   Eight counselors were brought to the high school to help students
deal with the aftermath of the hostage-takinga. Pierce blew out a
classroom window with a shotgun blast shortly after taking over his
world civilization class.
   Neither Pierce nor any of the hostages were injured.
   ``Everybody is feeling sorry for him and what he's going
through,'' said Shane Harrison, 17. He said he hoped Pierce would
receive help ``to see what caused it and prevent it from ever
happening again.''
   Betty Bond, principal at the 500-student school, said students
voiced their concern for Pierce rather than anger.
   ``They're already wanting to know if we have heard from (Pierce)
today, how he's doing, can we send him a card, a letter, a video,
anything to let him know that we still care about him, that he is
still our friend,'' said Mrs. Bond.
   She expected students to show some compassion for the youth, but
said she was surprised ``for it to be as strong as it is.''
   Pierce was placed in the custody of the state Cabinet for Human
Resources for psychological tests. He was taken to a treatment
center in Louisville after pleading guilty Tuesday.

<HEAD>NRC Won't Stop Decommissioning Work at Shoreham</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission sees no need
to stop Long Island Lighting Co. from getting ready to decommission
the new Shoreham nuclear power plant in New York, the commission
said in a letter released Tuesday.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has vowed to try to keep the
plant intact, and had asked the commission to stop the company from
dsiabling the reactor before the commission could rule on the
transfer of its operating license to local and state authorities for
decommissioning.
   ``Although LILCO has indicated its intent not to operate Shoreham
and the agreement between LILCO and the state of New York indicates
an intent to decommission the facility, thus far the activities that
LILCO is carrying out are authorized under the existing license,''
Kenneth M. Carr, the commission chairman, said in a Sept. 15 letter
to Watkins.
   Watkins has also called for a full environmental review of the
shutdown plan in an effort to compel New York to keep the plant in
mothballs.
   Carr assured Watkins that the plant would not be allowed to
deteriorate while the commission considers whether to transfer its
license to the Long Island Power Authority. That authority plans to
hire the New York Power Authority to do the actual decommissioning
work.
   The company has removed fuel from the reactor and cut staff,
spurring complaints from Watkins. Carr wrote, ``We do not believe
that reduction in staff at the facility warrants enforcement or
sanction.''
   The fully licensed plant, about 50 miles east of New York City,
has never operated commercially. Gov. Mario Cuomo negotiated a plan
to buy the plant for $1 in order to tear it down, maintaining that
the area could not be safely evacuated in the event of an accident.
In return, LILCO will get a decade of approximately 5 percent annual
rate increases.

   Forecasters consulted computers, satellites and
yellowing hurricane charts Tuesday in a frantic effort to plot the
course of Hurricane Hugo, which might hit the United States this
weekend.
   Then again, it might not.
   ``When you look out two to three days in the future, that's when
we have our most difficult problems,'' said Bob Sheets, director of
the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables. ``We have a
lot of different things going on.''
   Forecasters said U.S. residents from the Florida Keys to North
Carolina should watch Hugo's uncertain path carefully. The
hurricane, leaving devastation behind in the Caribbean, was moving
past the Bahamas and could affect Florida by Friday, forecasters
said.
   They added, however, that it could also miss the United States
entirely.
   A variety of weather factors, some as far away as Canada and the
Rocky Mountains, could determine Hugo's course. But the most likely
effect will come from the combination of a low-pressure system
moving west across southern Georgia and a broad high-pressure ridge,
the ``Bermuda High,'' to Hugo's north.
   The high-pressure system probably will block Hugo from spinning
harmlessly out into the Atlantic, as Hurricane Gabrielle did last
week, forecasters said, while the low-pressure system could lure
Hugo westward.
   Forecasters said the varying factors also would affect the
storm's strength, which was slowly rebuilding Tuesday after falling
from 140 mph winds to 105 mph.
   Forecasters watched data spit out of advanced computers, studied
satellite maps and reconnaissance photos flown back on Air Force
``hurricane hunter'' planes, and even pulled out old hurricane
charts to see what storms similar to Hugo have done.
   ``We were just looking through a bunch of the old charts,''
Sheets said. ``They've done everything. They've done loopity-loops,
they've gone into south Florida, they've gone into central Florida,
all the way up to the Carolinas.''
   An Air Force reconnaissance crew that flew into Hugo Tuesday said
the eye was about 30 to 40 miles across and the pressure had risen
to about 965 millibars _ a sign of weakening.
   ``It's weaker than in the past few days, but it's still a
significant hurricane,'' said Air Force Capt. Dave Carlisle.
   Hurricane David, a destructive hurricane that hit eastern
Caribbean islands 10 years ago, swept past Puerto Rico, hit the
island of Hispaniola, moved through the western Bahamas, then made
landfall on Florida's middle east coast.
   So far, Hugo has moved from the eastern Caribbean across Puerto
Rico, then away from Hispaniola and was headed slightly east of the
Bahamas.
   Computer models that use all available weather data, past records
and physics equations were laying out conflicting futures for Hugo,
Sheets said.
   The best advice forecasters could offer, Sheets said, was for
coastal residents across the southeastern United States to be ready.

   The Air Force said Tuesday failure to remove
an improperly manufactured vent plug during refueling of a B-52
bomber led to a fuel spill and explosion in July that killed one
person and injured 11.
   The vent plug, used during pressure checks, was mistakenly left
in place causing over-pressurization and a spill, said Maj. Gen.
Richard D. Smith, commander of the San Antonio Air Logistics Command
at Kelly Air Force Base.
   ``In the most layman's terms, we filled up a balloon, and there
was no place for the air to go and it ruptured,'' Smith said at a
news conference.
   Jesus Pedraza, a worker, was killed and three of 11 injured
people were hospitalized after the July 24 nighttime accident.
   The lengthy Accident Investigation Report on the fire did not
determine a cause of the blaze, which charred the B-52, one of
several aircraft serviced at Kelly, and did total damage estimated
at $15.8 million, according to the report.
   Smith said a differently designed vent plug was used at Kelly
before the accident. Although there was technical data within the
Air Force indicating the design was faulty, that was not determined
until after the explosion, he said.
   A new design is now used on vent plugs at Kelly, Smith said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, sharing a platform with
House Speaker Tom Foley at a centennial tree-planting ceremony,
prodded the Democratic-controlled Congress on Tuesday to move more
quickly on his clean-air proposals.
   Bush challenged Democratic leaders to finish work on his proposed
overhaul of the Clean Air Act of 1974 this year _ a target Foley,
the nation's top-ranking elected Democrat, had called possible but
``unlikely.''
   Suggesting his legislation had been languishing in House and
Senate committees, Bush declared, ``Every day that passes is another
day we're postponing progress on clean air.''
   To a crowd of several thousand sprawled on the banks of the
Spokane River under bright skies in Foley's hometown, Bush said,
``We need action on the legislation we've proposed _ now.
   ``We've brought people together and put a sound proposal on the
table. Now it's up to Congress to pass this clean-air legislation
this year.''
   Bush's proposals call for tougher standards on acid rain, urban
smog and industrial emissions.
   In Washington, the president's backers won an important victory
in the envrionment subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee. A 12-10 vote turned rejected an amendment to the
president's clean air package backed by environmental groups that
Bush supporters argued would be too tough on cities and small
businesses.
   The Democratic chairman of the parent committee, Rep. John
Dingell of Michigan, is backing the president's plan.
   Meanwhile, the president issued in a statement expressing
``concern and sympathy'' for victims of Hurricane Hugo. Spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said ``all necessary federal resources will be
quickly mobilized to help the people of the Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico recover from this disaster.''
   In advance of Bush's speech, Foley said that the House planned to
move forward on Bush's clean-air legislation but that action this
year was ``possible but unlikely.''
   ``If I were prudent, I would say early next year,'' Foley told
reporters Monday, also predicting that the House would modify the
proposal.
   Bush, accompanied by Environmental Protection Administration
chief William Reilly, made the excursion into Foley's congressional
district for a ceremony marking Washington's 100th anniversary as a
state. It was the final stop on a two-day swing that included
similar centennial observations in South Dakota and Montana.
   Foley, who told the crowd Bush's visit was ``a proud moment for
the state of Washington,'' sat impassively through the president's
remarks directed at Congress. But the speaker clapped politely when
Bush's call for action this year prompted a wave of applause from
the crowd.
   Despite needling the Democratic leadership, Bush praised Foley in
the speech as ``a man of integrity, decency, fair play. OK, he's a
Democrat. But he's a man I am very proud to be able to work with.''
   Flying back to Washington aboard Air Force One, Foley told
reporters, ``I don't think the president really expects that every
time he should send a proposal to the Congress, we would just
automatically say, `Well, this is better than anyone could possible
improve on, therefore we'll enact it without any question or without
any additions.'''
   Asked about Bush's complaint Monday that the Democrats' response
to his drug strategy and other initiatives is always to ``spend more
and raise taxes,'' Foley replied:
   ``Well, with the greatest respect since I'm flying in his
airplane, I don't agree with the suggestion that we are trying to
tax more or to spend more.''
   Foley also said he thinks Bush will eventually lose the fight
over reducing the capital gains tax, despite the president's initial
victory in the House Ways and Means Committee.
   ``We're going to do our best on the floor of the House and the
Senate to defeat the proposal, which I think is unwise and
ill-timed, unfair. ... This is one in which the president and we
have a very clear disagreement. And we'll have an alternative
proposal to consider when it reaches the House floor.''
   Bush, who has planted a tree and stressed environmental themes at
each stop, called for ``a new environmental awareness on the part of
all Americans.''
   Saying pollution isn't caused just by power plants and large
industries, Bush proposed a major volunteer effort on the part of
all Americans to ``generate less wastes and recycle more of the
waste that is generated.''
   He said the ``opportunity to renew the environmental ethic in
America'' was ``an opportunity we can't afford to miss.''
   ``I plan to stay involved, helping to protect our precious
environment, as long as I am president,'' he asserted.
   Bush's clean-air proposals were announced June 12 but not
formally submitted to Congress until July 21.
   The package calls for a 10-billion-ton reduction in sulfur
dioxide emissions from power plant and other industrial stacks by
the year 2000.
   Sulfur dioxide pollution drifts in the atmosphere with prevailing
winds and returns to earth as acid rain.
   Bush's plan also calls for a 2-million-ton reduction in nitrogen
oxide emissions and a 40 percent reduction in hydrocarbon emissions,
which produce urban smog.
   Bush, as he has done in other centennial states, planted in
Spokane's Riverfront Park _ site of a 1974 world's fair _ a sapling
from a White House elm planted by President John Quincy Adams in
1828.
   In Washington, meanwhile, the administration proposed a
modification in the provision of its clean-air bill that would
permit automakers to average auto emissions to meet anti-pollution
requirements.
   The modification, criticized by environmental groups, would still
allow motor vehicle manufacturers to meet stricter anti-pollution
requirements by averaging pollution among engine families.
   But it would make clear that reductions under averaging must
equal the improvement that would be achieved if each model were
forced to meet the emissions standards. Current law requires each
model to meet the standards.

<HEAD>Sheriff's Anti-Gang Scout Slain In Drive-By Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sheriff's Explorer Scout who touted the
anti-gang message was shot down half a block from his home in a
drive-by shooting, a victim of the raging violence he fought to stop.
   No arrests had been made Tuesday afternoon in the slaying of
Anthony Jerome Gardner, 19, who was shot to death at 1:15 p.m.
Monday by several gang members inside a Cadillac, said Deputy Chris
Wahla.
   Gardner was hit several times in the chest and died at Robert F.
Kennedy Memorial Hospital.
   ``He's seen the streets, he knows what's out there. He knew what
the risks were,'' said Deputy Danny Bullock, an adviser for the
Explorer Scout program at the sheriff's station in Carson, where
Gardner worked as a volunteer.
   Gardner, a minister's son who aspired to a career with the
sheriff's department, had received death threats from gang members,
neighbors said.
   He diligently warned children and residents to stay indoors when
street thugs were on the prowl.
   ``Anthony was very strong on assisting others in staying out of
gang associations,'' said Carson Sgt. Tom Diviak, supervisor in
charge of the scouts. ``He was very outspoken against gangs, that's
the best way of putting it.''
   Bullock stressed that scouts are not told to take a stance
against street hoodlums because of the danger they could face.
   ``We really warn them against telling anyone of their even being
an Explorer,'' Bullock said. ``Anthony did this on his own. He
donated a lot of his time helping deputies. He was a second pair of
eyes in the (patrol) vehicle.''
   Gardner, who planned to enter the Sheriff's Academy on Nov. 17,
conducted his own patrols in his crime-ridden South Los Angeles
neighborhood, said Deputy Bill Wehner.
   Damion Muldrew, 12, said Gardner had warned neighborhood kids
just days before about possible gang retaliation because of his
warnings. ``He said watch out, some gang bangers were trying to kill
him,'' Muldrew said.
   A University High School student who graduated with a 3.7 grade
point average, Gardner became an Explorer Scout in 1986. After
completing the youth citizenship training program, he worked as a
volunteer at the Carson station.
   Gardner also was an active member of the Independent Baptist
Church, where his father, the Rev. Donald Gardner, preached.

   Joseph Garba of Nigeria, a retired army
general who once served in a U.N. peackeeping force, on Tuesday
became president of the General Assembly.
   In a news conference prior to Tuesday's opening of the United
Nation's 44th session, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said, ``I think that in the present General Assembly, there are
subjects of great importance politically. There is Namibia, the
Middle East, Afghanistan, Iran-Iraq, Kampuchea (Cambodia), Western
Sahara, Central America, and Cyprus.
   ``On the social aspect, I think it is extremely important that
this year the General Assembly gives importance to real social
questions. Not only human rights, which always is reserved in first
place in our concerns, but the environment, AIDS and terrorism,'' he
said.
   Rain forests were added to the agenda by environmentalists who
pushed 12 wheelbarrows into the marble lobby of the U.N.
headquarters and dumped petitions with 3 million signatures asking
the world body to save the forests.
   Organizers from the World Rainforest Movement refused to leave
without personally meeting Perez de Cuellar. U.N. officials,
confronted by mounds of paper that the organizers said were
petitions from 23 countries, arranged a meeting with the
secretary-general.
   He met with a delegation of representatives from Malaysia, Brazil
India and Britain.
   The Malaysia-based World Rainforest Movement, which says it
represents 60 nongovernmental organizations, is seeking a special
General Assembly session to halt the destruction of rain forests.
   A special session of the 159-nation assembly only can be called
at the request of a majority of its member governments and a costly
special session is considered unlikely.
   Garba, 46, is Nigeria's ambassador to the United Nations.
   He is a former foreign minister and has been chairman of the U.N.
Special Committee Against Apartheid and the U.N. Special Committee
on Peacekeeping Operations.
   Under a system of rotating regional representation, the African
nations nominated the assembly president this year and Garba was
chosen over Paul Engo, Cameroon's ambassador.
   Garba retired from the army in 1980 with the rank of major
general.
   In his address to the assembly he said, ``At the age of 22, as a
captain in the Nigerian army, I participated in the U.N.
India-Pakistan Observer Mission, where I donned the blue helmet for
the first time. That operation enabled me to appreciate first-hand
the laudable role of the United Nations in conflict resolutions.''
   That observer group has monitored the truce between Pakistan and
India since 1949.
   Garba said international peace cannot be secure in a world in
which nations' economies are in decline and inequity exists between
classes and states.
   ``There is now widespread recognition that the external debt
crisis has economic, political and social consequences,'' he said.
   He called for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as
well as major donor countries to provide resources for debt
reduction.

<TEXT>
   Colombia has issued arrest warrants for
two Israelis accused of training hit squads for the drug cartels
waging war on the government, an official said Tuesday.
   Acting on a request by the Department of Administrative Security,
Colombia's equivalent of the FBI, a judge issued the warrants Monday
night for a former Israeli army colonel, Yair Klein, and businessman
Arik Acek.
   ``They are wanted for violating laws against conspiring, teaching
and enlisting civilians in military operations without the approval
of the Defense Ministry,'' said security department spokeswoman
Divas Rojas.
   An Israeli Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Israel has no extradition treaty with Colombia. ``The
ambassador has been very clear about this,'' he added.
   He said Israeli police have concluded an investigation into the
Klein case and the Supreme Court there has to decide what, if any
action to take. Five other Israelis suspected of training gunmen for
the cartels also were investigated.
   Ms. Rojas said Klein and Acek are thought to have entered
Colombia in August 1988 and to have left the country this year after
reports surfaced that foreign mercenaries were training private
armies for the drug lords, mostly in the Magadelena Medio region in
mountainous, central Colombia.
   British Ambassador Richard Neilson said on Colombian TV on
Tuesday that British and Colombian intelligence had information in
March about British and Israeli mercenaries training assassination
squads for the cartels.
   ``The governmemt of Colombia had information about British
mercenaries in Colombia in March and we were in position to help
them (the government),'' he said.
   He said Britain will try to extradite any British who helped
traffickers train paramilitary groups, but it was not known how many
British may have been involved.
   Klein, now home in Tel Aviv, has said he trained Colombian
farmers to protect themselves against leftist guerrillas. He said he
was unaware they had any involvement with drugs.
   In the northern coastal city of Barranquilla, an army raid
Tuesday in the house of the manager of a milk company turned up a
ton of pure cocaine. Four people were arrested. The owner, Pedro
Rodriguez Munoz, was not at home.
   In Venezuela, police said they would release a man who was
arrested at a ranch near the Colombian border because he bore a
``strong resemblance'' to Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a top leader
of Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Humberto Giffuni, deputy director of Venezuela's Judicial
Technical Police, said the man and three people arrested with him
Monday would be freed immediately.
   The drug war took a new twist Monday night when a bomb went off
in front of a crowded shopping center in the capital, Bogota.
Another bomb damaged a Bogota telephone company outlet.
   It was the first time a bomb was placed in the early evening in a
populated area. Four people, including a child, were injured.
   Since the crackdown on drug cartels was launched, most bombing
targets have been banks and government buildings and most explosions
went off late at night, when no one was around.
   In the past three weeks, 45 bombs have gone off in Colombia,
killing four people and injuring 118. No one claimed responsibility,
but officials blamed drug barons.
   President Virgilio Barco announced the crackdown after leading
presidential candidate Sen. Luis Carlos Galan was assassinated Aug.
18.
   Barco vowed to extradite traffickers wanted in the United States.
   Colombian Eduardo Martinez Romero was extradited Sept. 6 to
Atlanta in connection with the laundering of more than $1.2 billion
for the Medellin cartel.
   Two other alleged drug traffickers were arrested last week and
await extradition to the United States.
   But drug kingpins on the United States' list of the most wanted,
the so-called ``Dirty Dozen,'' remain at large and there is no
indication the government is close to arresting them.
   Colombia's attorney general, Alfonseo Gomez Mendez, said Tuesday
that is because drug traffickers have infiltrated the army and
national police.
   ``It's not for lack of military power that the big
narco-traffickers haven't been captured,'' Gomez said in an
interview with the radio chain Caracol. ``It's because they have
informants inside the police and army who warn them when there will
be operations to arrest them.''

in her cop-slapping trial Tueday, telling a jury she feared she
would be shot by a towering motorcycle officer who handcuffed her
while she was ``screaming like a pig.''
   In a trial dominated by her flamboyant behavior, another bizarre
development occurred Tuesday, the same day Miss Gabor ran from the
courtroom, hearing testimony she didn't like.
   On Tuesday afternoon, Officer Paul Kramer, the officer who
arrested her on June 14, was hospitalized in stable condition
Tuesday after his motorcyle collided with a police car.
   During an emergency call, Kramer's cycle collided with a police
car at the at Rodeo Drive intersection. He was admitted to UCLA
Medical Center in Westwood, where he was in stable condition with
head trauma, severe scrapes and bruises.
   Kramer had already testified, but might be needed for further
testimony. It was not immediately known what effect his injury might
have on Miss Gabor's trial.
   Earlier Tuesday, Miss Gabor collapsed in sobs after stomping out
of court during one policeman's testimony that immediately was
branded a lie by the star of such films as ``Picture Mommy Dead''
and ``Queen of Outer Space.''
   In afternoon testimony, the actress acknowledged scuffling with
Kramer, the 6-foot-4 motorcycle cop who pulled her over on a traffic
stop.
   ``I'm a Hungarian woman ... not a milquetoast.'' But she said she
came to fear the motorcycle officer more than she feared Nazis
during World War II.
   The Beverly Hills officer actually stopped her twice the day of
her June 14 arrest, the second time after she drove away as he
attempted to cite her. When he closed on her a second time, she
testified she feared he was going to shoot her.
   ``I was saying to myself `Uh oh, Zsa Zsa Gabor. Now you've had
it.'''
   She said she sat on a curb, handcuffed. ``I was screaming like a
pig,'' she said.
   Earlier in the day, Miss Gabor bolted from the courtroom when she
disagreed with testimony from another officer who assisted in the
arrest.
   ``I can't take this. It's a lie,'' Miss Gabor blurted as she left
the courtroom seven days into her misdemeanor trial.
   Defense attorney William Graysen immediately led his client back
into the courtroom and she broke down in sobs. Municipal Judge
Charles G. Rubin ordered a recess while the former Miss Hungary
regained her composure.
   The outburst came during testimony by police officer Scott
Thompson, who was called to assist the motorcycle officer Miss Gabor
admitted striking on June 14. Thompson said Miss Gabor cursed him.
   ``She looked at me and said, `You (expletive), I'm having your
job. I'm calling the Reagans on this,''' Thompson testified. Miss
Gabor, a longtime friend and neighbor of the former president, got
up and left at that point.
   Miss Gabor had been relatively calm during the trial, doodling on
a pad and sketching pencil portraits of the judge, clerk, bailiff
and even a respectable rendition of Officer Paul Kramer, the
policeman she struck.
   Her sharp-tongued, out-of-court commentaries to reporters were
finally muzzled by the judge after Deputy District Attorney Elden
Fox complained the actress was violating a gag order in the case.
   ``I have a gagging order,'' Miss Gabor said when questioned as
she left the courthouse Monday night.
   Miss Gabor is charged with battery on a police officer,
disobeying an officer's orders, driving with an expired license and
having an open container of alcohol _ a flask of Jack Daniels
whiskey in the glove compartment _ in her car.
   Kramer testified he was surprised Miss Gabor struck him, saying
the assault was unprovoked. Miss Gabor, a foot shorter and 100
pounds lighter than Kramer, said she struck in self-defense.
   Graysen is expected to contend that Kramer allegedly had a prior
history of being abusive with citizens pulled over for traffic stops.
   If convicted, Miss Gabor faces up to 18 months in jail. Graysen
said he will conclude his case with testimony from Miss Gabor. She
was expected to take the stand Friday or early next week.
   Unable to discuss the case directly, Miss Gabor said last week
she feared jail because they are filled with lesbians. ``I'm afraid
of lesbians,'' she blurted out.
   Before her courtroom collapse, Miss Gabor told reporters that a
homosexual group wrote to protest the remarks.
   ``I never said anything about lesbians. I got a letter from the
lesbians. They are outraged. I have so many friends who are. ... I
don't care who is what, I only like good people.''

   Dorothy Walker Bush, President Bush's
88-year-old mother, was in fair condition Tuesday at a hospital
where she was being treated for pneumonia, a spokeswoman said.
   Bush telephone his mother Tuesday, as did first lady Barbara
Bush, said hospital spokeswoman Michelle Brown.
   Mrs. Bush, who lives in Greenwich, was slightly improved over
Monday, when she was admitted to Greenwich Hospital, said Brown.
   ``She's feeling much better and she's walking,'' Brown said.
``She had not been feeling well last week. She had been suffering a
mild respiratory condition.''
   Mrs. Bush's condition began to worsen and her personal physician,
Dr. John Prunier, wanted her admitted, Brown said. A chest X-ray at
the hospital confirmed pneumonia, she said.
   She said Greenwich Hospital had agreed, in consultation with the
White House, not to issue more detailed information.
   Mrs. Bush spent four days in Greenwich Hospital in May for
treatment of a blood clot in her right leg. She had been admitted
with a 102-degree temperature. The president visited her here later
that month.

   Former President Jimmy Carter
has successfully negotiated with the leftist Sandinista government
for the return of a rebel Miskito Indian leader after years of exile.
   Under the deal, the Sandinistas dropped a ban on Brooklyn
Rivera's return to Nicaragua after Rivera agreed to renounce his
fight against the government, refrain from illegal activities and
cooperate in the process to hold general elections Feb 25.
   Carter said Rivera accepted the terms that he and Interior
Minister Tomas Borge agreed to Monday during a visit to this
northeastern seaport. Carter said Rivera would return to Nicaragua
shortly.
   Rivera left Nicaragua in 1981 to lead an Indian armed struggle
against the Sandinistas and has been living in neighboring Costa
Rica, and talks between the government and exiled Miskito leader,
head of the most populous tribe of Nicaraguan Indians, had dragged
for four years.
   Miskito, Sumo and Rama Indian groups, largely English-speaking
communities that live along Nicaragua's Caribbean coast, have been
fighting against the Sandinistas alongside the U.S.-supported Contra
rebels since 1980.
   These are basically the same conditions the Sandinistas set for
the return of non-Indian Contras. Under a previous Sandinista offer,
Rivera was to disarm his followers within 30 days of his return to
Nicaragua.
   Rivera said Tuesday that he expected other Indian leaders,
including Steadman Fagoth and Wycliff Diego, to return. The
agreement, however, was specifically for Rivera.
   Carter announced the agreement on the Rivera issue on his return
to Managua, shortly before heading back to Atlanta.
   The announcement was the highlight of the former president's
three-day trip to Nicaragua as head of a delegation that will
monitor elections in February.
   Carter expressed optimism that the elections would be fair.
   The 14-party National Opposition Union, the strongest challenger
to the Sandinista National Liberation Front, delivered a letter to
President Daniel Ortega accusing the government of failing to live
up to agreements reached last month.
   Carter pointed out that the last paragraph of the letter
reiterated the opposition's willingness to continue taking part in
the electoral process. ``Although there are problems, the agreements
reached ... give us optimism that the elections will be free and
fair,'' he said.
   He said his observer team plans to organize an independent
vote-count on elections night of the elections but will not release
its tallies until after the official returns are announced.
   The Nicaraguan government, the Supreme Electoral Council and the
political opposition invited Carter to observe the elections as
chairman of the Council of Freely Elected Heads of State, an
Atlanta-based organization.
   The United Nations and the Organization of American States also
will also sent observer teams.
   Carter also helped monitor the annulled Panamanian elections
earlier this year and has negotiated with Ethiopian officials and
Eritrean rebels to end their civil war.

<HEAD>Panel to Recommend 35 Percent Increase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special bipartisan House task force will
present to the leadership this week a call for a congressional pay
increase of about 35 percent over two years, a congressional said
Tuesday night.
   Other recommendations would end fees for making speeches and the
conversion of campaign funds to personal use.
   The source, who is in a position to know the recommendations and
who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned that the entire
package of rules changes planned by the task force could be changed
before it is proposed to the full House, which must be done by the
end of October.
   The heart of the package is the pay plan, which would include
about a 10 percent raise in 1990 and an additional 25 percent in
1991. After 1991, members would get cost-of-living pay increases.
   House and Senate members currently earn $89,500 per year, with
leaders earning more. The Senate would have to approve any pay
increases, which would apply to both bodies. A 35 percent increase
would make the salary $120,825.
   A key part of the plan would phase out honoraria _ fees for
making speeches, often to organizations lobbying for legislation _
over two years. Since House members now can keep honoraria totaling
30 percent of their pay, the 35 percent salary increase would mean
no member would lose money by the phase-out.
   The honoraria system has been much criticized by watchdog
organizations such as Common Cause. Critics say the fees, limited to
$2,000 per occasion, too often amount to a reward just for showing
up, sometimes at conventions at plush resorts for which the member's
expenses are picked up by the sponsors.
   The plan also would phase out the ``grandfather clause'' under
which members who were in Congress in January 1980 can convert
leftover campaign funds to personal use when they retire. The date
when the prohibition would take full effect has not been settled,
the source said.
   Other provisions of the package call for tightening requirements
to disclose gifts.
   The ethics panel was appointed by former Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, after lawmakers earlier this year fought a bitter, divisive
battle over a proposed 51 percent pay raise that was rejected after
a campaign led by consumer advocate Ralph Nader and others who
argued that it was excessive.
   The 51 percent proposal came from an advisory commission and was
recommended by President Reagan. It would have taken effect without
a vote unless rejected by Congress. Wright had devised a plan to
raise salaries by 30 percent in return for dropping honoraria, but
House members overwhelmingly voted to reject such a plan.
   Backers of a raise say members have not taken cost-of-living
increases in recent years and need a substantial increase to catch
up with inflation. Many members feel they must maintain two homes,
one in Washington and one in their districts, and face expenses that
others with similar salaries don't have, the supporters say.
   The task force of 10 members is equally divided between the
parties and chaired by Reps. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., and Lynn Martin,
R-Ill.

   The three airports serving New York City cannot
prevent people from giving out literature and asking for
contributions, a federal judge ruled.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe came in a
1975 suit brought by the International Society for Krishna
Consciousness Inc. against the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey.
   Lowe on Monday adopted a magistrate's recommendation that the
Port Authority regulation, which prohibited ``continuous and
repetitive'' solicitation, violated the First Amendment rights of
Krishna members, who give out literature about their religion and
ask for contributions.
   Arthur Berg, a Port Authority lawyer, said the ruling would not
be immediately noticeable at Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark airports
because an interim agreement with the Krishnas allowed two
representatives at each airport while the case was pending.
   He said the agreement would likely continue during the appeal.
``We do not believe airports are a public forum,'' Berg said.

   The American who sponsored Boris N. Yeltsin's
tour of America strongly denies accusations published by a Soviet
newspaper that the Communist Party maverick was publicly drunk for
much of the trip.
   ``If there was any problem with Yeltsin, it was jet lag,'' said
Jim Garrison, executive director of the Esalen Institute
Soviet-American Exchange Program, which sponsored the nine-day,
11-city tour. ``Most of the time he was cold sober.''
   Pravda, organ of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee, on
Monday reprinted an article from the Italian newspaper La Republica
saying Yeltsin was repeatedly drunk during the tour and squandered
his lecture fees shopping.
   Yeltsin ``leaves behind him a wake of catastrophic prophecies,
insane expenses, interviews, and above all the perfume of Jack
Daniels Black label,'' said the article, translated into Russian.

   As the 44th General Assembly opens,
diplomats and officials are looking forward to a new era of
international cooperation after last year's session saw ``an end to
the Cold War.''
   In the last two years, the 159 nations have built upon the thaw
between the superpowers, addressing in earnest issues such as
peacekeeping, pollution and the world economy in a new, cooperative
spirit.
   ``There's a feeling that fundamental changes are happening...and
that now is not the time...to play up national differences,'' said
Ronald I. Spiers, the undersecretary for General Assembly Affairs.
``People want to work together and seek solutions to problems rather
than score debating points.''
   President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
approved that approach in speeches to the General Assembly last year.

   Federal officials praised
Burroughs Wellcome Co.'s decision to reduce the wholesale price of
AZT by 20 percent, but some AIDS activists say the cut isn't deep
enough.
   ``This is a step in the right direction, but a very small step,''
says Peter Staley of the New York-based AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power. ``It's not enough.''
   Burroughs Wellcome Co. announced Monday that it will lower the
wholesale cost of the only federally approved AIDS treatment, citing
production efficiencies and research that suggests an increasing
demand for the drug.
   ``The expected growth in patient population, coupled with recent
production economies, will reduce somewhat our financial risk and
will remove some of the uncertainties which existed when this drug
was first introduced,'' said T.E. Haigler Jr., Burroughs' president

   Long-term studies with AZT show the AIDS drug can
reverse many symptoms of the disease in children while avoiding side
effects, researchers say.
   The drug previously has been shown to extend the lives of adults
with AIDS and to delay the development of symptoms in those who are
infected but not yet sick.
   A year ago, National Cancer Institute scientists reported it
could prevent brain abnormalities in children, but concerns about
its side effects remained.
   The most extensive study of AZT in children now shows it is safe,
helps children gain weight and avoid life-threatening infections,
and improves their well-being, says Ross McKinney of Duke University
in North Carolina.

   Pilots of United Airlines Flight 232 disagreed
over how best to control their crippled airliner seconds before it
crash-landed at an Iowa airport, according to a transcript of
cockpit conversation.
   The transcript shows Capt. Albert Haynes of United Flight 232
called for left turns, right turns and a cut in power within the
final 20 seconds before the DC-10 cartwheeled and exploded in flames
at Sioux City on July 19, killing 112 people.
   But trainer pilot Dennis Fitch told Haynes that closing the
throttles would take away the ability to steer the plane, according
to the transcript released Monday by the National Transportation
Safety Board. A report accompanying the transcript said Haynes
believes he added power ``just prior to contact with the ground.''
   Haynes, Fitch and two other pilots in the cockpit have been
widely praised for bringing the jetliner down with no greater loss
of life after one of its three engines exploded, severing all
hydraulic flight controls.

   Oil companies have obtained waivers from the
Federal Communications Commission to eliminate radio officers on
many tankers, a cost-cutting move that critics contend will increase

   The FCC requirement that all large ships carry at least one
trained radio officer originated in the 1930s, when ships needed
someone skilled in the pit-pat-pit of Morse code, says Exxon
Shipping Co. spokesman Leslie C. Rogers.
   ``Since that kind of radio telegraphy is obsolete, there's no
longer a need for a job category like this on these merchant
ships,'' Rogers said in a telephone interview Monday.
   But two unions _ the American Radio Officers Association and the

   A year ago, international arbitration ended
the last border dispute between Egypt and Israel, a squabble over a
250-acre strip of beach and the plush hotel on it.
   Israel lost.
   Now, six months after the Israelis ceded Taba to Egypt, the
former Aviya-Sonesta Beach Hotel is struggling to develop an
Egyptian image while catering to its main clientele, Israelis.
   ``It's still the same hotel,'' said Joe Sultan, the general
manager through successive owners and management chains. But, he
said, ``instead of a waiter called Moshe, we now have Moussa.''
   Opened in 1982 by its builder, the Egyptian-born Israeli Eli
Papouchado, the 10-story, 327-room luxury hotel has panoramic views
of the Gulf of Aqaba and the Sinai Peninsula's rugged mountains. It
quickly became a favorite among Israelis whose army seized the Sinai
in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967.
   Although Taba had been in dispute since early 1982 when Israel
refused to return it with the rest of Sinai under terms of a 1979
peace agreement, Israelis nonetheless were shocked on Sept. 29,
1988, to find the place no longer belonged to them. After
deliberating 18 months, international arbitrators ruled that
Egyptian claims prevailed and ordered Israel to end its occupation.
   Months of haggling followed over special facilities for Israeli
tourists and compensation to owner Papouchado _ the settlement was
$37 million _ but Egypt finally raised its flag over Taba on March
15.
   Egyptian nationals marched into the hotel, Taba's only
significant structure, to claim jobs.
   Outside, Israeli employees burned street barricades of automobile
tires and demonstrated to protest their uncertain future. About 280
of the 306 Israeli workers last March have been laid off to comply
with Egyptian law that limits foreign employment to 10 percent of
the work force.
   But manager Sultan said in a telephone interview the hotel staff
has become a model of co-existence.
   ``This is beautiful,'' he said. ``I wish the governments would
take an example from the harmony.''
   Many details remained unsettled and confusion reigned at the
turnover in March, but much of that has dissipated as technical
problems have been ironed out.
   Israelis stayed away in the first weeks after the turnover, and
the hotel's occupancy rate fell from better than 90 percent to
around 40 percent. Sultan said that by August it had recovered much
of the lost ground.
   Hotel shopowners, mostly Israelis, feared working under Egypt's
more stringent import controls, but they've settled into their new
state of affairs.
   Prices on menus are being changed gradually to Egyptian pounds
from Israeli shekels and U.S. dollars.
   Taba, at the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba, 230 miles east of
Cairo, was a wasteland at the end of a desert wadi when Israel
captured the Sinai in the 1967 war.
   Thus, Egypt has no infrastructure there to support the hotel and
must buy water, electricity and some goods from Israel. Taba's
telephone lines are linked through Israel.
   And because there is no housing at Taba other than the hotel,
Egyptian employees must travel 90 miles a day to and from Nuweiba to
go to work.
   The 28 Israeli employees commute from Eilat, the Israeli port
which is close by. They work in positions where Hebrew is necessary
to communicate with patrons.
   The Egyptian personnel manager, Aly Abdel-Aziz, said Israeli
singers and two belly dancers still perform but with fewer Hebrew
songs.
   Although their flag flies over Taba now, Egyptians haven't
flocked to the resort.
   One reason may be room rates of $150 a night. Few Egyptians can
afford even the reduced rate of $54, which is high for a country
with an average monthly take-home pay of $40.
   But Fuad Sultan, Egypt's tourism minister, said plans are under
way to promote Taba worldwide as a warm-weather resort and to equip
a nearby landing strip for large airplanes.
   ``Until Taba was returned to Egypt, it was only a satellite of
Eilat,'' he said.
   ``Now it's our goal to create something that says, `This is
really Egypt.'''

   Environmentalists are concerned
that a quest for gold, uranium and other minerals threatens severe
damage to Venezuela's Amazon and the way of life of the territory's
12 Indian tribes.
   The territory of about 70,000 square miles of jungle and granite
is an an extension of Brazil's Amazon, already exploited and damaged
by the clearing of rain forests for development and by wildcat
mining.
   The mighty Orinoco River forms in Venezuela's Federal Amazonas
Territory and makes its way eastward to the Caribbean Sea.
   But the territory also contains precious minerals in its soil and
riverbeds, mainly gold and uranium, and the quest for them and the
riches they bring threatens a fragile ecosystem and the last of the
forest Indians whose way of life goes back millenia.
   Most of the territory is unexplored, and studies of its mineral
riches are mere estimates.
   Venezuela declared the Amazonas region a federal reserve in 1972,
off limits to all economic development projects.
   But, in apparent contradiction of the laws, the Ministry of Mines
in Caracas, the nation's capital, has granted concessions to some
miners operating inside the territory's three national parks and
other concessions to gold buyers.
   At the same time, the Ministry of the Environment has been
accused of catering to ``developmentalists,'' those who would like
to see Venezuela reap economic benefits from its land.
   Environmentalists complained in January when the government of
then-President Jaime Lusinchi gave the Guayana Venezuela Corp. the
rights to begin development projects in mining and other industries
in previously virgin Amazonas.
   The corporation, known by its Spanish initials CVG, is a state
entity that has monopolized iron, aluminum and gold exploitation in
nearby Bolivar state in southeastern Venezuela.
   The Lusinchi government's decree gives CVG power to move Indians
from their villages when deemed necessary and it has even asked
Indian leaders to work with it in cataloguing the region's potential
riches.
   The CVG plans to create extensive mining zones and rubber tapping
plantations, claims Aida Santana, head of Caracas Central
University's ``Amazonas Project.''
   Under the project students travel by river canoe into remote
Indian villages to spend months as part of their training in
medicine, anthropology, biology and other specialties.
   Santana maintains that the CVG's development plans would create
in Amazonas another ``Kilometer 88,'' an infamous strip of
malaria-and vice-ridden gold mines in Bolivar state.
   CVG denies that it plans unbalanced development of the region,
saying it will incorporate environmental impact reports into its
plans.
   However, Santana said: ``Any plans for exploitation of the
Amazonas are not justified. The resources are non-renewable, and
their exploitation is not worth the human sacrifice, and the
extinction of fauna and flora we have not even begun to study.''
   But the concerns of environmentalists may have become known too
late.
   Signs in Puerto Ayacucho, the capital of the territory with a
population of 40,000 along the Orinoco River, already advertise to
buy gold.
   Indians have moved to Puerto Ayacucho from their forest homes and
roam the streets at night after frequenting drinking establishments.
   Much of the mining in the territory's national parks, especially
in Yapacana Park at the confluence of the Orinoco and Ventuari
rivers, is done by Indians, generally of the Piaroa and Guajibo
ethnic groups, said Rafael Garcia of the National Parks Institute.
   ``The Indians usually use rudimentary mining techniques, such as
picks and shovels and sieves,'' he said. ``But the `creoles'
(Venezuelans of mixed blood) who travel down to barter gold usually
rip them off.''
   Garcia added that in addition to exploiting the Indian miners,
outsiders were using mercury to extract gold from riverbeds,
poisoning the water and causing extensive damage to wildlife and the
Indians themselves.
   Roman Catholic missionaries in the southeast of the territory,
home to roughly 9,000 Yanomami Indians who also inhabit areas of
Brazil, recently blamed gold miners for the deaths by mercury
poisoning of some 100 Yanomami children.
   An invasion of about 3,000 Brazilian gold wildcatters into the
Venezuelan Amazon at the headwaters of the Orinoco created a public
outcry in April.
   The Brazilians were eventually airlifted by Venezuelan and
Brazilian military craft back to Brazil, but not before they caused
extensive damage to the headwaters.
   The Brazilians dredged riverbeds and cut down all vegetation
within 600 feet of the river. Scientists estimated the damage would
take hundreds of years to repair.
   The public outrage, not only over the environmental damage but
the assault on national ``sovereignty,'' led for calls for the
creation of a national park along the Sierra de Parima and the
headwaters of the Orinoco, and the use of national guard troops and
student volunteers to man the park system in Amazonas.

   The moment the elevator door opened, Clareise
Jones sensed the danger. She sidestepped a mound of garbage and
shone a light into the basement corners. ``We don't want to stay
here too long,'' she said.
   She tiptoed in, and immediately found evidence: fresh rat
droppings. Over there, she said, spotlighting two holes in the
floor. ``Rat burrows.''
   And there, a dead rat.
   ``Nasty,'' Jones said. ``Very nasty.''
   Jones, poking into dank places in the largely toney Upper East
Side this day, is one of New York City's 22 rat inspectors.
   Rats live in every area of the city, surviving off abandoned food
from the slums and in the sewers to the swanky suites and Strawberry
Fields of Central Park.
   No one has taken a census, but a conservative count puts the rat
population at one for each of the city's 8 million human residents.
Some experts say it may be as high as four or five rats per person.
   The numbers indicate New York is a rat paradise, and those whose
job is to rid the city of the nocturnal rodents agree.
   That doesn't mean the rat killers haven't made progress. Three
hundred rat bites are recorded annually now, but that's down from
about 750 a year two decades ago.
   The rat control program has won praise from experts, and
officials from cities in Europe, Asia and elsewhere in the United
States have come here for training.
   ``The New York City program, for all of the problems that come
with large cities, has one of the finest targeted urban rat control
programs in the nation,'' said Jerry Hershovitz, a public-health
administrator for the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, who
worked with city rat control programs before federal funds for them
were cut several years ago.
   Solomon Peeples, New York's pest control director, calls himself
a ``professional killer, a hit man.''
   ``I kill rats,'' he said in his deep baritone. ``The four-legged
kind.''
   Peeples oversees about 1,000 full- and part-time workers and a
budget of $10 million a year. The youthful 65-year-old has held
nearly every position in the division.
   His crusade started about 25 years ago when as a health inspector
he went on a call to a rundown Brooklyn apartment.
   ``This small, innocent child had been bitten by a rat on his
wrist,'' he said. ``Something all of a sudden hit me. I decided I
was going to do something about this.''
   He transferred to the pest control division, which had just
formed, and over the years his expertise grew until he knew a lot
about rats _ and about people.
   ``I hate to concede the fact that rats are smart. It really
bothers me,'' he said in a recent interview. ``The other part of
this problem is that people are dumb.''
   Some people unknowingly do their best to fatten rats, he said in
his sparsely furnished office, a poster of well-fed rats behind him.
   ``From seven o'clock to 11 o'clock at night, it's a rat's holiday
in New York,'' he said. ``That's the major TV time, and people all
over this city rush home, make dinner, and go to the living room to
watch TV.
   ``In the meantime, rats are in the kitchen, having their
dinner,'' Peeples said. ``If you have steak for dinner, the rat has
steak for dinner. And if you leave your food out overnight, well,
you are just inviting the rat for breakfast.''
   Peeples marvels at the abilities of his nemesis.
   Rats can walk up the sides of buildings.
   Rats can swim ``better than Mark Spitz in his prime.''
   Rats can gnaw through concrete.
   They also gnaw at electrical wires, setting off fires. Rats ruin
fabrics, contaminate food and transmit a variety of diseases through
bites and through fleas they carry.
   The rodents _ New York has mostly Norway rats and black rats _
generally live about a year, producing up to seven litters that
average eight to 12 young each.
   Rats are savvy in sniffing out poisons. They often travel in
packs, and when one finds a trap, it will urinate on the bait and
sound warnings.
   Others develop immunities. This apparently happened in the
mid-1970s in the Bronx. The surviving breed was called ``Super Rat.''
   Peeples switched poisons, and Super Rat fell.
   His division focuses on prevention by educating people to put
food away and patch holes in walls. But it also reacts to rat
complaints by sending out inspectors, extermination teams and
cleanup crews. Negligent landlords are billed for cleanup costs.
   Clareise Jones sent the landlord a summons following her tour of
the Upper East Side basement, where a sign read: ``If you don't want
MICE, please put garbage in cans.'' Garbage sprawled underneath.
   Jones, who has never been bitten by a rat, stayed only a few
minutes, long enough to see the dead rat.
   Fleas and mites can jump off dead rats onto any warm body nearby,
she said.
   ``Let's get out of here.''

<HEAD>ABC's New Pony Express Show Fails to Deliver</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gather round the electronic campfire, buckaroos,
and ABC will show you a preview tonight of its new Old West series
about the gallant lads of the Pony Express, ``The Young Riders.''
   On second thought, read a good western instead, maybe something
like ``He Rode Tall in the Saddle Until His Blisters Broke.''
   For tonight's ``The Young Riders'' _ the series starts its
regular Thursday night run tomorrow _ is so mundane and
cliche-ridden that teen-agers who see it may say, ``So this is how
the West was wan.''
   Occasionally exhibiting beautiful sunrises and sunsets, it
purports to tell how the Pony Express dashed the mail by horseback
from St. Joseph, Mo., to Sacramento, Calif.
   This was back in the halcyon days before fax machines ruined
everything.
   Our young riders _ only orphans need apply as riders _ risk
hostile Indians, brigands, the elements and Nielsen families to get
the mail through. They are five in number, and the show centers on
``The Kid,'' a decent, rugged sort essayed by Ty Miller.
   The others are a varied lot. One swaggers, is tough and eager to
use his pistol. Another is a halfbreed; he wears an earring. Another
can hear but can't speak due to a childhood disease that left him
bald.
   For history buffs, there's even a William Cody, who in later
years would make a living in touring Wild West shows.
   Here, he is so cocky that Teaspoon, the grizzled old plainsman
who is teaching survival skills to the new riders, is moved to ask,
``You think you're pretty hot stuff, don't you?'' ``Yup,'' young
Cody says.
   Teapoon fixes him with a steady gaze. ``Cowpies,'' he sneers.
   Well, even though the fine actor Anthony Zerbe plays Teaspoon,
this retort indicates a minor flaw in the show, such as an awful
script. An awful script sometimes means there will be more of the
same, which does not bode well for the future of this series.
   True, there is a tiny surprise in tonight's premiere. Lou, the
fifth young rider, proves in one regard to be in violation of Pony
Express rules, which prompts The Kid to warn: ``You won't fool
people forever.''
   True, the plot traditions of the Old West are attempted here. The
regulars include the handsome town marshal (Brett Cullen) who is
sweet on a lovely lady (Melissa Leo) who is sort of the young
riders' den mother.
   And tonight's show does have two Old West staples, a band of
heartless villains, led by a man with rotten teeth and a scar on his
face, and a rousing chase scene involving hostile Indians.
   But there is no way any of this can work in a show that not only
has hostile Indians foiled by firecrackers, but also a grizzled,
hard-bitten plainsman who says ``Cowpies.''

   On Friday, ABC will preview ``Free Spirit,'' a Sunday sitcom
about a harried, freshly divorced dad (Franc Luz) coping with three
kids, his law practice and a bubbly young witch (Corinne Bohrer) who
becomes the kids' new housekeeper and best friend.
   Only the kids know she's a witch, of course. In case you're
wondering, yes, Old Dad will become attracted to her, and vice versa.
   I don't know if ``Spirit'' should be called ``Bewitched: The
Sequel.'' But, like ``The Young Riders,'' the opening show, dealing
with bowling and character introductions, has a script that gives
lame a bad name.
   You get the feeling this newcomer is in trouble when, at the
start of the show, Luz' teen-age daughter complains to Old Dad that
her teen-age brother told one of her classmates ``that I used to be
a Siamese twin.''
   The laugh track chuckles, but I fear America won't.

   Elsewhere in Television: NBC whooped it up Tuesday, having set a
TV record, it says, in which it became the first network to win the
prime-time ratings race for 52 consecutive weeks. The previous champ
was CBS, which did it for 46 weeks in the season of 1962-63.
   ``It's another milestone for us,'' said NBC spokeswoman Curt
Block, whose network has won the prime-time ratings derby for five
consecutive seasons and is expected to do it again this season.
   In setting its record for the 52-week period that ended Sunday,
he said, NBC averaged a 14.3 rating for 52 weeks, ABC an 11.6 and
CBS an 11.5. Each ratings point now represents 921,000 homes.

   Indications from around the country show many
homeowners still anxious to exchange variable rate mortgages for
fixed-rate loans, even if the numbers might not add up.
   For many people, they really don't.
   Is it worthwhile for you to dump your existing mortgage in order
to save two percentage points? Even if the lower rate cuts your
monthly payments by enough to allow you to put money in the bank or
go out once or twice a month?
   Maybe not, even if your friends, financial counselor, neighbors
and spouse say go ahead. If you do, be sure you know the cost, the
length of time you'll be keeping the mortgage, and a lot about your
local market.
   1. To refinance usually means a fee of 1 percent or 2 percent of
the total mortgage, and sometimes as much 3 percent. These are
points, but seldom are they the only charge.
   The additional charges might include origination, application,
appraisal, legal and other fees. In some instances they can add
another 1.5 percent of the mortgage amount. If so, your upfront
total is then 3.5 points.
   The cost of these fees should make you think again, especially if
you are remortgaging to lower your interest charges by just one or
two percentage points. The charges might be heftier than the savings.
   Sears Mortgage Corp. offers this formula to clarify your thinking:
   _Add the points being charged by the lender to the total amount
of fees, expressed in points. Two points plus another 1.5 points for
fees is your total upfront cost.
   _Determine the difference between the interest rate you are now
paying and the rate being offered. If you are paying 11.5 percent
currently and have the opportunity for a new rate of 9.5 percent
(unlikely), your answer is 2.
   _Divide that 2, or whatever number applies, into the total points.
   The answer will be the number of years required for you to break
even _ that is, to pay off the points. Thereafter, you are ahead of
the game. But up to that point you are behind.
   If you were saving just one percentage point of interest, and
your total points was 3.5, it would take you 3.5 years to break
even. If you were paying 4.5 points, it would take you about 4.5
years to break even.
   2. These factors have special meanings, depending on the owner's
age and likelihood of remaining in the house. Relatively few people
pay off mortgages. At times, the average mortgage has had a life
span of just seven years.
   3. All this should be considered in relation to what's happening
in your local market, not just on what you hear about national
averages. Prices vary from one neighborhood to another, interest
rates from one city to another.
   Never forget that real estate markets are cyclical. More so than
almost any other segment of the economy, they have ups and downs.
   If your area is down and likely to fall further, then interest
rates might also fall, even if only by a fraction of a point. More
importantly, your lender might become friendlier, perhaps even
knocking off one full point.
   Try to get a feel for what might happen nationally too. If you
think rates will fall, you might consider delaying your refinancing.
The opposite, of course, also applies: Act quickly if you're not
likely to get better terms.
   These factors are extremely important in determing whether to
stay with a variable rate mortgage or transfer to a fixed. If rates
rise, your fixed loan doesn't. If rates fall, you remain at the
higher rate. And vice versa.
   Finally, the best deal might be with your current lender. Lenders
don't like to lose good customers. Conceivably, they might make you
an offer you cannot refuse.

   Even in a city where titanic deals are fairly
ordinary, the one the William Morris talent agency cut for itself on
``The Cosby Show'' was a whopper.
   For simply introducing Bill Cosby to the show's producers,
William Morris negotiated a contract bringing the agency 10 percent
of every dollar ``The Cosby Show'' generates, a windfall in excess
of $100 million since 1984.
   The pact dramatizes the power that agencies like William Morris,
the Creative Artists Agency and International Creative Management
now wield in Hollywood, especially through packaging TV shows.
   With packaging, a longtime practice in the movie industry, agents
deliver the key ingredients for a hit movie or TV series. However,
packaging also sometimes provides agents with extravagant payments _
usually a percentage of a show's revenues _ for little more than
introducing one agency client to a producer.
   For some, the practice smacks of artistic extortion, and those
involved in making deals are reluctant to talk about it.
   ``It's Al Capone saying, `Fellas, you wanna open a bar in South
Chicago? This is the deal: My beer. My laundry. My glasses. My
bartender. My union. My trucks,''' said a top TV writer-producer who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   What bothers the production community is that package fees come
from the production itself, taking away funds that could help make a
better project. And for some producers, paying a package commission
can mean the difference between profit and loss.
   ``I think (packaging) is absolutely the worst waste of money that
you could possibly imagine,'' said writer-producer Danny Arnold, one
of the few who would allow his name to be used. ``I think it's an
extortion ... and one of the worst abuses in this business.''
Arnold, whose credits include the old TV series ``Barney Miller,''
``Bewitched'' and ``That Girl,'' recently signed a deal with Disney
Co. to create TV and movie products.
   At one time, and occasionally today, television packaging
represented a real service. A packaged show _ a Perry Como or Danny
Thomas special, ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' _ might have included a
writer, a director, a star, other related talent and perhaps even
advertisers, bookkeepers and lawyers.
   The movie business still represents an area in which packagers
serve an essential role. For no extra fee _ no package commission _
agents bring together several clients to form an outstanding team.
Such was the case with Oliver Stone and the cast of ``Platoon,'' and
the recent ``Mississippi Burning'' and ``Rain Man.''
   Network executives say privately that as much as they despise
television packaging, they are reluctant to do anything about it
because if one network stops the practice, another network will
accept the deals.
   CBS, however, was so concerned about packaging fees that it held
discussions during last year's writers strike to see whether the
strike could be settled if packaging fees were abolished. The talks
failed to result in any action.
   Several top producers maintain that the three top agencies _
William Morris, CAA and ICM _ sometimes are interested more in
negotiating big packaging commissions for themselves than in
promoting their clients' careers or making good shows.
   ``There are a lot of deals that don't get made that should have
because somebody objects to a package commission,'' said one top TV
executive.
   At least one TV executive has asked California legislators to
address the package issue. But the Department of Industrial
Relations, which regulates agents' fee schedules, does not determine
package fee limits, said spokesman Richard Stevens.
   The top agencies are privately held and declined to be
interviewed. CAA operates with almost comical secrecy. Ray Kurtzman,
head of CAA's business affairs department, would not even decline to
be interviewed unless he could do so off the record.
   Thus, it is hard to pinpoint every packaged show. However,
published reports suggest that ``The Cosby Show,'' ``Roseanne,''
``Golden Girls,'' ``Empty Nest,'' ``Beauty and the Beast'' and ``The
Famous Teddy Z'' are just a few of the packaged shows now on the air.
   The packaged talent in most situation comedies is the
writer-producer. But almost anybody can be packaged in a miniseries
or movie. The payoffs can be tremendous. CAA, more than any other
agency in town, is rolling in money.
   To appreciate CAA's embarrassment of riches, consider the case of
the CAA ficus tree: I.M. Pei, the famed architect who designed the
agency's elaborate new office, selected CAA's huge tree from a
Florida grove and then shipped it to Mexico for a year's
acclimatization.
   The privately held agency, representing more than 600 top clients
like Paul Newman, Bill Murray, Jane Fonda and Madonna, grossed $65
million last year, and CAA president Michael Ovitz himself made $10
million, according to the entertainment industry newsletter Show Biz
News.
   By controlling so many leading actors, writers and directors, the
superagents can cut deals pretty much on their own terms. Producers
not willing to play along often find doors locked.
   Television and movie executives are convinced that anyone
speaking publicly against the superagents will suffer greatly,
perhaps kept from signing an agency's top talent.
   Those few agents who do grant interviews defend packaging, saying
it provides a real service, often helping to create a hit show.
   ``It doesn't need justification, because it works,'' said Arnold
Rifkin, a founder of Triad Artists. ``When a network buys a show
that's successful, they increase their revenues. ... And you've
created that potential for them.''
   Chet Migden, executive director of the Association of Talent
Agents, said package deals generate more work for actors, directors
and writers. ``In order to get work for clients, agents began to
think creatively about putting properties together.''
   Without package fees, agents take a percentage commission _
usually 10 percent _ on their clients' paychecks, and no more. With
packaging fees, agents charge from 6 percent to 10 percent on the
total cost of each and every episode in a TV series.
   With a normal commission, for example, a writer paid $50,000 a
week by a situation comedy would give his agent $5,000 a week. The
packaged clients keep 100 percent of their checks. With a package
deal on that sitcom costing $700,000 a week, the agent collects up
to $70,000 weekly, plus up to 10 percent of everything the series
makes in the fruitful syndication market.
   Producers are trapped by the package commission because networks
will not buy shows unless they have the top talent usually covered
by packages. If one producer refuses to pay a package fee, there is
always another who will.
   ``The agencies aren't fools,'' said one television producer.
``They know if we need these things to make the programs we produce
more noticeable ... they can extract a premium for that.
   ``The networks continue to ask only for the `A' players. ... And
the `A' players are controlled by fewer and fewer agencies.''

   Donna White has a $500 fingernail on her
pinkie. It's 14 karat gold, 2 inches long and adorned with nine
dangling charms.
   In a society so sated that its garbage provides meals for the
homeless, ``nail art'' has become a multimillion-dollar business.
Booths and salons are springing up as fast as the human nail can
grow.
   ``When I was growing up in New Orleans, the only women who
painted their nails red worked in brothels,'' says manicurist Karen
Garlow. Now, women seeking a genteel look can have cameos painted on
their nails; the more showy can have diamonds or pearls drilled in.
For just plain funky, there's no limit.
   One woman wanted bowling balls painted on her nails for the night
of her local tournament. And after the Washington Redskins won the
Super Bowl in 1987, dozens of fans had the phone number of
quarterback Doug Williams painted onto all 10 nails _ toes too, in
some cases.
   When Dorothy's fiance asked her what stone she wanted for her
engagement, she requested a three-carat diamond _ drilled into her
nail. ``It'll still be on my finger,'' she says, asking that her
last name be withheld.
   ``Now that women have become accepted in the work force and
realize they don't have to look like men, they use nail polish and
art as accessories for their wardrobe. It makes them look
well-groomed, dressed up,'' says Garlow.
   And not just women. Garlow recently painted art work on the nails
of 20 3-year-olds as entertainment at a birthday party. ``You know,
instead of playing pin the donkey.''
   Ms. White, also a manicurist, is adept at using an air brush and
other art tools to create fancy nails despite her own 2-inch talons.
   The ``canvas'' for most of the art is an acryllic substance
shaped into the form of nails to make the human nail longer and
harder. A set of artificial nails costs anywhere from $40 to $75,
and ``upkeep'' runs about $25 every two or three weeks. That's for
just regular polishing and filing.
   Nail art runs the gamut of prices _ as little as $2 a nail for
simple sparkles or foil paper, and as high as $2,000 for precious
stones.
   Snails, a Florida-based nail art supply business, estimates its
gross sales this year at about $1 million, says owner Marlene
Sortino.
   She recently moved her offices to the East Coast from Los
Angeles, where nail art first gained fashion in the United States,
expecting a business slump. Instead, her sales have tripled, she
says.
   Ms. Sortino also exports her products to Australia, Saudi Arabia
and other far-flung spots.
   As in the case of many trends, California is frequently cited as
the birthplace of nail art, but the ornate decoration actually is
centuries-old. In China, long nails were a mark of distinction
setting the nobles apart from the working class.
   Robin Weir, a top society hairdresser in Washington, has a
collection of custom-designed protectors used by Chinese women to
guard their jewel-encrusted nails, which were sometimes grown to as
much as one foot.
   Weir, who used to do first lady Nancy Reagan's hair and nails,
has judged a number of nail art competitions around the United
States.
   Mrs. Reagan had nails so thin when she first came to the White
House, ``you could read a newspaper through them,'' Weir says. But
she refused artificial nails, opting for a nature-based
nail-hardening treatment and subdued polish.
   The art competitions, held on local and national levels, are a
chance to win thousands of dollars in prizes provided by cosmetics
manufacturers to promote their products, says Jacquelyn G. Randolph,
chairwoman of the Washington Cosmetology Association Nail Fashion
Committee.
   She estimates nail industry sales around the country, including
nail art, at $1.5 billion or more.
   Ms. Randolph, who holds a degree in business administration and
accounting from Georgetown University, opened her nail salon four

discovery being hologram paper pasted onto nails in iridescent
geometric patterns.
   Now, she's turning her attention to male nails.
   She already has noticed that many high school boys in Washington
paint art on their pinkies. Whether that will catch on with older
men remains to be seen.
   But, she says, ``you don't have to sacrifice your manhood to get
artificial nails. A manicure doesn't mean you're a sissy.''

   They worked together in the civil rights movement and share a
faith that recognizes no racial boundaries, but Christ's flock in
the United States remains largely divided into black and white sheep.
   Gains in integration in business, government and education have
not been matched in the church, which some observers say may be the
nation's most segregated institution.
   Why?
   ``Isn't it obvious? It's racism. That's what brought about the
black church since its inception _ slavery _ and it hasn't
changed,'' said the Rev. Amos Jones Jr., director of Christian
education for the National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc.
   More than seven in 10 black Americans say they are Methodists or
Baptists, according to a 1988 Gallup Poll. Yet, in the nation's
largest Protestant denomination, the 14.8 million-member Southern
Baptist Convention, only an estimated 3 percent are black. In the 9
million-member United Methodist Church, an estimated 4 percent of
members are black.
   In the Roman Catholic Church, a black priest has started his own
church in Washington, D.C., and the nation's black bishops have
condemned racism within the U.S. church, although the 53
million-member body has more black members _ an estimated 2 million
_ than any other predominantly white Christian group.
   The segregation is even greater in the black churches.
   ``A fraction of a fraction of 1 percent'' is the estimated number
of whites in the National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc., according
to Jones. Officials in the 3 million-member African Methodist
Episcopal Church estimate one-tenth of 1 percent of its members are
white.
   ``Sunday morning is the most segregated time in the country,''
said the Rev. Charles White, a white Presbyterian pastor who is
co-chairman of the North American Interfaith Network.
   White said there is a profound difference between the teachings
of Christianity and the way it adapts to the society around it.
   ``Religion more often than not serves to bolster our own
identities. If we are at heart racist, and I believe at heart both
blacks and whites are racist, then we ought not to be surprised that
religion bolsters that,'' he said.
   The attempt by the Rev. George A. Stallings to form an
unauthorized parish for black Catholics in Washington is full of
historical precedent. Introduced to Christianity through slavery,
black Americans have for centuries moved away from predominantly
white churches into churches they had more control over and felt
comfortable in.
   Once criticized for serving as a barrier to blacks in their
efforts to make gains in American society, the black church has
enjoyed a resurgence since the late 1960s, when blacks and other
ethnic groups began to question the value of assimilation and place
greater reliance on institutions that preserved their heritage.
   ``In predominantly white groups, people of black heritage often
feel like they're the invisible man. They're there, but not ever
seen,'' said Bishop Cecil Bishop, president of the Board of Bishops
of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church.
   Despite the solidarity many within predominantly white churches
showed in the civil rights movement of a generation ago, the racism
that caused the black church remains today, if in more subtle forms,
according to black church leaders.
   Jones said black churches address the needs of black Americans,
while many predominantly white churches embrace the status quo.
   For example, he said, ``Southern Baptists are hard-pressed to say
anything against apartheid, hunger in Mississippi, racism among
elected officials.''
   Some officials in predominantly white churches contend black
churches make exaggerated claims of racism because they are fearful
of losing members to churches actively seeking to integrate their
pews.
   The Southern Baptist Convention is on record as condemning
apartheid, hunger and racism, said the Rev. Sid Smith of that
denomination's Black Church Development Board.
   ``I do not mean to imply we have arrived, for we have not,''
Smith said. ``But we are not the old-school racist denomination of a
generation ago.''
   The black church also is not without its own debates on
prejudice. In the African Methodist Episcopal Church, for example,
there is only one native bishop in the church's six episcopal
districts in Africa. Last year, the church elected three bishops to
serve West Africa, Central Africa and South Africa _ all were from
the United States.
   Robert H. Reid, editor of the A.M.E. Christian Recorder, said
church officials used to say African blacks were not qualified to be
bishops. ``That is no longer true, and that would have been no
longer true for decades,'' he said.
   Still, Jones said, unlike some white churches, the doors of the
black church have always been open.
   ``We've never had a closed-door policy as white Southern
Baptists, southern Methodists, Presbyterians have had. We've been
the ones rejected and turned away,'' Jones said.
   But officials at the nation's largest churches say there has been
some movement toward integration.
   In the Southern Baptist Convention, which split from northern
Baptists in the 1840s because of its defense of slavery, six state
conventions have elected black presidents, and among Protestant
churches, ``we put more money into the black community than any
other denomination today, period,'' Smith said.
   Barbara Ricks Thompson, the general secretary of the Commission
on Religion and Race of the United Methodist Church, said her
denomination is giving blacks greater leadership roles. For example,
while approximately 4 percent of the church members are black, 10 of
the church's 49 active bishops are black.
   As the estimated number of black Catholics has more than doubled
from 900,000 to 2 million in 20 years, the church has established a
national Office for Black Catholics.
   Deacon Ronald Walker, a black clergyman from Buffalo, N.Y.,
recalled his Baptist grandfather telling him, ``Catholicism is the
church that's going to take a mule to heaven.''
   But he stayed within the church, and eventually sought his
vocation there.
   ``I was searching for something all my life. I love the church.
The roots of the church go back to my grandmother and mother,''
Walker said.
   When he was deciding whether to become a deacon, what impressed
him was that ``there was an openness, a reception, and my status as
being black didn't matter.''

   In Scandinavia, people drink to get drunk, not
too often but with gusto. As one authority says, it's part of the
``northern culture.'' The governments of Sweden, Norway and Finland
try to control the consumption of alcohol by making it expensive,
and in the process are making a lot of money.

   The crowds begin to gather at noon on
Friday. By 3 p.m. customers are spilling into the street.
   By closing time at 6 p.m. the waiting lines run into the hundreds
as people try to buy their weekend ration of wine, beer or hard
liquor at the state-run store.
   It's not a matter of shortage, but of government attempts to make
drinking difficult _ and to make a lot of money in the process.
   ``Swedes have a hedonistic way of drinking,'' says Hans Klette, a
law professor at Lund University. ``It's part of the northern
culture.''
   Bjorn Hibell, director of the Swedish Council for Information on
Alcohol and Other Drugs, says: ``We drink in the Scandinavian way _
not too often, but a lot. We drink more to get intoxicated than in
other countries.''
   Though Scandinavian governments try to control the consumption of
alcohol, at the same time they profit from it through taxes that
boost the price to the consumer to 10 times the cost.
   In Sweden, Finland and Norway, alcohol is sold legally only in
state stores at government-set prices. Only the Soviet Union has a
similar system in Europe.
   Prices are meant to be prohibitive.
   Finland raised liquor prices twice last year to discourage heavy
drinkers, pushing up the cost of a bottle of scotch to $36.40. Sales
dipped briefly, but quickly returned to normal.
   Sweden's parliament is considering legislation to reduce the
level of alcohol tolerated for drivers to virtually nil. The legal
limit in Scandinavia already is lower than in most of Europe, at
0.05 percent alcohol in the blood.
   Courts in the three countries link fines for drunken driving to
an offender's income. A Norwegian lawyer set the record this year
after failing a breath test in a spot road check: He was fined
$16,000.
   Compared with other countries, alcohol consumption per person is
low. Finland rates 26th in the world, Sweden is 31st and Norway is
33rd.
   But Scandinavians rarely have a casual glass of wine with dinner,
a cold beer to quench a hot thirst or a pre-dinner aperitif.
   ``A small percentage of the people, maybe 10 percent, drink about
half the alcohol sold,'' Hibell says.
   Drinking is ingrained in national customs, from the protocol of a
formal evening party to the celebrations of Crayfish Day, which
falls on Aug. 10.
   On that day, Swedes wear party hats, tie red napkins below their
chins, sing boisterous drinking songs and plunder a bowl of the
small lobster-like shellfish. Custom dictates that each claw is
washed down with a glass of schnapps. About 20 crayfish make a meal.
   The culture of alcohol may have its origins in the chilly climate
and the long, dreary winters. The vikings were said to have an
affinity for mead and other strong drink. Some social observers say
the normally shy Scandinavians need alcohol to open up.
   As early as the 18th century, Sweden's King Gustav III saw liquor
as a main source of income, and urged drinking as an act of
patriotism. In the 19th century, Swedish companies often paid their
workers in booze.
   Excessive drinking led to a powerful temperance movement, now 150
years old. Sweden imposed rationing in 1917, limiting men to three
liters of spirits a month, and less for women. Ration books lasted
until 1955.
   Prohibition was introduced in Norway and Finland, with as little
success as it had in the United States.
   Today, advertising alcoholic beverages is forbidden. Unlike other
stores, liquor outlets are closed evenings and weekends. ``The idea
is that alcohol shouldn't be too available or too cheap,'' Hibell
says.
   The cheapest scotch is sold in Sweden at $24 for a fifth, and for
$32 in Norway. In Finland, a bottle of good 12-year-old scotch is
now up to $60.
   Tight regulation on liquor supplies created an underground market
for moonshine. In Norway, police arrested two men last March who
claimed to be horse breeders, but who were accused of building
stills in their stalls producing 1,000 liters a day.
   Figures published in Sweden say about 10 percent of the alcohol
sold is moonshine.
   Swedish statistics say 3,274 people died in 1986 from alcoholism,
cirrhosis of the liver and other diseases in which alcohol was a
probable factor. That figure compares with 1,256 alcohol-related
deaths in 1965.
   About 9 percent of fatal traffic accidents are linked to
drinking, according to figures compiled by Hibell's organization.
   There is some evidence of a long-term improvement. Surveys of
drinking habits among conscripted soldiers show that those who
reported getting drunk at least several times a month dropped from
68 percent in 1971 to 42 percent in 1987.
   The willingness to drink at any price means enormous tax income
for the governments.
   In 1987, Finland earned 8.5 percent of its national budget from
its alcohol tax, almost enough to pay its entire health care bill,
including medical research.
   Sweden reckoned on $1.31 billion in alcohol revenue in its 1989
budget, and plowed back $8.6 million to fight alcoholism.
   Of the $24 a Swede pays for a bottle of whisky, the state-owned
importer takes $1.46 for buying, bottling, labeling and distributing
the drink to the retailer. The state-owned retailer, Systembolaget,
takes 93 cents. The rest, $21.61, is tax.
   Drinking habits are changing, largely due to government efforts
steering people away from the brutally strong locally distilled
spirits and vodkas to wine and beer.
   ``We have become a wine-drinking country in the last 10 years,''
says Goran Sandberg, a director of the Wine and Spirit Corp.,
Sweden's state-owned importer. ``We have grown up gastronomically.''
   As the sole importer for an entire nation, the company wields
power in the wine-making world far outstripping Sweden's comparative
size. The Swedes helped establish Australian vineyards, buying half
the wine exports of that country on the opposite side of the globe.
   The company boasts being the world's largest customer of wine,
importing 100 million liters a year from 27 countries. The wine is
stored in caverns originally built for the defense department as
bomb shelters.

   For George Bush, this week's education summit
with the nation's governors provides a unique opportunity to redeem
a campaign pledge to become ``the education president.'' But the
meeting could also leave him vulnerable to blame for the failings of
America's schools as no president has ever been.
   By convening the governors for only the third time in the
nation's history, the president has raised expectations that under
his leadership the country will find ways to remedy persistent
shortcomings in its schools.
   Most of the meetings at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville on Wednesday and Thursday will take place behind
closed doors. The White House says the governors wanted it that way.
   ``We're going to have some roll-up-your-sleeve meetings,'' said
the president, who wants the summit to produce ``new ideas that can
help us develop national educational goals and objectives.''
   America's schools are ``not making the grade,'' complained Bush,
citing a recent comparison of 13-year-olds in a dozen countries that
placed American students last in math and near the bottom in science.
   ``We're spending more money on education than most other
countries, and frankly getting less in terms of our investment,'' he
told reporters last week.
   ``The educational system is basically well-fed, but it's
undernourished,'' said Bush. ``We must find innovative, accountable
ways to improve performance.''
   The first time a president summoned the states' chief executives
to a summit was in 1908, when Theodore Roosevelt brought them
together to discuss how to conserve America's natural resources; the
second time was in 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt sought their
advice on the Great Depression.
   By investing this session with the stature of a summit, the
president has aroused hopes that, as Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton put
it, Bush will ``assume some personal responsibility for the future
of the quality of education.''
   ``Once you pick up this ball, you pretty well got to run with it.
If you try to put it down after the summit's over, then I think you
have dashed expectations, disappointed people, a divided country,''
said Clinton, a Democrat who tried but failed to increase taxes this
year to raise teacher salaries.
   Apart from Bush's education secretary, Lauro F. Cavazos, no
educators will take part in the deliberations, and the governors
have been instructed to bring just one aide each to the table.
   Unlike a superpower summit or the annual economic parlay of
America and its allies, the Virginia meeting will not be propelled
by legions of striped-pants aides toiling behind the scenes to agree
on accords in advance for the political leaders to ratify.
   Bush appears intent on hearing first-hand testimony from the
governors _ many of them veterans of battles over school reform in
their states _ on which ideas hold the most promise.
   Bush has already indicated his interest in hearing success
stories on how to recruit and keep teachers, how to keep drugs and
crime out of schools and how to give parents more choice over which
public school their child attends.
   Eventually, the president will propose new education goals for
the nation, not at the end of this summit but at a later date,
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Bush, like Ronald Reagan before him, has been an enthusiastic
backer of efforts in Minnesota and elsewhere to give parents more
choice in public education. The rationale is that public schools
will be put on their mettle if forced to compete for students
instead of relying on a neighborhood monopoly.
   Bush also backs expanded aid for magnet schools, which strive for
excellence through academic specialties.
   The president has lauded New Jersey's successful experiment with
an alternative certification program that allows non-education
majors into the teaching profession.
   Virtually every state has raised graduation standards since the
scorching 1983 report ``A Nation At Risk,'' written by a Reagan
administration panel, and teacher salaries have spurted ahead faster
than inflation.
   But American pupils still lag behind their counterparts in other
industrialized nations on virtually every international study.
Scores have stagnated on college entrance tests.
   America'a schools are beset with drug and dropout problems
unheard of in Japan, which graduates nearly all of its teen-agers
from high school.
   Bush, in a public television documentary last spring, said he
viewed the three most pressing problems facing America's schools as
``drugs, drugs and drugs.''
   The federal budget deficit makes it difficult for Bush to promise
major resources to carry out education initiatives.
   He sent Congress on April 5 a modest $441 million package of
proposed additions to the Education Department's nearly $22 billion
budget.
   More than half the requested money _ $250 million _ would go to
create a Presidential Merit Schools awards program, providing cash
grants to top schools. In addition, $100 million would be earmarked
for magnet schools.
   The proposal has made little headway on Capitol Hill, although
the House last week passed a small component: scholarships for math
and science majors who become teachers.
   Cavazos says the Charlottesville summit is just ``the beginning''
of Bush's efforts to begin a national dialogue on education.
   But after six years of school reform and literally scores of
reports ruminating on what is wrong with America's schools, many
educators are impatient for results.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers,
warns, ``It will be a terrible letdown and a waste if the summit
deals with trivialities, if ... symbolism is all the president has
in mind, and the education summit turns out to be just another media
event.''

<HEAD>Sony Chairman Says Trade Imbalance Caused by ``Attractiveness'' of
Goods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trade imbalance between the United
States and Japan is caused by the difference in ``attractiveness''
of the nations' goods, not price, the chairman of Sony Corp. told
world business executives.
   ``The answer does not lie in protection for high-tech
industries,'' Akio Morita said Monday. ``Protectionism runs counter
to free market principles and, with the lack of external
competition, would only encourage inefficient industries, which are
unable to market their products outside of their protected market.
   ``The real key to competitiveness,'' he said, ``lies not in trade
policy but in such areas as increasing investment, strengthening
commercial R&amp;D and above all, increasing the quality and spirit of
the labor force.''
   Akio, speaking to 500 business leaders from 62 countries
attending the International Industrial Conference, said investments
in improving industrial competitiveness must be viewed as a
long-term proposition.
   ``Perhaps my most basic message is that both the U.S. government
and U.S. corporations should shift their time horizons,'' he said.
``Investments are needed today that will pay dividends in 10, 20 or
30 years.''
   Morita also said ``international trade is now being shaken by
emotional politicization of the trade imbalance.''
   ``I must say that the politicians and governments around the
world are not sufficiently aware of the reality of an
ever-developing global-scale economy or a borderless economy,'' he
said. ``The borderless economy has developed in such a speed and
scale exceeding our foresight and imagination.''
   Noting the foreign exchange involving billions of dollars, yen
and German marks, he said imports and exports of tangible goods are
not the only items that generate big money. Intellectual properties,
such as patents, know-how and music, also are valuable, he said.
   ``In my view, bilateral trade is made up of numerous `buy and
sell' transactions between companies in the two nations. An
imbalance is the difference in the sum of these transactions over a
given time.''
   It is important to Americans and the world economy that U.S.
industry regain its competitiveness, he said.
   Later, Jacques Delors, president of the Commission of the
European Communities, discussed the effort to remove trade barriers
between European Community nations by 1992.
   Delors said he saw no reason that the deadline for achieving a
single market would not be reached, despite difficulties in coming
to agreement on the automotive, transportation, energy, and
telecommunications industries.
   ``In those four fields the antagonisms between the nations are
very destructive, and the interests of firms and the interests of
nations are mixed,'' he said. ``I must spend all my time to convince
the 12 governments to fulfill the single market and to not accept
exceptions ... because the advantage of a single market is enormous
in those sectors.''
   Delors provoked nervous laughter among the executives when he
responded to a question about whether Europeans would develop
different trade policies for the United States and Japan.
   ``It depends on the Japanese and the Americans,'' he said. ``For
example, when I explain the process of reciprocity to American
businessmen, they understand. They are very positive about the
concept. Unfortunately, when I explain this global concept to
Japanese, it is more difficult to have an understanding.
   ``And frankly, we must be very tough with the negotiations with
Japan,'' he said, ``because it is very difficult for us, our
businesses, our banks, to penetrate the Japanese market.''
   The remark drew scattered laughs and light applause from the
audience, which included dozens of Japanese _ among them Morita, who
chaired the proceedings and introduced Delors.
   ``Excuse me, but it is a matter of fact,'' Delors said to more
nervous laughter.
   When Delors left the podium, Morita thanked him for his remarks
and added, ``I promise you to make Japanese easier to understand.''

<HEAD>Sell-Off in Junk Bonds Could Be Blessing in Disguise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last week's sharp sell-off in the junk bond
market could be a blessing in disguise for the economy by making it
more difficult for companies to take on much more of the high-cost
debt, some analysts say.
   By scaring off investors, the plunge in junk bonds could make it
nearly impossible for companies to sell new junk issues unless there
is a strong likelihood they are able to make payments on it over the
long run, said John Lonski, senior economist for Moody's Investors
Service.
   ``You can't continue to leverage forever. There has to be some
end to what's taking place, and sooner is better than later,''
Lonski said Monday.
   Issuers of junk bonds _ are high-interest-rate debt securities
often used by companies with poor credit ratings _ must pay high
interest rates to attract investors. In recent years, the securities
have been widely used for such ventures as mergers and acquisitions.
   But if the economy sours, issuers could be forced to default,
adding to the economy's troubles.
   Quoted bids for junk bonds stabilized Monday after last week's
sell-off, although analysts said trading in the most speculative
issues nearly ground to a halt.
   ``People feel it's too late to sell and too early to buy,'' said
Marshall B. Front, an economist at the Chicago investment firm of
Stein Roe &amp; Farnham.
   A cash crunch at Campeau Corp., the Canadian retailing giant,
triggered last week's price plunge, carrying down even relatively
secure issues. Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. conditionally agreed
Friday to loan Campeau $250 million in a deal that was expected to
give the Toronto developer greater influence over Campeau's
management and a greater ownership stake.
   After being carried downward by Campeau's problems, the
higher-grade junk bonds such as Stone Container Corp., Kroger Co.,
Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
were quoted as much as } point higher Monday. A point equals $10 on
a bond with a face value of $1,000.
   Meanwhile, the bid on one issue of Campeau's Allied Stores Corp.
unit was quoted down slightly to 26 cents on the dollar from 27. But
with bond owners not willing to offer the issue at less than 35
cents, there was virtually no trading, market participants said.
   The bid for Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. bonds rose
10 to 55, but was still well below the asking price of 65.
   Companies that were planning to issue junk bonds in coming weeks
might postpone or restructure their offerings because of the
sell-off, which pushed up yields and made financing more expensive,
Lonski said.
   If wary investors demand higher and higher interest on junk
bonds, companies may be less able to rely on the low-grade
securities for financing. They then may either pull back from
speculative, riskier ventures or finance them in a less risky way,
such as by issuing stock.
   The economy is approaching the seventh birthday of the longest
U.S. peacetime expansion in history. But some economists say it may
not last much longer.
   Elliot Janeway, in a column in The New York Times on Sunday,
warned that dangerously high levels of inventories are accumulating
in autos, housing, retailing and metals.
   James Buchan, in a column in Monday's editions of the
London-based Financial Times, said the shakeout in junk bonds is the
latest phase of a ``rolling liquidation'' that in past years had
wrung speculation out of agriculture and the energy markets.
   ``The secret is to shake out the speculators in batches not, as
in the 1920s, all together,'' Buchan said.
   James Grant, publisher of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, said he
believed Buchan's assessment seemed on target. ``It's always good
news when false values are exposed for being false,'' he said in an
interview.

<HEAD>Harbert Offers $385 Million for Birmingham Steel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harbert Corp. on Monday offered about
$385 million for Birmingham Steel, a 5-year-old company that
prospered by buying older, often financially troubled steel mills at
bargain prices.
   Birmingham Steel President James Todd said the decision to sell
the company to Birmingham-based Harbert stemmed in part from a
desire to keep its headquarters in Birmingham.
   ``We have had a number of people express an interest in buying
out the company,'' he said.
   Harbert Corp. offered $30 a share in cash, or a total of about
$385 million for the company's stock. Harbert, an international
construction company, also would assume and refinance more than $100
million in Birmingham Steel debt.
   The company's stock closed Monday at $29.12{, up $4.50, in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Birmingham Steel had a profit of about $39 million in its latest
fiscal year on sales of more than $343 million.
   Harbert Corp. was founded by John M. Harbert III, a major
Birmingham Steel investor.
   A special committee of outside directors, formed by the company
to study a possible sale, recommended the Harbert offer after
determining there was little room for the stock's price to move
above the low $20s.
   The price has been depressed because of Birmingham Steel's 50
percent investment in redevelopment of a Houston, Texas, rolling
mill, which eventually will make flat-rolled sheet steel.
   Harbert, chairman of the company, said Birmingham Steel's success
and strong management team prompted him to make the offer. He
already owns less than 5 percent of the company's stock and sits on
its board of directors.
   ``We are knowledgable about this industry,'' he said.
   The offer must be approved by Birmingham Steel stockholders.

<HEAD>Datacrime Virus Scares Computer Owners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare data-destroying computer virus that will
attack personal computers after Oct. 12 is causing consternation
among computer owners who fear they will be among its relatively
small number of victims.
   Computer security firms and companies that supply anti-viral
software say they have been deluged by calls since word of the
``Datacrime'' virus was spread widely last week by the news media.
   ``Frankly, the virus isn't all that important a virus, yet this
phone is ringing off the hook,'' Ross Greenberg, a New Yorker who
makes a virus protector called Flu-Shot Plus, said late last week.
   ``The alarms that are going off absolutely staggered me,'' said
Winn Schwartau, president of American Computer Security Industries
Inc. in Nashville, Tenn. He said several government agencies and
Fortune 500 companies had contacted him about the virus.
   Greenberg said he has received maybe a half-dozen reports of the
virus since it surfaced earlier this year. The Computer Virus
Industry Association of Santa Clara, Calif., has received seven
reports, chairman John McAfee said Monday.
   In contrast, there have been thousands of reports of other
viruses. Far more people will be hit on Oct. 13 by the less harmful
but more widespread Jerusalem virus, also known as the PLO or Friday
the 13th virus.
   ``I'm more worried about spilling a cup of coffee on my keyboard
than I am about the Datacrime virus,'' Greenberg said.
   Computer viruses are pieces of software written by anonymous
programmers that make copies of themselves and spread from one
machine to another through infected floppy disks, office networks or
phone links such as computer bulletin boards.
   The Datacrime virus attacks the hard disk data-storage devices of
IBM-compatible personal computers that use Microsoft Corp.'s MS-DOS
operating system. It wipes out the directory section, making it
impossible for the disk's contents to be read.
   The virus is triggered when an infected program is used anytime
after the computer's internal clock passes Oct. 12, the traditional
date for Columbus Day. It is also known as the Columbus Day or
Icelandic virus.
   The virus was found lying dormant in computers by people who
noticed that some of their programs had swollen inexplicably.
Infected programs were turned over to experts who dismantled the
virus and found out how it worked and when it would be triggered.
   Computer security experts say the best thing computer users can
do to protect themselves from the Datacrime or any other virus is to
make backup copies every day of everything they want to save.
   ``People should make backups the way they brush their teeth in
the morning, like a basic part of hygiene,'' Greenberg said.
   Users can limit their exposure to viruses by staying away from
bootleg software while being cautious in their use of computer
bulletin boards and networks. But viruses have even been found in
new, store-bought software in a few rare instances.
   Several companies make software that scans programs for known
viruses, but those scanners won't pick up viruses they don't
recognize.
   Other programs stop a machine cold and alert the user when a
program tries to do something unauthorized, such as writing on an
off-limits portion of the hard disk. The latest versions allow users
to ``teach'' them to give fewer false alarms, which can be a major
annoyance.
   Once an infected program is found, the usual course is to erase
it and write over it with zeroes so it can't be resurrected by a
clever programmer. Some companies say they can delete a virus while
saving the infected program, while others say that approach is
unreliable.
   ``It's absolutely impossible for anybody to say we have a fix for
this,'' said Pamela Kane, president of Panda Systems of Wilmington,
Del.
   PC Magazine earlier this year gave its top ratings to Greenberg's
Flu-Shot Plus, a $10 program distributed through computer bulletin
boards, and Certus from FoundationWare Inc. of Cleveland, which
costs $189.
   The small group of people making virus detection or eradication
software also includes Panda Systems, the Computer Virus Industry
Association, McAfee's own Interpath Corp. and Raymond Glath's RG
Software Systems Inc. in Willow Grove, Pa.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Investigation Into Alleged Leaks In Milken Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered the Justice
Department to investigate whether the government has leaked
confidential information to the press about its case against
indicted financier Michael Milken.
   But U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said Monday she would not hold
a hearing on the leak allegations made by defense lawyers until
after Milken's trial, so as not to heighten publicity in the
racketeering and fraud case.
   Milken's lawyers last week asked Wood to order the government to
halt a ``constant stream'' of press leaks they claimed threatened
the right to a fair trial for the former head of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.'s junk bond division.
   ``We're very pleased with the court's decision to direct an
investigation into the alleged leaks,'' Milken attorney Martin
Flumenbaum said.
   Wood, who is presiding over the case, directed the U.S.
attorney's office and the Justice Department's Office of
Professional Responsibility to examine the alleged leaks by
government officials. She also requested private periodic reports on
the probe.
   But Wood also said there was no basis in the record for the
contention that the alleged leaks could only have come from
government sources.
   Milken was first named in news reports as the government's main
target shortly after now-jailed speculator Ivan Boesky agreed to
cooperate with the government's investigation of widespread Wall
Street corruption in late 1986. Boesky provided much of the
information used to indict Milken.
   Newspaper stories since then regularly have contained advance
details of the government's investigation and indictment plans.
Stories have appeared leading up to and containing the indictment
date as well as the charges.
   The motion cited stories published in The Wall Street Journal,
The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times.
   Milken's lawyers asked Wood to order the government to stop
leaking confidential material, hold a hearing to identify the
sources of the leaks, impose contempt sanctions on the leakers and
make public a Securities and Exchange Commission memo detailing
confidential testimony in the case that recently was written about
in the Post.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said the government had
requested an investigation of the alleged leaks, which defense
lawyers have protested regularly, before the motion was filed last
Wednesday.
   The judge also said the government should instruct the grand jury
in the case not to pay attention to any outside reports on the case,
which prosecutors said they already had done.
   Milken, his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce
Newberg were charged in March in a 98-count fraud and racketeering
indictment that alleges insider trading, securities violations and
other crimes. They have pleaded innocent and a March 1990 trial is
set.

<HEAD>Hertz Ends Participation In Airline Frequent-Flier Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hertz Corp. says it is pulling out of airline
frequent-flier programs because the growth of mileage awards had
made them too costly for the company.
   Other national car-rental concerns indicated they might follow
the industry leader.
   But analysts said Monday that while the withdrawal of car-rental
companies would make frequent-flier programs less attractive, it did
not mean their demise.
   ``Anytime some feature of the program is eliminated it is less
potent as a marketing tool,'' said Tom Longman, an analyst with Bear
Stearns &amp; Co. ``But these programs are here to stay. They will just
evolve a bit more.''
   Hertz, the nation's largest car-rental company, said the rate of
growth of mileage points had doubled in each of the last two years.
The value of the redeemed credits last year exceeded $15 million,
said Hertz spokeswoman Brenda Rigby.
   ``The program has become very expensive to participate in,'' Ms.
Rigby said. ``Double and triple mileage programs have become
increasingly common in the last couple of years so the frequency of
the awards has grown.''
   Ms. Rigby said that because 60 percent of Hertz customers are
business travelers, Hertz feels it is giving incentives to people
who likely would rent from the company anyway.
   Hertz, based in Park Ridge, N.J., said it would end its
participation with Delta Air Lines, America West Airlines, Eastern
Airlines and Continental Airlines at the end of the year.
   Frequent fliers on these carriers will have until Dec. 31 to earn
mileage for Hertz coupons and will have until the end of 1990 to use
the coupons, Hertz said.
   Hertz also plans to discontinue partnerships with American
Airlines, United Airlines and USAir as those contracts come up for
renewal after Dec. 31, Ms. Rigby said.
   American Airlines initiated the frequent-flier program in 1981 in
an effort to draw and keep customers. Other airlines soon followed.
Hertz and other national car rental concerns as well as hotels
joined with the airlines hoping to generate new business.
   Travelers in frequent-flier programs earn credits for miles they
fly, nights they stay in hotels and each time they rent cars.
Credits can be redeemed for free air travel, hotel stays and car
rentals.
   But in recent years airlines have been cutting back on the
programs because they were forced to give out too many free trips as
the programs became popular. Hertz said it is having a similar
problem. In addition, higher air fares this year have softened the
car-rental business, analysts said.
   Avis Inc. said Monday it is evaluating its own participation with
frequent fliers in light of Hertz' move.
   ``Obviously they're expensive,'' said Avis spokeswoman Demetria
Mudar. ``This sheds a different light on things _ an industry leader
making a major move.''
   National Car Rental System Inc. said it also may have an
announcement soon on its frequent-flier participation.
   ``We're taking a hard look at the Hertz move,'' said Michael J.
Olsen, spokesman for National Car Rental.
   Budget Rent A Car Corp. said it is not currently considering
dropping its frequent-flier partnerships.
   ``The frequent-flier program is very costly and by itself is not
worth the cost,'' said Martin Smircich, president of Budget's North
American Group. ``But the airlines that we are participating with
have been good to work for and our participation is not limited
strictly to giving out mileage.''

<HEAD>S&amp;L Industry Still Largest Originator of Home Mortgages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the savings and loan crisis, the thrift
industry continues to be the largest originator of home mortgages, a
government study reported.
   Thrifts retain the lead with 43 percent of single family
mortgages and 46 percent of multifamily mortgages, according to the
Office of Thrift Supervision study released Monday.
   Part of the thrift industry crisis was blamed on some savings and
loans that engaged in risky investments such as speculative
commercial real estate projects and junk bonds rather than home
mortgages.
   The recently enacted savings and loan law, which authorized
spending $50 billion to bail out the industry, requires thrifts to
raise the level of housing and housing-related loans in their
portfolios to 70 percent from the current 60 percent. S&amp;Ls have five
years to phase out their risky ventures.
   Savings and loan companies were estimated to have held nearly
$780 billion in mortgages at the end of 1988, 36 percent of the $2
trillion home mortgage market and only 4 percent less than their
1970 share, the study said.

<HEAD>Company to Upgrade Emission Systems, Fix Seat Belts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. says it is recalling nearly
493,000 Escorts and Mercury Lynxes to fix faulty emission-control
systems and 67,156 Tracers because of an apparent seat-belt defect.
   Repairs of either problem will be made at no charge regardless of
a vehicle's age or mileage, Ford and the Environmental Protection
Agency said Monday in separate statements.
   The vehicles recalled for emission-system improvements have
1.9-liter engines and include the 1985 Ford Escort and Mercury Lynx
and the 1986 Escort, Lynx and Ford EXP.
   Excessive emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide were
discovered during routine EPA tests of 1985 models, EPA spokeswoman
Martha Casey said.
   ``We're constantly checking various classes of vehicle to see if
a few years after leaving the assembly line, they're still meeting
standards,'' Casey said.
   The EPA didn't request the Ford recall but ``we sort of term
these recalls EPA-influenced,'' Casey said.
   Ford spokesman Mike Parris in Michigan attributed the problem to
normal wear.
   ``A few years back, the equipment was not as good as it was
now,'' Parris said. ``Some of the valves and small hoses and pieces
are starting to wear out and we're having to replace them with
upgraded pieces.''
   The Ford repairs will involve changing the choke system,
distributor spark advance and the air-injection system, a
pollution-control system that helps the catalytic converter control
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Dealers also will install more
durable crankcase ventilation valves, also known as PCV valves, EPA
said.
   Cars made for sale in California are excluded from the Ford
recall because they are manufactured to meet that state's emission
standards, which are more stringent than EPA's, Parris said.
   No California cars have been found to fall short of the federal
standards, Casey said.
   The Tracers being recalled were made in the 1988 model year.
There are 66,314 in the United States and 842 in Canada, Ford said.
   In some cases, it has become difficult to extend the front-seat
lap-shoulder belts for buckling unless they are pulled very slowly,
the company said. A few of the belts may lock and be impossible to
pull out.
   Owners having trouble extending the belts are asked to return the
car to the dealer for inspection and repairs if necessary, the
automaker said.

<HEAD>Macmillan Agrees to Buy Merrill Publishing for $260 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Macmillan Inc., the publishing giant controlled
by Britain's Robert Maxwell, has agreed to buy the textbook concern
Merrill Publishing for $260 million in cash.
   The deal would swell Macmillan's share of the educational
publishing market, while enabling Merrill's owner, the
privately-held Bell &amp; Howell Co., to make a graceful retreat from
that fiercely competitive business.
   Merrill Publishing, based in Columbus, Ohio, publishes textbooks,
software and other learning materials for the elementary, high
school and college markets, and officials said it was expected to
post more than $100 million in revenue this year.
   The company, founded in 1842, has been owned since 1967 by Bell &amp;
Howell, which is based in Skokie, Ill.
   Jerry Herb, vice president-administration at Bell &amp; Howell, said
his company decided to sell Merrill Publishing for strategic reasons.
   He said consolidation in the educational publishing field put
Merrill at a competitive disadvantage with larger companies. He said
Bell &amp; Howell considered making some acquisitions in this field but
found few potential candidates and decided several months ago to
sell Merrill.
   The deal is subject to regulatory approval.
   ``We are extremely pleased to acquire this excellent publisher,''
Maxwell was quoted as saying in a two-sentence announcement of the
deal.
   Maxwell had told shareholders of Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC
last week at their annual meeting in London that the company was
negotiating for a medium-sized educational publishing business in
North America.
   Bell &amp; Howell was acquired in May 1988 for $640 million by a
group led by Texas investor Robert M. Bass and including senior
management. Before that deal was completed, Maxwell had indicated he
was interested in pursuing Bell &amp; Howell but never made a formal
offer.
   Maxwell subsequently paid $2.5 billion for Macmillan, which is a
leading educational publisher and has a growing information services
business.
   Earlier this year, Macmillan combined its elementary, secondary
and vocational education publishing businesses with those of
McGraw-Hill Inc. in a 50-50 joint venture called the
Macmillan-McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co.
   Macmillan continues to operate its own college textbook
publishing business separately.
   Buzz Ellis, president of the school division at Merrill, said
Merrill expects to post more than $100 million in revenue this year,
and employs about 650 people at three sites in the Columbus
metropolitan area.
   The news release did not say how the Merrill operations would be
combined with those of Macmillan, and company spokeswoman Suzanne
Cummings said she did now know what the plans were.
   But if Merrill's elementary and secondary school operations were
combined with those of the Macmillan-McGraw-Hill joint venture, it
would become the nation's second largest publisher for elementary
and secondary schools, according to Educational Marketer, a trade
newsletter from Knowledge Industry Publications Inc. of White
Plains, N.Y.
   Educational Marketer estimated that Merrill derived $70 million
in revenue from elementary and secondary school publishing in 1988.
That would lift the Macmillan-McGraw-Hill total for 1988 to $440
million, second only to $476.5 million at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc.
   In the nation's college publishing rankings, Macmillan ranks 10th
at $58.3 million and the addition of Merrill's estimated $20 million
to $25 million in 1988 revenue would leave the combined operation
far behind the leader, Simon &amp; Schuster at $218.2 million in 1988,
according to Educational Marketer.
   Herb said the proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce part
of Bell &amp; Howell's debt of about $500 million and to finance
internal growth of its remaining businesses, which include
republishing databases and a mail handling operation.

<HEAD>Questar Joins Canadian, Swiss Firms in Marketing Refueling Device</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Questar Corp. has joined with Canadian and
Swiss firms to market a device that allows natural gas-powered
vehicles to be refueled at home and other places where natural gas
is available.
   B.C. Gas of Vancouver, British Columbia, Sulzer Brothers Limited
of Winterthur, Switzerland, and Questar have formed FuelMaker Corp.
to develop, make and market the device, Questar announced Monday.
   The new company will be based in Vancouver with offices in Salt
Lake City and Toronto.
   The compressor developed by Sulzer engineers connects directly to
the natural gas supply at a customer's home or business.
   A small-diameter hose with a quick-disconnect coupling is used as
the gas is boosted to the 3,000 pounds per square inch pressure
needed to fill vehicles' natural gas fuel cylinders.
   Refueling can be done in about five hours, while the car is
unattended, Questar said.
   ``The growing national and international interest in protecting
the environment is creating a lot of interest in natural gas as a
clean alternative to gasoline,'' said Michael E. Benefield,
FuelMaker general manager.
   Mountain Fuel Supply Co., a Questar subsidiary that provides
natural gas service in Utah and southwestern Wyoming, is converting
100 of its service vehicles to natural gas. It recently opened its
second natural gas filling station.
   FuelMaker plans to market the device through natural gas
distrubiton utilities.
   ``We now have a backlog of orders for the first production series
and are very enthusiastic about the prospects for FuelMaker,'' said
Bruce Vernon, FuelMaker marketing manager.

<HEAD>Brazil Said Seeking 90-Day Extension on Foreign Debt Servicing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil plans to ask the International Monetary
Fund for a 90-day extension on payments to service its $110 billion
debt because it cannot meet its obligations, a high-ranking official
of the country's central bank was quoted as saying.
   The Mexican government news agency quoted Wadico Waldir Bucchi, a
governor of the Brazilian Central Bank, as saying President Jose
Sarney's administration is seeking to gain time in order to receive
a $600 loan still pending from the IMF which will be used to service
the debt.
   Bucchi said the loan is part of a credit-line the IMF extended
last year but which Brazil has not received yet. Brazil cannot pay
its creditors until it gets it.
   Bucchi was quoted by Notimex as saying he is sure the IMF will
grant the 90-day extension when he meets Friday with officials of
that organization in New York.
   ``Brazil is certain the great majority of creditor banks will
respond positively to its petition,'' Bucchi said.
   Notimex said that Bucchi spoke with reporters in the Caribbean
resort of Cancun, Mexico, where the heads of central banks from
Latin America, Spain and the Philippines began meeting to discuss
international strategies to deal with the IMF and the World Bank.
   Latin America alone owes an estimated $104 trillion, and Brazil
has the biggest foreign debt in the Third World followed by Mexico
with $107.4 billion.
   The meeting began in a climate of tension caused by rumors that
Brazil may declare a moratorium on $1.6 billion in interest payments
that came due last Friday.
   However, Sergio Amaral, adviser on international relations in
Brazil's Treasury Ministry, said those reports were wrong.
   ``It's not true,'' Amaral told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview. ``We are going to look for a solution quickly
to reach an agreement with banks.''
   Amaral would not elaborate on Brazil's plans.
   Brazil has previously suspended payments and, according to news
reports in Brazil, such a moratorium would help the South American
giant maintain its reserves of $6 billion but would hurt its chances
of obtaining fresh money from international lenders.
   ``It is our own political economic mistakes that have determined
that development in Latin America is lagging behind the rest of the
world,'' said Miguel Mancera Aguayo, director of Mexico's central
bank at the opening of Monday's meetings.
   Mancera said that business activity increased 50 percent over the
past 10 years in Latin America, but has not kept pace with
industrial nations ``because the powerful nations have closed their
markets and paid less for prime materials they import,'' according
to the independent Excelsior news agency.
   He said Latin American nations should find their own solutions
and not wait for outside answers ``because there have been failures
in the management of the political economy that have aggravated the
problems.''

<HEAD>Sale of Sears Tower Still Up in the Air</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. has plenty of time to sell
its towering headquarters building, analysts say _ if it sells it at
all.
   A no-sale option reportedly is under consideration by the
nation's largest retailer since its prospective sale of Sears Tower
to a Canadian developer got sidetracked last week.
   Sears declined to comment Monday on the report in this week's
Crain's Chicago Business, which did not identify its sources for the
story.
   One option being considered, according to Crain's, was a
refinancing plan that would amount to a new mortgage on the property.
   Among Sears watchers, the item was received as one more rumor
swirling in the wind around the world's tallest building.
   ``I'm convinced the tower is to be sold,'' said Walter Loeb, a
retail analyst who follows Sears for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New
York. But, he added, ``I think it may be sitting on the shelf a
while longer.''
   Retailing analysts said Sears' investment value would not suffer
if the tower were not sold by year's end, as the company had planned.
   But Sears had planned to use proceeds from the sale to pay off
the money it borrowed for its stock repurchase program.
   And reducing its debt, reported by Sears as $2 billion in a July
31 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, remains a
powerful incentive for Sears to sell its tower, Loeb said.
   Some observers believe Sears could still end up selling the
110-story, 1,707-foot landmark to Olympia &amp; York Developments Inc.,
the Toronto-based company that, until last week, appeared ready to
buy Sears Tower for a widely reported $1.04 billion.
   The prospective sale got stalled in a dispute over which party
should shoulder a steep increase in property taxes likely to result
from a post-sale reassessment.
   Olympia &amp; York declined to comment on the tower sale, or on
whether the firm was backing out in order to devote more resources
to bankrolling the cash-starved Canadian retailer Campeau Corp.
   Olympia &amp; York conditionally agreed Friday to loan Campeau $250
million in a deal that was expected to give the Toronto developer
greater influence over Campeau's management and a greater ownership
stake.
   Sears announced last October it would sell the tower as part of a
restructuring plan that included an everyday low-price retailing
policy, the transfer of its retailing division headquarters from the
tower to suburban Hoffman Estates in the early 1990s, and a buyback
of 40 million shares, or about 10 percent, of its outstanding stock.
   Olympia &amp; York emerged as the leading bidder in July but the
negotiations were rocky. Sears apparently insisted its name remain
on the building after the sale and the Canadians reportedly had
trouble finding a large tenant to anchor the 2 million square feet
of office space Sears is vacating in the 15-year-old building.
   British-based publisher Maxwell Communications Corp. was said to
have been interested in consolidating its Chicago operations in
Sears Tower but is now considering other quarters, including a
125-story skyscraper proposed by local developers Miglin-Beitler
Developments Inc. that would be taller than the Sears Tower.
   ``We submitted a bid (to Maxwell) on Friday,'' said
Miglin-Beitler spokesman Mark Jarasek.

   Ford Motor Co.'s 1989 Thunderbird SC,
Motor Trend magazine's ``Car of the Year,'' is now on the list of

   Buyers of the Thunderbird SC, which stands for super coupe, and
the Mercury Cougar XR-7, both built in Ford's Lorain, Ohio, plant,
will receive a $1,500 rebate or a choice of low-interest financing
programs, the automaker said.
   There weren't any incentives on those cars until Monday.
   Ford also boosted incentives to $750 from $500 for the Probe GL
and LX models and to $1,000 from $500 for the Probe GT.
   The new programs expire Oct. 4. Ford last week introduced its
line of cars and trucks for the 1990 model year.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Unchanged in August</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines pvs files; inserts new 6th graf, `In another ...,'
with housing construction report. This also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer inflation turned in its best
performance in more than three years in August as prices remained
frozen at the previous month's level, the government reported today.
   It was the first time that the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index has not registered an increase since April 1986, when it fell
by 0.3 percent. The August performance was credited to a 4.2 percent
plunge in gasoline prices, the steepest one-month drop in three
years.
   Falling energy prices have given consumers three consecutive
months of good news on inflation. Prices were up a modest 0.2
percent in both June and July.
   This was in sharp contrast to the situation earlier in 1989 when
steep hikes in gasoline and food led to a surge in prices pushed the
inflation rate up to an annual level of 6.7 percent for the first
five months of the year.
   But with the price moderation in the three months since then,
consumer prices are now rising at a more modest annual rate of 4.8
percent, up only slightly from the 4.4 percent increase for all of
1988.
   In another economic report, meantime, the Commerce Department
said housing construction fell 5 percent in August for the largest
decline in six months. New homes and apartments were built at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million units, down from
1.42 million units in July.
   While some economists say the country is in for moderation in
inflation, other analysts are worried that underlying inflationary
pressures are being masked by the plunge in energy costs.
   These economists say energy prices, which surged early in the
year only to fall back somewhat in the past three months, are likely
to begin rising again this fall, reflecting higher crude oil costs.
   Gasoline prices shot up 21.2 percent in the first five months of
the year, then fell 1 percent in June, 2.2 percent in July and 4.2
percent in August. The August decline was the biggest drop since a
5.2 percent decrease in August 1986.
   Natural gas and electricity prices registered a 0.2 percent
decline while heating oil costs fell by 0.9 percent last month.
   Food prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in August following a 0.3
percent July gain. Those figures were in sharp contrast to the first
nine months of the year, when the lingering effects of the 1988
drought sent food costs racing ahead at a 9.3 percent annual rate.
   For August, declines in the cost of pork and poultry were
partially offset by increases for beef, fish and eggs.
   Fruit and vegetable prices fell 0.2 percent in August following a
0.5 percent increase in July.
   Clothing costs fell a sharp 1.5 percent in August, helping to
push apparel prices down by 3.4 percent over the past three months.
The price drop was credited to larger than normal end-of-season
price cuts for women's and girls' clothing.
   The various changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at
124.6 in August, meaning that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods
costing $100 in the base period of 1982-84 would have cost $124.60
last month.
   The price of goods and services, other than food and energy, rose
0.2 percent in August after climbing by 0.4 percent in July. It is
this underlying inflation rate that has some analysts concerned that
the battle against rising prices has not been won.
   ``The U.S. inflation rate is not as good as it looks,'' said
David Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting
firm in Lexington, Mass.
   ``We are seeing a slow acceleration of inflation but for the next
few months that will be hidden by soft energy and food prices,'' he
said.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm, agreed with
this assessment, saying the big plunge in gasoline prices is coming
to an end, reflecting the rise in crude oil prices in recent weeks.
   ``Gasoline prices will not fall any further while prices other
than food and energy will continue to rise on a broad front,'' Evans
said.
   Still, analysts believe the inflation rate for all of 1989 will
not be too much worse than in 1988, when consumer prices rose 4.4
percent.
   The Bush administration is projecting that consumer prices will
rise 5 percent for all of 1989 _ a forecast that is generally in
line with most private economists.
   The Federal Reserve is a bit less optimistic, saying it was
looking for an inflation rate of between 5 percent and 5.5 percent
this year.
   Many economists believe the Fed is unlikely to ease up on credit
anytime soon, in spite of the recent good news on inflation, because
of its more pessimistic assumptions about underlying inflationary
pressures.

   Housing construction fell 5 percent in August,
the largest decline in six months, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million units, down
from 1.42 million units in July. Starts had gained 1.3 percent in
July and 7.5 percent in June.
   The August drop was the largest since a12.7 percent fall last
February.
   It was the first decline since May for the housing industry,
which had been among the sectors hardest hit earlier this year as
the Federal Reserve drove up interest rates to slow economic growth
and control inflation.
   Fixed mortgage rates, which peaked at 11.22 percent in March, had
fallen to 9.68 percent by Aug. 4, according to the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Co. They stood at 10.05 percent last week.
   Construction starts fell earlier this year for four straight
months before rebounding in June, the longest string of declines
since activity slowed for five months in a row from February through
June 1987. The May level of 1.31 million starts was the slowest pace
since the 1.30 million rate in December 1982.
   But despite the rebound, the Federal National Mortgage
Association _ better known as Fannie Mae _ said single-family starts
at the end of July were running about 3.9 percent below their
average for 1988.
   Total housing starts during the first eight months of the year
are down 4.7 percent from the same period of 1988.
   In addition to its effect on construction jobs and the building
materials industries, the housing industry also has an impact on
other housing-related businesses such as home furnishings and
appliances.
   Construction of single-family homes last month fell 2.5 percent
to an annual rate of 1 million units. Single-family starts had risen
5.9 percent in July after falling 0.5 percent in June.
   Apartment construction fell 11.4 percent in August to an annual
rate of 350,000 units. It had fallen 9 percent in July after rising
31.1 percent in June.
   The Northeast suffered the largest percentage decline, down 28.2
percent to 140,000 units at an annual rate. It was the largest drop
in the region since a 29 percent decline in March and the lowest
number of starts since 128,000 units in December 1982.
   The Midwest suffered a 9.7 percent decline to 241,000 units and
the West declined 7.4 percent to 398,000 units.
   Only the South registered a gain, up 7.9 percent to 574,000 units.
   Applications for multifamily building permits, a barometer of
future multifamily housing activity, were up 8.8 percent in August,
following drops of 13.5 percent in July and 1.8 percent in June.
   Overall applications for building permits rose 3.5 percent after
falling 2.1 percent in July.

   The stock market inched higher in early dealings
today after two government reports that suggested a further easing
of inflationary pressures.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.90 points at
2,689.40 after a half-hour of trading at 10 a.m. EDT.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 523 issues up, 400 down and 507 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 21.50 million shares.
   The government reported today that consumer prices remained
unchanged in August, the best inflation performance in more than
three years. The August performance was due mainly to falling
gasoline prices, the Labor Department said.
   The Commerce Department also reported today that housing
construction fell 5 percent in August, the largest decline in six
months.
   Wall Street analysts said the reports were good news for the
stock market because it suggested a slowdown in economic growth and
that the Federal Reserve may ease credit further.
   ``The numbers were favorable; both were below expectations,''
said Larry Wachtel, vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   Nevertheless, volume was light as players remained cautious,
Wachtel said.
   ``You don't get the sense that we're out of the woods yet after
gains in the last two days,'' Wachtel said. ``There's a sense of
caution prevailing.''
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.25 to 192.68.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down
0.19 at 397.31.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.92 to
2,687.50.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 751 up, 693
down and 512 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 136.94 million
shares, down from 234.87 million Friday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. today
announced a system for writing computer programs with the help of
computer programs.
   The world's biggest computer company held a news conference to
announce its commitment to ``computer-aided software engineering,''
which is intended to make software more reliable and faster to
develop.
   More than 30 companies expressed their support for IBM's
blueprint, another demonstration of IBM's influence in the
large-computer business.
   Disorganized writing of software has led to sprawling,
patched-together, unmanageable programs that take up valuable
programmers' time and stall innovation. The problem has become so
acute that corporate chief executives are pressing their computer
chiefs for a solution.
   ``The real driving force behind our industry is that we have got
to figure out how to build better software, faster,'' Kim Addington,
vice president for marketing at KnowledgeWare Inc. in Atlanta, said
Monday in advance of the announcement.
   Sales of tools for computer-aided software engineering already
total about $300 million a year, even though fewer than 10 percent
of customers are even dabbling in it, according to CASE Research
Corp. of Bellevue, Wash.
   CASE Research expects sales to start jumping about a year from
now when software toolmakers have brought their products into line
with IBM's de facto industry standard.
   At least five years will be required to achieve largely automatic
programming, but IBM's commitment at least legitimizes the concept
of it, consultants say.
   ``This is the Holy Grail. The software industry is committing
itself to the IBM platform. They don't have to be cajoled into that;
they're doing it readily because they see the value of the rules
being established,'' Sam Albert, a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y.,
and former IBM software executive, said in an interview Monday.
   IBM said it will come out next June with a ``repository,'' a
library containing the information that all the different software
engineering tools need to do their jobs. Strict rules will ensure
that all toolmakers structure their information in a consistent way.
   The tools will help programmers at every stage, from the analysis
of a business problem, to the overall design of a software solution,
to the automatic generation and testing of code that actually
carries out the job.
   IBM said programs developed with its so-called AD-Cycle system
would all have the same look and feel, making them easier for users
to learn how to use.
   ``We believe our announcement today is an important event for
this world that runs on software,'' George Conrades, an IBM senior
vice president, said in a prepared statement.
   He said programmers' speed has lagged far behind the speed of the
computers themselves.
   ``It doesn't make sense for computers to process hundreds of
millions of instructions per second, while programmers process just
10 instructions per day,'' Conrades said.
   By automating, software toolmakers hope to keep programmers'
hands off of the actual code so they deal only with the higher-level
problems of analysis and design.
   ``A lot of research has shown that 60 to 70 percent of the
problems in systems are in the analysis and design, so let's put our
money where our problems are,'' Greg Boone, president of CASE
Research, said Monday.
   The unusual amount of cooperation with other software developers
_ some of which sell rival products _ reflects IBM's strategy of
forming partnerships instead of trying to do everything itself.
   By making it easier to write programs for IBM computers, IBM
hopes to sell more machines to existing customers and possibly
attract new customers, Albert said.
   Unisys Corp. has promoted computer-aided software engineering for
several years, but has a much smaller share of the big computer
market than IBM. igital Equipment Corp. has an uncertain strategy in
the field, CASE's Boone said.
   Hewlett-Packard, in contrast, is ``sort of the quiet giant'' in
computer-aided software engineering, Boone said. The difference is
that Hewlett-Packard is focusing on aerospace and defense
electronics, while IBM's major thrust is in the larger commercial
market.
   KnowledgeWare, Bachman Information Systems Inc. and Index
Technology Corp. will be three of IBM's principal partners in
computer-aided software engineering.

   Manufacturers Hanover Corp. says it expects a
huge loss after a restructuring that includes the addition of $950
million to its loan-loss reserves, a new-stock issue and the sale of
60 percent of its CIT Group financial services unit to Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd. of Japan.
   But the bank holding company, which made the announcement late
Monday, said its plan should significantly improve its capital and
reserve position.
   ``We view this as a very positive endeavor for Manufacturers
Hanover,'' Chairman John F. McGillicuddy told reporters at a news
conference.
   Manufacturers Hanover, the nation's seventh largest bank,
estimated it would suffer a loss of about $775 million for the third
quarter and $475 million for all of 1989.
   For the first six months of this year Manufacturers Hanover's
profit was down 62 pecent to $209 million, or $3.70 a share, from
the year-earlier period. The 1988 period included about $388 million
in one-time gains from divestitures and tax benefits.
   Manufacturers Hanover said Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the world's largest
bank with assets of $410 billion, agreed to pay $1.28 billion for
the 60 percent stake in CIT. The transaction is the largest purchase
of a U.S. company by a Japanese bank.
   Yuko Oana, a senior managing director of Dai-Ichi, said today
that the investment in CIT allows his bank to offer more services
globally and to expand its customer base to include more medium-size
companies in the United States.
   ``CIT, with its comprehensive range of asset-backed financing
products, will enable us to offer a considerably broader product
line to our customers around the world,'' Oana told a news
conference.
   ``At the same time, we believe that CIT will benefit from the
international exposure and perspective that DKB can provide.''
   Monday's announcements came after the stock market closed. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Manufacturers
Hanover closed up 87{ cents at $41.75 a share Monday. In
late-morning trading today, its shares rose $1 to $42.75.
   Analysts said they weren't surprised by the moves. Manufacturers
Hanover had been coming under increasing pressure to raise capital
and increase reserves for losses on loans to less-developed
countries.
   The addition of $950 million in loan-loss provisions in the third
quarter boosts Manufacturers Hanover's loan-loss reserve to $2.4
billion, or 36 percent of its portfolio of medium- to long-term
loans, up from reserves of $1.5 billion, or 22 percent of its loans.
   On average, other big money center banks have reserves equal to
about 30 percent of their loans to less-developed countries.
   ``This should take some of the sting of LDC exposure away from
Manufacturers Hanover and give it some room to maneuver, said James
J. McDermott Jr., an analyst with Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods in New
York. ``I think it was a necessary step.''
   McGillicuddy said recent debt negotiations with Mexico and the
U.S. government's plan for reducing the $1.3 trillion Third World
debt, known as the Brady plan, could make it harder for banks to
collect on outstanding loans.
   Manufacturers Hanover said it would issue up to $500 million in
new common stock before year's end. Analysts said the stock sale
coupled with the sale of a controlling stake in CIT should provide
the bank with much-needed capital to handle its Third World debt
problem.
   CIT is the biggest bank-affiliated finance company in the United
States, withassets of $9.7 billion and $120 million in earnings last
year. It provides loans and leases to medium-sized companies through
50 offices nationwide. Manufacturers Hanover acquired the business
from RCA Corp. in 1984 for $1.5 billion.
   The deal also includes a private placement with Dai-Ichi of 2.7
million in newly issued common shares of Manufacturers Hanover at
$45 a share for a total of $120 million. Dai-Ichi promised not to
acquire more than that 4.9 percent stake over a 10-year period.
   The sale of CIT to Dai-Ichi, which had been rumored for days, is
the latest in a series of divestitures in which Manufacturers
Hanover has raised cash to bolster its capital. Last year it earned
about $400 million from the sale of assets.

<TEXT>
   A California dial-a-porn company whose
sexually-oriented messages were called repeatedly by a 16-year-old
boy will have to pay a $600,000 fine under a Federal Communications
Commission order.
   The commission, in affirming a 1988 preliminary ruling against
Intercambio of San Jose, Calif., said Monday the company had not
prevented minors from listening to the adult material and had not
prevented interstate telephone calls.
   The commission's investigation ``found the evidence conclusive
that Intercambio's messages were obscene and that it had in fact
operated and was continuing to operate in violation of'' the law,
the FCC said.
   Interstate dial-a-porn calls to minors are banned under federal
law.
   The commission gave Intercambio 30 days to pay the fine or face
criminal action.
   The FCC said the complaint that prompted the investigation came
in 1987 from a woman who said her 16-year-old son was dialing the
phone service.
   According to a commission report, the mother said her son placed
more than 280 calls to various dial-a-porn numbers during a 2{-month
period and was seeing a psychiatrist. The commission said the boy
listened to Intercambio's messages six times between July and
September 1987.
   In its defense, the company told the FCC its service was intended
only for California and it had attempted to restrict access to
minors. The company also said the law and FCC rules on pornographic
phone messages were unconstitutional.
   But it did not provide evidence to back up its claims, according
to Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis.
   There was no phone number listed for Intercambio in San Jose and
attempts to locate a number for Intercambio's president, Dan
Glassoff, were unsuccessful Monday.
   Congress last year attempted to wipe out the dial-a-porn industry
by outlawing the sale of indecent phone messages. But the Supreme
Court in June said only obscene material _ patently offensive,
sexual and without redeeming value _ may be banned.
   Congress acted because of complaints from outraged parents who
incurred heavy phone bills from children dialing the 976 numbers
associated with sexually-oriented material.
   But the Supreme Court said recent technological advances assured
children could be kept out the reach of dial-a-porn services and the
government had no compelling reason to ban such calls for adults.
   The $600,000 fine was the same as one the FCC assessed another
California company last year for transmitting obscene phone
messages. But Mary Beth Hess, chief of the FCC's enforcement
division, said Monday that Audio Enterprises of Mill Valley, Calif.,
paid a $50,000 fine and agreed to stop selling sexual phone messages
while admitting no liability.
   A third company, 2001 Enterprises of Reseda, Calif., has also
agreed to stop its sexually-oriented message business after paying
the government $25,000, Hess said.

<HEAD>Cuts Earnings Forecast Due to Soft Sales, Strong Dollar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cosmetics maker Avon Products Inc., pursued
earlier this year by several unwanted suitors, Tuesday disclosed it
has lowered 1989 income expectations due to weakening sales and a
strong dollar.
   This year's after-tax earnings per share are now forecast at
about $1.95 to $2.15, down from an earlier estimated range of $2.30
to $2.40. Earnings in 1990 will be an unspecified amount below the
previously projected $3.35 to $3.45 a share, Avon said.
   Last year, Avon lost $404.5 million, or $6.79 a share, reflecting
a loss from discontinued operations.
   ``In the United States, our new products, but especially our new
gifts and jewelry products, are falling behind sales expectations,''
said James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``In the fourth quarter, non-cosmetic products account for about
50 percent of sales, so that a shortfall in these categories has a
disproportionate impact on the company's performance,'' Preston said
in a news release.
   The dollar's strength is ``contributing materially to the
shortfall,'' Preston said.
   The beauty products manufacturer has been under pressure to
enhance profitability in the aftermath of unsolicited takeover
proposals that Avon's board rejected.
   Avon over the summer received a $41-a-share, or $2.85 billion,
takeover bid from investor Irwin Jacobs. The Jacobs' offer topped an
earlier proposal from Avon's rival direct seller Amway Corp., which
had proposed acquiring Avon for $39 a share, or about $2.1 billion.
   Avon also shunned takeover advances from Mary Kay Corp., parent
of the door-to-door cosmetics company.
   Under Preston, Avon's management repeatedly has said the company
is better off remaining independent, free to carry out plans aimed
at improving the balance sheet.
   Preston said Tuesday that Avon still is committed to the strategy
outlined at a meeting with financial analysts May 19 and that the
company is achieving many elements of the strategy.
   Avon recently said it is considering the sale of its retail
fragrance subsidiaries, Giorgio Beverly Hills and Parfums Stern.
Preston said the revised earnings projections don't include the
effect of a potential sale of the perfume businesses.

<HEAD>UAL Non-Union Workers Face 10 Percent Pay Cut: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of United Airlines' 24,000 non-union
employees face a 10 percent pay cut if the $6.75 billion employee
buyout of parent UAL Corp. goes through as planned, a newspaper
reported today.
   The Chicago Sun-Times, quoting an unidentifed adviser to the
buyout group, said the pay cut would apply to managers and most
salaried workers.
   The lowest-paid clerical workers will not be affected, nor will
employees in one or two fields requiring highly specialized skills
and training since those workers could easily find comparable jobs
with another airline, the newspaper said.
   UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins declined comment on the report. The
United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association, which is
spearheading the buyout effort, said it could not immediately
confirm the story.
   UAL's board of directors accepted the pilot-led, $300-per-share
takeover offer on Thursday, rejecting a competing offer from Los
Angeles investor Marvin Davis.
   The plan, which would make UAL the biggest employee-owned U.S.
company, calls for employees to own 75 percent with management
owning 10 percent and British Airways PLC holding 15 percent.
   The pilots earlier revealed that they would take pay cuts of up
10 percent as part of the buyout plan.
   United's flight attendants are considering management-proposed
contract concessions in exchange for their participation in the
buyout.

   The stock market was slightly higher in moderate
trading today after the government released new economic reports
that pointed to a lowering of inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 3.80 points at
2,691.30 at 11 a.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was up 1.90 points
an hour earlier.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 649 issues up, 504 down and 533 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 47.11 million shares.
   The government reported today that consumer prices remained
unchanged in August, the best inflation performance in more than
three years.
   The Commerce Department also reported that housing construction
fell 5 percent in August, the largest decline in six months. New
homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.35 million units, down from 1.42 million units in July.
   Wall Street analysts said the numbers were below expectations and
good news for the stock market because they suggested an easing of
inflation, adding to hopes that the Federal Reserve will loosen
monetary policy by lowering interest rates.
   Nevertheless, many big institutional investors stayed were on the
sidelines, remaining cautious about the viability of the junk-bond
market after last week's sharp declines, analysts said.
   ``You don't get the sense that we're out of the woods yet after
gains in the last two days,'' said Larry Wachtel, vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``There's a sense of caution
prevailing.''
   Despite steep declines over the last two weeks, some observers
warned that the stock market is in for still further weakness.
   ``We expect some sort of correction over the next two weeks,''
said Brad Weeks, head of equity trading for the investment firm of
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.53 to 192.96.

   A former employee of defense contractor
Martin Marietta has been arrested and charged with providing inside
information to a welding company bidding on contracts.
   George H. McDowell, 62, bilked the company of thousands of
dollars through a kickback scheme with Wynn's Welding Inc. of
Orlando, said federal authorities.
   ``We uncovered it, investigated it internally and turned it over
to federal authorities,'' said Martin spokesman Chip Manor on Monday.
   The case is the second alleged kickback scheme Martin has faced
in less than two months. On Aug. 9, a former Martin employment
administrator was indicted in Orlando on charges of defrauding the
company of more than $55,000 in an operation involving employment
agencies in New York and Phoenix, Ariz.
   The U.S. Attorney's office is continuing the investigation into
the McDowell case, said prosecutor Gary Librick, and other charges
may be filed.
   McDowell, charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, could not
be reached for comment.
   The alleged scheme took place from Jan. 16, 1987, to Sept. 11,
1987, according to court documents.

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop today denounced
efforts to export U.S. cigarettes as ``the height of hypocrisy.''
   Koop, who is retiring Oct. 1, testified at a hearing of the U.S.
trade representative against a request by the cigarette industry for
government intervention to force Thailand to allow sales and
advertising of American cigarettes.
   ``When we are persuading foreign governments to stop the flow of
cocaine, it is the height of hypocrisy to export tobacco,'' said
Koop, who has conducted a vigorous anti-smoking campaign throughout
his tenure.
   The U.S. Cigarette Export Association has requested the
intervention and the trade representative is to decide the issue by
next May.
   In 1988, U.S. tobacco exports contributed a record $3.5 billion
to helping reduce ``this country's onerous trade deficit,'' said
export association President Owen Smith.
   ``People throughout Asia will continue to buy and smoke billions
of cigarettes each year with or without U.S. presence in the
marketplace,'' said Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C. ``The real issue is
whether American companies will be allowed to compete, or if the
playing field will be abandoned to other foreign manufacturers and
local monopolies.''
   But Rep. Chester A. Atkins, D-Mass., said the real issue ``is
about the American government using leverage and tax dollars to
coerce countries into allowing marketing practices that were
outlawed long ago'' in the United States.
   The petition seeks to force Thailand ``to overturn a policy of
banning cigarette advertisements'' in print and broadcast media,
Atkins said.
   The export association represents three major cigarette
companies, Brown and Williamson, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds.
   Since 1986, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have opened markets to
U.S. cigarette brands after being accused of unfair trade and
threatened with retaliation against their products.
   ``I believe that most Americans would be appalled to learn that
their government, which banned cigarette advertisements on TV,
required warning labels on cigarettes ... is aggressively pushing
cigarette addiction overseas through the trade representative,''
Atkins said.
   ``It is simply inexcusable for the U.S. to exert its great
influence to force Thailand to reverse its health policy,'' he said.
   Atkins is sponsoring legislation to require that U.S. cigarette
brands sold abroad carry warnings and advertising restrictions
equivalent to those in the United States.
   The industry argues that foreign countries are competent to make
their own regulations.

   The U.S. dollar ended weaker in European trading
Tuesday after the Federal Reserve Bank intervened to keep the
currency down.
   Gold prices also waned.
   The dollar was quoted late in the day at 1.9505 Deutsche marks,
down from 1.9525 marks late Monday in London.
   The dollar ended the European trading day at 145.55 yen. That
came after a fall of 0.70 yen in trading in Tokyo, where the dollar
closed at 145.73 yen.
   Dealers said trading was fairly thin and inactive because many
market players remain skittish about jumping back in after Friday'
sharp slide from over 2.00 marks to 1.9350 marks.
   ``People don't have much of a medium-term view about the dollar

   Gold traded in London at $360.50 a troy ounce late Tuesday, down

   In Hong Kong, gold rose 0.86 cents to close at a bid $360.90.

   Financially crippled Campeau Corp. today secured
an emergency loan that will enable its department stores to pay
debts but force the company's founder Robert Campeau to relinquish
control.
   Campeau's problems, caused largely by obligations on its ``junk
bond'' debts, had raised doubts about the future of his company and
injected uncertainty into the $200 billion market in junk bonds,
which are high-yield, high-risk securities used to finance takeovers
and expansion.
   Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., which is providing the $250
million loan, also obtained the power to steer Campeau through a
major financial overhaul.
   Olympia &amp; York, owned by Toronto's Reichmann brothers, will be
given three seats on a new 10-member Campeau board and the right to
buy almost 16 million shares of the Canadian retail and property
holding company.
   The first portion of the loan from Olympia &amp; York became
available immediately, Campeau said in an announcement released by
its Toronto headquarters.
   The agreement calls for up to $150 million to be channeled to
Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. and the remainder to its
Allied Stores Corp. division.
   The money will allow the department store operators to meet
interest payments now due on debts and to pay suppliers shipping
merchandise ahead of the crucial Christmas shopping season.
   Under the definitive agreement with Olympia &amp; York, a new board
of directors was appointed. The configuration of the board reflects
the amount of power that Chairman Robert Campeau relinguished in the
company he built.
   Three members of the new board come from the Campeau group, three
from Olympia &amp; York and four represent minority shareholders.
   The board formed a restructuring committee headed by one of the
three Reichmann-appointed members of the board, Lionel Dodd. The
committee intends to hire the investment banking firm Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. to help develop a restructuring plan and retail business
consultants from McKinsey &amp; Co. also will be engaged.
   Robert Campeau, who retained the titles of chairman and chief
executive officer, said the company's U.S. arm will employ a chief
executive officer and chief financial officer whose main mission
will be to supervise the restructuring of Campeau's retail
operations in the United States.
   The two new executives, who have yet to be selected, will report
directly to the board and the restructuring committee.
   Part of the restructuring includes the sale of the 17-store
Bloomingdale's chain, which is part of Federated.
   Olympia &amp; York will use its ``best efforts'' to arrange temporary
financing of about $800 million until Campeau can arrange for the
sale of New York-based Bloomingdale's. Olympia &amp; York has agreed to
put up some of the bridge loan, if necessary.
   For coming to Campeau's rescue, Olympia &amp; York will receive
warrants entitling it to purchase up to 15.625 million ordinary
Campeau shares at $16 a piece until Sept. 18, 1991.
   Added to its current 24.5 percent stake in Campeau, the purchase
of 16 million additional shares would raise Olympia &amp; York's
interest in Campeau to 38.4 percent, on a fully diluted basis.
Robert Campeau's stake would be cut to 43.2 percent from about 54
percent, under the agreement.
   Campeau common stock last traded at $13.50 Canadian dollars
before it was halted last Wednesday, after trading as high as $22.25
a few days earlier.
   Commenting on the deal with Olympia &amp; York, Robert Campeau said
after reviewing projected cash flow requirements and the financial
position of Campeau and its subsidiaries, he determined that a major
restructuring was needed to reduce leverage.
   ``At my request, Olympia &amp; York has agreed to substantially
increase its investment in Campeau and to be primarily responsible
for the refinancing and restructuring,'' Campeau said. ``The
significant experience and expertise of the Olympia &amp; York
organization will greatly assist in the endeavor.''

   Housing construction, depressed by a spike in
mortgage rates, fell by 5 percent in August, the government said
Tuesday in a report many analysts viewed as only a temporary setback
for the housing industry.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million units last
month, down from 1.42 million units in July.
   It was the first decline since May and the largest setback since
a 12.7 percent fall last February. Housing starts had risen 1.3
percent in July and 7.5 percent in June.
   Fixed mortgage rates, which peaked at 11.22 percent in March, had
fallen to 9.68 percent by Aug. 4, but then rose by about one-half
percentage point through August.
   However, in recent weeks they have begun edging down slightly,
now standing at 10.05 percent, according to the weekly survey by the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Economists predicted continued
small declines in mortgage rates for the rest of the year and said
this should bolster sales and construction figures.
   ``The (August) housing starts numbers show builders were waiting
out the recent uptick in interest rates,'' said John Tuccillo, chief
economist of the National Association of Realtors. ``However, the
higher rate of building permits is a good sign that the stalled
activity in August is only temporary.''
   Overall applications for building permits, considered a good
barometer of future activity, rose 3.5 percent after falling 2.1
percent in July.
   David Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of
Home Builders, said the drop in construction and another report
Tuesday showing consumer prices did not rise in August should
convince the Federal Reserve to stop fighting inflation and resume
lowering interest rates to bolster the economy.
   However, other economists said they doubted that the weak
construction number would prompt action on the part of the Fed,
given the fact that other statistics show the economy is continuing
to grow at a healthy rate.
   ``I don't think the Fed will do anything to change policy for the
next several months,'' said David Berson, chief economist of the
Federal National Mortgage Association.
   Richard Peach, senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers
Association, said he believed that interest rates will fall despite
Fed intervention as financial market fears about inflation ease.
   Construction starts fell earlier this year for four straight
months before rebounding in June, the longest string of declines
since activity slowed for five months in a row from February through
June 1987. The May level of 1.31 million starts was the slowest pace
since the 1.30 million rate in December 1982.
   Total housing starts during the first eight months of the year
are down 4.7 percent from the same period of 1988.
   Construction of single-family homes last month fell 2.5 percent
to an annual rate of 1 million units. Single-family starts had risen
5.9 percent in July after falling 0.5 percent in June.
   Apartment construction fell 11.4 percent in August to an annual
rate of 350,000 units. It had fallen 9 percent in July after rising
31.1 percent in June.

   Stock prices were moderately lower Tuesday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 12.3
points, or 0.5 percent, lower at 2361.5, nearly 10 points above a
session low of 2351.4 and off the intraday high of 2379.4.
   Volume was 393.5 million shares, up from 310.2 million Monday.
   Dealers said market makers were active in liquidating holdings in
a broad array of shares, positions they had built up in recent weeks
anticipating the stock index would test its all-time high of 2443.4.
   A late announcement by Ford Motor Co. that it may bid for a
friendly stake in Jaguar PLC injected some fresh confidence into
what has largely been a takeover-driven market, dealers said.
   But the market didn't react aggressively outside of bidding
Jaguar shares up 62 pence to close at 467 pence, or $7.33.

   What do you give to the man who REALLY has
everything?
   In billionaire developer Donald Trump's case, it's his own
television program _ ``Trump Card,'' a game show set to debut next
year.
   ``I think it will be tremendously successful. We're trading on
the glamour of the Trump Castle, the Trump Princess,'' Trump said
Tuesday at a news conference _ in the Trump Tower _ announcing the
show.
   ``The Trump name has never been hotter,'' he said, mentioning
(repeatedly) the successes of his Trump Shuttle, his Trump Plaza and
Trump Castle casinos, and his book ``Trump: The Art of the Deal.''
He also produced Miss America 1990 Debbye Turner to say a few nice
things about him.
   Trump said his share of the profits on the show _ which he
estimated could be in the millions of dollars _ will go to charity.
   The show, which will be syndicated and air Monday through Friday,
is based on a top-rated British game show called ``Full House,''
Lorimar Television President David E. Salzman said.
   Lorimar developed the program, which will be distributed through
Warner Bros. Trump said he decided to proceed with the idea after
getting a one-on-one sales pitch from a Lorimar executive he
accidentally encountered on one of his helicopters.
   ``This idea stopped us in our tracks,'' said Dick Robertson,
Warner Bros. president for domestic television distribution. ``It's
the best single new idea we'd seen in years.''
   The show, to be filmed at the Trump Castle Hotel and Casino in
Atlantic City, N.J., will feature three contestants trying to answer
questions and thereby filling in their ``Trump Card'' _ a box of 15
squares. Prize money for the winners has not yet been determined,
Salzman said.
   The show's host has not been named yet either, although Trump
ruled out casino competitor and game show producer Merv Griffin.
   ``Merv is a friend of mine. Merv is a good guy. He has good game
shows. I just happen to have better casinos,'' said Trump.

<HEAD>IBM Promises 20,000 Experts to Help With Software Engineering</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   International Business Machines Corp. said
Tuesday it would make 20,000 experts available worldwide to help its
customers adapt to the coming era of software engineering.
   The statement came as IBM announced, as expected, that it was
committing itself to computer-aided software engineering, or CASE.
IBM's endorsement is expected to give a large boost to the high-tech
field, which already garners about $300 million in annual revenue.
   Software engineering is intended to replace disorganized methods
of software-writing that have led to chaotic, unmanageable and
failure-prone programs for large computers.
   Consultants said IBM's promise of experts to help customers was
an important part of the announcement, since the transition to
software engineering promises to be a real test of programmers'
flexibility.
   ``The limiting factor on the introduction of CASE technology is
the ability of information systems shops to cope with a radically
new culture. It is going to take them quite some years,'' said Ian
Palmer, chairman of James Martin Associates in Reston, Va.
   ``It's going to require an investment, not just of the company's
time but of a person's ability to recycle themselves, re-engineer
themselves,'' said Dick Welsh, the Dallas-based director of
information systems consulting markets for Ernst &amp; Young.
   Some of the 20,000 experts will come from IBM and some from four
outside firms designated by IBM: CAP Gemini America, Computer Power
Group, Computer Task Group and GE Consulting.
   IBM is calling its offering AD-Cycle. Its strategy relies heavily
on existing software-development tools marketed by other companies
that beat IBM to the market, particularly KnowledgeWare Inc.,
Bachman Information Systems Inc. and Index Technology Inc.
   More than 30 companies on Tuesday announced their support for
IBM's plan, which will roll out over the next several years.
   This may be the farthest IBM has ever gone in using other
companies' products as a central part of its own strategy, said
George Conrades, an IBM senior vice president. ``It's a high-water
mark, but it's an ever-rising tide,'' he said in an interview.

   The stock market was narrowly higher in afternoon
trading after getting a lift early in the day from new economic
reports that pointed to an easing of inflationary pressures.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 3.80 points to
2,691.30 at 2 p.m. EDT after rising more than 10 points in
late-morning trading.
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 691 issues up, 661 down and 554 unchanged.
Transportation and pharmaceutical stocks were some of the few
standouts in an otherwise featureless session, traders said.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 97.22 million shares.
   The government reported today that consumer prices remained
unchanged in August, the best inflation performance in more than
three years. Prices were up a modest 0.2 percent in both June and
July.
   The Commerce Department also reported that housing construction
fell 5 percent in August, the largest decline in six months. New
homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.35 million units, down from 1.42 million units in July.
   Wall Street analysts said the numbers were below expectations and
good news for the stock market because they suggested an easing of
inflation and added to hopes that the Federal Reserve will loosen
monetary policy by lowering interest rates.
   Although institutional trading was light, some selling by big
investors early in the afternoon wiped out some of the market's
earlier gains. The junk bond market rallied after Campeau Corp.
announced that it had secured a $250 million loan to pay its
creditors.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was up
0.17 to 192.60.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index had dipped
0.30 to 379.20.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, Manufacturers Hanover
was up 2\ at 44 after Monday's announcement that it had agreed to
sell a stake in the company to Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in an
effort to improve its capital position.
   UAL Corp. was up 2{ to 284, Upjohn had gained \ to 36| and Pfizer
had advanced | to 68].
   Meanwhile, Avon was down 2 to 31~, Detroit Edison was off \ to
21\ and McDonalds had slipped \ to 30\.
   Campeau, the Canadian retail giant whose heavy junk-bond debt led
to sharp declines in those high-yield, high-risk securities, resumed
trading in the over-the-counter market after being halted since last
Wednesday. In early afternoon dealings, Campeau was quoted at 12[,

<HEAD>Disney Suing Over Tax Bill: $12,000 or $1.4 Million?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney World Co. is challenging a 254
percent property tax increase county officials say was levied to
help pay for huge commercial growth and traffic problems near the
tourist attraction.
   Disney on Monday paid Osceola County $12,000, the company's own
estimate of 1989 property taxes owed. The county plans to bill
Disney for $1.4 million.
   Disney spokesman Charlie Ridgway said Tuesday the company filed a
lawsuit in state circuit court ``to protect our rights to challenge,
although we hope to come to an agreement with county authorities on
the whole subject.''
   Osceola removed the agricultural classification on most of
Disney's undeveloped property in the county and jacked up the tax
bill to $1.4 million. Disney's theme park is located north of the
area, in Orlando in Orange County.
   Disney filed the lawsuit Friday to beat a Monday deadline on
challenges to tax assessments.
   A Disney representative on Monday dropped off checks totaling
$12,012 _ the company's ``good-faith estimate'' of its 1989 taxes.
   ``It's kind of like they're thumbing their nose at us, isn't
it?'' Osceola Property Appraiser Bob Day said. ``I mean $12,000 vs.
$1.4 million. There's a big difference there, wouldn't you say?''
   Until this year, much of Disney's 7,013 acres of undeveloped
property was classified as agricultural because Disney leased a
portion to a cattle rancher and contracted with a timber company to
harvest pine trees.
   The property was assessed at $26.9 million last year, and the
company paid Osceola $395,000 in taxes. After removing the
agricultural exemption, Day in July reassessed the land at $84
million.
   Disney contends even last year's taxes were excessive because the
1988 payment was based on a commercial classification for part of
the property, as well as on the portion classified agricultural.
   Disney's estimated payment Monday represents the total amount of
1989 taxes the company believes it owes because ``all of that land
rightfully should be classified as agricultural,'' Ridgway said.
   ``Under the law, you pay what you feel you should properly pay,''
he said.
   By contrast, Disney paid its other host county, Orange, $24
million in taxes last year and is expected to pay $33.65 million
this year.
   Much of the company's Orange County property contain's its
prosperous tourist attractions. In recent years, Disney has built
the Disney-MGM Studios park, Pleasure Island and Typhoon Lagoon next
in Orange near the Osceola land.
   But Osceola Commissioner Larry Whaley said: ``We have just as
many problems from Disney as Orange County does. And they're getting
$33 million in taxes.''
   Osceola in 1973 tried to strip Disney of its agricultural
classification but Disney won a legal battle. But the tourist
attraction has grown since then, county officials argue, and have
had a greater impact on the county.

   Apple Computer Inc.'s first portable Macintosh
computer is more expensive, bigger and heavier than the latest
generation of laptops but the company said Tuesday it makes no
compromises on features.
   Apple hopes to offset the drawbacks of its Macintosh Portable by
giving users all the power and features they would get on a
full-size Macintosh.
   ``It's a Macintosh through and through. Now our customers can
have Macintosh personal computing anywhere,'' Jean-Louis Gassee,
president of Apple Products, said in a statement.
   Analysts have been lukewarm toward Apple's first portable.
   ``I think it'll do well with Apple's existing customer base. I'm
not sure it'll gain share in the overall laptop market, though,''
said Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst at Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San
Francisco. ``It's a little little big and it's also a little
pricey.''
   The portable lists at $5,799, or $6,499 with an optional
40-megabyte hard disk for data storage. A modem for communication
over phone lines is extra at $449. The weight is 13.7 pounds, or
15.7 pounds with the optional 40-megabyte hard disk.
   The screen is one-tone rather than color, but is unusually sharp
because there is a separate transistor for each screen dot, or
picture element. The screen contains more than 250,000 picture
elements in a 640 by 400 array, making it 50 percent larger than the
screen on a Macintosh SE.
   To conserve batteries, Apple used a version of the Motorola 68000
processor chip that requires 80 percent less power. It also used a
low-power kind of memory chip. The lead acid batteries last from six
to 12 hours and can be recharged to capacity at any time, Apple said.
   Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., also announced the Macintosh
IIci, an advanced version of the Macintosh IIcx, which it billed as
``the most powerful Macintosh that Apple has ever developed.''
   The Macintosh IIci starts at $6,269 and ranges up to $9,152,
putting it in the price range of some computer workstations,
machines designed for scientists and engineers. Apple said it
delivers 55 percent higher performance than the Macintosh IIcx or
IIx. It has built-in video capabilities.

<HEAD>Ford Purchasing Up to 15 Percent of Jaguar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. announced plans Tuesday to buy up to
15 percent of Jaguar PLC, saying it wanted a long-term relationship
with the unprofitable British luxury auto maker.
   Jaguar, which has been battered by flagging sales in its
principal U.S. market during the past year, maintained that it
wanted to remain independent but didn't rule out collaborating with
another car company.
   Ford, which already has a huge European presence and is
negotiating a possible transaction with Swedish automaker Saab,
could benefit from an association with the well-known Jaguar luxury
car line, analysts said.
   Jaguar stock soared 97 cents to close at $7.33 a share on
London's Stock Exchange, as some speculated that other companies
also might be assembling stakes in Jaguar.
   Jaguar's articles of association limit individual shareholdings
to 15 percent until the end of 1990, and the government has veto
power over any takeover through the same period.
   ``It has always been our desire to maintain our independence,''
said Jaguar spokesman, who wasn't identified in keeping with company
policy. However, the spokesman also said Jaguar has held out the
possibility of collaborating with another car maker.
   The spokesman said the Coventry-based company was notified of
Ford's plans on Tuesday and that Jaguar wouldn't make any final
comment until its board of directors had a chance to discuss them at
an unspecified date.
   Ford of Europe Chairman Lindsey Halstead, speaking at a London
news conference, said his company's intentions are not hostile. He
characterized contact with Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan on Tuesday
as ``friendly and open and we agreed to leave the lines of
communication open.''
   The two companies held private, informal talks last year which
failed to produce any sort of working agreement, Halstead said.
   Ford has informed the British government of its plans but has not
gotten a reaction from British officials, said Ford spokesman
Michael Perry.
   The spokesman said: ``It is too early to say what might happen
then (1990), but we regard the acquisition of a minority
shareholding in Jaguar as a basis for a longer-term strategic
association between our two companies as we explained to John Egan
in private discussion.''
   Perry also said Ford respected Jaguar's distinctive British
character and would want to maintain its separate identity and help
strengthen its image.
   Last Wednesday, Jaguar posted an after-tax loss of $1.7 million
on sales of $870 million for the first six months of the year.
   The company expects to sell 20,000 cars in the United States this
year, down from 20,700 in 1988.
   Ford of Europe, which is headquartered in Brentwood, England,
makes 1.8 million vehicles a year. It has 21 European plants, 11 of
them in Britain, and employs more than110,000 people.
   Parent Ford Motor Co. is the second largest U.S. automaker behind
General Motors Corp. Ford posted an industry record profit of $5.3
billion, or $10.96 a share, on revenue of $92.45 billion in 1988.
   Ford confirmed earlier this month that it was negotiating with
Saab-Scania AB, the Swedish airplane, truck and automaker, over a
possible transaction.
   Peter Caldwell, automotive analyst at Smith New Court PLC, said
Ford may have made its move now because it believed Jaguar's share
price was headed higher, or because it wanted to preempt a move by
another auto maker.
   David Blackwood, an automotive analyst at the London investment
firm Hoare Govett Ltd., said he would not be surprised if other
automakers also were buying Jaguar stakes.
   Although Jaguar is losing money, its brand name is highly
valuable, the analysts said.
   Halstead said Jaguar could benefit from Ford's European
production and marketing. Jaguar could benefit from economies of
scale in parts and materials purchasing, as well as from Ford's
engineering research.
   Ford spokesman Perry said the company has begun buying Jaguar
shares on the open market, but he declined to elaborate on Ford's
purchases.
   Under U.S. antitrust law Ford must notify the government once it
acquiresa $15 million worth of Jaguar stock, about a 1.2 percent
stake, and then would have to wait 30 days before buying more.

<TEXT>
   Soybeans for spot delivery on the Chicago Board of
Trade dropped to a 22-month low Tuesday as traders liquidated their
holdings for September delivery ahead of the contract's expiration
on Wednesday.
   Other soybean contracts closed mostly higher while most corn and
wheat futures retreated amid increased corn-harvesting activity and
slack export demand for U.S. grains.
   Aside from the drop in the September soybean contract to $5.63
per bushel, the lowest near-month delivery price since Nov. 16,
1987, the markets held up well in the face of the advancing harvest
and forecasts for weather beneficial to the corn and soybean crops.
   ``The market is still pretty resilient,'' said Ted Mao, a grain
specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The Agriculture Department reported late Monday that 6 percent of
the corn crop had been harvested in the 17 largest corn-growing
states as of Sunday while 1 percent of the soybean crop had been cut
in the top 19 soybean states.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 1} cents lower with
the September contract at $3.80{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower

<HEAD>UAL Non-Union Workers Said To Face 10 Percent Pay Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of United Airlines' 24,000 nonunion workers
face a 10 percent pay cut if the $6.75 billion employee buyout of
parent UAL Corp. goes through as planned, according to a published
report Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, United pilots, who are spearheading the takeover
effort, demonstrated their good faith by flying the airline's new
Boeing 747-400 jets, something they had refused to do since June due
to a labor dispute.
   Quoting an unidentifed adviser to the buyout group, the Chicago
Sun-Times said the 10 percent pay cut would apply to managers and
most other salaried workers.
   The lowest-paid clerical workers would not be affected, nor would
employees in one or two fields requiring highly specialized skills
and training, since those workers could easily find comparable jobs
with other airlines, the newspaper said.
   UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins declined to comment on the report.
   Hank Krakowski, a spokesman for the United chapter of the Air
Line Pilots Association, said he could not confirm the story.
   ``That's between UAL management and those workers,'' Krakowski
said. ``We don't have any say about how that's going to come down.''
   The pilots' union revealed last week that United's 7,000 pilots
would take pay cuts of up to 10 percent as part of the $300-a-share
buyout plan accepted last Thursday by UAL's board of directors.
   The plan calls for UAL workers to own 75 percent of the company
with management owning 10 percent and British Airways PLC 15
percent. UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and John C. Pope, UAL's chief
financial officer, would continue to run the company for the new
employee-owners.
   Leaders of the United chapter of the Association of Flight
Attendants were meeting in Denver to discuss management-proposed
contract concessions that would enable them to participate in
ownership of the nation's second-largest airline.
   United's largest union, the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, opposed the buyout.
   United's pilots, the only worker group committed so far to the
buyout plan, began flying the airline's new fuel-efficient 747-400s
on Monday with nonstop service from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia.
   The pilots had refused to fly the long-range aircraft, which
began arriving in June, because of a dispute over staffing
requirements.
   The pilots, who have been without a contract for 17 months, had
agreed to begin flying the jets if UAL's board accepted their buyout
bid. The agreement calls for two pilots on flights of up to eight
hours, three on flights of more than eight hours and four on flights
of more than 12 hours, Krakowski said.
   The pilots will implement another term of the agreement in
November when their maximum workload goes to 85 flight hours a month
from 81 with no increase in pay, he said.

   A late bout of selling sent stock prices tumbling
just before the closing bell despite good news on the inflation
front that had kept prices firmer during much of the session.
   The market opened higher after two new economic reports suggested
that inflationary pressures had eased further during August. But
while blue-chip stocks gained, the broader market lagged behind,
traders said.
   The Labor Department reported that consumer prices remained
unchanged in August as measured by its Consumer Price Index. It was
the best inflation performance in more than three years. Prices were
up a modest 0.2 percent in both June and July.
   The Commerce Department also reported that housing construction
fell 5 percent in August, the largest decline in six months. New
homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.35 million units, down from 1.42 million units in July.
   Wall Street analysts said the data suggested an easing of
inflationary pressures and added to hopes that the Federal Reserve
will loosen monetary policy by lowering interest rates.
   Although institutional trading was light, selling by institutions
early in the afternoon wiped out some of the market's earlier gains.
The market showed some confidence after a rally in the junk bond
market following Canadian retail giant Campeau Corp.'s announcement
that it had secured a $250 million loan to pay its creditors.
   Junk bond prices had fallen sharply in recent sessions after word
of Campeau's financial troubles raised concern about the viability
of the high-yield, high-risk securities. Campeau had used junk bonds
to finance recent acquisitions.
   But late in the day, stocks retreated under pressure of a late
bout of computer-driven program selling. Transportation and
pharmaceutical stocks were among the few standouts in an otherwise
featureless session, traders said.

<HEAD>ZZZZ Best Official Ordered to Repay Profits, Gets Triple Penalties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former ZZZZ Best Co. official was ordered to
return profits he made by trading stock in the rug-shampooing firm
founded by Barry M. Minkow, who was convicted of defrauding
investors in a company-wide scam.
   Jerry Polevoi, 41, of Simi Valley also was ordered Monday to pay
$675,000 in civil penalties by U.S. District Judge Robert H.
Kelleher.
   Kelleher told Polevoi to refrain from violating securities laws,
the same order he issued last month to Polevoi's brother, Jack, who
also was involved in the ZZZZ Best scam.
   The brothers had ordered 54,200 shares of ZZZZ Best stock ``sold
short'' _ a way of betting a stock price will decline _ in mid-1987,
when they knew Minkow's scams were falling apart but before the
public had a chance to know, prosecutors said.
   The brothers jointly were ordered to repay $224,860.75 in
profits. Each also must pay triple that amount in civil penalties,
or $674.582.25, according to Kelleher's order.
   They already are serving 18-month prison terms for stock fraud
and tax fraud for their role in the ZZZZ Best scandal, which used a
``Ponzi scheme'' style scam in which money from later investors was
used to pay early debts while nearly no work was actually performed
by the company.
   Minkow, who started ZZZZ Best as a teen-ager in his parents'
garage, was convicted of 57 counts of fraud, conspiracy and other
charges, and sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $26
million in restitution and penalties.

   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher
said Tuesday that agreements to generate Polish-American business
and improve tourism will be signed during his visit to Poland.
   Also under way are plans to put retired U.S. executives in Polish
companies to help teach market-oriented management.
   Mosbacher told an audience of Polish and American business
leaders the economic changes in Poland are as impressive as the
political transformations that resulted in the first
non-communist-led government in four decades.
   ``Who would have imagined a short time ago that foreign firms not
only would be able to invest in Poland, but also form 100 percent
foreign-owned enterprises?'' Mosbacher said.
   The commerce secretary met Tuesday with Solidarity Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Foreign Trade Minister Marcin Swiecicki.
   On Wednesday, he said he is to sign an agreement ``to build close
and growing contacts between Polish and American firms and to
generate bilateral business.''
   Also to be formalized is an accord designed to impove tourism and
expand U.S. tourism-related business in Poland, the secretary said.
   No details were provided on either program Tuesday.
   Mosbacher is to see Solidarity leader Lech Walesa in Gdansk on
Wednesday, and witness the formal creation of a joint fishing
venture involving American, Danish and Polish interests.
   Support from the West, including new trade and investment, is
considered key to the success of the Mazowiecki government and its
efforts to reverse Poland's economic crisis.
   Mosbacher is one of the first guests at the new Marriot Hotel
being completed in a long unfinished Warsaw skyscraper. The hotel is
a joint venture with the Polish airlines LOT and is considered a
major test of the potential for American investment in Poland.
   Numerous obstacles face would-be investors, including an
antiquated telephone system and the scarcity of even basic business
supplies such as paper.
   But Beurt Servaas, an Indianoplis publishing executive who heads
the U.S. -Polish Business Council, said his seven years of
investment in Poland leads him to believe there are opportunities.
   ``It cost us some money to get started, and I call that
education,'' he said.
   There are currently only about two dozen joint ventures between
U.S. And Polish companies. Another two dozen U.S. companies have
offices in Poland.

   The dollar turned mixed in nervous worldwide
trading Tuesday amid reports the Federal Reserve intervened to keep
the currency down.
   Gold prices declined.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $361.20 a troy ounce, down 50 cents from late
Monday. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $360 an
ounce, off 70 cents.
   Zlatko Glamuzina, chief dealer at the New York office of Banco di
Sicilia, said reports that the Fed sold small amounts of dollars
added to the tension of an already nervous market after Friday's
sharp decline. Last week's downturn had followed the release of
mixed economic reports and rumors.
   ``We don't really know what the future lies for the dollar,''
Glamuzina said. ``Today it seems more of a wait-and-see attitude ...
where traders didn't feel comfortable unloading long or short
positions.''
   A corporate dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt agreed, ``People
don't have much of a medium-term view about the dollar now.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.70 yen to close at 145.73 yen. The dollar traded
at 145.55 yen in London, and at 145.85 yen in New York, down from
145.93 yen Monday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. The pound firmed
to $1.5720 in London, compared with $1.5695 late Monday. Sterling
fetched $1.5710 in New York, unchanged from late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's
quotes, included: 1.9535 West German marks, up from 1.9523; 1.6905
Swiss francs, up from 1.6840; 6.60105 French francs, up from 6.5830;
1.18455 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18335; and 1,406.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,404.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.6870 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6850; 6.5875 French francs, down from 6.5890;
2.2000 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2180; 1.1833 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.1834; and 1,406.50 Italian lire, down from 1,417.40.
   Gold traded in London at $360.50 an ounce late Tuesday, down from
Monday's $361.65. In Zurich, gold traded at $360.50 an ounce late
Tuesday, down from $361.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 0.86 cents to close at a bid
$360.90.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery fell to $5.061 a troy ounce from $5.063 Monday.
Silver rose in London to $5.09 an ounce, up one cent.

<HEAD>Large Chrysler Cars To Be Rounder in Three Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s new line of boxy
luxury cars will be replaced beginning in 1993 by rounder models,
company executives said Tuesday.
   The comments came as Chrysler introduced its 1990 cars, including
a new Imperial, a nameplate asbent for seven years.
   Chrysler will begin its LH large-and luxury-car program for the
1993 model year, with four-door, front-wheel-drive models.
Manufacturing capability will permit two-door and rear-wheel-drive
models, Chrysler spokesman Tom Kowaleski said.
   Replacements of the company's line of luxury cars are part of
Chrysler's plans, said Tom Pappert, vice president for sales for the
nation's No. 3 automaker.
   Officials said the company planned to offer more rounded luxury
cars in the future. This year, Ford Motor Co. introduced a rounder
Lincoln Town Car.
   When asked if Chrysler planned to sell two styles of large cars,
Pappert, standing about 20 feet from a new Imperial, said, ``I think
we aren't going to keep two.''
   The four-door 1990 Chrysler Imperial revives a nameplate last
seen in the 1983 model year on a two-door model. The last Imperial
four-door was for the 1975 model year.
   Also Tuesday, Dodge Division General Manager J.B. Damoose said
Chrysler likely will build the Viper two-seat sports car for the
1993 model year, although some engineering problems and financial
concerns are lingering.
   The car, to be powered by a V-10 or a V-8 engine with up to 400
horsepower, will sell at less than 5,000 a year, an extremely small
volume. By comparison, Mazda Motor Corp. is speculating that about
40,000 of its two-seat sports car Miata will be sold annually.
   Damoose said the Viper, first unveiled on the auto show circuit
in January, will cost between $25,000 and $30,000. The Miata has a
base price of $13,800.

<HEAD>Spot Soybeans Slump To 22-Month Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybeans for spot delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade fell to
a 22-month low Tuesday on a combination of harvest pressure and
position-evening in the September contract ahead of its expiration
on Wednesday.
   Other soybean contracts closed mostly higher while most corn and
wheat futures retreated amid increased corn harvesting and slack
export demand for U.S. grains.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures were sharply lower;
cocoa futures advanced; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and
precious metals inched lower.
   Soybean futures settled 9\ cents lower to 3 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $5.63 a bushel, the lowest
near-month delivery price since Nov. 16, 1987.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with September at
$3.80 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 2 cents higher with
September at $2.33} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents lower to 1 cent
higher with September at $1.34 a bushel.
   Aside from the drop in the September soybean contract, the
markets held up well in the face of the advancing harvest and
forecasts for continued beneficial crop weather.
   ``The market is still pretty resilient,'' said Ted Mao, a grain
specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   The Agriculture Department reported late Monday that 6 percent of
the corn crop had been harvested in the 17 largest corn-growing
states as of Sunday while 1 percent of the soybean crop had been cut
in the top 19 soybean states.
   Support stemmed from scattered forecasts for freezing
temperatures Sunday night in the Corn Belt. But with the crops at or
rapidly approaching maturity, the danger of significant frost damage
is almost past, Mao said.
   Crude-oil futures fell steeply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, paced by liquidation in the expiring October crude-oil
contract, which goes off the board Wednesday.
   Heating-oil futures also weakened significantly, partly as a
result of mild temperatures in the heavily populated Northeast.
   ``Heating oil is not getting any help from seasonal factors and
supplies seem to be building,'' said Jim Ritterbusch, vice president
of trading and research with Carson Petroleum Co., a Chicago-area
petroleum distributor.
   After the close, the American Petroleum Institute reported that
U.S. stocks of petroleum distillates, including heating oil,
increased by 1.61 million barrels last week. Gasoline stocks rose by
244,000 barrels while crude oil stocks fell 9.61 million barrels.
   Ritterbusch said gasoline futures prices were lightly supported
by fears that Hurricane Hugo could swing into the Gulf Coast,
damaging U.S. oil refineries.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 32 cents
lower with October at $19.56 a barrel; heating oil was .43 cent to
.77 cent lower with October at 54.95 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .34 cent to .50 cent lower with October at 57.67 cents
a gallon.
   Cocoa futures rebounded modestly on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange after tumbling to 14-year lows Monday following the
International Cocoa Organization's failure to repair its battered
price-support mechanism.
   Cocoa settled $9 to $13 higher with December at $1,047 per metric
ton.
   Cattle futures finished mostly lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in the wake of Monday's USDA report showing
lighter-than-expected marketings of cattle off of feed lots last
month.
   Live cattle settled .52 cent lower to .02 cent higher with
October at 71.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .50
cent lower with September at 83.17 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent
lower to .38 cent higher with October at 41.67 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .70 cent to .77 cent lower with February at 47.50
cents a pound.
   Precious-metal futures drifted lower in response to the Labor
Department's report of no change in consumer prices last month. Gold
and silver perform best during times of rising inflation.
   Gold futures settled 30 cents to 60 cents lower with September at
$361.20 a troy ounce; silver was 0.1 cent to .03 cent lower with
September at $5.061 a troy ounce.

   The stock market closed narrowly mixed in
featureless trading Tuesday after getting a boost early in the day
from new economic data that showed good news on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 0.19 point to finish
at 2,687.31 after gaining more than 10 points during the session.
   Advancing issues narrowly outpaced decliners in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 739 issues
up, 696 down and 536 unchanged.
   The market opened higher and remained above Monday's levels until
the final hour of trading when a mixture of factors pushed the
market lower.
   ``There's no particular reason that the market backed off,'' said
Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany Corp. ``There
was some program trading but that's not the reason. If there's
anything that explains the late decline I would say it's the slight
retreat in bond prices after their early gains.''
   Blue-chip issues led the stock market after the government
reported on consumer prices and housing construction. But the gains
were limited as the broader market lagged, analysts said.
   The Labor Department reported that consumer prices as measured by
its Consumer Price Index remained unchanged in August. It was the
best inflation performance in more than three years.
   The Commerce Department also reported that housing construction
fell 5 percent in August, the largest decline in six months. New
homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.35 million units, down from 1.42 million units in July.
   Wall Street analysts said the numbers suggested an easing of
inflation, and added to hopes that the Federal Reserve will loosen
monetary policy by lowering interest rates.
   Transportation stocks rebounded slightly after being depressed in
recent sessions and pharmaceutical issues showed some strength in an
otherwise dull session lacking in leadership.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 141.61 million
shares, up from 136.94 million in the previous session, with many
institutional investors remaining cautious in light of recent sharp
declines in the junk-bond market.
   ``The junk-bond scare is still a cloud hanging over the market,''
said Brian Luedtke, stock market analyst with Piper Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood Inc.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 168.168 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market advanced $0.031 billion in value,
or less than 1 percent.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up 0.03 to 192.46.
   Among actively traded issues on the New York Stock Exchange,
Manufacturers Hanover rose 2\ to 44 after Monday's announcement that
it had agreed to sell a stake in the company to Japan's Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank in an effort to improve its capital position.
   AT&amp;T rose ] to 42, DuPont gained } to 117 and Phillip Morris
advanced 2\ to 158|.
   Avon, the NYSE's most active stock, fell 2[ to 31}, Varian
declined 1\ to 25} and Ames Department Stores lost ~ to 16|.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index declined 0.20 to 395.98, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dipped 0.18 to 346.55.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market inched
up 0.16 to 467.05. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 378.83, down 0.67.

   Upjohn Co. President and Chief Operating
Officer Lawrence C. Hoff will retire Jan. 1, the pharmaceutical
company said Tuesday.
   Upjohn Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Theodore Cooper will
assume the duties of president and hasn't announced plans to seek a

   Hoff, 60, will remain on the Upjohn board, the company said.
   Hoff joined the company in 1950 as a pharmaceutical sales

marketing in 1969 and was elected to the board in 1973.
   He was promoted to executive vice president in 1977, elected
president of the company in 1984 and named chief operating officer
in 1987.
   Hoff is a board member of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association and served as its chairman in 1988.
   His retirement plans weren't a surprise, Galligan said. ``Mr.
Hoff had a 40-year career here,'' he said. ``He feels the company's

   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc., said some of the declines were due to profit-taking as
traders took advantage of the market's recent rally.
   ``We've been in an advancing market and needed to sell off to
relieve the overbought condition,'' Beutel said.
   There were spates of buying during the day, but prices were
unable to hold at higher levels, Beutel said. The October West Texas
Intermediate contract traded as high as $19.80 during the session
before dropping back.
   Oil traders have become cautious in advance of Saturday's meeting
of the strategy and price-monitoring committee of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The eight-member committee, which is expected to discuss OPEC's
overproduction problems, cannot make any changes in the cartel's
policies but can make recommendations to the full 13-nation
organization.
   Many analysts say market prices could weaken significantly if
OPEC fails to show at this weekend's meeting that it plans to act
decisively to contain overproduction.

   The Democratic-controlled House Labor and
Education Comittee bowed Tuesday to President Bush's rejection of
anything more than a $4.25 minimum wage.
   But it coupled the 90-cent increase in the present $3.35-an-hour
wage floor with restrictions on the 80 percent subminimum ``training
wage'' that Bush is demanding _ a move that administration officials
say will prompt another veto.
   On a party-line voice vote, the committee approved a bill
identical to a measure Bush vetoed in June except that it provides
two hourly increases _ one this January and the other in January
1991 _ of 45 cents each. The vetoed bill had provided for three
annual increases to $4.55 an hour by Oct. 1, 1991.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole reiterated in a memo Bush's
promise to veto any bill which raises the current $3.35 floor to
$4.25 in less than three years or that establishes a subminimum
``training wage'' only for first-time job market entrants. Bush
would allow employers to pay an 80 percent subminimum to any newly
hired workers.
   The committee's chairman, Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif.,
said the reduction from the previous $4.55 wage floor that had been
sought was aimed at garnering support from Southern Democrats and
some Republicans for an override of another Bush veto.
   While both the House and Senate last year approved the $4.55
minimum wage with a 60-day subminimum training wage applicable only
to first-time workers, neither could muster the two-thirds majority
needed to override Bush's veto.
   ``There are some Republican members ready to change their votes
if the president doesn't'' show a willingness to compromise, Hawkins
said.
   Senate sources said the bill could be brought up there within the
next three weeks. Just before Congress recessed in August, the
Senate Labor Committee reapproved the same $4.55 minimum wage bill
that Bush vetoed, but with the understanding that it would likely be
modified on the Senate floor.
   Bush has demanded a six-month training wage compared to the
60-day subfloor Democrats are willing to allow. Both sides have
indicated a willingness to negotiate away differences in the time
span, but neither is budging on the applicability.
   Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., chairman of the House panel's labor
standards subcommittee, said Bush's proposal would allow employers
to pay a $3.40 subminimum wage perpetually by rotating new hires in
and out every 60 days to six months.
   ``I must say to the president, `Read my lips,''' Murphy said,
adopting Bush's campaign motto on higher taxes. ``No way will I
permit that man to sign a fake increase in the minimum wage for some
political purpose two years down the road.''

<HEAD>ConAgra Posts Record Quarterly Sales and Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ConAgra Inc., which lost to Tyson Foods Inc.
in the battle to merge with Holly Farms Inc., reported record sales
and earnings Tuesday for the first quarter of its fiscal year.
   Earnings for the quarter ended Aug. 27 increased 31 percent to
$50 million, or 60 cents a share, from $38.2 million, or 48 cents a
share, in the same quarter a year ago.
   Sales rose 43 percent to $4.01 billion from $2.81 billion in the
year-ago quarter.
   Although ConAgra lost to Tyson in the fight for Holly Farms, the
Omaha-based food company received a $50 million payment from Holly
Farms in June as part of an agreement in case the merger with the
chicken processor failed.
   ConAgra reported a $26.9 million one-time, after-tax gain in the
quarter from the settlement, after expenses. It also took a $24.8
million after-tax charge from a realignment of its processed meat
operations.
   Charles M. Harper, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
company is headed for its 10th straight year of record earnings. He
said sales could reach $16 billion in fiscal 1990.
   The major source of ConAgra's sales gain in the fiscal first
quarter was Sipco, formerly known as Swift Independent Packing
Company, which has annual sales in excess of $3 billion.
   ConAgra acquired the remaining 50 percent of Sipco effective the
beginning of fiscal 1990 and all Sipco sales were included in the
fiscal first quarter.
   Harper said gains were made in the quarter in all three of
ConAgra's basic food industry segments. Consumer frozen foods
earnings were up sharply in the largest industry segment, prepared
foods.
   Poultry earnings advanced and operating profit moved up in the
fresh red meat business as strong beef processing more than offset
weak pork results, the company said.
   Tyson Foods assumed control of 20 percent of the domestic poultry
market last month with the completion of its $1.4 billion merger
with Holly Farms. The buyout followed a takeover struggle for Holly
Farms that began last October and pitted Tyson against ConAgra.

<HEAD>Chances of Market Crash One-in-Four, Experts Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chances of another stock market crash in the
United States in the next two years are about one-in-four, according
to a poll of investment decision-makers released Tuesday.
   The poll, conducted by the Wall Street firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., found a higher expectation of a crash now than in
similar surveys conducted in February and last October.
   Drexel surveyed 232 people in the United States who make
investment decisions for institutions. They included chief
investment officers and corporate financial officers at big
companies, institutional portfolio managers for stocks and bonds,
securities industry analysts and economists.
   On the average, the respondents saw a 26.6 percent chance of a
crash in the United States within two years. They also believe there
is a 39.5 percent chance of a stock market slide in Japan in that
period and a 23.9 percent probability of one occurring in Europe.
   That compares with average probabilities of 23.9 percent for a
U.S. crash in a Drexel poll taken last February, 42.7 percent for
one in Japan and 26.4 for one in Europe.
   In October 1988, one year after the crash that rattled both Wall
Street and world markets, the same survey found an average 22.8
percent chance for the United States, 42.3 percent for Japan and
23.7 percent for Europe, Drexel said.

   The U.S. dollar firmed in early trading Wednesday
against the Japanese yen, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange gained moderately.
   The dollar started trading at 146.23 yen, up 0.50 yen from
Tuesday's close of 145.73 yen. It finished at 145.83 yen in New York
overnight, down from Monday's close there of 145.92 yen.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke anonymously, said the
dollar would remain ``steady'' at about the 146-yen level in advance
of an international monetary conference scheduled to start Saturday
in Washington. Participants in the so-called Group of Seven meeting
include monetary officials and central bankers from Japan, the
United States, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which shed 1.47 points Tuesday, gained 77.89 points, or 0.22
percent, shortly after the market opened to move to 34,548.96.

<HEAD>Brazilians Plan to Meet With Bankers in New York</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Brazilian Treasury minister comments.
No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANCUN, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazilian Treasury Minister Mailson de
Nobrega was quoted as saying Tuesday his country will resume
payments on its huge foreign debt only if it receives $3 billion in
pending credits from its lenders.
   ``The position of Brazil now is that if it receives the credits
it will pay. Otherwise, no,'' the Mexican government news agency
Notimex quoted de Nobrega as saying.
   According to Notimex, de Nobrega said Brazil expects to reach a
temporary agreement with the International Monetary Fund to obtain
$3 billion in credits so it can renew service payments on its $110
billion foreign debt, the largest in the Third World.
   ``In May it was impossible to reach agreement with the IMF, but
now there is confidence it can be achieved, which will allow funds
to be liberated to cover our commitments with international banks,''
de Nobrega said.
   ``Brazil has not declared a moratorium. It suspended payments
because we did not have money and we have not received around $3
billion from Japan and creditor banks,'' he added.
   De Nobrega was quoted as saying the credits will tide his country
over until whoever is elected president in November takes office in
March 1990. He said the new government then will formulate a policy
on the debt.
   Brazil has not paid $1.6 billion in interest payments that came
due Friday. Its officials plan to meet with officials of the IMF in
New York later this week.
   Brazilian officials said their country will not be seeking a
deadline extension on on debt payments, as some reports have
suggested.
   The treasury minister is part of a group of Brazilian government
bankers attending a meeting in this Caribbean resort. Heads of
federal reserve agencies from Latin America, Spain and the
Philippines are meeting to discuss international strategies to deal
with the IMF and the World Bank.
   Sergio Amaral, adviser on international relations in Brazil's
Treasury Ministry, who spoke with The Associated Press by telephone,
he denied that his government will ask the IMF for a 90-day
extension on debt payments.
   Notimex on Monday quoted Wadico Waldir Bucchi, a governor of the
Brazilian Central Bank, as saying Brazil cannot meet its
obligations, but is seeking to gain time in order to receive a $600
million loan awaiting IMF approval that will be used to service the
debt.
   Notimex quoted Bucchi as saying he is sure the IMF will grant the
90-day extension when he meets later this week with officials of
that organization in New York.
   However, Amaral called this report ``a misunderstanding.''
   Brazil has the biggest foreign debt in the Third World.
   The South American country has previously suspended payments and,
according to news reports in Brazil, such a moratorium would help
maintain its reserves of $6 billion but would hurt its chances of
obtaining fresh money from international lenders.

<HEAD>Sir James Loses Another Round in BAT Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir James Goldsmith has lost another
round in his attempt to block state regulators from reviewing his
$21.1 billion bid for BAT Industries PLC, the British parent of
Farmer's Group Inc. and several U.S. retailers.
   U.S. District Judge Dale E. Saffels refused Monday to block the
Kansas Insurance Department review of the hostile takeover bid.
   Los Angeles-based Farmers, the 15th-largest insurance holding
company in the United States, operates in nine states. Insurance
regulators in those states are reviewing BAT's proposed takeover to
assure it is in the best interest of policyholders.
   Federal judges in California, Idaho, Texas and Washington already
have denied similar requests by Goldsmith's company, Hoylake
Investments, for preliminary injunctions blocking review in those
states.
   Goldsmith, who contends state regulators have no constitutional
right to review a foreign takeover, declined a request for comment
Tuesday. Spokesmen said, however, that he intends to continue
appealing the rulings.
   Because of the complexities of the state reviews, a British
takeover monitoring panel last week gave him an unprecedented
yearlong extension of his deadline to complete the takeover.
   As part of Goldsmith's proposal, Farmers Group would be sold to
Axa Midi Assurance, a big French insurer, for $4.5 billion.

<HEAD>Lockheed Cited For 230 Alleged Health And Safety Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency Tuesday again cited
Lockheed Corp., this time for 230 alleged health and safety
violations at its aerospace manufacturing plants in Palmdale, Santa
Clarita and Burbank.
   The violations, 114 of them categorized as posing ``substantial
probability that death or serious physical harm could result,''
include electrical hazards such as improper use of extension cords
and inadequate grounding.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration levied
$44,200 in fines for violations uncovered by inspectors during
reviews of the three plants, said Frank Strasheim, OSHA's regional
director in San Francisco.
   Strasheim said most of the violations have been corrected.
   ``During the lengthy inspections, Lockheed had significantly
increased their safety and health staff and had placed renewed
commitment to putting in place a system which will identify safety
and health hazards and move to eliminate them,'' Strasheim said.
   OSHA had fined Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. nearly $1.5
million in March for 440 violations of record keeping requirements
and safety standards at its Burbank plant.
   Those violations sparked comprehensive inspections at Palmdale,
the Rye Canyon plant in Santa Clarita and at the sprawling Burbank
facility.
   Lockheed ``knew or should have known of the hazard'' presented by
the violations, which include inadequate guarding of machines and a
lack of personal protective equipment such as safety gloves and
respirators, OSHA reports said.
   ``Our policy has been and will continue to be to work with OSHA
to ensure compliance with their regulations,'' Dale Daniels, a
Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. executive vice president, said in
a statement.
