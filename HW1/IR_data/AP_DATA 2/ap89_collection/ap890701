   Hundreds of local law enforcement
officers were buying and selling cocaine Friday in sting operations
across the state aimed at slowing down street-level drug traffic.
   Operation Rock Pile made at least 480 arrests Friday during its
first night.
   ``To our knowledge it's the first time anything like this has
been done,'' George Crolius, a Broward County Sheriff's spokesman,
said in a telephone interview from the Fort Lauderdale command
center.
   The Florida Sheriffs Association organized the operation. John
Doyle, an assistant project director with the National Sheriffs
Association in Alexandria, Va., said he had never heard of local law
enforcement agencies working together in a statewide effort _
although other states have had statewide operations organized from a
state level.
   Fifteen city police departments and at least 61 of Florida's 66
sheriff's departments are participating, according to Crolius, who
estimated that more than 1,000 officers were involved in the project.
   Dade County, which has a countywide police department rather than
a sheriff's office, is also participating.
   The crackdown was scheduled to end midnight Saturday.
   The operation is targeted equally at buyers and sellers, and
includes both ``buy busts,'' which result in the arrests of dealers,
and reverse stings, which result in the arrests of users. Search
warrants will be served as well.
   Most arrests will probably be made in urban areas like Broward
and Dade counties, the Orlando area and Tampa and St. Petersburg,
Crolius said.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Members Of Group That Killed Two U.S. Missionaries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities have arrested members of a
Marxist group that killed two U.S. missionaries and bombed the
motorcade of ex-U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz during a
visit last year, the government said.
   ``In recent days, we apprehended three important members of the
group Zarate Willka,'' one of whom confessed to the motorcade
attack, Interior Minister Eduardo Perez Beltran told a news
conference Thursday night.
   The Armed Liberation Front of Zarate Willka claimed
responsibility for the killings in May of Todd Ray Wilson and
Jeffrey Brent Ball, both 20-year-old Mormon missionaries from Utah.
   Police found a copy of the group's message to the media on the
killings when they searched the residence of brothers Felix and
Nestor Encinas Laguna, the interior minister said. Authorities also
found explosives and detonators there. Felix Encinas Laguna, a
sociology student, and his brother, a member of the technical
faculty at a local university, were at large.
   Perez Beltran said sociology student Constantino Uujra, alias
Pancho, was arrested. The interior minister said the suspect
confessed to the attack in August last year during Shultz's visit.
   In the attack, an assailant threw an explosive device near the
motorcade taking Shultz from the airport to the city center. The
blast broke the windows of some vehicles but there were no injuries.
   Perez Beltran said authorities also arrested the group's
ideologue, physician Gabriel Rojas, and medical student Telma
Salazar, identified as another group member.
   Ball, of Coalville, Utah, and Wilson, of Wellington, Utah, were
gunned down late May 24 as they returned to their apartment in
downtown La Paz. The two were machine gunned by occupants of a small
yellow car.
   Zarate Willka is named after a leader of a civil uprising in 1890
against a law permitting the sale of communal land used by peasants.

   A black woman was nominated Friday as a
candidate for president of the 1.7-million-member United Church of
Christ.
   Delegates at the annual meeting in Fort Worth will decide Monday
whether to choose the Rev. Yvonne V. Delk to succeed the Rev. Avery
D. Post as the denomination's president.
   If she wins, Ms. Delk would be the first black and the first
woman to be elected to head the denomination, according to The
Dallas Morning News. She currently serves as executive director for
the Office for Church in Society.
   The Rev. Paul H. Sherry of Chicago also was nominated Friday by
the 17th General Synod's nominating committee. Sherry serves as
executive director of the church's Community Renewal Society.
   Post has headed the United Church of Christ for 12 years and is
stepping down in October.
   Another black, the Rev. Joseph Evans, briefly served as president
in 1977, but he was appointed to fill an interim term and was not
elected.
   The annual meeting continues through Tuesday.

<HEAD>LI Town Cancels HUD-Financed Swimming Pool</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato's hometown on Long
Island will return $1 million in Department of Housing and Urban
Development funds that were earmarked to build a swimming pool, The
New York Times reported.
   Island Park officials requested earlier this week that their
application for the pool be withdrawn, citing local opposition to
the project and rising costs, the Times reported in its Saturday
editions.
   The officials denied that the cancellation was spurred by a
federal inquiry into HUD-sponsored projects on Long Island,
including in Island Park, the Times said.
   Island Park was awarded the $1 million in grants for the pool
last year after D'Amato, a village resident, personally lobbied
then-HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce, the Times said.
   The money for the pool came from Pierce's discretionary fund. In
a letter to village residents last fall, DAmato praised Pierce's
``wise decision to approve this grant,'' the Times reported.
   The pool was to have been built near a beach.
   An assistant to HUD secretary Jack Kemp said Kemp was pleased the
pool project was dead.
   ``We think the funds can be used for a purpose that will be more
in line with assisting low-income individuals,'' Mary Brunette, the
assistant, told the Times.
   The Times said it got no answer to telephone calls made to
D'Amato's office Friday afternoon.
   In Island Park, investigators are looking into allegations that
HUD-sponsored houses went to politically connected residents instead
of to minorities, as had been planned.

   Police swarmed through gang-infested
neighborhoods Friday night in the first widespread dragnet for
drug-dealing street thugs since the highly-publicized sweeps dubbed
the ``Hammer'' last summer.
   The eight-hour operation on the eve of the July Fourth holiday
weekend targeted gangs in the three neighborhoods terrorized by
gangs.
   Assistant Chief Robert Vernon told 300 officers at a 4 p.m. roll
call that they should remember many residents are law-abiding
citizens.
   Portable booking trailers were set up at the Police Department's
Southeast Division station in the heart of the Watts district which
was ravaged by riots in 1965.
   Police made 70 arrests in the first four hours of the operation,
30 of them narcotics felonies, and 19 of those arrested were
identified as gang members, said police Detective Tony Celli. Twenty
vehicles lacking current registration tags were impounded, he said.
   ``We are here to enforce all the laws that are applicable,'' said
Celli.
   Community outcry over gang thugs who keep residents prisoners in
their own homes prompted the first full-scale police assault in
April 1988. The 1,000-officer weekend sweeps continued at intervals
through the summer.
   Mayor Tom Bradley, a former police lieutenant sworn to a fifth
term Friday, vowed during the first of the 1,000-officer gang task
force sweeps 15 months ago: ``We are going to take these terrorists
off the streets of Los Angeles.''
   Gang violence continued unabated.
   More than one person died in a county gang-related killing for
every day of 1988. There were 452 gang-related slayings in Los
Angeles County in 1988, surpassing the 387 gang-related murders
reported the year before.

   Neon and videotape have replaced oils and
watercolors at an art exhibit devoted exclusively to computers.
   More than 50 works by computer artists from around the world went
on display Friday at The Computer Museum. The art, including two-
and three- dimensional works, kinetic sculpture, animation and
poly-dimensional works on videotape, runs until September.
   Among the works: the 144 neon lights that form San Francisco
artist Karl X. Hauser's ``wall-o-fish'' and New York artist Lillian
Schwartz's chrome-plated mobile ``Capricious Constellation.''
   ``The one thing all these pieces have in common is that they've
been created by both humans and computers,'' said museum spokeswoman
Gail Jennes.
   The exhibit titled ``Computer Art in Context'' is part of a
conference on computer graphics sponsored by Siggraph, one of the
world's leading professional associations of computer graphics
researchers and practitioners.
   Hauser, 34, a glass blower by trade, arranged his neon work with
the use of a computer that controls the lighting and shape of the
design.
   Schwartz designed her giant mobile ``Capricious Constellation''
with the help of scientist Arno Penzias, who won the Nobel Prize for
physics in 1978. The mobile is driven by a computer programmed to
move it at random as if blown by winds.
   The Computer Museum officials say theirs is the only museum in
the world devoted exclusively to computers and their impact on
society. It includes 60 permanent exhibits, an animation theater and
a multimedia robot show.

   In the inlets of Prince William Sound, Exxon Co.
workers flush gooey crude from the craggy shore back into the sea so
it can be skimmed.
   The glop, which has the consistency of mayonnaise, is mixed with
sediment, seaweed and other flotsam. But instead of being burned or
buried, some of it is going to a Seattle refinery where it can be
salvaged as fuel.
   ``They're probably going to try to get every nickel they can,
even if it's turned into asphalt, to try to recover some of their
costs,'' said Doug Johnson, a scientist with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency in Anchorage.
   ``I'd rather see them refine the stuff than incinerate it or put
it in a landfill,'' Johnson said in a telephone interview. ``It's
still fuel. It still has heat potential.''
   Nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude smeared Alaskan
waters three months ago, and almost 1 million gallons of fuel
slicked three sites within 13 hours last weekend.
   Environmentalists and oil company executives may cry over the
spilled cargo, but salvagers are going to work recycling as much of
it as they can.
   ``It's better to use it for it's intended purpose than have it
otherwise foul the environment. Out of these tragedies, we'd like to
see the best made out of a bad situation,'' said Clifford Curtis,
president of the Oceanic Society.
   The ooze is piling up after the latest tanker accidents.
   About 210,000 gallons of goop was put in storage tanks near
Galveston, Texas, after the Panamanian tanker Rachel-B collided with
a barge in the Houston Ship Channel.
   ``The material is relatively clean,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Chris Nelson
of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.
   In Rhode Island, the Coast Guard has stored about 10 million
gallons of fuel and a blend of oil and water skimmed from
Narragansett Bay after the Greek tanker World Prodigy hit Brenton
Reef. The ship's owner is working on a salvage plan.
   ``Our job is to keep it out of the water. We're not sure how much
can be recycled,'' said Lt. Paul Wolf.
   The stickiest problem may be the 243,802 gallons of gunk
recovered from the Delaware River after the Uruguayan tanker
Presidente Rivera dropped anchor too soon and lurched into shallow
water.
   The fuel is so heavy it must be heated before it can be pumped.
When it mixed with water, the spillage congealed into
basketball-sized, fudgelike clumps. The state of Delaware set up
four temporary disposal sites, and it probably will be buried or
burned, officials said.
   ``That stuff coming out of the river is non-recyclable. It's
ruined. It has no value,'' said Bob Caron of Guardian Environmental
Co. in Bear, Del.
   In the calamitous Alaskan spill, procedures are simplified
because Exxon owned the tanker and the cargo that gushed into the
sea.
   Exxon has shipped about 2 millions gallons of goo that is 30 to
50 percent oil to Northwest EnviroServices Co. in Seattle, for
refining. The brew contains water, sand, seaweed and other junk
scooped up by the skimmers, but it can still be refined into
gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel.
   ``We would expect to derive some useful energy out of it,'' said
Roger Dragnich, waste manager for Exxon in Valdez. ``But the value
of recovery is inconsequential in terms of the cost of the cleanup
and environmental damage. You're trying to have the least overall
negative impact.''
   ``Once we remove the water and debris, it can be used in a wide
spectrum of petroleum-related uses,'' said Steve Banchero, president
of Northwest EnviroServices. ``One of our foremost goals is to
reduce the volume that has to be disposed of.''
   Exxon has been burning some non-recyclable oily trash at three
small hospital incinerators in Valdez while it tries to obtain
federal permits to fire up large furnaces on barges. Burial is
costly because Alaska has no hazardous waste sites; crude-tainted
garbage is being shipped to Oregon.
   Even recycling carries a high price tag.
   ``It's very costly to recycle oil loaded with lots of junk. The
cost of refining may be way beyond the value of the oil,'' said Jack
Gould of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group.

<HEAD>Officials Hope To Cope with Strip Cruising</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Saturday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with the wrath of crabby cabbies, miffed
motorists and irate casino owners, officials hope a new curfew will
detour thousands of cruisin' teens who transform the glitzy Las
Vegas Strip into a giant parking lot.
   Two years ago the teen-agers were considered a nuisance by Las
Vegas Metro Police as they tried to control cruising and
congregating.
   ``Then we were talking about 500, maybe 1,000 kids on a weekend
night,'' said Metro Capt. Barbara Connett, who is commander of the
police detachment covering the Strip area. ``It was a manageable
number. Now we're talking upwards of 4,000 kids on a given night.
The problem has mushroomed out of proportion.''
   The problem is blamed on the Strip's growing popularity among
teens and the growth of the city _ from 300,000 eight years ago to
more than 700,000 today.
   ``The numbers were overwhelming,'' Connett said. ``We tried to
control the blocking of the Strip, but all we could do was herd them
up and down the Strip, unless people were willing to hire 500 more
officers'' to bolster the current Strip contingent of 16.
   Casino owners are unhappy because the teens sometimes hassle
tourists, often bumping them into the busy Strip traffic, Connett
said.
   Cab drivers complain it takes forever to drive a few blocks as
teens drive side-by-side down the six-lane road at 5 to 10 mph,
exchanging conversations, obscenities, even passengers.
   The traffic problem is compounded by the fact that 45 percent of
the city's visitors come here by car _ leaving more than 10,000
cars, hundreds of cabs and scores of tour buses jockeying for
position on any given weekend.
   In addition, teen-agers who used to cruise past casinos on
Fremont Street, also known as Glitter Gulch, now drive the Strip
because they were chased away by anti-cruising forces in the late
1970s.
   Flooded with letters from upset tourists and hammered by those
who make a living from the city's $2.5 billion tourism industry, the
Chamber of Commerce huddled with county officials and police in
search of a solution.
   ``It came down to finding a way to get the kids off the Strip
earlier,'' Connett said. ``What we're talking about here is an
`adults only' park in a manner of speaking.''
   The answer was a curfew restricting those under 18 from the Strip
after 9 p.m. Fridays, Saturdays and holidays, unless accompanied by
an adult.
   The curfew went into force June 23 and police reported many
warnings, but no arrests for curfew violations. Connett said
officers will warn teens about the curfew for an unspecified grace
period before turning offenders over to juvenile authorities.
   Teens with legitimate purposes on the Strip, such as visiting
restaurants, are exempt as long as they can explain their presence.
Violators will be detained until their parents pick them up and
repeat offenders will be sent to Juvenile Hall.
   Unhappy teens, who have become accustomed to sharing the
neon-bathed Strip that some call a ``Disneyland for adults,'' have
responded to the cruising ban with the generations-old response ``We
have no place to go, nothing to do.''
   ``That's idiotic,'' Connett says. ``It's the dumbest thing I've
ever heard out of a kid's mouth. This city has probably done as much
or more for its kids than any city in the country.
   ``Some children could be in the center of Disneyland and say they
have nothing to do,'' she said. Connett noted the city has snow
skiing and water skiing 30 minutes away plus a water theme park,
free parks, recreation centers, movies, ice and roller skating
rinks, arcades and other attractions.
   But Las Vegas teens _ or at least a vocal minority _ want to head
for the flashy Strip to mingle with some 100,000 tourists who flock
here each weekend.

<HEAD>Elderly Woman Fights City in Dispute Over Can Collecting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honey Breske is trying to make ends meet by
recycling, but prosecutors have taken the 92-year-old widow to court
over the pile of trash in her yard.
   Now she is looking for a job to earn the money for the court
battle.
   ``Spry ... widow seeking any employment,'' her advertisement
reads. ``Need funds to fight Housing Court. They won't let me
recycle cans for cash.''
   Mrs. Breske placed the ad in a weekly newspaper after the city
went to court to force her to clear debris from her yard, where she
keeps aluminum cans, boxes and other junk she recycles to supplement
her $369 monthy Social Security income.
   Her neighbors complained about the mess.
   ``I don't think it's fair. These things didn't happen until our
husbands died,'' Mrs. Breske said. ``Then they started picking on
us.''
   One of Mrs. Breske's friends, Jean Dunlap, is in trouble with the
city for the same reason. The court has issued a permanent
injunction against storing debris in her yard and issued more than
$10,000 in fines over the last 12 years.
   ``I can't pay nothing,'' said Ms. Dunlap, 70.
   City attorneys handling such cases say many elderly residents are
turning up in Housing Court, accused of creating dangerous piles of
refuse in attempts to earn money.
   ``We have one to two cases every week with this type of
problem,'' said Dolores Quiroz, the assistant corporation counsel
prosecuting Mrs. Breske. ``And that's a conservative estimate.
Sometimes it's one or two a day.''
   The city gets involved in cases where debris poses possible fire
and health hazards.
   ``It was not just a matter of cans and things like that,'' she
said. ``The problem is that they keep collecting it, and it's
causing serious problems with the neighbors.''
   Mrs. Breske finds recyclable items by rummaging through alleys in
her neighborhood. She started collecting about 10 years ago just
after her husband, Harry, was hospitalized for a heart attack.
   He died five years later, leaving Mrs. Breske with a $45,000
hospital bill. She emptied her bank account and sold jewelry to help
pay it.
   ``I went looking for a job a couple of times. When I told them my
age, they said, `What do you want to work for?''' she said. ``So I
got tired of that. I said, `I'll just go pick cans.'''

because of engine trouble, airline officials said. None of the 212
people on board the jetliner were injured.
   Airport manager Bill Restall said the passengers had to wait in

customs officers processed the unexpected visitors.
   Because United decided to repair the broken engine in Saskatoon,
the airline arranged overnight hotel accommodations for the

Alaska on Saturday, he said.
   No cause of the engine trouble was given.

   Police arrested at least seven striking Eastern
pilots and employees Friday as they stopped their cars in a baggage
area at Atlanta's big airport on one of its busiest days.
   ``It is a grassroots movement,'' said Hank Weber, a spokesman for
the Eastern pilots union in Miami. ``Some disgruntled Eastern
strikers, including non-union people, are trying to show their
frustration.''
   Those arrested were charged with misdemeanors _ disobeying an
officer and impeding the flow of traffic _ and nearly all of the
arrested were pulled from cars at an Eastern baggage area at
Hartsfield-Atlanta International Airport.
   Other strikers gathered signatures on petitions that called for a
continued boycott of the airline, which has been crippled by a
four-month strike.
   ``We asked them to move along, but they wanted to shut down this
airport,'' said police Maj. W.B. Shannon. ``This was an obvious
attempt by the union to hurt the citizens of Atlanta. We don't like
it, and we're not going to take it.''
   Airport spokesman John Braden said Friday was one of the busiest
days in Hartsfield's history, with about 140,000 travelers passing
through the airport.
   In New Jersey, about 300 Eastern strikers and supporters marched
on Friday to Newark International Airport and blocked evening
rush-hour traffic heading to the terminal of Continental Airlines,
Eastern's sister airline.
   About 50 police wearing riot gear and holding night sticks tried
to keep the crowd moving through the airport's roads, and another 50
tried to control Friday's rush hour traffic. There was no violence
and no arrests were reported.
   ``The intent is to tell everyone in the whole world that
Eastern's still on strike,'' said Ed Borowick, president of Local
1445 of the International Association of Machinists.
   Borowick said the union was under a court-ordered limit of 15
pickets per entrance, but marchers took over the four traffic lanes
where passengers debark to get to Continental's departure counters
for about an hour.
   Similar plans to greet Miami travelers with airport slowdowns
failed to materialize. A few strikers drove slowly through Miami
International Airport, but they were moved along by special police
teams.
   In New York, Eastern's boss Frank Lorenzo warned that striking
pilots who might want to come back to work likely will find they've
already been bumped from their jobs.
   ``We're not dependent on the pilots coming back, by any means,''
said Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent company, Texas Air Corp.
   Pilots union officials were to meet this weekend with management
and Eastern's court-appointed bankruptcy examiner for talks on a
contract agreement to end their walkout against the company.
   Weber said the slowdown wasn't sanctioned by Eastern's unions,
which mark four months on strike July 4. But strikers from the
pilots, flight attendants and Machinists unions said they would
drive their cars slowly through airport terminal areas on Friday
afternoon, and possibly next Tuesday.
   Ron Gunther, operations director at Miami International Airport,
said extra police officers and tow trucks were called out to lessen
traffic tie-ups. He said holiday travelers should leave an hour or
so earlier than usual to allow for possible delays.
   ``If the unions pull off this blockade-type activity, my reaction
would be they're making the traveling public the innocent victims in
a labor-management dispute,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said.
   Eastern, meanwhile, was gearing up for a tripling of its daily
schedule. With 79 daily flights this week, Eastern was set to hit
226 daily flights beginning Sunday.
   ``We have to see whether they can make the announced schedule and
whether they can sustain it for seven days,'' Weber said. ``Watch
for cancelled flights. They don't have enough pilots.''
   The carrier has been operating less than 10 percent of its
pre-strike schedule of around 1,000 flights a day since the strike
that started March 4. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization on March 9 and says it will rebuild as a smaller
airline.
   In an interview Friday, Lorenzo said any returning strikers would
find most of the available jobs at the new, scaled-down Eastern were
taken up by the 500 or so new hires and 300 who crossed picket lines
who already are working and by other pilots who will complete
training in the weeks ahead.
   Eastern also is near agreement with creditors over its plan to
emerge from bankruptcy court protection as a scaled-down carrier
that would require only about 1,700 pilots to operate by December at
its target level of around two-thirds of its pre-strike size. That
compares with the 3,600 that flew the pre-strike version.
   The unions are backing a buyout bid for Eastern led by Chicago
commodities trader Joseph Ritchie.

   In the dog-eat-dog world of Washington
politics, the publishers of ``The Washingtonian'' magazine have
decided to eat a little crow for calling the presidential pet the
ugliest canine in the capital.
   ``Before you go away for the July 4th weekend, we would like to
apologize for picking Millie the ugliest dog in Washington,'' Editor
John A. Limpert said in a letter delivered Friday to the White House.
   He also sent a gift of dog biscuits to the offended beast.
   ``You'll be pleased to know that our mail and phone calls are
running about 99 to 1 in favor of Millie,'' he said. ``It's clear
that our words were unpopular as as well as impolite.''
   President Bush jotted off a note in response: ``Not to worry!
Millie, you see, likes publicity. ... Arf, arf for the dog
biscuits.''
   Millie, an English springer spaniel whose confinement and
delivery of a litter of pups kept Barbara Bush and the part of the
rest of the country in suspense earlier this year, was listed in a
``Best and Worst'' story in the magazine's July issue.
   The magazine called Millie the ``White House mutt.''
   Mrs. Bush promised this week that Millie would get the last word
in a book the first lady planned to ghostwrite for the pet. Bush
called Millie beautiful and said, ``I know how Franklin Roosevelt
felt with the attack on Fala,'' his dog.

   Toads have invaded a street in this Alameda
County town and no one seems to mind.
   Thousands of thumbnail-size toads have taken over Spruce Lane and
cover driveways, back yards, patios and the street. There are so
many that residents have to take special care when walking and have
given up mowing the lawns.
   ``They're just babies and we are afraid we'll run over them,''
said Jeanne Ferguson. ``When we go out, we just tippy-toe out of our
house so we don't step on them.''
   Officials say the toads are nothing to worry about.
   ``They carry no diseases that we know of and they don't
particularly harm anything,'' said Hal Rice, a vector control
supervisor.
   Besides, toads enjoy dining on the same insects that can be pests
to homeowners and gardeners, he said.
   The toads probably came from a nearby drainage canal, he said.
Toad invasions occur occasionally, Rice said, but the reasons for
sudden surges in toad population are unclear.

<HEAD>Government Settles Ohio Nuclear Weapons Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department has tentatively agreed to
pay at least $73 million to Ohio residents who claimed damage by
radioactive contamination from a government-owned plant near Fernald
that produces nuclear weapons materials.
   A lawsuit filed by five residents as a class action had sought
$300 million.
   The settlement underscores the government's intensified effort to
regain public confidence in its nuclear weapons program, which is
run from 17 major plants in 12 states. Many of the sites are badly
polluted from four decades of bomb making.
   The government has acknowledged that at least 383,000 pounds of
radioactive uranium oxide dust had been released through faulty
filters at the Fernald facility since the plant opened in 1951. The
full extent of environmental damage has not been determined.
   Louise Roselle, one of the attorneys for the 14,000 people living
within five miles of the plant who are represented in the class
action, said the settlement allows for an additional $5 million
payment to nearby businesses if they can show lost property value.
   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, said the terms were
approved by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins late Friday and would
be presented to U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel in Cincinnati
next week.
   Watkins has said he would step up department efforts to resolve
past environmental damage from nuclear weapons plants and limit
future harm.
   ``It's a major concern to us,' said Moore. ``This whole idea of
this lawsuit, with people being upset, diminution of property values
_ all these kinds of things would not have occurred if we had done
it right in the past.''
   Watkins earlier this week blamed his own department for disarray
in the weapons program, saying key managers and supervisors lacked
technical skills and some lacked the necessary discipline for safe
operation of nuclear reactors.
   The congressman whose district includes the plant predicted more
lawsuits by people who live near contaminated bomb factories. ``It's
a tragedy that the taxpayers are bearing the brunt of 35 years of
contamination and concealment,'' said Rep. Tom Luken, D-Ohio.
   In the Ohio lawsuit, residents near the Feed Materials Production
Center at Fernald, about 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, said
radioactive contamination from the uranium plant polluted soil, air
and water in their area. They claimed this caused them mental stress
and reduced the value of their property.
   Moore said he sympathized with the public's concerns about
possible illegal pollution from nuclear weapons plants, but he
expressed doubt about the Fernald claims.
   ``A lot of that is hysteria,'' he said. ``There really wasn't,
judging by what I heard ... a lot of hard evidence of anybody losing
anything _ as a matter of fact, almost none.''
   He said he believed the settlement, if made final, would be the
first of its kind.
   Judge Spiegel scheduled an Aug. 23 hearing on the agreement. If
the judge approves the settlement, the government must deposit the
money into four Cincinnati banks no later than Oct. 15, said Roselle.
   A U.S. District Court jury in Cincinnati earlier this month
recommended in a mock trial that the Fernald residents be awarded
$136 million. The recommendation was issued as a non-binding
verdict, a procedure used in Ohio to encourage settlement of a
lawsuit before it goes to trial.
   The plant was run for the Energy Department by National Lead of
Ohio Inc., until 1986.
   The residents' group filed suit against National Lead and its
parent company, but the Department of Energy has accepted
responsibility for its contractor because of an indemnification
clause in its contract, and the government has provided defense
counsel to its contractor.

   President Bush, marking the 25th anniversary of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, says he will be satisfied ``with
nothing less than equality of opportunity for all Americans''
including 36 million who have disabilities.
   ``While celebrating our achievements and recommitting ourselves
to their preservations, we must recognize that the full promise of
the civil rights movement has still not been achieved,'' he told 200
civil rights leaders at a White House ceremony Friday.
   ``The hard lesson of the passing years is that it has not been
enough to wage a war against the old forms of bigotry and
inequality,'' the president said before flying off for a long
holiday weekend in Maine.
   Bush called on Congress ``to join me in a new partnership to
reauthorize the Civil Rights Commission with a goal of launching a
renewed civil rights mission.''
   The commission's six-year authorization expires Nov. 30.
   Civil rights leaders Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King III,
Benjamin Hooks, Vernon Jordan and James Farmer attended the ceremony.
   The landmark civil rights law was signed by President Lyndon B.
Johnson on July 2, 1964. The act banned segregation in public
accommodations and paved the way for court action to end bias in
hiring and promotions.
   Also in the audience was Rosa Parks, whose defiant refusal to
move to the back of a Montgomery, Ala., bus on Dec. 1, 1955, was an
early milestone in the civil rights movement.
   Bush said the gathering was ``not only to commemorate an
anniversary, but to celebrate a movement, and to rededicate our
efforts to the unfinished work of that movement.''
   However, some civil rights leaders say recent Supreme Court
decisions restricting affirmative action and making it more
difficult to prove discrimination in the workplace have hurt the
civil rights movement.
   ``There was more damage done to civil rights statutes in the last
2{ weeks than in the last 2{ decades,'' said Ralph Neas, executive
director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
   Bush did not directly address civil rights leaders' concerns, but
called for ``vigilant and aggressive enforcement'' of civil rights
and said his administration won't tolerate discrimination.
   Jackson told reporters that justice had become ``more expensive,
more distant and less likely to come'' because of the high court
rulings.
   He said ``we need a meeting of some substance with the president
to deal with legislative remedies to offset the impact'' of the
Supreme Court decisions.
   But some said Bush seems more interested in defending the flag
than the ideals the flag represents, alluding to his call for a
constitutional amendment to outlaw desecration of the flag.
   ``So far they have put flag rights over workers' rights, over
basic civil rights,'' Jackson said after the ceremony.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in Chicago earlier this
week that the Bush administration won't pursue legislation to
overturn the recent high court decisions affecting civil rights,
preferring to wait until their impact can be assessed.
   Bush said economic barriers affect the lives of the disadvantaged
as much as the remnants of legal discrimination.
   ``For that reason, I continue to support affirmative action and
minority outreach programs,'' Bush said. ``We will be satisfied with
nothing less than equality of opportunity for all Americans _ and
the removal of final barriers to self-reliance.''

alcohol in a vehicle and had an expired registration when stopped
June 14.
   The charges carry various sentences upon conviction ranging from
a $100 fine for the violations of the Motor Vehicle Code to a $2,000
fine and a year in jail on the battery charge.
   The actress maintains she was roughed up unnecessarily during the
June 14 arrest and has threatened to sue the Police Department. She

   ``She took phone calls every morning and there were two sides.
The number of people who support her were more than there were

   Most of the calls were about Bakker, whose PTL ministry crumbled

   Hahn, 29, said she had never talked to Swaggart, whose television
ministry also was shaken by a sex scandal, although she told her
listeners he had many things to say about her when the Bakker

<TEXT>
   Nearly 20 years after Sen. Edward Kennedy's car
plunged off the bridge at Chappaquiddick Island, several grand
jurors who investigated the accident have come forward to say the
district attorney hindered their probe.
   One of the jurors, Robert E. Maciel, said Friday that there was a
``cover up'' in the case, but said he believed Kennedy was the
victim, not the perpetrator.
   ``I think the man is innocent,'' Maciel said. ``I don't believe
Kennedy was driving that car. I think he took the blame for somebody
else.''
   Mary Jo Kopechne, a 28-year-old secretary, was a passenger in
Kennedy's Oldsmobile when it skidded off Dike Bridge in Martha's
Vineyard on July 19, 1969. Trapped in the vehicle, she drowned in 8
feet of water in a tidal pond.
   The Massachusetts Democrat, who did not report the accident to
police until 10 hours later, received a suspended sentence for
leaving the scene.
   Maciel and the grand jury foreman, Leslie H. Leland, said former
District Attorney Edmund Dinis prevented the 23-member jury from
calling several key witnesses, including Kennedy and his cousin,
Joseph Gargan Jr., because they had previously testified at an
inquest.
   Leland, a 49-year-old pharmacist on Martha's Vineyard, said
Dinis, the Dukes County prosecutor, also refused to let the grand
jury read the transcript of the inquest.
   ``When those two avenues were closed off, there was nothing for
us to do really but go home,'' Leland said.
   Dinis, who is now in private practice in New Bedford, did not
return telephone calls from The Associated Press to his home and
office Friday.
   He previously has denied stonewalling the investigation and has
said there was not enough evidence to justify indicting Kennedy for
manslaughter.
   Leland and Maciel said they have spoken out after two decades
because they want the truth to come out and to clear the grand
jury's name.
   ``I've lived with this thing for 20 years, and there have been
all these innuendos that we were bought off,'' Leland said. ``The
bottom line is, the grand jury tried its hardest to get to the
truth, but we were not able to do our job.''
   Kennedy has said he made a wrong turn that night and ended up on
the narrow Dike Bridge. He also has said that he and a friend
repeatedly dove to the car in unsuccessful rescue attempts, and that
afterward he was ``exhausted and in a state of shock.''
   Maciel, who owns a boatyard on Martha's Vineyard, said he did not
believe that Kennedy, a frequent visitor to the island, would have
made that wrong turn. He said he did not know why Kennedy would have
taken the blame for someone else, ``unless it was someone very
young.''
   The Standard Times of New Bedford also reported Friday that
several other jurors have backed statements by Leland criticizing
the investigation.
   ``It was a coverup,'' said Lloyd Mayhew, a grand juror now living
in Mattapoisett. ``I support every single word Mr. Leland said.
Everybody covered for Kennedy.''
   Leland was quoted in the July 3 issue of Newsweek as saying that
two unidentified ``key lawmen'' took him for a ride and told him
there was no need for a thorough investigation.
   He said Friday he stood by that account.
   Helen Mosher, a Tisbury housewife, told the New Bedford newspaper
that the jury experience left her ``disgusted.''
   ``What took place, took place, but it should've been handled
differently,'' she said. ``I got a lot of questions from people, but
I'd say nothing. People said `you got paid off' and all that, but I
let it go over my head.''

   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development's inspector general says the agency ignored repeated
warnings for tighter controls on lenders in a troubled program now
under House investigation.
   ``On at least five occasions ... we have reported to HUD
management and to Congress that program improvements were needed,''
said HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams as the House Government
Operations housing and employment subcommittee began hearings Friday
on the program.
   The program, known as ``coinsurance'' because the government
assumed part of the liability on loans with lenders, showed signs of
problems two years after it was instituted in 1983 as a hallmark of
Reagan administration efforts to turn the functions of many
government programs over to private business.
   A November 1985 internal audit of eight projects showed
``inappropriate lender underwriting practices caused inflated
mortgages,'' Adams said.
   The subcommittee has been examining possible abuse,
influence-peddling and mismanagement in HUD programs during the
Reagan administration.
   HUD officials promised to ``improve lender monitoring processes
and enforcement actions,'' although they rejected Adams' assessment
of the problems and said controls he suggested were so strict they
would discourage participation, he said.
   Lenders are paid an annual fee of about 4 percent of a project's
operating income as an incentive to repair, rehabilitate or build
low- and moderate-income multi-family housing.
   If a borrower defaults, lenders are responsible for about 20
percent of the loss while HUD picks up the tab for the remaining 80
percent.
   HUD now faces more than $100 million in claims against bad loans
made in the program, said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., subcommittee
chairman.
   In the most recent audit in March 1989, Adams found the Benton
Mortgage Company of Knoxville, Tenn., had misrepresented mortgage
amounts and rents on 14 projects it had underwritten, creating an
estimated $22 million in excessive mortgages, said Adams.
   He said the government would pay excessive subsidies of $37
million over the 15-year period of contracts for rental housing
Benton had coinsured.
   Benton is one of three companies which has been placed on six
months' probation from the program. Three companies have been
suspended and three others are under review by HUD, Adams said.
   Adams revealed Friday that Benton is the subject of a grand jury
investigation, which he said he would not discuss.
   Adams said his first report of problems in the coinsurance
program was sent to then-Assistant Secretary of Housing Phil Abrams,
one of several former HUD employees who was paid as a consultant on
projects funded under the moderate rehabilitation program.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., observed that ``Abrams used Benton
in all of his deals,'' in that program.
   Meanwhile, congressional pressure is mounting for a complete
review of the housing department.
   One staffer said Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., has sent a letter to
panel members seeking authorization for an investigation.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Banking, Housing
and Urban Affairs subcommittee on housing, said Friday he would vote
for a probe of the ``scandal-ridden'' department.
   And House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
said HUD Secretary Jack Kemp would testify before his panel July 12
to discuss reform measures being developed in the agency.

   The National Space Council has decided to urge
President Bush to keep the ``space plane'' alive but limit its
development program to the testing of unproven technology.
   The program is aimed at the development of a plane capable of
taking off from a conventional runway, going into orbit and landing
on a regular runway.
   President Reagan called it the ``Tokyo Express'' for the
projected two-hour flight time from New York to Tokyo.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposed eliminating the project or
transferring to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
most of the $427 million proposed by Reagan in the Pentagon budget
for the next fiscal year.
   The council recommended the project get $254 million next year,
shared equally by NASA and the Defense Department, The Washington
Post said in its Saturday editions. A spokesman for Vice President
Dan Quayle, chairman of the council, said Friday night he did not
have dollar figures for the recommendations.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee recommended $412 million,
with $127 million from NASA.
   A council staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the program's focus had expanded over the past four years, so that
nuts-and-bolts questions like payload were being considered before
researchers had proven with an experimental craft that the plane
would be able to fly at 25 times the speed of sound.
   Nearly $2 billion has been spent on the program over the past
four years. Potential contractors have spent $700 million of their
own funds.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is proposing a
broad overhaul of top Pentagon committees that would give a small
group the power to make major decisions, according to an
administration source.
   Cheney, responding to President Bush's request for a review of
defense management, recently sent the White House a proposal to form
an ``Executive Committee'' that would assume many of the powers of
the current Defense Resources Board, the source told The Associated
Press late Friday.
   ``We are waiting for the president's decisions,'' the source said.
   The Defense Resources Board, which advises Cheney on major
weapons and budgetary decisions, would become the Defense Planning
and Resources Board with a broader planning task.
   It would be subordinate to the Executive Committee, which would
be comprised of the secretary, the deputy secretary, the
undersecretary for policy, the undersecretary for acquisitions, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the secretaries of the
Army, Navy and Air Force.
   ``These are the people who are setting the policy anyway,'' said
the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Cheney also would reorganize the Defense Acquisitions Board in an
effort to ``streamline the lines of authority in procurement in
carrying out acquisition policies down through the service
acquisition chiefs and program managers,'' the source said.
   The acquisitions board would scrutinize the cost and performance
tradeoff decisions made in the early stages of a weapons program.
   The service secretaries would be dropped from the acquisitions
board, ``cut out of the loop, but at the same time they would be put
back in at the top'' through membership on the Executive Committee,
the source said.
   The source largely confirmed an account of Cheney's plans first
reported Friday night by Defense News, a weekly journal of defense
policy and politics.

   The Bush administration says it is looking for
help from the Palestine Liberation Organization in holding elections
on the West Bank and Gaza.
   ``If they can be responsible and constructive here in helping,
great,'' Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said
Friday while defending two unannounced meetings in Tunis with Salah
Khalaf, the second-in-command to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   But supporters of Israel accelerated their criticism of the
expanded dialogue U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau is having in
Tunisia with PLO officials.
   Thomas A. Dine, executive director of the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee, said ``we are deeply distressed to learn that the
administration has conducted secret meetings with the founder of
Black September, one of the most brutal terrorists of recent years.''
   Dine said in a statement that Khalaf, known also as Abu Iyad,
``has publicly boasted of his terrorist deeds against Americans and
Israelis and bragged about his ability to deceive the United
States.''
   The head of the pro-Israel lobbying and research group called the
meetings in Tunis ``a blow to the confidence necessary to move the
peace process forward.''
   Seymour D. Reich, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of
Major American Jewish Organizations, called Khalaf a ``notorious
terrorist'' and said bringing him into the talks ``can only breed
mistrust and cast suspicion on the depth of our country's
longstanding commitments to Israel.''
   On Thursday, Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad, registered his
government's regret and disappointment in a meeting with Assistant
Secretary of State John Kelly. Arad told the U.S. specialist on the
Middle East the meetings hurt prospects for holding the elections.
   The elections were proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir and endorsed by President Bush and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III as a way of getting peace talks started.
   The idea is to have the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs living
under Israeli control on the West Bank and in Gaza choose leaders
who would negotiate temporary and local self-rule. Israel, the
Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan would negotiate a permanent
settlement in a second stage of talks.
   The PLO has publicly criticized the plan as a device to prevent
creation of a Palestinian state.
   Spokeswoman Tutwiler claimed only limited progress in the talks.
``I have no reason to believe that it has not been constructive,''
she said.
   The U.S. official said Pelletreau had held several unannounced
meetings with various PLO officials and was likely to hold others.
   ``Our objective in the dialogue is to advance the peace process
and to underscore our expectation that the PLO will adhere to its
renunciation of terrorism,'' she said.

   A New York pharmaceutical company says its
employees appear to have won government approval for one of the
firm's generic drugs for treating high blood pressure by
substituting the brandname product for its own in comparison tests.
   ``It would appear that that is the case,'' Roger W. Jordan,
president of Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Springfield Gardens,
N.Y., said Friday.
   Jordan said he believes the company's drug, which has been
recalled, is safe.
   A congressman, however, said the case raises questions about the
drug's safety as well as the government's drug approval process.
   The drug is a generic Dyazide, a widely prescribed treatment for
high blood pressure. SmithKline Beckman Corp. of Philadelphia
developed Dyazide and marketed it for 20 years before the first
generic version was approved two years ago. Vitarine was approved in
February 1988.
   Vitarine recalled its product a month ago. At least three
employees have been suspended, the company said.
   However, Jordan said, preliminary results of a just-completed
comparison study measuring the rate and extent of absorption of the
two drugs shows that Vitarine's product falls within an ``acceptable
range.''
   ``Vitarine has no reason to expect any safety or efficacy
problems with this product. Vitarine has produced millions of dosage
units since the product was first introduced in February 1988 and as
of this date has received only six adverse experience reports,'' he
said.
   Jordan declined to elaborate on the findings of the company's
internal investigation, except to confirm that the company told the
FDA it suspected Dyazide was substituted for Vitarine's product in
comparison tests. As a result, Dyazide would have been tested
against only another sample of Dyazide.
   The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee, which brought the possibility to public light
Thursday, said the case raises questions about how the FDA approves
generic drugs.
   ``Events suggest that we can no longer be assured that the
products tested are the products marketed,'' said Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., subcommittee chairman.
   ``That such a simple but apparently effective fraud could have
gone undetected raises some serious new questions about the safety
and efficacy of these drugs, and about the law,'' he said.
   The FDA acknowledged that it is investigating the company, but
spokesman Jeff Nesbit said he couldn't comment on the inquiry or
address the safety of the Vitarine drug.
   An FDA source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
agency doubted the generic version was unsafe because it had
undergone other tests and no problems with people using it had been
reported.

<HEAD>Alleged White House Tour for Male Prostitutes is Focus in Sex Ring
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Secret Service does not know who authorized
a private White House tour allegedly given to members of a
homosexual prostitution ring now under federal investigation, a
spokesman says.
   The focus on private White House tours came after The Washington
Times reported that prominent Washington lobbyist Craig J. Spence
arranged tours of the White House _ once around midnight _ for
friends and business associates.
   The paper reported in its Friday editions that one such group
included two male prostitutes from escort services that are now the
subject of an investigation by U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens.
   Secret Service spokesman Allan Cramer said Friday that staffers
holding White House passes can escort guests through the West Wing,
site of the Oval Office, at special times. But he said records from
the Reagan administration, when the tour in question allegedly
occurred, are no longer available.
   One unidentified man quoted by the Times recalled a tour late on
the night of July 3, 1988.
   Cramer said the Secret Service did not know who vouched for the
party that night because all White House records from the period,
including visitors' logs, have been shipped to California for
eventual placement in the Ronald Reagan library, which has yet to be
constructed.
   The Times said credit card records it obtained show that Spence
frequently patronized a homosexual prostitution network that ran the
escort services.
   Spence, once a registered foreign agent for Japan, is known as a
Washington power-broker whose parties during the Reagan
administration attracted prominent individuals including former CIA
Director William Casey, journalist Ted Koppel and James Lilley, the
ambassador to China.
   Stephens and the Secret Service confirmed Thursday they are
investigating possible credit card fraud involving the escort
services, which operated under names such as ``Dream Boys'' and
``Man to Man.''
   The investigation is based on records seized in raids on a house
in an upscale Washington neighborhood that police say was used by
the services. Police seized numerous bank statements, credit card
slips and a diary of the business.
   The Times reported the ring was patronized by Reagan and Bush
administration officials and congressional aides. Paul R. Balach
resigned his job as Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole's political
personnel liaison to the White House on Thursday after his name
appeared in the Times' original story on the investigation.
   Spence spent thousands of dollars on the escort services, the
Times said. On Oct. 5, 1988, for instance, he made four separate
payments totaling $1,525 with his American Express card for male
escorts from Professional Services Inc., it said.
   In the Bush administration, White House staff members can bring
guests on private tours of the West Wing on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., after 1 p.m. on Saturday and all
day on Sunday, Cramer said.
   Before a guest is cleared into the White House compound, a staff
member must provide agents with information such as a date of birth
and Social Security number.

   A federal judge has cleared the way for Oliver
North's sentencing next Wednesday in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   North, facing up to 10 years in prison and $750,000 in fines,
lost a bid for a mistrial Friday.
   U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell said no evidence existed
that a juror who gave the court inaccurate information was biased
against the former White House aide.
   Juror Tara Leigh King responded `no'' last Feb. 1 when asked
whether she or relatives had been involved in court proceedings or
an investigation.
   North's lawyers disclosed after his trial that one of King's
brothers had served time in prison for armed robbery and that the
woman had testified before a grand jury in connection with the
criminal investigation of her brother.
   She testified Wednesday she forgot about the episode when she
answered the courtroom questionnaire Feb. 1. Gesell said in a
nine-page order that King's testimony probably wasn't believable,
but that it didn't matter in deciding whether she was biased against
North.
   ``The court cannot credit King's testimony ... Her omission was
knowing, but she had no desire to help or to hurt North or the
prosecution,'' Gesell said in a nine-page order.
   `No proof was presented indicating that King was unfair or that
she failed in any way to serve conscientiously,'' he added.
   North was convicted May 4 for aiding and abetting an obstruction
of Congress, altering and destroying documents and illegally
accepting a gratuity.
   North had moved for the mistrial, saying King was prejudiced
against North.
   `She voted to acquit North of many felony counts,'' Gesell said
of King.
   North was acquitted on nine other charges.
   The judge said that embarrassment and a desire to serve on the
jury, rather than forgetfulness, were the reasons King failed to
disclose the background information last February.
   North's lawyers hired a private detective agency to investigate
her background after she told a television interviewer she had used
drugs, adding that she had stopped months before North's trial.
   ``Situations of this type arise with some frequency in cases when
the defense has ample resources,'' said the judge. ``They must be
resolved in favor of the verdict when bias against the defendant has
not been established in fact or by implication.''

   U.S. Rep. Donald E. Lukens is confident of
winning an appeal despite receiving a 30-day jail term for having
sex with a 16-year-old girl, an aide said.
   The 58-year-old Republican was freed on a $100,000 surety bond
Friday.
   Franklin County Domestic Relations Court Judge Ronald Solove
sentenced Lukens to the maximum penalty on the misdemeanor charge of
contributing to the unruliness of a child, but overturned Lukens'
conviction of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
   William Jarrell, Lukens' chief of staff, said in an interview
from Washington that the dropping of the delinquency charge was a
``very good sign for our appeal.''
   Solove, citing Lukens' apparent lack of remorse, told the
congressman he was ``convinced you are a sex offender.''
   The court was ``struck by the unwillingness of the defendant to
recognize that he was not the victim,'' Solove said. ``You have
refused to take that degree of responsibility.''
   Lukens, who is divorced, was convicted May 26 for paying Rosie
Coffman $40 to have sex with him at his Columbus apartment on Nov. 6.
   Solove sentenced him to 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, but
suspended all but 30 days of the sentence and $500 of the fine.
Lukens was placed on probation for one year.
   Solove said the suspended sentence and fine depend on whether
Lukens follows terms of his probation, which require him to
participate in sex offender programs and submit to testing for
sexually transmitted diseases.
   Lukens left the courtroom without commenting to reporters. But
Jarrell said the congressman had no need to show remorse.
   ``When Congressman Lukens' conviction is overturned at the
appeals level, Judge Solove will then understand why he showed no
remorse. He is innocent,'' he said.
   Mrs. Coffman, whose complaint about Lukens led to his indictment,
was escorted from the room immediately after the hearing. She is
serving a jail term for violating probation stemming from a 1983
drunken driving conviction.
   Conviction on a misdemeanor does not automatically bar Lukens
from Congress. He has vowed to remain in office and pursue his
appeal.
   Local Republicans have called for Lukens to resign, and the House
Ethics Committee has been asked to investigate the case.
   Lukens served two terms in Congress from 1967 to 1970, when he
lost a bid for the GOP gubernatorial nomination. After 15 years in
the Ohio Senate, he was returned to Congress by voters in 1986.

   The National Right to Life Committee's
convention turned its aim from abortion to euthanasia, and members
were urged to fight what one speaker called ``institutionalized
heartlessness.''
   ``Euthanasia is a clear and present danger in America,'' James
Bopp Jr., general counsel of the committee, said Friday on the
second day of the group's annual convention.
   Many who have strong convictions that abortion is wrong haven't
taken such a firm stand on euthanasia, said John Dolan, a member of
the steering committee of the University of Minnesota's Program in
Human Rights and Medicine.
   ``We have to protect the elderly and disabled as we would protect
ourselves,'' Dolan said.
   ``There is a movement toward institutionalized heartlessness,
contempt and disdain for caring. Euthanasia is the necessary
terminus of this movement,'' he said. ``People have died of
deliberate dehydration. The patients did not ask to be starved to
death and were not terminally ill.''
   Dr. Allen Jay argued that artificial administration of nutrition
and hydration is not the same as using extraordinary medical means
to keep a patient alive. The San Diego physician gained national
attention when he refused a court order to withhold food and water
from a 92-year-old Alzheimer's patient whose daughter wanted to end
her life.
   Jay said it was important that physicians know they have the
right to follow their moral and ethical conscience.
   ``Having a physician's role in society defined by legislators or
attorneys is a terrible, terrible thing,'' he said. ``We are all
responsible for our own actions regarding our own conscience.''
   David N. O'Steen, the committee's executive director, urged
members to oppose euthanasia as strongly as they do abortion.
   Withholding artificial administration of food and water ``is
really starving people to death,'' said O'Steen. The logical next
step would be lethal injection, he maintained.
   ``When we come to this point, it will be too late,'' he said.
``The time to act is now because society at large has not yet
accepted the stark reality of what is being done.''

<TEXT>
   Tiananmen Square re-opened to the public Saturday,
nearly four weeks after army tanks rolled into the vast grounds in a
bloody suppression of China's pro-democracy movement.
   Hundreds of people who had obtained special permission filed
through the square in orderly lines, gazing at the Forbidden City's
Gate of Heavenly Peace and the few soldiers who patrol the square.
   Hundreds of cheerful tourists also gathered on the rostrum above
the gate itself, where China's revolutionary founder, Mao Tse-tung,
declared the founding of the People's Republic four decades ago.
   There was no sign of the terror and grief that engulfed Tiananmen
June 3-4, when the People's Liberation Army stormed the square,
shooting its way through hundreds of thousands of unarmed protesters.
   The government says about 300 people were killed, half of them
soldiers. Chinese witnesses and Western diplomats say the deaths
were in the thousands.
   Chinese tourists paid 10 yuan ($2.70), two days' wages for many
workers, to stand atop the gate, which along with the square was
re-opened to mark Saturday's 68th anniversary of the founding of the
Communist Party of China.
   Many enthusiastically snapped photographs and sought autographs
from a senior military commander and a deputy mayor of Beijing.
   Groups of a dozen soldiers armed with AK-47 rifles marched by the
gate every minute.
   Tiananmen opened a day after former Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang was stripped of his last government title.
   Zhao, ousted as party general secretary a week ago, was dismissed
by senior leader Deng Xiaoping as vice chairman of the State Central
Military Commission. Deng is chairman of the commission.
   Zhao was effectively ousted more than a month ago, after he paid
a tearful visit on May 19 to students on a hunger strike in
Tiananmen. He has not been seen since.
   President Yang Shangkun, who spent his career in the military,
reportedly was seeking to replace Zhao on the commission. The
commission's senior vice chairman is second only to Deng in the
government's military command hierarchy.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Rules IRA Member Should Be Deported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has decided
that a member of the Irish Republican Army should be deported to the
United Kingdom, where he has been convicted and sentenced to life in
prison for killing a British soldier.
   Thornburgh overruled an immigration appeals board finding that
Joseph Patrick Thomas Doherty could reopen proceedings to seek
political asylum.
   But Doherty cannot be deported immediately because of a pending
legal challenge to a 1988 deportation order by then-Attorney General
Edwin Meese III, said Justice Department spokesman David Runkel.
   The challenge is pending before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New York.
   ``In my discretion, I would not grant the respondent asylum,''
Thornburgh said. ``It is the policy of the United States that those
who commit acts of violence against a democratic state should
receive prompt and lawful punishment.''
   Deporting Doherty to the United Kingdom ``would unquestionably
advance this important policy,'' Thornburgh wrote.
   The State Department had previously determined that deporting
Doherty ``is in the foreign policy interests of this country.''
   The Doherty case has been the focus of political controversy,
particularly among a group of House members from New York City who
contend he should be treated as political refugee.
   Doherty's supporters were upset by Thornburgh's decision.
   Rep. Eliot L. Engell, D-N.Y., said it was ``an outrage that flies
in the face of American justice.''
   ``It's morally, legally and politically indefensible,'' said
Peter King, Republican comptroller of Nassau County in the suburbs
of New York City. ``Thornburgh is allowing the Justice Department
and the American legal system to be an accessory to Margaret
Thatcher's British government.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has also urged Thornburgh to grant
Doherty's request for political asylum.
   Doherty, 34, was convicted of killing a British Army captain
during a 1980 ambush of British troops in Ulster. He escaped from a
prison in Belfast the next year and was arrested in New York City in
1983. He has been held in federal custody since then.
   Thornburgh overruled a Nov. 14 Board of Immigration Appeal ruling
that Doherty could reopen his request for political asylum.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service began deportation
proceedings in 1984 after a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., ruled
Doherty could not be extradited because his crime was a political
act that made him eligible for asylum.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State attorneys say they will fight a
judge's decision to overturn a law requiring parental consent for
abortions performed on minors in a case that could be affected by a
long-awaited Supreme Court ruling.
   The parental consent law, passed by the General Assembly in 1988,
was to have taken effect today, two days before the U.S. Supreme
Court was expected to announce action on a Missouri law seeking to
limit legalized abortion.
   ``The statute's vagueness can be expected to have a substantial
chilling effect upon a minor's right to obtain an abortion,'' U.S.
District Judge John T. Nixon said Friday in a ruling made after
about an hour of oral arguments.
   The national Planned Parenthood Federation and the American Civil
Liberties Union of Tennessee challenged the law, seeking a
preliminary injunction blocking its enforcement if the issue had not
been decided Friday.
   Deputy Attorney General Michael Catalano said the state will
consider an appeal to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court after reviewing
Nixon's opinion.
   `It's our contention that the statute is constitutional,'' he
said. ``We intend to pursue the case to that end.''
   Catalano also said the case could be affected by an upcoming
ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on a Missouri law that restricts
the availability of abortions and defines life as beginning at
conception. The justices could rule Monday or order another round of
arguments, delaying the decision until next year.
   ``If they rule, we'll read it with interest,'' Catalano said.
   Lynn Ray, executive director of Tennessee Volunteers for Life,
said his citizens' group, which lobbied for the 1988 legislation,
may ask the General Assembly to pass a new version of the parental
consent law next year.
   The law would have made it a misdemeanor for a doctor to perform
an abortion on a girl under age 18 without obtaining written
permission from both her parents or her legal guardian.
   The statute allows exceptions, however, if the parents are
divorced; if the pregnant girl wins a court waiver of the consent
requirement; or if one parent cannot be found ``within a reasonable
time and manner.''
   ``The phrase `reasonable time and manner' is so vague as to fail
to give the physician notice as to when his actions will violate the
statute and subject him to criminal sanctions,'' the judge said.
That violates the doctor's right to due process under the 14th
Amendment, he said.
   Nixon said uncertainty about the law's meaning would lead doctors
to protect themselves by denying abortions to minors who can't
locate one of their parents.
   ``The judge ruled on every single ground on which we alleged the
law was unconstitutional,'' said Dara Klassel, attorney for Planned
Parenthood.
   Two cases pending before the Supreme Court involve parental
consent laws in Ohio and Minnesota.
   The Ohio abortion law generally requires doctors to notify a
parent before performing an abortion on a young, unmarried girl.
Passed by the state Legislature in 1985, the Ohio law never took
effect due to a successful legal challenge by an Akron abortion
clinic and one of its doctors.
   The Minnesota law requires some girls to tell both parents at
least 48 hours before having an abortion. A federal appeals court
upheld the law, but postponed its ruling's effect while the Supreme
Court reviewed it.
   According to court papers, parental notification or consent laws
are in effect in Alabama, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Missouri, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah and West Virginia.
   A challenge to a Florida parental consent law is under
consideration by that state's Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Court Lifts Ban on Justice Department Drug Testing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has lifted a ban on
drug testing for Justice Department employees who have top-secret
security clearances.
   However, the court Friday left intact a permanent injunction on
random drug testing for Justice Department lawyers responsible for
conducting grand jury proceedings and employees who prosecute
criminal cases.
   The court suggested that the department consider limiting testing
to personnel who handle drug prosecutions.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the department would
consider seeking further court review of ``parts of the opinion with
which we disagree'' or to refocus the program.
   The department's plans for random drug testing covered about
1,300 employees with top-secret clearances, as well as about 400
criminal prosecutors and 750 personnel with access to grand jury
information.
   In a decision written by Chief U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
Judge Patricia Wald, the court rejected the department's request to
lift the injunction issued by a federal district court last summer.
   The injunction resulted from a lawsuit by 38 Justice Department
attorneys.

   An American diplomat has been ordered to leave
Czechoslovakia for what communist authorities said was his
participation in public demonstrations, the State Department says.
   While rejecting the charges against Robert Norman, a political
officer in charge of monitoring human rights, the department said
his ouster was a ``clear-cut case'' of retaliation for the expulsion
last week of a Czechoslovak diplomat here.
   ``Despite Mr. Norman's expulsion, we will continue to monitor
carefully the human rights situation in Czechoslovakia,'' the
department said in a statement issued Friday.
   The Czechoslovak diplomat, Jan Fejgl, a first secretary at the
Czechoslovak Embassy here, had been caught in an act of espionage,
the statement said.
   Norman, who was due to leave Prague for another assignment in
about a month, was accused of acting in a manner inconsistent with
Czechoslovak law.
   The State Department disagreed. ``Mr. Norman acted at all times
in accordance with internationally accepted diplomatic practice,''

<NOTE>IRS Proposes Changes, Asks Public Comment</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has proposed
several changes designed to improve 1989 individual income tax forms.
   The IRS on Friday also announced new forms for reporting
children's investment income and additional capital gains.
   It is the third year the IRS has released the new forms and asked
the public to comment and offer suggestions.
   One new form, numbered 8814, would allow parents to report on
their own tax return the investment income of dependent children
under 14. Last year, such children with investment income over
$1,000 were required to file their own returns and were taxed at
their parents' rate.
   The IRS also plans a new Schedule D-1, a continuation sheet for
Schedule D that can be used to list additional capital gains and
losses.

<HEAD>New York Legislature Lets Staten Island Vote on Secession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York state's Legislature voted today to
let Staten Island residents vote on whether they want to secede from
New York City and form their own government.
   Residents of the smallest of New York City's five boroughs can
vote in November 1990 if the bill is signed by Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The bill allowing the secession vote passed the state Assembly
early today by a 116-22 vote after passing the state Senate.
   Cuomo has not indicated how he will act on the measure, said his
spokesman, Gary Fryer.
   The secession movement gathered force earlier this year after the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the city's Board of Estimate was
unconstitutional because it gave Staten Island, with fewer than
400,000 residents, equal representation with Brooklyn, the most
populous borough with more than 2.2 million residents.
   The restructuring being prepared under the ruling could diminish
Staten Island's voice in city government.
   The other New York boroughs are Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx.

   A Roman Catholic priest who celebrated his last
Mass as an inner-city pastor said he saw a new beginning in the
merger of his church with another one closed by the Detroit
Archdiocese.
   Rev. Edward J. Farrell is losing his post at St. Agnes Church
because it is merging with St. Theresa, a 300-member parish two
miles away. St. Theresa closed its doors Friday, the 17th church to
shut down as part of the Archdiocese's plan to close 30 inner-city
churches.
   Farrell ended his 12-year pastoral duties at St. Agnes Friday
amid tears of joy and sorrow from about 20 parishioners. Although he
said he was sorry to leave, Farrell said he was encouraged about the
new start for the church, founded in 1914.
   ``Today's mass was a joyful occasion,'' said Farrell, who will
become a director at the Institute of Ministry at the nearby Sacred
Heart Seminary. ``It is an ending and a new beginning for all.''
   The new parish, as yet unnamed, will celebrate its first joint
Mass Sunday.
   At least one parishioner was angry.
   ``I disagree strongly with the closings, and especially with the
way it's being handled,'' said Patricia Dorsey, a parishioner for 5
years. ``The Roman Catholic Church needs smaller bases such as this
one to have a greater affect on the surrounding community.''
   Dorsey was among the throng of Catholics who packed a courtroom
Wednesday when Circuit Judge James Hathaway refused to block the
closings. The group took its plea for an injunction to the state
Appeals Court on Friday. The court isn't expected to rule before the
middle of next week.
   Ernie Haywood said the merger will allow the parish to survive on
its own collections.
   ``We have been depending on the cardinal to keep the doors to our
church open, now we can become a viable part of the community,''
said Haywood.

   A mother's line drive during a baseball
outing with her family proved fatal to her 6-year-old son when the
ball struck him in the chest and stopped his heart, officials said.
   Brien Patrick Ryan was pronounced dead Thursday night after being
struck by the baseball in the game in the Denver suburb. An autopsy
showed he died of acute heart failure due to arrhythmia _ an
alteration in the rhythm of the heartbeat _ from blunt trauma,
officials said.
   ``He put his glove up. He missed it,'' said his father, Pat Ryan.
``The ball hit his chest. I heard a thump. He turned around and
looked at me.''
   Ryan, standing behind to coach him, grabbed his son and ran for
help. The boy was airlifted to St. Anthony Hospital Central, where
he was pronounced dead.
   Police spokesman Merle Westling termed the death ``a real freak
thing.''
   Experts agreed.
   ``For it to cause a death is very rare,'' said Dr. David Clarke,
chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center.

<HEAD>Dialysis Machine Keeps Marcos Alive</HEAD>

   Ferdinand Marcos' fever has subsided but doctors
say they can't tell yet whether his condition has improved after an
operation to remove his transplanted kidney.
   The former Philippines president was being kept alive by daily
dialysis treatments, which do the job of his failed kidneys and
extract waste from the blood, Eugene Tiwanak, assistant
administrator at St. Francis Medical Center, said Friday.
   The operation was performed Thursday because doctors believed
Marcos' life-threatening fever of up to 104 degrees was caused by
his body's rejection of the donated kidney he received in 1984.
   Marcos' temperature subsided to around 100 degrees, but he
remained semicomatose and was unable to recognize people, Tiwanak
said.
   ``The doctors feel it's too soon to say there has been an overall
improvement in his condition as a result of the surgery,'' said
Tiwanak. Marcos was still in very critical condition and the
prognosis remained poor, he said.
   Earlier, Marcos spokesman Roger Peyuan said three doctors told
Imelda Marcos her husband was slightly better following surgery.
   ``He's a little better. Just so-so. Still very critical,'' Mrs.
Marcos said as she left the hospital early Friday morning.
   But she was unresponsive to reporters when she returned to the
hospital Friday night. When asked how her husband was doing, Mrs.
Marcos said she was at the hospital to sign a release for Marcos'
medication.
   Tiwanak said Marcos could survive indefinitely with the use of a
dialysis machine. Marcos also was hooked up to a resirator and other
life-support equipment, Tiwanak said.
   Marcos suffered liver failure Wednesday, and suffered heart, lung
and kidney failure in May. He has remained in the hospital since
being admitted Jan. 15.
   One of Marcos' doctors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said the exiled leader's condition has generally worsened over the
past five months.
   ``It's like a stair step,'' the doctor said. ``He gets worse,
levels off, gets worse and levels offs, but sooner or later he'll
fall off the steps.''
   Another doctor, also speaking on the condition of anonymity,
called Marcos' survival remarkable.
   ``He really does have a tremendous will to live,'' the doctor
said. ``I can honestly say that just about any other person in his
condition would have been dead months ago. There's no real
explanation.''
   The Marcoses were indicted in New York last year on federal
racketeering charges. They stand accused of stealing more than $100
million from their homeland to buy art and real estate in Manhattan.
   Marcos' illness has led him to be separated from the case. Mrs.
Marcos is free on $5 million bail.
   The couple fled here in 1986 when a popular revolt swept Corazon
Aquino into the presidency. She has refused Marcos' many requests
for permission to return home.

<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens looking for books at the
Moscow library where Lenin, Dostoyevsky and Chekhov once studied
will soon be using computers programmed at a Virginia university.
   Virginia Tech Library Systems President Vinod Chachra sees it as
more than a technical challenge to computerize the card catologue of
the massive Lenin Library. The project will encourage the Soviet
policy of openness, or glasnost, and help further business relations
between the superpowers, he says.
   ``This is really opening up access to information,'' Chachra
said. ``In one sense, this is bringing in more equality with the
technology. By automating the system, it greatly increases the
access to all people.''
   Chachra's company, which is controlled by a non-profit arm of
Virginia Tech, announced last month that the Soviets had chosen its
software system to automate their national library. Chachra will
meet with the library's director, Nikolai Semyonovich Kartashov, in
Blacksburg on July 18 to discuss the start of the project in
November.
   The work is expected to take up to four years and cost $1
million, he said.
   The Lenin Library, located just off Red Square, has 35 million
books in 247 languages and 3,000 employees. Its 18 reading rooms,
many of them with ornate, high ceilings and lit by chandeliers, seat
more than 2,300 people and are visited by more than 7,000 readers
each day.
   In comparison, the Library of Congress in Washington has 26
million books and the New York Public Library has 6 million books,
Chachra said.
   The library was founded in 1862 as the Rumiantsev Library, named
after a count whose collection accounted for most of its original
holdings. It was renamed in 1925 after the father of the Russian
revolution.
   In addition to Lenin, famous Russians who have studied in the
library include authors Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Anton
Chekhov.
   Chachra visited the library during a recent five-day trip to
Moscow.
   ``I was struck by the number of people waiting outside the door
for the library to open,'' he said. ``There aren't that many
libraries in the Soviet Union. The users are dedicated.''
   They have to be. Checking out a book is a lengthy and frustrating
process, and just finding the right card catalog file is an ordeal
because there are separate catalogs for various subcollections,
Chachra said.
   After finding the right catalogue, the user must write the title
and author on a slip of paper and stand in line for up to an hour to
give the note to a circulation clerk. The clerk sends the note to
the book retrieval area via pneumatic tubes.
   ``It can take anywhere from a half a day to five days to get a
book,'' Chachra said. ``Occasionally, the book has been lent to
someone else, and after waiting that long you find out you can't get
it anyway.''
   Under the planned automated system, people looking for a book
will step up to a U.S.-made computer running on software designed by
Chachra and his staff. For many, it will be their first experience
with a personal computer, Chachra said.
   Users will be able to make a book request directly from a
terminal and find out right away whether the book is checked out,
Chachra said.
   The current system restricts access to information because of its
cumbersome nature, Chachra said, but that will change.
   ``By the nature of the technology, it will be in favor of the
user,'' he said. ``The software is designed for open access.''
   Chachra said it remains to be seen whether Soviet officials will
give access to some books that are now off limits to users,
presumably for political reasons.
   The Lenin Library will be the first Soviet library to
computerize, but it will be the sixth national library to automate
with software from Virginia Tech Library Systems. The company has
computerized the National Gallery of Art Library and the National
Agricultural Library in the United States, as well as libraries in
Scotland, Malaysia and Finland.
   The company has computerized nearly 100 other libraries,
including that of the U.S. Supreme Court.

   Shen Tong, one of the student leaders being
sought by Chinese authorities for their part in the pro-democracy
movement, says he intends to carry on fighting for democratic
reforms in exile.
   ``This movement for democracy has won a complete victory,'' said
Shen, 20, who escaped China and landed in this country June 11.
``It's a grand scale self-education of what democracy really is. ...
The seeds of democracy have been sown.''
   The lanky, self-assured fugitive, who is now studying biology at
Brandeis University, broke a self-imposed silence Friday and gave an
interview before holding a press conference in which he declared the
Chinese student movement victorious.
   Shen was among five executive members of an organizing committee
for the April 27 demonstration at Beijing University, where he was a
student. The demonstration was staged in response to a critical
editorial the previous day in The People's Daily.
   Shen was also a founder and leader of the Beijing Area Colleges'
Dialogue Delegation, which tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with
Chinese Premier Li Peng on May 18 on conditions for the students to
leave the square they occupied for weeks until troops moved in.
   He was about one mile from Tiananmen Square June 4, the day
Chinese troops bore down with tanks and guns on the demonstrators.
Although the protest focused on the square, the killing of thousands
occurred throughout the streets of the city, Shen said.
   Men standing beside him were shot dead, one man through the head.
He saw tanks bearing down on an angry, disbelieving throng.
   ``Beijing people were very brave,'' Shen said. ``They didn't
leave the street but walked around the bodies and in front of the
soldiers. All of the soldiers were crazy, shooting people.''
   Shen escaped China under circumstances he refused to reveal.
   Several other leaders of the democracy movement escaped,
including Wu'er Kaixi, a top student leader; Yan Jiaqi and Su
Shaozhi, leading dissident intellectuals; and Wan Runnan, head of
China's first private high tech company, Stone Corp.
   Shen had already won a place as a Wien scholar at Brandeis before
the massacre.
   During the interview Friday, he wore a blood red T-shirt bearing
the black outline of the Goddess of Democracy, the plastic likeness
of the Statue of Liberty the student demonstrators erected in
Tiananmen Square.
   Shen said he intends to continue to work for the democratic
reform of his homeland.
   ``We have to try our best,'' Shen said. ``This movement is still
a movement.''

   A chartered bus clipped the rear of a
tractor-trailer and overturned, injuring 42 passengers, police said.
   The bus, taking a New York church group to Disney World in
Orlando, Fla., hit the truck Friday afternoon while trying to pass
on Interstate 85, said state Trooper D.W. Ezell. The bus crossed the
lane, went off the shoulder and flipped on its side.
   ``It was scary,'' said passenger James Harrington, 16. ``We hit
the truck and the bus rocked this way, and that way, and then, bam,
we were over the side.''
   Ezell said the bus driver, Jesse Bookhart of Bloomfield, N.J.,
was charged with reckless driving.
   The bus, which had 47 people aboard, was traveling at 65 mph when
it hit the United Van Lines truck, the trooper said. The accident
occurred one day before the state raised the speed limit for buses
on rural interstates from 55 mph to 65 mph.
   A side of the bus was ripped open, and clothes and other personal
belongings were strewn along the highway. The interstate was closed
for about 3{ hours after the accident, which occurred about 50 miles
south of Richmond.
   All of the injured were taken to Community Memorial Hospital in
South Hill, said hospital administrator John M. Faulkner.
   Faulkner said one person was admitted to Community Memorial for
observation and three were transferred to the Medical College of
Virginia Hospital in Richmond for treatment of broken bones. The
others, who had injuries ranging from bloody noses to scrapes and
cuts, were treated and released.
   Bob Maslen of the Brunswick Volunteer Rescue Squad, who was on
the first of 10 ambulances that responded to the accident, said the
passengers ``had helped each other out of the bus. I think they were
worried about the fire hazard. They were helping each other. They
knew not to move the injured too much and were making shade.''
   The bus was one of two chartered buses that left Rush Temple
A.M.E. Zion Church in New York's Queens borough Friday morning, said
Dorothy Midgett, a passenger on the second bus that was about 20
minutes behind the vehicle that crashed.
   Officials were making arrangements for another bus for passengers
who wanted to continue the trip.

<TEXT>
   Tiananmen Square re-opened to the public today,
almost four weeks after army tanks stormed the grounds in a violent
suppression of China's pro-democracy movement.
   Hundreds of people who had obtained special permission filed
through the vast square in orderly lines, peering first at the
Forbidden City's Gate of Heavenly Peace and then at the few soldiers
who patroled the square.
   Eight police guards with new weapons meanwhile stood around the
U.S. Embassy as diplomats and U.S. citizens took part in an annual
Fourth of July party.
   The eight with submachine guns were People's Armed Police
regularly assigned to the embassy, a diplomat inside the compound
said.
   ``Same guys, different guns,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on
condition he not be identified by name.
   PAP officers with pistols normally stand guard at foreign
embassies. It was not immediately clear why these guards were
re-armed.
   The appearance of guards carrying more powerful weapons sparked
some fears because of strained relations in recent weeks between
Washington and Beijing over the military crackdown and the status of
a leading Chinese dissident, astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, who has
taken refuge at the U.S. mission.
   Elsewhere, hundreds of cheerful tourists gathered on the rostrum
above the Gate of Heavenly Peace, where Mao Tse-tung declared the
founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1, 1949.
   There was no sign of the terror and grief that engulfed Tiananmen
June 3-4, when the People's Liberation Army stormed the square,
shooting its way through hundreds of thousands of unarmed protesters.
   The government says about 300 people were killed, half of them
soldiers. Chinese witnesses and Western diplomats say the deaths
were in the thousands.
   Foreign tourists today paid 30 yuan ($8.10) while Chinese paid
$2.70, two days' wages for many workers, to stand atop the gate.
   Visitors from Liaoning, Sichuan, Shandong and Hubei provinces
snapped away with their cameras. Most said they had not heard of the
deaths during the military crackdown.
   Some crowded to get an autograph of Wang Fuyi, one of the martial
law commanders who brought troops to quell what the Chinese
government has called a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' last
month. Others jostled each other to seek an autograph of Zhang
Baifa, vice mayor of Beijing.
   Groups of a dozen soldiers with AK-47 rifles marched by the gate
every minute.
   Tiananmen opened a day after former Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang was stripped of his last government title.
   Zhao, ousted as party general secretary a week ago, was dismissed
by senior leader Deng Xiaoping as vice chairman of the State Central
Military Commission. Deng is chairman of the commission.
   Zhao, a moderate, was effectively ousted more than a month ago,
after he paid a tearful visit on May 19 to students on a hunger
strike in Tiananmen. He has not been seen since.
   President Yang Shangkun, who spent his career in the military,
reportedly was seeking to replace Zhao on the commission. The
commission's senior vice chairman is second to Deng in the
government's military command.

   Revlon also said Friday that it will not contract with
independent laboratories that use animals to test product safety.
   Actress Doris Day, a leading animal rights activist, praised
Revlon's decision. Avon made similar concessions last week.
   ``This is so exciting. We are finally making major strides and
headway,'' Day said. ``I salute Revlon and some of the other

animals from needless pain and torture.''
   Revlon said that instead of animal testing it will rely on the

regulations.
   Revlon said it already had sharply reduced its testing
requirements prior to the announcement.

   Strong thunderstorms moved across parts of Nebraska and Kansas
today, while heavy rains soaked parts of Texas and Florida.
   An upper air disturbance moving through the central Plains
produced thunderstorm winds gusting up to 66 mph at Goodland, Kan.
Winds from 70 to 80 mph were reported at Downs, Kan. A flash flood
watch was in effect for eastern and north-central Kansas.
   Golf ball-size hail fell from a thunderstorm near McCook, Neb.
   A cold front produced thunderstorms over the northern Rockies. In
Montana, dime-size hail pelted Superior and winds gusted to 62 mph
in the Polson area.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued from eastern Texas across
northern Louisiana and Arkansas into southern Missouri. The rain was
associated with a low pressure area over north-central Texas that
once was Tropical Storm Allison.
   More than 4 inches of rain fell across Grimes County, Texas,
early Friday evening, causing some creeks and streams to overflow.
   Flash flood watches were in effect across eastern Texas, western
Louisiana and southern Arkansas.
   Thunderstorms over the Florida Peninsula and the eastern Gulf
Coast also dumped heavy rain.
   Showers and thunderstorms were diminishing early today across
southeast Minnesota and west-central Wisconsin. An upper air low
pressure system off the northern Pacific Coast continued to produce
showers across the Pacific Northwest.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included nearly 2 inches at Tallahassee, Fla, 1} inches at Memphis
and 1\ inches at New Orleans.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms over
Florida, the southern Appalachians, much of the Gulf Coast, the
lower Mississippi Valley, the Tennessee Valley and the lower
Missouri Valley; and scattered showers across the northern Pacific
Coast and parts of northern New England.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s and 70s over much of New
England, parts of the upper Mississippi Valley, parts of the
northern Rockies, the Pacific Northwest and along the California
coast; in the 90s over the central and southern Rockies, western
parts of the central and southern Plains and inland parts of
California; in the 100s from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas to the
desert Southwest; and in the 80s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41

<HEAD>State Elections in Michoacan to Test Mexico's Governing Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MORELIA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party and its leftist opposition face an unusual test Sunday _
whether the Michoacan state legislative elections will be clean.
   The pre-election rhetoric has been harsh as both sides have
poured money and energy into the race in this western Mexico farming
state.
   The governing party, known by its Spanish initials PRI, has been
in power in Mexico for 60 years and has often been accused of
winning elections through fraud.
   The leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, founded earlier this
year by native son Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, has been saying Sunday's
balloting will likely be rife with vote-tampering.
   ``The PRI and fraud are synonymous,'' Democratic Revolutionary
Sen. Roberto Robles Garnica told a news conference Friday.
   The state Electoral Commission, controlled by PRI, has called out
the army to guard the polls. Robles and other Democratic
Revolutionary leaders said the move is an attempt to intimidate
voters by ``fabricating a specter of violence.''
   However, top PRI officials say there may indeed be violence and
call the troop deployment a preventive measure. ``This isn't a
ghost; it's reality,'' one of them, Jorge Medina Viedas, said in an
interview.
   In addition, legislative elections will be held Sunday in
Zacatecas, Chihuahua, Campeche, and Baja California state, which
will also elect a governor and mayors. Fair balloting is also at
issue in the other states.
   Much attention has focused on Michoacan, which is seen as a key
contest.
   In the last election in 1986, the PRI won 18 of 24 seats in
Michoacan's single-house legislature, and four small opposition
parties took the rest.
   But in July last year, Cardenas polled 64 percent of Michoacan's
vote in the presidential election, and his coalition's candidates
took both Senate seats and 12 of the state's 13 national Chamber of
Deputies from the PRI.
   Although Cardenas came in second behind President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari nationwide, it was a stunning blow for the PRI in the
state.
   In addition, Cardenas supporters mounted sit-ins last December at
about half the state's 113 city and town halls to demand the ouster
of Gov. Luis Martinez Villacana. They accused him of corruption.
   The protests prompted him to quit and take a job as director of
the Federal Toll Highways and Bridges Administration. Several PRI
mayors also resigned.
   The new governor, Genovevo Figuero Zamudio, issued a statement
Friday promising ``honest, free, clean and safe'' elections. He said
the party had overhauled its leadership and image.
   As part of that new image, the PRI for the first time put forward
candidates in open convention. However, they were then nominated by
party leaders behind closed doors.
   Despite PRI's efforts, opposition representatives are still
complaining of purported irregularities in voter registration rolls
and screening of poll watchers.
   The conservative National Action Party, weaker in this state, is
also fielding candidates.
   About 1.5 million voters are expected to cast ballots at 2,330
polling stations in this state from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday.
Official results are expected a week later.

<HEAD>Feds Probe Camden Housing Agency, Florio Camp Cries `Politics'</HEAD>

   Federal investigators are probing
allegations that a development agency used federal housing funds to
finance campaigns of local Democratic officials, a newspaper
reported.
   At least five federal investigators Thursday night searched the
home of Bernard C. Madrack, chief operating officer of the Greater
Camden Development Corp., and seized 34 boxes of records, The
Philadelphia Inquirer reported in today's editions.
   The now-disbanded corporation was a non-profit agency that
processed federal housing money from 1983 to 1986.
   Hours after subpoenas were issued Friday in the probe, Rep. James
Florio, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, called for a speedy
investigation and suggested Republicans initiated the inquiry for
political purposes.
   Camden County is Florio's political base and the agency under
investigation was run by Democratic leaders with ties to Florio.
Madrack spent seven years on Florio's staff.
   County Freeholder Michael J. DiPiero, a Republican, prompted the
investigation by writing HUD Inspector General Paul Adams and
alleging widespread abuse of HUD funds and criminal activity at the
agency, the Inquirer reported.
   Investigators said Florio was not a target of the investigation
and there was no evidence of his personal involvement, The New York
Times reported in today's editions. The investigators said Florio's
political organization in Camden County and a number of his
associates are under scrutiny, the newspaper said.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said his office is probing various
HUD matters in New Jersey, but would not comment.
   Florio said he received a telephone call Friday evening from
Alito confirming the Camden probe, but said there were no individual
targets.
   The investigation comes as a congressional panel is looking into
possible influence peddling and misuse of funds at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development by prominent Republicans during the
Reagan administration.
   DiPiero and Michael Leonard, a former employee of the development
agency, told investigators at least $30,000 in federal money may
have been diverted to Democratic campaigns, the Inquirer reported,
citing unidentified officials familiar with the probe.
   DiPiero also told investigators some HUD money was used by agency
employees to buy cocaine, the Inquirer reported.
   The Times said investigators were probing allegations that money
was diverted to Democratic campaigns and used for personal reasons,
including vacations.
   Madrack's attorney, Charles N. Riley, said his client was told he
is not a target of the investigation. The documents were in his home
because he is their legal custodian, he said.
   Florio noted the disclosure of the Camden investigation followed
by days the resignations of two top advisers to the Republican
nominee for governor, Rep. Jim Courter, because of their ties to the
HUD scandal.
   The two events ``are so coincidental ... that I cannot help but
wonder if there are political motivations involved in the leaks,''
Florio said. He demanded federal officials determine how news of the
investigation was leaked.
   Political strategist Roger Stone stepped down from the Courter
campaign earlier this week after a partner in his firm, Black,
Manafort Stone and Kelly, acknowledged the firm received more than
$300,000 to obtain nearly $31 million in HUD funds for a Seabrook
housing project that was opposed by local officials.
   Media analyst Greg Stevens, who also resigned, has said he made a
telephone call to connect Stone's firm with state housing officials.
   Courter spokesman Gordon Hensley said the campaign was not
involved in starting the Camden investigation.

<HEAD>Passengers Balk at Reboarding Problem-Filled Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of vacationers on a trip from
Britain to Hawaii endured hours of delay, a malfunction that forced
their plane to dump its fuel, an unscheduled stop and a fire on
their bus.
   Hot under the collar, 53 of them finally just said ``no'' and
refused to head for home Friday night on the same chartered plane
that spilled its fuel into the Pacific Ocean earlier this week.
   ``I value my life more than I want to get on that plane,'' said
Joanna Harris-Brown, a travel consultant from Liberpool, England.
   She was among 480 passengers on the U.S. Orion Airlines Boeing
747 that dumped fuel en route back to Manchester, England, and
landed Thursday night at the Edmonton International Airport after a
loss of oil pressure in the engines.
   On their way to the flight home Friday night, their bus caught
fire. A passing fire truck put out the blaze, which was blamed on a
leak of power-steering fluid.
   The mishap was another in a series of incidents and
inconveniences to plague the passengers from the moment they began
their trip two weeks ago.
   Before leaving Manchester, they were delayed more than an hour.
They waited 16 hours to board in Honolulu on the return flight.
   After the oil pressure problem forced the plane down, the
passengers once again waited five hours because they were told
customs officials had not arrived.
   Many were openly hostile when a representative for the British
consulate broke the news Friday night they would be leaving on the
same plane.
   ``It's been repaired four times by competent engineers, and it's
still not working,'' claimed passenger Malcolm Fletcher from
Birmingham, England.
   ``I'm frightened to take my 1-year-old son on the plane,'' he
said. ``We're going over the Atlantic next; that's what frightens
me.''
   The plane was scheduled to leave today with those passengers
willing to board.

<HEAD>Mollusks to Monitor North Sea Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEN HELDER, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The humble mussel, a tidal water
delicacy, is now playing a pivotal role in monitoring pollution in
the North Sea.
   Spread over 15 locations along the Dutch coast, 1,500 of the
jet-black mollusks were put into service this week as a way
scientists can check the flow of poisonous waste through the North
Sea, one of the most heavily polluted basins in the world, a project
spokesman said Friday.
   In filtering algae from sea water for food, the bivalves also
store poisonous waste and heavy metals. A look at what they have
stored gives a picture of the quality of water they live in.
   ``They give us a perfect overview of the water quality over the
time span involved,'' said Martin Scholten, a spokesman for the
government project.
   The mussels live in plastic baskets attached to shipping buoys up
to six miles off the coast. They will be checked in three six-week
periods over a year at a cost of $113,600.
   ``Mussels are ideal for this kind of job because they filter so
much water,'' Scholten said. The average mussel processes about 13
gallons of sea water a day, he said.

<HEAD>Puerto Rican Nationalist Says Flag Decision Should Erase His Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jailed Puerto Rican nationalist has filed a
petition for freedom under a Supreme Court decision he claims
condones his burning of an American flag two years ago.
   In what may be the first direct result of last week's court
decision, Carlos Mendoza-Lugo, an inmate at the U.S. penitentiary in
Atlanta, filed a petition in federal court Friday demanding the
government show cause for keeping him in prison.
   Mendoza-Lugo burned a flag in front of a U.S. post office in
Puerto Rico in 1987, as a protest for Puerto Rican independence.
   ``It wasn't an act of vandalism; I was protesting,'' said
Mendoza-Lugo, 36. ``It's unconstitutional for me to be in jail when
I was making use of my freedom of speech.''
   A lawyer in the Supreme Court case said Mendoza-Lugo was the
first jailed flag-burner to seek freedom since the high court issued
the June 21 decision.
   ``This guy should not be in jail any longer if that's (flag
burning) the basis for his conviction,'' said lawyer David Cole, who
represented flag-burner Gregory Johnson in the Texas vs. Johnson
case.
   The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Johnson, saying the
Constitution's guarantee of free speech protects people who burn the
flag as a form of political protest.
   In response to the ruling, President Bush this week began
pressing for a constitutional amendment prohibiting desecration of
the American flag.
   The number of people in jail for flag-burning is so small that
the federal Bureau of Prisons doesn't keep statistics on it.
   Mendoza-Lugo pleaded guilty to flag desecration and began serving
a maximum one-year sentence last December. A staff member for the
Puerto Rican magistrate handling the case said Mendoza-Lugo's
sentence was shortened recently to seven months, making him eligible
for release this month.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested more than 200 people on drug,
weapons and other charges in the year's first sweep of gang-infested
areas, and they promised to keep up the pressure over the holiday
weekend.
   The latest dragnet ``is to let the gang members know they are not
going to control the streets,'' said police Lt. Jim Tatreau, who
organized the eight-hour sweep that ended early today.
   Some 235 people, 136 of them reputed gang members, were arrested
during the sweep of the city's south side, said Teri Dixon, a police
analyst who recorded the arrests. The number far exceeded the 150
that Tatreau had projected.
   ``We expect tomorrow night to be even a little busier,'' Ms.
Dixon said. ``We'll see.''
   Forty-nine arrests were for felony narcotics violations and two
were for misdemeanor narcotics violations.
   Other arrests involved such things as weapons charges,
outstanding felony warrants and driving under the influence, Ms.
Dixon said.
   Portable booking trailers were set up at the Police Department's
Southeast Division station in the heart of the impoverished Watts
district, the site of deadly riots in 1965.
   The effort represented the first massive dragnet aimed at
drug-dealing street thugs since last summer's highly publicized
``Hammer'' sweeps, which also targeted the city's drug- and
gang-infested south side.
   The sweeps will resume again this evening and continue through
the holiday weekend, with police shifting their focus west toward
beach communities as the weekend progresses, officials said.
   ``Nice people will be going to the beach. We're trying to keep
the dirt bags away,'' said Detective Tony Celli.
   Despite last year's sweeps, the number of gang-related slayings
increased to 452 in Los Angeles County last year from 387 in 1987.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 10th graf to RESTORE first reference to Whitten.</HEAD>

   The tanker that spilled 420,000 gallons
of heating oil into Narragansett Bay was released for repairs and
the ship's Greek captain was freed on $50,000 bail.
   Earlier Friday, a helmsman aboard the tanker told a federal
inquiry board he saw a warning buoy on the wrong side of the ship
before it ran aground, but he didn't warn the captain.
   The ship's chief mate praised the captain as one of the best to
work for and apologized for the spill, which scientists said caused
less environmental damage than first feared.
   Meanwhile, officials in New Jersey prepared to lift a state of
emergency on the oil-soiled Delaware River, where a tanker spilled
an estimated 300,000 gallons of heating oil after running aground
last weekend.
   In Providence, Federal Magistrate Jacob Hagopian late Friday
released the World Prodigy. Hagopian said his order would contain a
provision that the ship be towed.
   Lt. Paul Wolf said the Coast Guard expected to release the ship
today to New York Shipyard, which runs a yard in New York City.
Divers discovered the ship had a gash on either side, extending as
long as 200 feet down the 560-foot vessel.
   The magistrate also freed Captain Iakovos Georgudis, 43, after
the ship's owners wired $50,000 bail. Georgudis had been confined
aboard the ship and faces two misdemeanor charges he violated
pollution laws.
   Helmsman Konstadinos A. Paraskevopulos, speaking through an
interpreter, said he saw the red buoy marking the reef ``a little to
the left'' as the tanker headed into the harbor.
   Warning buoys should be kept on the right for ships entering a
harbor, but Paraskevopulos said nothing about warning the captain.
   Given the discipline on board the ship, ``The helmsman wouldn't
dare make any suggestion to the master,'' Coast Guard Capt. David H.
Whitten said.
   Human error was ``a pretty good conclusion,'' said Whitten, who
ran the board of inquiry with two National Transportation Safety
Board investigators.
   Whitten said it would be six months before he finished a final
report, and NTSB investigators said theirs could take as long as
nine months. Whitten said the biggest gap was lack of testimony from
the captain.
   Testimony at the hearing showed that harbor pilots often board
ships well past the point where state law requires them to board.
   The chief mate, Georgios Vlahos, showed investigators a symbol on
a British chart that corresponded to a pick-up point for harbor
pilots that was inside the line set by the state. The World Prodigy
was well inside that line and had no pilot on board when it grounded.
   Vlahos also apologized for the accident.
   ``I am very sorry for this happening. I don't know what else to
say. I think it was a very bad time and all else is in your hands,''
he told the board.
   Paraskevopulos said the captain was tied up with radio traffic to
the harbor pilot just before the grounding.
   The two men testified under federal immunity. Vlahos also
testified before a grand jury investigating possible violations of
the state's harbor pilot and pollution laws.
   State, federal and University of Rhode Island scientists said
there apparently had been little permanent environmental damage.
About 150 young lobsters, 500 crabs, 15 birds and numerous mussels
have died, they said, but most small animals critical to the food
chain, such as zooplankton, survived.
   In New Jersey, the tanker Presidente Rivera leaked up to 1,500
barrels more oil while being cleaned and emptied, but officials said
most of the oil was mopped up with a boom and a skimmer.
   Officials anticipated lifting the emergency status from the
Delaware River over the weekend.

<HEAD>Long Island Town Reportedly Cancels HUD-Financed Swimming Pool</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A seaside Long Island village is scrapping plans
to build a swimming pool and will return $1 million to the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development that had granted for the
project, a newspaper reported today.
   Officials in Island Park requested earlier this week that their
application for the pool be withdrawn, citing local opposition to
the project and rising costs, The New York Times reported.
   The officials denied the cancellation was a response to a federal
inquiry into HUD-sponsored projects on Long Island, the newspaper
said.
   Island Park was awarded the funds for the pool last year after
Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, a village resident, personally lobbied
then-HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce.
   The funds came from Pierce's discretionary fund. In a letter to
village residents last fall, D'Amato praised Pierce's ``wise
decision to approve this grant.''
   An assistant to HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said Kemp was pleased the
pool project was dead.
   ``We think the funds can be used for a purpose that will be more
in line with assisting low-income individuals,'' said Mary Brunette.
   The Times reported that telephone calls to D'Amato's office
Friday afternoon were not answered.
   Federal investigators are looking into allegations that
HUD-sponsored houses went to politically connected residents in
Island Park instead of minorities, as had been planned.

   The airport in the southern city of Bandar
Abbas will be renamed to honor the passengers on an Iranian airliner
shot down a year ago by the United States, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency said today.
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, did not give the new name for
the international airport.
   All 290 people aboard the Iran Air Airbus en route from Bandar
Abbas to Dubai across the Persian Gulf were killed on July 3, 1988,
when the plane was shot down by the warship USS Vincennes.
   The Navy said the plane's crew mistook the airline's radar image
for that of an attacking jetfighter.
   The missile attack occurred during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war
when the United States and other Western nations regularly deployed
warships in the gulf to protect neutral shipping. The war ended in a
cease-fire last August.
   The Iranian news agency also said the anniversary of the attack
would be marked Monday with air force and navy planes dropping
flowers in waters where the plane crashed.
   Another ceremony with the families of the victims will take place
in Bandar Abbas, it said.

<TEXT>
   The post-traumatic stress defense used by
some wives accused of killing their husbands also can apply to
juveniles, a judge ruled in finding a teenage girl innocent of
killing her abusive father.
   Attorneys agreed the case set a legal precedent, but 15-year-old
Diana Goodykoontz said she was surprised a judge rejected the
prosecution's claim that she committed murder because she was
influenced by heavy-metal rock 'n' roll music.
   ``I thought they were going to do something to me, anyway, 'cause
... I like the music,'' said Ms. Goodykoontz. ``It's not fair to
judge somebody just because of what they listen to.''
   Circuit Judge John Kuder on Friday ruled that the teen-ager acted
in self defense when she shot her father, Navy Chief Petty Officer
Dennis Goodykoontz, in the family's Pensacola home.
   The judge said Ms. Goodykoontz suffered from battered-child
syndrome, similar to the disorder that afflicts battle-shocked
veterans and wives who have been abused by their husbands. She had a
reasonable belief she was in danger although her father took no
overt physical action just before he was shot with his own handgun,
Kuder said.
   ``I'm unaware of any decision by a judge that's set this
precedent in Florida,'' said Assistant Public Defender Elton Killam,
who represented Ms. Goodykoontz.
   His co-counsel, Paul Mones of Los Angeles who is writing a book
about abused children slaying their parents, said he knew of no
other similar decision by a juvenile court in a non-jury trial, but
he said juvenile court decisions aren't always publicized.
   Kuder also said the state failed to prove any connection between
heavy-metal music and the July 23 shooting. He took nearly two
months to review the case.
   During a four-day, non-jury trial that ended May 4, Ms.
Goodykoontz testified her father had made sexual overtures and she
was afraid he was going to rape her. The judge also heard testimony
that the father had a history of violence against his wife and three
children, including a threat to kill the entire family on the day he
died.

<TEXT>
   Baroness Gaitskell, widow of former Labor Party
leader Hugh Gaitskell, died today in her sleep at home in London.
She was 88.
   Lady Gaitskell, who preferred being called Dora, was born in
Russia but her parents moved the family to London in 1903.
   She joined the Labor Party at 16, met Gaitskell at a by-election
campaign in 1929 and married him in 1937 after divorcing her first
husband.
   He was elected Labor Party leader in 1955 and died in 1963.
   ``Dora Gaitskell was one of those political wives who really
emerged as a political figure in her own right but who provided
essential support and inspiration to her husband,'' said Denis
Healey, a Labor Party lawmaker.
   Lady Gaitskell was made a life peer in 1963 and was known in the
House of Lords as a champion of human rights, reform of the law on
homosexuality, and aid to developing countries.
   She was Britain's delegate to the Human Rights Committee at the
United Nations for four years in the 1960s, and received honorary
degrees from the universities of Manchester and Leeds.
   She is survived by two daughters by Gaitskell and a son by her
first marriage.

   A judge's decision to award custody of an
orphaned toddler to his mother's longtime female companion angered
the boy's blood relatives, who also had sought custody.
   Susan Bellemare of Duxbury was granted temporary custody of
15-month-old Collin Hamilton by a Vermont probate judge Friday.
   Bellemare was named the boy's guardian in a will left by Susan
Hamilton, the child's mother who died in a car accident in May.
Hamilton's parents are challenging the will, claiming they or
Hamilton's sister, Kathleen, would be a better guardian.
   ``This other Susan, she is not even blood,'' said Tom Hamilton,
Susan's brother, who attended the hearing along with his parents and
sister.
   ``I have been co-parenting Collin,'' Bellemare, 33, told Judge L.
John Cain during the hearing. ``I would parent the child, I would
love him, nurture him.''
   No one involved in the case would characterize the relationship
between the two women, who reportedly exchanged wedding rings. They
were companions for a dozen years, owned a home together and lived
together while raising the baby.
   Hamilton conceived her son by artificial insemination.
   ``We're not trying to cast aspersions on anybody,'' said Patrick
Monaghan Jr., the lawyer for the grandparents. ``The person
forgotten in this proceeding is the child and what is in the best
interests of the child.''
   The boy, dressed in blue denim overalls and placated with cheese
snacks by his grandmother and aunt, was in the courtroom for most of
the hearing.
   Elsa Hamilton, the boy's grandmother, quit her job as a legal
secretary to take care of the child after the car accident that also
injured Bellemare.
   Bellemare told the judge she had unsuccessfully tried to see the
boy at his grandparents' home, but had been prevented from doing so.
   Cain asked Bellemare about her health and ability to raise the
child on her own. Bellemare, who used a cane to walk to the witness
stand, said she saw a doctor two weeks ago and was told ``to get on
with my life.
   ``I'm back at work, I'm driving. I'm back at home and able to
provide for the child,'' she said, adding that the boy would be
tended while she worked by the same woman who has cared for him
since he was an infant.
   In giving Bellemare temporary custody, Cain also allowed the
grandparents visitation rights.
   Attorneys representing he boy's grandparents would not say
whether they planned to appeal the temporary custody order to a
higher court.
   Another hearing was set for August to determine whether
Hamilton's will is valid.

<HEAD>EDs: Tops with 13 grafs to update; further lead prospects uncertain.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush started his long
holiday weekend with a brisk morning jog today, saying he had no
official meetings scheduled during the vacation but added, ``You
know me, I get restless.''
   He said he had a pile of briefing papers to review for his
upcoming summit trip to Europe, which begins July 9 in Poland.
   National Security Council aide Robert Gates was with him for the
five-day stay in Kennebunkport.
   When asked by a reporter who ran with him if he planned to fly in
any other officials, Bush said he had no specific plans to do so.
   ``But you know me,'' he added, ``I get restless.''
   Bush was joined on his early morning run by his daughter, Dorothy
LeBlond, and the first dog, Millie.
   Regarding the first family's well-publicized objections this week
to Washingtonian magazine's characterization of Millie as the
ugliest dog in Washington, the president said he at first thought
magazine editors were joking when he received an apologetic note
from them on Friday.
   But Bush said he wrote a note back and brushed the whole matter
off. He had already sent the publication a photograph of himself
with Millie and her newborn puppies, he said.
   Bush ran for about two miles on dirt roads near his family's
Walker's Point compound. He greeted a few neighbors who were out.
   ``Beautiful day,'' he called out as he passed. He also advised
them not to miss the Fourth of July fireworks that are to be set off
on Monday night, July 3, over Walker's Point.
   Bush said he does not know all the neighbors and remarked on how
many houses had been built in the rustic area since he was a boy,
when there were no houses in the beachfront neighborhood where he
ran.
   After his run, he headed off to the sauna and said he was going
for a swim in the pool, then boating later in the day.
   On Friday night he went out fishing on his boat but had no luck,
he said. His daughter said that was because he steered the boat into
the reeds where her fishing line got caught.
   Bush arrived in this resort town Friday afternoon after wrapping
up a day in which he announced his proposed language for a
constitutional amendment against desecration of the American flag,
spoke at a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Civil Rights
Act, and met with South African anti-apartheid activist Albertina
Sisulu.
   Bush will remain in Kennebunkport until early Wednesday. He has
no public events scheduled, but plans to view the Fourth of July
fireworks display.
   Bush will be back at the White House for only a few days next
week before leaving for Poland on July 9, visiting Eastern Europe as
a prelude to the economic summit of major Western industrialized
nations in Paris.
   In an Independence Day message to the nation released by the
White House Friday, Bush asked ``all Americans to remember the
precious legacy of liberty we enjoy.''
   Kennebunkport was bustling with vacationers as the president
arrived, most of them strolling around the main town square where
boutiques and curio shops abound. A fairly steady stream of cars
drove slowly past the Secret Service checkpoints on the narrow
coastal road that passes Bush's home.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the traveling White House
was prepared to comment on the Supreme Court's scheduled decision
Monday on a landmark abortion case.
   Bush began the Independence Day weekend with a flag-draped event
Friday at the Iwo Jima Memorial of Marines raising the flag during
World War II, where the president pushed for a constitutional
amendment to allow laws against burning the U.S. flag. The Supreme
Court ruled June 21 that the Constitution's freedom-of-speech
guarantees protect people who burn the flag as a form of political
protest.
   The amendment crafted by the White House and Republican
congressional leaders reads: ``The Congress and the states shall
have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the
United States.''
   Critics have said such an amendment would open the door for
erosion of the First Amendment to the Constitution.
   But Bush said, ``This amendment preserves the widest conceivable
range of options for free expression.''

<HEAD>Pravda Says Spy Missed America</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy intelligence analyst who killed himself
after defecting to the Soviet Union had missed his homeland and was
irritated by Moscow's chronic shortages of consumer goods, Pravda
said today.
   But Glenn Michael Souther still asked to be buried in his KGB
officer's uniform, the Communist Party daily said.
   The newspaper described the 32-year-old Souther, who committed
suicide in Moscow on June 22, as a top Soviet spy. It said he had
access to ``the most valuable documents on the top-secret plans for
use of the U.S. Navy in a nuclear war against the Soviet Union and
other socialist countries.
   ``He belonged with such outstanding soldiers of the `invisible
front' as Kim Philby and George Blake,'' Pravda said, naming two
famous British intelligence service operatives who spied for the
Soviets.
   The article did not say how Souther died, but it said colleagues
had noticed his occasional bouts of depression but never thought it
could lead to suicide.
   The KGB chief, Gen. Vladimir Kryuchko, said on Wednesday that
Souther committed suicide.
   Souther defected in 1986 when the FBI began investigating him. At
the time, the Hammond, Ind., native was working as a satellite photo
analyst in the Navy's 2nd Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va.
   Pravda indicated Souther fled his native land ``with pain in his
heart'' only because he feared the FBI investigation.
   ``Of course, not everything Glenn met in the Soviet land was as
he had expected,'' the newspaper said. ``For example, he could never
comprehend that it is possible to drop into a store and be unable to
find some needed item.''
   The article also quoted a letter Souther left to his colleagues
at the KGB, where he was given the rank of major last year.
   ``Justice demands that you hear my last words. I do not regret
our relationship. It was a longstanding one, and helped me grow as a
person. I wish to be buried in the uniform of an officer of the
KGB.''
   The article did not say whether authorities complied with that
request, but Kryuchkov said that Souther was given a military
funeral on Monday and he was buried in the same section of Kuntsevo
Cemetary as Philby.
   Pravda said he took the name Mikhail Orlov after his arrival in
the Soviet Union, choosing the Russian word for ``eagles'' for his
last name because it symbolized freedom and strength.

   Angolan rebels today denied government
claims that they had violated a week-old truce in country's civil
war.
   In a statement released in Lisbon, the guerrillas affirmed their
``total engagement in the process of peace and national
reconciliation.''
   The Angolan government broke off peace negotiations on Friday,
accusing the rebels of violating a June 24 cease-fire by cutting
power lines to Angola's capital, Luanda, and ambushing convoys of
civilian vehicles.
   The guerrillas belong to the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola and have fought to force the government to
share power since shortly after Angola gained independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos signed the cease-fire on June 22 in Gbadolite, Zaire, and
peace talks began on Wednesday in Kinshasa, Zaire.
   The Portuguese state-run RTP network reported Friday that dos
Santos ordered his delegation home and said it would not return
until the rebels explained the alleged cease-fire violations.
   Angola's state news agency ANGOP said Friday that five people
died Thursday when UNITA guerrillas ambushed a convoy transporting
coffee in Cuanza North province.
   The guerrillas' statement said cease-fire instructions may be
taking time to reach all combat units in the field around Angola, a
country twice the size of France.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa on Friday quoted an unidentified
rebel official as saying power lines from the Cambambe dam's
hydroelectric station were downed Thursday when a cow set off a land
mine protecting high-voltage pylons.
   A rebel statement on Friday, meanwhile, rejected government
proposals for special treatment for Savimbi during a national
reconciliation process agreed on at Gbadolite.
   The statement said the government was trying to divide the rebel
movement.
   Savimbi's future was left unclear by the Gbadolite declaration,
which called for reintegration of rebels into Angolan society.
   The rebel leader has agreed to sit out of Angolan politics for
two years before running in free elections against dos Santos'
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola.

   President Najib has agreed to release
an American photographer captured while traveling with Moslem
guerrillas, Palestinian officials said today.
   Najib gave assurances during a meeting Friday with Abu Khalid,
special envoy for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, that Tony O'Brien
would be freed, said the officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``It is not clear if Mr. O'Brien will go through the legal
formalities before he gets the presidential pardon or will be
released after the trial formalities are over,'' said one official.
   ``It is certain that Mr. O'Brien will see his freedom in the
coming weeks, but I am unable to say exactly when,'' he said.
   O'Brien, who did not have a visa to enter Afghanistan, was
arrested by security forces on June 8 at a rebel hideout in Kabul.
He has not been formally charged.
   The 43-year-old native of Santa Fe, N.M., had been covering the
civil war between Najib's Marxist government and the guerrillas. He
was on assignment for Time-Life Inc.
   A government official, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said he could not discuss the prospects for O'Brien's release.
   ``It all depends on the president,'' he said.
   The rebels, backed by the United States and based in neighboring
Pakistan, have been fighting to overthrow the government for 11
years.
   Khalid arrived in Kabul on Thursday to discuss a PLO proposal to
end the war. It calls for an immediate cease-fire and peace talks.
   The guerrillas have refused direct talks with the Soviet-backed
government, insisting that Najib and key members of his government
step down. Najib has said he will not step down unless he has
guarantees his departure would bring peace to Afghanistan.

   Socialist Asae Uemura, a divorced mother of two
trying to beat male incumbents and the party that has ruled Japan
for decades, seems to have everything going for her politically.
   Until recently, a candidate like Ms. Uemura would not have
generated much optimism. But a series of scandals and an unpopular
new tax have played into the hands of opposition office-seekers.
   Public opinion polls paint a dismal picture for the governing
Liberal Democratic Party in an election Sunday for the 128 Tokyo
Municipal Assembly seats.
   With 9 million eligible voters, Tokyo is being watched closely as
an indicator of what could lie ahead for the Liberal Democrats,
Japan's governing party since it was formed in 1954. Nationwide
elections for half the upper house of Parliament are scheduled July
23.
   Only 25 percent of Tokyo voters polled by the Asahi Shimbun
newspaper said they plan to support Liberal Democratic candidates,
down from 34 percent who expressed support before the last such
elections were held in 1985.
   A Kyodo News Service poll released Thursday showed 16 percent
supporting the Socialists, the top national opposition party, while
support for the Liberal Democrats had fallen from 42.4 to only 13.2
percent.
   The increased chances for women may come from voters' anger over
a sex scandal involving Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, who allegedly
has kept several paid mistresses.
   Requests for Uno to give speeches for the party's municipal
candidates have dropped off. At one rally he attended, governing
party supporters scuffled with women carrying placards that said:
``We don't need a prostitution premier.''
   Senior party officials are considering replacing Uno after the
Tokyo polling if the Liberal Democrats lose badly because a loss in
the upper house election then ``will be obvious due to Uno's
womanizing scandal,'' the Mainichi newspaper said.
   ``The Uno Cabinet now seems virtually dead,'' it said in an
editorial.
   Campaigning a few days before the election, Ms. Uemura rode
through the streets of Minato Ward in a van, waving and asking
passers-by for support.
   Like all candidates, Ms. Uemura wore white gloves and a large
carnation in her lapel. She said she spends 12 hours campaigning
each day.
   ``The ant has brought down the elephant,'' Ms. Uemura said,
referring to the upset victory of a female Socialist in a
parliamentary by-election on Sunday in a traditionally conservative
area in northern Japan.
   In the back of the van, two attractive young women _ what
Japanese campaign managers call ``warbler girls'' _ waved and
smiled. One of them, Yukari Hibiya, said she was motivated by the
$177-a-day pay, not strong political convictions.
   ``But I wouldn't have accepted this kind of work from the LDP,
since they're behind the tax,'' she said.
   The Liberal Democrats forced a 3 percent sales tax through
Parliament in December despite an opposition boycott. The sales tax,
part of a controversial tax change, took effect April 1.
   Alarmed by the losses at the polls and reeling from the Recruit
influence-buying scandal that brought down Uno's predecessor, Noboru
Takeshita, the Liberal Democrats has pledged to clean up its image.
   ``As head of the party, I'd like to devote myself entirely to the
party and political reforms,'' Uno said after he became prime
minister June 2.
   Uno was chosen to head the party because he is one of the few
senior Liberal Democrats untainted by Recruit, a publishing
conglomerate accused of doling out millions of dollars in political
donations and underpriced stocks in exchange for favors.
   Among the reforms announced by the Liberal Democrats are
dissolution of party factions, which create power blocs but force
leaders to raise huge sums of money to support their followers'
political activities. Nearly all Liberal Democratic lawmakers belong
to one of six factions.
   Critics say the governing party is not serious about change.
   ``Their plans are full of loopholes,'' said Satsuki Eda, leader
of the Social Democratic Federation, the fifth-largest bloc in
Parliament.
   Eda said self-restraint is needed, not legislation.
   ``They don't need to spend so much money,'' Eda said. ``I don't
spend so much, but I survive elections.''

   A man who watched a co-worker leap out a
sixth-floor window as smoke filled a burning office building said he
almost followed her, but kept his poise and helped four others
escape by ladder.
   Michael Blackman smashed open a window to allow the group to
breathe while they waited for rescue, but one of them panicked and
jumped, and was in critical condition early today. Four other people
were killed.
   ``I wasn't calm. I was scared to death. I think I said, `We're
going to die,''' Blackman said.
   The blaze Friday at the 10-story Peachtree 25th Building also
left more than 20 people hospitalized, including five firefighters.
Officials said rescuers were hampered by panicking office workers.
   ``My understanding is that some firefighters could have saved or
helped more people if they didn't panic. But some people did
panic,'' said Sandra Walker, a spokeswoman for Mayor Andrew Young.
   The woman who jumped from the window, identified as Cassandra
Hayward, 20, broke both legs and an ankle and underwent surgery
Friday night at Piedmont Hospital, a spokesman said.
   Authorities said the fire started about 10:30 a.m. with an
explosion at an electrical panel on the sixth floor of the
dark-tinted glass building, where workers were repairing a fuse.
Authorities said they did not know what caused the explosion and
fire, which later spread two floors below and one above.
   ``It's simple speculation, but it may have been a short,'' said
Acting Fire Chief Tom Perrin.
   The blast killed a maintenance worker who was thrown several
feet, and melted aluminum near the panel, Perrin said.
   Names of the maintenance worker and the other three dead, one of
whom was a woman, were not released by authorities, but the family
of graphics artist Clifton Chandler, 29, confirmed that he was one
of those killed.
   Sgt. Steve Martin of the Fulton County medical examiner's office
said this morning that reports of a fifth death stemmed from an
error in his office. Another, unrelated death occurred about the
time of the fire and for a time was mistakenly included in the fire
toll, he said.
   Blackman, 30, said he heard a series of loud pops from an
electrical panel outside the door of his office suite.
   ``It hit me real quick that we were in real bad trouble,''
Blackman said. ``It went from, `Oh, my God, something really bad has
happened to the guy working on the fuse box,' to `Oh, my God,
something bad is happening to all of us.'
   ``I went running out there. The maintenance guy was out there,
screaming for help,'' Blackman said. ``We couldn't get to him.''
   Blackman and five other workers from the private Bureau of
Wholesale Sales Representatives, including Hayward, fled back into
his office, where smoke began making it difficult to breathe.
Blackman threw a chair through a window, and a few minutes later
Hayward jumped.
   ``She went right by me,'' Blackman said.
   Blackman, who was hospitalized in good condition with smoke
inhalation and cuts, said he led the other workers one by one to the
5-foot-wide window for breaths of air until firefighters could reach
the window with a ladder. Then Blackman helped the others out.
   ``It probably wasn't more than five or 10 minutes. It seemed like
about 30 years,'' Blackman said in a telephone interview from the
hospital.
   Perrin said the fire was severe because the building has no
sprinkler system. It was built in 1962, before sprinklers were
required.
   About 200 people, many of them rescued office workers with
soot-blackened clothing and skin, gathered on the street outside the
building as firefighters battled the blaze. Some sat down, breathing
from oxygen masks.
   Darlene Dunn, 57, said she was one of eight people in a
sixth-floor office when the fire began. She said she acted mainly on
instinct before being rescued by the firefighters' ladder. She used
her chair to break glass.
   ``I busted out a couple of windows so we could breathe fresh
air,'' Ms. Dunn said after being treated for smoke inhalation. ``We
tried to get out of the building but there was no way _ we were
trapped.''
   Harry Komsky, vice president of American Management Co. of Los
Angeles, which manages the building, said the cause of the fire will
be investigated.

<TEXT>
   A communist-led coalition cast its support
today with a conservative party to form an interim government and
end a two-week political standoff.
   The historical alliance between the conservative New Democracy
Party and the Coalition of Left and Progress comes 40 years after
the communists were defeated in a civil war by U.S.-backed
government forces.
   Leftist coalition head Harilaos Florakis emerged from a meeting
today with New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis to announce
he would support an interim government led by New Democracy
parliamentarian Tzanis Tzannetakis.
   Mitsotakis and Florakis conferred with President Christos
Sartzetakis to detail the agreement that allows their coalition to
have a majority in the 300-member parliament and end eight years of
government by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement of Premier Andreas
Papandreou.
   Besieged by a supportive crowd as he left the Presidential
Palace, Mitsotakis said the negotiations had ended positively and
that he had agreed on Tzannetakis as premier designate.
   The president's office announced later that Tzannetakis would be
sworn in on Sunday.
   Tzannetakis, 62, is popular among his colleagues in Parliament
and known for his fervent belief in democratic institutions.
   Papandreou, tainted by financial scandals and a highly publicized
relationship with a woman while he was married, had been asked by
Sartzetakis to remain as caretaker premier until the crisis was
resolved.
   Parliament is scheduled to convene Monday and elect a house
speaker the next day. The new government goes before parliament in
two weeks to seek a vote of confidence.
   Mitsotakis and Florakis agreed that the coalition would have a
three-month life span and that its work would be limited to
restoring democratic institutions and cleaning up Greek politics.
   Florakis said that at the end of the three months, ``We will
re-examine our position and act accordingly.''
   However, one of the two parties could pull out of the coalition
because of wide differences in political ideology. If that happens,
the president would then appoint another caretaker regime consisting
of non-parliamentarians to lead the country to national elections.
   The new coalition accord followed five days of meetings between
leaders of the two groups.
   The conservative-leftist coalition would resolve the political
crisis that followed general elections on June 18.
   New Democracy won 145 seats, six short of a majority. It thus
needed to find a partner if it was to govern.
   The Coalition of the Left and Progress captured 28 seats, while
the larger Panhellenic Socialist Movement took 125 seats.
   Two seats in this month's elections were also won by the small
conservative Democratic Renewal party and an independent.
   Today's agreement came after attempts by leaders of all three
major parties failed to form a coalition government.
   The new parliament is to form a 12-member committee to
investigate allegations that Papandreou and at least 20 other former
ministers from his party and officials were involved in
multimillion-dollar financial scandals. Papandreou has denied any
wrongdoing.
   The conservative-leftist alliance is considered a major blow to
the socialists, who called on the communists to cooperate in a
government of progressive forces. But Florakis turned them down,
saying he would not join forces with a ``scandal-ridden'' group.
   The coalition talks were the first time in the history of Greece,
a nation of 10 million, that the communists had been given the
opportunity to help form a government.

   Sudan's new military leader today said
ending a devastating civil war was his top priority and he promised
to make new offers of peace to the rebels. Twenty-eight army
generals were fired.
   Brig. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir told a meeting of senior
government officials that the peace overtures begun last month by
Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi, whom he toppled on Friday, were
``political machinations and not serious.''
   The 6-year-old war crippled the economy and led to widespead
famine that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.
   The brigadier general, 44, led a military junta of 15 officers in
the bloodless coup, the fourth military upheaval in Sudan's 33 years
of independence.
   Calling itself the command council of the National Salvation
Revolution, the junta immediately assumed dictatorial powers,
including a ban on dissent.
   The National Salvation Revolution council today announced the
firing of 28 army generals, including the commander-in-chief, Gen.
Fat'hi Ahmed Ali, and the chief of staff, Gen. Babu Nimir, a strong
supporter of el-Mahdi.
   The meet was broadcast over official Radio Omdurman.
   Khartoum remained under a nighttime curfew decreed after the
coup, but the city appeared returning to normal today despite tight
security.
   Hundreds of troops were seen on the streets, stopping and
searching cars. Tanks and armored cars were posted at the
presidential palace, army headquarters and bridges spanning the
White Nile and Blue Nile rivers.
   Telex and telephone communications with Khartoum, cut immediately
after the coup, were restored today. Khartoum Airport reopened for
eight hours today for planes carrying Moslem pilgrims to Saudi
Arabia but remained closed to other international traffic.
   El-Bashir criticized el-Mahdi's efforts to negotiate peace with
southern rebels at a meeting of government undersecretaries. But he
made clear that his government is committed to peace.
   ``Our primary goal is peace, and we (the army) are the people
mostly suffering from war,'' he said. ``I will enlist the help of
all experts in the quest for peace.''
   Radio Omdurman frequently interrupted its programming to
broadcast messages of support from military units for el-Bashir.
   The coup leaders on Friday issued decrees that suspended the
constitution and shut down independent newspapers. They banned
political parties, declared a national state of emergency and the
indefinite nighttime curfew.
   El-Bashir named himself prime minister, defense minister and
armed forces commander.
   The fate of el-Mahdi following the coup remained unclear. One
report said he escaped arrest. Another said he was seen being driven
from his home by soldiers.
   In Washington, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler of the U.S. State
Department alluded Friday to reports that a number of Cabinet
minister were arrested.
   ``We regret the military is taking action to overthrow Sudan's
democratically elected government, and we urge an early return to
democracy,'' she said.
   El-Bashir has pledged a non-partisan government and good
relations with all countries. He made no mention of restoring
civilian rule.
   The coup leaders have disavowed any connection with the former
military dictator, President Gaafar Nimeiri, who was ousted by his
top generals in April 1985.
   Nimeiri, in power for 16 years, recently pledged from exile in
Cairo to overthrow el-Mahdi and return to power. A Nimeiri aide
reached by telephone said the former president was in the Egyptian
capital but unavailable for comment.
   El-Bashir is said to be apolitical, although he is a member of
the religious sect that forms the power base of the opposition
Democratic Unionists.
   Another Cairo newspaper, Al-Gomhuriya, described el-Bashir as a
``well-liked, sociable'' officer who studied in the Soviet Union but
is considered anti-communist.
   A former commander of paratroopers fighting in the civil war in
southern Sudan, el-Bashir was the third-ranking officer in the corps
before the coup.
   The war has caused widespread famine and turned many southerners
into refugees.
   Like most ranking Sudanese officers and government officials,
Bashir is a northern Moslem of Arab extraction. The rebels are
Christians and animists of African descent who demand more autonomy
for the south.

   Solidarity-backed lawmakers met today to
decide who to back for president, a powerful new post that Communist
Party leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski says he does not want.
   Solidarity has opposed a candidacy by Jaruzelski, who said on
Friday that he did not want to run because he was too closely linked
to the 1981 martial-law crackdown that crushed the labor union and
forced it underground.
   Jaruzelski recommended Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak for the
office, which is similar to the presidency created in the Soviet
Union for Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said today he believed Czeslaw
Kiszczak had a better chance of winning the post than Jaruzelski.
   The president is to be elected next week by a simple majority of
the National Assembly. Authorities want to have the new president
seated before President Bush's scheduled three-day visit begins July
9.
   ``Whether it's Jaruzelski or Kiszczak is an internal problem of
the government coalition. It seems in this concrete situation that
Gen. Kiszczak has a better chance,'' Walesa told reporters before
the meeting of pro-Solidarity lawmakers.
   ``The general is paying now for everything bad that took place in
Poland. Guilty or not guilty _ let historians think about it _
that's how it is.''
   Kiszczak helped negotiate the historic accord between the
communist-run government and the Solidarity-led opposition that
resulted in the legalization of the trade union, opposition
participation in elections and broad changes in the structure of the
government.
   The 259-member Solidarity delegation in the National Assembly met
behind closed doors. A Solidarity source inside the meeting
lawmakers were discussing the possibility of finding a party or
neutral candidate they could support. The source said the
legislators also debated nominating a Solidarity candidate, an idea
the union so far has opposed.
   At Friday's meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee, officials neither accepted nor rejected
Jaruzelski's proposal that he not run for president.
   But the committee did ask him to reconsider, party spokesman Jan
Bisztyga said. Party representatives to the National Assembly did
the same.
   Outside party headquarters about 500 young anti-Jaruzelski
demonstrators tried to march to the Central Committee meeting, but
riot police blocked them.
   The youths hurled stones, smoke bombs and firebombs at police,
who fired tear gas and bursts from a water cannon in encounters that
lasted for hours. The state news agency PAP said 11 police were hurt
and 14 demonstrators were detained.
   Jaruzelski, 65, said he chose not to run because he was too
closely associated with the crackdown on Solidarity.
   ``The key matter for Poland now ... is national agreement ...
When there is an obstacle to reconciliation and to the uniting of
social forces, there is only one possible solution _ even if that
obstacle is Wojciech Jaruzelski,'' he said in his statement, later
carried by state media.
   Endorsing Kiszczak, sitting a few seats away, Jaruzelski called
him ``a soldier, a politician, a patriot and a man who has been
close to me for many years ... In the eyes of society, including
opposition circles, he is rightly considered a leading
representative of the line of reconciliation.''
   Jaruzelski said nothing about leaving his powerful post as party
chief.
   Also Friday, the government announced a one-month wage-and-price
freeze, halting major price increases until after the new parliament
and government are seated.
   Bisztyga indicated that some legislators in the communist-led
coalition fear that Jaruzelski lacks enough votes in the National
Assembly for a safe election. The coalition nominally has a 300-259
majority over Solidarity-backed legislators, but its internal
discipline is wobbly.
   Bisztyga said a final decision on a nominee will be made at a
later party meeting after consultations with the two junior partners
in the coalition _ the Peasant and Democratic parties.
   ``If decisions of those groups show a safe election calculation,
then there is a possibility'' Jaruzelski would be the nominee after
all, Bisztyga said. Otherwise, Kiszczak would be considered.
   A Jaruzelski loyalist, Kiszczak, 63, is an army general who heads
Poland's extensive police apparatus and helped wage the government's
war against Solidarity for most of the 1980's.
   But he won the confidence of Solidarity's leaders during
negotiations that began last Aug. 31 during a national wave of
strikes.
   In parliamentary elections June 4 and June 18, Solidarity got 99
of its candidates elected to the 100-member Senate, and it won all
the 161 seats available to the opposition in the 460-member Sejm.

   Syrian and Lebanese Christian gunners
today battled with howitzers and rocket launchers, ignoring Arab
calls to halt 15 weeks of violence. Police said three people were
killed and 16 wounded.
   The latest casualties increased the toll to 385 people killed and
1,515 wounded since the latest round in the 14-year-old civil war
broke out March 8, pitting Christian army commander Gen. Michel
Aoun's units against Syrian and Druse forces.
   In Baghdad, Iraq today declared it is ready to cut off arms
shipments to Lebanon's Christians if other countries stop providing
weapons to Lebanon's Moslems. ``Other countries'' was a reference to
Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Moslem-held territory under a 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   The Syrians have refused repeated calls by the Arab League to
lift the siege of the Christian enclave, saying they wanted
guarantees that Aoun will not be able to receive war material from
Iraq, their main Arab foe.
   Syrian gunners, deployed in Moslem west Beirut and the
surrounding mountains, pounded the 310-square-mile Christian-held
region northeast of the capital with 130mm howitzers and 107mm
multibarrelled rocket launchers.
   Aoun's gunners responded with 155mm howitzers.
   The spokesman said the Syrian barrage targeted two east Beirut
Christian districts, the coastline north of the capital and the
wooded valleys east of the waterfront, where Aoun's artillery
batteries are deployed.
   He said Aoun's gunners responded against the Syrian artillery
batteries along west Beirut's seaside boulevard.
   A spokesman for Aoun's command, who refused to be further
identified, said his gunners ``scored several direct hits on the
Syrian artillery emplacements in west Beirut.''
   The command of a Syrian army contingent in Beirut refused comment
on losses.
   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported seeing a
Syrian army ambulance rushing to a seaside Syrian howitzer
emplacement in west Beirut shortly before dawn.
   ``Seconds later, the ambulance sped out of the emplacement, which
is hidden behind sand ramparts. I don't know what happened there,''
one witness said.
   The thud of exploding shells and the whistling of rockets echoed
across Beirut and its surroundings.
   The intensity of the barrage sharply decreased around 8 a.m.,
allowing people to leave underground shelters.
   No explanation was given for the escalation in the confrontation,
which came a few hours before a scheduled meeting in the Saudi town
of Jeddah by three Arab foreign ministers to consider a mechanism
for stabilizing Lebanon.
   A full-fledged Arab summit in May urged a settlement to Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war by November.
   The confrontation broke out two days after Aoun blockaded illegal
ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of beirut to salvage about
$100 million in lost customs dues annually.
   The Syrians and their allies retaliated by besieging the
Christian enclave, home for 1 million people.
   Aoun escalated the confrontation by declaring a ``war of
liberation'' on the Syrian force deployed in Lebanon.

   If you fancy a grinning Richard Nixon clown
doll or a bas-relief of the Last Supper in bilious brown plastic,
the Library of Congress is the place for you.
   Famous for its priceless collection of books and manuscripts, the
Library of Congress also is the secret repository for perhaps the
world's biggest collection of the ephemera of American pop culture.
   From birdbaths to Barbie dolls, the Library of Congress has it
all.
   ``We don't critique it, we just collect it,'' says Frank J. Evina
of the library's U.S. Copyright Office, the government's keeper of
kitsch.
   Here in this Washington suburb, miles from the library's hushed,
oak-paneled main reading room on Capitol Hill, the Copyright Office
has schlepped enough schlock over the years to fill a cavernous
warehouse nearly the size of a domed football stadium.
   Stuffed in cardboard boxes and stacked high on metal shelves are
millions of wall plaques, plaster busts, T-shirts, games, puzzles,
dolls, gaudy fabrics, cereal boxes, posters, lamps, garden
fountains, door knockers, wall thermometers, whiskey decanters and
other memorabilia of America's throwaway society.
   ``This is the creative genius of America,'' said Evina with a
wave of his arm. ``Isn't it wonderful?''
   Until the copyright law was changed in 1978, applicants for
copyright protection for their music, writings or artistic designs
were required to submit two samples of their work to the Copyright
Office.
   That created a worsening headache for copyright officials, who
had to store all that stuff somewhere, until Congress decided that
photographs or written descriptions would suffice.
   Although the Copyright Office has copyrighted more than 45
million items since the late 19th century, the bulk of the objects
kept at the Landover warehouse cover pop culture of the late 1950s
through the 1970s.
   For Watergate wallowers, there is the Watergate chess set. Pieces
sculpted in white represent the good guys, Sam Ervin and his Senate
investigators. Opposing pieces cast in a dark hues include President
Nixon in a defiant pose, flanked by his gang of Haldeman,
Ehrlichman, Mitchell and Dean.
   Music lovers can sample more than 2 million audio tape cassettes
of forgettable songs that were copyrighted _ but never published _
by neighborhood garage rock bands. Sample titles: ``Punch a Wall,''
``Where Does All This Love Come From?'' and ``Take Me Back to
Adolescence.''
   Among the plaster likenesses of Buddha, Harpo Marx, John F.
Kennedy, Don Quixote, Albert Schweitzer, Laurel and Hardy and a
snarling German shepherd was a stack of X-rated videos, including
``Hot Nights at the Blue Note Cafe,'' and a box of pornographic
paperback novels with titles like ``Naughty, Naughty Wife.''
   Flower pots came in the shape of hippos, lions, snails, turtles
and frogs. There was a fire hydrant ice bucket in bright red, a fake
gold Miss America trophy from 1955 and a plastic wall thermometer
decorated with a woodpecker and a button that's supposed to turn
blue for fair weather and pink for rain.
   Whiskey decanters portrayed Democratic donkeys and Republican
elephants, a Hawaiian warrior, a crank-operated telephone, a pair of
combat boots and helmet, antique cars and a pyramid representing the
El Kahir Shrine Temple in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
   The collection is closed to the public, but Evina says the
Library of Congress probably ought to mount an exhibition of this
lowlife Americana some day.
   A few mementos from yesteryear, such as once-familiar cereal
boxes and toothpaste tubes no longer seen on store shelves, may
exist only in the Copyright Office's collection and would be
irreplaceable, he said.
   ``Someday someone will thank us for keeping all these things,''
said the government's guru of gewgaws.

<HEAD>Industry Says EPA May Tamper With Bush's Clean Air Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industries with the highest stakes in clean air
legislation are lobbying to make sure stringent enforcement
provisions aren't slipped into the formal bill submitted to Congress
by the Bush administration.
   Industry lobbyists say they believe some Environmental Protection
Agency officials want to be tougher on industry than does President
Bush, who unveiled his clean air plan June 12.
   Lobbyists for the auto, electric utility and petroleum industries
say they are particularly concerned about tougher standards on acid
rain, additional curbs on motor vehicle pollution, and the amount of
flexibility that industry will be given to reduce pollutants.
   The bill promises to be at the center of a major congressional
struggle for at least the next six months.
   ``We're emphasizing the importance of sticking with the
president's program,'' said Dale Brooks, a Chevron lobbyist who has
participated in petroleum industry meetings with administration
officials since Bush outlined his plan.
   ``If they start dragging in cats and dogs ... it will slow down
the process considerably,'' he said.
   EPA spokesman David Cohen responded: ``If the rumor is we're
going off in directions rejected by the (administration's) Domestic
Policy Council, that's absolutely false. We're taking a very
conservative approach to making the president's idea work.''
   The industry lobbyists said their concern was inspired in part by
an early EPA draft of the legislation, which contained measures
industry didn't like, but which preceded Bush's announcement and is
now _ everyone agrees _ outdated. They added that administration
officials listened, but made no specific commitments on legislative
language.
   The industry executives pointed out that Bush only revealed the
broad outlines and goals of his plan, while leaving the legislative
drafting _ where a word or numerical change can make an enormous
difference _ to technical and policy experts.
   ``Our concern is the EPA will try to make the bill more stringent
than Bush indicated,'' said one lobbyist for a large utility who
participated in one meeting and was familiar with several others.
``I would say the effort is low-key, fairly targeted and fairly
discreet.''
   The lobbyist, who spoke only on condition his name not be used,
said utilities are concerned with the acid rain reduction plan
because Bush did not use precise language on the amount of sulfur
dioxide emissions to be permitted by coal-fired power plants.
   Bush said his proposal ``envisions'' an emission standard of 2.5
pounds per million BTUs through 1995. That would be tightened to
``approximately'' 1.2 pounds per million BTUs through the year 2000.
   ``Those words give EPA room to wiggle around'' in achieving the
sought-after 10 million-ton sulfur dioxide reduction, the lobbyist
said, noting that EPA has in the past discussed an even tougher
standard for the 1995-2000 phase.
   The industry official added that at a meeting with EPA officials,
``We didn't accuse them of subverting what the president said, but
EPA knew why were were inquiring about some of these things.''
   The auto industry, which says the replacement of old cars with
new ones will lower motor vehicle emissions, is wary of new tailpipe
standards. The petroleum industry is concerned about how far Bush's
plan for alternative motor vehicle fuels will go.
   Other industry concerns are that EPA might try to impose strong
permit requirements that would be a ``bureaucratic nightmare,''
insert strong federal authority over state and local governments and
give the EPA administrator wider powers.
   There has been no comparable lobbying effort by environmental
organizations, said Casey Padgett, director of Environmental Action.
   ``Trying to lobby EPA would be trying to lobby our friends,''
Padgett said. ``And we don't have the access to OMB (Office of
Management and Budget) that industry does.''
   Richard Ayres, head of the Clean Air Coalition composed of major
environmental groups, said he's willing to wait for the ``fine
print'' before launching any lobbying campaign.
   One oil industry lobbyist said, however, he thinks Bush will keep
his proposal free from tampering.
   ``This president is hands-on'' and ``he's going to want to see it
and understand it,'' said Marc Himmelstein of the American Petroleum
Institute.

<HEAD>United States Scorns Some Dictators, Not Mobutu</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some heavy-handed Third World leaders are
scorned by the United States for human rights abuses. Then there's
Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko, who turned up here last week and
received a red carpet welcome.
   For the past generation, Mobutu has been a source of both pride
and anguish to Washington. It is hard to find a leader anywhere more
willing to support Washington's policies than Mobutu, but he is a
leader who tolerates virtually no dissent while presiding over what
is widely regarded as one of Africa's most corrupt societies.
   Mobutu himself has accumulated vast personal wealth, taking the
form of a number of castles and palaces in Europe and elsewhere and
huge foreign bank accounts. Some estimates of these accounts run
into the billions but Mobutu has put the figure at ``less than $50
million.''
   Randall Robinson, an Africa expert and liberal critic of Mobutu,
derides Zaire as a ``kleptocracy.''
   Successive administrations in Washington dating back to Mobutu's
rise to power in 1965 have been willing to overlook Mobutu's
perceived shortcomings and focus instead on his unswerving
willingness to support U.S. strategic objectives.
   At a time when so many Third World countries, regardless of
political system, have shied away from supporting Washington's
foreign policy agenda, Mobutu is an exception.
   He has allowed the U.S. military use of Zairean territory to
resupply anti-communist guerrillas in Angola. He played a major role
in bringing about a cease-fire in Angola's civil war on June 22, a
goal that had eluded the efforts of others for 14 years.
   He has been an outspoken opponent of Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi. His representatives have lobbied hard against anti-American
resolutions in the Organization of African Unity and other Third
World groups.
   A month ago, he helped the Bush administration fend off a bid by
the Palestine Liberation Organization to join the World Health
Organization. When the United States decided to boycott the 1980
Olympics in Moscow, Mobutu ordered Zaire's athletes to stay home as
well.
   But then there is Mobutu's authoritarian side, which was
described recently by Freedom House, a New York-based group which
attempts to promote democracy throughout the world.
   In Zaire, the report said, ``presidential elections are farces.
Private newspaper ownership remains only in name. Broadcasting is
government owned and directed. Censorship and self-censorship are
pervasive. There is no right of assembly, and union organization is
controlled. Government has been arbitrary and capricious. The
judiciary is not independent; prisoners of conscience are numerous,
and execution and torture common.''
   In terms of human freedom, the report ranked Zaire at about the
same level as Vietnam which, like Zaire, is a one-party state.
Corruption in Zaire, the study said, is ``pervasive.'' Many of the
same criticisms are contained in the annual State Department human
rights report.
   None of the supposed drawbacks appears to have had much impact on
U.S. aid programs in Zaire. Hundreds of millions of U.S. aid dollars
have been earmarked for Zaire under Mobutu's rule. The aid levels
recently have been averaging a shade under $50 million, making Zaire
one of the largest aid recipients in Africa.
   When President Bush received Mobutu on Thursday, he skirted the
human rights issue, concentrating instead in his public remarks on
the Zairean's diplomatic achievements and his staunch backing for
American policies.
   During his visit, Mobutu dismissed questions about human rights
abuses, contending that he has the support of ``100 percent'' of
Zaire's 34 million people. And for all the sympathy he has received
from Washington over the years, Mobutu indicated in an appearance
Friday that his friendship has not always been reciprocated.
   Seemingly more in sorrow than in anger, Mobutu said the Sudan
received eight times more U.S. aid than Zaire several years ago
despite staking out anti-U.S. positions.
   ``We have been a steadfast friend,'' he said. ``I find this a bit
confusing.''

<HEAD>Mistrial Declared After Puzzled Juror Brings Dictionary To Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge declared a mistrial in a murder
case after learning that the jury foreman had brought a dictionary
into the deliberations so jurors could look up words the judge used
in his instructions.
   ``It was highly improper,'' David N. Cooper, attorney for
defendant Moses Davison, said Friday. ``They were sitting in the
jury room using a dictionary to determine the guilt or innocence of
my client.''
   Under questioning by Superior Court Judge Dominic Cresto, Robert
Forest, a Pawtucket teacher who was the jury foreman, admitted he
brought a dictionary with him Thursday.
   One of the words he said jurors looked up was ``malice,'' defined
by the Random House Dictionary of the English Language as a ``desire
to inflict injury or suffering on another, especially when based on
deep-seated meanness.''
   The law, however, defines malice differently. Black's Law
Dictionary says malice is ``not necessarily personal hate or ill
will, but it is that state of mind which is reckless of the law and
of the legal rights of the citizen.''
   Cooper said that if the jurors wanted the judge to repeat the
legal definition of malice, all they had to do was ask.
   The mistrial Friday allows the prosecution to bring Davison, 39,
a construction worker from Houston, to trial again in the slaying of
Carl Williams, also a construction worker from Texas.

<TEXT>
   For Burmese students who saw their own
dreams of democracy crushed last year, the suppression of
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing conjures up bitter memories.
   Several thousand protesters were killed in Burma when the
military put down a nationwide uprising demanding political reform
and an end to a quarter century of economic mismanagement and
authoritarian, one-party rule.
   ``We feel for the Chinese students because the same things have
happened to us,'' said Aung Myint, who was a university student
during the Burma uprising. ``It seems that there isn't much
difference between the military in China and the military in Burma.''
   Unlike ``people power'' struggles in the Philippines and
elsewhere in Asia, force has largely succeeded, at least for the
time being, in stifling popular cries for democracy in Burma and
China.
   But nine months after Burma put down its uprising, the political
climate remains uncertain. Elections have been promised in the
spring of 1990 and oppostion parties have been permitted.
   But the opposition groups complain of harrassment and continuing
arrests, and many doubt the military will be willing to transfer
power in the future.
   ``What we saw in both countries was a challenge to established
authority in a form that they were not willing to countenance,''
said Michael Leifer a Southeast Asia expert in London.
   He said a common factor in both countries, which seemed to lead
to the bloody climaxes, was an older generation of leaders
controlling the events.
   Burma expert Joseph Silverstein notes differences between the top
leaders of the two countries. ``Deng Xiaoping was a whole lot
smarter and (Burma's) Ne Win a whole lot crueler,'' the American
academic said in an interview, noting China's economic progress and
Burma's stagnation.
   Although Brig. Gen. Saw Maung is nominally Burma's head of state,
Western diplomats say 78-year-old strongman Ne Win retains power,
despite his official retirement last July.
   In China, no promise of political change has been indicated. But
both countries have pledged to pursue domestic economic reforms and
open doors to foreign economic influence, which in Burma's case had
been closed since the early 1960s.
   The international community was outraged by both crackdowns and
announced economic sanctions. But within a few months the boycott of
Burma began to erode. Critics say the revival of trade ties, mostly
by Asian countries, has boosted the military government and works
against the democratic movement.
   If maintained, international economic sanctions were likely to be
more damaging to China's more sophisticated economy, Leifer said.
   Years of socialist mismanagement took Burma, once one of
Southeast Asia's richest countries, to the brink of economic
collapse.
   Silverstein believes it was because of this that Burma's uprising
attracted great popular support.
   He believes the Burma ``revolution'' was on the verge of success
until the military became worried about splits within its ranks.
Only then did it move decisively to crush the demonstrators. Some
differences were also reported within the Chinese military, but if
they existed they were finally overridden.
   In Burma, students like Aung Myint are last year's heroes. While
Chinese dissidents are feted in the West and allowed generous visa
extensions, Burmese students complain they are largely ignored.
   Aung Myint was among the estimated 7,500 students who fled the
repression. He said he decided to go after witnessing the killing of
five close friends and many others at the gates of Mandalay
Univerity.
   He now lives at Manerplaw, the jungle headquarters of the Karen
National Union, an ethnic rebel group fighting for greater autonomy.
Several hundred Burmese students are fighting alongside the rebels.
   U.S. congressmen last week voted $2 million in humanitarian aid
to the exiled Burmese, many of whom suffer harsh jungle conditions
and have contracted malaria. The students say more could be done for
them and against the Rangoon government by the international
community.
   Silverstein said the political climate in Burma is more volatile
than in China, ``I don't think for a moment there has been any
settling down, the heavy hand of the military has squashed but not
eliminated,'' he said.
   ``I think ... that while Deng has found his man and the system
will go forward. Ne Win has still to find his man and his system.''

   Three Kurdish guerillas were killed
Saturday in a clash with security forces, the semi-official Anatolia
news agency reported.
   The agency said the security forces were conducting a search in a
mountainous area near the Syrian border when they encountered the
guerrillas and ordered them to surrender. The rebels opened fire,
the agency said.
   Security forces have launched a massive operation in the
mountains of southeastern Turkey as a result of the increase of
Kurdish attacks over the past two months.
   Kurdish rebels are fighting for an independent Marxist state in
parts of eastern and southeastern Turkey. More than 900 security
personnel and civilians and an equal number of insurgents have been
killed since the Kurds started hit-and-run attacks in 1984, official
reports say.
   Ethnic Kurds make up about one-fifth of Turkey's population of 55
million.

   Buzz Aldrin laments that ``the
promise of Apollo was never fulfilled,'' that the American space
program languished after he and Neil Armstrong left the first human
footprints on the moon two decades ago.
   He says he hopes the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11 will ``become
a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human
expansion outward.''
   But given today's political and tight budgetary climate, Aldrin
is not too hopeful.
   President Bush is expected to voice continuing support for a
permanent manned space station and say other nice things about
NASA's program when he meets with Aldrin, Armstrong and their
command module pilot, Michael Collins, on July 20, the anniversary
of the moon landing.
   But no matter how many nice things the president says about
space, the political truth is that Congress must approve the money.
And with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut,
Congress is not expected to give much support to new projects.
   So the National Aeronautics and Space Administration once again
is at a crossroads, as it was when the glory days of Apollo ended.
   President John F. Kennedy had committed this nation to landing a
man on the moon in the 1960s. The goal was to gain space superiority
over the Soviet Union, whose early feats had earned the Russians
worldwide respect and shocked Americans.
   When the United States won the race to the moon, NASA laid out
bold plans for the future.
   To a presidential panel, agency head Thomas Paine in 1969
proposed a 12-man space station and a reusable space shuttle in
operation as early as 1976, followed by a station in moon orbit, a
base on the moon, a 50-man space station in Earth orbit and a manned
mission to Mars in the 1980s.
   But in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and
involvement in Vietnam, costly plans to explore space were given low
priority.
   Only the reuseable space shuttle survived, and its proposed
funding was cut deeply.
   ``Those were tough times,'' said Paine, who resigned in
frustration a year after Apollo 11.
   The Ford and Carter administrations were lukewarm toward the
space program, but the shuttle was built. It performed capably as a
space truck for 24 missions until Jan. 28, 1986, when the Challenger
exploded, killing its seven crew members and grounding the program
for 32 months.
   NASA had gained some hope from President Reagan's endorsement of
a strong space program and from his 1984 State of the Union message,
in which he backed building the space station Freedom.
   In 1985, Congress created a commission to define long-term space
goals. Its chief was Thomas Paine, the former NASA administrator.
   Six months after Challenger, Paine stood in the Oval Office and
gave Reagan a slick leather-bound volume that recommended the space
station, a lunar base and manned trips to Mars _ essentially an
update of Paine's 1969 plan.
   Reagan two years later signed a Presidential Directive on
National Space Policy that stated space leadership was a fundamental
objective. It endorsed the space station and, without being
specific, set a long-range goal ``to expand human presence and
activity beyond Earth orbit into the solar system.''
   Reagan's policy set in motion a NASA program named Pathfinder
whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic
exploration of the moon and planets, advanced missions in orbit and
on planetary surfaces, extended human presence in space, and space
transportation to the moon and planets.
   Bush has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a
space station. He established the National Space Council, headed by
Vice President Dan Quayle, to recommend a comprehensive space policy.
   Quayle is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for Bush's
anniversary meeting with the Apollo 11 astronauts.
   NASA needs a decision from Congress soon on how much money it can
spend next year on space station Freedom. A permanent orbiting space
station is essential to those ambitious Pathfinder dreams and would
serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into
space.
   Bush has requested $2.05 billion in the budget for fiscal 1990 to
continue work on the station. Predictions are that Congress will
trim that by $400 million to $700 million, amounts that space
officials say could further delay or even kill the project.
   The space station project has gone through five tumultuous years.
Reagan wanted it built in cooperation with America's major allies,
but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10
European nations, Japan and Canada agreed to invest nearly $8
billion to build sections of it.
   NASA said in 1984 it could begin launching segments of the
orbiting laboratory in 1992 and estimated the U.S. cost at $8
billion. In 1987, agency officials revised the pricetag to $14.6
billion. The new figure covered a suddenly scaled-down Phase One,
which left off two of the external struts to which experiment
modules would be attached. The struts would be added in orbit under
Phase Two.
   Shortly after that, a National Research Council panel reviewing
station costs and technical issues for the White House said the
total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be $25.02
billion, with Phase Two raising the cost to $32.8 billion.
   The schedule began slipping. And NASA now says if it receives the
proper funding, it could begin assembling the station in 1995.
   Some in Congress believe NASA should alter its plans and build a
less complex station and, instead of relying totally on the space
shuttle, develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting
job.
   Orbiting at 250 miles, Freedom would be home to a crew of eight,
with astronauts rotating back to Earth after four to six months.
   The station would allow humans to study the stars and planets
from the pollution-free environment of space. The weightless
interior would permit manufacture of new, contamination-free
medicines and other products impossible to create on Earth.
Astronauts would assemble, service and repair satellites and send
them out into space. And the station could eventually be the staging
point for man's return to the moon or a journey to Mars.
   No one can predict whether these grand plans will come about, but
the three astronauts who made that extraordinary Apollo 11 flight to
the moon 20 years ago think they should.
   ``A permanent presence in space is a worthy objective, and I hope
that space station Freedom becomes a reality,'' Neil Armstrong said
recently.
   ``I strongly endorse the station, a scientific base on the moon
and eventually manned flights to Mars,'' said Buzz Aldrin.
   Michael Collins, who orbited the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin
walked its surface, envisioned setting up a colony on Mars.
   ``We're a nation of explorers,'' he said. ``We started on the
East Coast, we went to the West Coast, and then vertically. Starting
with the Wright brothers, Chuck Yeager through the sound barrier,
Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon.
   ``It's in our tradition, it's in our culture.''

   An Iran-bound ship believed to
be carrying a chemical used to make deadly mustard gas docked here
today, sources said. West German television said it would be stopped
before reaching Iran.
   Iran's Tehran radio today denied that the shipment, which is at
the center of a chemical weapons scandal in West Germany, was bound
for Iran.
   The West German-flagged Seacrest Pioneer docked in Dubai today
from Bombay, India, Dubai-based shipping sources said on condition
of anonymity. The sources said the ship was due to leave later today
to return to Bombay, but they had no word on the ship's cargo or
whether any part of it was unloaded.
   The ZDF network in West Germany on Friday identified the ship as
the Seacrest Pioneer and said it was carrying thionyl chloride, a
compound used to make mustard gas. The report quoted unidentified
government sources in Bonn.
   West German prosecutors said Thursday they had opened a criminal
investigation of Rheineisen Chemical Products of Duesseldorf, which
contracted to deliver to Iran more than 250 tons of thionyl chloride.
   Government officials said Friday they had information that the
shipment had left Bombay but gave no further details. Officials of
the company, run by an Iranian family, earlier had claimed they had
halted the shipment on Wednesday in Bombay.
   Rheineisen officials deny any wrongdoing and say they had
government approval for the 257-ton shipment. The company has said
it would cooperate in stopping the shipment.
   The New York Times today quoted an Indian official as saying the
Indian government's State Trading Corp. sold Iran 60 tons of thionyl
chloride in March. The official was quoted as saying the chemical
was shipped from Bombay and the sale did not represent a breach of
local laws because the chemical is a freely traded commodity often
used in pesticides.
   The Iranian Foreign Ministry said Friday it never planned to
purchase chemicals from a West German company to produce poison gas.
   Tehran radio, in a commentary today, denied allegations that a
shipment of chemicals to manufacture chemical weapons was bound for
Iran. It said the reports were perpetrated by the United States and
showed renewed American hostility toward Iran.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia,
quoted an unidentified ministry spokesman as saying the allegations
were ``false, biased and followed particular political propaganda
goals.''
   The spokesman ``categorically denied reports on Iran's intention
to purchase chemical materials for manufacture of chemical weapons''
and accused U.S. and European media of making up the story.
   The news agency also quoted the spokesman as denying the Iranians
had summoned home a diplomat in the case.
   The West German Foreign Ministry said it had asked Iran to recall
the diplomat after receiving information from Washington that he
allegedly was involved in the deal. But the diplomat left before a
formal request was made.
   The Iranian spokesman said the diplomat's tour of duty had ended
more than a month ago and that he had returned to Tehran, according
to the Iranian news agency.
   Sources in Bonn identified the man as Seyed Karim Ali Sobhani and
said he had worked for the Iranian Embassy here since September 1987.
   The Rheineisen disclosures follow an international uproar six
months ago over the involvement of West German companies in building
a factory outside Tripoli, Libya, that Washington said would be used
to make poison gas. Libya said the plant would produce
pharmaceuticals.

<HEAD>Students Clash with Police; President Orders Crackdown on Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students protesting a
government ban on travel to North Korea clashed violently with
police Saturday, and President Roh Tae-woo ordered a crackdown on
student leaders.
   At Seoul's Hanyang University, the 24-hour siege of a classroom
building ended after hundreds of students wielding metal pipes and
clubs fled down a hillside through a police blockade. Some were
arrested and others surrendered.
   More than 1,000 students barricaded themselves in the building
Friday after riot police stormed the campus to break up a rally of
thousands of students planning to march to North Korea.
   The students wanted to attend this week's World Youth Festival in
the North Korean capital of Pyongyang.
   Police arrested about 650 students Friday and 100 Saturday in the
biggest single raid inside a college campus since Roh came to power
in February 1988. About 2,000 riot police stayed inside the campus
overnight.
   The Seoul government banned participation in the youth festival
and said anyone going would be charged with violations of national
security. Prosecutors said Im Suk-yong, a 20-year-old Seoul student
who traveled to North Korea through third countries, would be
arrested when she returned.
   Roh issued a statement Saturday saying authorities would punish
anyone who had unauthorized contacts with communist North Korea.
   The North has ``instigated students and other figures to secretly
visit Pyongyang ... showing that the North is still harboring an
intent to communize the South,'' he said.
   Police arrested 100 students Saturday before the building siege
ended. Many were caught after several hundred students wielding
pipes and firebombs slid down a steep hill behind the building and
raced from campus with police in pursuit.
   Witnesses said about 20 police and students were injured in
fighting before the students fled.
   Twenty-two student leaders later surrendered to police peacefully
after a college official was allowed to talk to the students.
   Students at four other Seoul campuses demonstrated against the
police occupation of Hanyang.
   About 500 students took over a major intersection Saturday near
downtown Seoul shouting ``Down with police violence!'' and
``Participation in Pyongyong festival!'' newspapers reported.
   Reports said they hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police.
There were no injuries.
   The Korean peninsula was split into the communist North and
capitalist South after World War II. The two countries fought a war
from 1950-53 and remain bitter enemies.

<HEAD>Pope to Send Envoy to Poland; Full Diplomatic Ties Imminent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has decided to send a
diplomatic envoy to Warsaw, clearing the way for full relations
between the Vatican and the pope's native Poland, according to a
papal letter released Saturday.
   Poland would be the first Warsaw Pact country to have full
diplomatic ties with the Holy See. Relations were cut by the
communists, who took power in Poland in 1945.
   In a letter to Cardinal Josef Glemp, the nation's Roman Catholic
leader, the pope said he was ready to send a representative to
Warsaw.
   ``The Apostolic See wishes that the decision that it now takes
can constitute the full continuation of diplomatic relations with
Poland,'' the pope wrote.
   A senior church official in Rome, speaking on condition of
anomymity, said the pope's decision ``means that full diplomatic
relations are imminent, and it's not going to be a matter of
months.''
   The pope's letter was dated April 11. The church official said
the Vatican chose to release it now so as not to link the diplomatic
issue with the expected selection of a Polish president later this
week.
   John Paul said the Polish government has been seeking
normalization of relations with the Vatican through the exchange of
envoys, and that Poland's bishops approved of the idea.
   ``At the current state of affairs, it seems possible, and even
opportune, that the Holy See send to Warsaw a representative with
appropriate characteristics,'' the letter said.
   The letter did not say who the Vatican envoy would be or what
diplomatic title he would hold.
   The pope said the envoy's presence in Warsaw was also important
because Polish churchmen, Vatican representatives and government
officials have been preparing a Vatican-state accord, known as a
Convention, that has been considered a condition for establishment
of diplomatic ties.
   ``In this phase of preparations, the Holy See would be ready to
send its representative to Poland even before the signing of the
Convention,'' the letter said. ``This is so the full-time
representative of the Holy See in Poland can participate in the
final elaboration of the text of the Convention, which is an
important document of international scope.''
   The pope said the Vatican now has diplomatic relations with 117
countries.
   The communist-led government of Poland, an overwhelmingly
Catholic nation, has been eager to establish full relations with the
Vatican to boost its standing. In May, the Polish Parliament enacted
three bills establishing the legal status of the church.
   The church has played an influential role in Poland. Following
the martial law crackdown in 1981, the church provided moral support
to the banned opposition movement. Church officials were also
instrumental in helping set up the talks that led to the
legalization of Solidarity and to Poland's freest elections since
World War II.

   Two flight attendants were injured during a severe
thunderstorm after an American Airlines jetliner was denied
permission by Cuban air traffic controllers to change course,
officials said.
   State Department spokesman Adam Shub said officials were
considering filing a formal protest with the Cuban government. He
said the incident Thursday night involving Flight 1089 from Miami to
Kingston, Jamaica, apparently stemmed from Cuba's recently announced
warning that it would shoot down unauthorized aircraft as part of
its anti-drug push.
   ``We have urged the Cuban government to exercise restraint in
implementing its announced policy of shooting down unauthorized
aircraft that do not land for inspection,'' Shub said. ``While we
welcome the increased efforts to interdict narcotics trafficking,
the loss of innocent life must be avoided.''
   About 9:30 p.m. Thursday, the pilot radioed Havana air traffic
controllers, asking if the plane could steer away from the sudden
storm in a 17-mile-wide air corridor used by foreign carriers flying
over Cuba, officials said.
   ``He asked if he could deviate to the left or right,'' American
spokesman Jim Brown said. ``They refused to let him do it.''
   No permission came, and ``as a result, they had to ride it on
through. They couldn't have made a U-turn within the air corridor,''
Brown said.
   The 180 passengers were told to buckle their seat belts. The
seven flight attendants were tossed by the storm and a lightning
strike as they tried to put away food trays and other loose items,
officials said.
   American is considering rerouting its Caribbean and Latin
American flights around Cuba, Brown said.
   Ken Van Auken, area manager for Miami's air route traffic control
center, said there normally is good cooperation between U.S. and
Cuban air traffic controllers.
   American spokesman John Raymond said one of the injured flight
attendants was treated at a Kingston hospital, but he had no
details. The other injured flight attendant didn't require
treatment, he said.

   Owners of 20 new homes have been given one
month to dig up their lawns, planted in violation of drought
restrictions.
   ``What are people supposed to do, tell their kids to run out and
play in the mud?'' developer Mike Rupprecht, one of the people who
planted grass, complained Friday. ``The drought is over. Everbody
knows that.''
   Not true, says the East Bay Municipal Utility District. Despite
spring downpours, reservoirs are still well below normal in the San
Ramon Valley.
   Officials of the two-county utility district mailed notices to
owners of 20 new homes ordering removal of grass. Like everyone who
applied for a permit after May 10, 1988, to hook up to the
district's water system, they were required to agree not to plant a
lawn, water conservation manager Dick Bennett said.
   ``We get about 4,000 new customers a year. Just 20 didn't go
along. We have to be fair to everyone,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Small Planes Left With No Place To Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Owners of small aircraft and several members of
Congress are trying to get the government to reconsider a new rule
that leaves thousands of planes with no place to land near the
nation's biggest cities.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said the order requiring
altitude signalling devices on all planes flying within 30 miles of
the most congested airports ``should significantly reduce the danger
of midair collisions.'' The FAA rule took effect Saturday.
   But pilots and small plane owners say it will clutter air traffic
control screens, effectively bar 40,000 planes from 1,200 airports
near big cities, and do nothing to enhance safety.
   Under the rule, only planes carrying Mode C transponders can fly
within 30 miles of the nation's 27 most congested airports. Mode C
sends a signal telling air traffic controllers where the plane is
and at what altitude.
   The transponders have always been required for planes that use
major airports, but they have not previously been required for
low-altitude flights past the airports or for access to smaller
general aviation airports that fall within the 30-mile ``veils.''
   Patricia Weil, spokeswoman for the 290,000-member Aircraft Owners
and Pilots Association, said the order will effectively put
off-limits to non-Mode C planes all the airports in the Los Angeles
basin, scores of public and private airports and helipads around
Washington, D.C., and hundreds of airports near other cities that
serve vital business and medical air traffic.
   ``We can no longer fly under the wedding cake,'' Ms. Weil said,
referring to the air traffic control rules that previously allowed
small planes to fly within progressively lower altitudes as they get
nearer major airports, like flying under an inverted wedding cake.
   Jerry Walbrun of the 125,000-member Experimental Aircraft
Association of Oshkosh, Wisc., said the rule will overburden air
traffic controllers.
   ``It's a little bit like trying to use computers to control
traffic in downtown Washington,'' he said, adding that the traffic
control system is not geared to watch the scores of small planes
flying well below the altitude of major airliners.
   ``The FAA has imposed a situation that will not enhance safety
and put it into effect more quickly than their own system can
handle,'' he said.
   Many pilots are faced with the prospect of either spending from
$900 to $2,000 to equip their planes with Mode C or move their
airplanes to more-remote airports.
   The FAA, in justifying the new rule, said it ``will have a major
positive impact on safety by providing air traffic controllers with
vital altitude information so potential conflicts between aircraft
can be safely resolved.''
   But last week, 18 House members sent a letter to Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner calling for him to delay implementation of
the rule until provisions can be made for access to smaller airports
that fall within the veils.
   ``The fact is that safety does not require universal installment
of automatic altitude reporting transponders,'' the lawmakers said,
adding that government should not impose unnecessary regulations
that impose ``great cost on private individuals.''
   The Congress members said that if the Mode C requirement were
limited to areas around major airports that are reached by radar,
rather than the arbitrary 30-mile limit, it would open up 600 to 700
smaller general aviation airports.
   The FAA has exempted from the rule antique aircraft, balloons and
other aircraft without electrical systems necessary to run
transponders.
   The agency also acknowledged last week that many aircraft owners
may have postponed purchase of Mode C units awaiting the outcome of
an aircraft owners' challenge to the rule, which the FAA rejected
only two weeks ago.
   To accommodate them, 90-day exemptions are being granted over the
phone. Pilots who want to fly within a restricted area can call air
traffic control authorities at the individual airport to get the
exemptions.
   The FAA also indicated longer exemptions could be given for some
operators who regularly use airports on the fringes of the veil in
areas without radar coverage or for aircraft that cannot be equipped
to handle Mode C, but written requests are required.
   The transponder rule is to be extended to 111 additional airports
at the end of next year.
   Aviation maps printed by the Commerce Department already show the
forbidden zones, so pilots have known for some time where they won't
be able to fly.

   About 3,000 people gathered in the square outside Tomasek's home
following a special Mass at nearby St. Vitus Cathedral celebrating
the Roman Catholic leader's 90th birthday.
   ``Long live our cardinal!'' the crowd chanted as Tomasek appeared
on the balcony overlooking the square. ``We want religious freedom!''
   Czechoslovakia is the only Soviet bloc country where communist
authorities have for decades blocked the appointment of religious
leaders for many of the country's 13 dioceses.
   Tomasek is a strong advocate of less state supervision of church
affairs. Church officials estimate that half of Czechoslovakia's 15
million people are Catholic.
   Earlier, about 8,000 people from across Czechoslovakia filled St.
Vitus Cathedral for the Mass. Also attending were high-ranking Roman
Catholic clergy from the Vatican, Poland, Hungary, West Germany and
other nations. Foreign dignitaries included U.S. Ambassador Julian
M. Niemczyk.
   During the Mass, a special envoy from the Vatican read a letter
from Pope John Paul II applauding Tomasek's work.
   John Paul praised Tomasek ``for all that you have patiently
endured'' and for devoting himself to the ``defense of the rights of
the church and of mankind,'' according to the letter read by Italian
Archbishop Francesco Colassuono.
   The pope's letter also mentioned Tomasek's ``pain and exile''
during his career, an apparent reference to Tomasek's 1951-54
internment in a labor camp after a communist crackdown on religion.
   In a short address, Tomasek stressed the importance of the church
in Czechoslovakia. ``Only Christ can give an answer to the hunger of
our minds for truth and to the thirst of our hearts for love,''
Tomasek said at the Mass.
   On the square, some political activists circulated a human rights
petition that has angered communist authorities.
   The petition demands the right to hold political demonstrations,
freedom for all political prisoners, and a reassessment by communist
authorities of the 1968 Prague Spring reforms, which were crushed by
a Soviet-led invasion that year.
   Communist authorities have hinted that the signatories might be
disciplined for their initiative. The Communist Party newspaper Rude
Pravo on Saturday called the petition an ``appeal to disrupt the
republic.''

<HEAD>HUD Contractors Held Millions Owed Government but Agency Rarely Noticed</HEAD>

   After David Martin, his wife and his attorney
gave up trying to audit the accounts he held as a private closing
agent in Atlanta for the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the government decided to take a crack at it.
   When HUD auditors finished the math, they said Martin owed the
government more than $1.6 million for the period 1984-1987 but had
only half that in the separate accounts he was required to keep for
proceeds from the sale of single-family homes for the agency.
   Martin's story is like dozens of others, tales that together show
an agency with little control over its private agents and even less
control over its own accounting for the hundreds of millions of
dollars the agents handle.
   In Martin's case, the auditors decided $839,812 was missing from
accounts.
   Martin's attorney protested, reminding the auditors they had
spent time at Martin's home and should be well aware of his ``modest
lifestyle and extremely modest financial base.''
   The attorney, Eugene Novy of Atlanta, said in a letter December
1987 to HUD that Martin could no longer afford to pay for legal
services and that the government's efforts to trace the money ``are
fruitless.''
   The government disagrees, and is trying to recover the money plus
interest in a $7.5 million civil suit.
   Audits of closing agents in Los Angeles, Tampa, Buffalo, Phoenix
and elsewhere produced similar findings: most of the agents were
sending HUD its money late; some weren't sending it at all. HUD,
already strapped for funds because of Reagan administration
cutbacks, was losing millions of dollars a year in interest.
   ``Delays by closing agents in remitting sales proceeds cost HUD
over $16 million in fiscal year 1987,'' the agency's inspector
general's office concluded after a nationwide audit of HUD's sales
and acquisitions of single-family homes, one of numerous agency
programs. The same report said records for the single-family program
had discrepancies involving 38,000 properties and $834 million
dollars.
   The inspector general's report, and related audits of closing
agents in several areas of the country, were obtained under the
Freedom of Information Act. They are receiving close scrutiny by law
enforcement officials and members of Congress as part of
investigations in HUD mismanagement and influence-peddling during
the Reagan years.
   The documents show closing agents, although required to wire HUD
its money within a day of completing a sale, routinely held the
money, in almost all cases at first for a few extra days and then,
as the mounting indiscretions went unnoticed, for longer periods _
weeks then months and in many cases two or more years.
   ``During a 31-month period, the escrow company remitted $109
million of sales proceeds to HUD an average of 47 days late,'' a Los
Angeles audit found. ``The delays cost HUD $1.1 million in lost
potential interest income.''
   That company, U.S. Escrow Co. of Downey, Calif., made just one of
the 1,576 payments it handled over the nearly three-year period on
time; some were up to 258 days late, HUD records show.
   The owner claimed he did not know about the payment deadline; HUD
records show it was listed in his contract with the agency and had
on other occasions explicitly discussed it with the company.
   Melvin Parsons, president of the U.S. Escrow, said in a telephone
interview that the company disputed the findings of the audit but
settled the case last year for $250,000.
   ``It was cheaper for us to settle it than to go into court,'' he
said Thursday.
   A review of 37 cases in Tampa, Fla., found that late payments
cost the government more than $18,000.
   In Buffalo, N.Y., an audit of a onetime HUD broker found that he
withheld payments, overbilled and paid himself advances from HUD
money. When he died two years ago he was almost $73,000 in arrears
to the government, and his widow later withdrew money from a HUD
escrow account, according to department records. She has agreed to
repay the money, HUD officials say.
   In Montgomery, Ala., auditors said Rick's Lind-Davis Real Estate
Co. failed to pay HUD $2 million and was late in remitting an
additional $3.8 million from sales between August 1984 to November
1987, costing the government more than $320,000 in interest.
   Federal authorities still are trying to recover that money,
according to HUD officials.
   Some of the agents mingled HUD money with private and other
checking accounts, conceivably earning interest that should have
been going to the government, according to documents.
   HUD was not detecting the late payments because of sloppy or
nonexistent record-keeping. Some office kept records on index cards;
others had so few computers that workers had to go from the first
floor to the ninth of a regional HUD office to use one.
   Many offices accepted slips requesting wire time to transfer
money to HUD instead of actual transmittal receipts from closing
agents _ many of whom never actually transferred the funds, the
documents show.

<HEAD>Architect of England's Prayers Remembered on 500th Birthday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reformation liturgy of England will flicker
briefly in a few hundred of the country's 11,000 Anglican churches
on Sunday, the 500th birthday of Thomas Cranmer, architect of
England's historic prayers.
   At St. Giles-in-the-Fields, off Charing Cross Road in London, a
special peal of bells is planned and the rector, the Rev. Gordon
Taylor, will use Cranmer's Book of Common Prayer as he does at all
services.
   Taylor is one of the few clergymen of the state Church of England
who cling to the old prayer book that appeared in 1549, when Cranmer
was archbishop of Canterbury.
   The traditionalists scorn The Alternative Service Book, written
in contemporary English and published in 1980, which was ordered by
the General Synod of bishops, clergy and laity ruling the church.
The new book has almost entirely supplanted Cranmer's.
   ``Rapid social and intellectual changes ... have made it
desirable that new understandings of worship should find expression
in new forms and styles,'' the editors wrote in the new book's
preface.
   ``I wouldn't think of using anything else but The Book of Common
Prayer, and I haven't done so in the 51 years I've been a parson,''
Taylor said in an interview.
   ``I don't understand why the old prayers were abandoned. If some
people want something else, God bless 'em, but not me,'' he said.
   Anthony Kilmister, chairman of the Prayer Book Society, which has
campaigned to keep the old prayers for most of 20 years, said he
doubted whether more than a few hundred churches would remember
Cranmer on Sunday.
   ``Cranmer was a liturgical genius who encapsulated ... the Church
of England's doctrinal standard, in a heightened English which has
become timeless,'' Kilmister said.
   ``It is sad indeed that we have not found another Cranmer to
write a modern prayer book. Perhaps it will take another 500
years,'' he said.
   Cranmer, as archbishop of Canterbury, dissolved King Henry VIII's
marriage to Catherine of Aragon in 1533 and crowned Anne Boleyn
queen. The divorce was forbidden by Pope Clement VII, and Cranmer
became England's first Protestant archbishop when the king broke
with Rome and set up the Church of England the next year.
   Cranmer encouraged the translation of the Bible from Latin into
English, ordering a copy to be placed in every church, and directed
the translation and ordering of the litany from Latin.
   He lived in turbulent times and died a martyr.
   Cranmer stood by during the king's purges and killings. He was
hated by the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I for trying to block her
accession. Under pressure, he recanted his Protestant beliefs but
finally defied the queen and went to his death at the stake in
Oxford in 1556.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie has publicly gone on
record as regretting the ouster of the old prayer book, which he
said was too hurried.
   Runcie told The Associated Press on Friday: ``Cranmer's prayers
have consecrated the souls of English-speaking people through the
centuries and enriched our language. His sense of the majesty of God
and the mercy of Christ never failed him. It was that which, with
all his faults, made him a great archbishop, a true patriot and a
sensitive Christian.''
   Runcie will open an exhibition about Cranmer at the British
Library on Oct. 26 and preach at a commemorative service in
Westminster Abbey on Nov. 7.

<HEAD>New State Laws Crack Down Harder on Drinking, Drug Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   New state laws that take effect around the nation this weekend
will make life tougher for drug dealers, rapists, drunken drivers,
drunken boaters, smokers and taxpayers.
   Children get a break in several states that are banning or
restricting teachers' use of the paddle. But two other states are
imposing a more diabolical form of punishment on teen-agers: taking
away drivers' licenses.
   Laws in many states go into effect each year Jan. 1 or July 1, so
this Independence Day weekend is seeing a layer added to the mounds
of jurisprudence that have been piling up in lawbooks since before
the states were united.
   Taxes are rising in at least five states, and the usual
collection of eccentric laws are entering the books in others.
   It's now legal to produce caviar in Montana, but illegal for
lobbyists to lend their credit cards to legislators in Tennessee.
The gopher tortoise has a new and exalted status in Georgia _ it's
the Official Reptile of the state. The Chesapeake Bay blue crab is
now the Official Crustacean of Maryland, although its only official
duty, apparently, is to get eaten.
   A survey of the 50 state legislatures suggests, more than
anything, that lawmakers are growing more desperate about drug and
alcohol abuse.
   Georgia has doubled its fines for most drug dealing convictions _
the maximum is now $1 million _ and has authorized cities and
counties to close or demolish buildings used in drug crimes.
   Indiana is extending the death penalty to include murders
committed during drug transactions. It also is requiring judges to
impose special fines on drug dealers and giving police more
authority to keep _ and use _ the property of dealers.
   ``Police were telling us they were busting drug dealers who had a
lot of sophisticated equipment, such as mobile phones and two-way
radios,'' explained Bobby Small, director of the Indiana Criminal
Justice Institute. ``A lot of the stuff seized ... would be useful
to police.''
   Washington state is enacting a comprehensive, $80 million War on
Drugs that includes stiffer prison terms and expanded education and
treatment programs. Idaho and New Mexico are imposing taxes on
illegal drugs, a ploy that is intended to ``take the profit out of
drug trafficking,'' according to Idaho Attorney General Jim Jones.
   The new alcohol abuse laws are aimed primarily at keeping
drinkers from operating vehicles _ on land, on sea and in the air.
   In Virginia, where drivers previously could sip alcohol behind
the wheel so long as they didn't get drunk, drinking while driving
is now a crime.
   A new Tennessee law allows judges to require drunken drivers to
equip their cars with ignition locking devices that measure a
driver's alcohol level. If it's too high, the car won't start.
   Colorado and Virgnia have outlawed drunken boating, while Texas
has strengthened its drunken boating law. And under a new law in
Georgia, airplane pilots can be charged with a misdemeanor if they
fly within eight hours of drinking an alcoholic beverage.
   Several states changed their rape laws. Spouses can now be
convicted of raping their partners in Indiana and Iowa. Rape
suspects in Georgia have been given new ammunition to fight the
charges against them _ they can introduce evidence in court about
the sexual background of the alleged victim.
   Three states have decided to spare children the rod, at least at
school. Connecticut, Iowa and Virginia effectively banned corporal
punishment.
   Indiana and Colorado have enacted laws that hit delinquent
teen-agers where it hurts _ in the driver's license. Indiana high
school students will lose their license if they're expelled or
suspended from school twice in a year; Colorado teens can be denied
a license if they've been convicted of any alcohol-related offense.
   New laws in Wisconsin and Minnesota are intended to keep young
people from smoking. The Wisconsin law bans the sale of tobacco to
minors; the Minnesota law strengthens similar legislation.
   Wisconsin state Sen. Joseph Andrea, a pack-a-day smoker who's
fought previous efforts to restrict smoking, said he strongly
supported the new ban. ``I don't like to see anybody smoke,'' he
said.
   Those who do smoke will be paying higher taxes in two states. The
cigarette tax goes up by 3 cents a pack in Washington state and 4
cents a pack in New Hampshire.
   But in Utah, a federal judge Friday issued a temporary
restraining order blocking enforcement of a new law barring
cigarette vending machines, intended by proponents as a way of
further restricting sales to minors.
   Gas taxes are up in New Mexico and Kansas. And Connecticut's
sales tax, which was already the highest statewide sales tax in the
nation at 7.5 percent, goes up another notch to 8 percent.

<HEAD>Communist Party Announces Investigation into Behavior of Members</HEAD>

   China's Communist Party celebrated its 68th
birthday Saturday by announcing an investigation into how its
members behaved during the recent protests for democracy. It said
some could be severely punished.
   Thousands of people took vows as new party members in Tiananmen
Square. Tourists flocked to the Gate of Heavenly Peace, which
overlooks the square and was opened to civilians for the first time
since the military crackdown last month.
   With the party's image at a new low because of widespread
corruption and the crackdown, party leaders turned to aging veterans
of the 1949 revolution to lead the internal investigation.
   Newly appointed party chief Jiang Zemin told a gathering of
several dozen semi-retired officials, most in their 70s or older,
that they were expected to help in an ``earnest rectification
extending from ideology to (party) organization.''
   The meeting was shown on national television. Not a single
youthful official was seen as the camera panned the room. Many of
those present wore hearing aids or slumped wearily in their chairs.
   The party newspaper, the People's Daily, signaled in a front-page
editorial that the shake-up would not be restricted to the party's
top levels, where it began with the recent ouster of party chief
Zhao Ziyang.
   Some party branches, it said, were ``weak and lax, and did not
carry out their roles as fortresses in battle.''
   ``The recent turmoil ... severely tested every party member,''
the editorial said. ``It is necessary to strictly check on the
performance of every party member in the struggle.
   ``Those deserving criticism and education should be criticized
and educated, and those deserving sanctions should be punished,'' it
said, adding that discipline should be severe. ``The strength of the
Communist Party is not in its numbers, but in the quality of its
members.''
   Since the army entered Beijing on June 3-4 and used tanks and
machine guns to quell student-led protests for a freer society,
party units have held frequent meetings to study the new party line
defending the crackdown.
   However, there have been no reports of party members being purged
on the grass-roots level. Many party members took part in the
student-led marches, and punishment has been expected.
   The Chinese Communist Party was founded in 1921 by a dozen men
who gathered surreptitiously in a girl's school and had flee to a
rowboat in the middle of a lake when police learned of the session.
   The People's Daily acknowledged that some Chinese have lost
confidence in the party in recent years, partly because many members
use their privileged status to sell favors or siphon off official
funds. Strengthening the 47 million-member party is a ``matter of
life and death,'' it said.
   The party also celebrated its birthday in a more lighthearted
manner with dancing and singing in Tiananmen Square, which was
opened to organized groups that had obtained permission from
authorities. The vast square, where students demanding reform staged
rallies in April and May, was filled with people taking party vows
and soldiers who sang, ``Without the Communist Party there would be
no new China.''
   The ornate 17th-century Gate of Heavenly Peace _ Tiananmen in
Chinese _ overlooking the square was reopened to all civilians for
the first time since the crackdown. More than 2,200 tourists, nearly
all Chinese, flocked to the gate, getting autographs from Gen. Wang
Fuyi, one of the army commanders who brought troops in to quell the
protests.
   Plainclothes security men, wearing straw hats or holding
walkie-talkies, stood along the marble railing from which Mao
Tse-tung's portrait hangs.
   The party's birthday celebration coincided with an American
birthday party as the U.S. Embassy celebrated Independence Day early.
   As it does every year, the embassy threw a party American
residents in Beijing. But many Americans fled Beijing when the army
moved in, and only about 200 people attended the bash, compared with
1,500 last year.
   Eight Chinese police with submachine guns took up posts outside
the embassy but refused to say why they were there. They may have
hoped for an appearance by dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, who
are wanted by police and have been hiding at the embassy.
   Education officials, meanwhile, said more attention would be paid
to ``political attitudes'' when approving student applications to
study abroad, the official China Daily reported. The step appeared
part of a series of measures to prevent people accused of joining
the protests from leaving the country.
   China sends about 8,000 students abroad to study each year.
   Official newspapers also announced the start of the trial of
three men accused of throwing paint May 23 on the portrait of Mao
that hangs from the Gate of Heavenly Peace. The People's Daily said
they were charged with counterrevolutionary actvities.
   The three _ a magazine editor, a teacher and a factory worker _
were turned over to police by student protesters who condemned the
defacing. Authorities hung a new Mao portrait hours later.
   The trial, like most in China, was closed to foreign media.

   When Jiang Zemin was named head of the world's
largest communist Party, he inherited more than a powerful position
_ he inherited a load of serious problems.
   Jiang, successor to the disgraced Zhao Ziyang, must deal with the
aftermath of the government's suppression of the pro-democracy
movement and with an economy slipping out of control.
   He also must live in the shadow of his two successors, the late
Hu Yaobang and Zhao, both purged for failing to clamp down on the
democratic impulses of youth.
   Jiang's political future seems to rest on the health of
84-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping and the desires of other
party elders who strongly believe in the communist ideology that has
ruled China for 40 years.
   ``It depends, as so much has in the last weeks, on what one old
man decides to do. That's where it becomes unpredictable, because
it's one old man,'' said an Asian diplomat who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Jiang already is being compared to Hua Guofeng, China's titular
head during the transitional years of political instability between
the 1976 death of Mao Tse-tung and the rise of Deng.
   There probably will not be more pro-democracy demonstrations in
the near future like the one crushed when soldiers drove thousands
of protesters from Tiananmen Square on June 3-4.
   But the willingness of people to put up with political repression
may be tied to how well the economy performs and to living standards.
   Premier Li Peng last fall announced a two-year austerity plan
designed to slow economic growth to curb inflation, running about 30
percent in urban areas.
   Industry was growing so quickly that it was taxing raw material
and energy supplies. Also, banks were issuing loans for new
construction and expansion without getting old loans back, adding to
the inflationary pressures.
   Li's plan has had modest success. The industrial growth rate has
been shaved from about 20 percent last year to 11 percent, and
inflation has dropped slightly.
   But factories can't pay their bills because credit has dried up,
and exporters are reneging on contracts because they lack the raw
materials needed for production.
   A deepening energy crisis is forcing factories to shut down for
days each week, and severe shortages of some raw materials have
contributed to rampant corruption. Factories often have to pay off
officials who obtain materials at low state-set prices and resell
them for handsome profits.
   Unemployment, which according to official estimates will rise to
3 percent from 2 percent this year, has caused great social despair.
Millions of people, mostly peasants from the countryside, have been
put out of work by the cancellation of construction projects and
have been left to drift from town to town looking for work.
   Premier Li's economic measures have all but stopped economic
reforms, particularly changes crucial to bringing prices in line
with market values and easing serious supply-demand gaps.
   The purge of Zhao, one of the pioneers of China's market-oriented
reforms, and his followers will deprive the nation of some of its
most innovative economists.
   ``Economic thinkers will at best be under a cloud,'' said a
Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There will
be a lot less intellectual energy.''
   Diplomats also speculated that Jiang will, like Premier Li, be
more comfortable with central planning models that Zhao tried to
dismantle.
   That would not bode well for flagging efforts to restructure
China's economic base.
   In the first three months of 1989, before students took to the
streets to demand political reforms, 22 percent of state-run
enterprises lost money. The amount of losses, made up by the state
treasury, was the equivalent of $1 billion, up 120 percent from the
same period in 1988.
   Foreign businessmen who fled when the crackdown began now are
returning, but the political turmoil could seriously affect China's
foreign business relations.
   The U.S. Embassy says a travel advisory urging businessmen and
tourists to stay away from China remains in effect. One embassy
official said safety concerns continue and cited a recent incident
in which troops fired into the air when a car driven by an American
businessman backfired as it pulled away from a military checkpoint.
   Jiang, who worked to attract foreign investment to the city of
Shanghai, where he was party chief before his promotion, may have
been picked by Deng partly to reassure the outside world that China
will keep its doors open to the West.
   But new foreign investment, which China badly needs for its
modernization drive, likely has been severely hurt by the crackdown.
   The United States, Japan and the European Economic Community have
urged international lending institutes to postpone new loans to
protest the crackdown. Such a move would deprive China of billions
of dollars in development money.
   The World Bank has deferred consideration of $780 million in
loans.
   Tourism also has been seriously hurt, cutting deeply into
earnings of more than $2 billion a year that have helped China solve
its chronic foreign exchange problems.

   The government lifted some
restrictions on citizens who want to visit or emigrate to the West,
the Communist Party newspaper said Saturday.
   Authorities no longer will require that citizens receive
invitations from family members if they want to visit the West, the
party newspaper Rude Pravo said. It said an invitation can come from
any Western resident, including emigres who left Czechoslovakia
illegally.
   Czechoslovak citizens still must apply for an exit visa when
traveling to the West, it said.
   Another new measure eases difficulties faced by families who wish
to move abroad to join relatives who have illegally left the
country. A five-year waiting period had been required before a
Czechoslovak could apply for emigration, but Rude Pravo said that
restriction was dropped effective Saturday.

   Four men fled Romania for Yugoslavia
by swimming across the Danube River, the Belgrade newspaper Vecernje
Novosti reported Saturday.
   The four showed up at a Yugoslav police station in the border
town of Kladovo on Friday, the newspaper said. One of the men was
wearing only swimming trunks.
   The newspaper gave no other details about the escape.
   Vecernje Novosti said a group of 11 Romanians escaped to
Yugoslavia last weekend, also by swimming across the Danube.
   Romania is a hard-line communist state while Yugoslavia, also
communist, has embraced more reform. Yugoslavia is at odds with
Romania over the treatment of its ethnic minorities there.
   Most Romanians who succeed in escaping across the border are
allowed to stay in Yugoslavia until they obtain visas to resettle in
the West.

   Temperatures in Tehran hit a scalding 106,
the hottest weather in the Iranian capital in 19 years, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said the heat Friday combined with a
high humidity had made the ``discomfort index'' hit 28.5 degrees.
   It gave no details on how the index was calculated, but said,
``Over 50 percent of the people don't feel well when the discomfort
index is between 21 and 24 degrees. But if it is more than 24
degrees, everyone will suffer.''

<HEAD>Aircraft Engineer Retires as Navy Employee at 89</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Navy's oldest civilian employee, an
89-year-old engineer, has retired and is going back to Germany,
where he launched a career in aviation that spanned six decades.
   Rudy Ries came to this country in 1928 and worked for 35 years
for companies that pioneered in aviation: Fairchild, Convair,
Martin, EDO Aircraft and for Fokker in the Netherlands. He helped
design pontoons for the planes flown by Charles Lindbergh to China
and by Adm. Richard Byrd to the South Pole.
   ``I've enjoyed my work, all of it,'' he said sadly at a
retirement ceremony at the Naval Training Systems Center on Friday.
``I will miss it.''
   He said he would fly to Bonn, West Germany, this weekend to live
with his son, a civil engineer posted with the U.S. State Department
there.
   The diminutive, soft-spoken Ries worked ``only'' 26 years for the
Navy Department, starting in 1963.
   Born in Frankfurt, he joined the German air force during World
War I, but he hadn't completed pilot training when it ended. In
1928, he saw the onset of Nazism in his country and came to America.
   He became a citizen in 1930, the year he joined EDO on New York's
Long Island.
   ``Lindbergh and his wife were flying to China and he wanted
special floats outfitted to the bottom of the plane, with a motor in
between, in case he landed in the water,'' Ries said.
   The Lindberghs returned to EDO after their flight to China and
had lunch with Ries and other company officials.
   ``I loaned him my pocket knife to cut his onions with, and I've
still got that knife,'' Ries said.
   Another highlight of his two stints at EDO was the design of an
all-metal airplane designed to operate at 30,000 feet, a two-seater
named the Model-R in his honor. The Depression caused the company to
cut back work on it and the Model-R was never flown.
   In 1936, Ries went to work for Consolidated Aircraft in
California, which later became Convair.
   From there, he and 20 other engineers and assistants were sent to
the Soviet Union to help in setting up an assembly plant. After
spending more than a year in the Ukraine, he got a job at Fokker
Aircraft Co. in Amsterdam. But Ries' European stay was cut short
with the approach of World War II, and he returned to this country.
   A hands-on mechanical engineer, he admitted frustration with his
profession's increasing reliance on paperwork, which he called
``letters to Santa Claus.''
   ``I enjoy engineering. I think engineering is designing things,
creating things,'' he said. ``But one thing we've turned to now is
just writing specifications ... for somebody else to build
something. I don't like this.''
   In recent years, he has designed training simulators for the
controllers who explode Tomahawk and Harm missiles when they fail to
detonate or go off course. He also is responsible for the design of
a training aid for the military's newest torpedo, the Mark 50, which
can be dropped from an airplane or fired from land or ships at sea.

   A horde of illegal aliens swarmed across the
border from Canada into the United States, but officials weren't
doing a thing about the monkey business.
   That's because the border-crashers were Japanese snow monkeys
that escaped Friday from Parc Safari African, a zoo in Hemmingford,
Quebec.
   As many as 100 monkeys swam a moat around the park and dashed
south to the border, just a couple of miles away, officials said.
   Don Dixon, animal control officer for the town of Mooers about
two miles south of the border, said he started getting frantic phone
calls Friday morning from residents reporting the monkeys on the
loose.
   The animals are mischievous but not dangerous, he said.
   State police in nearby Plattsburgh said they were aware of the
monkey invasion but could not spare any troopers to help round up
the animals.
   John Gillen, district ranger for the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, said his office was leaving the roundup
to the zoo's employees.
   Whatever monkeys elude capture by zookeepers probably will return
to the park when they get hungry, Dixon said.

   Fireflies are big game to some hunters
here and one group has made flashy profits from the incandescent
insects.
   Dorothy Anderson and her army of net-wielding firefly hunters
swarm the area nightly for the luminous bugs, which fetch a penny
apiece from a St. Louis chemical company.
   The lightning bug season, which began last month, is ``really
getting pretty doggone good right now,'' Ms. Anderson said.
   Ms. Anderson, 62, leads about 100 members of the Firefly Club of
Princeton, in north central Illinois, which is the largest of
similar organizations in the state. Members range in age from 3 to
75.
   Two years ago the club netted 600,000 lightning bugs, which
brought $6,000 in profits, and by the end of last week it has caught
33,000 fireflies this summer, bringing in $330.
   It's not uncommon for firefly hunters to make $5 every evening in
about 20 minutes, Ms. Anderson said.
   ``It makes good spending money for them,'' she said. ``And at the
same time, it's being done for a good purpose.''
   Ms. Anderson sends the captured fireflies to the Sigma Chemical
Co. in St. Louis. The company removes the section of the insect
containing luciferin and luciferase, chemicals which have hundreds
of medical and scientific uses, including detection of cancer cells.

   After weeks or months in U.S.
government custody, airborne Central American deportees finally had
a leisurely meal and a choice: chicken or fish.
   There were no more guards giving them five minutes to eat at the
crowded U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service detention camp
near the Mexican border city of Brownsville, Texas. Aboard the TACA
International jetliner, they enjoyed courteous service from flight
attendants.
   No more dressing ``like a carrot'' in the orange INS detainee
jump suits issued at the ``corralon'' _ the big corral _ their
nickname for the INS Port Isabel Service Processing Center.
   The 59 Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans devoured the
airline food on the way to San Salvador.
   They clowned and laughed a lot for people who had spent
everything for a better life in the north, and failed.
   The drudgery of detention made even the poverty and violence back
home seem better.
   ``These are the unfortunate people, no money,'' Isidro Ramirez,
an officer at the South Texas immigration jail, said while
overseeing their departure from the camp. ``The only place they got
to visit in America was this.''
   They did not know when they would leave until their names were
called on a recent day on the camp loudspeakers.
   INS officials returned the clothes, money and few possessions the
aliens had when apprehended, took a second set of fingerprints,
compared faces with booking photos and herded them onto a bus.
   The INS Harlingen District in southern Texas is the closest U.S.
border crossing point to Central America. The district spent $1.8
million last year to operate the detention camp, not including
salaries, and another $425,000 on deportations, mostly on air fares
to Central America.
   The deportees included 668 Salvadorans, 317 Hondurans and 312
Guatemalans.
   Nationwide in fiscal 1988, the United States deported 2,711
Salvadorans, 2,049 Guatemalans, 1,312 Hondurans and 36 Nicaraguans.
   On the seven-hour bus ride to Houston, Manuel Martinez, 22,
lamented his failure to get a job in the United States but looked
forward to seeing his daughter born during his three-month detention.
   ``That's why it's not so bad to go back,'' said Martinez, an
ex-soldier in the Salvadoran army.
   He said he fled his home in the eastern province of San Miguel
because he was desperate for work and because of threats from
leftist guerrillas fighting the government.
   Few of the deportees had bothered to apply for political asylum
in their appearances before an immigration judge because friends
told them it was not worth suffering an even longer detention only
to be turned down.
   Asylum is granted only to those judged to be fleeing political
persecution.
   This group of deportees had a false start. Their bus had to turn
back halfway to Houston because of flooding.
   ``Send the airplane here to pick us up,'' shouted Maria Reyna
Quintanilla, 24, another native of San Miguel, when INS officer
Joseph Russell announced it would be impossible to get to the
Houston airport that night.
   ``I have bad luck,'' said Jorge Valencia Marin, 30, who lives
near San Salvador, wondering why he could not even get deported when
he was ready. ``I was already looking forward to seeing my family
again.''
   The next day, the bus reached Houston. The deportees arrived
about 1:30 a.m. and slept on the floor of an area the INS leases in
an industrial park near the airport.
   The airplane flight was the first for most of them.
   But not for Juan Montufar Alvarez, 29, a Guatemalan who spent the
trip reading his Bible. It was his third time to be deported from
the United States and his third plane trip.
   At the airport in San Salvador, the Guatemalans and Hondurans
were transferred to flights for their countries.
   The Salvadorans waited in an immigration line near a wall with
posters showing a little girl with one leg and the caption,
``Innocent victim of FMLN (guerrilla) mines. What about her human
rights?''
   The more than 30 Salvadoran deportees were told to wait at the
immigration desk until the pilot brought their package of
deportation papers. Then they were waved through, without
interrogation or a search of their luggage by the soldiers
downstairs in camouflage gear.
   Several had no money and stood in front of the airport
bewildered, wondering how they would make it 20 miles to the capital
and then home.

   Americans in Beijing celebrated an early Fourth of
July on Saturday with a barbecue and imported beer but without the
street dances and rock music that characterized previous years'
bashes.
   Only about 200 people showed up for the cookout on the patio of
one of the three U.S. Embassy compounds in Beijing's main diplomatic
sector. That compared to the 1,500 who attended the block party last
year. The 1988 bash featured rock bands as well as McDonald's
hamburgers that the fast-food chain flew in from Hong Kong.
   Many Americans fled Beijing when China declared martial law in
May and when troops moved last month to crush student-led protests
for democratic reforms.
   At noon on Saturday, eight police guards armed with submachine
guns appeared around the embassy complex but refused to say why they
were there. They may have hoped for an appearance by dissident Fang
Lizhi and his wife, who are wanted by police and have been hiding at
the embassy.
   It was the first time in weeks that guards outside the embassy
had weapons. Police guards with handguns are stationed outside each
diplomatic mission in Beijing, but since the military crackdown June
3-4, their holsters have been empty.
   ``I wouldn't read a lot into it,'' said McKinney Russell,
director at the embassy of the U.S. Information Agency. ``Every time
there's any kind of movement, the police presence is stepped up.''
   The Chinese outside the embassy gate were police normally
assigned to the embassy, according to a U.S. Marine guard who said
he knows them well.
   ``Same guys, new guns,'' the Marine said.
   The guards were stationed around the U.S. facility temporarily
and will scale back their numbers after July 4, one of the guards
said.
   About 70 police showed up at the Fourth of July party last year,
diplomats said.
   ``I didn't think that was excessive,'' said one Foreign Service
officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They were there to
keep Chinese from looking in at us through the bars, but they ended
up looking at us through the bars.''
   There was no extra security at the July Fourth party in 1987,
according to diplomats who were in Beijing then.

   A cab driver, angered when a woman pulled out a
$20 bill to pay her fare, shoved and struck a man who came to her
aid _ who happened to be a taxi commissioner, authorities said.
   Cabbie Victor Nelson had his license suspended and faces
permanent revocation over Friday morning's incident, said Taxi and
Limousine Commission spokeswoman Barbara Hart.
   The incident began when the woman, whose name was withheld, tried
to pay Nelson with the $20 bill at the end of her trip. Nelson
``flew off the handle and got irrational,'' said Hart.
   At this point, TLC board member H. Laurence Reinhard spotted the
altercation while driving past and stopped to investigate.
   ``I identified myself and showed him my badge and he hit me in
the left shoulder,'' said Reinhard. ``When I reached for his ID, he
pushed me.''
   No criminal charges were filed against Nelson, but his cab was
impounded and his license quickly suspended, said Hart.
   ``Drivers are not required to change a twenty, but they must be
courteous,'' she explained.

   Anti-abortion activists anxiously
awaiting a possible Supreme Court decision Monday on abortion rights
are gearing up for what they see as the next phase of their campaign
_ war in the states.
   The National Right to Life Committee, which was winding up its
three-day convention here Saturday, is hopeful the high court will,
at the very least, return authority to the states to decide whether
to restrict abortion.
   If that happens, there's a realistic expectation that
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, probably Minnesota and possibly Ohio could
be among the first states to consider abortion curbs, said Burke
Balch, the committee's state legislative coordinator.
   State action on abortion laws would depend on various issues,
including timing _ many legislatures don't convene again until 1990
or 1991. ``What we're talking about is an extremely long, hard
struggle here,'' Balch said.
   A Missouri case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, is
pending before the Supreme Court and a decision is expected Monday.
Missouri's law puts restrictions on abortions and defines life as
beginning at conception. Upholding the Missouri law, or even parts
of it, could reverse or seriously erode the 1973 landmark decision,
Roe vs. Wade, legalizing abortion.
   Many abortion opponents here believe a total reversal of Roe is
highly unlikely. But they feel this court is their best chance since
1973 to return the issue to local lawmakers and, thus, give abortion
opponents the chance to advance their goals on a state-by-state
basis.
   Restrictive steps that Balch said would be most likely to be
introduced are parental consent and notification laws, and measures
to give fathers a say in abortion decisions.
   A parental consent law that was to have taken effect Saturday in
Tennessee was struck down Friday by a federal judge who declared the
law unconstitutionally vague.
   Abortion foes say that if the Supreme Court upholds even part of
the Missouri law, it would be a victory and a signal to forge ahead.
   ``If it goes in any direction in our favor ... the first step
you'll see is politically and legislatively a great push ... in all
50 states,'' said Paul O'Donnell, a Franciscan brother attending the
convention. ``The pro-life movement is just going to move forward
and intensify.''
   ``This is phase II,'' he said. ``The first phase was 16 years
ago,'' when Roe vs. Wade was decided.
   ``It's going to be a state fight, whatever happens,'' said Sam
Lee, a Missouri anti-abortion activist and an architect of the
measure before the high court.
   Abortion opponents already are talking about special legislative
sessions, petition drives and increased lobbying efforts.
   ``The legislators are feeling the faint heat coming down the pike
and it's just getting hotter,'' said Brenda Hucks, director of South
Carolina Citizens for Life. ``They're (also) going to feel heat from
pro-abortion folks and the media. They'll be in the spotlight.''
   Lawmakers ``have had some easy dodges,'' said Roger Mall,
director of the Iowa Right to Life Committee. They'd say, ```Call me
when we can start doing something.' Now, they're going to have to
come out of the closet one way or another.''
   The National Abortion Rights Action League said in a June report
that both legislative houses in nine states _ Alaska, Colorado,
Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, New Mexico, North Carolina, Virginia and
Washington _ along with the city council in Washington, D.C., favor
keeping abortion legal.
   The report also said 24 legislatures favor making abortion
illegal and governors in 15 of those states support such actions.
   But abortion opponents won't make such distinctions.
   ``We're not counting any state as a loss,'' said Jacki Ragan,
head of the committee's state organizational developmental
department. ``We're not counting any state as a given. All will be
battlegrounds. We're going to give it all we've got.''
   They also say they're braced for the possibility of defeat _ but
remain undaunted.
   ``We're not about to pack up and go away,'' Miss Hucks said.
``We're in it for the duration. It's more than a passing interest.
It's a bone-deep commitment.''
   ``It's our belief that whatever the result in the Webster case,
that the decision in Roe vs. Wade is in fact doomed,'' said James
Bopp Jr., the committee's general counsel. ``It is simply a question
of when it will be reversed, whether it will be in this case or the
next case or the next case. But it is inevitable.''

<TEXT>
   Tourists on Saturday climbed atop the newly
reopened Gate of Heavenly Peace overlooking Tiananmen Square, mixing
with plainclothes police and crowding for autographs from a general
whose troops crushed student protests on the square.
   About 20,000 civilians and soldiers earlier celebrated the 68th
birthday of the Chinese Communist Party in the vast and immaculate
square, which thousands of soldiers captured June 3-4 from students
and supporters demanding democracy.
   The gate reopened to the public today, but those in Tiananmen
Square needed the approval of martial law officials.
   In the square, thousands of people were sworn in as party
members. Groups of helmeted soldiers marched by, holding AK-47
machine guns in their white-gloved hands.
   Hundreds sang a children's song that has been heard frequently in
the weeks since the crackdown: ``Without the Communist Party, there
would be no new China.''
   More than 2,200 tourists visited the ornate 17th-century gate,
which sits on the square's northern end and is the main entrance to
the former Imperial Palace.
   Nearly all the tourists were Chinese, but the evening television
news showed a couple identified as Americans.
   Chinese visitors paid $2.70 _ two days' wages for many workers _
gathered at the gate where revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung
declared the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1,
1949.
   Plainclothes security men, wearing straw hats and holding
walkie-talkies, stood along the marble railing from which Mao's
portrait hangs.
   Tourists crowded to get an autograph of Gen. Wang Fuyi, one of
the army commanders who brought troops to quell the student protests
that the government called ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   Other tourists jostled for autographs from Beijing Vice Mayor
Zhang Baifa, who accompanied Wang. Many crowding for autographs said
they did not know Zhang or Wang and were just following the others.
   A woman from the northeastern province of Liaoning who arrived in
Beijing two days ago said she did not know what had happened in the
capital, where official reports say about 300 people died in the
military crackdown.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say the death
toll could be as high as 3,000.
   ``Everybody says it is all right now,'' she said.
   A woman from eastern Shandong province claimed she didn't even
know the protests and crackdown had taken place. Her only interest
was in having another traveler take her picture atop the gate.
   Vehicles and bicycles were allowed to drive around Tiananmen
Square but were not allowed to stop.
   Students demanding democracy, press freedom and a clean
government demonstrated in the square for seven weeks until the
military crackdown. Officials say there was no firing inside the
square itself and that no deaths took place there, but student
witnesses dispute this.
   The Monument to the People's Heroes inside the square, which the
students used as a podium during their protests, was draped Saturday
with two long crimson banners proclaiming, ``Long Live the Great
Chinese Communist Party'' and ``Firmly Support the Communique of the
Fourth Central Committee.''
   It was at the party Central Committee's fourth session last
weekend that party Secretary General Zhao Ziyang, who sympathized
with the students, was ousted.

<HEAD>Botha Says Farewell to Military in One of Last Public Appearances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha addressed a
military awards ceremony Saturday in what was expected to be one his
last public appearances before retiring.
   The 73-year-old leader, reportedly embittered over pressures from
his own political supporters to quit, kept his emotions in check in
a farewell to the South African Defense Forces, with which he has
been associated 23 years.
   But his voice cracked when he said, ``I thank you and greet you.
God bless you,'' at the end of the ceremony. He awarded medals to 21
soldiers for bravery in the conflict against guerrilla forces in
Namibia and Angola.
   South Africa has agreed to grant independence to Namibia, its
colony for 74 years, under a regional peace accord that also
provides for Cuba to draw its 50,000 troops from Angola. The Cubans
backed and helped train fighters of the Southwest Africa People's
Organization, which battled South African forces.
   Botha's appearance at the ceremony came two days after he
declined to attend a congress of his governing National Party, where
delegates approved a reform that envision giving the black majority
a greater voice in national affairs.
   Botha suffered a stroke in January. Party officials cited this as
one reason for replacing him as party chief and urging him to step
down as president after parliamentary elections in September.
   While not referring directly to the party's reform plan, Botha
declared that the country was ``involved in conflict on a front much
broader than just the military. We are called on to stand up and be
counted _ for our national values and interests, our traditions,
religious freedom, private enterprise and our very right to exist as
a free nation.
   ``We know the measure of our freedom depends on our sense of
responsibility and devotion. The whole of South Africa can benefit
from it.''
   Botha served as defense minister before becoming prime minister
and then president.
   Armored personnel carriers, long-range artillery and other pieces
of military equipment were displayed in a two-hour parade past the
reviewing stand in front of Cape Town's city hall, where canopies
protected the dignitaries from the rain.
   Col. Hans Stempsler, chief spokesman for the Defense Forces,
denied press reports the event was arranged especially to bid
goodbye to Botha. He said it was an annual event.

<TEXT>
   A former U.S. Navy intelligence analyst who
defected to the Soviet Union killed himself by inhaling carbon
monoxide, and his last wish was to be buried in his KGB uniform,
official media said Saturday.
   In providing details for the first time about Glenn Michael
Souther's death June 22, the official Tass news agency said he
``went to the garage, started his car, closed the garage door and
lay down on the back seat of the car leaving the door half open. The
car filled with carbon monoxide.''
   His body was discovered the next morning when he failed to appear
for a ride to work, Tass said.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda said Souther, 32, was considered
a top Soviet spy. ``He belonged with such outstanding soldiers of
the invisible front as Kim Philby and George Blake,'' British
intelligence officers who spied for the Soviet Union.
   Souther defected in 1986 when the FBI began investigating him and
joined the Soviet secret police, the KGB. When he defected, the
Hammond, Ind., native was working as a satellite photograph analyst
at the Navy's 2nd Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va.
   Pravda said he had access to ``the most valuable documents on the
top secret plans for use of the U.S. Navy in a nuclear war against
the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.''
   Tass described Souther as a ``man with a great soul, a romantic
who was very impressionable and sensitive.''
   It said as an intelligence officer, he lived under constant
strain. ``He had a nervous breakdown,'' Tass said.
   Souther, who took the Soviet name Mikhail Orlov after he
defected, wrote a letter to his colleagues at the KGB containing his
last request, according to the news reports.
   ``Justice demands you hear my last words. I do not regret our
relationship. It was a longstanding one, and helped me grow as a
person,'' the letter said. ``I wish to be buried in the uniform of
an officer of the KGB.''
   Neither Tass nor Pravda said whether the request was granted, but
KGB chief Gen. Vladimir Kryuchko said on Wednesday that Souther was
given a military funeral Monday.
   Previous Soviet news reports said Souther's parents traveled to
the Soviet Union for the funeral.
   Pravda said Souther had become disillusioned with some aspects of
life in the Soviet Union and that his colleagues noted he suffered
occasional bouts of depression.
   ``Of course, not everything Glenn met in the Soviet land was as
he had expected,'' the newspaper said. ``For example, he could never
comprehend that it is possible to drop into a store and be unable to
find some needed item.''

   Barbecues are easier. Still, devoted
New Englanders scramble for the right seaweed, the right rocks and
the right canvas for a traditional July Fourth clambake.
   And a couple of hundred enthusiasts have even been willing to
spend $50 and head back to college to learn how to do it right.
   Terry Parker, 48, said he signed up for the University of Rhode
Island's clambake course because last year he had a July Fourth
clambake for about 100 people and it was a disaster.
   With roughly $1,000 invested in food, they salvaged what they
could and ``boiled it on a propane stove,'' said his friend, Dana
Jones, 32.
   In contrast to a barbecue, which in New England may simply
involve throwing steaks onto a portable grill, a clambake requires a
pit with white-hot rocks on which a mix of seafood is steamed or
baked with potatoes, corn and other ingredients. Many people hire
commercial bake masters.
   ``To have a clambake that doesn't work is very embarrassing,''
Parker said.
   The course, offered for three years through URI's Narragansett
Bay Classroom, is hardly a typical academic experience.
   While students arrive with pen and paper _ one even brought a
video camera so he wouldn't forget a thing _ they also brought
suntan lotion and cold beer.
   Nonetheless, ``They're really into it,'' Parker said. ``People
are here to learn how to do clambakes.''
   About 200 students have taken the non-credit class in the seven
times it has been offered, said Sarah Hickox, Bay Classroom
coordinator and assistant director of URI marine programs. It is
usually a full class, she said.
   At 9 a.m. on a recent Saturday, on a hill overlooking
Narragansett Bay, class began.
   ``The water was calm, the sun was up and the beach was empty. It
was gorgeous,'' Parker said.
   Class began with a study of tide charts to determine where and
when to collect the seaweed that will cover the rocks. Preparation
of the pit was next, then how to coordinate the fire and rocks.
   ``He taught us what rocks to use and what rocks not to use. I
wasn't aware of it,'' Jones said. The wrong type of rocks break
apart under the intense temperature of the steaming food and release
the heat.
   There was ``a lengthy dissertation on seaweed,'' Parker said.
``One can be used and is very effective,'' while the other type
doesn't generate enough steam to cook the food without scorching it.
   ``The trick is to keep the seaweed from burning. You want it to
boil,'' Jones said. It's also important to get untreated canvas to
cover the food as it bakes.
   ``I'm really amazed it's as scientific as it is,'' Parker said.
``I guess there are a lot of things that can go wrong.''
   The class assignment was to find the right seaweed. So 20
students headed to the beach.
   ``You should have seen us collecting the seaweed down there,''
said Carolyn Gaudreau, 45, of Marlborough, Conn. ``I thought eight
(bushel) baskets would take us a couple of hours, but it only took
us about 20 minutes.''
   The steamers were purchased, as were mussels, fish fillets,
lobsters, sausages, sweet and white potatoes, corn on the cob, and
onions.
   ``My family did clambakes ... years ago, but I never paid much
attention to it,'' said Roberta Baker, 49. ``I've never put one on
myself. That's what I'd like to do.''
   A lot of New Englanders are fascinated with the mystique of a
traditional clambake, Hickox said.``What this does is allow them to
do something that appears very complex in their own back yard.''
   While the food cooks, the students sample clam chowder and crab
cakes made earlier in the day. Less than an hour later, bake master
Thad Gruczka tests the cooking time by sticking a knife in the
nearest potato.
   ``If the potatoes are done, the bake is done,'' said Gruczka,
chairman of the science department at South Kingstown High School.
   Final exam _ the taste test.
   ``When it comes to seafood, there just isn't any better eating
than a bake,'' said Fred Creighton, 19.

   President Najib has agreed to release
an American photographer captured while traveling with Moslem
guerrillas, a senior PLO official said Saturday.
   Najib gave the assurance that Tony O'Brien would be freed in
response to a personal appeal by Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman Yasser Arafat, said Arafat's special envoy, Abu Khalid.
   ``He told me that there will be no trial and that O'Brien will be
released shortly,'' Khalid told reporters.
   He said he met O'Brien and that the American was in tears when he
learned of his imminent release.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
O'Brien might be released when Arafat visits Kabul this week to try
to mediate a settlement in the Afghan civil war.
   ``He is no more in jail or being interrogated. He is in a
house,'' said Khalid. He did not elaborate.
   O'Brien, who did not have a visa to enter the country, was
arrested by Afghan security forces on June 8 at a rebel hideout in
Kabul. He has not been formally charged with a crime.
   The 43-year-old native of Santa Fe, N.M., had been covering the
war between Najib's soldiers and the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas,
who are based in Pakistan.
   He was on assignment for Time-Life Inc. when he crossed into
Afghanistan with the insurgents, known as mujahedeen or, Islamic
holy warriors.
   The guerrillas have been fighting to overthrow Afghanistan's
Marxist government for 11 years.
   Khalid arrived in Kabul, the nation's capital, on Thursday to
discuss a PLO proposal to end the fighting. The proposal calls for
an immediate cease-fire and peace talks.
   ``If we can bring them to the negotiating table, that will make
at least the beginning,'' he said.
   The guerrillas have refused direct talks, insisting that Najib
and key members of his government relinquish power. Najib has said
he will not step down until he has guarantees that his departure
will bring peace to Afghanistan.

   A thief has dealt a blow to the ad campaign
for Sylvester Stallone's upcoming movie ``Lock Up.''
   ``This was very important for us,'' producer Chuck Gordon said
after learning someone stole five ``trailers,'' or promotional
previews that are run in theaters.
   The theft occurred Friday when a courier driving the five film
canisters to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport left
his car to get coffee, said Gordon.
   ``I don't know what they'd be worth to somebody, but it was worth
a lot to us as far as exposure,'' the producer said.
   The stolen trailers were scheduled for screenings in Los Angeles
during this weekend's anticipated box office bonanza spawned by the
``Batman'' release.
   In ``Lock Up,'' co-starring Donald Sutherland, Stallone plays an
underdog in prison. The movie will be released nationwide Aug. 4.

   Country music singer K.D. Lang says her
androgynous appearance has drawn both good and bad attention.
   ``I think my persona definitely has caused attention,'' she said
in an interview. ``Whether it's negative or positive, it's
definitely generated some sort of interest. And I think it's good,
because I think a lot of women have felt trapped for a long time,
felt the need to conform to the sequined gowns and stuff.''
   The short-haired Lang often uses no makeup, and sometimes dresses
up in clothing associated with men.
   ``I'm aware of how alternative my looks are in comparison with
other women. I get flak for it. I've felt resistance to it,'' she
said.
   Lang has just released her third album, ``Absolute Torch and
Twang.'' She is known for her duet with the late Roy Orbison on a
remake of Orbison's hit, ``Crying.''

   Cecil Andrus has been elected Idaho governor three times and was
Interior secretary under President Carter. Frank Church, who died in
1984, was a senator for 24 years and ran for the Demcratic
nomination for president in 1976.

   Solidarity legislators decided Saturday
against offering Lech Walesa as a presidential candidate because the
political system is not yet democratic enough, a spokesman said.
   The opposition lawmakers also decided to withhold taking a stand
on the communist party's choice for president until just before the
meeting of the National Assembly, which will choose the president.
That meeting is expected sometime this week.
   The legislators said it would be best if there were more than one
candidate.
   ``We are waiting for decisions of the coalition around the Polish
United Workers (communist) Party as to what candidate it will
recommend. Or rather what candidates,'' parliamentary deputy
Bronislaw Geremek told state television after the meeting.
   The leader of the communist party, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski,
announced Friday he did not want to be a nominee and he endorsed
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak. The party has asked
Jaruzelski to reconsider.
   Solidarity legislators met Saturday to decide what stand to take
in relation to the election.
   ``As goes for the candidates from the coalition (communist) side,
we will assume our stand on the eve of the election _ that is on the
eve of the first session of the National Assembly,'' Solidarity
parliament deputy Janusz Onyszkiewicz told a news conference.
   During the daylong debate, Solidarity considered putting up its
own candidate. The obvious choice would be Soldidarity leader Lech
Walesa, Onyszkiewicz said, but he added, ``The time is not good for
Walesa now.''
   ``We are not in a democratic system and we don't think that Lech
Walesa should be the president in this system which is not fully
democratic,'' he said. Walesa said in the past that he would not run
for president.
   The president, who is limited to two six-year terms, will be
commander-in-chief of the armed forces and be responsible for
foreign relations. He may dissolve Parliament for new elections and
declare one 90-day state of emergency.
   The Sejm, or Parliament, and the Senate will convene in separate
sessions for the first time July 4. Their first joint session as the
National Assembly is expected later in the week. That is when the
president will be chosen.
   Officials want the president in office before President Bush
arrives for a three-day visit July 9.
   The communist coalition has a 300-259 advantage, but there are
some internal divisions.
   Communist party spokesman Jan Bisztyga said Friday a meeting will
be held to choose between Jaruzelski and Kiszczak before the
National Assembly meeting.
   Among the options considered at the Solidarity meeting were the
possibilities of finding a party or neutral candidate the opposition
could support.
   Some people at the meeting, including Walesa, said it would be
best if there were several candidates, not one, said Onyszkiewicz,
who is also national spokesman for the Solidarity trade union.
   In an interview on state television Saturday, Walesa said the
president needed to be someone who could unite all Poles.
   Jaruzelski is linked to the 1981 martial law crackdown, in which
thousands of union activists were interned. Solidarity was outlawed
the following year. The communist party chief cited this association
in the public eye as his reason for not wanting to be a candidate.
   Kiszczak helped crush Solidarity after martial law, but he won
back confidence from the opposition by leading the government in
negotiations that led to Solidarity's legalization and the elections
for the National Assembly.
   The elections were the freest in Poland since World War II and
included opposition candidates for the first time.

   More than 150 abortion foes were arrested Saturday as activists
on both sides of the issue took to the streets two days before the
U.S. Supreme Court was expected to rule on a Missouri abortion law.
   Arrests reported Saturday morning included 103 in Philadelphia
and 40 in Romulus, Mich.
   Terry McNitt, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia group, said more
than 100 people protested for 2{ hours by kneeling or sitting in
front of the doors of the Northeast Women's Center.
   Police said the 103 arrested were released and will be charged
later. He said they probably will be cited for defiant trespass.
   The center's acting administrator, Diane Straus, said the center
was scheduled to perform more than 30 abortions Saturday. She said
several women decided to reschedule their appointments but no one
canceled, but McNitt said one woman left with an anti-abortion
counselor instead of going to her appointment.
   In Michigan, about 400 protesters, some favoring abortion rights
and some opposed, descended on a clinic in the Detroit suburb of
Romulus.
   The 40 persons arrested on trespassing charges were trying to
block the entrance to the Northland Family Planning Clinic, said
police Sgt. Dan Snyder. They were released and ordered to appear in
District Court by July 17. No assaults were reported, he said.
   ``I believe we are here in the spirit of repentance to stop
abortion,'' said Vickie Brown of Wixom, Mich. ``I will never use
physical force but will be here until justice prevails.''
   Smaller protests were also reported in Des Moines, Iowa, and
Durham, N.C., with seven arrests at each city by early afternoon.
   In Des Moines, about two dozen protesters were still marching on
the sidewalk in front of the Planned Parenthood clinic Saturday
afternoon, and three police paddy wagons were on hand. The seven
persons arrested earlier in the day were charged with disorderly
conduct.
   In past protests at the site, the anti-abortion protesters have
purposely been arrested en masse after sitting down at the
building's entrance. But on Saturday, individual protesters were
arrested as they approached women entering the building.
   ``We're just trying to tell them that we've got families to help
them save their baby,'' said abortion protester Dave Leach.
   Abortion supporters gathered across the street from the clinic in
a counter-protest and solicited pledges for contributions based on
the number of abortion opponents expected to be arrested. The
pro-choice demonstrators said they hoped to raise $1,000 for Planned
Parenthood.
   Seven persons were charged with trespassing in Durham, N.C., for
sitting in front of the doors of a medical center. They were
released on $100 bond a short time later. They were part of a group
of more than 50 abortion opponents who gathered to sing, picket and
pray outside the center.
   The Supreme Court was expected to issue a ruling Monday on a
Missouri law that restricts abortion and defines life as beginning
at conception, or hold over the entire case for new arguments during
the 1989-90 term.

   The chairman's plan was simple: Let members of
the House Armed Services Committee load down the defense bill with
so many pork-barrel amendments it would collapse under its weight.
   Such a bill never materialized.
   The committee did vote to restore money for the V-22 Osprey
helicopter and F-14D Tomcat fighter by reducing spending for the B-2
stealth bomber. But it refrained from any other major additions and
found the money by cutting other programs.
   Then _ against the advice of Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis. _ the
committee chose a $295 billion defense bill that reflected its own
procurement priorities rather than those proposed by Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``A leaner, meaner version,'' Aspin said a day after the
Wednesday vote as he compared the final committee package to the
$7.1 billion in add-ons members had originally sought.
   Members of the panel explained that their plan remained within
Cheney's budget numbers. They also expressed dismay with pressure to
rubber-stamp a proposal crafted by a defense secretary just 39 days
on the job.
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., joined with Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., and
Norman Sisisky, D-Va., to save the V-22, the tilt-rotor aircraft
that is manufactured by Boeing Helicopter Co. in Pennsylvania and
Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., in Texas.
   Their amendment also restored money for the F-14D, which is built
by Grumman Corp., on Long Island.
   To get $157 million for the Marine Corps' V-22 and about $1
billion for the Navy's F-14D, the lawmakers reduced spending on the
MH53 helicopters and canceled multi-year purchases of the E-2C and
F@A-18 aircraft.
   The other amendment approved by the committee provides about $1.2
billion for the National Guard and reserves by reducing $500 million
in procurement money for the Air Force's B-2 and $524 million that
had been earmarked for Air Force aircraft spares and repair parts.
   Cheney, commenting in a statement the day after the vote, said
Congress wants to cut defense spending but doesn't want to cancel
any systems.
   ``We must not preserve the fiction that we can keep all the
weapons and bases everyone wants and still spend less money,'' the
defense secretary said.
   Weldon disagreed, saying his amendment ``does not affect the
bottom line of Cheney's budget.''
   The Pennsylvania Republican said it was unfair to cancel the V-22
on the eve of testing the aircraft, which is designed to take off
like a helicopter and fly like a plane.
   ``I like Dick Cheney but he got advice from pencil-pushers,''
Weldon said.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said that based on the dollar
amount, Cheney ``got 95 percent of what he wanted.''
   But the ranking Republican on the Armed Services panel, Rep. Bill
Dickinson of Alabama, criticized the vote, calling it a ``bad day
for good government'' because the panel failed to face the reality
of a budget crunch and allowed business as usual.
   Dickinson expressed the hope that this will change when the full
House takes up the defense bill.
   But Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., who voted against the Cheney
budget, objected to the ``good government'' argument.
   ``It's incumbent upon me to exercise my judgment not acquiesce to
the secretary of defense,'' Dellums said. ``I've been on the job
more weeks than he. ... I've written nine military budgets.''
   Dellums said there was some resentment among Democrats on the
committee that the chairman suggested his ``own membership should
not have a right to assess a budget.''
   Only nine of the panel's 31 Democrats supported Aspin's amendment
to accept the Cheney budget.

   New York City's famed five boroughs could
someday become four.
   The Legislature, working into early Saturday morning in an
end-of-session marathon, voted to give Staten Island residents a
chance to say whether they want to secede from New York City.
   If Gov. Mario Cuomo signs the bill, residents of the smallest
borough might be able to vote in November 1990 on whether to take a
bite out the Big Apple. Cuomo said Saturday he hadn't decided what
to do.
   Polls say Staten Island residents overwhelmingly favor secession,
an issue tied up with a court-mandated restructuring of the largest
U.S. city government.
   ``We didn't start out with the idea of leaving the city,'' said
state Sen. John Marchi, a Staten Island Republican. ``We just wanted
to maintain our voice in the city. We didn't have anything against
the city of New York. I ran for mayor there twice.''
   The secession movement gathered steam after the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled in March that the Board of Estimate, which governs city
spending and construction, was unconstitutional because it gave
Staten Island's 400,000 residents equal representation to the more
populous boroughs, such as Brooklyn, with more than 2 million people.
   Staten Island residents fear the city charter revision
commission's plan for revamping city government will shortchange
their borough.
   ``It would reduce us really to colonial status,'' Marchi said.
   Cuomo said he believed the legislators' action was not an
approval of secession, but simply a ``political statement. What they
are saying is `Staten Island ought to be protected.''' Cuomo said he
shared those sympathies, but wasn't sure how to go about providing
such protection.
   Cuomo is from Queens. Manhattan and the Bronx are the other two
boroughs.
   Residents of Staten Island have never considered themselves true
New York City residents, said Elizabeth Connelly, a Staten Island
Democrat who shepherded the secession bill through the state
Assembly.
   She noted, though, that the borough's more upstate character has
lessened since the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge linked it with Brooklyn
and it began absorbing people fleeing high housing costs and other
urban woes in other boroughs.
   Many leaders from the other boroughs, including Mayor Edward I.
Koch, a Manhattanite, fear the loss of tax revenue to the city if
Staten Island secedes.
   Lawmakers who opposed the bill also argued that all New York City
residents should have the right to decide if part of the city should
break away.
   ``It's fundamentally unfair to all the other residents of the
city of New York ...,'' said Assemblyman Anthony Genovesi, a
powerful Brooklyn Democrat. ``I don't think that anyone has
considered the ramification of how it all works out.''
   Connelly argues that Staten Island residents never had a say in
the 1898 decision by the Legislature that made the island a borough
of New York City.
   The 1989 bill calls for Staten Island voters to decide two
questions: whether Staten Island should break from New York City and
whether it should form a county or city type of government. The
legislation won't allow a secession vote unless a charter revision
is voted on in a citywide referendum this November.
   Even if the secession decision is a long way off and by no means
a certainty, it's already unifying a borough that's been the butt of
jokes, Marchi said.
   ``There is a lot of excitement,'' he said. ``I'm telling you, it
doesn't make any difference _ rich or poor, black or white, fat or
skinny. It doesn't make any difference.''

   Gorbachev spoke for the first 25 minutes of the nightly
television news show Vremya in a rare personal appeal to the nation
that is home to more than 130 nationalities.
   Gorbachev called on all Soviet citizens to bring an end to ethnic
strife that has emerged in several Soviet republics over the past
two years.
   ``As president of the U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet, I consider it my
duty to warn you about the mounting danger'' of exacerbating ethnic
tensions, Gorbachev said in the speech. He also warned of ``related
consequences for society, for every family and every person.''
   Gorbachev's appeal follows outbreaks of violence in the republics
of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Georgia. Last year, ethnic clashes
erupted in the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   The most recent violence was in Kazakhstan. Four people died in
the city of Novy Uzen last month when rioters attacked immigrants
from the Caucasus region, accusing them of setting up private
business and finagling privileges in housing and other benefits.
   In June, violence between ethnic Meskhi Turks and native Uzbeks
in the republic of Uzbekistan left about 100 people dead, officials
said. Josef Stalin ordered the migration of the Turks to the
republic in 1944.
   In April, 20 Georgians died in clashes with Soviet troops sent in
to end a a pro-independece demonstration.
   Gorbachev, whose own policies of tolerating greater openness and
dissent have emboldened groups seeking more autonomy, blamed ethnic
violence on the forced migrations of ethnic groups ordered by his
predecessors.
   ``Today, we are reaping the fruits of lawlessness in preceding
decades _ the deportation of whole peoples from their lands and the
burying in oblivion of the national intersts of small ethnic
groups,'' Gorbachev said.
   He said that all people had to obey the laws of the land that
guarantee a citizen's rights and warned that ``the state will uphold
these rights by all means at its disposal.''
   Gorbachev said some people were taking advantage of ethnic
frictions for personal gain. ``This is playing with fire. Those who
have embarked on this path are assuming gravest responsibility
before their own people and before society as a whole,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said most of the violence had taken place in instances
where ethnic groups constitute a minority in small communities.
   ``What will happen if interethnic discord spreads over to regions
where millions of people of other nationalities live along with
people of the indigenous nationality?'' he asked.
   He said every citizen regardless of nationality should have their
rights protected, ethnic groups should be allowed to freely develop
their own language, and culture and political and ethnic reform is
needed in the 15 Soviet republics.
   Gorbachev said Communist Party members and intellectuals should
use their influence to quell ethnic passions.
   ``All of us indeed cannot but be disturbed by the interethnic
intolerance, frictions and even conflicts eupting lately, now here
and now there, disrupting people's lives and resulting in a number
of cases of human tragedies,'' Gorbachev said.

<HEAD>New Cigarette-Machine Ban Gets Last-Minute Reprieve From Judge</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-New Laws, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Provisions of a new Utah law prohibiting
cigarette vending machines were put on hold by a federal judge, less
than 12 hours before the law was to have taken effect Saturday.
   U.S. District Senior Judge Aldon J.Anderson issued a temporary
restraining order banning enforcement of the challenged section of
the law after an emergency hearing Friday.
   ``Sales until this matter is resolved will be the same as under
the old law,'' Anderson ruled.
   Four vending-machine companies had filed suit against the state
Friday morning, requesting that the Adolescent Tobacco Prevention
Act, passed by this year's Legislature, be declared unconstitutional.
   Anderson's ruling prevents the vending-machine provision of the
law from taking effect for at least 10 days.
   The vending machine ban, which won widespread support from
lawmakers, is aimed in part at curbing uncontrolled access to
cigarettes by minors. It would prohibit all cigarette
vending-machine sales except in bars, private clubs or offices and
other work areas not open to the public.
   A second hearing was scheduled for July 7 to determine whether a
preliminary injunction should be issued until the law's
constitutionality can be tested.
   The plaintiffs claim a ban on vending machines will drive them
out of business without restricting sales to minors any more than
current law, which already requires employees of businesses having
cigarette machines to check customers' ages before enabling the
machines to work by remote switch.
   The restraining order presented ``no threat of change in the sale
of cigarettes to minors'' since a cashier must still check the age
of the person buying cigarettes, Anderson said.
   The judge made his decision despite the state's claim the lawsuit
is not a proper question for a federal court.
   ``We do not feel there is a constitutional issue and therefore
the plaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits,'' said assistant
attorney general Linda Luinstra, who argued the case involved
questions that should be challenged in a state court.
   But plaintiffs' lawyer Richard Rappaport said the law deprives
his clients of business without any rationale.
   ``There is a public interest in having children not smoke,'' he
said. ``There's no public interest in having adults buying
cigarettes hand-to-hand over the counter instead of having adults
buy cigarettes from a machine after the business owner determines
they are adults.''
   Over the past week and before Friday's ruling, many of Utah's
vending machine companies were busy removing cigarette machines from
restaurants, hotels and other public places in anticipation of the
new law.

   When Martin Alsobrooks was hired as an
animal technician at a research laboratory here, nobody told him the
monkeys he'd handle likely would carry a virus that could kill him.
   Less than three months later, one of his co-workers is dead, a
former co-worker is hospitalized and Alsobrooks and about 30 current
or former colleagues are on an experimental anti-viral drug they
hope will stem the rare disease in case they, too, have been
infected.
   The herpes B virus, better known as the monkey virus, is found in
more than 50 percent of rhesus monkeys, a type of macaque. The virus
is harmless to the animals, but more than half of the 30 cases
documented in humans since the disease was first reported 57 years
ago have been fatal. It's commonly transmitted through bites and
scratches.
   ``I try not to worry about things I have no control over, but my
family is worried. My mother is lighting candles,'' said Alsobrooks,
33, whose blood test results were inconclusive.
   Thousands of these monkeys are being used daily in laboratory
experiments nationwide. While progress is being made in the area of
animal welfare rights, the conditions in which lab employees work
are largely unregulated by federal or state law.
   Officials at International Research and Development Corp. say
they have complied strictly with guidelines set by the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta and that the two technicians who were
infected did not report their wounds.
   Tom McGeorge, a 23-year-old technician, died June 20, just a few
days after the virus was diagnosed. The hospitalized former
employee, whose name is being withheld, is in serious condition. He
worked at the company only one week before quitting this spring.
   Early detection was impossible since neither man reported his
injuries, which is required by the company, said Francis X. Wazeter
III, IRDC vice president.
   When an employee reports being bitten or scratched by a monkey, a
disinfectant is promptly applied to the wound to kill the virus,
Wazeter said.
   Some employees said bites and scratches were so common and the
pressure to complete studies so great that it was nearly impossible
to report each wound to the company nurse.
   Wazeter denied there was pressure on employees to work fast and
said reporting wounds is mandatory. He also denied allegations by
several employees that the leather gloves used by monkey handlers _
part of the extensive protection gear _ usually had holes and took
months to replace.
   The CDC's guidelines, which are not enforced by any regulatory
agency, were created two years ago after a herpes B outbreak in
Pensacola, Fla., killed two monkey handlers and infected two other
people.
   Some current and former employees at the lab believe a high
turnover rate, poor training, and heavy workloads played a part in
the outbreak of the rare disease, which has been documented only 30
times since the first case was reported in 1932, said Dr. Gary
Holmes, a CDC epidemiologist.
   The disease, which attacks the brain and central nervous system,
frequently leads to encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, and
then to death. Since the virus has been documented, 16 of the 24
patients who have shown symptoms have died, Holmes said. In one case
in Pensacola, the virus was spread person-to-person.
   Of about 135 blood tests conducted on current and former IRDC lab
employees who had contact with the monkeys in the last two months,
81 were negative and five were inconclusive, Michigan Department of
Public Health officials said. The rest of the results are expected
this week.
   The company, which employs 350 people, does animal research for
medical, pharmaceutical, veterinary and agricultural companies.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Prepares To Release Damaged Tanker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greek tanker that ran aground and spilled
420,000 gallons of oil in Narragansett Bay last week was inspected
Saturday as its crew prepared to move it to a drydock for repairs,
officials said.
   The Coast Guard's Lt. Paul Wolf said officials from New York
inspected the vessel, the World Prodigy, to make sure there would be
no problem bringing it into New York Harbor for repairs.
   A tugboat was scheduled to arrive late Saturday night and the
ship was tentatively scheduled to leave on Sunday, Wolf said.
   The tanker has been anchored off the south coast of Rhode Island
since it struck a rock on Brenton Reef on June 21, tearing two large
gashes in its side and dumping 420,000 gallons of home heating oil
near the mouth of Narragansett Bay.
   A Coast Guard officer who conducted three days of hearings into
the accident last week concluded the accident was probably caused by
human error.
   The captain, Iakovos Georgudis, 43, has admitted he erred in not
waiting for a pilot before entering the treacherous waters close to
the mouth of the bay.
   A federal magistrate late Friday released the ship and Georgudis,
who faces two federal misdemeanor charges he violated pollution
laws. Georgudis' bail of $50,000 was wired to a local bank. A state
grand jury is also considering charges against Georgudis.
   Magistrate Jacob Hagopian said he released the ship at the urging
of the Coast Guard, which wants to see it repaired. Hagopian said
his order would contain a provision that the ship be towed.
   Wolf, however, said the ship would move under its own power,
accompanied by a tug, to New York Shipyard, on the site of the old
Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York City. He said h was not aware of
Hagopian's order.
   Coast Guard officials would be on board the ship, along with
Georgudis and his crew, for the 20-hour journey, Wolf said.

   A former volunteer firefighter was
acquitted of a series of arson fires that terrorized this community
last summer, and residents say they are troubled once again.
   ``I think the town is going to be in turmoil,'' Fire Chief Jim
Kenison said after a jury in neighboring Lancaster on Friday
acquitted Lance Lalumiere, 23.
   ``I'm scared, I'm scared of what's going to happen,'' said
Kenison. ``I'm concerned that, because of (the verdict),
repercussions are going to happen, one way or the other.''
   Kenison said the community of 800 again will be afraid of the
fires that last summer had residents sleeping in shifts and guarding
property with guns.
   Paige Matson, owner of the Skywood Manor Motel, where Lalumiere
once lived, said Lalumiere's acquittal brings new problems.
   ``I'm scared for him, I'm happy for him,'' Matson said. ``I'm
just praying that they don't come after him again.''
   Matson said she is afraid the fires will start once again
``because they haven't caught the arsonists. I think the fires will
start up stronger.''
   When Lalumiere was asked by reporters what he wanted to do first
after eight months behind bars, he replied, ``Thank God.''
   He said he will return to Jefferson and stay with a brother, Rene.
   The Coos County Superior Court jury reached its decision Friday
in its second day of deliberations, ending a three-week trial.
   Defense lawyer James Quay said he wasn't surprised by the verdict.
   ``Lance has a lot of family support in Jefferson,'' he said.
   Lalumiere was charged with setting 11 fires and trying to set two
others out of 26 fires in the White Mountains community.
   No one was injured in the fires, but they caused about $1 million
in damage. They began with brush fires, but soon escalated to barns
and homes. Most began in the dead of night at the rear of buildings.
   Lalumiere, described by his lawyers as slow, suffering from a
learning disability and functionally illiterate, admitted he set the
13 fires and three others, but later recanted. His lawyers said the
admissions were coerced. Three charges were dismissed before Friday.
   The state was ``disappointed, but we definitely feel the evidence
went in as well as it could,'' said Assistant Attorney General
Andrew Serell.
   ``There is no evidence linking anyone else to any of the charges
(that were filed) against Mr. Lalumiere,'' Serell said. ``If any new
evidence came to light, it would be pursued.''
   Lalumiere is the second person charged and acquitted in the
fires. Larry Coulter Jr., a current Jefferson firefighter, was
charged in October with one count of arson, later reduced to
criminal trespassing. He was acquitted of the lesser charge in April.

<TEXT>
   A tanker carrying badly needed fuel broke
through Syria's blockade of the Christian enclave, sparking a fierce
artillery duel that killed three people and wounded 16, police said
Saturday.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, said it was ready to cut off vital
arms supplies to the Christians to help Arab League peace efforts.
   There was no immediate reaction from Christian leader Gen. Michel
Aoun, the army commander and head of a Christian Cabinet vying with
a Moslem Cabinet to lead the government.
   The official Iraqi News Agency in Baghdad quoted a Foreign
Ministry spokesman as warning the Syrians not to ``take advantage''
of the Iraqi move or ``commit any aggression against other parties
in Lebanon.''
   There was no immediate comment from Syria.
   The Christians have relied heavily on the Iraqi arms shipments,
including T-54 tanks and multibarreled rocket launchers, in their
confrontation with the Syrians and their Moslem militia allies.
   The Arab League so far has failed to halt the fighting, which
began March 8.
   The Syrians and their allies imposed the land and sea blockade on
the 310-square-mile Christian enclave on March 14. The blockade has
caused a serious shortage of gasoline and oil and has turned the
once-bustling area into a ghost town.
   Aoun's Cabinet has been buying gasoline abroad and shipping it to
the Christian enclave in small tankers. Syrian artillery pounds the
Christian coastline daily to stop the ships, and one was hit and set
ablaze a few weeks ago.
   Police declined to say how much fuel was aboard the ship that
made it through Saturday.
   A Christian source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
``small tanker ventured through Syrian shellfire'' Friday night to
anchor in a small bay about 15 miles north of Beirut.
   He said the tanker unloaded its cargo of gasoline and sailed out
before dawn Saturday. He declined to identify the ship.
   ``The Syrians opened fire at the departing tanker. Aoun's gunners
fired back to provide the ship with cover. The ship made it through
the blockade and headed to Cyprus, but the exchange escalated and
spread,'' the source said.
   A spokesman for Aoun refused to comment on the fighting.
   The casualties brought to 385 the number of people killed since
the fighting began in March; 1,515 have been wounded.
   A police spokesman said Syrian forces were firing six shells and
rockets a minute for some periods before dawn.
   The barrage hit the Ashrafiyeh and Ein Rummaneh districts of
Christian east Beirut, the coastline north of the capital and wooded
valleys east of the waterfront where Aoun's artillery batteries are
deployed, the spokesman said.
   He said Aoun's gunners retaliated with 155mm howitzer fire on
Syrian artillery emplacements along west Beirut's seaside boulevard
and the mountains overlooking the city.
   The spokesman said the Christian gunners ``scored several direct
hits on Syrian artillery emplacements in west Beirut.''
   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported seeing a
Syrian army ambulance rushing to scene shortly before dawn.
   Syrian headquarters in Beirut refused comment.
   As the firing intensified around daybreak, families rushed for
cover in underground shelters and basements.
   The barrage eased about 8 a.m. and police said hundreds of
families left west Beirut for safer areas in southern Lebanon and
the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon.
   Police said a similar evacuation was reported in east Beirut,
with Christians headed for the mountains northeast of the city.

<TEXT>
   Neighbors of the uranium processing plant in
Fernald said they were pleased with the government's proposal to pay
a $73 million settlement in a lawsuit charging the plant polluted
the environment.
   But leaders of the Fernald Residents for Environmental Safety and
Health said Friday that the plant's owner, the U.S. Department of
Energy, must still be watched to ensure it continues to clean up the
1,050-acre site.
   ``We're not done yet,'' said Lisa Crawford, spokeswoman for the
citizens group. ``It took us 4{ years to win this battle. This is
just the first part. The next step is to get it cleaned up.''
   Terms of the settlement, approved by Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins late Friday, will be the subject of a hearing scheduled Aug.
24 before U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel in Cincinnati. It
calls for the government to pay at least $73 million and no more
than $78 million.
   Mrs. Crawford, who lives two miles from the plant, said the
settlement provides funds for medical monitoring of the residents
and their children to track any adverse effects of radioactive
pollution.
   ``For all of us, it's very important to have medical monitoring
after all that we've been put through,'' she said. ``The biggest
thing is that we've shown the world that the DOE is wrong, that what
they did to these people was wrong.''
   Stanley M. Chesley, the lawyer who negotiated the settlement for
the neighbors, said money is also included for studies to analyze
the extent of cancer in the area and help residents detect it as
early as possible.
   ``Early detection is early cure in cancer,'' Chesley said. ``Now
we can afford an opportunity for everyone to have early detection.''
   Chesley filed a $300 million class-action lawsuit in Spiegel's
court on behalf of 14,000 people living within five miles of the
38-year-old plant where the government processed uranium used in
making nuclear weapons.
   The residents alleged in their suit that pollution from the plant
18 miles northwest of Cincinnati caused them mental stress and
devalued their property.
   Spiegel presided over an unusual mock trial that ended June 15
when a jury's non-binding verdict recommended the residents be
awarded $136 million. Chesley credited the mock trial for
encouraging the settlement.
   The defendant in the case was National Lead of Ohio, the
contractor that operated the plant for the government from 1951
through 1985. The current operator, Westinghouse Materials Co., was
not involved in the suit.
   Chesley said the settlement is significant because it kills the
Energy Department claim that National Lead of Ohio was not liable in
the case because it took its actions on orders from the U.S.
government.
   Under the contract, the government was required to pay damages
assessed against NLO, said Energy Department lawyer Henry Gill Jr.
   The Energy Department has admitted that the plant has released
more than 300,000 pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust into the
atmosphere through faulty exhaust-air filters during its history.
But the department denies that pollution from the plant has hurt
neighbors' property values.
   ``A lot of that is hysteria,'' said deputy Energy Secretary
Henson Moore. ``There really wasn't, judging by what I heard ... a
lot of hard evidence of anybody losing anything _ as a matter of
fact, almost none.''
   If Spiegel approves the settlement, the government must deposit
the money into four Cincinnati banks no later than Oct. 15, said
Louise Roselle, one of the lawyers who represented the neighbors.

<TEXT>
   Traveling shows featuring dwarf-tossing contests
are the latest outrage dwarfs find themselves fighting to preserve
their dignity and safety, officials of the Little People of America
Inc. said Saturday.
   ``Dwarf-tossing may help financially the person who does it. ...
However, it tears down the structure and the esteem that little
people are trying to gain,'' said association spokesman Ernie Ott.
   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez signed a state law last week banning
the barroom sport, helping short-statured people fight a lingering
perception that they are ``non-persons,'' Angela Van Etten, a member
of the Committee to Ban Dwarf Tossing, said at the association's
annual conference.
   ``It occurs in a bar and a consenting adult little person allows
a stranger in the bar to pick him up and see how far he can throw
him. The persons in the bar get prize money for throwing him the
farthest,'' Ms. Van Etten said.
   ``The people in the bar ... all stand around laughing and think
this is one huge joke,'' she said.
   Dwarf tossing and dwarf-bowling, in which a helmeted dwarf
strapped to a skatebard is used as a human bowling ball, have been
made part of traveling entertainment shows and have been reported in
South Carolina, North Carolina, New Jersey and New York, she said.
Efforts to outlaw the practice in several states are under way.
   The association also issued a statement opposing the use of
bone-lengthening surgery to make dwarfed children taller. The
association said bungled surgery has crippled patients and forced
amputations.
   A record 1,000 dwarfed people and their families were expected at
the conference that began Saturday to attend clinics on medical
treatments, watch a dwarf fashion show, compete athletically and
dance nearly every night of the week.
   ``During the year, you go dancing with your husband and you're
the only little person on the floor. You end up with a jab to the
right and a jab to the left,'' as well as curious stares, said
conference co-chairwoman Dee Miller. ``So, dancing is very important
to us.''
   Kristen Pohlman, 17, said dwarfs travel across the country to
attend the conference because it is their only chance to socialize
with others who understand and accept them.
   ``It's a dream world. It's a real shock when you get back home,''
said Miss Pohlman, who believes she is the only dwarf in Panama
City, Fla.
   ``It's hell sometimes. Once a kid in a toy store came up to me
and said, `Oh, you can talk.' She went up to her dad and said,
`Daddy, buy me one of those,''' she said.
   The association was founded in 1957 by entertainer Billy Barty,
an actor who recently was featured in the movies ``Willow'' and
``Legend.'' The organization bills itself as the largest national
organization representing people of short stature.
   Most dwarfism is genetic, but it usually does not strike all
members of a family, and it can be caused by more than 100
disorders, Ott said.

   A mother who made a tearful appeal on television
for the return of a toddler who she said was snatched from a
hospital lobby actually staged the kidnapping with a friend, police
said.
   Marilyn Galvan, 28, was arrested Friday and charged with filing a
false report, and her friend Sonja Rijo, 33, was charged with
endangering the welfare of a child, said a police spokesman, Sgt.
Pete Berry.
   Ms. Galvan retained custody Saturday of 16-month-old Christian,
who was returned to her unharmed about 12 hours after he was
reported missing Tuesday, Berry said.
   ``The mother and friend planned the hoax kidnapping in an effort
to make Galvan's estranged husband feel guilty,'' Berry said. The
husband was not involved, he said.
   Berry said inconsistencies in Ms. Galvan's statements had aroused
suspicions among police, who originally credited her television plea
with persuading the kidnapper to promptly free the boy.
   The child was found by a passer-by on a sidewalk not far from the
hospital where the alleged kidnapping occurred.
   The two women were released with orders to appear in court July
31.

<HEAD>Ship Reported Bound For Iran With Nerve Gas Ingredient Docks In Dubai</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iran-bound ship believed
carrying chemicals used in making nerve gas docked in Dubai Saturday
and unloaded unidentified cargo, shipping executives reported.
   The 5,608-ton West German-flagged Seacrest Pioneer, which came
from Bombay, India, was earlier reported by West Germany's ZDF
television network to be carrying thionyl chloride, a component used
in manufacturing deadly mustard gas.
   Dubai is a major transshipment point for Iran-bound cargo.
   ZDF said the ship would be stopped before reaching Iran, quoting
unidentified government sources in Bonn. But shipping executives
reported no moves to seize the freighter's cargo in Dubai.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, Saturday denied that a
shipment of chemicals to manufacture chemical weapons was bound for
Iran. It said the reports were perpetrated by the United States and
indicated renewed American hostility toward the Islamic republic.
   West German prosecutors announced Saturday they opened a criminal
investigation into the Rheineisen Chemical Products Co. of
Dusseldorf, which reportedly contracted to deliver 257 tons of
thionyl chloride to Iran. The firm is run by an Iranian family.
   The shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Seacrest Pioneer discharged containers at Hamriya, the
smallest of Dubai's three ports. They said that at dusk the vessel
would be reloaded with a new unidentified cargo and would prepare to
sail back to Bombay.
   They described the new cargo as ``normal containers'' but said
they could not identify the goods being loaded.
   ``The discharged containers were stacked at the port without any
apparent restrictions,'' one source said on condition of anonymity.
``The unloading and loading operations went smoothly to all
appearances.''
   The source also said port officials told him they had received no
orders from the government to confiscate any of the cargo.
   The Seacrest Pioneer docks in Dubai about once every two weeks on
regular runs across the Indian ocean.
   Rheineisen Chemical Products officials said earlier they halted
the alleged shipment of thionyl chloride that arrived in Bombay on
Wednesday. They deny any wrongdoing and say they have government
approval for the shipment to India.
   The New York Times Saturday quoted an Indian government official
as saying the New Delhi government's State Trading Corp. sold Iran
60 tons of thionyl chloride in March.
   The official was quoted as saying the chemical was shipped from
Bombay. He said the sale did not violate Indian laws because the
chemical is a freely traded commodity often used in pesticides. But
is also a component of so-called mustard gas, which is used in
warfare because of its irritating, blistering and disabling effects.
   The reports follow an international uproar six months ago over
the involvement of West German companies in building a factory
outside Tripoli, Libya. Washington said the factory would be used to
make poison gas but Libya said the plant will produce
pharmaceuticals.

   The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cape Town, the
Most Rev. Stephen Naidoo, died Saturday at his sister's home,
officials said. He was 51.
   Naidoo, who suffered from a heart condition, went to London after
being advised by physicians to take three months of rest, the
Catholic Media Office said. He collapsed at his sister's home in
Merton, south London, where he had been resting for two weeks.
   Naidoo's Cape Town archbishopric made him one of the most senior
members of the 2.5-million strong Catholic community in South Africa.
   Born Oct. 23, 1937, in Durban, Naidoo was ordained a priest June
29, 1961. After spending 14 years working abroad, he returned to his
native country in 1974 and was consecrated a bishop on Sept. 15 that
year.
   Naidoo was serving as auxiliary bishop and and vicar general in
the Cape Town diocese in October 1984 when he was chosen to replace
Cardinal Owen McCann as archbishop.
   Although an outspoken critic of Pretoria's apartheid policies,
Naidoo was not as public a figure as other churchmen, including
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Allan Boesak, president of the
World Alliance of Reformed Churches.

   Police in mobile booking trailers arrested 235
people in a crackdown on gangs over the Fourth of July weekend.
   Of the 235 people arrested Friday night, 136 were suspected gang
members, and the sweep was to continue Saturday night, police said.
   ``We want the good people in this community to feel your
presence'' Assistant Police Chief William Rathburn told officers
before they swarmed through gang-infested neighborhoods in the first
widespread dragnet for drug-dealing street thugs since the highly
publicized sweeps dubbed the ``Hammer'' last summer.
   Forty-nine of Friday night's arrests were for felony narcotics
violations and two were for misdemeanor narcotics violations. Other
arrests involved weapons charges, outstanding felony warrants and
driving while intoxicated.
   There were 452 gang-related slayings in Los Angeles County in
1988, surpassing the 387 such killings reported the year before.
   Authorities blamed the record level of bloodshed on fierce turf
and drug battles fought by well-armed street hoods.

<HEAD>Three of Four Nuns Barricaded in Monastery Leave After Almost Nine
Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three of four Roman Catholic nuns,
who barricaded themselves in a monastery nearly nine months ago to
protest liberalization of their austere order, ended the standoff
Saturday, a diocesan spokesman said.
   The fourth woman, whose temporary vows expired earlier in the
year, remained in the infirmary at the Monastery of the Most Blessed
Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, said Timothy Manning of the Paterson
Diocese.
   Five of the 13 Carmelite nuns at the monastery barricaded
themselves in the infirmary Oct. 4, saying they feared eviction for
protesting a new prioress' introduction of television and sweets.
   Manning said Saturday's action was a surprise. ``We're presuming
that the realization finally hit them that if they wanted to save
their vows, they were going to have to leave.''
   Manning said the diocese had planned to deliver an order Monday
demanding the nuns leave the monastery.
   The nuns had maintained they would not leave the building until
they were ordered to by the Apostolica Signatura, the highest court
of the Vatican.
   The nuns have twice ignored orders from lower-level Vatican
officials.
   Lynn Williams, formerly Sister Teresita, was the only nun
remaining at the infirmary Saturday. She hung up the telephone when
reached by a reporter seeking comment. There was no answer at the
main monastery number.
   The location of the other nuns was not known, Manning said.
   Betty Sutton, a lay person who has acted as a spokeswoman for the
nuns, said she did not know where they went.
   ``This came as a total surprise to me,'' Ms. Sutton said. ``I
didn't know they were leaving.''
   She said she spoke to the rebel nuns two days ago and they said
they were frustrated the case had dragged on so long. The remaining
nun had shared that attitude, Ms. Sutton said.
   ``I can't imagine what they're thinking,'' she said. ``Unless
their parents influenced them, but that's just a supposition.''
   Ms. Sutton said she had spoken with Sister Eliane, who lives in
the monastery and has been a spokeswoman for the nuns.
   ``It's very disturbing,'' she said. ``We just don't understand
how this happened so quickly.
   Sister Eliane said in an interview last week that she believed
the nuns would remain until the Apostolica delivered its ruling. ``I
don't see any movement or anything that they're leaving,'' she said.
   The last Vatican letter, received May 31, told two of the nuns to
seek another monastery, informed one that her temporary vows had
expired and allowed a 71-year-old nun to stay on the condition that
she obey the monastery prioress.
   A fifth nun, Nicole Prescott, left the monastery March 19, citing
health reasons. Prescott, then known as Sister John of the Cross,
served as the spokeswoman for the group when their case received
international attention.

<HEAD>Strike-Bound Radio Station Off Air After News Editor Threatened by
Gunmen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Radio Soleil, Haiti's most popular
station, went off the air Saturday after the news editor said he was
threatened by gunmen and fired along with five other employees in
the midst of a strike.
   Venel Ramarais, news chief at the Roman Catholic Church-run
station, said two gunmen stopped him in front of the station's gate
Saturday morning, waved a pistol in his face and threatened to kill
him.
   Ramarais said the station's management was ``indifferent'' when
he told officials of the confrontation.
   He said he and five other employees were fired two hours later
when management decided to clamp down on the strike and stop
broadcasting.
   The station has encouraged the poor to fight social injustice.
But since April, Haiti's conservative Bishop's Conference has fired
a total of 10 of the station's 42 employees. It appointed the Rev.
Arnaud Chery as station director in an apparent move to check the
influence of radical priests and employees.
   ``For about three months the new heads of the station have been
running it with an antagonistic spirit,'' which led the staff to
strike, the employees said in a release this week.
   Chery could not be reached for comment Saturday.
   Ramarais said he did not notify police of the confrontation. In
Haiti police rarely respond to citizens' complaints; they could not
be reached for comment.
   During the last months of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier's rule in
1986 Radio Soleil was the only station broadcasting news. Duvalier
fled to exile in France in February 1986.
   A group of 60 parish priests said in a release Thursday that they
will celebrate Mass together Sunday and stage a procession in a show
of support for the strikers.

   A Cuban court-martial formally indicted 15
high-ranking military officers on charges of high treason and
trafficking in cocaine, diamonds and ivory, Cuba's official media
said Saturday.
   The 15, including former Interior Minister Jose Abrantes and
former major general and war hero Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, were
stripped of their rank and expelled from the Communist Party last
week.
   They were formally indicted by the military court in a meeting
late Friday and early Saturday, said the official Prensa Latina news
agency, monitored in Mexico City.
   If convicted, the 15 could face the firing squad.
   The news agency said the court reconvened Saturday afternoon. It
said the proceedings were attended by the Cuban press and senior
government officials but gave no details.
   Dispatches from Havana said the defendants belonged to a secret
division of the Interior Ministry that smuggled medicines, hospital
supplies and computers to circumvent a U.S. trade embargo.
   Prensa Latina said the military prosecutor, Brig. Gen. Juan
Escalona Reguera, told the court they conspired for 2{ years to help
Colombia's Medellin cartel smuggle cocaine into the United States
and also dealt in diamonds and ivory.
   Escalona dismissed as ``absurd'' arguments by Ochoa and some of
the other accused that they dealt in cocaine to earn dollars to help
Cuba's faltering economy, Prensa Latina said.
   The accused made these claims before a separate military tribunal
on Tuesday and Wednesday that stripped them of all rank and
decorations and recommended a court-martial.
   Escalona was quoted as saying the 15 tried to damage ``the
prestige of the Cuban Revolution and sully the image of the officers
of the armed forces and those of the Interior Ministry.''
   Escalona called drug trafficking ``an inhuman and criminal''
enterprise.
   ``The trial is being carried out with all procedural guarantees
established by Cuban legislation and they (the accused) are
represented by their corresponding defense counsels,'' Prensa Latina
said.
   The court was made up of three major generals.
   Ochoa, who was a much decorated war hero, took part or directed
fighting in Angola and Ethiopia and served on missions in Venezuela
and to help Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista regime.
   President Fidel Castro on Thursday replaced Maj. Gen. Abrantes
with Maj. Gen. Abelardo Colome Ibarra, a confidant of Castro and the
third-highest ranking officer after Castro and Defense Minister Raul
Castro, the president's brother.
   The Communist Party has also expelled Diocles Torralba, a former
vice president and transportation minister for ``serious violations
of ethical, political and administrative principles.''
   Torralba, who was fired by Castro as minister of transportation
last week, was under arrest along with several others accused of
corruption, the Mexican government news agency Notimex said. It gave
no details.

   Wildcat strikes by an estimated 37,000
coal miners are threatening the health benefits of 85,000 retired
miners and widows, the president of a coal industry group said
Saturday.
   Joseph Brennan, Bituminous Coal Operators Association president,
said in a statement that health benefits to retirees and widows are
funded through hourly contributions by the coal companies. He said
the wildcat strikes have cut off much of the fund's income.
   ``There must be an end to these strikes _ or the fund will
collapse and thousands of people will lose benefits,'' Brennan said.
   The health benefits program cost $200 million per year or $4,000
per working miner, and the fund has lost $20 million since last
year, Brennan said.
   Miners began wildcat strikes _ strikes without formal union
sanction _ June 12 to protest the Pittston Co.'s refusal to sign a
contract with the union and to protest the past jailing and $3
million fines levied against the union and its members.
   United Mine Workers spokesman Joe Corcoran could not immediately
be reached for comment Saturday on Brennan's allegations. There was
no answer at his home, and he did not return a message left at his
office.
   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp ordered the wildcat strikers
back to work, but for the most part, his order has been ignored. Up
to 46,000 miners had been out in 10 states, and as of Friday 37,000
miners in eight states were still out.
   About 1,900 UMW members are on an authorized strike against
Pittston in Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., joined a growing list
of West Virginia politicians who say they are frustrated with
Pittston's reluctance to resume negotiations with the union.
   On Friday, Pittston formally rejected a second offer by West
Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton to mediate talks.
   Rockefeller aide Lane Bailey said Friday that the senator has
grown impatient and accused Pittston of ``foot-dragging and
posturing.''
   ``He sees the strike as threatening the major export markets for
our coal, and that's something he's worked very hard on,'' Bailey
said.
   The senator's aide said Rockefeller had been in contact with UMW
President Richard Trumka and Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas urging
the two sides to resume negotiations.

   Rain from Tropical Storm Allison fell over much of the South and
Southwest on Saturday, and remnants of the slow-moving storm flooded
hundreds of Mississippi and Louisiana residents out of their homes.
   More than 100 homes were flooded in Bolivar County, Miss., where
nearly 5{ inches of rain fell since midnight. Up to 3 inches were
expected overnight in the already-saturated northern half of
Mississippi.
   In the southwestern Louisiana town of Oakdale, about 200 people
remained out of their homes because of the threatening Calcasieu
River, said Mayor George Mowad.
   About 40 homes held 6 to 7 feet of water, with less in another 20
to 30 homes, Mowad said. U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
guards helped Louisiana National Guard troops patrol the streets,
Mowad said.
   Residents of a Lake Charles subdivision took pot-shots at
alligators and water moccasins swimming through 6-foot-deep water
around their houses.
   The storm dumped 15 to 20 inches of rain on west central
Louisiana in the last five days.
   Many streets were flooded in Arkansas City, Ark., after 3{ inches
of rain fell Saturday morning, and thunderstorms dumped 2{ inches of
rain in one hour at Alvin, Texas.
   Rain and thunderstorms also extended from portions of the central
Plains into the Ohio Valley.
   Heavy rain was reported in southeast Kentucky and Florida, and a
severe thunderstorm in Alabama blew trees down at Chatom.
   Scattered showers were reported in the Pacific Northwest and in
extreme northern New England.
   Partly cloudy skies prevailed in the East, where temperatures
ranged from 75 to 85 degrees.
   Clear skies and low humidity across much of the West allowed
temperatures to fall below freezing at some summer resorts Saturday
morning. In the Lake Tahoe area, the mercury at Truckee, Calif.,
fell to 23 degrees, making it the coldest spot in the nation, and in
South Lake Tahoe it was 26 degrees. At Bryce Canyon, Utah, the
temperature was 29 degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees in Hoquiam, Olympia, Bremerton and Quillayute, Wash., to 107
degrees in Phoenix.
   The forecast for Sunday called for showers and thundershowers
over eastern sections of the southern Plains, across the lower half
of the Mississippi Valley, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the Gulf
Coast states and the south Atlantic Coast states, with showers and
thunderstorms most numerous over Alabama and the Ohio Valley;
widespread showers over the Pacific Northwest; and widely scattered
showers in northwest Montana and northern Maine.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 80s and 90s across most of
the nation, in the 60s and 70s in the Pacific Northwest, in the 70s
along the California coast and in northern Maine, and 100 to 110
degrees from southwest Texas to much of New Mexico and the desert
Southwest.

   Police clashed with residents
holding a community meeting in the black homeland of Bophuthatswana
on Saturday, and nine officers and two civilians were killed, local
news reports said.
   Officers in the town of Leeufontein, 150 miles northwest of
Johannesburg, were investigating an ``alleged illegal gathering when
they were attacked by a large crowd of people with petrol bombs,
axes and stones,'' the South African Press Association quoted police
officials as saying.
   In an earlier report, the Press Association said the deaths
occurred when police fired on the meeting with automatic rifles and
people at the meeting retaliated.
   Clashes between local citizens and police have been reported in
Leeuwfontein and nearby Braklaagte since they were incorporated into
Bophuthatswana last year. In March, police in Braklaagte were
accused of beating people who refused to declare themselves citizens
of Bophuthatswana.
   Critics say such boundary changes in South Africa have deprived
thousands of people of South African citizenship and the job
opportunities and other advantages that go with it.
   Police Col. D.A. George was quoted by the Press Association as
saying he was unsure what the meeting in Leeuwfontein was about but
that it probably concerned the incorporation issue.
   George said that in the ``unprovoked attack,'' four officers were
trapped in a police vehicle and burned to death and five others were
killed by stones and axes. The two civilians were killed by police
gunfire when the officers tried to defend themselves, he said in a
statement.
   George said an unspecified number of arrests were made and police
were patrolling the area on foot and in helicopters.
   A spokesman for the Transvaal Rural Action Committee quoted a
community leader, Dadelik Majasa, as saying police opened fire
during the meeting, killing two or three civilians, and that four or
five officers were killed when the crowd retaliated.
   Some of Leeuwfontein's 1,500 people have gone to court to contest
the incorporation on grounds it was done without prior notice. A
similar legal appeal by Braklaagte involving 9,000 rural blacks was
rejected by a regional court in March.
   Bophuthatswana is one of several tribal areas within South Africa
that the white-controlled government has encouraged to become
nominally independent, a strategy that in effect helps control the
size of the country's 28 million blacks. However, the homelands are
not recognized internationally as separate countries.
   Bophuthatswana, located in the northcentral part of the country,
has an estimated 1.7 million people.

   President Bush, back at his beloved
vacation home for an extended holiday weekend, spent a vigorous
Saturday recreating by the sea, entertaining family and encouraging
neighbors to watch his fireworks show Monday night.
   ``Beautiful day,'' he called out cheerily to neighbors out
walking their dogs when he took his 6:30 a.m. jog on dirt roads near
his family compound at Walker's Point.
   The president was accompanied on the run by daughter Dorothy
LeBlond, first dog Millie, a couple of Secret Services agents and a
reporter.
   He advised the neighbors he jogged past not to miss a fireworks
display to be set off on Monday night over Walker's Point, site of
the Bush home.
   The president's five-day stay was billed as a mostly private time
for recreation, but he said he would be going over briefing
materials for the upcoming European summit.
   Bush was accompanied on the sunny holiday weekend by wife
Barbara, some of his young grandchildren, and other relatives.
   After his two-mile jog, Bush headed for the sauna and pool, and
his daily intelligence briefing on world events.
   He then took his boat Fidelity out on the sea, whizzing by the
Shawmut Hotel just as White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
finished telling reporters the president would have no other public
activities for the day.
   However, Bush later played golf at Cape Arundel Golf Course with
longtime friend Spike Heminway and club pro Ken Raynor. As they teed
off, Bush, wearing carnary yellow pants, was asked by reporters if
he was getting tired from the day's activities.
   ``What do you mean?'' he asked, laughing. ``We're just beginning
a five-day marathon.''
   Bush played 18 holes in less than two hours and credited his
improved game to a new type of putter.
   Fitzwater said there has been no resolution of the flap over who
will pay an estimated $40,000 per year that local police must spend
to accommodate the presidential visits.
   Bush has been visiting Kennebunkport since his boyhood, but new
security demands since he has become president have prompted
complaints from local authorities, and a letter from Sen. George
Mitchell, D-Maine, seeking federal financial help.
   Fitzwater said the president wants to help and ``feels very
strongly for Kennebunkport,'' but there is no legal way to spend
federal funds to help the local governments.
   ``It would take an act of Congress that would allow us to give
money for that,'' said Fitzwater, adding that he was unaware of any
special federal help provided other small towns that have served as
presidential vacation spots in past administrations.
   Meanwhile, crowds of tourists crowding the quaint,
boutique-filled center of town appeared to be oblivious to the
president's visit.
   One of the unsolved mysteries this weekend in Kennebunkport is
the identity of the mysterious benefactor paying for what promises
to be a spectacular fireworks show Monday night.
   The show will be produced by pyrotechnics specialist George
Zambelli who counts the president among his fans.
   The state fire marshall's office said the permit was issued in
Bush's name at the request of the Secret Service, but no one is
saying who will pick up the tab, estimated at $5,000.
   Fitzwater said only that it is `an anonymous donor.''

   A Soviet sailor granted temporary asylum in
the United States was arrested Saturday after he ran naked through a
coastal resort town with an American flag in one hand and a knife in
the other, police said.
   Before running through Rockaway Beach, Alexander Ptitskin, 19,
went on a rampage that included smashing church windows and
destroying church-owned equipment, said Police Officer Gordon Witt.
   ``We don't know what caused it, but it looks like he just went
bananas and started tearing things up,'' said Witt.
   Ptitskin was charged with first-degree burglary, criminal
mischief and disorderly conduct, Witt said.
   Ptitskin, the third mate of the Soviet fishing boat The
Izmurudnyi, jumped overboard in Portland on Wednesday, saying he
wanted to ``try American.'' He told U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials he wanted political asylum.
   The Izmurudnyi left Portland on Friday bound for the Soviet Union.
   Around 5 a.m. Saturday, Rockaway Beach residents called
authorities about a disturbance near St. Mary's By the Sea Roman
Catholic Church, Witt said. A man threw a videocassette recorder, a
computer and other electronic equipment belonging to the church
through the window of a church-owned cottage. The man then ran next
door to the church's recreation hall and broke two large windows.
   With an American flag draped over his shoulder and a large knife
in the other hand, the man then went down the street to a motel and
broke a large window near the office. Ptitskin was arrested in the
lobby.
   Ptitskin arrived in Rockaway Beach, a town of about 1,280 people
about 60 miles west of Portland, on Friday evening and was staying
at a small church-owned cottage, said the church's pastor, the Rev.
Morton Park.
   ``We went to dinner and talked about several things,'' Park said.
``He had no money and no luggage and he was in a strange place. I
think he was under a lot of strees and that showed. I didn't expect
this to happen, though.''
   Ptitskin was being held in the Tillamook County jail, where bail
was set at $26,900. He was to appear in court Monday.

   John Tyler Brister, a filmmaker and arts
educator whose animated movies won awards at the Cannes Film
Festival, has died at the age of 38.
   Brister died Wednesday of complications of AIDS, his family said.
   One of his first films, ``Spanish Peanuts,'' is a stop-action
animated film in which a chorus line of peanuts dances across a
stage to a Latin rhythm. It has been shown on NBC's ``Saturday Night
Live'' and HBO and won the Silver Cup Award at the Cannes
International Film Festival in France.
   His ``Mandarin Oranges'' was distributed by the National
Endowment for the Arts Short Film Showcase program. It won an award
at the International Tournee of Animation and received a silver
medallion at the Chicago Film Festival and a gold medallion at the
Miami Film Festival.
   His latest work, ``Punch Film,'' won first prize at the Houston
Film Festival.
   Brister created many other short live-action films, commercials
and multimedia presentations.
   In Salina, Kan., he produced the 360-foot-long ``Buffalo
Crossing'' using the zoetrope style of animation. When viewed from a
moving car, a sequence of 72 life-size drawings merged into one
image of a buffalo galloping alongside the road.
   Brister, a native of Dover, Ohio, graduated with honors from the
Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1973. He was an
artist-in-residence at schools throughout the country and taught
filmmaking and animation techniques.
   Survivors include his mother, Ruth Brister of Bloomington, and a
sister.
   No services will be held.

<TEXT>
   Sudan's new military leader on Saturday
pledged to end the 6-year-old civil war peacefully, promising to
make contacts with rebels fighting the Moslem-dominated government.
Twenty-eight army generals were fired.
   ``Our primary goal is peace, and we (the army) are the people
mostly suffering from war,'' Brig. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir
told a government meeting broadcast on official radio. ``I will
enlist the help of all experts in the quest for peace.''
   El-Bashir said the peace overtures begun last month by Prime
Minister Sadek el-Mahdi, whom he toppled Friday, were ``political
machinations and not serious.''
   The war with the mainly Christian and animist rebels in the south
has crippled the economy and led to widespread famine that has
claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.
   El-Bashir led 15 military officers in the bloodless coup, the
fourth military takeover in Sudan's 33 years of independence. The
junta, known as the National Salvation Council, imposed a state of
emergency, suspended the constitution and dissolved Parliament,
political parties and unions.
   Hundreds of troops guarded the streets on Saturday, stopping and
searching cars and manning barricades. Tanks and armored cars
guarded the presidential palace, army headquarters and bridges
spanning the White Nile and Blue Nile that bisect the city.
   Telex and telephone communications with Khartoum, cut immediately
after the coup, were restored. However, reporters wanting to send
stories by telex were ordered to submit their copy for
``verification'' by officials.
   The new regime also imposed an indefinite ban on traveling
abroad. The move was believed aimed at curbing the spending of badly
needed hard currency.
   Khartoum Airport reopened for eight hours Saturday for planes
carrying Moslem pilgrims to Saudi Arabia for the annual pilgrimage,
but it was closed to other international traffic.
   Egypt on Saturday became the first country to recognize the new
regime. Relations were strained during most of el-Mahdi's three
years in power. El-Mahdi had accused Egypt of meddling in Sudan's
internal affairs by giving shelter to Gaafar Nimeiri, the president
ousted in 1985, and approving Nimeiri's political activities in
Cairo.
   In neighboring Chad, the official radio on Saturday welcomed the
military coup, saying it was for the ``greatest good of Sudan and
the Sudanese people.''
   El-Bashir, 44, consolidated his power on Saturday by sacking 28
army generals, including Gen. Fat'hi Ahmed Ali, the commander in
chief, and Gen. Babu Nimir, the chief of staff and a reputed
el-Mahdi supporter.
   The junta promoted el-Bashir from brigidier to lieutenant
general. He earlier named himself prime minister, defense minister
and armed forces commander.
   Sources close to the junta said the army detained dozens of
political figures after the coup, but there were conflicting reports
about el-Mahdi's whereabouts. Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported Saturday that el-Mahdi was in custody.
   The sources did not verify that report but said the army is
holding Hassan al-Turabi, head of the fundamentalist National
Islamic Front; Idris al-Banna, a member of the disbanded State
Council; and Mohammed Ibrahim Nugud, secretary general of the
Communist Party.
   At the meeting, el-Bashir put government undersecretaries in
charge of ministries pending appointment of a new Cabinet.
   He said he would scrap the peace process begun by el-Mahdi and
launch his own peace strategy, but he gave no details.
   In May, el-Mahdi opened peace talks with representatives of the
Sudan People's Liberation Army, led by former army Col. John Garang,
the leader of the anti-government rebellion. The rebels demand more
autonomy from the mainly Moslem, northerner-controlled government.
   One rebel demand was the permanent removal of harsh Islamic laws
introduced by Nimeiri and suspended by Mahdi earlier this year.
   Talks were to have been resumed Tuesday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
but the junta on Saturday indefinitely banned all official missions
abroad.
   The talks were based on a tentative peace accord concluded in
November and later endorsed by el-Mahdi under pressure from the army
and the unions.
   Rebel leaders have not commented on el-Bashir's coup.
   Also Saturday, the junta released more than two dozen officers
whom el-Mahdi's government arrested two weeks ago and accused of
plotting a coup.
   El-Mahdi's civilian government took power in 1986, replacing a
transitional military government that had been in place since the
1985 coup that ousted Nimeiri.
   Nimeiri last month said he would return from exile in Cairo and
regain power. El-Bashir said in a statement on Friday that his coup
had nothing to do with Nimeiri.

   A bus filled with workers ran off a
road and rolled down a 900-foot embankment in Natal province
Saturday afternoon, killing about 50 passengers and injuring 30,
police said.
   The bus was returning black laborers and domestic workers to the
independent black homeland of Transkei for the weekend when the
accident occurred near Port Shepstone, 60 miles southwest of the
coastal city of Durban.
   About 25 of the injured were in serious condition, indicating the
death toll could rise further, police said.
   South African Broadcasting Corp. quoted Lew Corbet, traffic chief
at Shepstone, as saying the bus left the road, overturned, and
plunged down the embankment.
   The region experienced heavy rain during the day, but it was not
immediately known if weather was a factor in the crash.
   Buses carrying workers frequently are overloaded and not well
maintained.
   The reports said rescuers used four-wheel-drive vehicles to bring
the dead and injured from the bottom of the ravine to the roadway.
The injured were taken to hospitals in Harding, 11 miles away, with
some serious cases taken to Durban.
   It was the second multiple-fatal bus accident in two days. On
Friday, eight people were killed and 53 hurt when a bus ran off a
road and overturned near the Numbi gate entrance of the Kruger
National Park, a wildlife reserve. All of those passengers were
local residents, police said.

   Assailants burst into a home
northwest of the capital and opened fire, killing a policeman and
wounding his elderly mother, police said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on the
outskirts of Garvagh, 40 miles northwest of Belfast. Suspicion fell
on the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which has targeted the
security forces in its guerrilla campaign to drive the British out
of Northern Ireland.
   The 57-year-old constable, whose identity was not released, was
to retire this month after 34 years in the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, the British province's police force, said a spokesman
on condition of anonymity.
   The constable had been carrying out courthouse duties, mostly in
Belfast, the spokesman said.
   He was visiting his 80-year-old mother at her home when several
armed men entered through the rear door and opened fire, the
spokesman said.
   The woman suffered a gunshot wound in the stomach and was
hospitalized ``in deep shock,'' he said.
   More than 2,700 people have been killed in 20 years of political
and sectarian violence in the province, where Protestants outnumber
Roman Catholics by a 3-to-2 margin.
   The IRA wants to unite the province with the Irish Republic,
which is predominantly Catholic, under a leftist administration.

   Conservative and communist parties ended a
two-week political deadlock Saturday and agreed to form a coalition
government. It was the first time communists have played a role in
determining the formation of Greece's government.
   It appeared, however, that the coalition would govern only three
months and that its sole task would be to clean up Greece's
scandal-ridden political system.
   The decision by the communist-dominated Coalition of the Left and
Progress to join with the conservative New Democracy Party gave that
party's premier-designate, Tzannis Tzannetakis, the support needed
for a majority in the 300-member parliament.
   President Christos Sartzetakis announced that Tzannetakis, a New
Democracy parliamentarian since 1977, would be sworn in Sunday.
   In the June 18 general election, New Democracy won 145 seats. The
Coalition _ an alliance of the Greek Communist Party, disenchanted
socialists and the Eurocommunist Greek Left _ won 28 places.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or
PASOK, lost after eight years in power, taking only 125 seats.
   Late Saturday night, the 62-year-old Tzannetakis announced the
first of his Cabinet posts. Only two of those he appointed _ the
justice and interior ministers _ were non-parliamentarians
affiliated with the leftist Coalition. Most others were from the New
Democracy Party.
   Named as deputy foreign minister was George Papoulias, currently
the envoy in Washington.
   In negotiations leading up to the agreement, New Democracy leader
Constantine Mitsotakis had offered the Coalition the Justice and
Interior ministries.
   The agreement came 40 years after the communists, in their bid to
seize power, were defeated in a civil war by U.S.-backed government
troops.
   Papandreou, 70, who was in a hospital for treatment of a heart
and kidney condition, reacted bitterly to the pact between the two
political forces.
   ``This alliance is without principles. It violates the popular
will,'' he said.
   Papandreou had called on the Coalition to join PASOK so the two
parties could set up a government. But Coalition leader Harilaos
Florakis said he didn't want to be associated with a scandal-tainted
group like the Socialists.
   A multimillion-dollar scandal allegedly involving key ministers
in Papandreou's government, and his open affair with a woman half
his age while he was married, contributed to Papandreou's downfall.
   Mitsotakis and Florakis agreed that their coalition would have a
three-month life span and that its work would be limited to
restoring democratic institutions and cleaning up Greek politics.
   Florakis said at the end of the three months, ``we will
re-examine our position and act accordingly.''
   But because of the wide gap in the two sides' political
ideologies, it appeared unlikely the coalition could survive after
its task of purging former PASOK ministers and officials accused of
involvement in scandals.
   If the coalition falls apart, the president will appoint a
caretaker regime to lead the country to natonal elections.
   A newly elected government is needed to deal with pressing
economic problems and complete negotiations with the United States
over the future of its four major military bases in Greece. The
defense pact expired last December but a clause gives the United
States 17 months to either close down the bases or renegotiate a new
agreement.
   The two members of the new coalition differ over the presence of
the U.S. bases. The Coalition has strongly opposed the four bases
and called for their removal. But the New Democracy Party favors
negotiating a new agreement.

<HEAD>Report: Technician Accidentally Erased Exxon Oil Spill Tapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Exxon computer operator said he
accidentally erased computer copies of thousands of documents on the
Alaskan oil spill, according to The New York Times.
   An Exxon spokesman confirmed the destruction, but said company
lawyers believe other copies exist either on paper or in other
computer files, the newspaper said in Sunday editions.
   Computer operator Kenneth A. Davis, who worked at Exxon's Houston
office, told the Times it would be difficult and possibly impossible
to determine which documents were destroyed.
   Davis, 33, was fired June 8, the day after the destruction was
detected. He told the Times his superiors had been negligent in
safeguarding the records, and said he contacted the newspaper
because ``they are making me the scapegoat.''
   However, Davis said, ``I have no reason to believe that anyone at
Exxon wanted these records to be destroyed.''
   Exxon has been under a federal court order to preserve the
computer records and all other material concerning the March 24
shipwreck, oil spill and cleanup in Prince William Sound. At nearly
11 million gallons, it was the nation's worst oil spill.
   Exxon spokesman Les Rogers said the company instructed employees
to preserve documents, even before the court order, though no checks
had been made to see if employees complied.
   Rogers said no search had been conducted to determine which files
were destroyed. ``When a court determines what documents are needed
and appropriate, they will be produced,'' he said.
   The material destroyed included all internal communications from
the Exxon Shipping Co., owner of the tanker Exxon Valdez, and Exxon
USA's executive offices, the Times said.
   As is their routine, Davis and other technicians spent three
nights reusing month-old computer tapes, not realizing they were
Valdez-related, he said. Davis said the tapes ``were not dated or
marked `do not destroy' as they should have been,'' and should have
been stored elsewhere.
   Stephen D. Sussman, a lawyer representing fishermen, Alaska
natives and others in a lawsuit against Exxon, said the incident
means Exxon may have been negligent ``even in the handling of its
own documents.''
   Alaska Attorney General Douglas Bailey said that ``if these
records have disappeared, it will be a substantial loss to any
effort to reconstruct what actually happened.''

   Israeli troops shot and wounded 24 Palestinians
Saturday, Arab reports said, including at least six mourners at the
home of an Arab radical who kidnapped an American relief worker and
was later killed by troops.
   The army confirmed six of the wounded and said it was
investigating the other incidents.
   Also Saturday, Israel television reported that Israeli embassies
have been ordered to refuse to accept information from the United
States and other nations concerning their talks with the PLO.
   The television quoted Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of the
left-leaning Labor Party as saying the order was an ``attempt to
escape reality.''
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, merchants shuttered their stores and
public transportation ground to a halt for the second consecutive
day as Palestinians observed a commercial strike to protest Israel's
deportation of eight Arabs.
   In the strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, Arab reports said, troops
opened fire on a group of mourners visiting the family of Mohammed
abu al-Nasr, a Palestinian who kidnapped American relief worker
Chris George last week.
   George was released unharmed after almost 30 hours of captivity.
The army said al-Nasr was gunned down last Wednesday by troops after
he hijacked an Arab taxi.
   Arab reports said troops on Saturday shot tear gas and later live
ammunition after dozens of mourners standing outside al-Nasr's home
began throwing stones at soldiers.
   The reports said at least six Palestinians were wounded in the
incident, including al-Nasr's 60-year-old uncle, Hassan abu al-Nasr.
   Arab hospital officials said three other Palestinians from
Jabaliya were wounded Saturday, but could not say whether the
additional wounded were connected to the incident at al-Nasr's home.
   Elsewhere in Gaza, seven Palestinians including a 12-year-old boy
and a 55-year-old woman were wounded by army gunfire, hospital
officials said.
   The army confirmed one wounded and said it was investigating the
other incidents.
   In the West Bank, troops shot and wounded eight Palestinians in
various clashes, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed a
total of five wounded.
   At least 538 Palestinians have been killed and 12,000 wounded
since the Arab uprising against Israeli rule began in December 1987.
Twenty-three Israelis have also been killed.
   Leaders of the center-left Labor Party said they will demand that
Sunday's regular Cabinet session address the Foreign Ministry's
reported order to its embassies to refuse information from the
United States or other countries on their talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Army radio said Foreign Minister Director-General Reuven Merhav
sent the order Israeli embassies Friday. A Foreign Ministry official
refused to confirm or deny the reports but said embassies have
standing orders not to receive such information.
   Last April, Israel turned down an offer from France to share
infomation on PLO chief Yasser Arafat's meeting with French
President Francois Mitterrand.
   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization and has refused
all contact with its members.
   In another development Saturday, Israeli Arabs said the Police
Ministry has stopped recruiting them out of fear they might be too
sympathetic to Palestinian protesters in the occupied territories.
   Police Chief David Krauss told the Maariv newspaper Friday that
the Palestinian uprising had ``penetrated deeply from the (occupied)
territories to the Arab residents of the state of Israel.''
   Israel has about 750,000 Arabs living within its borders.
   Police spokesman Rafi Levy denied that Arabs were being cut out
of the recruitment because of fears of divided loyalties.
   ``The issue is simply that we are full,'' Levy said. ``If there
is an opening it could go to an Arab or a Jew. There will be no
discrimination.''
   Also Saturday, a Jordanian newspaper said Israel is limiting to
2,500 the number of Palestinians allowed to cross daily from Jordan
to the West Bank. The Arabic-language daily Al-Rai said the decision
will take effect Tuesday.
   In previous years, as many as 4,000 Arabs a day were allowed to
cross over the Jordan River, according to Col. Abdul-Hafith Uteish,
a deputy bridge director quoted by Al-Rai.
   The travelers are Palestinians who visit relatives in the
occupied areas.

   Chinese students burned a Communist flag before their homeland's
consulate in Los Angeles, and 5,000 people rallied in San Francisco
on the 68th anniversary Saturday of the Chinese Communist Party's
founding.
   Chinese students and scholars demonstrated in front of the
consulate in Chicago, denouncing Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese
leaders as murderers. At Indiana University in Bloomington, four
Chinese students renounced their membership in the party.
   The rallies were part of a nationwide ``Democracy Day,'' during
which participants urged an end to the crackdown on pro-democracy
activists in China that followed the army attack June 3-4 on
protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   In Los Angeles, about 50 Chinese, mostly university students from
Santa Barbara, attended the noon flag burning at the consulate near
downtown.
   ``Down with the Communist party! Down with the murderous party!
Down with the old men's party! Rebuild a new China!'' the students
shouted.
   They stuffed the red and gold Chinese Communist Party flag into a
concrete waste can filled with burning copies of the People's Daily
News, the official Chinese Communist newspaper.
   They later distributed to the news media copies of a letter to be
delivered to consul officials, expressing outrage over ``brutal
suppression of human rights'' in their homeland and asking Chinese
officials to declare pardons and amnesty for pro-democracy students.
   The letter also included a list of Chinese dissidents and asked
the government for an account of their safety and whereabouts.
   Most students did not want to be quoted by name, saying they
feared retribution by their government.
   ``These students are taking a risk by doing this publicly,'' said
University of California at Santa Barbara professor Walter Yuen, a
member of the International Citizenry for a Democratic China, which
organized the event.
   ``They are probably losing their chances to ever go back to China
and could be putting their relatives still in China at risk,'' he
said.
   In San Francisco, an 8-foot replica of the ``Goddess of Liberty''
statue erected during the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen
Square was unveiled in Justin Herman Plaza, where politicians
addressed an overflow crowd.
   The gypsum cement statue was built by Chinese students at the
Academy of Art College, and is a model of a bronze one that
community groups want to erect in San Francisco's Chinatown as a
permanent reminder of the students who died when authorities used
troops to quell the protests.
   In Indiana, the students resigned from the Communist Party to
protest the attack and the crackdown.
   ``We cannot do many things to protest. This is one thing we can
do,'' said Pan Youfang, 39, a graduate student in computer science
who quit after 16 years of membership.
   Many Chinese students have preferred to keep their party
membership a secret in the United States, fearing prejudice from
Americans or the U.S. government, Chinese students said.
   He Zhou, 35, a graduate student in journalism, said the party
advised Chinese students not to admit their membership when they
applied for visas to study in the United States.
   Now, he said, the students ``identify themselves as communists
only for the purpose of quitting.''
   In Chicago, about 100 Chinese students and supporters paraded
with signs and banners in front of the downtown consulate.
   ``Let our voice be heard,'' said Chun Li, a student
representative at Northwestern University in suburban Evanston.
``The people did not shed their blood in vain. A new page in Chinese
history is now being turned.''

<HEAD>Opposition Claims Voter Registration Irregularities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders filed complaints
alleging fraud and a civic group pledged to monitor polling stations
in Baja California, where voters elect a new governor Sunday.
Elections also were scheduled in four other states.
   The gubernatorial, legislative and mayoral elections are viewed
as a test of whether the goverment intends to keep the political
process honest.
   The opposition planned to have pollwatchers at all 1,666 polling
stations in Baja California when the border state's 900,000
registered voters vote Sunday, Javier Rivera of the conservative
National Action Party said Saturday.
   In the other voting Sunday, state legislators will be chosen in
Zacatecas, Michoacan, Campeche and Chihuahua. Mayoral elections are
scheduled in Chihuahua. Official results are expected in about a
week.
   In Baja California, the latest polls show a close finish between
Ernesto Ruffo of the National Action Party, or PAN, and Margarita
Ortega of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. A
poll published Friday in the Mexico City daily La Jornada showed
Ruffo at 33.7 percent and Ms. Ortega with 32.7 percent.
   Two leftist candidates stand virtually no chance of victory.
   If Ruffo _ a former mayor of Ensenada _ wins, the election would
be the first gubernatorial race the Institutional Revolutionary
Party lost in its 60-year history.
   Juan Manuel Salazar, president of the Action Party's municipal
committee in Tijuana, said Saturday he filed a complaint with the
state election commission alleging that election officials were
preparing to allow multiple voting with forged documents.
   Last week, the electoral commission burned 24,000 voting
credentials, claiming many of them were falsified. Some people even
use the registrations of deceased voters when they cast ballots.
   ``We can see if they are alive or dead. If they don't come, they
probably don't exist,'' said Antonio Rodriguez of the local
electoral commission.
   Opposition officials say their members mysteriously disappear
from the voting lists and are therefore unable to cast ballots.
   Hundreds of people waited all night Friday outside one election
office to obtain their registration cards. Jorge Amaral Munoz said
the wait was worth it.
   ``I'm worried about the political situation in this country,'' he
said. ``What's most important is that we decide through popular
vote. Who wins must do so honestly.''
   Salvador Morales Munoz, president of the Action Party campaign
committee in Tijuana, said 8,000 people still were not registered by
Saturday.
   But Rodriguez of the electoral commission said: ``We'll work up
until the last minute so people can vote.''
   Luis Alvarez, president of the National Action Party, said
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has promised an investigation
into opposition charges that voter registration lists were padded in
Baja California and Chihuahua.
   Salinas, who took office in December, has vowed to clean up
Mexico's politics.
   ``I have stated that I will uphold the law and that I will
certainly practice it,'' Salinas said recently.
   The president recently announced expensive public works projects
for Baja California, where little more than one-third the voters
cast their ballots for him in last year's presidential balloting.

<HEAD>Early Airmail Flier Dead At 99</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alva Sole, a U.S. Airmail Service pioneer
who delivered mail to Franklin D. Roosevelt and was a friend of
World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker, died at age 99.
   Sole died in his sleep Thursday.
   In air mail's infancy, Sole would swoop down, aim his
canvas-covered biplane at two posts on the ground, fly between them
and snatch a mail pouch from a wire stretched overhead before
climbing back into the air.
   Highlights of Sole's career included flying mail to Roosevelt at
Warm Springs, Ga., and taking Roosevelt's son, Elliott, on plane
rides. He flew planes with Will Rogers.
   His friends included Rickenbacker, America's top World War I ace
and Eastern Airlines' founder, Jimmy Doolittle, the World War II
flier who led a daring surprise attack on Tokyo in April 1942, and
war correspondent Ernie Pyle.
   Sole was born in Wheeling, W.Va., in 1889 and as a teen-ager went
to work shoveling coal on a train. He landed a job as a mail clerk
on a train and worked his way up to become head of the postal
service's Atlanta office in 1933.
   In the meantime, he obtained his pilot's license, and volunteered
for some of the first airmail flights in the late 1920s and early
1930s. Many of the pilots died, getting lost in fog until their fuel
ran out or crashing into mountains.
   Their most dangerous maneuver was the pickup, when they would
swing down between the posts.

   Tony Aliengena, an 11-year-old Californian flying a
single-engine plane around the world, left Saturday for the next
stop on his journey across the Soviet Union, the Tass news agency
said.
   The fourth-grader, flying a blue and white Cessna 210, took off
from Moscow's Sheremetevo airport for Kuibyshev, 450 miles
southeast, the next stop on his hopscotch journey across the Soviet
Union en route to Alaska.
   Tony, who arrived in Moscow on Monday, spent five days touring
the capital and passed through Red Square, where West German
teenager Mathias Rust landed a single-engine Cessna in May 1987
after evading Soviet air defenses.
   He had hoped to meet with Mikhail S. Gorbachev but was told by
Kremlin officials the president was too busy. He carried to Moscow a
``friendship scroll'' with the signatures of 250,000 American
children.
   He has another ``friendship scroll'' he hopes 100,000 young
people will sign during his stops in Soviet cities and he plans to
present it to President Bush.
   Tony, from San Juan Capistrano, began his global flight June 5 in
California. His flight plan will take him 19,000 miles around the
world in short hops averaging three hours each.
   While flying in the Soviet Union, Tony will be accompanied by a
Soviet navigator because air controllers on many Soviet domestic
routes do not speak English.
   The young Californian's entourage includes a second twin-engine
plane for a U.S. documentary film crew, a publicity agent, a
10-year-old Soviet pen pal, and Soviet and American journalists.

<HEAD>East Germany Denies Western Loans Diverted To Libya, Terrorist Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist East Germany on Saturday denied
allegations it diverted to Libya millions of dollars in Western bank
loans and that much of the money wound up in the hands of terrorists.
   The state-run ADN news agency, in a one-sentence dispatch, said
the allegations ``do not correspond to the facts.'' ADN said the
statement came from ``the responsible (East German) agency.'' It did
not elaborate.
   A former member of the U.S. National Security Council, Norman A.
Bailey, said a $600 million loan to East Germany ended up in Libya
and that $60 million was given to terrorist groups in Libya,
Northern Ireland, Colombia and West Germany.
   Bailey, a senior director of national security planning from 1981
to 1983, said the loan was arranged by U.S. and other Western banks
in 1985.
   He said the money was traced by the highly secret National
Security Agency, which eavesdrops on international communications
for U.S. intelligence operations.
   Bailey said the deal was closed in London and that the money was
first transferred to East Berlin. He said it was then dispersed to
various front companies and later collected in Libya, where it was
given to terrorist groups.
   Bailey charged some of the money was distributed to terrorists
connected to the April 5, 1986 bombing of a West Berlin discotheque
killed a U.S. sergeant and a Turkish woman and wounded 204 people.
   The official Libyan news agency, JANA, has denied the story.
   White House spokesman Roman Papadiuk said he had no information
to substantiate Bailey's statement.
   Tom Lindeman, a spokesman for the First National Bank of Chicago,
said a $600 million loan to East Germany was organized in 1985 with
the International Bank of Japan.
   About 50 banks from different countries were involved, he said.
   Alan Delp, the Chicago bank's senior vice president in charge of
international banking, said he would be very surprised if the money
went to Libya.

<HEAD>Salvaged Cargo Plane Rises From The Ice</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A huge cargo plane
that arose from the Antarctic ice like a frozen phoenix after being
buried in drifts for 16 years returned to its home base Saturday.
   ``Today we are celebrating a triumph: a triumph of technology, a
triumph of knowledge and skill, and a triumph of courage,'' National
Science Foundation spokesman Jack Talmadge said after the LC-130
Hercules and its nine-member crew landed.
   Lockheed engineers and Navy personnel worked in subfreezing cold,
heavy snow and windstorms for 42 days to excavate the icebound,
40-ton aircraft. The 98-foot-long plane was flown out of the crash
site in January 1988 and was renovated in Christchurch, New Zealand.
   The LC-130 returned to its hangar at the Navy's Antarctic
Development Squadron 6, the ``Puckered Penguins'' who fly seven
cargo ships owned by the foundation and used to supply its polar
missions.
   The Hercules was abandoned in December 1971 at a remote site
about 700 miles from McMurdo Sound, the U.S. ice station on the
Antarctic, after an aborted takeoff that damaged its landing ski and
nose.
   The aircraft was designed for use in polar climates and has
one-ton, Teflon-coated ``wheel-skis'' to break the grip of ice on
takeoff.
   The loss of the Hercules hurt the foundation's ability to conduct
field research in Antarctica, foundation officials have said.
   A salvage crew worked in minus 30-degree temperatures, heavy snow
and 20-knot windstorms to excavate the damaged aircraft, repair it
and fly it out. All but the top 3 feet of the plane's 38-foot-high
tail had been buried in snow.
   The plane was made by Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. in
Marietta, Ga. Lockheed engineers involved in the salvage found many
hydraulic and electronics systems still working after the long
hibernation.
   There was still air in the tires and gasoline in the tanks,
apparently preserved by the frigid temperatures and dry polar
climate.
   Foundation officials say about $4.2 million was spent to excavate
and overhaul the plane. The estimated cost of a replacement plane is
$35 million.

   At least three of the four people killed in the
worst Atlanta fire in nine years would probably have lived if
sprinklers had been required in the 27-year-old office building, the
city's top fire official said Saturday.
   ``In this instance, I guarantee you there wouldn't have been four
deaths if sprinklers had been in there,'' said Acting Fire Chief Tom
Perrin.
   The 10-story Peachtree 25th building, which housed 1,200 office
workers including those from six federal agencies, was built in 1962
_ 12 years before city codes required sprinkler systems in new
buildings taller than eight stories, Perrin said.
   No laws were passed to force the owners of older buildings to
install the sprinklers, he said.
   Building owners ``say it costs too much, but how much are these
four lives going to cost?'' Perrin said. ``You know there are going
to be lawsuits filed in a fire like this.''
   A series of powerful electrical explosions apparently set off
when an electrical worker was changing a fuse triggered the blaze at
10:30 a.m. Friday. Much of the building was evacuated quickly, but a
number of workers were trapped and broke out windows to escape
choking plumes of smoke.
   They were rescued by firefighters using ladders, but one woman,
20-year-old Cassandra Hayward, leaped from a sixth-floor window to
escape the fire. She suffered broken legs, a broken ankle and hand
injuries and was in critical but stable condition Saturday at
Piedmont Hospital. Seven others remained hospitalized Saturday, one
in critical condition.
   Sgt. Steve Martin with the Fulton County medical examiner's
office identified two of the dead as Clifton C. Chandler, 29, of
Decatur, a graphic artist with an office in the building; and Victor
Tinubu, 36, of Atlanta. Martin said Tinubu's reason for being in the
building was not immediately known.
   Sgt. Richard Eskew of the medical examiner's office said
autopsies revealed all four victims died of smoke inhalation, with
the electrician also suffering severe burns.
   Investigators were puzzled about the identity of the woman. Eskew
said no one had even telephoned authorities with a missing person
report and she apparently did not work in the building.
   It was the worst Atlanta fire since 1980, when five people
including four children were killed in an explosion at a day-care
center.
   Although thick smoke rather than flames was likely to blame for
the deaths in Friday's fire, Perrin said a sprinkler system would
have ``certainly'' saved three people whose bodies were found some
distance from the initial blast.
   Even the workman who was fatally injured by the explosion was
able to stagger or crawl down a hall, away from the fire, and might
have lived had a sprinkler system put out the blaze, he said.
   ``It might have even saved that fourth guy,'' Perrin said. ``I
feel like we probably wouldn't have had any deaths if we'd had the
sprinkler system.''
   Fire officials were focusing their investigation Saturday on
whether extensive electrical work being done in the building played
a role in the fire and whether some of that work violated city codes.
   Perrin said an electrical contractor received a city permit in
May to renovate the first floor, but fire investigators found
evidence of large-scale work on the sixth and other floors.
   ``There were ladders in there, and they had heavy conduit pulled
out,'' he said. Such work, without a permit, would be a violation,
he said.
   The building is managed by American Management Co. of the Los
Angeles suburb of Torrance. Harry Komsky, vice president of the
company, said an investigation would begin into the fire, but he
would not comment on the lack of sprinklers.
   Komsky said the company is ``shocked beyond words at the loss of
life and the injuries.''
   Six federal agencies have offices in the building, located north
of midtown Atlanta, including the Department of Agriculture,
Department of the Treasury, Department of Health and Human Services
and the National Transportation Safety Board.
   None of those offices is on the sixth floor, where the damage was
the worst and where the people were trapped, Perrin said.
   Perrin said he hoped the fire would result in legislation
requiring sprinkler systems in all buildings beyond a certain
height, regardless of their ages. He said he planned to send
information about the blaze to congressmen interested in fire safety
issues.
   There were reports by some agencies Friday that a fifth person
had died in the fire, but Martin said that stemmed from confusion
over the unrelated death of a construction worker who fell from a
construction site a few miles away, at about the same time as the
fire.

   Undercover police officers posing as
drug dealers arrested more than 1,700 people in a weekend crackdown
on crack from the Florida Panhandle to the Keys, officials said
Saturday.
   Officers at times made nearly 100 arrests an hour, and it was
expected the total could top 2,000 before the 48-hour operation
concluded after midnight Saturday, Broward County sheriff's
spokesman George Crolius said at the command center here.
   Nearly 1,000 officers in 61 of the state's 67 counties
participated in ``Operation Rock Pile,'' which was organized by the
Florida Sheriffs Association.
   ``From now on, it's going to be war,'' said Broward Sheriff Nick
Navarro.
   By 10 p.m., the crackdown had netted 2,981 pieces of crack,
nearly 10 pounds of cocaine and three pounds of other drugs,
including heroin and steroids, Crolius said.
   Authorities also seized more than $44,300, 291 cars, a boat and
44 firearms, he said.
   About a third of the arrests were in the south Florida area from
Key West to Fort Pierce, including Miami and Fort Lauderdale, said
Crolius.
   But authorities were surprised by the more than 320 arrests
Friday and Saturday in the rural western Panhandle.
   ``We thought that most of the action would be in the cities,''
said Crolius. ``We didn't think we'd see that type of crack activity
in the Panhandle.''
   The effort targeted street-level crack users and dealers, the
spokesman said.
   ``We want to send the message down to the streets that we are
getting serious about crack,'' he said. ``We want to put the fear in
the users that at any time they could be buying from a cop.''
   Crack, a form of cocaine, is also known as rock.

   A 45-year-old woman who died after
undergoing a session in a beauty salon tanning booth in order to
treat a skin condition was not warned it could lead to dangerous
complications, her husband has charged in a complaint.
   The ultraviolet treatment _ which was prescribed in tandem with a
drug _ should have been done in a doctor's office or under tighter
controls, the husband's lawyer, Saul I. Ruman, said Saturday.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted an inquiry into
the death May 24 of Patsy J. Campbell, but the agency did not
recommend action against any individual or business, Clarence
Danielson, investigator at the FDA's Indianapolis office, said
Friday.
   Dr. Carolyn T. Beyer of Chesterton prescribed Oxsoralen-Ultra for
Mrs. Campbell for treatment of psoriasis,according to a complaint
filed Thursday with the state Department of Insurance.
   Mrs. Campbell, of Portage, took the drug two hours before
receiving the ultraviolet treatment as prescribed by Beyer,
according to the lawsuit brought by her husband, Julius.
   After a 25-minute session May 13 at Brenda's Hair Loft in
Portage, Mrs. Campbell suffered extensive burns and subsequent
infection. She died 11 days later at a hospital in Chicago.
   ``Tanning is ordinarily done in a doctor's office with meters
which precisely measure the amount'' of exposure, said Ruman.
   ``She shouldn't have been sent out without the tightest of
controls, or specific written directions,'' Ruman said.
   Beyer does not have a listed home number and no one immediately
responded to a message left Saturday on her office answering maching.
   Under Indiana law governing medical malpractice lawsuits, the
case will be reviewed by a panel of three doctors who will rule
whether there was malpractice.
   If the panel decides there was malpractice, the plaintiff and
defendant can negotiate a settlement and the plaintiff can also seek
compensation from the state Patient Compensation Fund. The maximum
from the doctor and the fund is $500,000, insurance department
officials said.
   If the panel rules there wasn't malpractice, the plaintiff can
pursue the case in the civil courts.

<TEXT>
   Demonstrators burned
tires and barricaded streets Saturday during the funeral of a man
who allegedly killed himself shortly before he was to be extradited
to the United States.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse the protest in his hometown of
Cotui, 70 miles north of the capital. Two people were injured and 20
people were arrested, authorities said.
   Police said Daniel Mirambeaux, 42, jumped to his death Thursday
from the third floor of police headquarters shortly after being told
he would be extradited to New York City to face charges he killed a
police officer.
   President Joaquin Balaguer on Saturday fired Police Chief Maj.
Gen. Nelson Morillo Rodriguez, who was reportedly with Mirambeaux
minutes before his death. No reason was given for the firing.
   Police said Friday that Mirambeaux escaped from two guards who
were escorting him from the police chief's office to the airport and
jumped through a large hole in the wall near a third-floor staircase.
   Mirambeaux was buried in Cotui while youths burned tires and
blocked streets with stones and tree trunks.
   A youth was injured by fragments of a tear gas canister shot by
police to disperse the demonstrators, and one policeman was injured
when a protester pelted him in the face, police said.
   Mirambeaux's relatives blamed police for his death and said they
doubted he committed suicide. On several occasions Mirambeux said he
would rather die than return to the United States to face trial in
the Oct. 18 shooting death of New York policeman Michael Buczek
during a drug raid in Manhattan.
   Mirambeaux, who arrived in the Dominican Republic the day after
Buczek's death, was jailed in November for illegal possession of a
pistol.
   A special investigating commission on Saturday began
interrogating the two policemen who accompanied Mirambeaux from the
police chief's office before he allegedly bolted and jumped from the
third floor.
   The two officers have been suspended pending the investigation's
findings.

   Indians wearing feathered headdresses
danced, a peace pipe was passed and ice cream was the hot item
Saturday at the Party of the Century, marking North Dakota's 100
years of statehood.
   The opening of the four-day centennial event was marked by
speeches, a colorful Vietnamese dragon dance and the release of
hundreds of balloons into sunny skies as the crowd sang ``Happy
Birthday.''
   ``This is a great idea,'' said Marianne Nesvig, a visitor from
Menlo Park, Calif. ``It's a unifying effort. They really went all
out.''
   An estimated 15,000 people turned out, said Highway Patrol Lt.
Jim Hughes.
   During the festivities, six Indians wearing traditional clothing
and headdresses performed the dances of their ancestors, beating on
drums and chanting Indian songs.
   At one point, four Indians sitting in a circle passed a
ceremonial peace pipe nearly 3 feet long among themselves, turning
the pipe in a circle before handing it to the next person.
   With temperatures in the 90s, the ice cream booth quickly became
popular.
   ``We're busy enough,'' said ice cream booth attendant June
Miller, trying to keep up with the line of customers.
   The Folklife Festival at the Capitol and other activities
throughout the area and the state provided a way to celebrate the
people and land of North Dakota, Lt. Gov. Lloyd Omdahl told a crowd
of several hundred.
   ``We are here to properly recognize the development of a great
state from a raw and rustic territory,'' said Omdahl, who was
dressed in a top hat and tails from the 1880s.
   ``It's your centennial,'' added former Gov. Art Link, chairman of
the state Centennial Commission, which planned to spend $100,000 on
the celebration it labeled the Party of the Century.
   ``You, the people of North Dakota, have taken the challenge and
are demonstrating the commitment present 100 years ago,'' Link said.
   Organizers of the extravaganza expected up to 100,000 people
would come to Bismarck and neighboring Mandan, which together are
home to about 65,000 people, for the four-day affair.
   The Folklife Festival featured tents and booths displaying
crafts, food and music representing all facets of the state's ethnic
heritage. Sunday's festivities were to include a parade of
horse-drawn wagons from Bismarck to Mandan.
   Idaho also begins its centennial year this week, and the
year-long observance of 100 years of statehood starts with a long
list of July events.
   Gov. Cecil D. Andrus has proclaimed Monday to be Idaho Statehood
Day, urging citizens to fly the flag and take part in local
observances.

   About 80 Japanese monkeys were on the
loose Saturday after escaping from their compound at a safari park,
and some were sighted across the border in New York state, zoo
officials said.
   Officials discovered the monkeys had escaped Thursday morning,
said Danny Kyle, an owner of Parc Safari, about 56 miles southeast
of Montreal.
   ``Apparently they managed to find or create a faulty hinge on the
door'' to the compound where they were housed, Kyle said in a
telephone interview.
   Most of them on Saturday were in a large wooded area surrounding
the reserve, but 10 or 12 broke away from the group and made it over
the border to the United States.
   Some were seen by local residents and state troopers at Perrys
Mills, N.Y., a town three miles south of the park.
   The small primates, called snow monkeys, come from the mountains
of Japan and weigh between 15 and 20 pounds. The animals are
mischievous but not dangerous, said Kyle.
   Park employees formed a human chain to try to force the monkeys
back into the reserve and stop them from reaching the border about a
mile away. They also ``tried to entice them back into the compound
by means of apples, oranges and bananas'' Kyle said, but the attempt
was unsuccessful.
   ``Apparently they got lost or separated,'' said Kyle.
   ``The group includes males, females and babies,'' he said. ``They
tend to stick together in groups led by one dominant male. . .. They
were all born in captivity, so that's in our favor too, they are not
used to having to look for food themselves.''

   Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner married
Kimberley Conrad, 1988's Playmate of the Year, in an outdoor
ceremony Saturday afternoon as helicopters chattered overhead and
photographers jostled for a better shot of the Playboy mansion.
   The 30-minute, non-denominational ceremony took place in front of
the wishing well where the 63-year-old Hefner, perhaps the nation's
best-known playboy, proposed to Miss Conrad, 26.
   The wedding was heralded by the sounds of trumpets. About 200
guests, including actors Bill Cosby and Tony Curtis, were on hand
when Hefner tied the knot.
   The ceremony was conducted by Charles A. Ara, who ``brought
comedic moments'' to the proceedings, said Bjay Turner, a Playboy
publicist.
   ``The grass isn't always greener on the other side,'' Ara
counseled the groom. ``It's greener where it's watered. Hef, water
the grass.''
   The ceremony brought together top stars and culture magnates, but
those interviewed declined to give it symbolic meaning.
   Asked if the gathering marked the end of an era, Curtis said, ``I
think it's the beginning of somebody's marriage.''
   Motown records founder Barry Gordy became flustered when asked if
the sexual revolution was over. ``Ahhh, I don't know,'' he
stammered. ``I can't... I can't comment on that.''
   Hefner's brother, Keith, was the best man. Miss Conrad's sister,
Resa Miller, served as matron of honor and her father, Robert,
escorted her down a long, white carpet.
   Miss Conrad wore a full-length gown designed by Jim Hjelm, of New
York, with a drop waist and brocade bodice with a demure straight
neckline. The chapel-length train was dotted with pearls.
   Hefner chose a 1940s-style look that included a single-breasted
black wool tuxedo with black satin lapels and matching vest.
   A duplicate was made in case of an emergency, said Rick Pallack,
a haberdasher to the stars who has outfitted Pat Sajak, Tony Danza,
Wayne Gretzky and Sylvester Stallone.
   ``It's a great honor for me,'' Pallack gushed. ``I mean, the man
has worn nothing but silk pajamas for 30 years.''
   Wedding guests munched on imported cheeses and smoked fish, and
danced to a 25-piece band.
   The guests included former playmate Shannon Tweed and her rock
star husband Gene Simmons, and actors Dick Van Patten, Robert Culp
and Don Adams.
   The newlyweds plan to honeymoon at the mansion. When asked how
long, Ms. Turner said ``probably a lifetime.''
   Miss Conrad already has gotten one of her wishes, with the
mansion's comely entourage politely dispatched from the 5.3-acre
Playboy Mansion in the city's Holmby Hills section.
   ``She's made it clear that this is her home and people just can't
wander in and out now like they always have,'' Playboy spokesman
Bill Farley said several hours before the ceremony. ``They must be
cordially invited.''
   Hefner passed on holding the traditional bachelor party before
the wedding, and Farley quoted him as saying: ``Bachelor party? I've
had a bachelor party for 30 years, why do I need one now?''
   Farley said the marriage captures the spirit of the 1990s.
   ``Hugh Hefner, the perennial bachelor, is getting married at a
time a lot of his magazine readers are getting married,'' he said.
``The trend for the 1990s is commitment.''
   Hefner was married once before, for 10 years to Millie Williams,
and they had two children _ Christie, 36, and David, 34. ``I am,
most important, excited about it because he's so happy,'' said Ms.
Hefner, who is chairman of Playboy Enterprises.
   Earlier Saturday, workers wound garlands of flowers around the
mansion's grand staircase, and a huge white tent was erected
alongside the home's exotic grotto.
   The news media were not invited to the event. An advisory issued
last week detailed how pictures by former White House photographer
David Hume Kennerly and a news release would be distributed. And a
half-hour of taped highlights of the wedding was to be shown on the
cable Playboy Channel's pay-per-view service July 15.
   Hefner was tamed in part by a mild stroke in 1986. He stopped
smoking his pipe and he switched to caffeine-free Diet Pepsi, but he
still wears his trademark purple silk pajamas day and night.
   He lifted the blinds on sex when he started his Playboy empire in
1953, a decade before his bride was born, with his famous men's
magazine featuring nude pictures of women accompanied by risque text.
   The magazine now has a circulation of 3.5 million.

   Hundreds of firefighters Saturday battled forest fires in
Colorado, California and Utah that consumed nearly 10,000 acres.
Officials were concerned about the potential for further blazes as
thousands headed for parks for the Fourth of July weekend.
   More than 250 firefighters worked to contain four
lightning-sparked blazes that had charred about 1,250 acres in
bone-dry western and northern Colorado by Saturday. One building was
burned and people evacuated from more than half a dozen homes
southwest of Grand Junction when the newest forest fire erupted.
   In California, a new fire burned near the Sequoia National Forest
as experts began restoring 8,200 scorched acres south of Los Angeles.
   In Utah, a 200-acre fire in the Ashley National Forest's Rough
Canyon, 23 miles west of Duchesne, had been contained on Thursday
but burst into flames again Friday when 20 to 25 mph winds from the
southwest pushed the burning embers into fresh vegetation. Northwest
of Rough Canyon, a blaze dubbed the Three-Mile Fire had blackened
300 acres. Eighty firefighters, ferried to the remote site by two
helicopters, were on the lines.
   In Colorado, BLM spokesman Doug Huntington said the newest fire,
a 300-acre blaze in the Glade Park area about 15 miles southwest of
Grand Junction, was being battled with crews operating half a dozen
fire engines, three air tankers and helicopters.
   ``Numerous other structures, homes and barns, are threatened,''
he said.
   He said the fire was noticed about noon, and within four hours
had grown to 300 acres.
   Mesa County Sheriff's Capt. Bob Silva said all the residents of
the satellite community near Grand Junction had been contacted and
asked to evacuate. He did not know how many evacuees there were.
   The most damaging fire in Colorado consumed about 800 acres, but
was about 70 percent contained in a small canyon about 10 miles
north of Grand Junction, said U.S. Bureau of Land Management
spokeswoman Keele Keeler.
   A 275-acre blaze in the Poudre Canyon northwest of Fort Collins
was about 30 percent contained, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jeff
Chandler said.
   Chandler said the fire threatened some structures near Rustic,
but no property damage was reported.
   Firefighters believe they have the upper hand on a 175-acre blaze
along a mountain ridge north of Dinosaur that began Wednesday, said
BLM spokesman Jim Anderson.
   Authorities posted a high to extreme fire danger advisory
statewide, and urged outdoor recreationists to use caution during
the holiday weekend.
   Officials also warned against celebrating the Fourth with
fireworks.
   In California, more than 600 firefighters were on the line
against a 227-acre fire south of the Sequoia National Forest, said
state Department of Forestry spokeswoman Donna Atwood.
   ``It's in real steep, brushy terrain ... but there are no reports
of high winds, which is helpful,'' Atwood said. Along with the
firefighters, two aerial tankers and two water-dropping helicopters
worked to douse the flames.
   The national forest and its preserve of giant trees were not in
danger from the fire.
   No homes or other buildings were damaged or threatened, and there
were no reports of injuries, Atwood said. The fire was about 150
miles north of Los Angeles.
   Firefighters planned to contain the Lake Elsinore fire, which
burned 11 homes, and left more than 8,200 acres scorched, including
1,000 acres of the Cleveland National Forest.
   Nearly 2,300 firefighters were on the line earlier this week at
the height of the blaze 65 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

   More than 600 people threw rocks and
heckled three dozen white-robed Klansmen Saturday as they assembled
for a rally in a downtown park.
   Members of Frederick Citizens Against the Klan and the African
People's Socialist Party shouted anti-racist slogans at the Klan
group, who carried billy clubs and American and Confederate flags.
   The protesters booed and chanted, drowning out a speech by
Maryland KKK Grand Dragon Roger Kelly. One man held up a tape
recorder that was blaring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous
``I have a dream ...'' speech.
   Hundreds of people were on the Klansmen's heels as they left the
park. Amid shouting and pushing, the Klansmen hopped in the back of
a U-Haul truck, which was pelted with rocks as it pulled away.
   A woman in the crowd was hit with a rock. She was treated at a
local hospital and released.

   Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia
signed an agreement Saturday to cooperate on environmental
protection, the state news agency PAP reported.
   Under the agreement, the countries are to set up constant
monitoring of air pollution. A tripartite government commission will
be established to supervise implementation of the agreement, it said.
   The agreement contains ``commitments to prevent further
degradation of the natural environment, particularly in border
regions,'' the agency said.
   Prime Ministers Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski of Poland, Ladislav Adamec
of Czechoslovakia and Willi Stoph, chairman of the East German
Council of Ministers met in the southwestern city of Wroclaw for the
signing ceremony, PAP said.
   The governments are concerned about the noxious effects on the
environment of sulphur dioxide and phosphorous oxides, the agency
said.
   Rakowski was quoted as saying: ``Degradation of the environment
in southwestern Poland: water, soil and air pollution has reached a
catastrophic state. ... A real threat has surfaced of the ecological
balance being tipped and the region turning into a desert.''
   The smell of burning brown coal used for fuel hangs heavy over a
number of cities in the region including the industrial center of
Katowice, one of the most polluted cities in Poland. Even clear days
are often hazy from industrial pollution.
   Scientists at the Polish Academy of Sciences said in a January
report that 12 million Poles live in areas afflicted by a complete
breakdown of the environment. They said urgent measures were needed
to clean up the ``dirtiest country in Europe.''
   The Rakowski government has permitted the closing of a
chromium-producing factory near Wroclaw because it was an
environmental hazard.

   A man whose antiwar bomb shattered a
five-story campus building said he regrets the 1970 blast killed
someone but still feels he was right to protest the Vietnam War.
   David S. Fine, a University of Wisconsin student at the time, was
among veterans of the 1960s protest movement who gathered this
weekend for a reunion.
   He and three other men were put on the FBI's list of most-wanted
fugitives after their homemade bomb damaged a campus building,
killing a student and injuring several other people on Aug. 24,
1970. Several other people were injured.
   Fine, Karleton Armstrong and his brother, Dwight Armstrong, were
eventually arrested and received prison sentences. Leo Burt,
identified as the fourth participant, was never captured.
   The building had formerly housed the Army Mathematics Research
Center and was frequently a target of campus antiwar demonstrations.
Fine and other participants denied intending to harm anyone.
   ``Regardless of why the bombing happened and the feelings people
had about the center and the war in Vietnam, that in no way
justifies the death and destruction,'' Fine said in an interview
published Saturday.
   ``So I have a lot of regrets about that. Always have, always
will, I'm sure,'' he said.
   Weekend events included discussion groups with topics ranging
from Women in the 1990s to the Decline and Fall of Civil Rights.
   Fine, 37, who works in a law office in Portland, Ore., said he
worried about what kind of reception he would get in Madison.
   ``I'm not going to come back and attempt to justify things I was
convicted of which were very tragic,'' he said.
   ``I probably wouldn't contemplate doing something like that now
under the same circumstances,'' Karleton Armstrong said. ``But for
where I was at and where people were at the time, I thought it was
right.''
   The Madison native said he had no plans to attend the reunion but
would be on the campus selling fruit juice from a stand he has
operated for several years.
   Dwight Armtstrong is in prison in Indiana on a drug charge.
   Madison FBI agent John Frazer said Burt was dropped from the
most-wanted list years ago but remains a federal fugitive. Asked if
authorities would watch for Burt during the reunion, university
security chief Ralph Hanson said: ``I'm looking for him. I don't
expect him to show up.''

   A holiday traveler landed his small airplane
in the middle of an interstate when he ran out of gas.
   Matthew Thiele of Nashua landed his plane in the southbound lanes
of Interstate 93 near the Tilton exit, less than 20 miles north of
Concord, when he ran out of fuel shortly after 4 p.m., said state
Trooper Kevin Stevens.
   No one was injured and no accidents were caused by the impromptu
landing, Stevens said. The single-engine Champion airplane was
pushed to the side of the road so traffic could continue moving.
   Thiele took off from the interstate a little less than 2 hours
later after passenger John Damron of Nashua got fuel.

   Thousands of Pakistanis stranded in
Bangladesh since it broke from Pakistan 17 years ago demonstrated
Saturday to demand repatriation.
   Witnesses said 5,000 Urdu-speaking Moslems attended the rally
outside the Central Secretariat, the seat of government.
   The protesters, many carrying placards reading ``we want to go to
Pakistan,'' dispersed after they were blocked by riot police from
entering the secretariat.
   Nasim Khan, a leader of the nearly 250,000 Pakistanis awaiting
repatriation, said ``if our demand is not met soon, we will march
via India to reach Pakistan.''
   Bangladesh, a Bengali-speaking nation, is separated from Pakistan
by 870 miles of Indian territory.
   Bangladesh was the eastern wing of Urdu-speaking Pakistan when it
was formed in 1947 after gaining independence from Britain. It broke
away from Pakistan after a 1971 war.
   About 500,000 Urdu-speaking Moslems migrated in 1947 to East
Pakistan, as Bangladesh was then known, but after the war demanded
that they be sent to Pakistan.
   In the first phase of repatriation under a United Nations High
Commission for Refugees program about 250,000 were sent back, but
the program was halted when funding ran out.
   The remaining migrants live in disease- and crime-ridden shanty
communities set up in most cities in Bangladesh.
   A Jeddah-based charitable organization, Rabita-e-Alam-e-Islami,
is trying to raise $300 million from Islamic nations for the
repatriation.

   Naidoo, whose Cape Town archbishopric made him one of the most
senior members of the 2.5-million Catholic community in South
Africa, suffered from a heart condition and was resting in London on
the advice of his physicians.
   Naidoo was ordained a priest June 29, 1961 and spent 14 years
working abroad. He returned to his native country in 1974 and was
consecrated a bishop on Sept. 15 that year.
   An outspoken critic of Pretoria's apartheid policies, Naidoo was

Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Allan Boesak, president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches.

   Alva Sole, a U.S. Airmail Service pioneer
who delivered mail to Franklin D. Roosevelt and was a friend of
World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker, died Thursday at age 99.
   In air mail's infancy, Sole would swoop down, aim his
canvas-covered biplane at two posts on the ground, fly between them
and snatch a mail pouch from a wire stretched overhead before
climbing back into the air.
   Highlights of Sole's career included flying mail to Roosevelt at
Warm Springs, Ga., and taking Roosevelt's son, Elliott, on plane
rides. He flew planes with Will Rogers.
   Sole was born in Wheeling, W.Va., in 1889 and as a teen-ager went
to work shoveling coal on a train. He landed a job as a mail clerk
on a train and worked his way up to become head of the postal
service's Atlanta office in 1933.

   A cocaine user who fell asleep on her

his suffocation.
   Four years ago, another of her children died as a result of

   Dorothy Washington, 23, was arrested Thursday and ordered held on
$15,000 bond, police said. A day earlier she had been accepted into
a state drug rehabilitation program.
   The death of Washington's 4-month-old daughter in 1985 had been

case would not be reopened.
   Washington had been on a cocaine binge when she feel asleep on a

according to a police affidavit. When her boyfriend, the child's
father, awoke her the next morning, the child was face down beneath
her.
   A pretrial hearing was set for July 10. Washington's mother was

   The Awaad family was packed and ready to
move to their new home, so away they went. But they forgot just one
thing _ 4-year-old Mohammed.
   Valerie Cargo, whose husband manages the apartments where the
family lived, said the little boy was left behind for almost four
hours before his parents alerted police from their new home and sent
an older sister back to look for him.
   Cargo said she found Mohammed crying in his family's former
apartment Thursday afternoon. ``He thought everybody had left him.
He was pretty hysterical,'' she said.
   She said she didn't know where the Awaads had moved, so she took
the boy to her apartment.
   The Awaads had left in separate cars with their other four
children for their new home in Union City, a few miles north of
Fremont.
   Police said it wasn't until the parents compared notes later that
they realized Mohammed had been left behind. Officers said no
official report would be made about the incident. The boy and his
family were safely and happily reunited.

   Striking United Mine Workers members blocked
coal trucks and damaged two vehicles Friday in an attempt to halt
shipments by non-union coal companies, authorities said.
   Gov. Gaston Caperton said he had not heard from The Pittston Co.,
parent company of Pittston Coal Group, about his latest offer to let
the UMW and Pittston use his home or office for negotiations to
settle the strike.
   ``They have obviously decided they don't want to respond
affirmatively to the letter I sent,'' Caperton said, declining
further comment.
   Caperton twice in the past week has invited the two sides to meet
in Charleston and settle the strike. The UMW has accepted both times
and Pittston now has rejected both offers.
   After a closed meeting of about 1,000 UMW members in Logan on
Friday morning, about 150 miners drove to Kenova, where they blocked
trucks trying to leave a non-union coal-loading terminal on the Big
Sandy River.
   Many miners wore bandanas over their faces despite state law that
prohibits West Virginians from covering their faces in public. State
troopers showed up but made no arrests, warning to the miners of
heavy traffic on U.S. 52.
   About 1,900 UMW members are on strike against Pittston in
Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia, and their strike that began
April 5 has spawned wildcat walkouts by at least 37,000 miners in
eight states.
   In Alabama on Friday, bullets apparently were fired at a coal
barge and a coal truck in Walker County. A coal barge moving along
the Warrior River near Cordova reportedly was fired on, and a truck
received gunshot damage while parked near Jasper, sheriff's deputies
said. No one was injured.
   In West Virginia, four men who identified themselves as
furloughed miners were arrested Thursday night after power was cut
to the New Elk Mining Co. mine near Horse Creek while miners worked
inside, state police said Friday.
   Federal charges of cutting power to an operating mine were
pending, troopers said.
   On Friday, 300 members of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
union walked off the job at an Alloy metals plant for half an hour
in support of the Pittston strikers.
   It was the first walkout by another union in support of the UMW
in this strike; members of the United Steelworkers in Pennsylvania
have refused to cross UMW picket lines, however.
   And with an eye to shootings and rock-throwing incidents that
have marred the strikes in recent days, UMW officials in Pikeville,
Ky., banned strikers from setting off fireworks on the picket lines
over the Fourth of July weekend.
   ``Just to preserve our image that this is a peaceful picket, it
would be in our best interest not to have any fireworks on the
picket line,'' said Glenn Stanley, president of UMW Local 5737.
``The sounds could be confusing.''
   The Pittston strike began peacefully. But there has been
scattered violence since the wildcat strikes began, including some
shootings in West Virginia and Alabama.

   Detroit Free Press senior managing editor Neil
Shine ended his career Friday the same place he started it 39 years
ago _ on the street.
   When Shine arrived for his last day of work, the retiring
journalist found the contents of his office, including his computer,
telephone and coffee machine, set up on a sidewalk in front of the
Free Press building.
   ``The entire office was empty, not a stick of furniture, not a
picture, nothing,'' said Shine.
   The prank was the idea of three reporters who wanted to mark
Shine's last day.
   ``One lady thought it was a circulation promotion and I signed
her up for daily and Sunday. We need every subscription we can
get,'' said Shine. ``Some guy walked out of the building and thought
we'd gone bankrupt.''
   Shine couldn't speak long because customer service workers were
passing around passes for free kisses.
   ``Numbers 65 and 66 are waiting,'' Shine said. ``Duty calls.''
   Heath J Meriwether, Free Press executive editor, said Shine
wasn't really leaving the paper, since he would continue writing his
column twice a week.
   ``It is gratifying that a man who has meant so much to our
readers the last 39 years is being remembered in a way he'll
appreciate,'' said Meriwether. ``He started as a street reporter and
he's ending up on the street.''

   Communist leaders have asked Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski to reconsider his decision not to run for the powerful
new office of president because the party chief said he feared he
would be an obstacle to national unity.
   In dramatic comments Friday before the party Central Committee,
Jaruzelski instead endorsed Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak,
who last April helped negotiate the relegalization of the trade
union Solidarity. Jaruzelski spearheaded the 1981 martial law
crackdown and outlawing of Solidarity.
   Today, Solidarity members of the National Assembly are to meet on
the presidency. Many have said they could not vote for Jaruzelski,
but Solidarity was not expected to champion its own candidate for
the office, which is roughly equivalent to that now held by the
Soviet's Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Late Friday, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa flew to Warsaw and was
reported to be closeted with his top advisers.

jumped, and was in critical condition early today. Four other people
were killed.
   ``I wasn't calm. I was scared to death. I think I said `We're

   The Energy Department has tentatively agreed to
pay at least $73 million to Ohio residents who claimed damage by
radioactive contamination from a government-owned plant near Fernald
that produces nuclear weapons materials.
   A lawsuit filed by five residents as a class action had sought
$300 million.
   The settlement underscores the government's intensified effort to
regain public confidence in its nuclear weapons program, which is
run from 17 major plants in 12 states. Many of the sites are badly
polluted from four decades of bomb making.
   The government has acknowledged that at least 383,000 pounds of
radioactive uranium oxide dust had been released through faulty
filters at the Fernald facility since the plant opened in 1951. The
full extent of environmental damage has not been determined.

said HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams as the House Government

   The program, known as ``coinsurance'' because the government
assumed part of the liability on loans with lenders, showed signs of
problems two years after it was instituted in 1983 as a hallmark of
Reagan administration efforts to turn the functions of many
government programs over to private business.
   A November 1985 internal audit of eight projects showed
``inappropriate lender underwriting practices caused inflated

   The parental consent law, passed by the General Assembly in 1988,

Court was expected to announce action on a Missouri law seeking to
limit legalized abortion.
   ``The statute's vagueness can be expected to have a substantial
chilling effect upon a minor's right to obtain an abortion,'' U.S.

<HEAD>Charles Kimbrough Says `Murphy Brown' Character Really a Romantic</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Dial, the rigid, humorless anchorman on
CBS' ``Murphy Brown,'' is really a romantic at heart.
   ``The public side that he's developed is armor-plated,'' says
Charles Kimbrough, who ought to know. He plays the co-anchor on the
show's fictional TV newsmagazine ``F.Y.I.,'' which also features
Murphy Brown (Candice Bergen), Frank Fontana (Joe Regalbuto) and
Corky Sherwood (Faith Ford).
   ``Inside he's a dreamer. He probably grew up reading Richard
Halliburton's travel adventures and wanting to be just like Edward
R. Murrow. He seems older because his values are those of an older
time. It makes him uncomfortable to have to share the show with a
former beauty queen like Corky Sherwood.
   ``He seems gruff with no sense of humor. But he can loosen up
with his friends. ... The comedy comes from the fact that he's such
a stiff. I have a fondness for that part of him that's loving and
vulnerable.''
   The thing Kimbrough says he dreads most is the comparison of Dial
to Ted Baxter on ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.''
   ``Jim's a good journalist. Ted Baxter was a very bad journalist.
Jim's a smart guy, Ted was pretty dumb.''
   The role is the first real television exposure for Kimbrough. He
has spent most of his acting career on the stage in regional and
repertory companies, and got his ``big break'' with his Broadway
debut in ``Cop-Out.'' He also was in ``Company'' and ``Sunday in the
Park with George.''
   ``I was mostly working in the theater and making money doing
commercials. I'd occasionally do a movie or a part on television.
When I was asked to do an audition tape for `Murphy Brown' I figured
it was just a ticket to oblivion. You sit in front of a camera and
they put a bright light in your face.
   ``I loved the script and I wanted to do it. After the audition
tape I walked in the rain, feeling very depressed. Three weeks later
they asked me to fly to Los Angeles. I found out I was competing
against one of my best friends. They put us up in the same hotel and
we laughed about it. We both wanted it a lot. I flew back to New
York and was doing a commercial on location in Long Island when they
called and said I had the part.''
   Kimbrough grew up in the Chicago area, where his only early
connection with the theater was an aunt, Emily Kimbrough, who with
Cornelia Otis Skinner wrote ``Our Hearts Were Young and Gay.'' The
book about two young women traveling in Europe was adapted for the
stage, and was made into a movie in 1944.
   ``I grew up listening to music and doing a lot of drawing and
painting. I went to Indiana University _ and I've never told this to
anyone _ because they had a great opera department. I thought it
would be wonderful to go to a school where I could go to the opera
on Saturday night.
   ``I tried out for a school play and got a part. My grade average
went from a `B' to a `C' overnight because I was closing the
pizzeria every night with people who liked what I liked.
   ``I was in a lot of plays but it was too scary to call myself an
actor. When I went to the Yale Drama School I took directing
instead, but I spent most of my time acting.''
   Kimbrough met his wife, Mary Jane Wilson, at Yale. After
graduating they landed roles in ``All in Love,'' a musical
adaptation of Richard Sheridan's ``The Rivals.'' ``I was making
Equity scale and taking home $37.32. Jane was non-Equity and took
home $10 a week. They paid us in cash so it seemed like more. After
that we got out of the business for a while.''
   Wilson taught college and Kimbrough worked at a record club, but
they both returned to the stage in the Chicago version of a Julius
Monk revue. That was followed by three years with the Hartford Stage
Co. and six in Milwaukee.
   Despite directing classes at Yale, Kimbrough says he hasn't spent
much time in that capacity. ``I directed a few plays but I hated to
be the unpopular one in the company. If you tell an actor what to do
I'd always worry about it.''

<HEAD>Fireworks Booming For Now but Future Supplies Could Fizzle</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   While millions of Americans twirl sparklers, set off firecrackers
and ooh and aah over Fourth of July fireworks displays, U.S.
importers are getting headaches worrying about future festivities.
   ``There certainly is considerable concern for the 1990 season,''
says John Conkling, executive director of the American Pyrotechnics
Association. ``Everybody is awaiting word from factories in China
about the status of future deliveries.''
   So, before the last wisp of smoke has cleared on July 4, many
fireworks firms will have placed next year's orders in anticipation
of a possible shortage due to China's precarious political and
economic situation.
   The Chinese, credited with inventing fireworks about 1,000 years
ago, make the bulk _ more than 75 percent _ of the stuff U.S.
consumers use during Independence Day celebrations.
   Giving people such fleeting thrills as they get from lighting
Roman candles takes U.S. companies months of planning, negotiating
and waiting for shipments _even in the best of circumstances.
   U.S. fireworks firms normally have their overseas ordering done
by the autumn of each year to allow enough time for foreign
factories to manufacture and ship the goods early enough for
distribution in the United States before July.
   Now, however, the uncertainty of Chinese supplies has companies
scrambling to keep from being caught short next Fourth of July, by
far the biggest time of year for the fireworks business.
   Current supplies should be enough to satisfy this season's
demand; most imported Chinese fireworks had already arrived in the
United States or left China's shores before the Beijing government's
bloody crackdown on pro-democracy activists.
   ``The shipments for this year started arriving in the United
States back in November of 1988,'' observed John D. Rogers, a
fireworks expert at the Consumer Product Safety Commission. ``So the
majority of them were already here or on the water.''
   Phil Grucci, a member of the family that runs one of the
country's biggest organizers of fireworks shows, says intermediaries
that handle his company's purchases abroad have advised Grucci not
to panic. Nonetheless, the Bellport, N.Y.-based Fireworks by Grucci
Inc. expects a slowdown in Chinese production.
   ``We've already placed our purchase orders (to China) now to try
to beat the rush,'' Grucci said. ``We usually don't make big orders
until August or September to overseas.''
   Firms like Grucci that specialize in aerial displays don't rely
on China as much as companies do that primarily provide fireworks
for consumer use. Besides what it imports from China, Grucci
supplements its own products with fireworks from numerous foreign
sources including Japan, Taiwan and other Far Eastern countries as
well as ones in Europe.
   Royce Trout, of Atlas Enterprises Inc. in Fort Worth, Texas, a
fireworks maker and importer that ships throughout the country, says
manufacturing in China's northern provinces is more likely to be
affected by political unrest than factories elsewhere in the country.
   This is because most of the turmoil seems to have flared up
around China's economically developed areas and educational centers,
he says.
   Potential production snarls won't hit all types of fireworks.
Factories assembling firecrackers, a highly labor-intensive task,
mainly are located in the more rural part of China's southern
provinces so firecracker shipments aren't likely to be disrupted,
says Trout.
   Adding to problems that might arise from developments on the
political front, Trout says he's been informed that several Chinese
factories are facing financial trouble.
   A lack of credit to cover material and other costs has put three
or four factories in Hunan Province in danger of closing. The
southeastern province annually accounts for about 15 percent of
China's total fireworks shipments to the United States, which came
to more than 50 million pounds in 1987, the most recent year for
which U.S. government figures were available.
   Tightness in availability of one of Atlas Enterprises' most
popular items probably reflects these financial difficulties. The
item is a type of ground spinner _ a category of fireworks that
China created _ that spews fiery blossoms as it gyrates on the
ground. Ground spinners are tubes packed with a an assortment of
fireworks producing multiple effects.
   ``I'm very, very worried about what kind of supply we'll get from
some provinces both from a political standpoint and a financial
standpoint,'' says Trout.
   People in the fireworks business say there are only a few
countries that could help fill a potential shortfall in Chinese
shipments. And, there are limits to how much places such as Hong
Kong, Taiwan and Macao, the Portuguese-administered territory off
China's southeastern coast, could compensate.
   Conkling of the pyrotechnics trade group says fireworks are an
important export for China.
   The country was becoming a powerful force in fireworks just
before former President Richard Nixon reopened trade with the
country in the early 1970s. It has come to dominate the industry
today, largely because its factories turn out products of acceptable
quality at unbeatable prices due to low labor costs.
   ``Fireworks is a legitmate science in China _ universities do
research into pyrotechnics and fireworks and this translates into
big business for the country,'' says Conkling.
   For years, China has kept fireworks prices down, very close to
the cost of production, to attract customers. But U.S. businesses
say that even before the political problems they were told to expect
price hikes of 15 percent to 30 percent for next season's orders as
the Chinese try to eke out more profit.
   U.S. retail sales of fireworks will total about $200 million this
year, the industry says.
   Government figures indicate China supplies about 76 percent by
weight of all fireworks brought into the United States but the
industry says the figures probably understate Chinese imports.
   As China's shipments have grown, the quality has been slipping,
possibly because newer factories aren't as familiar with U.S.
regulations. All imported fireworks must meet the same safety
standards as domestically made products.
   Trout, who also is president of the industry's trade association,
says the group has been working on a sort of self-regulatory program
to promote consistent quality, partly to account for advances in
fireworks since government regulations were written.
   Because of China's trade dominance, the U.S. industry has been
taking special care to see that the Chinese know what's expected of
them. The industry is preparing an improved translation into Chinese
of all the requirements, set down by several U.S. agencies.
   As part of the quality campaign, U.S. industry representatives
had scheduled a trip to China in late July and early August. Now the
campaign may have to be put on hold.
   ``We are quite concerned at this point as to how the situation in
China will affect our efforts to get this quality assurance program
in place,'' said Conkling. The meeting in China, he says, ``is very
much up in the air at this point.''

<HEAD>Is There Anything Good About A Recession?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recessions, or economic downturns of the kind
Wall Street is now worrying about, have a terrible and well-deserved
reputation. But is there anything nice to be said about them?
   Lots. They remove excesses like severe inventory pileups from the
economy. They remind sellers that the consumer is still boss. They
might even be accompanied by or cause lower prices and borrowing
rates.
   What they do best, perhaps, is remind both sellers and buyers
that the old law of supply and demand is still on the books. In boom
times the seller usually has the upper hand; in bad times, the
consumer ascends.
   This pervasive impact may have shown up already in lower housing
and stock prices. And it could make even bigger inroads into the
automobile market, which for a year has been fighting its own
private battle with a slowdown.
   The automotive market, in fact, has been a display case of the
strategies that come into play when the demand-supply balance is
changing. Demand for cars has been ebbing for at least a year.
Supply, however, has remained high.
   Under such conditions the suppliers must make concessions, which
they did in the form of rebates and below-market borrowing rates.
While the Federal Reserve attempted to ease the economy into a
slower pace by raising borrowing rates, the automakers sought to
challenge them by lowering their own rates.
   It was a battle the automakers were destined to lose, because the
Fed had the ultimate power; it had the option of raising rates until
it won its way. The automakers, in contrast, could lower their rates
to zero, but not beyond.
   Conceding defeat, the automakers have sharply reduced production
in an attempt to restore seller-buyer balance. Scheduled output for
July is at an annual rate of 5 million units, or roughly half the
annual selling rate.
   The question now is whether the balance can be restored in time
to avoid price cutting. If demand remains low, the possibility
exists that companies may be unable to reduce inventories
sufficiently before new models are announced. If so, more automobile
bargains might be available. Consumers will have won.
   Over the past year housing has also demonstrated the power of
supply and demand. Demand was down, due to high prices and interest
rates. In response, and despite a recent and probably temporary
upturn, prices stagnated or fell.
   A housing market of that sort is a warning to makers of
appliances, furniture and other items associated with housing, such
as lawn products, to lower their inventories or else be forced to
lower their prices.
   If a recession does develop, and there is still no proof that one
will, there could other consumer benefits.
   Credit card issuers, for example, have clung to high interest
rates, some of them charging more than 20 percent, preferring
instead to attract customers through contests, low-cost merchandise,
travel discounts and the like.
   However, such incentives lose their drawing power when people are
in a recession mode, waiting and watching their dollars. The biggest
incentive in such an atmosphere might be lower interest charges.
   Sellers of nonessential purchases might be forced to win
customers through price cuts. Among them are airlines, resorts,
hotels, various entertainment outlets and restaurants, all of which
have been raising prices.
   Eating out, for example, already has suffered a hit, as economist
Edward Yardeni points out. From 1982 to 1987, restaurant meal sales
rose from $112.9 billion a year to $133.4 billion a year. They
peaked at a $139 billion rate in January of this year; by May the
rate was down 14 percent to $132 billion.
   When restaurateurs see figures such as these, they know what must
be done _ cut prices. True, they have the option of dramatically
improving the quality of food and service. But in a recession, price
cuts are much better.
   Price cuts are nice, but not the recession that produces them.
Most people, it seems safe to say without a survey, would opt for
expansion and pay raises instead.
   That leads to the ultimate good thing to be said about a
recession: It is the base for the next expansion, for more jobs,
higher pay and lots of spending options.

<HEAD>Junk-Bond Mutual Funds: Tempting, But Dangerous For The Uninformed</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 15th graf, Vanguard has ..., to CORRECT April figure and

<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Investors have been pouring money into junk-bond
mutual funds in recent months as interest rates available elsewhere
have fallen, but they may be unaware of the danger lurking in these
tempting, high-yield investments.
   ``Many people hear the word `bonds' and they think `safe,
conservative,''' said Neal Litvack of Fidelity Investments, operator
of one of the largest junk-bond funds. ``Junk bonds have a tendency
to dance to a different drummer.''
   That drummer is the state of the economy. Unlike investment-grade
corporate bonds, junk bonds face a greater danger of plummeting in
price in a recession.
   Junk bonds are bonds that carry a low credit rating as determined
by credit-rating agencies. Their low rating reflects the fact that
the companies that issued the bonds may be deep in debt or otherwise
poor credit risks.
   Junk bonds also are used to raise cash for many leveraged
takeovers, where the corporate raider takes on a great deal of debt
in order to pay for the target company.
   In contrast, investment-grade corporate bonds are considered a
conservative, safe investment because the issuing company is rated
financially sound and considered able to meet its debt obligations
even in a downturn.
   To make up for their extra risk, junk bonds pay a higher interest
rate. Junk bond mutual funds have been yielding 12 percent or more
recently, compared with about 9 percent for investment-grade bond
funds and 8 percent for Treasury bond funds.
   Litvack said the assets of Fidelity's junk-bond mutual fund
surged from $1.7 billion at the end of March to about $2 billion
last week.
   While most investment companies would be happy to see their
investment funds grow, Boston-based Fidelity is concerned. It
believes many of the new investors _ some of whom pulled money out
of other, safer Fidelity mutual funds _ don't know what they're
getting into.
   ``Right now there is a misperception about what drives the
performance of these securities,'' said Litvack, Fidelity's vice
president of marketing. ``Interest rates are not the primary driver
of these funds; it's much more a function of the economy.''
   With investment-grade bonds, declining interest rates usually
lead to higher bond prices. That's because bonds keep paying the
same fixed interest while rates available elsewhere are becoming
less attractive.
   But junk-bond traders are more concerned about the financial
health of the companies that issued the bonds. If the economy sours,
these companies would be at risk of not earning enough to pay the
interest on the bonds, or even of outright default.
   ``A lot of these (junk) bonds haven't been tested in a down
market,'' said Brian S. Mattes, a spokesman for the Vanguard Group,
another major mutual-fund operator.
   ``There could be a stampede out of the fund in a recession,'' he
said. ``There will be a lot of people running for the door at the
same time. In fact, the price may go down more because of that.''
   Vanguard has seen the assets of its junk-bond fund grow 13
percent in the past two months, from about $1.14 billion at the end
of April to about $1.29 billion last week. Some is from appreciation
and the rest from new investors.
   Mattes said Vanguard, based in Valley Forge, Pa., sent brochures
to its customers to warn them of the risks of its junk-bond fund.
   ``It should not be viewed as a short-term investment at all,'' he
said. Long-term investors would be at a lesser risk of losing
principal because they could ride out an economic downturn.
   Investors expecting declining interest rates should put their
money in Treasury funds, Litvack said.
   In fact, total return on Treasury bonds _ the total interest paid
plus any change in the bond prices _ exceeded that of the
higher-yielding junk bonds in the first five months of this year.
   The January-May return on seven-year Treasury bonds exceeded 6
percent, while Fidelity's junk-bond fund returned only 2.26 percent
and Vanguard's returned 2.12 percent due to major declines in the
price of these bonds as the economy slowed, according to Lipper
Analytical Services Corp.
   Litvack said junk-bond funds are not for investors saving for
retirement or other needs.
   One major mutual-fund company, Dreyfus Corp., said it is so
concerned about the risks of junk-bond funds that it doesn't sponsor
one.
   ``The underlying basis for junk bonds is that economic expansion
will continue forever, enabling highly leveraged companies to meet
their heavy debt burdens,'' said Howard Stein, Dreyfus' chairman and
chief executive.
   Dreyfus, he said, is not that optimistic.

<HEAD>In Business, Defeated Soldiers Rise To Fight Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Recent events show that in modern business,
unlike modern warfare, defeated soldiers often rise to fight again
another day.
   Indicted but undaunted, junk-bond king Michael Milken announced
June 15 _ the day of his resignation from Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. _ that he was striking out on his own in a new firm.
   Milken might have trouble getting clients since he faces $1.85
billion in forfeitures and a lengthy jail term if convicted on fraud
and racketeering charges. But at age 42, he's willing to give it a
shot.
   T. Boone Pickens is another resilient loser. After being told
repeatedly that he could not have three seats on the board of a
Japanese auto parts maker, the Texas oilman went to the company's
annual meeting in Tokyo anyway. The answer remained the same _ no _
but he said he would press on.
   Arthur Goldberg spent this past week trying to extricate himself
from what he called an ``embarrassing situation.'' His company,
Integrated Resources Inc., had just defaulted on $955 million in
short-term debt. By the end of the week he had patched together a
refinancing plan with the help of Drexel that just might win
grudging approval of creditors.
   Even those prophets of cold nuclear fusion, Martin Fleischmann
and Stanley Pons, showed it was too soon to write them off entirely.
General Electric Co. announced this past week it would collaborate
with the University of Utah on tabletop fusion in spite of
scientists' widespread skepticism.
   There are other irrepressible figures out there: Bennett S.
LeBow, the oft-defeated bidder for Prime Computer Inc., and Jerry
Tucker, the oft-defeated leader of the New Directions dissident
movement of the United Auto Workers.
   What unites the diverse characters is a fine understanding of the
nature of capitalism, which may be the greatest recycling machine
ever invented.
   As long as an enterprise or an idea has any value, speculators
and entrepreneurs will find a way to extract it, like a scavenger
who strips the battery from an abandoned car. There is money, or a
reputation, to be made.
   People like Milken and Pickens know the odds against them are
long, but that just makes the potential returns sweeter. The same
goes for GE, which undoubtedly is getting a cheaper deal with Utah
than if other companies were also clamoring to get in on cold
fusion. The investment might just pay off big. That's capitalism.
   Charles Darwin wrote in ``The Origin of Species'' that the tree
of life ``fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the
earth.'' If Darwin had worked on Wall Street, he might have gone on
to observe that those dead branches sometimes carry the seeds for
even taller trees.
   In other business news this past week:
   _Stock investors changed their minds about the economy. Signs of
an economic slowdown used to cheer investors by raising prospects
for lower interest rates. But this past week fears of recession
spread, especially after the government reported a
larger-than-expected decline in the index of leading economic
indicators for May.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 91.81 points in the
week, its biggest weekly drop since 108.42 points the week of March
21-25, 1988.
   _The biggest takeover fight of the moment headed into the weekend
with Time Inc. shareholders re-electing a slate of directors who
oppose a $12.2 billion bid for Time by Paramount Communications Inc.
The directors instead favor a $14 billion offer by Time for Warner
Communications Inc., which they say would create a powerful
communications company.
   _And finally, the Bank of Canada stopped issuing dollar bills
Friday in the latest step of a program to phase in the 11-sided,
gold-colored ``loonie'' coin.

<HEAD>Tide Turning on Wall Street?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whether they are out in yachts or rowboats this
July Fourth weekend, a lot of stock-market investors are surely
wondering whether the currents have shifted on Wall Street.
   In the last few days leading up to midyear, the negative economic
news that has been enthusiastically received for months in the
financial world suddenly wasn't so welcome any more.
   What appeared to be the turning point was the government's report
Wednesday that the index of leading economic indicators, a primary
statistical tool for measuring future trends, took a
larger-than-expected 1.2 percent drop in May.
   That reinforced the prevailing view that the economy was slowing,
fulfilling a primary goal of recent Federal Reserve policy. And it
seemed to increase the chances that the Fed would move more
aggressively to ease credit conditions before long.
   Following the standard script, interest rates fell in the bond
market, reducing the competitive appeal of bonds and money-market
investments in comparison to stocks.
   But the stock market, instead of rising, embarked on a steep
decline that lasted through the end of the week. Maybe, traders
seemed to be thinking, the slowdown is happening too fast.
   It didn't help much that several technical analysts, who
concentrate on trends within the market itself rather than
developments in the economy, were warning that stocks were ripe for
a setback.
   ``The stock and bond markets and the U.S. dollar are about to
enter into a prolonged consolidation phase that could drag through
the entire third quarter,'' said Joseph Barthel, technical analyst
at Butcher &amp; Singer Inc.
   ``The end result of these expected consolidations will be to
relieve the overbought and overbelieved conditions now surrounding
the three markets.''
   ``The market's headed for a fall,'' declared Joseph Feshbach at
Prudential-Bache Securities. ``Our caution flag for the second half
is at full staff.''
   Investors didn't wait for the second half to act on those
warnings and fears. In the last week of what had been a robust,
prosperous first half for the bulls, stocks took their sharpest drop
in more than a year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 91.81 points to
2,440.06, for its largest weekly loss since it tumbled 108.42 points
March 21-25, 1988.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 4.96 to
177.90; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 13.07 to 435.29, and the American Stock Exchange market
value index was down 5.28 at 358.97.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 162.15 million shares a day,
against 168.49 million the week before.
   To some observers, the flareup of recession worries was actually
a positive for the market's longer-term prospects.
   The ``soft landing'' thesis that all would go well for the
economy had acquired too many believers, they said, and it was
inevitable that money managers at investing institutions would begin
to question what might go wrong.
   ``Not to worry,'' advised Stephen Leeb, editor of the advisory
letter Indicator Digest. ``In postwar history we have never had a
broad-based correction in stocks when (prices of) bonds were in an
uptrend.''
   Nevertheless, the recession-or-not debate seems likely to have
climbed to a spot high on Wall Street's agenda for the immediate
future.
   If the pattern established this past week holds, that could mean
that the bond and stock markets diverge from the parallel paths they
have followed for much of the 1980s.
   Fears of deflation prevailing over fears of inflation might fuel
strong demand for high-quality interest-bearing securities like
Treasury bonds, while leaving investors leery of stocks and
lower-quality debt such as ``junk'' bonds.

<HEAD>Coffee Prices Percolate Amid Jitters Over Price Support Pact</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with settlement prices and other action
Friday.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fear that discord among the world's major coffee producers will
spark a collapse of the market's 26-year-old price-support machinery
kept the coffee futures market on edge this past week.
   Traders' caffeine jitters were tempered late in the week by hopes
that members of the International Coffee Organization will find a
way to avert a crisis.
   On other markets, precious metals slumped but ended the week on a
strong note; energy prices see-sawed in volatile trading; wheat
started strong but dipped by week's end; corn and soybean prices
were mostly stronger; and meat and livestock prices were mixed.
   The latest signal of hope in the coffee market, unconfirmed
reports that the ICO may decide to postpone a vote on whether to
extend the agreement with some sort of price-support mechanism in
place, sent prices soaring Friday at New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange.
   The current six-year price-support deal is due to expire Sept.
30, and member nations of the ICO, composed of 74 major coffee
producers and consumers, are at odds over proposals for a new
agreement.
   Members of the ICO are scheduled to vote Monday on two
price-support proposals. One would extend the existing agreement as
is, with no change in quotas. The other calls for extension with
changes that would increase the availability of mild arabica coffees
_ one of the most popular varieties.
   Adding to the confusion is a recommendation from the ICO's
executive board to extend the pact for two years, but to abolish its
price-stabilizing quota machinery. The result would leave coffee
prices after Sept. 30 subject to free-market forces for the first
time since 1963.
   The board, which met Thursday and Friday, also called for an ICO
vote on immediate suspension of the quota system if it rejects the
two proposals, as some analysts have predicted it will do.
   The executive board acts merely as an advisory group, and the
full ICO is not bound by its recommendation.
   ``It's a very nervous market simply because it is being pushed
around by these very contradictory statements,'' Arthur Stevenson,
an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, said
Friday. ``Prices have been extremely erratic,'' he said.
   The reports that the ICO may postpone the vote for several weeks
was considered bullish ``because it would imply that if they do,
then the producers and the consumers will have more time to reach a
compromise,'' Stevenson said.
   But the week opened on a bearish note, with reports that
Colombia, the world's second largest coffee producer, would move to
abolish all export quotas unless the ICO can agree on one of the two
proposals.
   That sent coffee futures prices plunging 1.63 cents to 6.05 cents
Monday, with the July contract at $1.11 a pound _ the market's
lowest close since Aug. 2, 1988.
   But they rebounded Wednesday on vague hopes for a solution, and
again on Friday, settling .50 cent to 3.25 cents higher, with the
July contract at $1.1137 a pound.

   Gold, silver and platinum prices started their slide early in the
week at New York's Commodity Exchange on the strength of the dollar,
falling sharply later on further signs that the U.S. economy is
heading for a recession. But the dollar's weakening Friday added a
firm tone to the market.

   Crude oil started the week with a bang at the New York Mercantile
Exchange on continued concerns about supply and technical factors.
Heating oil and gasoline also started the week higher, but gas
prices plunged Wednesday after the release of the weekly American
Petroleum Institute report showing an increase in refinery activity.
Energy prices rebounded Thursday, but gas prices closed lower on
Friday.

   Heavy buying in the wheat pit at the Chicago Board of Trade was
sparked by anticipation of major purchases of U.S. wheat by the
Soviets. But by Friday a forecast for good harvesting conditions put
pressure on the wheat market, while a revised, dry forecast in corn
and soybean growing regions sparked a rally in those pits.

   Prices opened the week strong at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
but became mixed as traders awaited Friday's quarterly hogs and pigs
report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   Here are some commodity price trends for the past week:
   Wheat for delivery in July settled Friday at $3.97\ a bushel,
down slightly from $3.97{ a week earlier; July corn rose to $2.66} a
bushel from $2.62; July oats fell to $1.49{ from $1.52{; and July
soybeans increased to $7.35 a bushel from $7.31.
   Live cattle for delivery in August settled at 70.15 cents a
pound, up from 69.87 cents last Friday; August feeder cattle dipped
to 80.87 cents a pound from 81.12 cents a week earlier; July hogs
fell to 48.67 cents a pound from 49.67 cents; and July pork bellies
rallied to 35.85 cents a pound from 33.67 cents.
   Gold for delivery in August fell to $377.30 a troy ounce from
$381.80 while July silver settled at $5.155 a troy ounce, down from
$5.338.
   August crude oil rose to $20.27 a barrel from $19.71 a week
earlier; July heating oil fell to 49.35 cents a gallon from 49.49
cents; and unleaded gasoline for delivery in July settled at 59.91
cents a gallon, down from 62.92 cents.
