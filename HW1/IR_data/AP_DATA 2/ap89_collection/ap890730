   Relatives of two New Mexico youths who
vanished last year said Sunday they're pretty sure their children
were shown gagged in a mysterious photograph that appeared on
national television last week.
   The ``tabloid'' television news show ``A Current Affair''
broadcast Friday in New Mexico had a segment on the mystery
picture, a Polaroid snapshot found June 15 in the Florida Panhandle
city of Port St. Joe.
   The relatives of Tara Calico and Michael Henley Jr. believe the
picture is the first evidence that the missing youths are still
alive, perhaps in captivity in Florida.
   Tara was 19 when she disappeared in September while bicycling on
a country road near Belen, about 30 miles south of Albuquerque in
central New Mexico.
   Michael Henley Jr. was 10 when he disappeared on a camping trip
with his father in the Zuni Mountains south of Grants, about 70
miles west of Albuquerque in April 1988.
   The picture shows a young woman and boy with gags taped across
their mouths, lying with their arms behind them. They are shown in
a white van, Cibola County (N.M.) Sheriff Ed Craig said Sunday.
   ``It's the best lead we've had in 16 months,'' Craig said. Until
now, he said, there had been no sign of a kidnap in the boy's
disappearance. It was generally assumed he had become lost in the
wilderness.
   Reportedly, the woman who found the photo in a store parking lot
said a white van had been parked over the spot where the picture
was found.
   ``If I had to say yes or no, I would say yes, but I am
qualifying it until I see the photo,'' Tara's mother, Pat Doel,
said Sunday.
   The search for Ms. Calico had been swift and thorough, she said,
and ``we felt we would have found her body. We didn't. We covered
every inch of ground around here.''
   She said she is taking pictures of Tara with her Monday to Port
St. Joe, about 30 miles southeast of Panama City, to inspect the
Polaroid snapshot.
   Sheriff Craig showed a videotape of the ``Current Affair''
segment to Michael's father, family and friends Sunday at sheriff's
headquarters in Grants, N.M.
   ``The majority of the family believes that that's Michael,''
Henley Sr. said after the viewing. ``Michael's best friend believes
that's Michael. His sister believes it's Michael.''
   Henley said his wife also believes the photo is of their son,
but he isn't so sure. ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Maybe it's just
because I don't want to see my son like that.''
   After ``A Current Affair'' was telecast Friday in New Mexico,
relatives called Mrs. Doel saying the girl in the photograph
resembled her daughter.
   Like Henley, Mrs. Doel said she wasn't sure at first if the girl
was Tara.
   ``She used to keep herself fixed up, and had a permanent in her
hair,'' she said. ``Before the perm, without the makeup ... I got
out the old pictures, and it's her.''
   A friend of Ms. Calico, Cynthia Tafoya, agreed.
   ``It's her. Everything ... the features, everything,'' Ms.
Tafoya said.
   She said there is a clue in the photograph _ a book by the
author V.C. Andrews. Ms. Tafoya said the book was Ms. Calico's
favorite. ``We used to trade (Andrews' books) all the time,'' Ms.
Tafoya said.
   Sheriff Craig and Valencia County Sheriff Lawrence Romero, who
investigated Tara's disappearance, said they will contact Florida
investigators.

   The Soviet Union and China agreed Sunday to hold
talks in November to discuss reductions in their armed forces along
the Chinese-Soviet border, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   Tass, in a dispatch from Paris, said Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen agreed
at a meeting that the talks would be held in Moscow.
   Shevardnadze and Quian are in Paris participating in an
international peace conference on Cambodia.
   Tass said the two ministers noted ``with satisfaction that since
the normalization of Soviet-Chinese relations at the summit meeting
in Beijing last May useful work has been done to translate into
life the impressive potential of cooperation between the Soviet
Union and China in economics, science and culture.''
   It said Sunday's agreement calls for ``holding the first meeting
of diplomatic and military experts in Moscow next November to
consider cuts in the armed forces in areas adjacent to the
Soviet-Chinese border and confidence-building measures in the
military sphere.''
   Tass reported the two countries will hold a fourth round of
talks on border issues in Beijing in October.
   It described the ministers' meeting as ``businesslike and
constructive ... held in a friendly atmosphere.''

<TEXT>
   Voters Sunday overwhelmingly approved
constitutional reforms that would legalize Marxist political
activities and reduce presidential powers, according to partial
official returns.
   President Augusto Pinochet, the army commander and head of the
military government, called the vote historic and said it ``has
shown the Chilean people's capacity to reach national unity.''
   The armed forces, which have ruled Chile for nearly 16 years,
``have vowed in a solmen manner'' to ensure that the constitution
will be respected by all citizens, he said in a nationally
televised address.
   The government and the opposition support the proposed reforms,
which drew little voter interest prior to the balloting.
   The government said that with 14,109 of the nation's 23,000
polling stations reporting, the referendum was passing by a vote of
676,933 to 363,926; 256,687 ballots were invalid or blank.
   There were 54 proposed constitutional changes in the package
presented to the voters.
   Andres Zaldivar, president of the centrist Christian Democratic
Party that is the largest opposition group, said the reforms
``allow us to begin the construction of a real democracy.''
   But he reiterated his position that further reforms are needed.
   
   Delays were reported in the opening of some polling stations
around the country. Authorities blamed bad weather, especially in
the south, and a lack of public transportation in Santiago and some
other cities.
   The government reported virtually all of the polls were open by
midmorning. It said voting, slow during the early hours, increased
during the day and that 80 percent of the eligible voters cast
ballots in some districts.
   Voting is mandatory, and citizens who fail to cast a ballot may
be fined more than $90, a steep amount in a country where about a
third of the 4.5 million labor force earns the $66 monthly minimum
wage.
   However, there was little voter interest in the referendum,
agreed upon in advance by the government and its foes. Several
small political groups opposed it.
   Experts said citizens were confused by the long, often highly
technical text of the amendments.
   Among the early voters was Gen. Pinochet, who cast his ballot at
a downtown school.
   Pinochet, 73, has ruled since a 1973 military coup overthrew
elected President Salvador Allende, a self-proclaimed Marxist.
Pinochet agreed to amend the constitution only after voters in
October rejected a proposal by the military to extend his rule
until 1997.
   He then called presidential and congressional elections, now
scheduled for Dec. 14. The elected officials are to take office
March 11.
   The military has said the proposed constitutional changes aim at
``improving'' the constitution. The opposition agreed, but called
the reforms insufficient and said they would seek more changes once
the new Congress convenes.
   The constitution, written by the military government, was
approved in a 1980 referendum that the opposition considers a fraud.
   The proposed changes would ease restrictions on Marxist
activities, which are banned under the present constitution. The
changes would effectively legalize Marxism, experts say.
   Other amendments would make future constitutional amendments
easier, shorten the presidential term from eight to four years and
eliminate the president's power to exile opponents and dissolve
Congress.
   The opposition, favored to win the congressional elections,
wants more changes, including removal of a constitutional clause
allowing Pinochet and his peers in the navy, air force and national
police to remain as commanders until 1998.
   Pinochet already has said he plans to remain army commander
after stepping down from the presidency.

<TEXT>
   Two tugboats pushed the damaged oil tanker
Exxon Valdez into San Diego Bay early Sunday for repairs of
ruptures that caused the nation's worst oil spill five months ago.
   The high-riding tanker, which was ringed by eight Coast Guard
and Harbor Patrol boats for security reasons, crawled along at 3
knots, about 3{ mph, under a gray sky.
   Dozens of pleasure boats sailed along outside the security zone,
and ships with salvage and pollution response gear trailed behind.
Boats carrying environmentalists also trailed, watching for any
signs of leakage.
   The Greenpeace organization deployed four sailboats and four
inflatable boats that carried banners stating, ``Oil Spills Kill,''
``Exxon Rules'' and ``Change The Course, Steer Toward Sane Energy.''
   Hundreds of people watched from the shoreline as the tanker
entered the bay and rounded North Island, sailing past waterfront
hotels and Navy warships. Harbor seals stared from resting spots
atop buoys.
   The long-delayed entry began after authorities said the tanker
cleared its final inspection and gave Exxon the go-ahead to bring
it in.
   The tanker, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into
Alaska's Prince William Sound when it went aground on March 24, was
originally to enter under its own power but at the last moment
tugboats were ordered to push it.
   Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg and Tom Gillette, an Exxon
Shipping Co. official, said the switch to tugboats was at the
request of a state water quality control official who wanted the
ship to be under greater control.
   The seven-mile trip into the bay began about 6 a.m. when the
Exxon Valdez was under its own power, stalled for a time for the
tugs to move in, and then resumed.
   Solberg said a final inspection by remote-controlled underwater
camera verified that the 987-foot hull was free of dangling steel
plates like those that had prevented the tanker's entry to the
harbor for weeks.
   Gillette said the plan was to enter with the rising tide, which
peaks at 9:30 a.m. The ship's transit through the bay to the
National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. dock was expected to take
several hours.
   For the past three weeks, the ship has stayed about 50 miles
from San Diego after initially being turned away as a pollution
risk. Its original entry to the bay was halted when officials
spotted a slick coming from the vessel.

   Seven young women Sunday became the first to take
vows as Catholic nuns in Beijing since the Communists took power in
1949.
   Hundreds of people crowded Beijing's Nantang Cathedral to watch
Bishop Fu Tieshan induct the women as sisters of the
state-sponsored Patriotic Catholic Church, which has no ties with
the Vatican.
   The seven bowed their heads, covered by long black veils topped
with circlets of plastic roses, as Fu admonished them to be true to
their religious training, which began in 1986.
   After the 90-minute service, the new nuns posed for photographs
with the bishop on the cathedral steps, then left for their new
life.
   ``I'm very excited,'' one said as she rushed to greet relatives
and friends. She said they would be assigned church work but that
she did not know what it would be.
   Only about 3 million of China's 1.2 billion people belong to the
Patriotic Catholic Church. Life has not been easy for them since
1949, nor for the unknown number of Catholics who still are loyal
to the Vatican and worship in illegal churches.
   Catholics and members of other religious groups repeatedly were
singled out as politically suspect during leftist campaigns in the
first decades of Communist rule, especially during the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution when all churches were closed.
   Churches, seminaries and convents began reopening over the past
decade, and training began for a new generation of priests and
nuns. Two elderly nuns who had taken vows before 1949 were given
the task of training Beijing's first new nuns.
   One of those who took vows Sunday, Sister Yang Lijun, 24, said
she and the others came from Catholic families. ``I wanted to be a
nun since I was small ... in order to serve people,'' she said.
   Churches in several other cities also began accepting candidates
to become nuns in the mid-1980s, but the official Xinhua News
Agency said in April that the group in Beijing would take its vows
first.
   Before being admitted for training as nuns or priests,
candidates are tested in political as well as religious knowledge,
and their classes include socialist theory.

<HEAD>Driver's License Found Near SOS on Mountain Slope</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reporter looking for clues about who spelled out
a giant SOS sign with birch branches on a mountain slope has found
nearby the driver's license of a man who disappeared on the
mountain in 1984.
   But police said Sunday they have not found the climber's body
nor have they identified human bones, thought to be a woman's, also
found near the SOS on the 7,514-foot Mount Asahidake on Japan's
northernmost island of Hokkaido.
   The case has been followed closely by the Japanese media since
the SOS was first spotted July 24.
   Koyo Aburatani, a reporter for the Hokkaido television station
HBC, said he found a driver's license, two cameras, a notebook and
other items in a large hole beneath the roots of some trees 165
feet from the SOS sign Saturday.
   The name on them was Kenji Iwamura of Konan City, Aichi
Prefecture.
   Police said Iwamura, then 22, set out hiking on Asahidake on
July 10, 1984. When he failed to appear for work a week later, his
parents asked police to search for him, but they found no trace.
   Police said the hole in which the license was found was large
enough for a human to crawl in.
   The English SOS letters, each measuring about 16 feet long and
10 feet wide, were first sighted July 24 by the crew of a police
helicopter searching for another missing climber. The object of
that search, a climber from Tokyo, was rescued, but he said he knew
nothing of the SOS sign.
   Near the distress sign, police found human bones and a knapsack
containing a tape recorder, a towel, soap and other articles,
including cassette tapes.
   Medical examinations said the bones belonged to a woman, but
police said Thursday that one of the tapes contained a man's voice
calling for help.
   Officers said Iwamura's parents were not sure about the voice on
the tape, but they identified articles in the knapsack as their
son's.
   Police had suspended their investigation Saturday. It was not
immediately clear whether they would reopen it because of the
reporter's findings.

   Navy officials said Sunday they have
suspended their search for an American sailor who apparently fell
overboard last week as his destroyer was patrolling the Persian
Gulf.
   They identified the missing man as Brian S. Voltz, 20, of
Springfield, Mo., a postal clerk third class aboard the USS Conolly.
   A search of the gulf 50 miles northeast of Dubai was called off
late Friday, according to Navy spokesman Joseph Bartlett.
   The crew man was reported missing from the 7,810-ton ship during
routine patrol late Wednesday. The search was launched after three
checks of the ship.
   The Conolly, with a crew of about 325, has operated with the
Navy's gulf-based Middle East Force since mid-April and is
scheduled to leave next month for home port at Norfolk, Va.

   Two weeks after Herbert von Karajan's
death, the Salzburg Festival bade farewell Sunday to its greatest
maestro and mentor in a commemorative hour of music, with no

   ``His language was music,'' said a footnote of the program to

   Karajan, who dominated the Salzburg musical scene for almost
four decades, died of heart failure July 16. He was 81.
   The ceremony at Great Festival Hall was broadcast on Austrian

   The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, under the baton of Seiji
Ozawa, George Solti and James Levine, played music by Johann
Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Johannes Brahms and Wolfgang

   The ceremony was attended by Karajan's widow, Eliette, President
Kurt Waldheim, Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and hundreds of other
guests.
   A church ceremony was held in Salzburg Cathedral on July 23.

<HEAD>Government Says U.S. Holds Cards of Peace and War in Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the Kabul government, the United
States holds the cards of war or peace when it meets the Soviet
Union on Monday to discuss Afghanistan.
   But much as the Soviet-backed government of President Najib
would like the Americans to play the peace card, it sees the war
card coming up. U.S. diplomats predict new military offensives, and
U.S.-supplied rockets pound Kabul every day.
   The meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, will be the first superpower
discussion focusing on the 10-year Afghan civil war since the last
Soviet troops left this central Asian nation Feb. 15.
   Najib has confounded Western diplomats who predicted Moslem
rebels would topple his Soviet-backed government within days of the
Soviet pullout. He remains in power while the guerrillas, who call
themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, appear to be
squabbling among themselves.
   So far, the mujahedeen have failed to win control of a major
city and have been driven back from the key city of Jalalabad, 45
miles from the Pakistan border.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani on Saturday
accused the mujahedeen of firing rockets at Kabul for the past
month to ``have something in their hand'' when the Stockholm talks
start. The long-range rockets have killed more than 200 people,
virtually all civilians.
   Six rockets hit the capital Sunday, damaging Kabul University,
destroying a factory, and killing two women, the government said.
   ``We want the U.S. to show us the peace card,'' Amani said.
``But the signals have indicated that the United States in the
Stockholm talks will be stressing a military solution.''
   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said the most important thing the
Americans and Soviets could do would be to encourage ``hostile
groups'' to start a dialogue. He also urged the superpowers to
discuss a comprehensive peace settlement.
   But Peter Tomsen, a special U.S. envoy to the mujahedeen
appointed by President Bush, has predicted a major guerrilla
offensive during the remaining fighting season, which lasts until
November snows. He told a U.S. congressional committee Thursday:
``The end is clear. The resistance will prevail.''
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, which serves as the
base for the major guerrilla groups, also has predicted intensified
war.
   In this dusty capital surrounded by hills, many diplomats and
foreigners of all stripes have their doubts about a mujahedeen
victory.
   Many are also concerned that a mujahedeen-controlled government,
likely led by Islamic fundamentalists who have received the lion's
share of U.S. military aid, would turn Afghanistan into another
Iran.
   Wakil said the Afghan government has shown it can defend itself
and predicted U.S. pursuit of the military option will fail.
   U.S. officials have been quoted as saying the rebels will get
new weapons to counter highly effective high-altitude bombing
attacks by the Afghan air force and to crater runways of Afghan air
bases.
   The Soviets want an end to hostilities. But Soviet Ambassador
Yuli M. Vorontsov, also first deputy foreign minister, told a
Western correspondent here earlier this month that he was not
optimistic.
   ``The Americans have been telling us privately what they've been
saying publicly about the arms supplies to the mujahedeen.
Therefore, we don't expect much from the beginning of the talks,''
he said.
   Another sign of low expectations is the low level of the
delegations.
   The Soviet delegation will be led by Ambassador-at-large Nikolai
I. Kozyrev, a former diplomat in Afghanistan who participated in
negotiations on the U.N.-brokered agreement that led to the
departure of Soviet troops.
   The U.S. delegation will be led by John Kelly, assistant
secretary of state for near eastern and south Asian affairs.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking anonymously, said the most
important thing that has happened on the political front is the
Soviet recognition of the mujahedeen _ and their agreement to
include the rebels in a coalition government.
   The Afghan government stresses that Najib has offered free and
fair elections under international supervision with all parties
competing, and has pledged to step down if the mujahedeen win.

   Capitol Hill is awash in proposals to tinker
with who pays what for Medicare's new catastrophic-illness
insurance program, as legislators try to appease outraged senior
citizens who feel they were stuck with a good idea gone bad.
   At issue is the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, enacted with
great fanfare last July and touted as bringing peace of mind to
millions of elderly Americans who no longer need fear their life
savings will be wiped out by staggering medical bills.
   In a sunny Rose Garden ceremony, then-President Reagan and
congressional architects of the plan hailed its innovative
financing mechanism, which requires those who benefit from the
program to shoulder all of its costs.
   A 15 percent surtax on federal income tax liabilities over $150
affects about 40 percent of those 65 and older, with the maximum
payment capped at $800 in 1989 and rising to $1,050 by 1993. Most
of the rest of the money comes from a flat supplemental premium on
all but the poorest beneficiaries, set at $4 a month in 1989 and
rising to $10.20 by 1993.
   That's where the problems began _ and the peace of mind ended.
   Some older Americans, who lobbied hard for the benefits but
didn't want to foot the bill alone, have bombarded Congress with
complaints that their payments are too high and benefits too low.
They also argue that the program should not be mandatory because
some people already have duplicate private coverage.
   ``Since almost all of us, one day, hope to benefit from the
Medicare program, society has a basic responsibility to assist in
its financing,'' said Lawrence Smedley, executive director of the
National Council of Senior Citizens.
   Spurred into action by the rebellion, legislators have
introduced a host of proposals to amend, delay or repeal the
program.
   Douglas Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, said members of Congress are ``trying to satisfy
everyone, or at least everyone who votes in large numbers.''
   ``Everyone knew this program was going to be very expensive, but
they said, `Don't worry, it's going to be self-financing',''
Besharov said. ``It turns out the deal may not be that binding.''
   In recent legislative action, the House Ways and Means Committee
last week produced a plan that would halve the income tax
surcharge, increase the supplemental Medicare premium paid by all
but the poorest, and limit the prescription drug benefit.
   In addition, senior citizens could opt out of the catastrophic
program altogether if they also dropped Part B of Medicare, which
covers doctor bills and is financed primarily by general tax
revenue.
   The proposal squeezed through on a 19-17 vote, with proponents
claiming it would ease the burden on elderly people in the middle
class, allow discontented seniors to drop out, and preserve
valuable benefits for the majority of older Americans.
   But the plan, likely to be a focal point for further debate on
the future of catastrophic coverage, is quickly attracting critics
among the very constituency it was designed to mollify.
   ``We could never support this,'' said Frances Humphreys,
executive director of the Gray Panthers. ``We want to see a better
financing plan, by all means, but we don't want to undermine the
Medicare program and we don't want to place any more of a burden on
the poor.''
   Ken Hoagland of the National Committee to Preserve Social
Security and Medicare, which has been leading the fight against the
surtax, said: ``They're still leaving the financing on senior
citizens. That's the problem.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called it ``reprehensible'' to shift
more of the costs to low-income elderly and to portray the revised
program as voluntary when few people can afford to give up Part B
of Medicare, a prerequisite for dropping catastrophic insurance.
   On a 58-40 procedural vote Thursday, the Senate rejected a
proposal by McCain that would delay implementation of the surtax
and most of the benefits for a year, giving Congress time to
rethink the whole package.
   One of the few friendly reviews of the Ways and Means package
came from the American Association of Retired Persons, which
expressed concern about the added burden for low-income
beneficiaries but called the overall plan ``a positive step toward
addressing some of the concerns which have been raised.''
   John Rother, AARP's legislative director, said the main
alternative to the committee's proposal appears to be outright
repeal, which would be ``far more regressive.''
   He said that while much of the opposition to the current program
comes from high-income older Americans who would pay the most, part
is from less affluent people who are under the mistaken impression
they would have to pay the maximum surtax.
   In fact, less than 6 percent of elderly Americans will pay the
maximum amount.
   ``This program is a great deal at a minimum for 75 percent of
older people,'' Rother said. ``They receive much more in benefits
than they are asked to pay.''
   Several other senior citizen groups have lined up behind
legislation that would repeal the surtax, retain all the
catastrophic benefits, and replace the lost revenues by extending
the 33 percent income tax to all earnings of the nation's
highest-income taxpayers, some of which now is taxed at 28 percent.
   ``It offers real tax relief to older Americans by closing a
loophole for wealthy taxpayers,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a
sponsor of that proposal.

   A U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that National
Security Archive qualifies as a media organization enables the
research group to receive discount rates for its numerous requests
for government documents under the Freedom of Information Act.
   The decision Friday stemmed from a lawsuit the National Security
Archive, a nonprofit group that compiles documents on national
security and foreign policies, brought against the Defense
Department for its refusal to classify the organization as an
educational institution or a representative of the news media.
   Either category would mean the group would not have to pay
certain ``search-and-review'' charges for Freedom of Information
Act requests, a potentially substantial benefit. Search-and review
fees at the State Department, for example, vary from $8 an hour to
$30 an hour.
   Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, writing the unanimous
decision for the three-member panel, said National Security Archive
was entitled to media status because it planned ``to act, in
essence, as a publisher'' for books such as its chronology of the
Iran-Contra affair and a 1,000-page index of documents about U.S.
involvement in El Salvador.

<HEAD>Professor Studying Fads in Babies' Names</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard sociology professor wants to know why
names suddenly rise in popularity, why there's a slew of Sarahs or
a clutch of Calvins in the same year.
   Stanley Lieberson, who has begun a scientific study of name
fads, says he first got interested in the phenomenon after choosing
what he thought was an uncommon name, Rebecca, for his eldest
daughter in 1961.
   ``In nursery school and kindergarten and through the years of
grade school and onward there were always a bunch of Beckies that
she knew,'' the professor said recently. ``Somehow there was
something out there in the society that led parents, without
talking to each other, to reach a conclusion.''
   In a search for possible social cues to parents, Lieberson began
compiling health department lists of all babies born in California
from 1905 to 1984. He also has data on upstate New York from 1973
to 1985, Wisconsin from 1979 to 1986, and various lists from other
countries.
   Lieberson got the data by writing to various agencies and taking
whatever records were available on computer tape.
   Now he'll track the rise and fall of popular names. He also will
check them against the historical backdrop _ World War I or the
Great Depression, for example _ to see if parents tend to name
their children after newsmakers.
   If that's true, for example, there might have been a crop of
boys named Douglas when World War II hero Gen. Douglas MacArthur
loomed large on front pages.
   Early findings suggest that male and female forms of a name,
such as Michael and Michelle, often become popular at the same time.
   Also, Lieberson said, ``The rate of change appears to move more
rapidly that it used to be.''
   Parents tend to be more creative naming girls and give boys
conservative monikers, he said.
   An exception is the name Gary, which was popular, Lieberson
notes, at a time when film star Gary Cooper swapped his real name,
Frank, for that of an Indiana steel town.
   In California from 1932 to 1952, Gary increased from only 81
instances to the ninth most popular boy's name in the state. But in
1984, Gary was absent from the list of the top 100 names.
   As families become more loose-knit, parents who normally would
name children after uncles and aunts may be looking to screen and
sports celebrities for inspiration, the professor theorizes.
   For instance, he says the recent popularity of the name Ashley
might have been inspired by the spread of Laura Ashley women's
clothes stores _ or by Ashley Abbott, a character on the soap
opera, ``The Young and the Restless.''

<HEAD>Civil Rights Forces Remain Cool To Lucas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Lucas is making little headway in
winning support from civil rights leaders and black Americans in
his quest for confirmation as the nation's chief civil rights
enforcer.
   ``You're not likely to see a groundswell of black people coming
out for Mr. Lucas,'' says Althea Simmons, director and chief
lobbyist of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People.
   All but a smattering of civil rights leaders oppose Lucas or
have withdrawn early support as the Senate Judiciary Committee
nears a vote Tuesday on the black former sheriff who switched
parties in 1986 and became the Republican candidate for governor of
Michigan.
   The Bush administration can probably count on seven of the eight
votes needed for a favorable recommendation from the committee
Tuesday.
   And Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., still undeclared, appears able
to send the 61-year-old Lucas to the Senate floor with the panel's
blessing.
   Even if the committee rebuffs Lucas, the fight is likely to
reach the floor in the long run and be settled by the full Senate.
   As the showdown nears, Lucas stands less at odds with the civil
rights community than the post's last occupant, William Bradford
Reynolds. But that is about the best that can be said of the
relationship.
   That represents a change because civil rights forces initially
appeared divided over the nomination.
   An early supporter, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., introduced Lucas
before the committee two weeks ago and then returned the next day
to withdraw it, saying he was dismayed by the nominee's answers to
questions from the panel.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson also withdrew his early support and is
now among the Lucas detractors.
   Both defections came after a judiciary hearing July 19 at which
Lucas said it was too early to assess the impact of recent Supreme
Court decisions limiting the scope of laws to combat job bias and
establish minority set-asides in public works projects.
   At the session, he appeared uncertain about such matters as the
difference between ``de jure'' segregation that is based in law and
``de facto'' segregation that exists without any legal basis.
   NAACP lobbyist Simmons said her group was inundated by calls
from black viewers around the country who had seen the hearing via
the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network (C-SPAN) and were
unimpressed by Lucas.
   Civil rights leaders have narrowed their attack to one point.
They say he simply lacks the experience to do the job. He has never
tried a case, filed a brief or handled an appeal.
   ``It's as if I had a medical degree but didn't practice medicine
and were named to head a team of brain surgeons,'' Elaine Jones of
the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund told the committee.
   They say attacking Lucas on his lack of experience is far
preferable to following the lead of Judiciary Committee Democrats
who have questions about the nominee's passion for the cause of
civil rights.
   ``Passion is a different thing to different people,'' NAACP
lobbyist Simmons said later. ``It is the kind of thing that is not
quantifiable. How do you know he lacks passion? But you do know
that he has never tried a case.''
   Lucas has received backing from a handful of civil rights
activists around the country as well as black law enforcement
officials.
   Among well known civil rights leaders, though, only the Rev.
Joseph Lowery of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference has
rallied to Lucas.
   ``This is not the place to throw down the gauntlet with Mr.
Bush,'' Lowery said. ``It is not a lifetime appointment. It is not
the place were we have gotten our civil rights. We have gotten our
civil rights in the streets and in the Supreme Court and in the
Congress.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, Lucas has a record of supporting
affirmative action in his position as county executive and sheriff,
both for minors and women,'' Lowery said.
   He shrugged off the complaints of other civil rights leaders
that Lucas was less than zealous about civil rights before the
committee.
   ``I didn't expect him to contradict the administration's
position,'' Lowery said. ``I didn't expect him to say, unlike my
boss, Mr. Bush, and unlike my boss, Mr. Thornburgh. I don't think
he's crazy.''
   Jackson, however, expressed concern about Lucas remarks that it
was too early to assess the impact of the decisions and his
suggestion to the committee that the nation is headed in the right
direction on civil rights.
   ``Today, racial discrimination is defended not by dogs and hoses
but by onerous burdens of proof, severe statutes of limitations,
discovery restrictions and procedural trickery,'' Jackson said in a
June 24 letter to Biden.

<TEXT>
   Guatemala's young democracy is on a rough
road as it heads toward a presidential campaign, with strikes, coup
jitters, businesses balking at higher taxes and rebel and vigilante
groups on the prowl.
   More than 50,000 government employees have walked off the job,
demanding raises that President Vinicio Cerezo will not _ or dares
not _ grant them.
   The strike has trapped Cerezo between the conservative
privileged sectors and demands that have surged since democracy in
1986.
   His inauguration that year ended more than 30 years of
military-dominated rule. But the campaign to replace him at the end
of his five-year term is expected to bring an increase in the
violence that has been the curse of this Ohio-sized nation of 9
million. By law, Cerezo cannot run again.
   Affluent businessmen are reported doubling and tripling
bodyguards in anticipation of kidnappings and other violence
leading up to the election, expected in the fall of next year.
   Dozens of bombs or bomb scares have hit the capital since July
19, when the president went on national television to defy the
strikers.
   The president always packs a pistol.
   ``After he puts on his tie, he puts on his gun,'' said
presidential spokeswoman Claudia Arenas.
   Cerezo, a man with a legendary social life whose government has
been described kindly as ``improvised'' or less kindly as
``anarchic,'' has been firm in his ``no'' to demands for raises.
   He insists that by raising salaries, the government, which has
one of the lowest tax bases in the hemisphere, would unleash
crippling inflation.
   Cerezo has not forgotten what happened when he supported a
modest tax hike early in his term. The business sector went on
strike and rightists waged what Defense Minister Hector Gramajo
later called a ``large-scale'' pro-coup campaign.
   Coup attempts came in May 1988 and on May 9 of this year.
Gramajo is credited with thwarting both attempts by holding the
bulk of the armed forces in line.
   The teachers began walking out in early June. On July 13,
thousands of strikers blockaded Congress during a ceremony honoring
the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. The diplomatic
corps, the Cabinet and the Congress were trapped for hours.
   Union leaders say teachers were promised a raise this year but
haven't received it despite rising prices. Two raises last year
brought the starting salary to about $125 a month, with top scale
at $250 _ not bad by Guatemalan standards. The minimum wage is less
than $60 a month.
   Private sector unions, which earn less than the teachers,
demonstrated in sympathy with government workers July 26.
   ``If there is irresponsibility, if there is radicalization, if
there is polarization, it could be risky,'' said Ms. Arenas.
   The president insists the strike is pure politics and warned it
could backfire by costing ``democratic political parties'' the
chance to replace him when he steps down Jan. 14, 1991.
   ``You are being manipulated'' by the extreme right and the
extreme left, he told strikers in a nationwide television and radio
address July 19.
   As the broadcast began, anonymous saboteurs bombed Channel 7's
transmission tower, knocking the private station off the air.
   With all its failings, the Cerezo administration can and does
regard the survival of civil liberties outlined in the constitution
as its major achievement. That constitution, which came into force
in January 1986, gave public employees the right to strike.
   ``Before, the strikers probably would have been shot,'' said
Angel Alfredo Figueroa, deputy attorney general for human rights.
   In the fight for the nomination inside the majority Christian
Democrats, Cerezo is backing party general secretary Alfonso
Cabrera, a close friend.
   The other leading contender is party patriarch Rene de Leon, who
supporters hope can clean up the party's corruption-tarnished image.
   Twenty other political parties are registered.
   The Cerezo administration denies rumors Cabrera is linked to
narcotics traffic, a major problem in Guatemala. U.S. officials say
they have no evidence Cabrera is tied to drug trafficking but would
not comment on other corruption charges.
   Civilian government has helped Guatemala recover some of the
respectability it lost in the bloodiest days of military repression
and it has helped preserve a measure of civil liberty, but it
hasn't brought stability.
   The military dominates the countryside where 70 percent of
Guatemalans live, most under conditions that have changed little
since the Spanish Conquest.
   The 27-year-old leftist insurgency continues in the remote
mountains and jungles, even though the rebel force has dwindled to
fewer than 2,000 fighters.
   Cerezo clearly feels insecure.
   In June, he retreated to the presidential farm for 10 days,
emerging to describe an assassination plot involving an improbable
combination of Cubans, Libyans and rightists.
   High walls topped by barbed wire protect the homes of the
wealthy few who control the vast majority of Guatemala's resources.
So-called ``civil defense'' patrols dispense rough justice among
the rural, Indian poor.
   The Mutual Support Group, a human rights organization, said
there were about 800 political murders last year, and Amnesty
International's latest report says the army and police continue to
run death squads.

<TEXT>
   Fashion was a high-style spectacle last week as
couture designers unveiled their extravagant clothes in opulent
fabrics for winter of 1989-90.
   The idea this season is sexy rather than power dressing.
   Most couturiers have backed off from the big padded shoulder
after Christian Lacroix led the way two seasons ago. But Saint
Laurent and Givenchy still believe that padding gives the right
shape to suit jackets.
   Skirt lengths are irrelevant. The many knee-baring skirts still
look appealing for those with good legs, especially when the skirts
are given the tulip-wrap treatment. But some longer lengths looked
fine too, at influential houses like Saint Laurent and Chanel.
   There was a lot of ``retro'' around, not least at the house of
Dior, where the Italian designer, Gianfranco Ferre, took a look at
the first Dior New Look of 1947 and whipped up his own version.
   Although a newcomer to the Paris shows, Ferre won the season's
top couture prize, the Golden Thimble, for his beautifully
constructed clothes that had dashes of daring, such as the sequined
chevron-tweed suits.
   Ferre's Dior evening wear showed huge organza bows at the neck,
the strapless and wasp-waisted dresses with stiffened tulle
underskirts, plus ornamental bouquets of lilies of the valley.
   Some customers didn't buy all of Ferre's ideas. A Texan who has
her own mannequin for fittings at Dior said, ``No way I'd buy those
complicated clothes. They're too bulky for packing.''
   Another Italian, Gianni Versace, had the last word of the week,
placing his ``atelier'' couture models on headless mannequins in
the Jacquemart-Andre Museum. The party was attended by several
celebrities, including Joan Collins, dressed in form-fitting ruby
satin, Marisa Berenson in a bead-embroidered Versace tunic and
Isabelle Huppert in an easy-fitted beige silk dress.
   Christian Lacroix's offhand mixing of fabrics in his short
fitted suits and big accessories showed him in good form, though
some observers thought this was not his best collection.
   Saint Laurent's fans were glad to know that he kept his daytime
wear strictly conservative, with a sharply-tailored silhouette,
long or bolero jackets with padded shoulders, a few blousons and
several flowing capes.
   Most of Saint Laurent's evening wear had a true touch of magic.
His flower-shaped short evening dresses in brocade lames were truly
fabulous, with their stiffened wing-like collars and skirt wraps.
   Karl Lagerfeld's riding jacket for Chanel stole the show.
   The most memorable outfit in this curvaceous line was the
decollete off-the-shoulder outsized houndstooth-check jacket, worn
with a wispy chiffon skirt.
   Chanel and virtually everyone else in Paris showed fabulous lame
``damasked'' fabrics and brocades, along with frothy dollops of
Chantilly lace and embroidered tulle, satin and chiffon. But rich
velvets and taffetas and faille turned up as well.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer interpreted evening wear as a dazzling magic
carpet of shimmering fabrics in fitted short suits, long gowns and
tunics with pants for a thousand and one nights of rich revelry on
the exotic road to India.
   The hot new color to remember this fall will be chocolate _
dark, milky or pinkish like cinnamon. And it gets mixed in with
shades like coral or aqua to lighten things up. Pearly grays at
Dior looked superb.
   While it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce and
show most these couture collections _ and only a few women can
afford the outfits costing well upwards of $10,000 _ couture is
considered useful.
   The showy clothes serve as prototypes for luxury ready-to-wear,
and they give a house and its designer an image and reputation to
fuel sales of everything from accessories to makeup and perfume.

   When Terry Freiermuth began talking
to his neighbors about the oily patches dotting the soil in the
trailer park where he lives, he couldn't find many who shared his
worries.
   But the 29-year-old truck mechanic knew what he was talking
about. He grew up four miles away at Love Canal, the neighborhood
the government declared a national disaster area a decade ago
because of chemical pollution.
   ``People thought I was crazy,'' Freiermuth said. ``But I know
something about chemicals. ... It's the same damn thing all over
again.''
   Last week, federal officials said industrial chemicals in the
soil and groundwater under the Forest Glen mobile home park pose a
significant environmental health threat to the 51 families living
there. They urged people to move away.
   ``There is continuous danger to you and your children if you
stay,'' Robert Salkie, of the Environmental Protection Agency, told
a gathering of residents.
   Authorities think the ground on which the trailer park was built
was once a chemical dump. EPA enforcement official David Payne said
several companies are under investigation, including Occidental
Chemical Corp., which a federal judge earlier this year ruled
partly responsible for Love Canal contamination.
   Forest Glen residents have reported health problems a lot like
those at Love Canal: allergies, unexplained rashes, headaches and
fears as yet unproven, of higher-than-normal rates of cancer and
other serious illness.
   Despite the doubts of his neighbors, Freiermuth, who has lived
in Forest Glen for nine years, has been pestering federal officials
about his fears since spring 1987.
   He ordered his daughters, ages 4 and 8, to play on the sidewalk,
to stay away from the grass and dirt. He warned them against
playing with the taffy-like clumps of soil.
   ``I figured there's nothing anybody can do for me after all
these years,'' Freiermuth said. ``But I hope it's not too late for
my kids.''
   He blames the chemicals for his youngest child's eczema, a skin
condition. And he worries about Kathy, his wife, who is pregnant.
   The five contaminants found in Forest Glen are aniline,
phenothiazine, benzothiazole, mercaptobenzothiazole and
polyaromatic hydrocarbons, said David Payne, an EPA enforcement
official. They apparently were byproducts from the manufacture of
other chemicals, he said, adding that exposure to aniline causes
cancer.
   As with Love Canal, EPA officials suspect the contamination came
from some of the many chemical companies attracted to the area by
cheap hydroelectric power produced from the rushing waters of the
Niagara River.
   That was the story at Love Canal, where chemicals dumped in an
abandoned waterway project in the 1940s and 1950s began seeping
into cellars and backyards in the 1960s, causing illness.
   Some 1,030 familes evacuated a 10-block area around Love Canal
in 1978 and 1979. Today the neighborhood is a ghost town, except
for the cleanup workers in rubber suits and the few residents who
chose to remain.
   Even though Freiermuth wasn't the only former Love Canal
resident to move to Forest Glen, he was one of the few who didn't
quietly accept the situation. ``Part of it is that we came here to
forget about Love Canal,'' said Freiermuth, a small, serious man
with unruly blond hair and bushy sideburns. ``But a lot of people
figure that the chemicals are everywhere in this town.''
   Federal officials have promised to help residents of Forest
Glen. The EPA's Salkie said the neighborhood will become ``a model
site, to show how Superfund can work.''
   The residents aren't cooperating, though. Most of them,
including the Freiermuths, have refused the government's offer to
move to temporary homes while the site is placed on a priority list
for federal clean-up.
   ``We don't want to wait months in an apartment and then have to
move again,'' Freiermuth said. ``That's too disruptive. ... Why
can't they just declare the site a federal emergency and buy us out
like they did in Love Canal?''

<HEAD>Extremists Threaten To Kill Higgins Unless Israel Frees Cleric</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE that no photo received, Iranian condemnation

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Shiite Moslem captors of U.S. Marine
Col. William R. Higgins threatened Sunday to hang him within 24
hours if Israel fails to free the pro-Iranian fundamentalist cleric
it abducted from Lebanon.
   ``This will be our first response to the stupid Israeli
aggression and the flagrant American support that proves U.S.
complicity in the crime,'' said a statement issued by the
underground Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.
   ``We shall carry out the death sentence handed down against
proven spy Higgins by hanging him at exactly 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT)
Monday if Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid and his two brethren have not
been freed by then,'' said the typewritten Arabic statement.
   It was delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut two days
after helicopter-borne Israeli commandoes kidnapped Obeid, 33, and
two colleagues from Obeid's home in a southern Lebanese village and
flew them to Israel.
   The statement was not accompanied by a picture of Higgins, the
usual confirmation of authenticity. But the statement appeared to
have been typed on the same machine and the same paper as earlier
statements. Previous statements had photographs of Higgins or of
his military identification card.
   After the commando raid Friday, some speculated that Israel
would try to swap Obeid and his colleagues for Higgins or for three
Israeli soldiers believed to be held in Lebanon since 1986 by
Obeid's group or its affiliates.
   Obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in south Lebanon. Obeid has denied any
links to the group.
   Hezbollah is widely believed to be the umbrella for Shiite
extremist factions, including the Oppressed on Earth, that are
holding most of the 17 Western hostages in Lebanon. Nine of the
hostages are Americans.
   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini maintained that Iran's 1979
Islamic Revolution was carried out for the mostazafin, or oppressed.
   On Saturday, Israeli leaders dismissed criticism of the
abduction and said Obeid led a ``fanatical'' group that had
launched terrorist attacks on Israel.
   On Friday, President Bush said he could not condone the commando
raid and that he did not know if it would help efforts to free
Higgins.
   In Tehran on Sunday, Iranian Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Montashemi told reporters that Islamic groups worldwide will
retaliate against the United States and Israel for the abduction of
Obeid.
   The Oppressed on Earth group claimed responsibility for
abducting Higgins, a decorated Vietnam veteran, near south
Lebanon's port city of Tyre on Feb. 17, 1988. They charged he was a
spy for the CIA.
   Higgins, 44, of Danville, Ky., served as head of a 76-member
observer group attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon.
   In a statement issued Dec. 12, 1988, the Oppressed on Earth said
it sentenced Higgins to death after ``he had made full confessions
about his espionage activities.'' That statement said Higgins had
been handed ``to those responsible in the organization ... to
execute this just verdict.''
   Of the 17 Western hostages, the longest held is Terry A.
Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press.
   He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   A judge has ruled against a doctor who was
the first prosecuted under a federal law against ``patient
dumping.''
   Dr. Michael Burditt, who ordered an uninsured pregnant woman who
was about to give birth to be transferred to another hospital 160
miles away, faces a $20,000 fine, Donald P. Wilcox, attorney for
the Texas Medical Association, said Saturday.
   The patient dumping law, which was part of the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, forbids hospitals to
turn away patients needing emergency care or who are in active
labor.
   Burditt, who was off-duty at the time, made the decision as
chief of the obstetrical department at DeTar Hospital in Victoria.
   The case arose when Rosa Rivera _ poor and about to give birth
to her sixth child _ showed up at DeTar Hospital late on the
afternoon of Dec. 5, 1986.
   When a nurse called Burditt and told him Mrs. Rivera's blood
pressure was 210 over 130, he said she ``sounds like more than I
can handle.'' The blood pressure reading was higher than any he had
seen in 12 years of delivering babies.
   Burditt ordered Mrs. Rivera to be taken to John Sealy Hospital
in Galveston, 160 miles away. But the nurse and her supervisor were
concerned about the federal law.
   After some heated words between the doctor and the nurses, Mrs.
Rivera left the hospital in an ambulance. She gave birth to a
healthy baby boy a half-hour later, in the ambulance by the side of
the road.
   DeTar, which nearly lost its eligibility for Medicare funding,
paid a $5,000 fine after an investigation by the Dallas regional
office of the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Burditt refused to pay a $25,000 fine assessed against him and
the Texas and American medical associations took his side.
   Wilcox said the Health and Human Services administrative law
judge, Charles E. Stratton, lowered the fine because of ``some
mitigating factors.''
   Since the incident, Burditt has improved the transfer network
system and has helped set up an obstetric clinic to make prenatal
care more accessible for indigent patients, Wilcox said.
   A woman who identified herself as Burditt's wife said he would
have no comment until Monday. She also said that he was no longer
the chief of the hospital's obstetrical department but still
practices there.

   The marriage of John Saffelo and Clara
Deets went down the tubes in a happy way. The couple took the
matrimonial plunge at a water park.
   The bride wore a white one-piece bathing suit and a flowing veil
in the ceremony Saturday at the Raging Waters amusement park. The
groom sported black swim trunks with white piping, a back bow tie
and black and white cuffs _ but nothing else.
   Saffello, 23, and Ms. Deets, 20, said their ``I dos'' at the top
of a slide, then plunged together down the spiraling 100-foot
tunnels of ``The Bermuda Triangle'' attraction at the park in

   Welz, a 9{-year-old police dog that
helped officers make more than 1,000 arrests, has retired.
   Two dozen officers came to the German shepherd's retirement
party Wednesday at a pizza parlor. Welz got a plaque from the Los
Angeles Police Department's anti-gang unit, thanking him for
sniffing out a homicide suspect May 16 in what turned out to be his
last arrest.
   But the K-9 veteran seemed more interested in a piece of pizza
crust than in his award.
   Welz probably could have worked for another two years, but his
handler, Sgt. John W. Bell, is being promoted out of the K-9 unit
at the Inglewood Police Department.
   ``He's getting retired simply because I'm getting old,'' Bell
quipped.
   Welz was stabbed, clubbed and kicked during his career but
remained fearless, his handler said. Like many loyal workers,
retirement was a bit of a let-down.
   ``For the first two weeks he lay by the front door and never
left it until I got home,'' Bell said. ``Now when I leave he just
whines. ... He's starting to adjust now.''

<TEXT>
   For much of its 100 years, California's
Orange County has represented a golden spot in a golden state:
cheap, plentiful land that sprouted first farms, then housing
tracts. It was a suburban sidekick to Los Angeles and a playland
that Mickey Mouse called home.
   But as the county of more than 2.2 million residents prepares to
mark its centennial Tuesday, experts say it has already rocketed
into the future as a metropolitan center where jobs _ not its
now-costly land _ are the lure, and where urban woes are
inescapable.
   ``Orange County has made the transition from being a suburb to
being a center of commerce,'' said Mark Baldassare, professor of
sociology at the University of California, Irvine. ``In the next
100 years, I expect it will become more like a dense urban region.''
   Jammed freeways and polluted air are the baggage carried by
growth, and won't be easily banished, he said. High-priced housing
also will remain part of the landscape.
   ``People will be coming here because it's a land of economic
opportunity, not some kind of utopia,'' Baldassare said.
   Only recently have people realized that the dream of an
uncrowded region, with homes affordable to all, has slipped away.
   It's within the last three years that surveys have found traffic
consistently named the county's No. 1 problem, said Tom Fortune,
spokesman for the Orange County Transportation Commission.
   Home prices in Orange County have soared beyond the rest of
costly California: The median home price in June was $251,674,
compared with $200,445 statewide, according to the California Board
of Realtors. That compares to a median price of $93,200 nationwide.
   ``It's as if the entire coast of Southern California is becoming
one mega-Manhattan, where only the wealthy can afford to live,''
said Baldassare.
   But the high cost of living has not stopped corporations,
foreign and domestic, from locating in Orange County, say
Baldassare and Bob Dunham, president of Newport Economics Group, a
Newport Beach, Calif.-based market research firm.
   Orange County, known to many Americans as the home of
Disneyland, already is a major player in the Pacific Rim economy,
attracting big Japanese manufacturers such as Toshiba and
Panasonic, said Dunham.
   Baldassare agreed that foreign investment will grow, and said
the county will continue to attract the aerospace and other
high-tech corporations like those that have set up shop in such new
developments as the Irvine Spectrum.
   In Irvine and other cities such as Costa Mesa, glossy high-rises
stand in strange proximity to reminders of Orange County's agrarian
past: patches of farmland that, for now, have escaped the bulldozer.
   Wes Kirkpatrick, 64, is one of the last cowboys still herding
cattle on dwindling Orange County ranchland.
   Kirkpatrick, who came to California from Larimer County, Colo.,
nearly 20 years ago, knows that the sliver of the old West, in the
canyon above the popular resort of Laguna Beach, will inevitably
vanish.
   ``It's a shame to see it go, especially for someone like me
raised on open country,'' Kirkpatrick said. ``But to a lot of
people it won't mean a thing.''
   Like the grazing land, the 61,000 acres of fragrant orange
trees, strawberry fields and orchards scattered throughout the
county seem like souvenirs of a past era. In the 1930s, 86 percent
of the county's 500,000-plus acres was given over to farming and
ranching.
   It was agriculture that brought the county's first boom. Efforts
at promoting farmland in the area surged in 1869, when the
completion of the transcontinental railroad opened the West for
expansion.
   By 1889, voters decided to sever the region from Los Angeles
County and form the County of Orange. The census the next year
counted 13,589 residents.
   It was the post-World War II search for affordable housing that
produced the most massive wave of immigrants.
   Orange County's 1950 population was 220,000. By 1960, it had
swelled to 704,000 residents, an increase of 220 percent in a
county that is roughly three-quarters the size of Rhode Island.
   The county's newcomers have maintained the primarily white,
middle-class profile that forecasters expect to persist, along with
a reputation for political conservatism.
   Once a bedroom community to Los Angeles, Orange County now finds
itself an urban center calling on less-developed inland counties
such as Riverside and San Bernardino to provide housing.

<HEAD>Congress Sorting Through Budget Bills As Recess Nears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Congress characteristically lagging behind
schedule enters its last week before summer recess ready to race
through bills mapping how the government will spend nearly half its
$1.17 trillion budget next year.
   The House has lofty plans, hoping to complete the last seven of
the 13 annual appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 by Friday.
   The Senate, which by law can act on spending measures only after
receiving them from the House, might consider two appropriations
bills late in the week. It is likely to spend much of the rest of
its time trying to complete work on the $295 billion defense
authorization bill for next year.
   By law, Congress was supposed to have completed action on all
tax and deficit-reduction legislation by June 15, and the House was
to finish all 13 appropriations measures by June 30. The new fiscal
year begins Oct. 1.
   As usual, those dates have come and gone without the work being
done. The law provides no consequences for missing the deadlines,
and lawmakers will begin their four-week holiday on Aug. 5 with a
large pile of budget work awaiting their return.
   The House Ways and Means and the Senate Finance committees have
yet to decide how to raise $5.3 billion in new tax receipts for
next year called for in the congressional budget.
   Democrats are continuing to resist a capital gains tax cut that
President Bush is pressing, and Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., has been talking with administration
officials in a search of a compromise.
   ``I don't know how long the discussion is going to continue,''
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Friday.
   Spending work also is going slowly. The two chambers both have
approved only three of the 13 appropriations bills, and have yet to
work out compromise versions of any of them that can be sent to
Bush for his signature.
   The House will consider measures providing $1.6 billion for the
legislative branch and $8.7 billion for military construction on
Monday, and $5.8 billion for the Commerce, Justice and State
departments on Tuesday.
   On Wednesday it debates legislation providing $500 million for
the District of Columbia and $155 billion for the departments of
Labor, Health and Human Services and Education.
   An $11.9 billion transportation bill will be considered
Thursday, and the biggest of the spending bills _ a measure
providing $305 billion for defense spending _ will be considered
Friday.
   The Senate could consider a measure for the Treasury and Postal
Service expected to be about $18 billion, and a bill providing
about $1.6 billion for Congress' own operations.
   Both chambers also plan to pass a bill that will permit the
government to continue borrowing money so it can finance its
operations. The legal debt limit of $2.8 trillion should be
surpassed sometime in August, and congressional leaders hope to
pass legislation that would provide enough money to permit
borrowing through October.
   Such must-pass legislation often bogs down, however, because it
attracts unrelated, controversial amendments. Leaders are trying to
secure agreements to avoid that.
   The Senate on Monday resumes work on the defense authorization
bill, a measure that creates the programs that are then paid for by
appropriations.
   The House completed its version of the bill on Thursday, cutting
B-2 Stealth bomber spending, slashing the Star Wars program and
taking other liberties with Bush's defense priorities. Senate
leaders are trying to fashion a measure more closely resembling
White House preferences.
   Bush's nomination of William Lucas as the nation's chief civil
rights enforcer comes up in the Senate Judiciary Committee on
Tuesday.
   Many civil rights groups oppose Lucas, saying he lacks
experience. Republicans say the 61-year-old former Wayne County,
Mich., sheriff, who is black, has learned his lessons the hard way
in his climb from dishwasher to elected official.
   In the spotlight is undeclared Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., whose
vote could put Lucas over the top. Even if the Judiciary Committee
withholds its recommendation, however, the nomination is likely to
end up under debate on the Senate floor through an alternate route.
   Votes on a compromise savings and loan bailout bill also are
planned next week. The measure, worked out by negotiators from the
House and Senate last week, would cost $166 billion.
   Fireworks could still be touched off because the package ignores
Bush's proposal to remove $50 billion of the spending from the
budget, which would make the deficit appear smaller. Senate
Republicans could still block the plan.

<HEAD>Atlantic City's Reputation Hinders Its Future, Observers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE A. VENEZIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city's reputation for corruption
weakens its potential for economic and social growth, most
observers agree in the wake of the latest scandal.
   Last week's arrest of Mayor James Usry, six other city officials
and several local business people was the fourth time out of six
previous city administrations that the resort's leaders have been
charged with corruption.
   Usry was elected five years ago as a reformist candidate after
his predecessor was implicated in an influence-peddling scandal and
lost a recall election.
   Once again, residents and business owners are embarrassed.
Albert A. Marks Jr., a long-time civic leader and former director
of the Miss America Pageant, remembers past attempts to reform the
resort's government.
   Changes are thwarted by provincial attitudes, he said.
   ``Atlantic City really needs help from the outside, but everyone
in Atlantic City has a chip on their shoulder for the people who
move to the suburbs,'' Marks said. ``Their attitude is, `We are
alone to ourselves.'
   ``A regional government would be ideal, but it's probably not
going to happen,'' he said. ``So, it's going to take a mayoral
candidate whose qualifications are so beyond anybody who has ever
run before, and it's going to take a very aggressive city manager
who is really experienced in running a hundred-million dollar
business with billions of dollars in assets.''
   The city's 11 casinos mostly report to state gaming regulators,
but in matters of zoning and planning, the gaming halls must endure
a city system often overwhelmed by the mammoth projects. Usry has
often been accused of being an incompetent administrator.
   In a statement issued by the Casino Association of New Jersey,
the casinos suggested changes in government must be made.
   Martin Danzinger, a former member of the state Casino Control
Commission, said the city's deteriorated condition and its
administrators' reputations probably deter potential investors.
   In 1976, when gambling was legalized, gaming companies first
rushed to Atlantic City ``because it was new,'' he said.
   ``Now, investors notice that the city has failed to develop many
aspects of the schools, transportation and other social services,''
Danzinger said. ``The expansion of the airport and the talk of a
new convention center _ those are still being discussed after 10
years.
   ``That all negates interest by investors. They say they have
better places to throw their money,'' he said.
   Atlantic City has a lot going for it, geographically, observers
say: a temperate seaside location just two hours away from the
major metropolitan areas of New York and Philadelphia.
   A dying city injected with millions of dollars in new tax
revenues, such as Atlantic City, could be reborn, Danzinger said.
Hartford, Pittsburgh and Baltimore are just some examples of cities
that have successfully put on a new face.
   ``In those places, cities and governments work hand in hand,''
he said. ``When I pass through Atlantic City, much of what I see
looks exactly the way it did 10 years ago, and that's largely the
fault of city government.''
   But James Hughes, a professor of urban policy and planning at
Rutgers University, said the city suffers because ``the casinos
internalize operations. Local merchants are certainly hurt.''
   Casino money ``bypassed the poor of the city,'' said Hughes,
co-author of a 1983 book titled ``The Atlantic City Gamble,'' a
critical look at what legalized gambling did for the decaying
resort.
   Usry and 13 others were charged Thursday with bribery,
conspiracy, influence peddling, official misconduct and other
counts resulting primarily from an attempt to gain control of a
lucrative Boardwalk electric cart business and an airport gift shop
franchise.
   The case now goes before a state grand jury. In the meantime,
Usry and the others can still hold office.
   Within hours after Usry's arrest, ``state takeover'' was on the
minds of many. Legislation for an Atlantic City ``super agency''
has been proposed before, but never took off.
   Marks believes the state must take over Atlantic City ``at least
on an interim basis, to eliminate what I perceive will develop into
a chaotic situation. It will psychologically calm things down.''

   The White House, reacting to the threat by
Shiite Moslems to kill U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,
warned on Sunday that the kidnappers will be held ``fully
responsible'' for the safety of Higgins and other American hostages.
   The White House released the terse statement after the captors
of Higgins threatened to hang him within 24 hours if Israel fails
to free the pro-Iranian fundamentalist cleric who was abducted from
Lebanon.
   In a statement read by spokeswoman Alixe Glen, the White House
said:
   ``We hold the kidnappers of American hostages fully responsible
for their safety. We expect those who have influence with the
hostage holders to do everything possible to ensure that no harm
comes to those hostages or other Americans.''
   In Paris, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
Secretary of State James A. Baker III discussed Higgins' situation
earlier Sunday at a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar. Both men are in Paris attending a 19-nation
conference on Cambodia.
   ``It is outrageous and uncivilized that he should have been
taken hostage in the first place,'' Ms. Tutwiler said of Higgins.
``It is equally outrageous to threaten to kill him.''
   She called the threat ``an affront to the entire civilized
community.''
   The threat to hang Higgins came from the underground
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, which delivered a message
to a Western news agency in Beirut on Sunday. The threat came two
days after helicopter-borne Israeli commandoes kidnapped Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid, 33, and two colleagues from Obeid's home in
south Lebanese village and flew him to Israel.
   The threat, typed in Arabic, said:
   ``This will be our first response to the stupid Israeli
aggression and the flagrant American support that proves U.S.
complicity in the crime.''
   ``We shall execute by hanging the death sentence handed down
against proven spy Higgins at exactly 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) Monday if
Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid and his two brethren have not been freed by
then.''

   The Rolling Stones won't have to bypass
Philadephia after all, a spokesman said, despite the closing for
safety reasons of a stadium where the legendary rock group was
scheduled to play Sept. 21.
   The group, instead, will open its 29-city North American tour
here sometime in August, Alan C. Kessler said Friday.
   The group will play at Veterans Stadium, appearing in
Philadelphia at least three weeks earlier than planned, said
Kessler, an attorney for Electric Factory Concerts. Negotiations
are continuing on details and dates, he said.
   No city spokesman was available to confirm the booking Sunday, a
switchboard operator at City Hall said.
   The Stones on July 11 announced their tour schedule, which
included an opening in Buffalo on Sept. 1 and the stop at John F.
Kennedy Stadium on Sept. 21. Two days later, Mayor W. Wilson Goode
ordered the closing of the aging Philadelphia stadium, former site
of the annual Army-Navy football game and dozens of giant rock
concerts.

former NBA All-Stars defeated a Taiwan squad 133-117.
   The former Los Angeles Lakers' star then ran around the court as

his basketball jersey for good after Sunday's game.
   ``I am giving up basketball,'' Abdul-Jabbar told a news

   Premier Lee Huan threw out the ball to open the game at Linkou
Stadium, about 25 miles west of Taipei. Basketball's popularity in

   Bruce Springsteen's attorneys have been
ordered to turn over all income tax records of the rock star's
employees to attorneys for two former workers who are suing him.
   Judge Florence Peskoe of Superior Court in Monmouth County told
the attorneys to comply with an earlier court order in a lawsuit in
which two former ``roadies'' for Springsteen claim they were
underpaid.
   Michael Batlan of Ocean Township and Douglas Sutphin of Long
Branch also claim they are owed thousands of dollars in overtime
from the ``Born in the U.S.A.'' tour in 1984 and 1985.
   Batlan quit in 1985 and Sutphin was fired that year. Both claim
they were full-time employees on call year round and should have
been paid at a rate slightly less than band members. Each made
about $50,000 a year working for Springsteen.
   Ms. Peskoe's order Friday was in response to a motion filed by
Stephen Schueler, attorney for the two men, to make Springsteen and
his organization, Thrill Hill Productions, comply with the previous
order and turn over financial records, including tax returns from
1973 to 1985.
   Ms. Peskoe gave Springsteen's attorneys 30 days to turn over the
records.

   Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, African music superstar and

Apollo Theater to benefit the defense fund of imprisoned American
soul icon James Brown.
   ``Without James Brown, many people wouldn't even know where
America was, man. For this, he gets six years. I want to politicize
him,'' the musician popularly known as Fela said Saturday in a
pre-concert interview.
   He referred to the six-year sentence the ``Godfather of Soul''
is serving in South Carolina on charges of aggravated assault and
failing to stop for a police officer. Fela was an opening act for
Brown concerts when the American singer toured Africa during the
1970s.
   Omnipresent cigarette in hand, trademark metal chains around his
neck, Fela raised both fists to kick off the first number: ``U.S.''
or ``Underground System.'' It lasted for one and a half hours.
   Fela ran for president of Nigeria in 1979.

   Actor Billy Dee Williams defended his association

that target blacks is overblown.
   ``I think people are getting a little ridiculous,'' Williams
said Friday after making a donation to the Special Olympics.
   ``When we don't know what to do we start picking at anything.
The whole focus should be not so much on the beer but on how you
lead your life,'' said Williams, a spokesman for Colt for several

   Black leaders in Detroit, citing studies showing more
alcohol-and tobacco-related health problems among blacks than among
whites, have been sharply critical of advertisements for those
products in the city. Wayne County Commissioner Alberta
Tinsley-Williams has proposed banning new billboards advertising
such products.
   ``I think a lot of people are overreacting,'' Williams said.
``You can't legislate morality.''

   Foreign ministers from the United States, the
Soviet Union and other countries opened an international conference
Sunday with a call for a comprehensive peace settlement in
Cambodia, but the warring parties stuck to their entrenched
positions.
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk repeated his
calls for a four-party interim government that would include the
widely detested Khmer Rouge.
   His chief rival, Prime Minister Hun Sen of the pro-Hanoi
Cambodian government, charged that Khmer Rouge participation would
only ``open the door for them to return to power or provoke a civil
war no one could limit or control.''
   The conference, aimed at bringing an end to Cambodia's
20-year-old conflict, opened with statements from leaders of 11 of
the 20 delegations, nearly all appealing for an end to the
Southeast Asian nation's trauma.
   ``The occupation should end. The violence should end. The
suffering should end,'' said Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
``We know the path to Cambodian internal reconciliation is likely
to be long and arduous. But today we take the first steps.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze called for a
cease-fire in Cambodia even before all the Vietnamese troops have
left, and for an international body to monitor the withdrawal.
   He also called for practical measures to stop outside military
assistance to all the warring groups.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France, the co-host of the
conference along with Indonesia, opened the meeting, declaring it
was ``now possible and urgent to bring an end to one of the most
murderous, unjust conflicts in history.''
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, ending a Khmer Rouge rule
during which hundreds of thousands of people died in execution
chambers and slave labor camps. Vietnam installed another communist
government in Phnom Penh.
   As the conference began, two Japanese Buddhist monks chanted
outside the turn-of-the-century International Conference Hall, a
block from the Arc de Triomphe. They banged drums and offered
prayers for the meeting's success.
   Hun Sen announced that only 26,000 Vietnamese troops remained in
his country and reiterated earlier promises that all would be out
by the end of September.
   Vietnam's current troop strength in Cambodia has been estimated
by Western analysts at 60,000 to 70,000.
   Sihanouk renewed his charges that Vietnamese soldiers and
colonialists would in stay in Cambodia, and he said the risk of his
country remaining a Vietnamese protectorate was greater than the
threat from the Khmer Rouge.
   The Paris conference is the first among all involved parties,
which include Sihanouk's three-party guerrilla coalition and its
chief arms supplier China, as well as the Hun Sen government,
Vietnam and it's main backer, Moscow.
   Echoing one of the points of general agreement among the
speakers, Baker said the Khmer Rouge ``should play no role in
Cambodia's future.''
   However, he said Washington was willing to support Sihanouk's
inclusion of the Khmer Rouge, one of the parties of his loose
coalition, in an interim arrangement. He further qualified the
position by saying the actual Khmer Rouge leaders responsible for
the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Cambodians could never be
allowed to return to power.
   ``The strength of our support for any Cambodian government,
however, will directly and inversely depend on the extent of Khmer
Rouge participation, if any, in that government,'' Baker said.
   Baker said an international monitoring body under U.N. auspices
should be set up to monitor the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops,
ensure interim stability and ensure free and fair general elections.
   No new proposals to end the conflict were presented by the 11
delegates who spoke on the opening day of the conference. Scheduled
to address the monthlong conference Monday were the representatives
of China, Vietnam, Japan and the Khmer Rouge.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar suggested a
fact-finding mission travel to Cambodia as soon as possible to lay
the groundwork for a monitoring body.
   Cambodian guerrillas said Vietnamese troops backed by artillery
fire have been trying to retake Khmer Rouge guerrilla positions in
western Cambodia near the Thai border.
   A report heard Sunday in Bangkok from guerrilla radio said the
attacks showed Vietnam ``was not withdrawing even an inch from the
border'' and did not want a peace settlement.
   The radio reported attacks recently on three areas of Battambang
province bordering Thailand's Prachinburi and Chantaburi provinces
_ south Sisophon, Sisophon-Phnum Malai and Pailin.
   According to Thai military officers, pro-Vietnamese forces have
intensified shelling of guerrilla positions in the past week.
   Officials said the attacks could be intended as a show of
strength during the Paris talks.

<HEAD>Chinese Executes Two, Sentences 12 Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men were executed and a dozen other people
were sentenced to prison terms in the central city of Wuhan for
violence during recent pro-democracy demonstrations, it was
reported Sunday.
   Yu Chunting and Guo Zhenghua were sentenced to death and
executed by shots to the back of their heads Saturday afternoon for
stealing firearms and ammunition and killing a pregnant woman and a
girl while committing a robbery, the official Xinhua News Agency
said.
   One other person was given a suspended death sentence, two were
sentenced to life in prison, and nine received varying sentences
for beating police and soldiers, attacking government buildings,
stealing guns and ammunition, damaging railway facilities and
public vehicles and killing people.
   The report did not give the names of the other people convicted
or say who had committed which crimes or exactly when they occurred.
   Wuhan and about a dozen other provincial cities were rocked by
violent protests during the seven-week pro-democracy movement that
began in April. Television reports from Wuhan showed people burning
buses.
   Several dozen executions are known to have taken place since the
student-led protests were crushed in Beijing June 3-4. The
authorities previously directly linked only 12 people to the
protests. Many Chinese believe the number is far higher.
   The official media have reported more than 2,060 arrests
nationwide in connection with the protests, according to Associated
Press count. In recent weeks, however, the government has stopped
publicizing arrests and executions, apparently in part ot avoid
international criticism.
   Thousands of arrests are believed to be taking place secretly
nationwide.
   In Hong Kong on Sunday, a factory worker from the northern
Chinese Shanxi province denounced the Beijing government at a rally
and told the audience he lied at the official ideological education
sessions he had to attend.
   ``I made up something at the study group. But privately we said
all the official speeches were rubbish. It's so hypocritical,''
said the worker who identified himself as Li.
   He made the remarks during a rally attended by about 500 people
at a downtown park to condemn Chinese authorities for the
suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Li, who arrived in early July, is scheduled to return to China
in September when his visitor's permit expires. He came alone,
leaving his wife and two children in Taiyuan, provincial capital of
Shanxi about 250 miles southwest of Beijing.
   He said he would not mind staying in Hong Kong but would not be
bothered if he had to go back. He requested a television crew not
film his face.
   Hong Kong, a British colony at the southern tip of China, will
be reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. China promised under a 1984
Sino-British Agreement to maintain Hong Kong's capitalist system
for 50 years after 1997.

<HEAD>Actor to Do 20 Hours Of Community Service in Videotape Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Rob Lowe will have some leeway in deciding
terms of 20 hours of community service he agreed to perform to
avoid criminal prosecution, a prosecutor said Sunday.
   District Attorney Lewis R. Slaton had been investigating whether
to charge Lowe in the videotaping of Jan Parsons, then 16, in a sex
scene with a woman in an Atlanta hotel room when Lowe was attending
the 1988 Democratic National Convention.
   Lowe, 25, is one of 2,600 people to participate in Georgia's
pretrial intervention program, which Slaton called an alternative
to prosecution for young, non-violent first offenders.
   ``He fit the description of the program and the fact that he
happened to be famous didn't work against him,'' Slaton said. ``If
he completes the program in the two years' time and there are no
other problems, he's cleared from prosecution.''
   Lowe and his father met with Slaton on Friday, almost a year
after the alleged incident.
   He remains the subject of a civil suit brought by Miss Parsons'
mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, who claims Lowe seduced her daughter.
   Lowe's Atlanta attorney, Edgar A. Neely III, said his client's
agreement is not an admission of guilt in the civil suit.
   ``This case is not the kind that you'd take to a grand jury
anyway,'' he said, adding that Lowe made ``an error in judgment,
not a criminal thing.''
   Initial reports on the agreement referred to two years of
community service and omitted the 20-hour requirment.
   Slaton said exact terms of the program will be worked out in the
next few weeks, but that Lowe basically is expected to visit about
20 schools in the Los Angeles area over the next two years to make
speeches on topics such as drugs and the law.
   ``He also has expressed some interest in some schools outside of
Los Angeles, so that's one of the details they'll work out,''
Slaton said. ``Then anytime he does something, makes a speech for
an hour or something, it will be tabulated here until he's done.''
   Slaton said Lowe is to be supervised by the Georgia Department
of Labor, which runs the program.
   The criminal charge of sexual exploitation of a minor, which
Lowe might have faced, carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in
prison and a $100,000 fine, Slaton said.
   Lowe stared in such movies as ``About Last Night...,'' ``St.
Elmo's Fire'' and ``Oxford Blues.''

<HEAD>Vietnam, U.S. Announce Agreement to Send Ex-Political Prisoners To
U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States and Vietnam on Sunday
announced an agreement for former political prisoners and their
relatives to be resettled in the United States, with the first
group of 3,000 expected to leave this year.
   A joint statement said the two sides hoped to begin by October
``a program for the resettlement in the United states of released
re-education center detainees and their close family members who
wish to emigrate to the United States.''
   The communists toppled the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government
in April 1975, and hundreds of thousands of people were put into
the camps of manual labor and political study because of their ties
with the old regime. Vietnam has said all but about 120 have been
freed.
   The U.S. government has sought a formal program for their
resettlement since 1982, but political bickering and other problems
barred progress.
   The agreement was reached in Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, in talks
last week between teams led by Vu Khoan, Vietnamese assistant
foreign minister, and Robert L. Funseth, U.S. senior deputy
assistant secretary of state.
   Funseth said the agreement ``starts healing the last big wound
remaining from the war, which is that these people who were clearly
associated with the United States have not been allowed to leave
Vietnam and be united with their relatives in the United States.''
   Funseth, speaking to reports in Bangkok on Sunday, said he also
requested that Vietnam free the remaining prisoners as soon as
possible.
   In the joint statement, the U.S. government said it will not
encourage resettled prisoners to engage in activities hostile to
Vietnam and said it opposed such activities.
   Vietnam says exiles have engaged in anti-communist agitation and
even organized armed forays into Vietnam to try to overthrow the
government.
   The statement said the program would be in addition to existing
programs for resettling Amerasians _ children of American fathers
and Vietnamese mothers _ and of other refugees and migrants under
the Orderly Departure Program.
   It said the two sides ``expressed hope that the first group of
3,000 persons for resettlement in the United States under this
agreement will depart Vietnam before the end of the year after
processing is completed.''
   The statement did not say how many people in all may eventually
leave Vietnam under the program.
   A U.S. source in Bangkok, speaking anonymously, said Washington
estimates about 100,000 Vietnamese sent to re-education camps are
among the 600,000 who have applied to emigrate to the United States.
   The Vietnamese estimate former inmates and their families number
550,000, he said.
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said in June that
94,000 re-education prisoners had been freed in the past decade.
   In August 1988, Hanoi suspended talks on resettlement to protest
U.S. refusal to consider diplomatic ties until Vietnam ends its
occupation of Cambodia. Hanoi agreed to resume talks during last
month's international conference on Indochinese refugees held in
Geneva.
   Cooperation on humanitarian issues is expected to improve
further after Vietnam withdraws from Cambodia. It has promised to
do so by the end of September.

   The following is the text of the
statement issued Sunday by the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth threatening to kill U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
if Israel did not release abducted Shiite Moslem cleric Abdul Karim
Obeid.
   It was translated from Arabic by The Associated Press.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In the Name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate,
   O sons of our Islamic nation,
   O free men and oppressed of the world,
   It appears that the Zionist government is persisting in its
terrorist and aggressive policy against Islam and the Moslems. A
screaming proof of this is the latest aggression carried out by the
army of the Israeli enemy in which struggler Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid was abducted along with two brethren. Another son of the town
of Jibchit also was killed.
   This big aggressive act will not deter us from continuing the
struggle and resistance to snip out the cancer planted in our
blessed land and chop off the hand of the arrogants headed by the
great Satan, America.
   If the sons of Zion and their American arrogant backers think
that such acts will force us to compromise or capitulate, they are
wrong and will always be wrong.
   We are the true Islamic nation of Mohammed, in whose flesh and
blood martyrdom has been mixed since Al-Hussein's Ashoura. We are
the nation of glorious Jihad (Holy War), in which Islam has bred
the spirit of confidence and insubordination to no one but almight
God.
   Today, after this cowardly operation, we declare that American
spy Col. Higgins' link to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has
been proven beyond a shred of doubt. He coordinated conspiratorial
efforts by the CIA and the Zionist enemy to hit at Moslem forces
and their struggle against Israel.
   We have announced that in a previous statement and emphasized
that he has been admitted into the circle of serious danger after
the death sentence that had been handed down against him.
Therefore, we reiterate today that we shall carry out by hanging
the death sentence handed down against proven spy Higgins at
exactly 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) Monday if Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and
his two brethren have not been freed by then.
   This will be our first response to the stupid Israeli aggression
and the flagrant American support that proves U.S. complicity in
the crime. Procrastination will be futile and so will be repentance
afterward.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Wins 94.5 Percent of Vote in Iran's Presidential Election</HEAD>
<HEAD>By ALEX EFTY</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper on Sunday cautioned Iranians not
to expect miracles from the new government of Hashemi Rafsanjani,
who was elected president in a landslide.
   Final results show that Rafsanjani, who has been the Parliament
speaker, captured 94.5 percent of the presidential vote Friday.
   Just hours after the final results were announced, the official
Iranian media reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze would arrive Monday on an official visit.
   Iran's relations with the West are strained, and Rafsanjani has
been looking to the Soviet Union to help rebuild industries that
were battered in Iran's eight-year war with Iraq.
   Constitutional amendments also approved Friday make the
presidency the most powerful post in the government. It should give
Rafsanjani more control over the government than any previous
president in the 10-year history of the Islamic republic.
   The radical Jomhuri Islami newspaper cautioned Sunday that
people shouldn't expect miracles to end soaring inflation, high
prices and widespread inflation.
   ``It would be wrong if some people were hoping that every
problem would be solved quickly once the new government takes
charge,'' the newspaper said in an editorial.
   Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi told a news conference
Sunday that the revamped constitution, which scraps the post of
prime minister, was approved by 97 percent of those casting ballots.
   The amendments are designed to eliminate rival power blocs that
have paralyzed decision-making for years and delayed economic and
social reforms.
   Despite reports of a low turnout, Mohtashemi said a record 70
percent of the country's eligible 24 million voters took part.
   He said Iranian security forces had blocked attempts to smuggle
in weapons and ammunition and arrested ``elements cooperating with
foreign agents'' but gave no further details.
   It was not immediately clear when Rafsanjani, a middle-ranking
cleric who emerged as Iran's most powerful politician after the
death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on June 3, would take over.
   President Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini as Iran's supreme
leader, is due to step down as president when his second four-year
term ends in October.
   But he is expected to hand over power earlier so that Rafsanjani
can start tackling the country's economic problems.
   Rafsanjani hopes to revitalize the sluggish Iranian economy by
encouraging private investment and adopting a more laissez-faire
approach.
   He is also expected to gradually rebuild relations with Western
countries, which were severely strained by Khomeini's decree that
British author Salman Rushdie should be killed for allegedly
blaspheming Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Mohtashemi said the Rushdie affair ``is not an impediment on our
side'' to better relations with the West, but said the religious
decree still stands.
   ``If the Western world wants to have relations with the Islamic
world, it must deliver him to the Islamic world so the decree can
be executed. Otherwise this will remain a wound in the relations
between the two worlds,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Sunday claimed
President Bush has offered no substance to back up his professed
commitment to civil rights.
   Jackson, interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' faulted
Bush for supporting recent Supreme Court rulings opposed by civil
rights leaders, for failing to strengthen the Civil Rights
Commission and for lacking a comprehensive plan to fight drugs.
   ``Reagan laid the tracks to set us back,'' Jackson said. ``So
far, Bush has put grease on those tracks and not any brakes.''
   He credited Bush for directing less antagonism toward civil
rights, but added: ``So far, no substance.''
   ``It's too early to grade him, but there are some bad papers,''
Jackson said. ``So far we are disappointed.''
   Jackson said Bush's nomination of a black lawyer, Republican
William Lucas, to serve as the Justice Department's chief civil
rights advocate was ``a sinister play on race.''
   Jackson said Lucas was unqualified for the position because he
lacks trial experience, but that there are other Republican
minorities who are suited to the job.
   ``We need a credible civil rights lawyer who we feel will argue
our case behind closed doors,'' Jackson said. ``How can you expect
someone to perform the ultimate surgery who has never faced a
patient? Mr. Lucas ... would be expected to preside over 200 civil
rights lawyers and he has never tried a case.''
   Jackson, who is moving his legal residence to Washington, again
sidestepped questions about whether he would run for mayor of the
District of Columbia in 1990.
   ``I have no plans to run for the mayor of D.C.,'' Jackson said.
``There is no race in D.C. this year, but I am a little closer to
the White House.''
   Asked about his aspirations for the presidency in 1992, Jackson
said, ``It's too early to make that decision, but based upon last
year's efforts I am encouraged.''

<HEAD>Newspaper: Turkish Sympathizer to Iran Planted Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Sunday that a Turk
sympathetic to Iranian radicals posed as an airport worker in
Frankfurt and planted the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103.
   The weekly Observer, a respected newspaper, said that on orders
from an Iranian diplomat, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command contacted Turks to plan the bombing that
killed 270 people on Dec. 21.
   The radical PFLP-GC has been a prime suspect in the bombing of
the Boeing 747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, while en route to New
York. It has denied involvement.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified Middle Eastern and official
Western intelligence sources.
   Police in Lockerbie, coordinating an international investigation
into the bombing, said they were unable to comment on the report.
   It quoted a U.S. official with ``close knowledge of the
inquiries into the bombing'' as saying, ``A very interesting and
potentially productive side of our investigation involves members
of the German Turkish groups. Our inquiries are beginning to point
to the involvement of Turkish fundamentalists.''
   It said, however, that German officials who questioned airport
workers after the bombing have ``refused to either support or
dismiss'' the Observer's account.
   The newspaper said five Turks involved in the plot worked or
posed as airport workers, two in maintenance, one in catering and
two in unspecified areas.
   One described as a young engineer planted the bomb in a suitcase
inside a cargo container, said the Observer. He left Germany for
Beirut shortly after the bombing, it said, without identifying the
man.
   In two articles, the newspaper said the plot grew out of
meetings between the PFLP-GC, Iranian diplomats and Revolutionary
Guards and a ``bewildering array of Arab extremists.''
   In a series of meetings in Beirut and Iran beginning July 12,
1988, the extremists conceived plans for a terrorist attack, the
paper said.
   It noted that nine days earlier, the United States missile
cruiser USS Vincennes had mistakenly shot down an Iranian passenger
jet, killing all 290 aboard.
   The newspaper said PFLP-GC leader Ahmed Jibril spoke at a Dec.
18 meeting of three aims: liberating Palestine by eliminating
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and other
``American collaborators,'' continuing the fight against America
and remaining in the background of any attack.
   The Turkish nationals were brought into the plot in September,
the newspaper said.

   A bomb exploded Sunday outside a house
occupied by black South African exiles and injured several people,
witnesses said.
   The blast in Kamanga, a suburb of the capital, damaged nearby
houses but no one was believed killed, a neighbor said.
   The explosion left a 6-foot-deep crater in the sidewalk and
damaged part of a wall and a boundary fence, said the woman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Police sealed off approaches to the scene, but it was not
immediately known if South Africans were among the unspecified
number of people injured.
   Police released no details of the bombing.
   Last month, the guerrilla-backed African National Congress
accused the white-dominated government in South Africa of mounting
a new sabotage campaign against its members and facilities in
Zambia.
   Three Lusaka-based ANC officials were injured in a series of
blasts at ANC offices in June.
   One person died near the ANC headquarters building in downtown
Lusaka when explosives he was carrying blew up, police said June 22.
   The ANC is the main guerrilla organization fighting white rule
in South Africa.
   In recent years, ANC facilities in black-governed southern
African nations have been regular targets of military and sabotage
attacks by South African agents.

<HEAD>Pravda Says Railroad Workers May Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Railroad workers have called a strike on the
Moscow-Leningrad line that could paralyze the northwestern Soviet
Union, the Communist Party daily Pravda said Sunday.
   The report of railroad workers' discontent over wages and work
conditions came after hundreds of thousands of coal miners in the
Ukraine and Siberia walked off their jobs earlier this month over
poor living and working conditions.
   Railroad director A. Zaitsev spoke of the strike calls in a
briefing for Soviet journalists, Pravda said. The report did not
say when the strike might occur.
   Pravda said a railroad strike would be an ``extraordinarily
dangerous action, leading to a very real catastrophe for the
northwest economic region.''
   Another walkout following the coal miners' strike would add to
the economic chaos and could make strikes more attractive to other
disgruntled Soviet workers.
   The Pravda article said transportation strikes were prohibited
in many countries, intimating that officials would not tolerate a
walkout.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sided with the striking coal
miners against bureaucrats who he said were holding back reforms,
and he promised broad improvements in their lives. Most returned to
work.
   In a speech July 19 on the coal miners' strike, Gorbachev said
there had been calls for a railroad engineers' strike beginning
Aug. 1 and warned against it. Such a strike would damage efforts to
reform the economy and improve conditions for everyone, Gorbachev
said.
   Pravda, quoting the Moscow-Leningrad railroad's newspaper, said
a strike would shut down factories in the northeast Soviet Union
and cause ``chaos in our everyday lives.''
   It said railroad workers complained they were not given adequate
time to eat during their shifts. It said they claimed unjust wage
discrepancies among workers at stations along the 375-mile route.
   Pravda questioned why ``independent activists'' were making
demands rather than the unions that represent the railroad workers.
   Soviet unions long have done little but follow official policy,
and workers have begun voicing their demands outside the official
union structure.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Bill Bradley told the nation's
governors Sunday that dramatic changes in the Soviet Union could
mean future economic benefits for the United States but little
immediate opportunity for individual states.
   Bradley, D-N.J., who recently traveled throughout the Soviet
Union, said the United States should be ``rational capitalists, not
romantic capitalists'' in dealing with the Soviets.
   He cautioned against extending credit to the Soviets because,
``I don't want to help the Soviets avoid the choice between guns
and butter.''
   Efforts by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to improve the
economy will require reduced defense spending and therefore offer
the potential of arms agreements, Bradley said. But, he said, the
Soviet Union will have little money to spend on non-military deals
with the United States.
   ``It seems to me there's going to be very little way to make
very much money in the Soviet Union for a long time to come,'' he
said.
   The governors, meeting at the four-day, bipartisan National
Governors' Association, have been focusing on ways to improve U.S.
economic competitiveness and how states can enhance business
arrangements with other countries. President Bush plans to address
the group on Monday.
   Maine Gov. John McKernan, a Republican, asked Bradley how much
potential the Soviet changes could offer state businesses.
   ``Don't expect your Maine businessmen to be making billions in
the Soviet Union, unless they're willing to treat it as the
ultimate wildcat,'' Bradley said.
   Also at the conference was Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan, who told the governors that the world economy's
increasing reliance on technology will mean states will have to
devote more attention to education.
   ``The major capital of the next century is going to be minds
that produce ideas,'' Greenspan told a gathering of association's
executive committee.
   ``More and higher quality education must be presumed to be
crucial in America's competition with our industrial partners for
economic world leadership,'' Greenspan said.
   Outside the meeting, about 50 abortion-rights demonstrators held
a brief rally to urge governors not to back efforts to restrict
access to abortions.
   The meeting is the governors' first since the Supreme Court gave
states greater leeway in regulating abortion. Governors steered
clear of the issue in their formal meetings, but abortion _ and the
political impact of the decision _ was being discussed in the halls.
   Delaware Gov. Michael Castle, a Republican, said abortion ``will
be a dominant issue'' in the states.

   The Shiite Moslem captors of a U.S.
Marine held hostage in Lebanon said they would hang him Monday
unless Israel released a Shiite Moslem clergyman kidnapped by
Israeli commandos.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth threatened to kill
Lt. Col. William R. Higgins ``at exactly 3 p.m. Monday,'' or 8 a.m.
EDT, if Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid has not been freed by then.
   Obeid is alleged to be the spiritual leader of the Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah militia in south Lebanon and to have played a role in
Higgins' abduction.
   In Washington, the White House said the kidnappers will be held
``fully responsible'' for the safety of Higgins and other American
hostages.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called the threat
``an affront to the entire civilized community.'' She said
Secretary of State James Baker III discussed Higgins' situation
earlier Sunday at a Paris meeting with U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Israeli officials refused comment on the group's threat.
   ``This will be our first response to the stupid Israeli
aggression and the flagrant American support that proves U.S.
complicity in the crime,'' the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth said in a statement delivered Sunday to a Western news agency
in Beirut. It called Higgins, 44, a ``proven spy.''
   In a statement issued Dec. 12, 1988, the organization said it
had sentenced Higgins to death and said he ``made full confessions
about his espionage activities.''
   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., was serving as head of an observer
group attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when
he was seized Feb. 17, 1988. His captors accused him of spying for
the CIA.
   Sunday's typewritten Arabic statement was not accompanied by a
picture of Higgins, the usual sign of authenticity. But it appeared
typed on the same machine and the same paper as earlier statements.
   It said Obeid's abduction ``will not deter us from continuing
the struggle and resistance to snip out the cancer planted in our
blessed land and chop off the hand of the arrogants headed by the
great Satan, America.''
   In Iran, the interior minister said Islamic groups worldwide
will retaliate against Israel and the United States for the
abduction of Obeid. Israeli troops were put on alert.
   Israeli commandos armed with silencer-equipped pistols stole
into the Lebanese village of Jibchit early Friday, kidnapped Obeid
from his apartment, and flew him to Israel in a helicopter. His
cousin Ahmed Obeid and a friend, Majid Fahs, also were seized,
Lebanese police said.
   Israel described Ahmed Obeid and Majid Fahs as ``assistants'' of
Obeid.
   Obeid has denied involvement in Higgins' abduction or in
Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella for Shiite Moslem factions
holding most of the 17 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.
   According to Israeli sources who demanded anonymity, Obeid was
involved in the operation to kidnap Higgins and held the Marine for
a time in his home. ``I believe he can tell us,'' one source said
when asked if Obeid was expected to provide information on Higgins.
   ``It is very natural that the Islamic clergy ... and militant
groups throughout the world will take action against the interests
of Israel and the United States,'' Iranian Interior Minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi told a news conference Sunday in Tehran. ``They
will not allow them to live comfortably.''
   He named Hezbollah as one of the Moslem groups that should
retaliate.
   Asked about the fate of hostages in Lebanon, Mohtashemi said:
``The issue of the hostages has no direct connection with us.''
   An Iranian newspaper said Obeid's abduction jeopardized moves to
free the hostages, who include nine Americans. The hostage held
longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.
   ``The Zionists have introduced a new threat to humanitarian
efforts to release hostages in Lebanon,'' the Tehran Times said in
an editorial Sunday.
   The English-language daily said such actions ``can upset the
psychological atmosphere needed'' for ending their ordeal.
   Israeli officials have accused Obeid of instigating attacks on
Israel and hinted that his kidnapping may have been arranged to
prepare for a possible prisoner swap, but Hezbollah leaders have
ruled out a swap.
   Three Israeli servicemen are believed held by Hezbollah _
soldiers Rahamim Alsheikh and Yossi Fink, captured Feb. 17, 1986,
when guerrillas ambushed their patrol in south Lebanon, and air
force navigator Ron Arad, seized Oct. 16, 1986, when his plane
crashed near the Lebanese city of Sidon.
   The Sunday Times in London said talks to arrange the soldiers'
release may now resume because Israel has a bargaining chip in
Obeid. It said Israel and Iran had conducted talks about trading
hostages, including a recent meeting in London last month.
   Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Allon Liel said he did not
know of any talks.
   Lebanon's acting prime minister, Salim Hoss, said he has
requested U.N. and Red Cross help in efforts to secure Obeid's
release.

<HEAD>Judge Penalizes Doctor for Patient Dumping</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal agency judge says a Victoria, Texas,
obstetrician let his fear of a malpractice lawsuit cloud his
judgment when the doctor ordered a poor, sick woman who was about
to give birth transferred to another hospital 160 miles away.
   Dr. Michael L. Burditt, the first physician prosecuted for
violating a 1986 federal law against patient dumping, is expected
to fight the $20,000 civil penalty imposed upon him by the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   The agency on Sunday released the 44-page ruling by
Administrative Law Judge Charles E. Stratton upholding the HHS
inspector general's sanctions against Burditt, but reducing the
fine from $25,000 to $20,000.
   The Texas Medical Association, the state branch of the American
Medical Association, has previously agreed to pay Burditt's legal
costs and any fine stemming from his controversial handling of the
case of Rosa Rivera.
   Mrs. Rivera showed up at the emergency room of DeTar Hospital in
Victoria on Dec. 5, 1986, to have her sixth child without seeing a
doctor during the pregnancy and with blood pressure of 210 over 160
_ high enough to cause stroke and death.
   Burditt, then chief of the hospital's obstetrical department,
was summoned by phone to treat the indigent woman because he was
next on a list to handle emergency obstetrical calls. He told a
nurse ``he did not want to take care of this lady'' and said she
should be transferred to a better equipped hospital in Galveston.
   Burditt drove in, examined her and ordered the transfer to
proceed, despite the objections of nurses worried that it would
violate the then-new law against patient dumping. That law
specifies that hospitals must treat patients in medical emergencies
or in active labor.
   Burditt said he would choose his patients until DeTar, a private
hospital, paid his malpractice premiums. But he also stayed to
deliver a baby of another poor, uninsured women who was seven
months' pregnant and bleeding.
   Mrs. Rivera, in tears, was eventually transferred and bore a
healthy 6-pound baby boy in the ambulance parked on the roadside 40
miles east of Victoria. She and the baby were returned to DeTar,
where another doctor treated them.
   Stratton wrote that the 1986 law ``was enacted to close the door
on the shameful practice of denying emergency hospital care ... to
many persons in dire need.'' He cited an estimate at a
congressional hearing that as many as 200,000 persons were denied
emergency hospital care each year, primarily for economic reasons.
   ``It is a tragedy that Dr. Burditt, a well-respected physician,
a decent personable man with loyal friends and patients, let his
parochial interests and personal feelings ... interfere with his
exercise of sound professional medical judgment,'' Stratton said.
   Burditt testified in January that he had sought to avoid
high-risk patients, in part because of his need to keep regular
hours as the sole parent of a teen-age daughter.
   ``While he never meant to harm Mrs. Rivera, he further
compounded his initial recklessness, in ordering her transfer, by
allowing his anger at having his authority challenged by nurses ...
(to) close his mind to the merit of cancelling the transfer,''
Stratton said.
   His ``unyielding attitude'' did not ``prompt him to investigate
the nurses' concerns, treat Mrs. Rivera before she was transferred,
or treat Mrs. Rivera when she was returned to DeTar Hospital,''
Stratton said. ``In this instance, although Dr. Burditt was not
venal, he lost sight of his oath as a physician.''
   The benefits of the transfer ``depended on two fragile
individuals surviving a 160-170 mile ride bereft of treatment,''
said Stratton. ``He acted in reckless disregard and deliberate
ignorance'' of the law.
   Stratton said there were both aggravating and mitigating
circumstances in the case. Among the former, he said, were
Burditt's failure to consult another doctor in the hospital and his
refusal to treat her after she had the baby.
   The mitigating factors included Mrs. Rivera's own failure to get
prenatal care and the hospital's lack of medical records in her
case. Another mitigating factor, Stratton said, was Burditt's
subsequent role in creating a new prenatal clinic for poor women in
Victoria and helping improve transfer procedures for sick patients
in the small city between Houston and Corpus Christi.
   DeTar, which nearly lost its eligibility for Medicare funding,
paid a $5,000 fine after an investigation by the Dallas regional
office of the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Donald P. Wilcox, attorney for the Texas Medical Association, on
Saturday called Stratton's ruling disturbing.
   ``We thought what he did was defensible and accepted practice,''
Wilcox said.

<TEXT>
   The niece of the late U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper, a
former city commissioner and a lawyer who has been linked to an
international arms dealer lead the Democratic field in Tuesday's
primary contest for Pepper's seat.
   On the Republican side, state Sen. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen hopes to
win the nomination outright, then watch more Democratic
bloodletting in an Aug. 15 runoff vote.
   Her main obsctale to winning the 50 percent-plus-one margin
needed to clinch the 18th District nomination is the candidacy of
Carlos Perez, a wealthy conservative activist.
   Race has been an election issue in a city where the rapid growth
of the Hispanic population complicates existing tension between
whites and blacks. Some Hispanics see in the vote a chance to put
the first Cuban-American in Congress.
   Both GOP front-runners are Cuban-born, as is the Democrat
favored in recent polls, Rosario Kennedy.
   The special election to fill the Pepper's seat is to be held
Aug. 29. Pepper, who died May 30 at age 88, filled the seat since
1962.
   Some expect the voting to follow the recent pattern in Florida
politics: Democrats divide in their primary, then get conquered by
a well-funded Republican leading a united party.
   Republicans hold an unprecedented 10-8 lead in the state's
congressional delegation, won a U.S. Senate seat last year and will
try to re-elect Gov. Bob Martinez in 1990.
   ``It was bound to be a fierce campaign in the end, and the
beneficiary would be Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,'' said Phil Hamersmith, a
strategist for Ms. Kennedy. Hamersmith said he was confident the
Democrats would unite after the expected runoff.
   Ms. Kennedy, who resigned her Miami city commission seat to run,
is the unquestioned front-runner among the Democrats. She has the
endorsements of the AFL-CIO, The Miami Herald and state party
Chairman Simon Ferro.
   But she is given little chance of winning a majority against six
other candidates. Some strategists say that because turnout is
expected to be low among the district's 100,000 registered
Democrats, a candidate could reach the runoff with as few as 5,000
votes.
   Personalities and backgrounds have dominated the Democratic race.
   On Saturday, three of the Democratic contenders called on Ms.
Kennedy to withdraw from the race because of negative campaign
mailers sent out by her camp.
   Two of her opponents, lawyer Gerald Richman and businessman
Bernard Anscher, said they would be unable to support Ms. Kennedy
if she were the nominee. The other, Jo Ann Pepper, said she would
have to think hard about it.
   Ms. Kennedy's campaign aides said the mailers were necessary to
counter challenges to her ethics and attacks on her personal life
and Hispanic roots.
   Her campaign mailings highlighted Richman's defense of arms
dealer Sarkis Soghanalian. Richman, who used Soghanalian's plane to
fly to Tallahassee to meet the campaign qualifying deadline,
defended the arms dealer as a patriot.
   Polls show Ms. Pepper and Richman running closest to Ms.
Kennedy. But Anscher, black intellectual Marvin Dunn, black real
estate agent Sonny Wright and striking Eastern Airlines pilot John
Paul Rosser all hope to put together enough votes to slip into the
runoff.
   Richman, who is white, opens his speeches by calling the 18th
District ``an American seat.''
   Among registered Democratic voters in the district, 52 percent
are white, 32 percent are black and 16 percent are Hispanic.
   Ms. Pepper, the niece of the late congressman and one of his
closest companions the last few years, says she wants to continue
the Pepper agenda. A federal probation officer without experience
in elective office, she says she learned government in her travels
with Pepper.
   ``I am a Pepper,'' she said recently. ``I had the best teacher.
I think my opponents wish the could be a Pepper, too.''
   On the Republican side, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen raised a campaign-high
$200,000. She emphasizes her conservative views and legislative
experience. Her husband, U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen, called a
news conference last week to denounce Democratic charges that his
appearance in his wife's campaign advertising is unlawful.
   Perez, a fervent supporter of Ronald Reagan and Oliver North,
who has endorsed his candidacy, insists he can win, while former
North Miami Mayor John Stembridge and insurance broker David
Fleischer are GOP longshots.

<HEAD>GAO Criticizes Desert Management</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal Bureau of Land Management has
allowed commercial and recreational interests to take priority over
the protection of wildlife in the California Desert, government
auditors said in a report released Sunday.
   The General Accounting Office said that while there has been a
shortage of money to develop wildlife protection plans, ``even if
more funds were available ... BLM has not demonstrated the
willingness to take actions necessary to protect wildlife
interests.''
   For example, the GAO said, the bureau has permitted motorcycle
races and established ``free play'' areas for off-highway vehicles
in areas important to the desert tortoise, has allowed livestock
grazing that is harmful to some species, and has placed
insufficient restrictions on mining operations.
   ``BLM has frequently allowed the needs of competing interests,
such as recreation and commercial use, to take precedence over
wildlife interests when conflicts arise,'' the GAO said.
   It said data on the desert tortoise _ an important gauge for the
health of habitat for other species in the desert_ ``indicate that
the effects are not favorable.''
   ``Desert tortoise numbers have decreased dramatically in recent
years, and according to tortoise experts, the species may now be
sliding irreversibly toward extinction,'' the GAO said.
   The California Desert Conservation Area was established by the
federal government in 1976 to protect a 25-million-acre area that
represents one-fourth of California's total acreage.
   ``While BLM considered wildlife needs during its overall land
use planning process for the California Desert, the wildlife
protection objectives envisioned in the overall land use plan have
not been achieved,'' the GAO study said.
   The GAO report was released by Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who
said the desert is not being adequately protected against ``callous
usage and the inroads of development.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Bloch Part of Network Stealing High-Tech Secrets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French agents filmed Felix Bloch, the U.S. diplomat
under investigation for spying, passing a briefcase to a KGB
official involved in circumventing a ban on selling high technology
to the Soviets, French newspapers reported.
   The weekend edition of Liberation reported that agents of the
French counterespionage agency shot the footage in early 1989.
   The story, which cited a ``very good source in Paris,'' said the
film did not show the contents of the briefcase.
   Bloch, 54, served at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna from 1980 to
1987 and was the second-highest ranking diplomat there in his last
four years.
   He returned to Washington in 1987 and became director of the
State Department's office of European regional political-economic
affairs. He is considered a specialist on the European Community.
   Bloch was placed on administrative leave from the State
Department on June 22 while investigators looked into allegations
that he spied for the Soviet Union.
   The weekly Journal du Dimanche, citing no sources, reported
Sunday that the man filmed with Bloch was a member of the Soviet
diplomatic mission to UNESCO, but also a spy for the new KGB
service known as Agency 4. The agency is charged with stealing
sensitive techonology secrets, the newspaper said.
   ``Several times, the American was in Brussels and Paris. An
economi expert, he prepared economic meetings of NATO, but also
those of COCOM, the Paris-based organization responsible for
authorizing technology transfers to the East,'' the newspaper said.
   ``From here, the question posed by Western counter-espionage
services: Was Felix Bloch part of a network destined to penetrate
COCOM?''
   The 17-member Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export
Controls comprises Japan, Australia and all members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization except Iceland. As East-West relations
have improved, the Soviet Union and some European countries,
including West Germany, have pressed for the relaxation of
restraints.
   The sale of high technology to the East was among the topics
discussed during meetings in July between President Francois
Mitterrand and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   A five-week investigation into Bloch's activities by Austrian
security authorities turned up no independent evidence that Bloch
engaged in espionage or met with suspected KGB contacts, according
to Robert Danzinger, director general for Austrian public security.
   On Friday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, arriving
in Paris for an international conference on Cambodia, said his
country and Bloch had ``no link that could raise the slightest
suspicion.''
   According to the Journal du Dimanche and Liberation, Bloch's
position at the embassy gave him access to sensitive information
including the identity of Central Intelligence Agency operatives in
Vienna and other Eastern European countries.
   He also had access to secret codes used by various American
embassies for internal communications and classified information on
disarmament negotiations taking place in Vienna.

<HEAD>Buildings Burn in Idaho Hamlet, Evacuations in Oregon</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Forest and range fires ravaged an Idaho mountain resort and
forced evacuation of remote homes and ranches in Oregon on Sunday,
but the threat eased from a California blaze that chased 2,500
people from their homes.
   Hundreds of western wildfires _ most caused by lightning last
week _ have destroyed 88,600 acres in California, Idaho, Oregon and
Washington since Wednesday.
   In Idaho's Boise National Forest, three blazes exploded into a
single firestorm overnight Saturday, generating cyclonic winds and
outracing firefighters, destroying 25 buildings in the resort
hamlet of Lowman.
   The popular Haven Lodge was destroyed, but officials could not
say how many homes or other commercial buildings were lost, said
Forest Service spokesman Pat Entwistle. No injuries were reported,
Entwistle said.
   While crews pushed the flames away from Lowman, Entwistle said,
they were bracing late Sunday to withstand another assault by the
out-of-control blaze. ``They're expecting it to really whip up
again,'' she said.
   National Guard troops were put on traffic-control duty to
prevent looting in the town, population 150, about 50 miles
northwest of Boise.
   The Boise National forest blaze, which blackened 10,000 acres of
timber by Sunday, was among more than 400 lightning-caused blazes
in central and southern Idaho.
   In all, 38,400 acres of forest were charred by the blazes,
according to the federal Boise Interagency Fire Center.
   Lightning-caused forest and range fires in eastern Oregon forced
evacuation of 20 homes Sunday and of about 30 ranchers Saturday
night, said Gay Brockus, spokeswoman for the Wallowa-Whitman
National Forest.
   The threatened homes were in the Stices Gulch area, and the
ranches were around Sutton Creek, both near Baker. A barn was
destroyed in the Sutton Creek area outside Baker, but ground crews
and air drops of fire-retardant chemicals saved other homes,
Brockus said.
   In all, lightning-struck Oregon fires that began last week had
burned 27,000 acres of Oregon forest and range. In addition to
blazes burning out of control near Baker, there was an uncontrolled
fire Sunday in the Malheur National Forest east of the town of John
Day.
   In the foothills of California's Sierra Nevada, some of the
2,500 people forced to evacuate over the weekend by a grass and
brush fire were allowed back home Sunday as firefighters tried to
contain the blaze on steep, inaccessible terrain.
   The fire, which destroyed seven homes and 16 outbuildings and
scorched at least 7,200 acres since Friday, was 60 percent
contained and not an immediate threat to any more houses, said U.S.
Forest Service spokesman Mike LeFevre.
   It wasn't known when the 1,800 firefighters would be able to
circle the fire above Fresno on the edge of the Sierra National
Forest.
   Residents of Auberry and New Auberry were allowed to go home
Sunday, more than 24 hours after being forced to flee the advancing
flames, LeFevre said. But those forced out of several nearby
communities were told to stay away.
   For some residents of the rolling Sierra foothills, the weekend
evacuation was a nightmarish reminder of previous disasters. Wilma
and James Gould were burned out of their Meadow Lakes home 27 years
ago and rebuilt in the same spot.
   ``Once in a lifetime is enough. It's frightening. It's
frightening,'' Wilma Gould said. ``We grabbed a change of clothes,
a couple of blankets, our medication and that's all.''
   Investigators said people or machinery caused the fire that
began Friday but still did not know if it was deliberately set. Two
other fires in the same general area scorched a total of 600 acres
of land.
   Elsewhere in California, a brush fire in the Cleveland National
Forest southeast of Los Angeles was reported 40 percent contained
Sunday after burning 4,100 acres of brush and destroying a house
and travel trailer. Its cause was under investigation.
   A fire that burned 10,500 acres of brush and destroyed four
homes near the central coast community of Atascadero, Calif., over
the weekend was fully contained Sunday.
   In Washington state, a forest fire in the northern Cascade
mountains was held to 800 acres Sunday. Firefighters reported the
blaze in the Okanogan National Forest 55 percent contained, said
U.S. Forest Service spokesman Greg Thayer.
   The fire was thought to be started by lightning on July 14, but
wasn't detected until July 23, Thayer said.

   Anti-apartheid leader
Albertina Sisulu returned Sunday from a trip abroad and more than
200 singing, dancing supporters welcomed the 71-year-old black
woman home.
   Mrs. Sisulu had been granted a 31-day passport to allow her to
accept an invitation from President Bush to meet with him in
Washington.
   She met with Bush last month and led a delegation of leaders of
the banned United Democratic Front in meetings with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson
and with officials in Belgium and France.
   ``I am so happy to be back with my people,'' Mrs. Sisulu told
the airport crowd.
   It took her an hour to get her luggage. The South African Press
Association quoted a police spokesman at the airport as saying only
that it had been ``held up.''
   The independent news agency also quoted a political activist,
who asked not to be identified by name, as saying police ``reminded
Mrs. Sisulu about her conditions of house arrest and warned her not
to make a statement at the airport.''
   Mrs. Sisulu had urged Bush and Mrs. Thatcher to impose more
sweeping economic sanctions against South Africa to force the
white-controlled government to negotiate with the black majority.
Neither has endorsed such an idea.
   The welcoming crowd at the airport sang a Zulu anthem ``God
Bless Africa'' and many raised their fists in a black-power salute.
They danced and pressed around Mrs. Sisulu as she walked to her car.
   Some held placards. One read, ``You strike a woman, you strike a
rock!'' _ the slogan of a 1956 black women's protest of a law
requiring blacks to carry passes. Mrs. Sisulu was one of the
leaders of that protest campaign.

   Actress Cybill Shepherd and U.S. Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., are among those expected to speak on
abortion at the National Women's Political Caucus convention here
this week.
   At the four-day convention opening Thursday, leaders plan to
unveil a national plan to tap the voting strength of people who
favor abortion rights in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling
giving states more latitude in governing abortion.
   Caucus Chairwoman Irene Natividad said the organization will be
targeting legislative seats in several states to diminish
anti-abortion strength.
   ``I see choice, the right to reproductive freedom, as the
politicizing issue for the women of the `90s, the same way the ERA
was the politicizing issue for the women of my generation, the `60s
and `70s,'' said Natividad.
   ``In many ways, it is perhaps a clearer issue for a lot of
women, because it hits a lot of women more directly. ERA was more
of a class issue or group issue. Choice is an individual issue,''
she said.
   The high court's July 3 abortion ruling is bringing a new sense
of urgency to the biennial convention of the 77,000-member caucus,
whose goal for two decades has been to put more women in public
office, organizers say.
   It changes the focus of the convention which is expected to draw
1,500 delegates, alternates and guests, said Dede Wolfson,
chairwoman of the Minnesota Women's Political Caucus and convention
host.
   ``The focus would not be predominantly on the abortion issue if
the Webster case hadn't occurred. The focus would have been on how
to get women elected. We'll still focus on how to get women
elected, but there will be two major components at this
convention,'' she said.
   In Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, Inc., the Supreme
Court upheld certain restrictive provisions of a Missouri law on
abortion.
   Natividad, Wolfson and Minnesota officials who are caucus
members look at the Supreme Court's ruling as an erosion of women's
rights, but not necessarily without political value.
   ``It's going to energize the women's movement,'' said
Minneapolis City Council Member Barbara Carlson.
   ``Women have become so busy with their own lives and careers
that what they needed was something like this to coalesce women.
... For the first time, I almost feel like the suffragettes must
have felt. They took to the streets. I suspect women are going to
do that again,'' Carlson said.
   Natividad said abortion rights will not move to the top of the
caucus agenda if abortion restrictions tighten.
   The caucus is the political arm of the women's movement and
should remain committed to getting women elected to office, though
it will continue to be concerned with other women's issues, she
said.

<HEAD>China Breaks out of Diplomatic Isolation At Conference</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Cambodia, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conference of 19 countries seeking peace in
Cambodia has allowed China to break the diplomatic isolation
imposed after the June crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing.
   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met Sunday with French
Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and British Foreign Secretary John
Major.
   He was expected to meet U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark and others before leaving
Paris.
   Baker and Qian were seated next to each other at the conference
table, where the foreign ministers were arranged in alphabetical
order by the spellings of their country's names in French.
   U.S. officials said on condition of anonymity that the two
exchanged ``cordial greetings,'' but did not discuss substantive
issues.
   President Bush ruled out high-level U.S. visits to China after
the military suppression of the pro-democracy movement. But Baker
does not consider the ban a barrier to meeting with the Chinese
foreign minister outside Beijing, the officials said.
   French officials said Dumas' meeting with Qian kept strictly to
the Cambodia issue. When Qian noted with regret the cooling of
bilateral relations, Dumas called attention to the reason for the
chill, they said.
   Canadian Foreign Minister Joe Clark told reporters that he would
restate his country's objections to the crackdown when he met with
Qian, but said, ``We won't have a solution to Cambodia without the
active participation of China.''
   China supports the Khmer Rouge, the strongest guerrilla faction
facing the Vietnamese-backed government of Premier Hun Sun. Most
other countries contend that a chief aim of the peace process is
finding a way to keep the Khmer Rouge from returning to power.
   The Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians
during its three-year reign of Cambodia, ended by a Vietnamese
invasion in 1978. Vietnam is to withdraw its estimated 60,000
troops from Cambodia by late September.

<HEAD>Girls Mark 10 Years at Father Flanagan's Boys Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOYS TOWN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Something was missing at Father Edward
Flanagan's famed home for boys.
   ``A city without girls is like a hug without a kiss _ it's good
but it's not enough,'' said the Rev. Val Peter, executive director
of Boys Town.
   So 10 years ago, the first five girls came to the 1,300-acre
campus on the western edge of Omaha. Now, 76 women count themselves
among the more than 17,000 alumni of Flanagan's home for troubled
and abandoned youth.
   About 400 of those alumni participated in a three-day reunion
that ended Sunday.
   Boys Town provides care in a foster-home setting to troubled
children sent by courts, social service agencies and churches and
to a few children who arrive there on their own.
   Of the 526 current Boys Town residents, 201 are girls aged 9 to
17, Peter said.
   The transition was not always easy for the first groups of girls
entering the village founded on Flanagan's belief that there's no
such thing as a bad boy.
   Although she was not among the first five girls to arrive at
Boys Town, Joni Renken was one of the first five girls to graduate
from Boys Town's high school in 1983. She remembers boys' faces
pressed against the windows in classroom doors as some of the
pioneer girls entered the school.
   ``It was weird because they were looking around at us and
running into stuff,'' she said Saturday. ``You were like so
outnumbered.''
   There was little flirting between the boys and girls, said 1987
Boys Town graduate Traci Schacht.
   ``More or less they treated me like a sister,'' she said.
   The addition of girls challenged a staff used to dealing only
with boys, Peter said. The gym teacher was not an early convert,
said Mrs. Renken of Lincoln, who lived at Boys Town for one full
school year and parts of two others.
   ``Gym class was one of the worst things because they treated us
like boys and they worked us like dogs,'' she said.
   Society was unaware of a problem with wayward girls when
Flanagan founded the home in 1917, or even when Mickey Rooney
visited in 1938 for the filming of the famed movie ``Boys Town,''
Peter said.
   An awareness of the need to reach out to troubled girls grew, he
said, but the first five came by accident in 1979 for shelter.
   ``They didn't have any place to go. Then we liked them so much
we said they could stay. And we've been taking them ever since,''
Peter said.
   ``Some of the boys that had been here a long time ... I think
were kind of resentful that the girls were intruding on their
space,'' Mrs. Renken said.
   ``Then they were really accepting overall. I guess they had a
change of heart ... It was like a brother-sister relationship.''
   That is exactly the relationship Peter hopes to foster.
   ``I hold the capacity for friendship between a boy and a girl to
be the key to all success in marriage and family. If we can't be
friends, all the rest of it isn't going to hold us together.''
   There is a continuing debate about how many girls to enroll,
Peter said.
   ``The boys are warmly recommending we take more girls, and the
girls are warmly recommending that we not take any more girls. They
like the ratio just as it is,'' he said.
   Mrs. Renken said the ratio was about one girl per 100 boys when
she lived at Boys Town.
   ``We liked the ratio when we were here, too.''

<HEAD>Indian and Sri Lankan Officials Meet on Indian Troop Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sri Lanka's foreign minister met with
Indian officials Sunday to negotiate a date for the withdrawal of
45,000 Indian peacekeeping troopers from Sri Lanka.
   No details were given. Negotiations were to resume Monday.
   Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne arrived Saturday,
the day after India withdrew 600 soldiers in a gesture that ended a
two-month diplomatic stalemate and led to the weekend talks.
   The Indian forces came to this island off India's southern coast
under a peace agreement signed two years ago to help disarm Tamil
rebels demanding autonomy in northern Sri Lanka.
   But the fighting continued and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe
Premadasa demanded the Indian troopers leave by July 29, the second
anniversary of the Indian-brokered peace accord.
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi refused, saying the agreement
had not been fully implemented.
   In Sri Lanka, people rushed to shops to stock up on supplies
Sunday as the government relaxed a nationwide curfew for 10 hours.
The curfew had been imposed at midnight Thursday to thwart violence
on the anniversary of the peace agreement.
   The curfew went back into effect at 4 p.m. Sunday, but state-run
radio said it would be lifted at 5 a.m. Monday. It reported
military officials said the anniversary had passed peacefully.
   United News of India said Wijeratne met for 2{ hours with Indian
Defense Minister Krishna Chandra Pant and then held talks with
Foreign Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao. The news agency said the
discussions were ``conducted in a warm and friendly atmposhere''
but did not elaborate.
   It is believed Wijeratne also discussed a cease-fire between
Indian troops and the dominant Sri Lankan rebel group, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   The Tamil Tigers have started their own talks with Premadasa's
government over ending their 6-year-old separatist campaign in
which at least 11,000 people have been killed, including about
1,000 Indian soldiers.
   The Indian troops were supposed to disarm the Tamil Tigers and
other militant groups under the peace accord, which also promised
limited autonomy to the minority Tamils.
   But the Tamil Tigers pulled out of the agreement and attacked
the Indian soldiers.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
population of 16 million. They claim discrimination by the Buddhist
Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population and control
the government and military.

<HEAD>Rain in Missouri and Much of South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain caused flooding Sunday in Missouri, where winds gusted to
40 mph in some areas, and scattered showers and thunderstorms were
reported throughout the South.
   Roads and fields throughout central Missouri were flooded with
rain brought on by a cluster of thunderstorms that moved in from
eastern Nebraska.
   Columbia, Mo., reported nearly 6 inches of rain, Edinia got
nearly 4 and Centralia measured just over 3 inches of rain. Brief,
heavy rain and gusty winds to 40 mph were reported at Cape
Girardeau.
   Showers and thunderstorms were rumbling along a stationary front
that stretched from the Missouri River Valley into the lower Ohio
River Valley.
   Thunderstorms with potentially heavy rain were across southern
Illinois and southern Indiana into eastern Kentucky.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms developed in warm and
humid air over central Alabama and eastern North Carolina. Showers
and thunderstorms were scattered across southern Florida.
   Rain and thunderstorms clustered over northeast Colorado Sunday
morning. Over 3 inches of rain fell in two hours near Fleming, Colo.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across parts of
central and southern New York. Gusty thunderstorm winds blew down
trees and power lines in Wilton and Saratoga Springs.
   The nation's low Sunday morning was 40 degrees at Houlton,
Maine, and Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Salinas, Calif., to 105 at Needles, Calif.
   Monday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in the lower half of the Mississippi Valley, the lower Ohio and
Tennessee valleys, the mid-Atlantic states and the Gulf Coast
region.
   Showers and thunderstorms were to be more numerous in western
Pennsylvania, eastern Kentucky, Mississippi and Louisiana, the
eastern slopes of the Colorado Rockies, northern Arizona, New
Mexico and western Montana.
   Rain was expected in the Pacific Northwest.
   High temperatures were to reach the 80s or 90s across much of
the nation, with 70s in the Pacific Northwest, the upper Great
Lakes, the upper Ohio Valley and New England; around 100 degrees
over parts of the western Dakotas and northern Montana, northwest
Texas and southwest Oklahoma; and between 100 and 115 degrees
across the desert Southwest.

   Health care for veterans, diminishing clout in
Congress and a visit by President Bush comprise the agenda for the
68th convention of the Disabled American Veterans, which began
Sunday.
   Bush will be the first president to address the 1.1 million
member organization, said DAV spokesman Walter Phillips.
   Bush's appearance here Monday afternoon comes just months after
he signed into law a bill elevating the Veterans Administration to
cabinet level as the Department of Veterans Affairs.
   The convention comes amid concern veterans are losing some of
their clout on Capitol Hill. That notion must be reversed,
according to DAV national commander Billy E. Kirby of Clifton,
Texas.
   ``It is your future in jeopardy, your well-being that's
threatened unless you get involved,'' Kirby told delegates
attending the opening session Sunday.
   Kirby said one of his proudest moments as head of the DAV came
this past spring when he went to the White House to witness ``a
30-year-old dream become a reality'' with the elevation of the VA
to cabinet status.
   ``With a stroke of the president's pen, veterans stepped forward
to the Cabinet table and into the national policy-setting arena,''
Kirby said in remarks prepared for the convention's opening session.
   Still, Kirby said, there is concern that America's veterans lack
clout in Congress.
   Influential Congressmen have repeatedly warned ``that our
programs are in deep trouble if more veterans don't get involved,''
he said.
   ``We must find ways to harness the involvement and advocacy we
see disabled vets practicing in their hometowns,'' Kirby said. ``We
must channel more of that enthusiasm for service toward Washington,
and into the halls of Congress.''
   Veterans health care will be a major area of concern for the
6,000 people attending the convention, according to Phillips.
   Tommy Clack, who lost both legs and his right arm during a
firefight in Vietnam in 1969, was honored Sunday as the Disabled
American Veterans' man of the year.
   Clack has worked for the past decade at Atlanta's Veterans
Administration Medical Center, where he spent much of his 21-month
recovery following his injury in Vietnam.
   Clack, 42, of Stone Mountain, Ga., holds Silver Star, Bronze
Star and Purple Heart medals. He has spoken about veterans' issues
in all 50 states.
   ``God left me with my brain intact, my mouth in gear and my left
arm to be independent. What else do we need in life?'' he said in a
recent interview. ``We're lucky to be alive, and let's go forward.''

<TEXT>
   Lebanon's ambassador to Iraq was quoted
Sunday as confirming that Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun
has acquired missiles and other weapons from Iraq to bolster his
war effort against Syrian forces.
   Artillery duels raged between Syrian and Christian forces,
setting huge fires in residential districts in the city's Moslem
and Christian sectors.
   Four people were killed and 52 were wounded in the shelling that
began after sundown and continued for nine hours.
   The casualties raised the toll to 506 killed and 2,118 wounded
since the current round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil
war broke out March 8, pitting Aoun's 20,000 troops against the
Syrians and their Druse Moslem allies.
   Fire brigades in east and west Beirut said they were unable to
battle the fires, which gutted several apartment buildings and
gasoline stations, because of water shortages.
   Police said Syrian gunners blasted Aoun's presidential palace in
suburban Baabda east of Beirut with rockets and that Aoun was in
the underground bunker of the two-story building.
   Several shells exploded around the office of Syrian-backed
acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss. Officials said Hoss was at his
home about a mile away from his office.
   Aoun heads a Christian military Cabinet vying for legitimacy
with Hoss' Syrian-backed Moslem government.
   Shells also hit near the buildings housing The Associated Press,
United Press International, Reuters and the Agence France-Presse
news agencies near west Beirut's Hamra commercial thoroughfare.
There were no casualties among journalists.
   ``Yes, Lebanon does possess Frog-7 missiles supplied by Iraq,''
Hikmat Awad, Lebanon's ambassador to Iraq, was quoted as saying in
the conservative Beirut newspaper Al-Anwar.
   ``Lebanon has much more sophisticated weapons which, if
revealed, will make everyone forget about the Frog-7s,'' Awad was
quoted as saying. He did not elaborate.
   Awad's confirmation was the first by a Lebanese Christian
official that Aoun's forces have Frog-7s, which can hit the Syrian
capital of Damascus about 40 miles away if fired from Lebanon's
central mountains in the Christian enclave.
   The report said Awad spoke when he arrived in Christian east
Beirut Saturday for talks with Aoun.
   Syria and Iraq are governed by bitterly competitive wings of the
Arab Socialist Baath Party.
   Aoun has vowed a ``war of liberation'' to drive out 40,000
Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping
mandate from the Arab League.
   It was not immediately clear why Awad would confirm the presence
of Frog-7 missiles when Aoun has not. The state-run Iraqi media has
previously said that Frog-7 missiles had been sent to Aoun's army.
   Awad did not say how many of the missiles Aoun has. The missile
has a range of about 43 miles and carries a warhead of 1,200 pounds
of high explosives.
   The Syrians have been demanding the removal of the Frog-7s from
the Christian side as a precondition for a cease-fire and lifting
of their land and sea blockade of the Christian enclave.
   Syrian gunboats have been searching ships, and Syrian artillery
has been shelling the coast to prevent supplies from landing at the
enclave.
   Intransigence on both sides has stymied peacemaking efforts by
an Arab League summit committee made up of King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algerian President Chadli
Bendjedid.
   Their foreign ministers met in Rabat, Morocco, on Saturday to
discuss new ways to stop the fighting in Lebanon.
   Police estimate more than one million residents have fled Beirut
since March, turning what was once the most glamorous capital in
the Middle East into a virtual ghost city.

   Business has been slower than usual
this summer at many East Coast beaches, but bad weather apparently
is doing more to keep tourists away than the threat of pollution.
   For the past two summers, reports of washed-up medical waste,
floating garbage and high counts of fecal coliform bacteria scared
tens of thousands of tourists away.
   To restore public confidence _ and protect the tourist-dependent
economies of beach communities _ some states have undertaken
massive weekly ocean water testing programs. Better information
about the actual danger, or lack of danger, from pollution also has
helped, some say.
   ``People are not panicking as much because they're more
informed,'' said Noreen Bodman, director of the New Jersey Division
of Travel and Tourism. ``They also know we're doing all we can to
keep the beaches clean and safe.''
   Preliminary figures from Virginia Beach, Va., show tourism was
down 7 percent in June from last year, but officials there are
blaming the weather.
   In Rhode Island, a cool and rainy period in early July also
caused the number of tourists to drop, say tourism officials.
   In Rehoboth Beach, Del., tourism has fluctuated because of bad
weather, said city manager Gregory Ferrese.
   ``I think the day trippers have decreased dramatically because
of the weather conditions,'' Ferrese said.
   On the other hand, Jones Beach on New York's Long Island has
experienced one of the East Coast's most dramatic increases in
beachgoers. Between July 7 and July 26 last year, 635,000 people
used the beach, but that number rose to 1.1 million during the same
period this year.
   At Rehoboth, hotel and motel reservations for August are
promising, Ferrese said. In New Jersey, Ms. Bodman predicted strong
end-of-summer turnout.
   Environmental reports suggest that bacteria contamination has
closed back bays more often than ocean beaches, largely because
bays are often catch basins for storm runoff.
   However, ocean beaches have not been spared.
   Earlier this month, 13 beaches in Cape May County in southern
New Jersey _ including all beaches in the popular town of Wildwood
_ were plagued for several days by high bacteria counts after heavy
rains that caused storm sewers to overflow.
   But tourists did not stay away. Tourism experts point to
educational campaigns that have taught the public what is dangerous
waste and what is not.
   Storm water runoff, for instance, is a natural phenomenon that
usually dissipates quickly.
   Syringes have been found on beaches in several states this year,
but haven't prompted instant beach closures as in past years.
   One New York official blamed the media for scaring tourists away
from Long Island beaches by reporting on medical debris that washed
ashore.
   ``People were frightened about something they didn't know
anything about,'' said Joseph Lescinski, superintendent of Jones
Beach State Park.
   One episode demonstrated the importance of tourist revenue to
beach communities. A group of merchants dropped chlorine tablets in
the ocean off Cape May County in a futile attempt to kill bacteria.
   Other communities have mounted organized efforts.
   In Long Island, and New Jersey, helicopters are used for daily
patrols of the waters. New York Harbor gets special attention to
help target shore-bound garbage slicks so they can be swept up
before they reach the beaches.
   Since January, New York City has covered its garbage barges with
netting to hold down the 14,000 tons of debris barged daily to a
dump on Staten Island.

   It had been 20 years since Jenny and Ted
attended a school for the blind in a small Massachusetts town, but
his voice on the radio was unmistakable and the two have been
reunited.
   Edwin Henry McCaw, 43, and Jeannette Gates, 40, were married
Saturday after they got in touch again through the radio show McCaw
has conducted since 1976.
   ``I knew from friends that he worked at a South Shore radio
station, but I didn't think I would be able to hear it from where I
lived,'' said Gates, who lives in Beverly.
   When in 1986 she heard a radio voice like McCaw's, she called
the station, but there was no answer. The following week, she
called the station with a request for: ``Please Don't Leave Me'' by
Fats Domino.
   ``Well, one thing led to another and I started sending out songs
to Jenny in Beverly,'' McCaw said. ``One night, the phone rang and
it was Jenny. She said, `Ted, we need to do some serious talking.'
''
   The couple married Saturday in the Open Door Church of God here
and rode off in the rumble seat of a 1934 Ford to a reception in
Hanson, their hometown.
   McCaw graduated from the Perkins School for the Blind in
Watertown in 1966 and went to work as a mechanic helping to restore
old buses. Every Sunday night he broadcasts a 1950s music program,
``Off the Wall,'' for WADT-FM in Marshfield.
   Mrs. McCaw, who was divorced after an eight-year marriage to a
partly-blind musician, has worked for the Morgan Memorial Goodwill
Industries and for the Chubb Insurance Group in Boston.
   ``I remember when I was in the sixth grade and Jen was in the
fourth,'' McCaw said. ``She'd cry and I'd pick her up and carry her
on my shoulder all over the school.
   ``I was late for class a lot,'' he said.

   The Supreme Court on Sunday restricted the
army's right to demolish homes of Palestinians suspected of
involvement in the uprising in the occupied lands.
   In its strongest move to limit army powers in the 19-month-old
rebellion, the court said the military must allow appeals before
destroying houses, a practice that has been denounced by the United
States and other Western nations and human rights groups.
   In the occupied West Bank, soldiers shot to death a 17-year-old
Palestinian, the army and Arab reporters said. In the occupied Gaza
Strip, an Israeli settler shot and killed a Palestinian
stone-thrower after Arabs barraged his car with stones, a police
spokesman said.
   Two other Arabs died of wounds suffered in earlier clashes with
soldiers, hospital officials said.
   Police also arrested eight Israelis on suspicion of fomenting
rebellion as members of the Free State of Judea movement, which
calls for founding a Jewish nation in the West Bank.
   The 18-page Supreme Court ruling was in response to an appeal by
the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.
   The three-member court ordered the army to inform owners of
houses slated for demolition that they could appeal to a military
commander and the Supreme Court.
   It said that in some cases, a house may be sealed before the
appeal hearing, ``as opposed to demolition, which is irreversible.''
   Presiding Judge Meir Shamgar also said the army has the right to
immediately demolish a house in case of ``operational military
needs,'' such as in combat.
   A military spokesman said 227 houses have been demolished in the
occupied territories during the uprising. Palestinian groups say
the number is higher.
   The U.S. State Department in February said the demolitions
violated the Geneva Conventions on human rights and ignored due
process because suspects' houses were torn down before they were
tried.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry responded by saying the measure was
used ``only in very exceptional circumstances as dictated by
compelling security requirements.''
   In court arguments, the state prosecutor's office and the army
said an appeal period is granted automatically according to army
policy, except in ``serious and exceptional cases'' that involve
fatalities or injuries.
   Justice Minister Dan Meridor said in an army radio interview
that there was no reason to change the law. ``We are talking about
the use of emergency regulations,'' he said.
   The civil rights association applauded the decision of the
court, which in the past has rejected a number of individual
appeals involving house demolitions.
   ``Our association has always believed that the drastic step of
demolition of houses ... is a form of collective punishment which
is not justified,'' said David Presler, a member of the
association, on Israel radio.
   ``However, from the legal point of view, the maximum we could do
... was to guarantee the procedural rights of people whose houses
were about to be demolished.''
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, at least 525
Palestinians have been killed in clashes with army troops and
Israeli settlers in the occupied lands. Thirty-eight Israelis have
died.
   In addition, Palestinians have killed 85 fellow Arabs accused of
collaborating with Israel during the uprising.
   The army and Palestinian sources gave conflicting reports on the
death Sunday of Iyad Abdullah Abdel Qader, the 17-year-old killed
in the West Bank village of Ras Karka. The army said he was shot by
soldiers who opened fire on stone-throwing youths along a highway.
   Villagers told Arab reporters Abdel Qader was shot in the head
at close range by soldiers who sneaked into the village Saturday
and opened fire without warning.
   In the second incident, a settler opened fire with a pistol
after his car was stoned as it passed the Arab town of Beit Hanun,
Gaza police spokesman Yigal Golan said. A 25-year-old Arab resident
was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he died on arrival, Golan
said. He would not release the victim's name.
   Police identified the settler as David Shtibi from the Gaza
Strip Jewish settlement of Rafah Yam.
   At least 2,500 Jewish settlers live surrounded by almost 800,000
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
   Also Sunday, Farouk Ata, 25, a resident of the West Bank's
Tulkarem refugee camp, died of wounds suffered last week in a clash
with troops, hospital officials said.
   Ahmad Fattah Ghaleb, 18, died in a Ramallah hospital Sunday from
stomach wounds suffered in a clash with soldiers in the West Bank
village of Beit Lid, hospital officials said. The army confirmed
his death.

<HEAD>Simon Calls for Economic Sanctions Against China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and other nations should impose
economic sanctions against China for its violent suppression of the
pro-democracy movement, U.S. Sen. Paul Simon said Sunday.
   Simon, D-Ill., speaking during closing ceremonies of the First
Congress of Chinese Students in the United States, said the Bush
administration has followed the right direction in its response to
the violent crackdown on protesters, but now must take stronger
action.
   Simon said he was opposed to restrictions on food and medicine,
``but beyond that, we should be joining other nations and we should
be leading other nations to see that there are joint economic
sanctions so that the government of China feels very, very clearly
the economic muscle that we put on the side of freedom.''
   Simon congratulated the student group for reaching its main goal
_ the creation of a federation to coordinate the efforts of Chinese
students in the United States _ and pledged his help to bring
reforms to China's communist government.
   ``You and I have a mission, and that mission is to bring freedom
to all the people of China,'' Simon said, prompting loud applause
and cheering from many of the 400 conference delegates and
observers gathered in a conference hall at the Chicago campus of
the University of Illinois.
   During the three-day congress attended by students from 200
colleges and universities, delegates also established duties for
the new federation, including lobbying other governments for
support and publicizing their cause through demonstrations and
sponsorship of an independent newspaper in the United States.
   Several journalists from opposition newspapers based in Hong
Kong and Taiwan attended the closing ceremonies, along with eight
dissidents who participated in the April and June protests in
Beijing, conference organizers said. Neither the dissidents nor
journalists addressed the crowd Sunday.
   Speaking to reporters after his address, Simon said he and other
congressional leaders have met with Bush administration officials
to press for a greater response to the June killings of
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and the
continued suppression of their supporters.
   The Bush administration, while resisting calls for economic
sanctions, has cut off sales of military equipment, barred military
and other high-level visits and suspended U.S. support of
international bank loans.
   Simon said he understands the need for caution, but added,
``We're talking about a very clear-cut choice between oppression
and freedom and in that kind of a clear-cut choice I think we ought
to stand up.''
   Simon emphasized that the United States should maintain
relations with the Chinese government even while imposing sanctions.

   The suspect in a growing list of
possible arsenic poisonings is a 56-year-old retired grocery clerk
who once sang in the church choir and is the new wife of a
minister, authorities say.
   ``We're talking about an average, ordinary, neighborhood lady,''
said Alamance County Sheriff Richard Frye. ``If she had walked into
my office a couple of weeks ago, I would not have known her.''
   Blanche Taylor Moore is being held without bond, charged with
using arsenic to kill her first husband, James Taylor, in 1973, and
her boyfriend, Raymond Reid, in 1986.
   She also is charged with assault with intent to kill in the
arsenic poisoning of her present husband, the Rev. Dwight Moore,
still in a Greensboro hospital. On Thursday, the investigation
expanded to nine possible poisoning victims, eight of whom died.
   ``She told me this whole scenario is like a nightmare stalking
her,'' her attorney, Mitchell McEntire, said after visiting Mrs.
Moore in jail. ``It keeps stalking her.''
   ``The investigation is ongoing and it will continue as long as
police receive information,'' said District Attorney Steve Balog.
   Authorities were checking out every lead, the prosecutor said,
including tips from the public.
   ``This investigation is headed a long way from here,'' said
Burlington police Lt. Detective Steve Lynch.
   On Friday, Dr. John Butts of the state medical examiner's office
said an autopsy on Mrs. Moore's father, Parker D. Kiser Sr., showed
he had ingested arsenic in the weeks before his 1966 death, but
that his death was actually caused by heart failure.
   Lynch said the investigation of Kiser's death remains open.
   ``No immediate charges are planned until the investigation is
complete and the district attorney has an opportunity to evaluate
the case,'' he said Friday.
   Mrs. Moore has not been charged in any of the new investigations.
   ``In no way are we implying that these people were murdered,''
Lynch said. ``But as a result of some phone calls, we began to have
some unanswered questions.''
   Mrs. Moore is scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 28 on the murder
and assault charges.
   ``She's a good Christian lady who has lived her whole life
quietly,'' said her attorney. ``Now people are pointing fingers at
her.''
   Police began investigating Mrs. Moore after Moore was admitted
to North Carolina Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hill in May shortly
after their honeymoon with an illness diagnosed as arsenic
poisoning.
   The probe raised questions about four deaths of people linked
with Mrs. Moore. They included her father, Taylor, Reid and a
former co-worker, Mabel Jessie Parsons.
   The bodies of Taylor, Reid and Kiser were exhumed for autopsies.
   On Wednesday, Lynch sent to Butts the medical records of Mrs.
Parsons, 61, and three more possible victims: Joseph M. Mitchell,
57, also a co-worker; Ina P. Vinson, a retired Southern Bell
employee, and John W. Reiber, 77.
   On Thursday, the list of possible victims grew to nine with the
addition of Mrs. Moore's mother-in-law, Isla Taylor.
   Mrs. Moore, who declined a request for an interview, maintains
through her attorney that she is innocent.
   The events of the last few weeks have sent a shock wave through
the mill village of Carolina, on the outskirts of Burlington, where
Mrs. Moore lived briefly with her new husband prior to his
hospitalization May 7.
   ``Nobody, nobody suspected anything,'' said Wayne Hackney, who
operates a small grocery store and gas pump near the 130-member
Carolina United Church of Christ, where Moore began preaching five
years ago.
   ``The man didn't have any money. He's just a preacher,'' said
Larry Johnson, one of Hackney's customers.
   Another customer who declined to give his name said: ``I'd hate
to be in her shoes if I did it or not.''
   McEntire said he asked Mrs. Moore whether she had anything to do
with the cases in which she is charged.
   ``She said if the evidence is that they died of arsenic
poisoning, they either ingested it accidentally or someone did it
in a fashion to make it appear she did it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Acclaimed violinist Eugene Fodor Jr. was
jailed after a judge refused to accept his 300-year-old violin to
guarantee bail on charges he broke into a motel room on Martha's
Vineyard.
   Fodor, who has performed internationally and at the White House,
was held over the weekend on breaking-and-entering and cocaine
possession charges after being arrested Thursday in a motel room,
said Tisbury Police Sgt. Justin Welch. On Friday, an Edgartown
District judge set bail at $50,000 and refused to accept the violin.
   Fodor, 39, is a native of Denver who lives in New York City. He
gained fame in 1974 when he became the first American to share top
honors at the Tchaikovsky violin competition in Moscow, and he has
recorded for RCA.
   The violinist's father said he did not have any warning that his
son may be in trouble until he learned of the arrest.
   ``The first I knew about it was when I read today's paper,''
Eugene Fodor Sr. of Morrison, a Denver suburb, said Saturday. Fodor
planned to travel to Edgartown, Mass., to attend his son's court
appearance.
   Fodor's ex-wife, Susan Davis of Vienna, Va., said she was
stunned to learn about Fodor's arrest and his attempt to use the
violin as surety for bond.
   Davis, who was married to Fodor between 1978 and 1985, said
Fodor contacted her early Friday ``because he wanted me to know
what was going on.''
   ``He sounded very frightened and said he didn't have much time
to talk,'' Davis said.
   A family member in Manhattan, who spoke Sunday on condition of
anonymity, said the incident likely stems from Fodor's recent drug
problem, which may be rooted in the very ferocity that fires the
violinist's creativity and craft.
   ``The only explanation I can think of is that he does everything
in a thorough way,'' she said. ``He's a genius in his work and he
devotes all his energy to his work. He's very intense in whatever
he does.''
   Hotel maids making early morning rounds noticed someone in a
room that was listed as unoccupied, said a manager at the Vineyard
Harbor Motel who declined to give his name. When they asked where
he came from he slammed the door. Motel workers called police and
Fodor was arrested.
   Fodor was arraigned Friday on Martha's Vineyard on charges of
breaking and entering in the night with intent to commit a felony;
trafficking in cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute; possession of a hypodermic needle; possession of
heroin; and possession of a dangerous weapon _ a dagger, police
said.

   A lightning strike at a softball park
Sunday injured three people, including a man who had been talking
on a telephone in a concession stand, authorities said.
   ``We think it struck the metal backstop behind the
ballplayers,'' said Capt. Robert Pippin of the Sedgwick County
Emergency Medical Service.
   Gary Cunningham, 33, Alan Wray, 27, and Grant Black, 27, were
listed in fair condition Sunday evening at St. Francis Regional
Medical Center, said Jo Wescott, a nursing supervisor. All three
are from Wichita.
   No one was directly hit by the lighting, but ``the impact and
disbursement of the energy knocked several people off their feet
and to the ground,'' said Alan Green, a paramedic with the Wichita
Fire Department. ``It took them a minute to realize what happened.''
   It was partly cloudy at the time of the strike.

   The governors of six Mid-Atlantic states signed
an agreement Sunday pledging regional cooperation and planning in
the battle against drugs.
   The governors of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Virginia and West Virginia signed a ``Middle Atlantic Governor's
Compact on Drug and Alcohol Abuse'' at a meeting during the
National Governors' Conference.
   The agreement says the states will share information and
strategic planning on drugs and alcohol, develop coordinated drug
education programs, and, ``where possible'' establish uniform drug
laws.
   ``We know that drug dealers don't care about state borders, and
neither should we when it comes to setting goals and strategy'' in
fighting drugs, said Gov. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania. ``If we try
to solve these problems alone, state by state, it's going to be
extremely difficult.''

<HEAD>Gov't Abolishes Rationing of Meat, Ends Most Price Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to UPDATE with Rakowski comments; pickup
12th graf pvs, `Meat ration...' ^By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Sunday announced the end
of food price controls and meat rationing, despite warnings from
Solidarity and from a Politburo member that the move could lead to
huge price increases and unrest.
   The announcement to go forward with former Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski's controversial plan came one day after he
was elected Communist Party chief to replace Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, who stepped down after being elected president.
   The plan, which takes effect Tuesday, abolishes a seven-year
rationing program for meat.
   It has been called ill-prepared by the Solidarity trade union
and by Politburo member Wladyslaw Baka. He quit as party secretary
in charge of economic policy during the two-day party meeting that
ended Saturday after Rakowski's election.
   ``We cannot take responsibility for the social results of the
operation being introduced by the government,'' Solidarity's
national executive commission said in a statement. ``There is a
danger of outbreak of social dissatisfaction.''
   In his first public comment on the elevation of Rakowski,
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told supporters outside St. Brygida's
Roman Catholic Church in Gdansk he was ``not going to get involved
in party matters. ... I did not choose him, party members chose
him.''
   Stanislaw Debinski, a Solidarity representative for Wroclaw,
said Rakowski ``did more harm in nine months (as prime minister)
than the other governments did in 40 years. He is a guy who has the
idea of maintaining the hard-liners in power. That's why he was
elected.''
   Although Rakowski supports a radical restructuring of the
economy, he acknowledges he is linked more with the party's
conservative elements than its reformist wing.
   One of his first acts after becoming prime minister was to close
the Lenin Shipyard, where Solidarity was founded nine years ago. He
also played a major role in defending the suppression of the union
after the introduction of martial law Dec. 13, 1981.
   Rakowski, in the closing speech Saturday to the meeting of the
Communist Party's Central Committee, said the party is not looking
for a quarrel with the Solidarity-led opposition,``but we will
fight back if provoked.''
   The official PAP news agency published on Sunday the text of his
speech.
   ``We do not have to drop down to our knees in front of our
political opponent,'' Rakowski said. ``We do not have to behave
like a rabbit paralyzed by fear.''
   ``We are interested in real, constructive cooperation'' with the
opposition, he said, ``but if such constructive cooperation does
not come about, the nation soon will see who it can really trust.''
   Rakowski has been widely criticized for his handling of the
economy during his time in office. Inflation is in triple digits,
and many basic food supplies are in short supply.
   PAP said that under the new food program, stores will be allowed
to buy meat directly from farmers starting Tuesday for whatever
price they can negotiate, ending an administrative price system and
a system of official meat-buying points.
   Meat ration coupons, which since 1981 allowed each family member
to buy five pounds of meat monthly from state-owned shops at
controlled prices, will be abolished, the announcement said.
Consumers always could buy additional meat at higher prices from
private stores, but it was too expensive for many people.
   Rakowski has said farmers are withholding meat and grain from
markets because the prices they get are insufficient. He says the
only way to pay them more to bring adequate supplies in stores is
to charge consumers more.
   The only food items whose prices will still be controlled are
bread, low-fat milk, cottage cheese and milk formulas for infants,
the announcement said.
   The program contains ``some money'' to compensate consumers for
the higher prices, but not enough to make up for the price
increases, PAP said. It said details would be published Tuesday.
   Baka warned that food prices could triple or quadruple under the
program. He said those increases could lead to renewed wage demands
unless precautions were taken before the operation, such as
stockpiling reserves to counter panic buying and help people on
fixed incomes.
   ``The present government's overwhelming desire to introduce
market mechanisms regardless of real conditions has been one of the
most important factors aggravating the economic as well as social
sitiuation,'' a party commission led by Baka reported last week.
   ``If the present line is continued, the economy may eventually
collapse, which will turn society against the idea of reforming the
economy to make it more market-governed.''
   Jaruzelski was expected to present his choice for a new prime
minister Monday for approval by the Parliament.
   At the time of Rakowski's election, two regional party leaders
regarded as hard-liners were named to the ruling Politburo, as was
a 43-year-old party secretary known as a reformer. Four veteran
Politburo members resigned.
   It appeared that Rakowski was attempting to balance various
party factions within the Politburo. Before his election, he had
appealed in an interview for party unity. He stressed the party
must be pragmatic without losing sight of its Marxist origins and
must become a party capable of winning elections.
   In Poland's freest elections in more than four decades last
month, the revived Solidarity movement won 260 out of the 261 seats
it was allowed to contest, prompting the party to explore how it
can start to rebuild public support.

<TEXT>
   Britain said Sunday it will resume talks with
China in September over the future of Hong Kong, a British colony.
   The talks will be the first formal contact between China and
Britain since the violent military crackdown in June on China's
pro-democracy movement.
   Plans for resuming talks were announced following a meeting
between Foreign Secretary John Major and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen of China in Paris. Both are in Paris for an international
peace conference on Cambodia.
   A Foreign Office spokesman in London said Major and Qian agreed
that a joint liaison group working out details of procedures for
handing the colony over to China in 1997 will meet in London at the
end of September and again before the end of the year.
   Many of Hong Kong's 5.7 million inhabitants have become
increasingly fearful about their future since China began its
crackdown on dissent.
   Some Hong Kong politicians have accused Britain of abandoning
the people of Hong Kong by refusing to grant automatic residence
rights to the 3 million British passport holders in the colony.
   Under a 1984 Chinese-British agreement, Hong Kong is to retain
its capitalist economy for 50 years.
   Major said after Sunday's meeting: ``For the time being the
Chinese foreign minister is in no doubt about our concern about the
need to restore confidence in Hong Kong.''

   Ramon Areces, founder and president of
Spain's largest department store chain, died of a heart attack in a
Madrid hospital Sunday. He was 83 years old.
   The son of peasants, Areces began his career in Havana and later
created Spain's biggest retail empire, El Corte Ingles, which had
sales last year of $4.7 billion.
   He was born Sept. 15, 1905, at Grado, a village in the northern
Asturias region.
   He went to Havana when he was 15 and worked as a store errand
boy. In 1925 he moved to Canada and graduated from Montreal
University, where he studied economic sciences.
   In 1936, he bought a small clothing store in Madrid that formed
the base for what is now a chain of 18 department stores throughout
Spain.
   The Spanish news media has estimated that Areces, a widower with
no children, had a personal wealth of more than $2.5 billion.
   A spokesman for El Corte Ingles said a burial service will be
held Monday at San Gines church in Madrid.

   Delegates at the ruling party's

references to Marxism and calls for less state control of the
economy.
   It also says some educational, health and housing services
should be turned over to the private sector.
   The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, came to
power in 1975 when Mozambique gained independence from Portugal and
established one-party rule in a Marxist-Leninst state.
   President Joaquim Chissano said at the beginning of the
week-long congress that Frelimo remains committed to socialism but
should ``express the aspirations of the entire people.''
   The party's new platform removes all references to ``class
struggle'' and Western imperialism. Mozambique has improved
relations with Western countries, which provide substantial aid for
the nation and its 15 million people.

   U.S. District Judge John D. Holschuh was to decide Monday

   For more than a month, Rose's legal actions have kept the
commissioner from deciding whether Rose bet on his own team _ an
offense that carries a possible lifetime ban. The question of which
court hears Rose's case is pivotal.
   Baseball wants the case in federal court, where judges
previously have upheld the sweeping powers of the commissioner.
Rose wants it kept in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court, where
Judge Norbert A. Nadel has shown willingness to set precedents in
his decisions.
   To keep the case in state court, Holschuh must rule that the
dispute is between two entities that reside or do business in Ohio.
That would involve one of two findings: that the case technically
is between Rose and the Reds, an Ohio team; or that major league
baseball is an unincorporated association doing business in Ohio
through the Reds, thus subject to lawsuit in Ohio courts.
   However, if Holschuh decides the dispute technically is between
Rose and the commissioner of baseball, A. Bartlett Giamatti, who
lives in another state, then the federal courts could have domain.
   Rose has blocked Giamatti for more than a month from deciding
whether Rose bet on the Reds.
   The manager also has received protections from firing by the
team or suspension by Giamatti while the case is heard. The
protections extend for three days after Holschuh's decision.
   While lawyers for Rose and Giamatti have exchanged voluminous
and sometimes sharply worded legal arguments, the ballclub has kept
a low profile.
   The Reds filed papers with Holschuh saying they were maintaining
a strict neutrality. Owner Marge Schott has declined to make public
statements about the case while it is in court, but admits she's
unhappy it has dragged on so long.
   And general manager Murray Cook says there's no thought being
given to asking the courts for authority to remove Rose if the case
lasts beyond this season.
   ``I don't know that we can,'' Cook said. ``We're not lawyers. We
just have to go by what the lawyers dictate at this time.''

<HEAD>Three Convicted of Racketeering in Case Stemming from Venditti Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three reputed mobsters were convicted Sunday of
federal racketeering charges stemming from the killing of a police
officer in 1986.
   Frederico Giovanelli, 56, Steven Maltese, 57, and Carmine
Gualtiere, 55, were found guilty of violating the federal
racketeering statute, loansharking, interstate travel in aid of a
racketeering enterprise, and attempted murder.
   The verdict came on the fifth day of deliberations following an
11-week trial. The defendants were remanded to the Metropolitan
Correctional Center.
   The three men are associated with the Genovese crime family,
said U.S. Attorney Benito Romano.
   Gualtiere was described as a soldier who ran a huge gambling
business that brought in hundreds of thousands dollars in revenue
to him and the Genovese family, prosecutors said.
   Detective Anthony Venditti, member of an organized crime task
force, was shot to death outside a diner in the Ridgewood district
of Queens on Jan. 21, 1986, during mob surveillance. His partner,
Kathleen Burke, was wounded when she tried to assist Venditti.
   Romano said the defendants did not know Venditti was a police
officer and were afraid they were going to be ``ripped off.''
   Gualtiere was acquitted of murder charges in state court in
April 1988. The jury deadlocked in the case of the two others and a
mistrial was declared, the second in the case.
   Questions arose as to whether Sunday's conviction would
interfere with the state's effort to re-prosecute the defendants on
homicide charges due to the double jeopardy law. Romano said that
would be decided by the state courts.
   Giovanelli faces up to 70 years in prison, Maltese faces 75
years and Gualtiere faces 50 years. Each could be fined in excess
of $1 million. Sentencing was scheduled for Oct. 18, Romano said.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greek Orthodox bishop and a priest were
freed Sunday after being seized July 19 by Turkish-Cypriot police
during a protest in the United Nations buffer zone in the divided
city.
   Bishop Chrysostomos of Larnaca and the Rev. Giorgos Chrysostomou
were the last to be released of 108 Greek Cypriots arrested during
the demonstration marking the anniversary of the 1974 Turkish
invasion of Cyprus.
   Eight men were freed Friday and 98 women were released earlier
in the week.
   The clergymen, turned over to U.N. soldiers by the Turkish
Cypriots, went to the center of Nicosia where several hundred Greek
Cypriots welcomed them with patriotic songs.
   ``We will continue the struggle (for unity) but peacefully,''
the bishop said. ``I believe the Turkish Cypriots want to live in
peace with us.''
   The July 19 demonstration and detentions increased sectarian
tensions and delayed talks between Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot
leaders on reuniting the island.
   Cyprus has been partitioned since Turkey invaded the northern
third of the island after a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots
wanting union with Greece.
   The Turkish Cypriots, who make up 17 percent of the population,
declared their own republic in 1983 but only Turkey has recognized
it.
   The clergymen were arrested by Turkish-Cypriot police who
entered a church on the green line dividing Nicosia as a memorial
service was being held for people killed or missing in the invasion.
   On July 22, the bishop and priest were each sentenced to three
days in jail and fined $200 on charges of llegally entering the
Turkish-Cypriot state.
   They refused to pay the fine and were ordered to serve an extra
10 days in prison.
   Turkish state radio said the two were released early because a
Greek-Cypriot businessman, who was not identified, paid their fines.
   Creek-Cypriot President George Vassiliou and Turkish-Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash had postponed a negotiating session set for
last Wednesday.
   They are expected to resume talks this week on a U.N. plan for
reuniting the island.
   The 2,300-member U.N. peacekeeping force patrols the 112-mile
buffer zone zigzagging across the island.

<HEAD>Capture Of Communists Destroys Opportunity For Peace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two prominent communists captured
last week were in the capital to promote new negotiations with the
government but their arrest ``destroys any opportunity for peace,''
rebels said Sunday.
   Satur Ocampo, suspected chairman of the National Democratic
Front, and his common-law wife, Carolina ``Bobbie'' Malay, were
arrested Thursday while driving along a residential street in
suburban Makati. President Corazon Aquino's government said their
capture was a major setback to the rebels.
   In a statement to news organizations Sunday, the Front said:
``The arrest of Satur and Bobbie comes at a time when the NDF is
offering a serious and bold proposal to the Aquino regime and to
the nation.''
   The Front referred to an offer to resume peace talks to end the
20-year-old insurgency if Mrs. Aquino agrees to close the six U.S.
military bases here in 1991.
   ``Despite great risks to their security, these two comrades left
the revolutionary bases in the countryside and went to the capital
to work on the NDF proposal,'' the statement said.
   The rebels said the government had disregarded the peace offer
and ``its eagerness to show off a prize catch to please its
imperialist master (the United States) overrides any concern for
peace and destroys any opportunity for peace.''
   The statement was signed by renegade rebel Antonio Zumel, who,
along with Ocampo and Ms. Malay, negotiated on behalf of the
insurgents during peace talks that broke down in January 1987.
Ocampo, Ms. Malay and other rebel leaders went underground in
February of that year after a two-month cease-fire expired.
   The Front is a coalition of 12 Marxist groups, including the
Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the New
Peoples Army. The military has said Ocampo served on the party's
central committee and its politburo.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to enter new peace talks unless the
rebels first agree to lay down their weapons. Last week, she said
the government had not received any formal offer from the Front to
resume peace talks.
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to say whether she will support
extending the lease on U.S. military bases after it expires in
1991. She is expected to visit the United States later this year
for preliminary discussions on a new base treaty.
   A treaty must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member
Philippine Senate, where opposition to the installations is strong.
   In its statement, the Front praised the Ocampos for their
``courage and steadfastness in the hands of the enemy'' and urged
them to continue promoting the rebels' peace proposal in prison.

<HEAD>Sovereignty Commission Records Show Owner of Black Newspaper Worked

<TEXT>
   The owner of Mississippi's leading black
newspaper in the 1960s worked for the segregationist Sovereignty
Commission, according to newly released records of the defunct
state agency.
   Percy Greene, who operated and edited the Jackson Advocate from
1938 until 1977, promoted the commission's views with telegrams,
letters, articles and speeches _ some prepared for him by
Commission Director Erle Johnston, the records state.
   A federal judge last week ordered the records of the commission,
which tried to thwart civil rights groups in the 1950s and 1960s,
be opened to the public. The judge barred the state from enforcing
a law making it a crime to disclose the records, which had been
sealed since 1977.
   The complete papers, in the archives of the McCain Graduate
Library at the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg,
were made available to The Clarion-Ledger on Friday in an agreement
with the attorney general. The papers cover Johnson's
administration from 1964 until 1968.
   Greene's efforts and payments made to him from 1964 until 1967
are outlined in commission records contained in the personal papers
of Gov. Paul B. Johnson Jr.
   A document dated Dec. 9, 1965, shows Johnston wrote remarks
about race relations in Mississippi for Greene to use during
national television news interviews while at a Los Angeles
newspaper rally.
   ``A lot has been said about the murder of three civil rights
workers in Neshoba County. There has been criticism that they have
never been tried in a state court for murder,'' reads the four-page
typewritten letter labeled ``Observations for Percy Greene.''
   Greene also was supposed to defend state officials who refused
to prosecute the case.
   ``The truth of the matter is that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation handled all of the interrogations and accumulated the
evidence,'' Johnston wrote in the document.
   Johnston also suggested that Greene criticize the U.S.
Department of Health, Education and Welfare for threatenting to cut
off funds to Mississippi public schools unless they desegregated.
   ``Such a decision would hurt the colored students more than the
white students,'' the letter reads.
   Greene founded the Advocate in 1938 and ran it until his death
in 1977.
   ``There was always suspicion that he was getting paid,'' said
Myrlie Evers, widow of Medgar Evers, the Mississippi NAACP field
secretary assassinated in 1963. ``I do recall, at one point, a
meeting held at our home where people were discussing Percy Greene
and what he was doing.''
   Charles Tisdale bought the paper in 1978 and is its publisher
and editor today.
   ``I have some of his correspondence to the Sovereignty
Commission. I'm not surprised at anything,'' Tisdale said Saturday
of Greene.
   The president of Mississippi's chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Aaron Henry of
Clarksdale, was a member of the newspaper's board of directors
during Tisdale's tenure.
   He said Greene wasn't secretive about working for the
Sovereignty Commission.
   The commission obtained subscriptions of the Advocate for public
schools, Henry said Saturday.
   ``Percy had his problems with integration, but Percy was a
strong advocate of voting rights,'' Henry said.
   The present-day Advocate is ``completely different'' from
Greene's era, Henry said.
   ``It's really the voice of civil rights for this state,'' he
said.

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frances Woodworth Wright, a Harvard
University astronomer who taught celestial navigation to U.S. Navy
officers, died Sunday of cancer. She was 92.
   During more than half a century of research and teaching,
Wright's studies ranged from investigating specks of cosmic dust
called spherules to calculating the brightness of galaxies and
developing systematic efforts to observe comets and meteors.
   But her special interest was celestial navigation, the guiding
of ships by the position of stars. Among her students were U.S.
Army engineers and Navy officers enrolled in special courses during
World War II. She also taught scores of Harvard undergraduates and
weekend sailors, and she wrote three books on sailing by the stars.
   Many of her students remained ``fanatically devoted'' to her,
sending her accounts of survivals and rescues achieved by her
techniques and gathering in Cambridge for an annual reunion to swap
sea tales, said James Cornell, spokesman for the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
   Born in Providence, R.I., Wright attended the Moses Brown School
there and earned a bachelor's degree from Pembroke College in 1919
and a master's degree from Brown University in 1920. She taught
astronomy and mathematics at Elmira College in New York before
going to Harvard in 1928 to serve as an assistant to a succession
of prominent astronomers, including Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin,
Harlow Shapley and Fred Whipple.
   At the same time, she pursued her own studies and earned a
doctorate in astronomy from Radcliffe College in 1958, nearly 50
years after receiving her undergraduate degree. In 1959, she joined
the staff of the Harvard College Observatory. After retiring in
1971, she became a lecturer on navigation at Harvard and continued
to teach and do research until two years ago.
   Her memoirs, ``Constant Vigilance,'' were published in 1987.
   Wright, who lived in Cambridge and never married, leaves no
immediate survivors. Funeral services will be private.

   Parliament's lower chamber gave Premier Giulio
Andreotti's government a vote of confidence on Sunday, formally
ending a two-month-long political crisis.
   The Chamber of Deputies approved the five-party coalition by a
vote of 371 to 200, with three abstentions. On Thursday, the Senate
voted 187 to 117, with one abstention, in favor of the government.
   Andreotti, premier for the sixth time, leads a coalition
dominated by his Christian Democrats, Italy's largest party. The
Socialists are the linchpin in the coalition. The other, much
smaller parties are the Republicans, Liberals and Social Democrats.
   The same five-party grouping has been the government formula for
most of the decade, as it was for the former premier, Christian
Democrat Ciriaco De Mita. His coalition government fell apart on
May 19 after persistent sniping by the Socialists, who are led by
De Mita's arch rival, Bettino Craxi.
   Members of the Chamber of Deputies from the five parties voted
in favor of Andreotti's coalition in the unusual Sunday session.
The Communists, Italy's second-largest party, led the dissent.
   Andreotti has said his coalition must act quickly to stem a
budget deficit and make Italy more efficient so it can compete in
the integrated European market, set for 1992.
   Among his priorities is increasing revenues, especially by
cracking down on rampant tax evasion.

   Cecil Moores, a multimillionaire who operated the
Littlewoods lottery on soccer pools, died while on vacation in
Scotland, his family reported Sunday. He was 86.
   The family said he died Saturday but did not give the cause of
death.
   Moores was one of Britain's wealthiest men but lived modestly.
He was known to support charities in Liverpool's Merseyside
district where he was born.
   His brother, Sir John Moores, 83, founded the Littlewoods
lottery in 1924 with people betting on the results of weekly soccer
matches.
   Starting with 35 clients, the family built the business into
Britain's larges lottery-pools operation.
   It now has 5,000 employees and an annual income of about $800
million. The firm has said it will pay a top prize of $2.4 million
during the next soccer season.
   Cecil Moores took charge of the Littlewoods business in 1932
when his brother developed mail-order interests and later a chain
of stores.
   The brothers were the sons of a bricklayer and both started out
as printers.
   Cecil Moores was a soccer player in his youth and a lifelong
suporter of the Everton and Liverpool clubs in the English League's
first division.
   His wife died last year. He is survived by a son and daughter.

   Two small airplanes collided in flight
Sunday and seven people were killed, moments after one of the
planes had dropped skydivers at an airport festival, authorities
said. One person on the ground was injured.
   The planes collided about a mile southwest of Queen City
Airport, which was hosting a hot-air ballon festival, said Bill
Vogel, area supervisor for the Federal Aviation Administration.
   The planes crashed near a shopping mall.
   ``They were flying one over the other, then one flew up and hit
the other,'' said Frank Kosh, a Salisbury Township resident who saw
the collision.
   A mall employee said the planes ``must have been real low
because I could hear the collision in here.''
   ``It was like a loud car collision _ metal to metal,'' said Gary
Wertman, 45, of Allentown, who was working at Hess's Auto Center in
the South Mall.
   ``I looked out the window and I could see the tail section hit
the ground,'' Wertman said.
   He said one plane landed at the edge of the mall's parking lot,
about 10 feet from the building. No cars were nearby. The other
plane landed about 1,000 feet away, behind a car dealership across
the street, he said.
   FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said the plane that carried the
parachutists was missing its left wing when it hit the ground.
Airport spokeswoman Joan Wildman identified the craft as a Cessna
182.
   Police said the planes were heading to the airport and the one
that dropped the parachutists had taken off from there.
   The four parachutists landed safely, officials said. One man on
the ground suffered minor injuries when his car was struck by
debris, but he did not require hospitalization, Salisbury Township
police said.
   Lehigh County Coroner Wayne identified the pilot of the
parachutists's plane as Peter C. Miller, 47, of Sellersville.
Miller was the only one on board after the parachuters jumped.
   The pilot of the other plane was identified as Dr. Abdul Kahn,
43, of Allentown. Also on board were Dr. Muhammad A. Malik, 45, of
Allentown, his 12-year-old son, Raymond Malik, two other adults and
a child, said Synder, who withheld the last three victims' names.
   The festival involved 40 to 45 hot-air balloons and numerous
food and concessions stands, said Wildman. No balloons were in the
air at the time of the collision, she said.

<HEAD>London's Financial District Rocked Again By Stock Shenanigans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major stock scandal involving Britain's biggest
bank is rocking the City of London, prompting demands for tougher
policing of one of Europe's most important financial districts.
   The controversy, known as the Blue Arrow affair, has led to the
reluctant resignation of the chairman of the bank, National
Westminster PLC, and the abrupt departure of eight other people
from a variety of posts in the City.
   Chairman Lord Boardman protested that senior bank officials who
weren't directly involved have been unfairly singled out. But the
affair has damaged the bank's blue-chip reputation and perhaps its
expansion into investment banking.
   An official report severely criticizing the conduct of Natwest
officials in the 1987 sale of shares in Blue Arrow PLC, an
employment services agency, reflected a government move to crack
down on financial shenanigans in Britain.
   The furor has also raised questions about the adequacy of the
country's self-regulatory framework set up after the October 1986
deregulation of the nation's financial markets, called the Big Bang.
   ``British style of leave it to an old boy network was all right
when the old boys had standards,'' said legislator John Smith,
financial affairs spokesman for the opposition Labor Party. ``We're
in a world of global finance now where these things are swept
aside. We need tough enforcement.''
   The Blue Arrow affair follows what is known as the Guinness
scandal, in which the giant brewer Guinness PLC admitted that its
former management arranged for third parties to buy Guinness stock.
   The intention apparently was to inflate the share price and make
Guinness' ultimately successful, 1986 cash-and-stock offer for the
liquor company Distillers Co. more attractive than a rival bid.
   Seven men, including Guinness' deposed chairman, Ernest
Saunders, are awaiting trial on criminal charges.
   ``I think it's very clear to me standards in the City have
fallen dreadfully,'' Smith said at a recent gathering of the
Association of American Correspondents in London. ``We've now got a
whole series of these things.''
   The latest controversy grew out of Blue Arrow's audacious $1.3
billion acquisition of the much larger Manpower Inc. of the United
States in 1987, creating the world's largest employment services
agency.
   The official report, issued July 20 by the Department of Trade
and Industry after a seven-month probe, criticized Natwest
officials over the unsuccessful 837 million pound, or about $1.4
billion, sale of Blue Arrow shares to raise funds for that takeover.
   County Natwest Ltd., a securities unit of Natwest, kept shares
that didn't sell, failing to disclose a holding of more than 9.5
percent for three months. The trade department found misconduct and
a breach of British laws requiring timely disclosure of a stake of
more than 5 percent.
   London Metropolitan police's Serious Fraud Office is considering
whether criminal charges should be brought.
   The Securities Association, a self-regulatory body, says it is
investigating the conduct of four firms and 24 individuals in the
case. The Bank of England also is looking into the affair.
   Boardman, Natwest's 70-year-old chairman, and three other
directors resigned July 25 after an emergency meeting of the board
of directors. In addition, five other people have left their City
posts due to the scandal.
   The British press reported that the central bank has pressed for
``an appropriate response.''
   ``There obviously is an element of government crackdown on the
City in this,'' said Tim Clarke, a banking analyst with the London
investment firm Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers. ``The government wants
to be seen as fairly hard on the City.''
   Boardman said he accepted ultimate responsibility for Natwest's
``serious failings.'' But he said he stepped down also because he
felt the report unjustly criticized the other three directors. He
himself was not singled out.
   The three were criticized for conduct that fell ``below that to
be expected from responsible senior executives.''
   ``Natwest has paid the price of inadequate supervision,'' the
Times of London wrote.
   Clarke said the affair underscores how difficult it is for banks
to move into the securities business, which was opened up to them
under Big Bang.
   It also underlines the difficulty in complying with the new,
complex regulations, he said. Investment firms also have complained
that they're expensive to follow.
   Smith, the Labor lawmaker, called for the establishment of a
government regulatory body modeled after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   The government has transferred the responsibility for regulating
the financial services industry to a 17-member Securities and
Investments Board, a new, non-government watchdog body with
statutory powers. The board has approved five self-regulatory
organizations, including the Securities Association.

<HEAD>Last American Maker of 16mm Movie Projectors Closes Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLAINVILLE, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last American maker of
16-millimeter movie projectors is calling it quits, a victim of
Japanese competition and the rise of videotape.
   Kalart Victor Corp., which makes movie projectors, educational
television products, audio visual and film editing equipment, plans
to close its plant Monday, said the company's president, Leonard J.
Quartin.
   Quartin said the 67-year-old company has struggled since the
early 1980s, when video cassette recorders and hand-held camcorders
became popular.
   The company's products _ halfway between the 35mm film used for
Hollywood movies and the 8mm film once popular for home movies _
were purchased mostly by schools, governments and businesses for
instructional use.
   Kalart Victor made projectors for every U.S. embasssy in the
world, and supplied some city school systems with projectors for
each classroom. The city of Los Angeles alone bought thousands of
projectors from the company, Quartin said.
   But the rise of VCRs meant that instructional films could be
shown on television, a much easier technology for teachers and
companies to use, Quartin said.
   ``The ease of using a cartridge or cassette far outweighs the
steps in making movies where you have to put reels on the
projector,'' Quartin said.
   ``The interest in VCRs created a decline in 16 millimeter
projectors and film,'' he said. ``Home movies have disappeared,
taken over by camcorders.''
   At its peak during the 1970s, Kalart Victor employed 250 people.
Recently, there have been less than 50 people working at the plant.
   Quartin said Kalart Victor is the last company in the United
States producing 16mm movie projectors. He said three Japanese
producers will now have the entire market _ albeit a small one _ to
themselves. Japanese companies also dominate the VCR market.
   As recently as 10 years ago, he said, there were five U.S.
companies making the projectors, which grew in popularity after
World War II.
   At one time, the industry produced 100,000 projectors per year;
the number has dwindled to about 15,000, Quartin said.
   ``The only reason to have 16 millimeter now is to use it for a
large audience,'' Quartin said, since it can be projected on a
large screen.

<HEAD>Striking Pilot's Father Seeking Disqualification of Eastern Examiner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney whose son is a striking Eastern
Airlines pilot contends that Eastern's court-appointed bankruptcy
examiner should be disqualified from the case because of an alleged
conflict of interest.
   The lawyer, Moreton Rolleston Jr., contends in a motion sent to
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York that examiner David I. Shapiro
``cannot be completely impartial'' in Eastern's restructuring
because Shapiro's son works for a law firm representing the airline.
   Shapiro said Friday that his son, James, a second-year law
student at Georgetown University, is working for the Washington
office of Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges, handling environmental cases. The
New York-based firm is representing Eastern, but the younger
Shapiro is not handling any aspect of the case, his father said.
   ``I asked everybody if there was an objection. There were
none,'' Shapiro said. ``If there had been, James would have taken
another offer.''
   Rolleston, whose daughter-in-law is a flight attendant also on
strike against Eastern, said Shapiro ``must be like Caesar's wife,
that is, not only within the law but above suspicion.''
   Shapiro took offense at Rolleston's remarks.
   ``I view it as an attempt to attack me through my son. I don't
like it,'' Shapiro said.
   One of Shapiro's tasks as examiner is to investigate allegations
by the striking unions that Texas Air Corp., parent firm of the
airline, has stripped away Eastern assets to benefit the parent
company and sister carrier Continental Airlines.
   Shapiro said Friday he does not expect to report his findings
until September.
   Rolleston said he sent the motion last week to U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, but as of Friday it had not been filed with the clerk. The
attorney made copies of the motion available Friday to reporters.
   This is the second time Rolleston has intervened in the Eastern
case. In April, he petitioned the bankruptcy court to appoint a
trustee to run the airline during the reorganization, claiming that
since he had earned mileage in Eastern's frequent flier program he
was a party to the case. The request was not granted.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge has approved the
appointment of an independent examiner to study alleged fraud at
Phoenix-based American Continental Corp., a troubled real estate
and savings and loan holding company.
   Judge Sarah Curley also said the examiner would study the merits
of the company's proposed reorganization plan.
   She said in a decision released Friday that she found no ``unity
of action'' to protect the interests of the bondholders, who sought
the appointment of an examiner.
   ``We can bring to light the facts and circumstances regarding
serious allegations,'' said Andrew Friedman, an attorney
representing a group of bondholders who are suing American
Continental in California.
   The bondholders allege that company insiders, including Chairman
Charles H Keating Jr., conspired to defraud investors.
   Mrs. Curley directed the bondholders' attorneys to meet with
officials of the U.S. Trustee's Office regarding the choice of an
examiner and the scope of the investigation. Friedman said he hopes
to report to the court within 10 days.
   Attorneys for American Continental opposed the appointment of an
examiner.
   The added burden of an examiner would ``push this debtor into
liquidation,'' Terese Mosher-Beluris, an attorney for American
Continental, said during hearings Thursday.
   On April 13, the company and 11 subsidiaries of Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association, its principal holding, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection. A day later, federal regulators took over
management of the $5.4 billion S&amp;L.
   James Feder, an attorney representing American Continental, said
he did not know whether American Continental would appeal Mrs.
Curley's decision.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has eliminated Ralston
Purina Co.'s right to continue to enforce a patent used for the
production of Purina Dog Chow.
   U.S. District Judge Michael Mihm ruled Thursday that in 1975,
St. Louis-based Ralston Purina fraudulently obtained the patent for
the process used to make soy protein, a prime ingredient of Purina
Dog Chow, attorney Terry Grimm said Friday.
   Ralston Purina said it planned to appeal.
   The cereal and pet food maker had filed a lawsuit against A.E.
Staley Manufacturing for violating its patent.
   In ruling against Ralston Purina, Mihm cited arguments of the
attorneys for Decatur, Ill.-based Staley that Purina did not
disclose information in a Dutch publication that explained a
similar process developed by food processor Archer Daniels Midland
Co.
   Grimm, the attorney for Staley, said that while the ruling does
not revoke Ralston Purina's patent, it does mean that the company
will no longer be able to sue those who use the process.
   Grimm said those seeking patents at the U.S. Patent Office have
an obligation to report any information they may have about items
or processes for which they seek patent rights.

<HEAD>Alpo To Enter Cat Food Market With Garfield</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Garfield is going to the dogs _ literally.
The feline cartoon character will help Alpo Petfoods Inc., better
known for its dog food, launch its new line of cat food.
   Alpo, the leading seller of premium canned dog food, will have
its Alpo brand cat food on supermarket shelves nationally in
November or early December, said Judi Kroeger, an Alpo spokeswoman.
   Garfield will proclaim on the label that the product is ``Good
Enough For Me.''
   The Allentown-based company, a division of the British
conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC, plans a multimillion-dollar
campaign to sell the product.
   ``We're really pleased that Jim Davis (Garfield's creator) has
worked with us since 1987 as the product was being developed,'' Ms.
Kroeger said. ``He's very particular about the items that Garfield
will endorse.''
   Ms. Kroeger said Alpo, which has researched and developed its
cat food for the last five years, believes it is financially
prudent to enter the market.
   ``The dog food market is limited in its business growth
potential because the dog population is declining, '' she said.
``The cat population is increasing, so cat food is one area that
companies can look to increase their business.''
   In 1983, Alpo bought the Tabby cat food company, which sells
only in the New England states. It followed by buying Blue Mountain
Co., which markets dog and cat food in the Northwest.
   Alpo commissioned a seven-member panel of veterinary and
nutrition experts to help develop the new cat food, Ms. Kroeger
said. The food was tested at Alpo and independent facilities.
   Its competition on the cat-food shelves will include Ralston
Purina Co.'s Purina brand and H.J. Heinz Co.'s 9-Lives.
   ``We know that these are strong brands and are not aiming to
overtake them by tomorrow afternoon,'' said Katherine A. Hillman,
Alpo's vice president for marketing. ``Garfield will certainly
assist in the initial trial, and the product's quality and
palatability will ensure strong repeat business.''
   In 1988, Alpo maintained its lead in the premium canned dog food
market by accounting for 28 percent of the estimated $920 million
market, according to Maxwell Consumer Report. The company also
advanced from fourth to second in dry dog food and dog snacks.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Great American Management and Investment
Inc., a financial services, manufacturing and chemical company, has
agreed to buy the Jepson Corp. for $221.3 million, officials said.
   Jepson, based in suburban Elmhurst, said Thursday that Chairman
and Chief Executive Robert S. Jepson Jr. and his family agreed to
sell their 12.7 million shares to a subsidiary of Great American,
headed by entrepreneur Sam Zell.
   The Jepson family shares represent 69.1 percent of the total,
and Zell said he would make a $12-a-share cash tender offer for the
other 5.7 million shares.
   Chicago-based Great American was attracted to ``the collection
of growing businesses that we felt could be improved upon and added
to,'' Zell said.
   Jepson has three main divisions: consumer products, such as
Hedstrom toys; commercial products, including Jepson Burns
commercial aircraft seats; and industrial products.
   Last summer, Robert Jepson said the company might seek a seller
to maximize shareholder value. The company went public in 1987,
with the stock selling initially at $13 a share, but has traded
considerably below that most of the time since.
   Jepson stock closed up 12{ cents at $11.75 Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

   An Australian company will build a $250

   Announcement of the plant by Gov. James Blanchard is expected

   The two-stroke engine, which is lighter, more powerful and
cleaner burning than conventional engines, was invented by Ralph
Sarich. His company, Orbital Engine Co. in Perth, Australia, has
signed licensing agreements with Ford Motor Co. and General Motors
Corp.
   The engine's pistons require two strokes to burn fuel instead of
the usual four.
   ``It is my understanding that the automakers are extremely
serious about this engine,'' said Robert Brooks, an industry
consultant in Waukegan, Ill.

<TEXT>
   The crippled tanker Exxon Valdez and flotilla
of escort boats entered San Diego Bay on Sunday, arriving for
repairs four months after spilling millions of gallons of oil into
Alaskan waters.
   Hundreds of people watched from shore as the ship, pushed by
tugboats, entered the bay and rounded North Island, passing
waterfront hotels and Navy warships. Harbor seals stared from atop
buoys.
   ``It's a wounded dinosaur,'' said Rick Nadeau of Greenpeace, the
environmental group, which sent boats out to check for oil in the
tanker's wake.
   Families with cameras jockeyed for the best shooting positions
with news photographers and television cameramen.
   Joggers and bicyclists joined the crowd that stretched about 500
feet along the shore to marvel at the high-riding vessel inscribed
with the name Exxon in bright red letters.
   Several people waved branches with feathers attached _ a silent
protest on behalf of the birds killed in Alaska's Prince William
Sound when the Exxon Valdez hit a reef and spilled 11 million
gallons of oil on March 24.
   A number of protesters hoisted signs that read: ``No Oil
Spilling, No Ocean Killing'' and ``End of the Exxploitation.''
   The strains of John Lennon's song, ``Imagine,'' were heard above
the drone of a Coast Guard helicopter hovering over the tanker.
   And as the tanker glided under the Coronado Bridge, the crowd
took on a carnival atmosphere. Vendors hawked $7 T-shirts that read
``American Wilderness: Love it or Leave it Alone'' and ``Oil
Profit$ Can't Buy Back the Environment.''
   The tugs pushed the ship to a pier at the National Steel and
Shipbuilding Co. for a nine-month, $25 million repair job, ending a
2,500-mile voyage from Alaska's and the nation's worst oil spill.
   Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg said no oil discharges were
spotted. At the pier, the tanker was encircled by a floating orange
containment boom.
   ``It ended today very quietly and we were pleased it ended
quietly,'' Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi told
reporters at the dock.
   Iarossi again denied the ship was the source of at least three
oil slicks off the coast, as charged by state Fish and Game
Department officials.
   ``I'm denying the Valdez spewed oil,'' he said. ``There was no
oil on that ship. People are losing sight of that fact.''
   He disclosed that Exxon may try to remove the stigma of the
spill from the ship by changing its name.
   ``Rechristening wouldn't be in order, but we are considering
whether we should start a new career for the vessel with a new
name,'' he said.
   The 987-foot tanker was allowed in as far as the pilot's buoy
outside the harbor at 11 p.m. Saturday. After inspection, the port
captain, Coast Guard Cmdr. Don Montoro, gave final clearance.
   The ship reached San Diego three weeks ago but was turned away
as a pollution risk and had to stay about 50 miles offshore while
Exxon negotiated with five state agencies for permission to enter
California waters.
   During that time, divers cut away dangling steel plates that
ripped from the ship's hull en route from Alaska. That was
necessary so the tanker could navigate shallow sections of the bay.
   Entering the harbor, the ship rode high with the top of the
rudder and propellers exposed.
   Coast Guard and Harbor Patrol boats guarded a security zone
around the tanker. Ships with pollution containment and salvage
equipment followed.
   Among dozens of surrounding pleasure boats were Greenpeace boats
with crews watching for signs of oil in the wake.
   ``Oil Spills Kill,'' said a banner with a skull and crossbones
on one boat. ``Change The Course, Steer Toward Sane Energy,'' said
another.
   Greenpeace activist Kelly Quirke said they were not protesting
the ship's arrival, but what it represents.
   ``It represents a fossil-fuel energy policy that is not only
destroying the ocean but the atmosphere,'' Quirke said.
   The repair job stirred excitement at the shipyard where the
tanker was built in 1986. Shipyard managers expect to add 300
people and boost the workforce to 3,000. Sixty laid-off workers
were to be recalled immediately, said Peter Zschiesche, a
representative of the machinists' union.
   ``They've been calling me every day wanting to know, `When is
the ship coming in? When can we go back to work?''' he said.
   Under Exxon's agreement with the state, the Valdez had to be
leak-free for the 24-hour period before entry and accompanied by a
pollution response vessel.
   Exxon put up $20 million in a bond and a trust account to insure
its performance and cover cleanup costs in the event of a spill in
local waters.

   Notices have been distributed to 900
employees at two Timken Co. steel plants advising them that they
face indefinite layoffs beginning Sept. 30.
   The notices came two weeks after the Canton-based steelmaker
confirmed that 200 layoffs were planned for late July and August.
   Company spokesman James Mulder said a ``softening demand for
steel'' was the reason for the layoffs at the two plants in this
northeastern Ohio city. Friday's notices comply with a federal law
requiring 60-day notifications of layoffs, he said.
   Jack Nichelson, president of the United Steelworkers of America
Local 1123, said he was surprised by the layoffs.
   ``Normally, the company lays people off because of lack of work.
But we have had no indication that there has been a drop in steel
orders,'' Nichelson said.
   Nichelson said the company's ball bearings operations had been
busier recently than its steel operation, with many bearing
employees working six days a week.

   TGI Friday's, a casual restaurant chain, will
become a private company in a merger with Carlson Hospitality Group
Inc. of Minnesota, the parent company of the Radisson hotel chain,
officials said.
   Since 1975, Carlson has been increasing its stake in
Dallas-based TGI Friday's and owned 80 percent of the restaurant
chain when the merger agreement was announced Friday. It will pay
about $52 million, or $14.87{ a share, for the remaining
outstanding shares.
   The deal must be approved by shareholders. It is supported by
TGI Friday's Chairman Curtis Carlson.
   In May, the company offered $14.50 a share, but several
shareholders filed lawsuits challenging the bid.
   TGI Friday's operates, franchises or licenses more than 150
Friday's and Dalts restaurants in the United States, Great Britain
and Mexico.
   No changes are planned in the colorful restaurants, many of
which are feature an early 20th century Americana motif. The
chain's headquarters will remain in Dallas, officials said.
   TGI Friday's went public in 1983, selling 25 percent of its
stock.
   Thomas Polski, a Carlson Hospitality Group spokesman, would not
discuss reasons for the buyout.
   Carlson Hospitality is the hotel and restaurant subsidiary of
Carlson Cos., a diversified travel industry corporation that is
privately held.

<HEAD>China to Increase Regulation of Import, Export Items</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign companies trying to sell such popular
products as cars, motorcycles, refrigerators and televisions to
China will have to obtain quality certificates, an official
newspaper reported Sunday.
   There have been complaints in China that foreign countries were
dumping low-quality goods here. The new measure also could be used
to slow the pace of such consumer imports. Imports exceeded exports
by $5.7 billion in the first half of this year, the State
Statistical Bureau reported.
   A new law on import and export commodity inspection, taking
effect Tuesday, also will require 481 Chinese products to undergo
inspection before they can be exported in a bid to improve quality
control, the China Daily reported.
   Zhu Zhenyuan, director general of the Inspection Administration,
said poor quality goods have hurt China's reputation in foreign
trade.
   For certain imports, the China Daily said, foreign sellers must
obtain quality certificates six months in advance to sell them in
China.
   Beginning next May 1, the English-language newspaper said, cars,
motorcycles, motorcycle engines, refrigerators, air conditioners,
compressors for freezers and air conditioners, televisions and
television tubes must be approved by China's State Administration
of Import and Export Commodity Inspection before Chinese firms can
import them.
   The new law will require that another 148 items undergo
inspection before they can be imported. The report did not list the
items.
   Zhu said the worst problems with exports occur with agricultural
products that are difficult to inspect. Some unscrupulous firms
steal shipments or substitute uninspected goods for good-quality
items after they have been inspected for export, he added.
   In one case, he said, such items as textbooks, cigarette boxes
and sliding weights were discovered inside a shipment of Chinese
sesame seeds to Cyprus.
   The China Daily said the inspection administration will begin
more thorough inspections of export items of dubious quality and
weigh shipments after rather than before they are loaded on ships.
   The new law also will stipulate fines for breaking the
inspection law and authorize other agencies to carry out
inspections that cannot be done by China's 10,000 trade inspectors,
it said.
   China will set up new inspection stations in the United States,
West Germany, Australia, Singapore, the Philippines and Bangladesh,
it said.
