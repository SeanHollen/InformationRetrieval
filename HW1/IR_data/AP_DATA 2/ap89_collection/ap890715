   The week in music here has been busy. The Mostly
Mozart Festival kicked off in Lincoln Center, to run until Aug. 26.
Willie Nelson inaugurated a large, new outdoor concert series on a
Hudson River pier.
   And among the top musical delights was Friday night's recreation
of a May 2, 1912, Clef Club Concert when James Reese Europe brought
125 black singers and instrumentalists to Carnegie Hall. They
performed music mostly by black composers, mostly high-quality,
high-spirited light classical, no spirituals. It was a first for an
American stage.
   High points of the evening included Jester Hairston, born in
1901, vigorously conducting ``Swing Along for Choir and Orchestra''
and ``Rain Song for Choir and Orchestra,'' both by Will Marion Cook.
``Swing Along'' got so much applause in 1912 it was performed again.
The same thing happened on Friday.
   Another high point was two numbers by the Versatile Entertainers
Quartet: piano, two banjos and snare drum. Conductor Maurice Peress,
who organized the program, couldn't find the quartet's music from
the 1912 concert. He knew they were post-ragtime and pre-jazz but
didn't know what they sounded like. But he turned up a 1916
recording and the quick-tempo ``Winter Nights'' and ``Down Home
Rag'' on it were recreated Friday, starting with a delightfully
trembling piano by Frank Owens.
   The Morgan State University Male Choir and Boys Choir of Harlem
sang Europe's ``Clef Club March,'' ``Benedictus from the Mass in G''
by Charles Bolin and S. Coleridge Taylor's ``By the Waters of
Babylon.''
   The diva engaged to sing ``Swanee River'' in 1912 substituted
``My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice'' from the opera ``Samson and
Delilah'' and Barbara Conrad did the same on Friday.
   William Warfield sang J. Rosamond Johnson's folk-sounding ``L'il
Gal'' and he and Miss Conrad had fun dueting ``Play that Barber Shop
Chord.'' Leon Bates played a piano solo with flourishes, ``Dance
Heroique.''
   At a pre-concert lecture, Dr. Reid Badger talked about Europe,
who formed the Clef Club as a booking agency for black musicians. He
maintained a Clef Club Orchestra, with mandolins and banjos instead
of second violins, for a strumming accompaniment, really the
beginning of orchestral jazz.
   Europe and his musicians often accompanied dancers Vernon and
Irene Castle. The last piece on the program was a waltz he composed
for them. Europe wrote for Broadway and in the Army in World War I,
he organized a brass band. He isn't better known, Badger said,
because he died at 38, stabbed by a deranged musician during a
concert in Boston.

<HEAD>Fish Escapes After Marathon Battle</HEAD>

   Bob Ploeger will have a well-documented
fish story to tell when he gets back home to Minnesota.
   As with most fish stories, it will be about the one that got away.
   But this one is on the record. Ploeger attracted the attention of
local news photographers and hundreds of onlookers as he battled a
king salmon for nearly a day and a half before losing the fish and
perhaps a world record.
   The length of the struggle coupled with the way the fish dragged
boats up, down and across the river prompted speculation that it
might have been the king of kings, the sport-caught salmon that
finally would top the 100-pound mark.
   Kings that big have been caught commercially in Cook Inlet near
the mouth of the Kenai, but the biggest ever taken on a rod and reel
was 97 pounds, 4 ounces.
   The struggle began just after noon Wednesday when the 63-year-old
Ploeger, a retired jailer from Sandstone, Minn., hooked the fish
about four miles upstream from the Soldotna Bridge in south-central
Alaska about 75 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   Ploeger was fishing from a drift boat with a rookie guide, Dan
Bishop.
   Ploeger and Bishop soon abandoned the drift boat, hopping aboard
a passing powerboat after Bishop was unable to maneuver adequately
through some boulder-studded rapids.
   He fought the fish that quickly was dubbed the ``Boss Hog''
through the night and all day Thursday.
   As word of the fish spread, the crowds grew. Local restaurants
and businesses offered food and drink to Ploeger and the people
helping him. Other guides shuttled fuel to the boat.
   Ploeger said there were hours of boredom punctuated by
heart-stopping runs when the fish decided to go somewhere else.
   At one point, they thought they had him.
   ``He started coming up,'' said Pat Cooper, another guide
recruited along the way. ``We thought he was worn out, but he must
have gotten scared by the net.''
   By Thursday evening, the shoreline was lined with people. Some
brought lawn chairs, others fished themselves. At 8:36 p.m. they
erupted in cheers when it seemed a world record had been set for the
longest battle with a sport fish.
   According to the Guiness Book of World Records, a fisherman took
32{ hours to land a 1,600-pound marlin in New Zealand. Ploeger had
that beat _ if he could land the fish.
   But about four hours later, in the murky twilight that passes for
night during Alaska summers, the fish escaped _ leaving Ploeger and
everyone else wondering how big it really was.

said.
   Mrs. Dukakis, whose sister, Janet Peters, was driving at the time

   The driver of the pickup truck, John M. Haddad, 22, was cited for
failing to use care in stopping, following too closely and failing
to have his vehicle inspected
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, completed a 30-day treatment for alcohol

   About 100 soldiers in National Guard units
from Kansas and Missouri were injured when a storm hit during war
games at the Pinon Canyon Maneuvers Site, officials said Friday.
   Sgt. Robert Aguilar of the Las Animas County sheriff's office
said the injuries ranged from scrapes, cuts and bruises to a few
broken bones and concussions. The most seriously injured were flown
to a hospital at nearby Fort Carson, he said.
   The soldiers were injured when winds, accompanied by rain and
small hail, flattened between 12 and 15 tents with troops inside, he
said. A half inch of rain and winds up to 50 and 60 mph were
reported, and there were unconfirmed reports of a tornado, Aguilar
said.
   Maj. Joy Moser, a public affairs officer for the 105th
Detachment, Kansas Army National Guard, said the storm hit about 3
p.m. and moved over the 562nd Support Group, U.S. Army Reserve Group
and the 82nd Field Hospital.
   He said the injured were evacuated because the field hospital
blew down.

   A top aide to former Housing Secretary Samuel
Pierce disputes Pierce's sworn claim that he had no direct role in
deciding what projects the scandal-scarred agency funded.
   Former HUD Assistant Secretary for Housing Shirley McVay Wiseman
also says Carla Hills, currently the U.S. trade representative,
lobbied Pierce to lift restrictions on a mortgage lender now under
federal criminal investigation.
   Hills is scheduled to testify before the committee on Monday.
   Wiseman said in sworn testimony Friday that Pierce personally
called her and instructed her to approve more than $15 million in
funding for a Durham, N.C., project sought by a former Pierce law
partner.
   Pierce said: ``I want the project funded,'' Wiseman told the
House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing,
one of three congressional panels investigating mismanagement and
fraud at the housing agency.
   The HUD approval brought more than $11.3 million in rent
subsidies, a $2.3 million grant and more than $3 million in tax
credits to developers who were seeking to turn a hosiery mill into
an apartment complex, said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of
the subcommittee.
   Pierce has testified he set up a three-person panel to make
funding decisions for the moderate rehabilitation program, but said
he maintained ``final authority'' over the decisions.
   ``I did not plan, however, to get into the decision-making
process of the panel when there was no complaint to justify my doing
so,'' he told the subcommittee in May.
   Efforts by The Associated Press to reach Pierce for comment were
unsuccessful. Lantos said he would seek to recall Pierce to the
subcommittee before the congressional recess Aug. 4.
   Wiseman said she told Pierce she could not fund the project over
the objections of career HUD employees who had been ``violently
opposed'' to the project.
   The project was eventually approved by Wiseman's successor, Janet
Hale, who said she believed she was ``acting on the approval of my
boss.''
   Wiseman also testified that DRG Funding Corp., a private lender
that was suspended from participating in a $5 billion program in
which HUD insured large portions of mortgages, was allowed to get
back into the program after lobbying from Hills, a former HUD
Secretary.
   DRG is now under FBI criminal investigation.
   Wiseman said DRG's ability to underwrite mortgages had been
placed on hold during the Reagan administration because of
infractions of department rules. The suspension remained despite a
meeting with Hills in late 1984 or early 1985 to get the
restrictions lifted.
   ``It was not a convincing argument,'' Wiseman said.
   But DRG's probation was lifted despite the concerns of staff
members, she said. ``It was later brought to my attention that Hills
had ... taken the case to Secretary Pierce. I was informed by staff
that there was a meeting,'' she said.
   Lawmakers expressed concern about the conflicting testimony
regarding Pierce.
   ``The factual noose seems to be tightening around Samuel Pierce's
neck,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   ``We were very careful about asking him if he had ever tried to
influence any project and we have two people making it very clear
that he wanted a particular project funded,'' said Rep. Christopher
Shays, R-Conn.
   Meanwhile, HUD filed suit in Forth Worth, Texas, on Friday
seeking to recover more than $2.5 million a Texas woman is accused
of bilking from the agency and spending on real estate, cars and
guns. The woman is one of 10 closing agents nationwide the agency
believes defrauded HUD of about $10 million.

   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who knows how to
keep people guessing about his possible presidential ambitions,
continues to talk about his lack of interest in discussing the
subject.
   As usual, he refused even to hint at a yes or no.
   ``I want to talk about it because I want to dispose of it,''
Cuomo was quoted as saying in Friday's edition of the Times Union.
   ``If I speak on the subject at all, it becomes an occasion for
speculation,'' Cuomo said. ``And so, for the time being, if anyone
does ask me about it, I'm simply not going to discuss it.''
   Cuomo then went on to talk about ``a thousand letters'' he's
received from people urging him to run for president _ ``letters
from some names that would shock you ... Republicans, people of
great stature in this country.''
   On Monday, Cuomo set off the latest round of speculation about
him and the presidency when he told a meeting of the New York State
Broadcasters Association that as a public servant he was
``obligated'' to think about running for president.

   Grandma Moses, in the guise of actress
Cloris Leachman, has come home to the valley that inspired her
artist's eye.
   The town about 45 miles northeast of Albany gave a warm welcome
Friday to the actress who portrays Moses in the stage show ``Grandma
Moses _ An American Primitive.''
   ``I really believe we've found the heart and soul of what we're
trying to do here,'' Leachman, 63, told an audience of about 150
people, including about 15 descendants of Moses.
   Leachman sat with Dorothy Moses, 90, widow of Grandma Moses'
youngest son, Hugh; Jean Moses Harrington, 65; and Margery Moses
Fitzgerald, 60, both granddaughters of the painter.
   Anna Mary Robertson Moses was born in Eagle Bridge, just a few
miles from Hoosick Falls, moved to Virginia's Shenandoah Valley with
her husband, and returned at the age of 45.
   Moses began painting in her 70s, after her hands had grown too
weak for other tasks. She painted for three decades, illustrating
Clement Moore's ``'Twas the Night Before Christmas'' at the age of
100.
   Grandma Moses was 101 when she died in December 1961.

   Eastside High School will be leaning on
someone new come September, following the city Board of Education's
replacement of disciplinarian Joe Clark as school principal.
   The school board Thursday unanimously approved Charles Lighty for
the high-profile job. In chosing Lighty, an elementary school
principal, board members said it was time to emphasize academics at
a school that became famous for Clark's barking, authoritarian style.
   Clark, 52, who is on a leave of absence at his South Orange home
recuperating from open heart surgery, already had announced his
intention not to return to Eastside in September.
   His no-nonsense approach to education was symbolized by a
baseball bat and bullhorn he wielded during patrols of the halls at
Eastside. His efforts were depicted in the movie ``Lean on Me.''
   Telephone calls to Lighty's home were not answered Friday.

   A New York executive accused of pumping money
into the campaign of a former governor of Guam in exchange for a
political favor pleaded guilty Friday to three counts of mail fraud.
   Arthur Abba Goldberg entered the plea before U.S. District Judge
Jesse Curtis, said Guam's U.S. Attorney, Bill O'Connor. In exchange
for his guilty plea, 46 counts alleging bribery, conspiracy, wire
and mail fraud, and violation of interstate racketeering statutes
were dismissed.
   ``In dismissing the counts, the Guam issues were dissolved,''
O'Connor said. ``Other issues are on the table if another
jurisdiction sees fit to follow through.''
   Twelve of the counts were related directly to Guam, a U.S.
territory since August, 1950, said O'Connor. The balance of the
counts related to fraud involving use of the Commercial Bank of
Americas in transactions that did not involve Guam, O'Connor said.
   Although Goldberg, executive vice president of the New York bond
underwriting firm of Matthews &amp; Wright, only pleaded to three of the
dozen counts, O'Connor was satisfied with the outcome.
   ``Mr. Goldberg's plea gave the same latitude of sentencing than
if he went to trial,'' O'Connor said. ``We, of course, will
recommend jail time and a heavy fine.''
   Goldberg faces a possible 15 years imprisonment, a $750,000 fine
and restitution payments, O'Connor said in a telephone interview
from his Santa Ana office. Sentencing was scheduled in Curtis' court
Sept. 11.
   One of Goldberg's attorneys, Howard L. Weitzman, said he had no
immediate comment. A receptionist who answered a call made after
business hours to another defense attorney, Bruce Hochman, said
Hochman had gone for the day.
   The three mail fraud counts concerned $57,500 bilked from the
Guam Program Development Fund and a letter assuring fund authorities
that transactions were above board, while fraud was taking place.
   Goldberg prepared phony invoices that were sent to the bank
entrusted with fund money. ``The bank paid the money Goldberg
exerted for his purposes and ... he attempted to cover up later with
false papers in the files,'' O'Connor said.
   O'Connor said $25,000 was ``used to buy campaign paraphernalia _
parasols, hats, shirts, junk like that'' for Guam Gov. Ricardo J.
Bordallo's unsuccessful 1986 re-election bid.
   The funds were funneled to Bordallo after he was promised the
money in exchange for his support on a bond issue, $300 million of
which was sold by Matthews &amp; Wright.
   The bond was approved by the Guam Legislature in 1985. Matthews &amp;
Wright deny any wrongdoing.
   Bordallo was acquitted in February, 1986, of accepting bribes
from Goldberg but convicted on 10 counts of government corruption.
   The case is among about 25 municipal bond deals nationwide
involving Matthews &amp; Wright under investigation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

<HEAD>Archbishop Calls for Blacks to Lead Church ``From Within''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leader of the nation's 300 Roman Catholic
bishops admits there are persistent ``elements of racism'' in the
church, but is calling for a black priest's breakaway congregation
to return for the sake of unity.
   Archbishop John May of St. Louis, president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, promised the Rev. George A.
Stallings Jr. the nation's two million black Catholics would be
given ``full voice'' in the church.
   ``It is possible to ... be a voice of conscience for the family
and lead that family from within,'' May said in a statement Friday.
   Stallings, 41, has been suspended for holding services the past
two weeks at his Imani Temple in defiance of Washington Cardinal
James Hickey.
   A spokesman for Stallings said he would have no comment on May's
statement or another call for unity from the nation's 13 black
bishops earlier this week.
   Stallings has said he formed the new congregation because the
Catholic Church has not addressed black concerns and he has charged
the church with racism.
   May's statement conceded, ``Surely, as all the bishops in this
country have acknowledged in the past, there have been elements of
racism in the church and there continue to be.
   ``We need to recognize more black leadership; our liturgies need
more of the vibrancy, and our policies more of the insight, of
African Americans,'' May said.
   He said the nation's 52 million Roman Catholics ``share the
sadness'' reflected in the black bishops' call Wednesday for
reconciliation.
   The black bishops' statement said in part, ``We sincerely hope
(Stallings' followers) are not commingling personal disappointment,
individually felt frustrations, and personal anger under the banner
of racism. Racism is a sin which the church must address. It is too
serious an issue to be used as a cover for selfish concerns.''
   Several priests have supported Stallings, however, including 15
who met with him in Chicago Thursday. They called for Hickey to lift
Stallings' suspension, imposed after the first service of the
renegade church at Howard University on July 2.
   Appearing Friday on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Stallings denied he
is forming the church for personal gain. ``I know exactly the
picture they're trying to paint ... but Martin Luther King Jr.,
Malcolm X, Jesse Jackson, people say they all have inflated egos,''
Stallings said on the national television program.
   He affirmed his plans to continue services despite the
suspension, and said he ``cannot be excommunicated from Jesus
Christ.''
   Stallings said Hickey should ``eat crow,'' and ``admit he's
wrong.''
   ``Since the Roman Catholic Church cannot make inroads into the
black community, all we are saying is, let us show you how. What's
wrong with that?'' he asked.
   Suspension means Stallings is not sanctioned to say Mass or
perform other sacraments. It is the strongest step Hickey can take
without moving to excommunicate Stallings.

   Officials are investigating the pilot who
survived an 800-mile flight, bullet wound and crash-landing in the
ocean, expanding probes that began when three dozen guns and a can
of ether were found in Thomas Root's private plane.
   The reports that the Washington communications lawyer is under
investigation by several agencies added a peculiar twist to the tale
of Root's rescue from the Atlantic Ocean after apparently crashing
unconscious into the water.
   Officials at agencies said Root is being investigated by the U.S.
Customs Service over the weapons and ether, the North Carolina
Secretary of State's Office concerning possible securities
violations, the National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI,
which investigates crimes aboard aircraft.
   Widespread publicity over Root's unlikely survival prompted
Customs to expand its investigation Friday into Miami and North
Carolina.
   ``This is weird to say the least,'' said a Customs official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In addition, a review of documents at the Federal Communications
Commission showed Root repeatedly failed to comply with deadlines
and other requirements in cases before the commission.
   Root also represented numerous clients of a Georgia-based company
that another broadcast firm labeled a ``notorious application mill''
for FM broadcast licenses that allegedly has bilked hundreds of
individuals of their investments.
   The 35 guns, many loaded, were found during a search April 24 by
federal and local officials of Root's Cessna 210 at the Manassas,
Va., airport, said the Customs official.
   All the guns were legal under federal law, and all but one _ a
machine gun Root had registered with the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms but not with Virginia authorities _ were legal
under state law. The state has filed a misdemeanor charge against
him over the machine gun, the official said.
   Among the guns, including assault-style weapons and three
.357-caliber Magnums, the officials found silencers, ammunition
clips, handcuffs, an electrical stun gun and a five-gallon can of
ether _ which is used in cocaine production _ in the plane, the
Customs official said.
   During a May 31 interview with Root by Prince William County
Polie and a Customs agent, ``by and large he was able to account for
legal possession of those weapons.''
   ``Basically, he indicated that he was a gun collector,'' the
official said. But Root did not explain why he kept the weapons on
his plane _ registered to a Washington-based company he owns _ nor
why they were loaded.
   Root told officials the ether ``was used to clean his aircraft.
But of course that's not what you use to clean an aircraft with
unless you're going to blow it up,'' the official said.
   Customs kept the case open ``because when you come across this
many weapons ... we always continue to take a look to make sure no
Customs laws have been violated,'' he said.
   The search had been prompted by an unidentified source who said
``there was a suspicious aircraft at Manassas Airfield,'' the
Customs official said.
   Hollywood, Fla., Police Chief Richard Witt revealed Friday that
Root had been shot. The bullet traveled through his left rib cage
and his colon, left his body, and then pierced his arm. A powder
burn indicated Root was shot at close range, the chief said.
   In North Carolina, Secretary of State Rufus Edmisten said his
office had spoken with Root about a securities investigation
involving Georgia-based Sonrise Management Services and that the
lawyer ``knew he was under investigation.''
   Sonrise said in a statement that the only connection between the
company and Root ``is that he represents certain entities which also
number among our clientele.''
   Edmisten said Root was the attorney for investment partnerships
formed by Sonrise to obtain FCC licenses.
   Meanwhile, National Transportation Safety Board spokeswoman
Rachel Halterman said investigators ``have not come to any
conclusions and have not ruled out anything at all'' about what
caused the events on the plane Thursday.

<HEAD>Protest Group Says Report Criticizing FBI Should Go Farther</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   An organization investigated by the FBI during
its protests of U.S. policies in Central America says a Senate
Intelligence Committee report criticizing the FBI probe didn't go
far enough.
   Hugh Byrne, political director of the Committee in Solidarity
with the People of El Salvador, praised the Senate for calling the
FBI surveillance of his organization unjustified and telling the
agency to purge its files of the case.
   But ``we take strong issue with its conclusion that the FBI
investigation was an aberration and that it wasn't politically
motivated,'' Byrne said Friday after the Intelligence Committee
issued a report criticizing the FBI's investigation of CISPES
between 1983 and 1985.
   The report sharply criticized FBI management for letting the
investigation continue and said the probe was based on ``allegations
that should not have been considered credible.''
   ``The CISPES files contain information about domestic political
activities that the FBI should never have gathered,'' said Sen.
David Boren, D-Okla., Intelligence Committee chairman, and Sen.
William Cohen, R-Maine, vice chairman.
   ``That information must be removed from FBI records so it cannot
be used to damage the reputation of innocent persons,'' they said.
   But the report called the investigation an ``aberration'' and
said it did not reflect ``significant FBI political or ideological
bias,'' a point noted by both CISPES and the FBI.
   ``We don't believe that an investigation that involved 59 field
officers and 178 spinoff investigations that resulted in retrievable
information being held in FBI files about approximately 2,375
individuals and 1,330 groups can be called an aberration,'' said
Byrne.
   ``We believe the investigation was politically motivated from the
start,'' said Byrne.
   The FBI said Director William Sessions is still reviewing the
report but issued a statement saying it was ``significant'' that the
report found ``the CISPES investigation was not politically
motivated to harass or influence legitimate First Amendment
activities.''
   An FBI spokesman said the files would not be immediately purged
because there is continuing litigation over the investigation.
   The Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador was
formed in 1980 because of Reagan administration aid to El Salvador,
which has totaled $3 billion since 1981.
   A 1983 FBI memorandum is quoted in the report as attacking CISPES
for its protests and its practice of hosting Salvadoran refugees who
said their lives had been threatened by death squads in their
homelands.
   ``It is imperative at this time to formulate some plan of attack
against CISPES and specifically against individuals ... who
defiantly display their contempt for the U.S. government by making
speeches and propagandizing their cause while asking for political
asylum,'' the memo said.
   The report said, ``There may not have been tangible harm intended
or done to any groups or individuals involved in constitutionally
protected activity, but unjustified investigations of political
expression and dissent can have a debilitating effect upon our
political system.''
   Despite such comments, the Center for Constitutional Rights,
which filed a lawsuit on behalf of CISPES, said ``critical and
unresolved issues relating to the monitoring of First
Amendment-protected activities of domestic groups that oppose U.S.
policy'' remain.
   The probe was done while William Webster, now director of the
CIA, was head of the FBI.
   Sessions has taken several internal measures over the probe,
including disciplining six employees at the supervisor, unit chief
and section chief levels.

<HEAD>New Oil Spill Rules Could Mean Exxon Pays More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court ruling could make oil companies
pay more to clean up oil spills, including the massive spill from an
Exxon tanker that polluted the coastline of Alaska, says a
congressman involved in the fight over liability for environmental
accidents.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia unanimously ruled Friday the Interior Department should
rewrite its rules on paying for oil spills to include the costs of
more than just the monetary value of animals killed.
   The decision raises chances ``that companies will have to pay the
whole cost of restoring an environment,'' said Rep. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J.
   Torricelli said the case could have a major impact on damage
payments by oil companies involved in spills, such as the March 24
accident that occurred when the tanker Exxon Valdez dumped 11
million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's pristine Prince William
Sound.
   ``This will make Exxon's exposure much greater,'' said Torricelli.
   Interior Department spokesman Al Levitt said the agency hadn't
studied the ruling and wouldn't have any comment. He said no
decision had been made on whether to appeal the case.
   The regulations were issued three years ago to implement the 1977
Clean Water Act and the 1980 Superfund law, which required the
government to write regulations determining the monetary costs of
oil spills.
   Several environmental groups and states sued over the regulations.
   Under the 1986 regulations, the Interior Department created a
computer model putting a dollar value for ``lost use'' of various
types of wildlife.
   For example, the cost of a fur seal was set at $15, based on the
expected value of a seal pelt. The cost of geese ranged up to $35,
based on their popularity among hunters.
   But the appeals court said Congress, in writing the laws, had
intended that repayment should be more broadly drawn to consider not
simply the value of lost wildlife, but the larger cost of restoring
the damaged environment.
   ``Because in some _ probably a majority _ of cases, lost-use
value will be lower than the cost of restoration, Interior's rule
will result in damages awards too small to pay for the costs or
restoration,'' the ruling said.
   The Interior Department has not yet decided on a damage
assessment for either the Alaskan spill or three smaller spills
which occurred last month off the coasts of Rhode Island, Delaware
and Texas.

   Stanley Steamers chugged and puffed from
lobster bakes to parades and museums as owners from all over the
continent headed Down East to pay tribute to the Maine twins who
invented the automobiles.
   The gathering was to wind up Friday evening with a Blow-Down
Banquet following a showing at a coastal transportation museum.
After operating their cars, drivers ``blow down'' the boilers,
venting steam.
   A day earlier, more than 30 drivers made the trip to Squirrel
Island, where F.E. and F.O. Stanley, inventors of the celebrated
steam-powered cars, used to spend summers.
   In their first Maine ``hub tour,'' owners of Stanley Steamers and
the less-common White steamers came from all over the continent.
Three vehicles made it on their own steam, while others made most of
the trip on trailer beds.
   ``A lot of these people came 700 or 800 miles,'' said Don Bourdon
of Woodstock, Vt., who made the 250-mile trip in his 1913 Stanley
Mountain Wagon.
   ``I would say this is the largest number of Stanleys that have
been running (together)'' said Gordon Smith of Orillia, Ontario.
   Drivers must adjust valves to control water, fuel, throttle and
steam pressure. For the car to be ready to go, a pilot light must be
lit. It takes about 20 minutes before a cold steamer will move.
   Of the roughly 400 Stanley Steamers nationwide, about 150 are
still roadworthy, said Bourdon.
   Stanley Steamers were built between 1899 and 1924 in
Massachusetts. It was a family-owned business until 1917, when F.E.
Stanley was killed in one of the steamers and the business was sold.

   Some people will go a long way to
defend their hometowns.
   Richard Friese, a soldier stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul,
South Korea, didn't try to dodge his civic duty when he was summoned
for jury duty. Instead he took some vacation, hopped a plane and
traveled 6,000 miles to meet the obligation.
   ``We get Johnny Carson in Korea. He is continually cutting down
this town. I felt it was my duty to come back and do this and maybe
show the people that someone (living) out of Bakersfield does care
for this place,'' Friese said.
   He reported to Kern County Superior Court on Monday and still
hadn't been seated on a jury Friday.
   It may have been well worth the trip, had Friese been paid the
usual 15 cents for every mile traveled from home to the court.
   But he was only paid mileage for the distance traveled to court
from his address in this city 100 miles north of Los Angeles, plus
$5 for every day he reported.

<TEXT>
   Coal miners in at least three states agreed
to return to work this weekend, complying with the United Mine
Workers union in its bid to end a monthlong wildcat strike.
   About 15,250 miners in Indiana, Alabama and Illinois decided to
return to work beginning with shifts at midnight Friday and
continuing through the weekend, UMW officials said.
   ``There may be a light at the end of the tunnel,'' said UMW
District 11 international executive board member Roger Myers in
Indiana.
   ``We're just pleased that the miners have chosen to return to
their jobs,'' said Kevin Feeney, a spokesman for AMAX Coal
Industries Inc.
   But miners in Kentucky said Friday they would stay off their
jobs. The situation of miners in West Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee and
Pennsylvania was unclear. Wildcat strikes in Virginia and Missouri
ended last month.
   UMW President Richard Trumka on Friday ended a five-day
``memorial period,'' a contract-sanctioned work stoppage that had
affected 60,000 union miners east of the Mississippi River.
   He also asked 37,000 wildcat strikers _ included among those
participating in the memorial period _ to go back to work on their
next scheduled shifts.
   The UMW international executive board meets July 26, and Trumka
asked the miners involved in the wildcat strikes to return to work
at least until then.
   The wildcat walkouts began June 12 in support of the UMW's strike
against Pittston Coal Group Inc.
   That strike, idling 1,900 UMW members in Virginia, West Virginia
and Kentucky, began April 5 and showed no signs of ending.
   Also Friday, a federal judge in Virginia said he wanted to talk
with Trumka and Paul Douglas, head of The Pittston Co., parent
company of Pittston Coal. Trumka accepted; Douglas gave no word.
   Only a small group of miners were scheduled to work today, and
under the union's contract, no work is permitted at underground
mines on Sundays.
   ``I anticipate a major return starting Sunday night and Monday,''
said UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran.
   Trumka called the memorial period last week in an attempt to calm
the coal fields, where non-union coal shipments have been met by
shootings, rocks and ``jack rocks,'' nails specially welded to
flatten tires.
   As Trumka called on the strikers to return to work, violence
erupted again in the coal fields. Two company guards were shot and
wounded at Hampden Coal Co. near Gilbert, and a bomb damaged a
replacement miner's car at Pittston Coal's headquarters in Lebanon,
Va.
   Coal company officials this week blasted West Virginia Gov.
Gaston Caperton and state police for letting the strikers get out of
hand. Caperton and state police have defended their actions, saying
the coal fields are under control.
   However, no arrests had been made in any of the incidents of
violence that have marked the wildcat strikes, and the U.S.
attorney's office in Charleston said Friday it will begin
investigating such incidents.
   Tension was evident after the Hampden shootings.
   Hampden Coal President Sid Young III _ speaking with two handguns
strapped to his body, and flanked by two men toting semi-automatic
weapons _ decried the violence. But he said his employees will not
be intimidated by the 150 miners camped out in front of his mine
beside U.S. 52.
   ``I'd hate to be in the first 50 guys who try to stop'' shipments
out of the mine, he said.
   On the Hampden picket line, most union members refused to talk to
reporters. An Associated Press reporter was escorted from the site
by a miner who held an ax handle pressed against the reporter's head.
   ``If ya'll know what's good for you, you'll stay away,'' the
miner said.

<TEXT>
   Jack Kent Cooke, the owner of the Washington
Redskins, sold his cable television systems to six companies for
about $1.6 billion, according to a report published today.
   The business deal, believed to involve one of the three largest
purchase prices in cable history, is expected to net Cooke more than
$500 million in profit in two years, The Washington Post reported.
   The properties have 675,000 subscribers in 17 states and will be
sold to a consortium of companies that includes Tele-Communications
Inc., the Denver-based operator of the nation's largest group of
cable-television systems, and Inter-media Partners, a privately held
San Francisco company partly owned by Tele-Communications, said the
Post.
   Cooke paid a total of $1.05 billion for the systems in two deals
in 1987, investing about $200 million of his own money and borrowing
the rest, according to the newspaper.
   Other buyers include TCA Cable TV Inc. of Tyler, Texas; Chambers
Communications Corp. of Eugene, Ore., Falcon Cable TV of Los
Angeles; and a group including members of the John J. Rigas family,
which controls Adelphia Communications of Pennsylvania.

<HEAD>`Star Wars' Particle Beam Fired Into Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is studying results of a ``Star
Wars'' test that is considered a key step in U.S. research to deploy
futuristic weapons that could shoot powerful beams at enemy missiles.
   Defense Department officials on Friday confirmed completion of
the test, which involved firing a beam of electrically neutral
atomic particles into space for the first time.
   The BEAR test _ which stands for the Beam Experiment Aboard
Rocket _ is designed to test how an accelerator of neutral particles
would work in space.
   The experiment, which has been planned for more than a year, was
completed early Thursday morning at the White Sands Missile Range in
New Mexico, said Army Maj. William O'Connell, a spokesman for the
Strategic Defense Initiative Organization.
   Program scientists need to test whether neutral particle beams _
in this case, hydrogen atoms _ can be used to discriminate between
real and mock Soviet warheads.
   The spokesman said it was ``presumptive'' to announce whether the
test had been a success, since officials and scientists still need
to study the results of the experiment over the weekend before
releasing more information Monday.
   The experiment involved lifting into space _ just for a few
minutes _ a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small Aires
rocket. Before the rocket returned to earth, the accelerator was to
be turned on for collection of data on how it worked and how the
beam moved.
   In June, a similar test was aborted when the rocket failed to
ignite on command.
   The Star Wars program is a research effort aimed at developing
lasers, beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons that could be
used to automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the
United States or its allies. The Pentagon and Energy Department are
spending $4 billion on such research this year.

<TEXT>
   A senior Agriculture Department scientist says
the possibility that the so-called ``greenhouse effect'' will cause
global warming ``is too much of a risk to ignore.''
   Assistant Secretary Charles E. Hess, who oversees science and
education programs, said Friday he has named Gary R. Evans as his
special assistant for global change issues.
   ``There are climate experts who claim the 1988 drought was
evidence that global warming has already begun,'' Hess said. ``A
conclusive link has not been proven, but the threat of global
warming from heat trapped by so-called greenhouse gases is too much
of a risk to ignore.''
   Those gases include carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane,
nitrogen oxides and halons, Hess said in a statement. Some of the
gases also seem to be causing a thinning of the high-level ozone
layer, which filters out a large part of the ultraviolet rays which
can limite the growth of sensitive crops.
   Evans, who has been deputy administrator of the department's
Agricultural Research Service, will coordinate activities among
seven USDA agencies and the land-grant universities as part of the
department's efforts to protect crops and forests, Hess said.

<NOTE>FBI Examines Contract Allegations At Fernald</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI is investigating allegations of
contract fraud at an Ohio plant that makes material for nuclear
weapons, says a top Energy Department official.
   The Fernald plant, where production was suspended earlier this
week, also is the target of a special investigation by a DOE team
assessing health and safety measures and other aspects of the
plant's operation.
   ``Fernald's been at the top of our list for some time,'' said
Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore on Friday. ``We're going in
there to see what's wrong and what might need to be done to get into
compliance.''
   FBI spokesman Edwin Boldt said from Cincinnati that the
investigation was triggered by an allegation of criminal wrongdoing
in contracting. He provided
   no details.
   The Fernald complex, located about 18 miles northwest of
Cincinnati, is a key contributor to U.S. nuclear weapons production.
It processes uranium compounds, produces uranium billets for nuclear
weapons production and makes uranium target elements for defense
nuclear reactors.
   It's also one of the government's most seriously contaminated
facilities.
   The Environmental Protection Agency this week proposed adding
Fernald to the Superfund list of high-priority cleanup sites.

<NOTE>Rules Proposed for Security Ban on Foreign Takeovers</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department has published for
public comment proposed rules that would allow President Bush to
plead national security and block takeover of a U.S. firm by
foreigners.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., and Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., who
were responsible for parts of the law, praised the proposed
regulations published Friday in the Federal Register. The comment
period runs through Sept. 12, although the Treasury Department said
later comments will be considered if possible.
   The Trade Act, signed by former President Ronald Reagan last
August, provides authority for the rules that would allow the
president to block a merger if he has credible evidence that the
foreign interest taking control might act to hurt U.S. security. If
a president decides on an investigation, he gets 30 days to begin
it, 45 days to complete it and another 15 days to announce it.
   Florio said the Treasury has interpreted the law broadly to make
sure that it covers a variety of ways that a foreign firm could take
over an American one.

<NOTE>US Making Progress on Compensation Concerning Iran Air Crash</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will announce a
compensation offer early next week for families of the non-Iranian
victims on the Iran Air flight shot down by a U.S. warship a year
ago, officials say.
   All but 40 of the 290 people who died were Iranian. The United
States has said it would pay compensation to all families, but the
Iranian government has refused to provide details about its citizens
who died.
   The 40 non-Iranians were Indians, Pakistanis, Koreans, Japanese
and citizens of several Arab countries.
   The U.S. government has said it will not pay the Iranian
government directly, and Iran has called that position ``not
acceptable.''
   In civil lawsuits arising from crash deaths in the United States,
courts generally award compensation based on the lost earnings of a
family member. Thus families of people who die early in lucrative
careers usually win larger awards than families of retired people.
It is not known whether such an approach would be followed in the
government's compensation offer.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, on Friday were
unable to provide figures on the compensation package they expect
but said a formal announcement was expected early next week.

   A gunshot wound suffered by Thomas Root is
only one of the mysteries surrounding the attorney after he flew
apparently unconscious 800 miles down the East Coast.
   Officials from Washington to Florida hope to interview Root today
about the flight and crash landing in Bahamian waters. But they also
are curious about two probes involving his gun collection and
conduct as an attorney.
   Root was in stable condition today at Memorial Hospital in
Hollywood, north of Miami. He was under heavy sedation Friday.
   ``It's an odd story all right,'' said Root's brother-in-law,
Brett Geer, after visiting Root at the hospital. ``With this wound
and him not being able to recollect how he got it, I'm sure there is
reason for an investigation.''
   Root had a .32-caliber handgun with him in the cockpit, Geer said.
   Investigators from the FBI and National Transportation Safety
Board need permission from Root's physicians to conduct the
interview.
   ``There are many questions I'll be asking,'' said NTSB
investigator Andrew Alston.
   Developments Friday included:
   _In Washington, a U.S. Customs official said authorities found 35
guns, many of them loaded, and a can of ether in a search of Root's
plane last April at the Manassas Airport in Virginia.
   All of the guns were legal under federal law, and all but one
under state law, which led to a state misdemeanor charge. The
arsenal included assault-style rifles and three .357-caliber Magnum
pistols. Root had told Customs officials that the ether, which can
be used in cocaine production, was used to clean his aircraft.
   _In North Carolina, Secretary of State Rufus Edmisten said his
office has been investigating security fraud allegations against a
company with which Root acted as an attorney. Edmisten said there
are allegations that the company, Sonrise Management Services, was
set up in a way that allowed it to avoid securities laws. Edmisten
said the lawyer knew he was under investigation.
   Root, 36, apparently became unconscious in his cockpit Friday
with his plane on autopilot and military pilots shadowing his
aircraft for nearly four hours.
   His plane ran out of gas and crashed in mile-deep waters 14 miles
west of the Bahamian island of Eleuthera. Root swam to a raft, where
rescuers pulled him to safety.
   Geer said Root told him the bullet wound was not self-inflicted
and could have occurred when the impact of the crash triggered a
.32-caliber pistol carried on board the single-engine Cessna.
   Hollywood Police Chief Richard Witt noted that a powder burn on
Root's skin indicated the shot was fired at close range.
Investigators said there was no evidence that anybody else was in
the plane.
   Witt said surgeons had found a wound to Root's abdomen, and
determined that a bullet passed through his colon, exited, struck
him in the left arm and exited again.
   Authorities have received ``multiple phone calls'' from people in
several states making ``various allegations that have not been
confirmed,'' said Alston.
   He declined to give details, but said they came from private
citizens and government agencies on topics that included Root's
finances and his piloting ability.
   Root's wife, Kathy, 35, was in Florida but has refused to comment
on the episode. Alston said he hoped to interview Root's relatives.
   Authorities earlier had speculated that the Alexandria, Va.,
communications lawyer may have had a heart attack or inhaled carbon
monoxide, causing him to black out about two hours after leaving
Washington National Airport.
   Alston said Root reported in radio transmissions that he was
having difficulty breathing, and then radio contact ceased.
   Capt. James Rahman, the Coast Guard surgeon who first treated
Root in Nassau, Bahamas, said he was shocked to learn a gunshot
wound had been discovered by doctors at Memorial Hospital.
   Rahman said Root hestitated when asked to explain why he passed
out.
   ``Looking back, now I see that he answered everything else
promptly. I had to ask that question twice and he paused before
answering, but I didn't think about it at the time,'' the doctor
said.

   Behind the cement walls, barbed-wire fences and
guard towers of Jneid prison, 850 tough Palestinian prisoners are
running their own state.
   The prison, built on the barren hills near the West Bank town of
Nablus, is the largest for ``serious'' Palestinian guerrillas, those
serving 20 years or more for attacks on Israeli targets.
   Among the inmates, dozens are serving life sentences, Israel
Television said.
   The report Friday by the state television, the first time TV had
been allowed to film inside the prison walls, showed something that
looked more like a miniature state than a jail.
   The 850 inmates are kept in small, often crowded cells, each
occupied by an average of 14 people. Jneid prison costs Israel more
than $7.5 million a year.
   Unlike other prisons, there are reportedly no sexual assaults and
no drugs in this one, practically run by a committee of six elected
leaders.
   ``We have a committee of six prisoners who belong to different
PLO factions. Each group has its own internal laws of selecting its
representatives,'' said the prisoners' spokesman, Abdel Khader Fares.
   The committee was shown discussing prisoners' demands with warden
Muffid Abbas, a Druse officer, and writing down a protocol of the
talks.
   ``The prisoners are trying to expand all the time what they see
as mini-autonomy. They demand improvements in all the fields: new
teeth, union rights ... free passage from one prison section to
another and a private doctor,'' the television said.
   Abbas said he usually responds positively to prisoners requests
``if it does not harm the security of the prison and if it is a
human matter the prisoners need. They know it and they appreciate
it.''
   But Fares, serving a 15-year sentence for planting a bomb and a
firearm attack on an Israeli bus, had a different opinion.
   He said inmates can pressure the authorities because of their
influence on the Palestinian revolt that has raged for 19 months
outside Jneid walls.
   ``They feel we are a honorable part of the Palestinian people in
the (occupied) territories and we can influence the situation,'' he
said.
   The prisoners refuse to work for the benefit of their Israeli
enemies. But the discipline imposed by their leadership is tight and
they clean their rooms, run the kitchen and have a tailor and a
barber.
   The prison library has 4,000 books and the prisoners use it to
conduct lessons in Hebrew, English, French, philosophy and Marxism,
the television said.
   The prisoners also are allowed to spend 2{ hours in the prison
courtyards. During one such break, prisoners were shown purposefully
playing table tennis, basketball and chess or jogging around the
courtyard.
   ``The terrorists view the prison as an academy for revolutionary
education and for the creation of commanders,'' the television said.
``Every minute is reserved for useful conversations, studies, for
strengthening the body and the spirit.''
   Simon Shoshan, an officer of the prison administration, said the
prisoners ``have their own doctrine. They have a specific way of
life: sport activities, reading, education. They want to leave the
prison more educated.''
   Fares said the prisoners view their miniature Jneid state as a
step bringing the Palestinians closer to their goal of independence.
   ``We are inside prisons, but everybody knows we are part of the
Palestinian people, part of the Palestine Liberation Organization,''
he said.
   During family visits, held in a large hall separated by wire
mesh, the prisoners' conversations are not monitored and it showed
the inmates passing written notes described as ``instructions and
reports,'' the television said.
   ``This is the heart of the prison, a link to the territories,''
the television said. ``And if you ask the prisoners, the uprising
started here, in security prisons.''

<HEAD>Romania Bars U.N. Human Rights Investigator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N.-appointed special investigator on
human rights in Romania said that Bucharest has refused his request
for an entry visa.
   Joseph Voyame, a Swiss jurist named investigator for Romania last
March by the U.N. Human Rights Commission, said Romania's communist
authorities told him Friday that they consider the probe
``worthless.''
   Romania has come under international fire for the treatment of
its Hungarian minority and plans by President Nicolae Ceausescu _
apparently shelved now _ to raze thousands of villages in a ``rural
consolidation'' program.
   Romania, the first communist country subjected to special
scrutiny by the Human Rights Commission, is not alone in barring its
envoys. Iran refuses them entry, as did Afghanistan for years.
Israel has denied U.N.-mandated human rights investigators access to
the occupied Arab territories.
   Voyame told reporters he plans to travel to Hungary to interview
Romanian refugees there and expects to submit his report by December
as scheduled. The Human Rights Commission is due to debate the
report at its annual meeting next February.
   Voyame said he has gathered information so far from private human
rights groups and Romanian refugees in Switzerland.

<TEXT>
   The question of whether Brig. Gen. S.L.A. Marshall
fabricated data in his book about U.S. soldiers under fire is
central to a debate raging between his critics and his grandson.
   In the renowned historian's 1947 ``Men Against Fire,'' Marshall
stated that as few as 15 percent of American infantry soldiers in
World War II fired their weapons, for a variety of factors including
paralyzing fear.
   The ``firing ratio'' finding led historians to change their
emphasis in studying combat from the perspective of the commander to
that of the common soldier, and helped prompt the U.S. military to
modify infantry training for the Korean and Vietnam wars.
   ``We think in a new way about combat because of Marshall,'' said
Fredric Smoler, a historian at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville,
N.Y.
   But Smoler wrote in the March issue of American Heritage magazine
that Marshall's findings were merely a theory he had derived from
anecdotal evidence, and not based on the authoritative study that
Marshall claimed.
   Marshall's thesis may have been based on evidence he ``made up,''
Smoler wrote.
   Marshall's grandson, John Marshall, entered the fray late in May
with a three-part series in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that
defended his ancestor's thesis and questioned the research of his
detractors.
   Marshall, a reporter for the newspaper, spent four weeks
interviewing his grandfather's colleagues and searching archives.
   The younger Marshall fell out with his grandfather during the
Vietnam War when he was given an honorable discharge from the Army
as a conscientious objector. In an interview last week, he said he
conducted the investigation of his grandfather's work ``as a
reporter, not a defender.''
   ``American Heritage raised questions of methodology but they
haven't refuted his basic thesis. The bigger issue is, was he right
or was he wrong?'' John Marshall said.
   S.L.A. Marshall, who died in 1977, wrote 30 books over his career
as a reporter for The Detroit News and as military historian. Among
his works are ``Pork Chop Hill,'' about the Korean war battle, and
the American Heritage history of World War I.
   But his most important contribution was the ``firing ratio,''
which he said was based on 400 to 600 post-battle interviews with
U.S. soldiers in Europe in World War II.
   Harold B. Leinbaugh, a World War II infantry company commander
and author, felt S.L.A. Marshall's work maligned American soldiers
and conducted the research that initially questioned the basis of
Marshall's hypothesis.
   The research by Leinbaugh and Roger Spiller, a historian at the
Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.,
showed no statistical evidence existed to back up Marshall's claim
that most soldiers didn't fire in battle, Smoler wrote.
   ``It all pivoted on the fact that (Marshall) said he had the
statistical evidence to back it up. ... We're saying he didn't have
the numbers to back himself up,'' said Richard Snow, managing editor
of American Heritage.
   Spiller said he was doing research at the S.L.A. Marshall
Military History Collection at the University of Texas in El Paso
for a possible biography of Marshall and found no evidence of the
studies Marshall said he conducted.
   ``I would have been satisfied with tickmarks on a page of rough
notes ... but I did not find some indication that he had done what
he said he had done,'' Spiller said in a telephone interview.
   Spiller also interviewed John G. Westover, a retired Western
Illinois University professor of history and Marshall's assistant
during his World War II research, who said he didn't recall
conversations with Marshall on the subject.
   Westover said Marshall ``did not have the statistical evidence''
a social scientist would require to back the thesis.
   ``The statistics are made up out of the whole cloth, but the
truth is there,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Spiller said he disagreed with John Marshall and Westover in
accepting ``impressionistic evidence'' as the basis for the theory.
   ``That's like saying it may not be the truth but it ought to
be,'' he said, adding, ``I use his books in class and will continue
to do so, but in a different way.''

<HEAD>Bastille Celebrations: Champagne Race, Frenchmen Honored, French

   In Paris, Texas, two French visitors became instant celebrities.
Philadelphia waiters raced with champagne. And passengers at a New
York City airport received loaves of French bread.
   Thousands of Americans on Friday celebrated the French's
bicentennial of Bastille Day. It marked the July 14, 1789, storming
of the Bastille prison in Paris, the start of the French Revolution.
   But the celebration in Paris, Texas, beginning Friday and lasting
through the weekend, opened with a problem _ no French
representatives.
   Linda Suarez of the Paris Chamber of Commerce said she couldn't
lure French officials to the northeast Texas town of 27,000 for the
celebration, which includes a bike race called the Tour de Paris.
   So when French residents Jean Claud Savouret, 57, and Dennis
Perraut, 38, arrived at the festivities, they became honored guests.
   ``They'll be our special ambassadors,'' Suarez said after meeting
the two, who were visiting friends in the area.
   Said Perraut: ``I feel glad for us as Frenchmen to celebrate in
Paris, Texas.''
   In Philadelphia, 115 waiters and waitresses carrying full bottles
of champagne ran 11 blocks, opened the bubbly and served it with
style to a panel of judges. They were after a free trip to France.
   Competitors, who also carried a glass of water and a French flag,
had to finish with the water glass at least half-full and the
champagne bottle intact.
   Ali Niknam, 37, won. John Rojas, 23, a Colombian native, was
second.
   ``I ran for the Spanish people in Philadelphia,'' Rojas said.
   Passengers at a LaGuardia Airport terminal got loaves of French
bread and the Parks Department presented ``Les Inconsolables,'' an
accordian-and-torch song group, in New York City's celebration.
   Cast members from the Broadway musicals ``Les Miserables'' and
``Phantom of the Opera'' attended a Bastille Day luncheon to benefit
a soup kitchen.
   There was one Bastille Day controversy in New York, though: An
American artist harboring a 13-year grudge burned a French flag in
front of the French Consulate. Richard Lance Corey said he was
protesting treatment of artists at an exhibit in Paris held in
December 1975 and January 1976.
   And in Chicago, the Chicago Surrealist Group passed out leaflets
denouncing the anniversary events as ``a trivialization of an
important landmark of human freedom.''
   One French-owned hotel in a Chicago suburb featured a giant
guillotine made of cream puffs and a sugar model of the Bastille at
its bicentennial celebration.
   In Wyoming, three French climbers on Friday ascended the Grand
Teton, the three peaks that cap the Teton Range. Mountain guide Art
Peters said the Bastille Day climb was a joint project with three
Americans climbing in Chamonix and Mount Blanc, France.
   Peters said the Tetons were first discovered by French fur
trappers in the early 1800s who named them ``Les Troix Tetons,''
meaning the three breasts.
   Farther west, at Hollywood Park racetrack in Inglewood, Calif.,
organizers of a bicentennial celebration on Sunday continued to
build a 50-foot-high layer cake.
   The cake, which was to be attached to a frame today, was to
include two models of Paris' Arc de Triomphe stacked atop one
another, with a version of the Eiffel Tower across the arcs.
   ``I think it's the largest cake you can build without a
foundation system,'' said architect David Davis, one of its
designers. Originally, the cake was planned for 100 feet, but that
would have required a building permit.

<HEAD>UFO Watchers, Other Fringe Politicians Take to The Airwaves</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A political party that wants better relations with
other planets and a wrestler who believes sports is the key to world
peace have captured the fancy of voters wearied by the scandals of
mainstream politicians.
   Half the seats in the upper house of parliament are at stake this
month, and the dominant political party is working overtime trying
to clean up its image and raise its approval ratings by promising
reforms.
   Meanwhile, a variety of fringe parties are taking advantage of
the disenchantment with the governing Liberal Democratic Party and
the law that liberally allocates the airwaves to political campaigns.
   Under the Public Office Election Law, any party producing 10
members who pay $29,000 each as ``guarantee money'' can claim at
least 14 minutes on the Japan Broadcasting Corp. channel and
additional radio time, reaching a potential audience of 122 million.
   The UFO Party, offering nine candidates, has qualified for four
free television appearances and two radio broadcasts. So has the
Sports Peace Party and the Slash-the-Number-of-Parliamentarians
Party.
   The Miscellaneous People's Party, which advocates gay rights,
earned two television appearances and one radio broadcast.
   About 34 of the so-called mini-parties are supporting candidates
in the July 23 elections for 126 seats in the upper house.
   Although most candidates read their speeches on a staid
blue-and-gray set with a dull monotone and a deadpan look, some have
mastered the medium of television.
   Haruzo Hanawa, 73-year-old head of the New Sun Party for the
Extermination of AIDs and Sexual Disease, sang a self-composed
ditty. His song called for legalizing prostitution, and he exhorted
young people to develop sexual morality.
   Towering former wrestler Antonio Inoki of the Sports Peace Party
told voters: ``Violence isn't necessary, but a leader should have a
certain kind of energy.''
   Inoki's platform stresses the achievement of world peace through
international sports exchanges. The ex-grappler is perhaps best
known outside Japan for his widely ridiculed exhibition match 13
years ago with former boxing great Muhammad Ali.
   The head of the Slash-the-Number-of-Parliamentarians Party, Kikuo
Suda, began his speech with, ``Don't you think there are too many
parliament members? If we did it the way they do in the United
States, we would have only 50 members in the (252-member) upper
house.''
   The UFO party has spent its air time calling for a comprehensive
policy to deal with unidentified flying objects, announcing that the
British ambassador told them Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had a
strong interest in the subject.
   The Japan Youth Association, an ultra-right group, was
represented by Toyohisa Eto, who argued against Japan's anti-war
constitution and against opening Japan's markets to farm exports.
   The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, are struggling with the Recruit
Co. influence-peddling scandal that forced the resignation of former
Prime Minister Norobu Takeshita. His successor, Sousuke Uno, has
been fending off allegations about his relationship with a geisha
and the fallout from a sales tax his party backed that has angered
consumers.
   The Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan for 34 years, are
suffering unprecedented disapproval ratings.

<HEAD>Delaware Judge Refuses To Block Time-Warner Buyout; Paramount To
Appeal</HEAD>

   The fate of Paramount Communications Inc.'s
hostile $12.2 billion bid for Time Inc. rests with the Delaware
Supreme Court after a judge refused to block Time's $14 billion
tender offer for Warner Communications Inc.
   The Supreme Court agreed late Friday to hear the case after
Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen turned down a request by
Paramount and some of Time's biggest shareholders for an injunction
against Time's bid for Warner.
   Allen halted Time's $70 a share offer, which had been scheduled
to expire at midnight Monday, for 10 days to give Paramount time to
appeal his ruling. If Paramount loses, it will pave the way for Time
and Warner to merge, forming Time Warner Inc., the world's largest
communications concern.
   Paramount, which is offering $200 a share for Time, has said it
would not pursue a buyout of Time Warner.
   Time called Allen's decision, ``a very big step toward making
Time Warner Inc. a reality.''
   Allen rejected Paramount's contention that Time directors put the
company up for sale by agreeing to a friendly merger with Warner
last March.
   ``There has never been the slightest subjective interest in
selling to or submerging Time into another entity,'' Allen wrote in
a 79-page decision.
   The judge agreed with Time's argument that the proposed merger
with Warner was the culmination of two years of negotiations, and as
such represented a long-term business decision.
   Allen said he concluded the plaintiffs hadn't shown a reasonable
probability that they possessed the right to require Time's board to
abandon or delay the Warner transaction.
   Time is offering to pay $70 a share in cash for half of Warner's
200 million outstanding shares and later exchange $70 in cash and
securities for each of the remaining shares.
   Time stock fell $4.75 a share to $145.25 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange after having dipped as low as $138 a share.
   Warner stock rose $2 a share to $64.25 and Paramount slipped 12{
cents to $57.50 a share.
   Allen heard arguments from both sides during a 5{-hour hearing
Tuesday.
   Attorneys for Paramount and the shareholders _ who included Texas
investor Robert M. Bass _ claimed Time's directors violated their
duty by refusing to let shareholders vote on Paramount's bid and the
tender offer for Warner.
   The attorneys said the Time and Warner boards knew they were
opening the companies up to outside bids by deciding to merge and
Time must therefore seriously consider Paramount's offer.
   Allen agreed with the Time and Warner contention that Time's
directors did not violate their duty to shareholders.
   Time and Warner announced their original stock-swap merger
agreement March 4. The companies planned to submit the plan to
shareholders, but amended the agreement in June _ after Paramount
made its original $175 a share bid _ to provide for Time's $70 a
share tender offer.
   A vote was required on the original agreement because it involved
the issuing of more Time shares, but an acquisition did not require
a vote, the lawyers argued.
   Time's board has rejected Paramount's bid as financially
inadequate and too conditional to be viable. Time also has accused
Paramount of undertaking the bid solely to destroy the competitive
advantage Time Warner would have over Paramount.
   Allen's decision and the final outcome of the case have been
anxiously awaited by other companies that might be contemplating
friendly mergers of their own.
   Many of the nation's largest companies are incorporated in
Delaware _ like Time, Paramount and Warner _ and are subject to its
laws.
   Allen disagreed with a claim by Paramount and the shareholders
that Time had put itself up for sale in their initial merger
agreement on the grounds the current Warner shareholders would end
up holding more than 60 percent of the stock in Time Warner.

<HEAD>$6.3 Million High School Donation To Provide Scholarship Help</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A family whose bean farm on the edge
of the Everglades was sold for nearly $23 million donated about a
third of the cash to a high school scholarship fund.
   ``I can't think of anything more important than getting the kids
an education. We just have to educate our kids properly,'' said Jack
Butler during a brief ceremony Friday at which he presented the $6.4
million endowment to Deerfield Beach High School.
   The school was singled out to receive a third of the income from
the sale of the land in the wills of Butler's aunt and uncle, James
and Alice Butler, pioneer farmers who came to South Florida in 1910.
   James Butler died in 1965. Mrs. Butler, who died in 1976,
believed the sale of the 400-acre farm would reap about $250,000.
   But rapid growth in South Florida has inflated land prices in the
area about 12 miles northwest of Fort Lauderdale. American National
Development Corp. of Coral Springs acquired the property June 22 and
plans to build home subdivisions.
   ``We knew the property was worth a lot more than Aunt Alice
thought,'' said Butler, 72, who farmed the land until 1985. ``We
just wanted to farm it, pay the bills and keep it free and clear
from debt until the time was right.''
   Butler said the 1,600-student school also will receive a third of
some other farm assets still to be sold.
   School officials knew of the will's provisions for years, but
were stunned by the amount of the gift.
   Principal Ronald Clodfelter said many students who might not have
considered college could now do so with grants from the fund. He
said the school will form a scholarship committee to oversee the
funds and determine how they will be allocated.
   Under present rates, the yearly interest from the endowment would
be more than $500,000, said David Moyar, a vice president at
Southeast Bank, which is handling the funds.
   ``Alice and James wanted to do a lot for the high school,'' said
George Patterson, an attorney for the Butlers' estate. ``She was
adamant about the school.''

<HEAD>South Korea Calls Off Sports Talks With North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government accused communist North
Korea today of trying to stir unrest in South Korea and called off
talks on fielding a joint team at the 1990 Asian Games in China.
   In a letter to North Korea, South Korea canceled talks planned
for Tuesday at the border truce village of Panmunjom.
   The letter accused North Korea of slander and ``hostile political
maneuvering'' aimed at causing civil unrest in South Korea, but said
South Korea hoped talks would be resumed soon.
   The cancellation reflected the souring relations between the
countries over a series of illegal visits by South Koreans to the
north.
   Trips to North Korea without prior government approval are a
crime in South Korea. The government maintains that all contacts and
dialogue with the North must be made through official channels.
   The last sports meeting, the second in a series, was held in
March, but North Korea had refused to resume the talks until
recently.
   The two Koreas have tried to improve relations through a series
of talks that began in 1988, although little progress has been made,
with each side insisting on its own initiatives.
   Contacts grew chillier earlier this year when North Korea
demanded that South Korea cancel annual military exercises with the
United States
   Seoul since postponed other talks, including those on a
long-planned meeting between lawmakers from both nations, and
accused North Korea of encouraging secret visits by South Koreans to
stir up problems in the South.
   Moon Ik-hwan, a Presbyterian minister who made an unauthorized
visit to North Korea in March to see North Korean leader Kim Il
Sung, has been jailed on charges of violating national security laws.
   A student defied the Seoul government and attended an
international youth festival, which ended last weekend in Pyongyang,
triggering crackdowns on radical students in South Korea.
   An opposition lawmaker was arrrested June 28 for making a secret
trip to North Korea in August. Nine other people have been jailed
for failing to report the lawmaker to authorities.

   The FBI said the four people charged this week with
developing rockets for the Irish Republican Army represent the
group's ``main cogs'' in efforts to build sophisticated new weapons.
   Agents arrested three of the suspected IRA technical experts
Wednesday, and later seized radar and missile parts during raids in
Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, the FBI said Friday.
An arrest warrant was issued for a fourth, who the FBI believes has
gone into hiding in Ireland.
   Investigators say the four were working for the Provisional IRA,
the guerrilla wing of the nationalist group fighting to end British
rule in Northern Ireland.
   The four face federal charges of conspiring to injure and destroy
the property of a foreign government, which carries a penalty of up
to three years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
   Among the items confiscated in raids Wednesday and Thursday on
two apartments in Bethlehem, Pa., were 6-foot-long missile launching
tubes and a videotape showing one of the suspects firing a rocket,
the FBI said.
   A raid on a house in Nashua, N.H., yielded technical documents on
missiles and British helicopters, and a search of a house in
Harwich, on Cape Cod, turned up enough radar parts and electronic
gear to fill a station wagon, the FBI said.
   ``It appears quite clear that they were doing a two-fold
operation: building a radar deliverance system, and developing
rocket technology aimed at something _ and the something appears at
the very least to be British helicopters,'' said James F. Ahearn,
special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office at a news
conference Friday.
   Ahearn said the ability to manufacture radar-guided missiles
would have added significant firepower to the IRA's campaign against
the British.
   Arrested were Richard Clark Johnson, 41, of Nashua, N.H.; Martin
Peter Quigley, 27, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland who has been
living since April in Bethlehem, Pa.; and Christina Leigh Reid, 25,
of Sunnyvale, Calif.
   The fourth suspect was identified as Irish citizen Peter Eamonn
Maguire.
   ``We do believe that the main cogs in the wheel, so to speak,
have been identified,'' Ahearn said.
   Wayne A. Budd, U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, said a grand jury
is expected to consider other charges against the four, including
violations of the Arms Export Control Act and aiding a foreign
insurrectionary group, both of which carry prison sentences of up to
10 years.
   Johnson and Quigley were being held by the U.S. Marshal's Service
in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, respectively.
   Johnson held a top secret security clearance as an electrical
engineer for The Mitre Corp. in Bedford. Ahearn said there was no
evidence that anything Johnson did at Mitre materially contributed
to this case.
   Reid was released on $10,000 bail Thursday, and a hearing was set
for Aug. 8 to move her case to Boston, where Budd said he expects
all three defendants to go on trial.
   Ahearn said the arrests resulted from an investigation that began
in 1981 and is continuing. He said the FBI decided to arrest the
defendants on short notice Wednesday after they realized they were
under surveillance.
   He refused to say how they found out.

<HEAD>Government Says 10 Killed, 32 Injured in Mogadishu Clash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The capital of Somalia was reported calm
today, one day after state radio said 10 people were killed and 32
injured when security forces opened fire on locals who attacked them
with stones, knives and sticks.
   The clash broke out Friday near a mosque in a neighborhood of
western Mogadishu, according to Somali state radio.
   The casualties included ``troublemakers'' and members of the
security forces, according to a state radio broadcast monitored in
Nairobi, Somalia's western neighbor.
   A resident contacted by telephone Friday said it appeared troops
had opened fire as Moslem worshipers left their place of prayer.
Islam is the state religion in the impoverished East African nation
of about 9 million.
   The resident, who spoke on condition he not be identified
further, said gunfire erupted around midday in the capital on the
shores of the Indian Ocean and continued sporadically through the
afternoon.
   Residents contacted by telex from Nairobi said life in Mogadishu
appeared to have returned to normal today and that a 6 p.m. to 6
a.m. curfew imposed Friday was lifted.
   A statement by the Somali Interior Ministry, broadcast over state
radio late Friday, said a group of ``troublemakers hiding behind the
banner of religion'' caused the disturbances.
   Security forces tried to contain the situation peacefully, but
opened fire after the ``troublemakers'' attacked them with stones,
knives and sticks, according to the government statement.
   Ten people were killed and 32 wounded in the clash with
casualties on both sides of the violence, said the statement.
   Friday is normally the Moslem Sabbath but July 14 also was the
occasion for feast and celebration of the hajj, the Moslem
faithfuls' pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca.
   There were reports during the week that several Moslem religious
leaders had been picked up by the authorities, but it was not known
whether the alleged detentions had anything to do with Friday's
violence. Further information on the reported arrests was not
available.
   Last Sunday, an unidentified gunman shot to death Mogadishu's
Roman Catholic Bishop Salvatore Pietro Colombo. It also was not
known whether the disturbances were connected to that incident.
There are an estimated 2,000 Roman Catholics in Somalia.
   Somalia, on the horn of East Africa that juts into the Indian
Ocean, has been led since 1969 by the autocratic President Mohamed
Siad Barre as a one-party state.
   Since 1981, Somalia has battled the Somali National Movement, a
northern insurgency that demands Barre's removal. Intensified
fighting between the insurgents and the government over the last 18
months has driven more than 200,000 Somalis into refugee camps in
neighboring Ethiopia.

<HEAD>Jury Says Dairy Wasn't to Blame for Jalisco Deadly Cheese Outbreak</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jurors absolved a raw milk supplier from
liability for nearly $100 million in unsettled claims from a 1985
listeriosis outbreak, in a decision that could limit compensation
for some victims.
   The jurors Friday said that Alta-Dena Certified Dairy could not
be held liable for a soft cheese produced with its milk. The cheese,
made by Jalisco Mexican Products Inc., was laden with the listeria
bacteria.
   The bacteria killed 48 people and caused birth defects and other
ailments in dozens more.
   ``I feel the lord has answered our prayers,'' said Alta-Dena
founder Harold Stueve, 71. ``We had nothing to do with this case in
the first place.''
   Jalisco, which has since gone out of business, had claimed that
Alta-Dena sold it tainted milk.
   But Alta-Dena's lawyer, Raymond Novell, told the jury that
bacteria was never found in the dairy's milk or herds, noting
Alta-Dena supplied 26 million gallons of milk to 30 wholesale
customers during the period in question and only Jalisco had an
outbreak of listeriosis.
   ``This was strictly an issue between the two companies,'' Novell
said after the 11-1 verdict. ``Jalisco looked around for deep
pockets and sued us.''
   Victims of the outbreak and their families wanted Alta-Dena to
share responsibility.
   ``Jalisco had a small insurance policy to begin with _ about $10
million _ almost three-fourths of which has already been depleted in
settlements of claims,'' said attorney Kim Miller, who represents
claimants.
   ``A lot of the significantly injured plaintiffs will have to take
small compensations,'' she said. ``There will not be enough funds to
properly compensate these victims from Jalisco or its insurance
proceeds.''

<HEAD>Party Boss Calls For More Ideological Education</HEAD>

   Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin called for more
ideological education to shield young people from the influences of
Western culture, official media reported today.
   Jiang, at a meeting Friday on higher education also attended by
Premier Li Peng, said educators must take a clear stand against
``bourgeois liberalization'' in the wake of the student-led movement
for democratic reform.
   Meanwhile, staff at the Jianguo Hotel and several other
well-known Beijing hotels said officials from the China National
Publications Import and Export Corp., a state company, on Friday
removed all foreign magazines and newspapers from their stands.
   Several other hotels, including the Sheraton Great Wall, the
Holiday Inn and the Palace, also said foreign periodicals had been
confiscated. The hotels said the Chinese officials gave no reason
for confiscating the publications.
   Hotels are among the few places Chinese have access to foreign
news accounts of the crackdown on dissent in China, which have
differed greatly with the government's version. Satellite reception
of TV news from the United States, including CNN, were cut off at
several hotels earlier this month.
   On Friday, the official press reported the government was
planning a sweep on the nation's bookstores to removal publications
written by scholars wanted by police for participating in the
pro-democracy movement.
   The military crushed the movement in an attack on Beijing on June
3-4 after the government declared it had become a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' against the socialist system.
   Jiang, the party's general secretary, said the rebellion backed
up statements by senior leader Deng Xiaoping that China's most
serious fault in recent years was neglecting ideological education.
   ``Quite a number of young people have been greatly influenced by
Western culture and ideology in recent years, yet we have slackened
correct ideological education among them. As a result, they are not
mentally prepared to face the hardships and complexities in the
socialist construction and the reform,'' the official Xinhua News
Agency quoted him as saying.
   University students already have been told they will have
additional mandatory classes in ideology this fall. The Beijing
Daily reported this week that summer vacation programs have been
arranged for primary and middle school students to educate them in
loving the Communist Party, socialism, the motherland and the
People's Liberation Army.
   It said military officers will give lectures to children on the
rebellion and children will visit martial law troops and the
families of soldiers killed by protesters resisting their advance
into the city.
   Jiang also gave backhanded praise to intellectuals, who had
expressed support for the democratic movement.
   He said they were the ``gem of the nation'' but that
``intellectuals have their shortcomings and we should help them to
have a better understanding through education and studies.''
   He said dissident Fang Lizhi, who has sought refuge in the U.S.
Embassy and is wanted for purported counterrevolutionary crimes,
``and his like are scum of the Chinese intellectuals and very few in
number.''
   Jiang was appointed party chief on June 24 when the party purged
Zhao Ziyang, who had sympathized with some of the students' demands.
Zhao, stripped of all his party posts, has not been seen since May
19.
   Li Ruihuan, a member of the powerful Politburo Standing
Committee, noted that China's two latest bouts of bourgeois
liberalization, or flirtation with Western culture, began with
student demonstrations. The government also launched a campaign
against bourgeois liberalization after student demonstrations in the
winter of 1986-87.
   ``This fact poses a problem for us and we should make a thorough
study on how to run the schools well,'' he said.
   Also Friday, the U.S. Senate voted 81-10 to impose economic
sanctions on China and to urge President Bush to take even harsher
measures.
   The legislation, passed as an amendment to a pending State
Department appropriations bill, adopts several sanctions passed
earlier by the House. It requires Bush to suspend several trade
programs but gives him the flexibility to stop any program
suspension.
   The legislation includes six-month suspensions of trade insurance
by the Overseas Private Investment Corp. and the use of U.S. funds
to support China trade.
   The Senate also adopted non-binding suggestions in which they
urged Bush to take stiffer steps, including reviewing all trade
agreements between the countries.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in Paris with Bush for a
summit of the seven leading industrial nations, said the
administration would consider the legislation but that the
president's current response to the crackdown has been appropriate.

   China and Mongolia formally restored long-severed
party ties during a visit to Ulan Bator by a Chinese Communist Party
delegation, the official Xinhua News Agency reported today.
   In a dispatch from the Mongolian capital, Xinhua said Mongolian
leader Zhambyn Batmonkh praised the normalization of party links
during a meeting Friday with Zhu Liang, head of the International
Liaison Department of China's Communist Party.
   China and its sparsely populated northern neighbor recently
emerged from almost three decades of icy relations caused by the
split in 1960 between China and the Soviet Union.
   Mongolia, a close ally of Moscow, effectively suspended all
contacts with Beijing and invited Soviet troops into the country to
patrol its lengthy border with China.
   The warming of relations has generally followed the improvement
in ties beween China and the Soviet Union. Last May, while Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev was visiting China, the Soviets began the
second stage of a two-year withdrawal of 50,000 troops _ 75 percent
of its forces stationed in Mongolia.
   In March, Tserenpilyn Gombosuren became Mongolia's first foreign
minister ever to visit China.
   Xinhua said Batmonkh expressed understanding for the recent
change in China's party leadership, referring to the ouster of
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who was accused of being soft on the
recent student-led pro-democracy movement.

   A federal judge has agreed to hear the case of
a teen-age Nevada beauty queen who has filed a lawsuit to enter a
national pageant under way in California.
   Heather Anne McLeod sued the operators of the Miss Teen USA
pageant in San Bernardino, Calif., after she was disqualified for
allegedly breaking the rules by competing in both Nevada and
California Miss Teen contests the same year.
   U.S. District Judge Roger Foley said Friday he would review Ms.
McLeod's case Tuesday, one day before preliminary competition begins
in the national Miss Teen USA contest, with $150,000 in prizes for
the winner.
   Karen Gee, a spokeswoman for the national pageant, wouldn't say
whether it's too late for Ms. McLeod to join the contest if a judge
rules in her favor. Taping began Friday for the swimsuit competition
portion of the test. The show's finale is July 25.
   Ms. McLeod's attorney said the 18-year-old wants $200,000 in
damages if she is barred from the contest, to make up for the
``extreme mental anxiety, public humiliation, personal
embarrassment, public ridicule, and loss of reputation'' she will
suffer.
   The attorney, Charles Zeh, unsuccessfully sought a temporary
restraining order Thursday ``in hopes of getting a hearing and an
order as quickly as possible to get her into the contest.''
   ``Heather is here waiting ... time is of the essence,'' he said.
   The University of Nevada-Reno psychology student, who attended
high school in San Diego, was disqualifed from the national contest
June 30 after winning the Nevada pageant June 22 in Las Vegas. She
earlier had taken part in the California state contest.
   Zeh contends Ms. McLeod wasn't told she could be disqualified for
competing in both California and Nevada pageants and wasn't given a
copy of the rules.
   Stacey Bentley, 18, who finished second in the Miss Nevada Teen
contest, has taken Ms. McLeod's place in preliminary activities of
the Miss Teen USA competition.
   As far as the Miss Teen USA officials are concerned, Ms. Gee
said, ``Heather McLeod is not the Miss Nevada Teen delegate; the
Miss Nevada Teen delegate is down here competing.''

<HEAD>Soviet Officials Report Losses from Spreading Coal Strikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spreading strikes in the Kuzbass coal region of
Siberia are causing heavy economic losses, newspapers reported today
as officials appealed to miners in at least nine cities to return to
work.
   Settlements were reported with miners in two cities,
Mezhdurechinsk and Osiniki, but strikes elsewhere have spread, the
reports said.
   Soviet newspapers described a chaotic situation in the Kuzbass,
an important coal-producing region about 1,600 miles east of Moscow.
It supplies fuel to the metallurgical industries in the Ural
Mountains to the west.
   Thousands of miners and their families were said to be meeting in
town squares throughout the coal-producing basin to protest harsh
living and working conditions.
   Authorities reported an end to the strike Thursday, but miners
expanded their demands from economic issues, such as food, housing
and health care, to broader demands for political change, Soviet
reports said.
   The crisis was sharpest in the town of Prokopevsk, where
production was virtually halted, the Communist Party newspaper
Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya reported in a dispatch from Kemerov
Oblast in the Kuzbass.
   ``Events in the Kuzbass have taken a sharp turn,'' the newspaper
reported. Although miners returned to work in Mezhdurechensk, in
other mining towns in the basin ``the situation has sharply
intensified.''
   Mining Minister Mikhail I. Shchadov was in the area, rushing from
mine to mine, ``spending many hours speaking to the strikers'' and
trying to end the stoppage, the newspaper said.
   In addition to the agreement reached in Mezhdurechensk, where the
strike began Tuesday, authorities also reached a settlement with
miners in Osiniki, according to Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya and
Pravda, another party newspaper.
   Strikes continued at Prokopevsk; at Kisilevsk, five out of 10
mines were on strike; two mines were on strike at Lenin-Kuznets; in
Kemerov, the administrative center of the region, the Severnaya and
Butovkskaya mines were on strike; miners were striking in
Novokuznetsk, according to the newspaper reports.
   Miners in Byelov and Anzhero-Sudzhesk continued to work, but
still made demands on authorities, the reports said. Reports said
miners in nine cities were striking, although the published lists
did not match.
   The reports said that despite a rather chaotic situation, rife
with rumors, miners' strike committees that formed Friday were
keeping social order.
   ``At their demand, sales of liquor were stopped and narcotics
control points were established along highways,'' Pravda reported in
a dispatch from its correspondent at the scene.
   It said that on Thursday in Novokuznetsk and on Friday in
Kemerov, ``efforts were made by the so-called `Democratic Union' and
several other informal organizations to spread anti-Soviet slogans,
but they received a resolute rebuff.''
   Authorities throughout the region tried to talk the miners back
to work.
   ``Democracy means not only rights, but also responsbility,
discipline and organization,'' Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya warned.
   Strikes were once hushed up and brutally suppressed in the Soviet
Union, where they were considered a Western phenomenon resulting
from capitalist exploitation. This year, however, coal strikes have
generally ended after several days with government concessions.
   Last March, more than 100 coal miners in the Ural city of Vorkuta
struck to protest increased work orders. In April, miners stayed
underground in the Siberian city of Norilsk to demand a 30 percent
wage increase.
   Twenty-four miners are reported to be staying underground in
Alexandria in the Ukraine with demands similar to their Kuzbass
counterparts.

<HEAD>CFTC Will Investigate CBOT Actions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commodities Futures Trading Commission says it
will review the trading positions of Chicago Board of Trade
directors to see if any of them profited from the drop in soybean
prices precipitated by their emergency order earlier this week.
   The CFTC made the announcement Friday as Italian agribusiness
giant Ferruzzi said it would renew its court battle to recover
losses from a Board of Trade order forcing soybean traders to
liquidate large positions in the market.
   Raul Gardini, chairman of Ferruzzi Finanzaria SpA, reiterated in
Milan that his company's accumulation of futures contracts to take
delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans was legal.
   A Feruzzi spokesman said a lawsuit probably would be filed in
Chicago, but did not provide a timetable. The company also indicated
it might seek compensation for unrealized profits as well as damage
to its reputation.
   On Thursday, U.S. District Judge James Zaghel denied a request by
two of the company's subsidiaries _ Ferruzzi Trading International
SA and Ferruzzi USA Inc. _ for a restraining order and a permanent
injunction ending the directive issued Tuesday by the CBOT.
   Zagel told CBOT attorneys to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit
by Tuesday, with a response due July 24.
   Gardini didn't specify the amount of losses Ferruzzi suffered as
a result of the board's order, which required all traders to reduce
their July contract soybean holdings to 1 million bushels by the
close of trading Thursday.
   CBOT directors have said they issued the liquidation order
because the open July soybean contracts totaled about 40 million
bushels and there were abnormally low levels of stocks available to
satisfy the contracts _ a situation that would have resulted in a
number of defaults without the exchange's intervention.
   Any player with a large enough share of the market _ a position
referred to as ``cornering the market'' _ theoretically could force
those on the other end of its futures contracts to deliver, possibly
causing a scramble for supplies that would drive the price of its
soybeans up sharply.
   Soybean prices for July delivery rose 6 cents to $7.03{ a bushel
on Friday. Despite the gain, the price was still well below $7.26 a
bushel, the level at which July soybeans settled on Tuesday before
the Board of Trade's directive.
   ``Ferruzzi and all major world traders are convinced that the
board made a mistake and has to suffer the consequences,'' Gardini
said about the potential lawsuit.
   Ferruzzi has said it accumulated large soybean supplies to keep
its processing plants running and to meet export commitments, and
also that its large futures market position was a hedge against
price fluctuations.
   In Washington, the CFTC said it would review the trading
positions of exchange directors and the minutes of the meeting at
which the decision was made to force liquidation of soybean
contracts.
   Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann has said that none of
those involved in the decision held a position in the soybean market
when they voted to issue the emergency order.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, expressed concern over the actions taken by
the Board of Trade.
   ``There have been serious allegations that there may have been an
effort to manipulate the soybean futures market,'' he said ``I will
insist on a full and rigorous investigation of any wrongdoing and
that the perpetrators be punished to full extent of the law.
   ``If reforms are necessary to prevent these types of
manipulations, I will insist on making them when this issue comes
before my committee later this year.''
   The Agriculture Committee oversees the CFTC, which is up for
reauthorization this year.

   Strong thunderstorms stretched from New Mexico to the central
Plains and whipped parts of Oregon and Idaho, while cool Canadian
air chilled many parts of the East.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to 60 mph and toppled trees at
Lovington, N.M., on Friday, an airplane was flipped over at an
airport near Hobbs and power lines were downed in and around
Portales.
   Winds also tore the roof off a building at Logan and boats and
boathouses were damaged at Ute Lake. Hail the size of dimes covered
the ground and halted traffic on Interstate 40 west of Santa Rosa.
   In northern Kansas, high winds downed trees and damaged grain
bins at Logan. Streets flooded in Stockton, where three inches of
rain fell within an hour, and flooding also occurred along the south
fork of the Solomon River.
   Three inches of rain also fell in an hour at Trumball, Neb., and
heavy rains washed out roads near Cairo and caused nearby Dry Creek
to overflow its banks.
   Thunderstorm winds also buffeted eastern Oregon and northern
Idaho. Winds gusted to 64 mph at Baker, Ore., and blew down trees
near Marsing and Homedale, Idaho.
   Thunderstorm rains deluged extreme southern Louisiana, flooding
streets in downtown Lake Charles.
   Other thunderstorms were over southern Oklahoma, north-central
Texas, and along a stationary front from central Mississippi to the
South Carolina coast.
   High pressure over Lake Superior brought cool air to the upper
Great Lakes, the central Appalachians and northern New England,
where overnight temperatures were in the 40s and 50s. Marquette,
Mich., tied its record low for the date late Friday with a reading
of 43 degrees.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
coast of the Carolinas into Florida, and from the eastern and
central Gulf Coast across the lower and middle Mississippi Valley to
the Plains from eastern Texas to South Dakota. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms were forecast for the northern Rockies and sunny skies
were expected elsewhere.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s and 70s along the Pacific
Coast; the 70s from portions of the central Plains and South Dakota
across much of the upper and middle Mississippi Valley, the Great
Lakes and northern Ohio Valley to New England; the 90s across the
Florida Peninsula, and from parts of the lower Mississippi Valley
across Texas and the southern Rockies to much of Arizona, New
Mexico, Nevada, Utah and Idaho; and above 100 degrees across the
Desert Southwest and inland valleys of Southern California. The
remainder of the nation was expected to have highs in the 80s.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 36 degrees at Marquette,
Mich., to 98 degrees at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Relative Hopes Green River Suspect is Killer; Police Sort Through
Belongings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven years after his sister's body was found
along the Green River, one of the first victims in the nation's
worst serial murder case, Garrett Mills says he can only hope police
have the killer.
   Police began sorting through the 1,800 videotapes and 55 cartons
and bags of materials seized from William Jay Stevens II, a former
law student named in court papers as a ``viable suspect'' in the
slayings. The sorting could take a month.
   Stevens has not been charged in the case and he denies any
involvement. His name became public late this week in an affidavit
supporting a search warrant for two Spokane homes used by him.
   The affidavit said he was under investigation in the case and
might be linked to at least 17 other homicide victims whose bodies
were found along highways between Portland and Vancouver, British
Columbia, and between Seattle and Spokane.
   Mills' sister, 16-year-old Opal Charmaine Mills was one of the 40
known Green River victims. Police have blamed the killer for the
disappearance of eight other young women.
   Ranging in age from 15 to 36, the female victims vanished between
July 1982 and early 1984. Of the 40 corpses, 36 were found in the
Seattle area and four near Portland, Ore. Four remain unidentified.
   The case takes its name from the site south of Seattle where the
first five corpses were found in the summer of 1982.
   ``I paid attention a lot at first, but I got tired of getting my
hopes up,'' Mills, 25, said Friday of the investigation.
   He added, ``I hope it's him, but I don't know.''
   Stevens is serving a one-year term in the county jail in Seattle
for the burglary of a police equipment supply store in 1979 and
additional time for walking away from a work-release center in 1981.
   He was rearrested in Spokane on Jan. 10.
   Stevens was found after ``Manhunt,'' a nationally syndicated
television show, aired a program in December about the Green River
killings. One tipster directed investigators to Gonzaga University
Law School in Spokane, where Stevens had attended classes for 3{
years and was president of the student bar.
   ``Whether or not this person is simply the victim of a bizarre
set of circumstances or in fact responsible for some of the crimes
in King County, we don't know yet, and that's exactly what we're
trying to determine by going through the material we recovered with
the warrant,'' Green River Task Force Commander Robert C. Evans said
Friday.
   Stevens, who declined jailhouse interviews, ``is concerned he's
being singled out as the answer to a longtime investigation,'' said
his attorney, Craig Beles.
   ``He feels basically like anybody who is innocent of the offenses
being looked at by the Green River Task Force. He is angry and
frightened,'' said Beles. ``He's a colorful character, but he's no
murderer.''
   No personal items belonging to any Green River victims were found
in Wednesday's searches, Evans said.
   Evans acknowledged the King County Police task force had found
``no smoking gun,'' but he said an initial study of 405 documents
charting Stevens' movements between 1981 and 1989 showed they
sometimes closely paralleled the killings.
   Records seized when he was arrested show he traveled extensively
between Seattle, Portland, Spokane and Vancouver, British Columbia,
under at least four aliases during the period, Evans said.
   After his arrest, Spokane authorities found in searches that
Stevens possessed several police-type vehicles, 26 license plates,
29 firearms and about 100 police badges, investigators said.
   The task force has long suspected the killer could be a police
officer or someone posing as one, Evans said.
   In the affidavit, many who knew Stevens said he liked
pornography, frequented prostitutes and carried photographs of
mutilated women.

<HEAD>Five Trampled to Death in Fire Panic at Mecca Camp</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fire swept through a tent camp
housing Moslems making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, and five
elderly Pakistanis were trampled to death in the ensuing panic,
officials said today.
   Thirty-four others were hurt during the blaze that burned 220
tents Friday in the camp in Mecca, a civil defense official said in
a statement distributed by the Saudi Press Agency.
   The camp was set up by the South Asian Pilgrims Association, a
Pakistani-based organization that arranges travel and accomodations
for Moslems making the pilgrimage to the sacred Moslem city.
   The fire was caused by a flare from a gas cooker being used by
one of the pilgrims, the statement said. The civil defense official
said five elderly Pakistanis were trampled on as the pilgrims fled
the camp.
   Fifteen of the injured remained hospitalized today and the others
were treated and released.
   Such accidents are frequent during the pilgrimage season to
Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina. About 2 million
pilgrims from 80 countries gather for the rituals every year.
   The civil defense statement made it clear that authorities did
not suspect sabotage at the camp.
   Two bombs exploded in Mecca on Monday at the height of the
pilgrimage season. A Pakistani pilgrim was killed and 16 were
wounded in the blasts.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis took more heat for his 1990
budget cuts, which critics say could have been avoided had he acted
swiftly to limit the state's financial troubles a year ago, during
his presidential campaign.
   Demonstrators on Friday poured inside the Statehouse and marched
to the doors of the governor's office chanting: ``No more cuts.''
Dukakis was not in, and they left peacefully about 20 minutes later.
   ``Let's send a message throughout the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts,'' Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn said at the
demonstration. ``We are going to restore some semblance of decency
and respect and compassion for people who need our help.''
   Meanwhile, lawmakers vowed to restore $100 million in state aid
to cities and towns that the governor vetoed to balance the fiscal
1990 budget.
   Dukakis returned to the Statehouse later Friday to face other bad
news: Standard &amp; Poor's dropped Massachusetts' bond rating for the
second time this year. The agency cited financial disarray in
Massachusetts government. The move will add millions to borrowing
costs.
   ``It's not unexpected. ... Had we demonstrated fiscal strength,
we wouldn't have had to do what we did yesterday,'' Dukakis said of
the budget cuts.
   Dukakis defended his 1990 budget cuts as an ``essential part of
getting the state back on track.''
   The governor has come under fire for not acting swiftly when the
state began to run into financial trouble a year ago.
   ``They've been whistling while Rome burned in this
administration,'' said Rep. John Flood, a Democrat who chairs the
House of Representatives Taxation committee.
   ``This is not a surprise to a lot of people,'' Flood said. ``It
was avoidable and the administration chose to ignore the warnings.''
   Dukakis aides also announced the governor was postponing signing
a bill legislators passed early Friday that would impose an income
tax surcharge to make up the 1989 budget deficit and pay outstanding
Medicaid debts. The measure is projected to raise $744 million over
18 months.
   ``He plans to sign it, assuming all the legal and technical
questions are answered,'' said aide Mindy Lubber.
   Citizens for Limited Taxation and other anti-tax advocates say
they'll take the income tax issue to the 1990 ballot to seek a
refund.

   A single-engine plane smashed into a
machine shop shortly after takeoff, killing all three people aboard
and injuring two workers at the shop, authorities said.
   The Walco Tool and Engineering Co., which had about 50 employees
working at the time of the crash, is about a quarter mile from the
runway of Lewis University Airport.
   ``There was this gigantic explosion,'' said Joe Gladkowski, 40, a
machinist at the shop.
   One of the men, a machinist, was listed in serious condition at a
hospital with burns over more than half of his body. Another
employee was treated and released.
   Witnesses said the plane had trouble gaining altitude during
takeoff.
   ``It appeared on takeoff to be unstable and was moving at a low
rate toward its climb,'' said Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman Mort Edelstein. ``Suddenly it took a left turn, went down
behind trees, struck a building and exploded into flames.''
   The Walco building is in a small industrial park located near a
pastoral care center run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Joliet.
   Gladkowski said some employees had just gotten up from eating
lunch at a counter where the passenger section of the plane landed
on the building. The plane struck a solid beam and did not cause
major damage to the building.
   ``It's a blessing more people were not injured,'' said Walco
president David Walsh. ``There could be over a million dollars of
machinery damaged, but that doesn't matter.''

<HEAD>Shiite Clashes, Syrian-Christian Duels Amid Power Blackout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias clashed in
the slums of south Beirut today and Syrian and Christian forces
fought artillery battles across the capital amid a power blackout
caused by fuel shortages.
   Police said one person was killed and four were wounded in the
four-hour clash between the mainstream Shiite Amal militia, which is
backed by Syria, and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The two factions have clashed intermittently since April 1988 as
they vied for dominance of 1.2 million Shiites, the largest single
sect in Lebanon.
   By police count, the new casualties brought the overall toll of
the power struggle to 561 killed and 1,554 wounded.
   Syrian troops deployed in west Beirut sent patrols at 4 a.m. into
the low-income suburbs to disengage the militiamen and enforce a
cease-fire between the secular Amal and the fundamentalist
Hezbollah, a police spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations, said
Syrian gunners in west Beirut sporadically shelled the coast from
east Beirut to the port of Byblos, 28 miles to the north,
maintaining their sea blockade of the Christian heartland.
   He said artillery fire fell around Byblos and Jounieh, another
port about 12{ miles north of Beirut. No casualties were reported.
   Christian gunners of army commander Gen. Michel Aoun fired back
with 155mm guns, targeting positions along west Beirut's seaside
districts.
   The police spokesman said at least one round exploded ``within a
few yards'' of a Syrian artillery emplacement in a deserted soccer
field in the fashionable Manara district.
   ``We don't know if the Syrians suffered any casualties. They
usually evacuate their casualties to their own field hospitals and
clinics which are not under our jurisdiction,'' the police spokesman
said.
   Syria's army command does not comment on losses among its 40,000
soldiers, stationed in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.
   The blockade of the Christian enclave has caused fuel oil
shortages at Beirut's main power generating plant in suburban Zouk.
The sea blockade has prevented shipments from arriving from abroad,
and checkpoints around the enclave obstructed supplies from
refineries in south and north Lebanon.
   The electricity authority announced that as of today its
generators will supply only the main water pumping station in Beirut
and major hospitals and telecommunication switchboards with two
hours of power every 24 hours on rotating basis.
   The public in both sectors of the divided capital and in the
Christian heartland to the north will receive none.
   It was the second time that the city has plunged into total
darkness since the confrontation between Aoun and the Syrians began
March 8. Last month's crisis was resolved after a partial lift of
the land siege.

<TEXT>
   The bicentennial bash in honor of the French
Revolution peaked with a parade that featured moonwalking Americans,
Scottish bagpipers, Soviet tanks spewing confetti and a touching
reminder of the crackdown in China.
   The three days of bicentennial celebrations were to close tonight
at the Eiffel Tower with what was billed as the biggest ever
fireworks display.
   The most offbeat event was the parade Friday night that featured
a moonwalking Florida A&amp;M University marching band, British
firefighters spraying spectators with water and a Russian bear
skating pirouttes on ice.
   Perhaps the most poignant moment came early in the parade as
hundreds of Chinese students _ from Paris, Hong Kong and the United
States _ rode bicycles and flashed peace signs from the Arc de
Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde.
   They wore headbands bearing the Chinese characters signifying
``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.'' Some wore masks so they could not
be identified, a reflection of the fear that many Chinese feel after
the June 3-4 crackdown on the pro-democracy protesters.
   ``I came to see an unusual parade, and I got exactly what I
wanted,'' said Claude Bernes, an insurance salesman. ``It was
fabulous, but the only sketch that had any connection to the
revolution and its ideals was the Chinese.''
   The 250 musicians from Florida A&amp;M dazzled onlookers, estimated
at 1 million, as they boogied and tooted in an all-out salute to
soul singer James Brown.
   The band was flanked by two giant floats topped by dancing
pom-pom girls and flag-waving Americans.
   Some brandished messages to the folks back home _ ``Mom, please
pay my Visa bill,'' read one. ``Keep Abortion Legal,'' said another.
   More than 30 heads of state or government _ seven of them
attending the summit of the world's main industrialized democracies
_ were participating in bicentennial events.
   ``In the space of a few days, France has received on its
territory three-quarters of the world's gross national product and
nearly 100 percent of the planet's military arsenal,'' wrote the
conservative Le Figaro in today's editions.
   The much-anticipated parade, entitled ``The Marseillaise'' and
starring more than 10,000 musicians, turned the famed Champs-Elysees
into an enchanted stage for more than three hours.
   Scottish bagpipers marching in the rain shared the limelight with
British ponies painted to resemble zebras, a human pyramid formed by
undulating Senegalese dancers in native costume and Soviet tanks
spewing confetti-snow as they recreated the Siberian winter.
   The $15 million parade was billed as a ``a slightly frivolous
opera-ballet'' by its creator, advertising man Jean-Paul Goude,
better known for his work with Grace Jones and at Esquire magazine.
   Halfway through the program, the crowd drew its collective breath
as American diva Jessye Norman emerged from behind a curtain of rain
_ regally draped in a flowing tricolor gown _ to sing the rousing
verses of the Marseillaise.
   ``Many people were offended because our national anthem was sung
by a foreigner, but I think it's only fitting to have the best voice
in the world,'' said Bernard Houri, a computer engineer.
   Besides the lively and sometimes impatient crowd lining the
Champs-Elysees, perched on trees and in building windows, the parade
was broadcast to millions of viewers in France, Europe and the
United States.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, joined by about 30 heads of
state, watched from behind a bulletproof glass viewing booth
overlooking the Place de la Concorde, ringed with bleachers seating
16,000 invited guests.
   ``The most extraordinary image tonight was the ocean of people
who streamed down the Champs-Elysees,'' said Jean-Michel Jeanneney,
president of the Bicentennial Mission.
   For many, however, being there was not enough.
   ``It was a great show, but it should have been for everybody,''
said Terry Golden of London. ``We waited for hours and just barely
got a glimpse of the top of heads and floats. The parade was for the
rich, not for the masses, which really isn't in keeping with the
revolution, is it?''

   The Vatican is pleased that Indiana teen-ager
Paula Cooper was spared from the electric chair but regrets that
four Cuban military officers were executed, spokesman Joaquin
Navarro said today.
   Pope John Paul II had pleaded for clemency for Ms. Cooper, who
was sentenced to death for murdering an elderly Bible teacher when
she was 15, and for former Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa and three other former
Cuban officers convicted of drug trafficking.
   The Indiana Supreme Court Thursday commuted Ms. Cooper's sentence
to 60 years in prison. Also Thursday, Ochoa, a war hero who fought
with Fidel Castro in Cuba's revolution, and the three others were
executed by a firing squad.
   ``One is very happy to know that Paula Cooper received mercy,''
Navarro said in a statement released by the Vatican press office.
   ``On the other hand, one learned with regret the news of the
execution in Cuba of the four people for whom the Holy Father had
asked for a gesture of clemency for understandable humanitarian
reasons,'' he said.

   Typhoon Gordon, the strongest storm to
threaten the Philippines this year, gained strength today as it
roared toward Luzon, the country's main island, officials said.
   Storm warnings were raised over 10 provinces and at the six U.S.
military bases. The U.S. military's Far East Network described
Gordon as a ``super typhoon'' and said it would strike the northern
island of Luzon early Sunday.
   At 5 p.m., Gordon had peak winds of 128 mph and was heading
toward Luzon at 14 mph from a position 270 miles northeast of Manila.
   Earlier today, Gordon had top winds of 116 mph.
   Strong winds buffeted Manila late today, but there were no
reports of damage.
   At Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila, officials canceled
all inspections, training and other activities. The U.S.-run base's
emergency rescue and clean-up units were placed on alert and
non-essential personnel were ordered home.
   The Far East Network said some Military Airlift Command flights
to and from Clark would also be canceled because of the typhoon.
Heavy rains were expected in the Clark area late today, officials
said.
   There are 40,000 U.S. troops, civilian employees and military
dependents stationed at the six installations.
   Gordon is expected to cut across the northern tip of Luzon before
it moves out to the South China Sea later Sunday, weather
forecasters said.
   Residents of coastal areas were warned to take ``extreme
precaution'' against high waves and flash floods.
   The Philippine Coast Guard ordered all sea-going vessels on Luzon
not to leave port.
   Philippine Airlines said it canceled one domestic flight and
expected to ground more planes as the typhoon neared.

   A car bomb exploded near the center of
the capital today, killing at least nine people and injuring 49,
officials said.
   No one claimed responsibilty for the blast, but the government
blamed Moslem guerrillas and unidentified ``foreign agents'' who
support them.
   The guerrillas, based in neighboring Pakistan and supported
mainly by the United States and Saudi Arabia, have been fighting for
more than a decade to overthrow the Soviet-backed government.
   The bomb, hidden in a parked Toyota truck, exploded at noon on
Nader Shah Road near the city's center, shattering windows 300 yards
away and throwing bomb fragments 400 yards, police said.
   The blast left a crater six feet wide, six feet long and three
feet deep, officials said.
   Hospital sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at
least 10 of the injured were in critical condition.
   ``I saw people on the road. There were people with their heads
totally smashed,'' said Mohammad Nabi Andar, who arrived at the
scene five minutes after the blast.
   The explosion prompted stepped up security in the city of 2.25
million people. Police and soldiers were manning checkpoints around
the city, and all vehicles were stopped and searched.
   ``The explosion is the work of our opponents and foreign agents
who support them,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi
Amani. ``It was a very nasty thing to do just after Eid.'' Because
of the Eid al-Adha, the three-day Moslem feast of sacrifice, the
casualties were probably fewer.
   ``Had it been a normal day, at least 100 or 200 people may have
died,'' said police officer Mohammad Naim.

<HEAD>Argentina's Economy Minister Dies After Six Days in Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economy Minister Miguel Roig, who
was designing an austerity program to end hyperinflation and
Argentina's worst recession in its 173-year history, has died of a
heart attack. He was 68.
   Roig died Friday afternoon in his apartment, only six days after
taking office. The government news agency Telam said he left an
event at the French Embassy, became ill en route to the Treasury
Ministry and decided to go home.
   His body lay in state at Government House, and burial was set for
today.
   In his brief tenure as economy minister, Roig devalued the
currency by 54 percent and raised state-controlled utility prices by
a minimum 200 percent.
   Just before his death, Roig was trying to talk businessmen into
voluntary price controls to help President Carlos Menem's new
government slow inflation.
   Menem today named businessman Carlos Rapanelli to replace Roig, a
retired vice president of the grain-trading company Bunge and Born.
Rapanelli, 60, also a former executive with Bunge and Born, said he
would continue Roig's policies.
   Roig was not a member of the Peronist Party, which took over the
government on July 8, and his appointment added substance to Menem's
claims of forming a non-partisan government.
   Argentina is gripped by economic chaos. Inflation in June was
114.5 percent, and projections for July are 200 percent or more.
Unemployment stands at about 10 percent, and real wages have shrunk
an estimated 60 percent.
   Rapanelli is the the fifth economy minister since March 31, when
Juan Sourrouille resigned because he could not stabilize the economy.
   The Radical Civic Union lost national elections on May 14. While
President Raul Alfonsin remained in office, two other economy
ministers _ Juan Carlos Pugliese and then Jesus Rodriguez, both
national legislators _ attempted to implement economic reforms, and
failed.
   The Menem government already has announced its intention to sell
state-run companies, whose annual operating losses contribute
heavily to the fiscal deficit and inflation.

   Leaders of the world's seven richest nations today
pledged to ``sustain the momentum'' of moves toward democracy in
Poland and Hungary and jointly warned China that it risks
international isolation by continued repression.
   Despite the words of encouragement for Poland and Hungary, the
leaders' declaration showed no evidence of immediate aid to match
the the $125 million package of incentives President Bush extended
to the two Communist bloc nations earlier this week.
   Nor were there any joint sanctions against China.
   A declaration on political issues was issued at the midpoint of a
seven-nation summit of the United States, Britain, France, West
Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan.
   At the urging of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the document
was amended by the leaders to emphasize the ``urgent need for food''
assistance for Poland, where shortages are rampant.
   The document called for a meeting of ``all interested countries''
within the next few weeks to discuss ways to reward reforms in both
Poland and Hungary.
   Bush played down the absence of specific aid commitments,
although the seven leaders promised to consider and coordinate
economic assistance ``aimed at transforming and opening'' the
economies of the two Soviet bloc countries.
   Bush said, ``There have been some misconceptions (that) we would
come in here with a dollar package. I managed to convey in Poland
that that was not the case and here it is not the case.''
   He said the communique ``vindicated'' his approach.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking of the seven
summit nations, said, ``We are all very anxious to help. We are all
helping each in our own way.''
   The leaders reaffirmed their support for easing Poland's $39
billion foreign debt burden by relaxing its payment schedule. White
House chief of staff John Sununu said this could provide Poland with
$5 billion in relief.
   The communique also urged the International Monetary Fund to
speed up consideration of new loans for Poland.
   ``We welcome the process of reform under way in Poland and
Hungary,'' the statement said. ``We recognize that the political
changes taking place in these countries will be difficult to sustain
without economic progress.''
   Bush said, ``There seems to be a marvelous unanimity of opinion
of how to treat these East European countries.''
   Britain last month announced a $25 million aid package to Poland.
The money is to be spread over five years for a ``know-how'' fund on
training Poles to operate an entrepreneurial economy.
   Moving beyond political issues, the leaders met today to discuss
economic problems and economic issues in a windowless room atop the
Grand Arch, a 35-story avant-garde, cubic structure of glass and
marble that is France's newest national symbol _ and subject of
architectural controversy.
   On China, the political communique urged the World Bank to
withhold new loans and called on Beijing ``to cease action against
those who have done no more than claim their legitimate rights to
democracy and liberty.''
   The seven nations _ the United States, France, Britain, West
Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan _ all promised to shelter Chinese
students who did not want to go home.
   The leaders called on Chinese authorities ``to create conditions
which will avoid their isolation'' and to resume earlier moves
toward political and economic reforms in the world's largest nation.
   On the Soviet Union, the seven democracies registered their
approval of easing East-West tensions but said Moscow ``remains a
threat to each of us'' with its continuing military balance favoring
the East.
   The political statement also issued a fresh condemnation of
terrorism and vowed to bring terrorists to justice.
   ``We call on those holding hostages to release them immediately
and unconditionally and on those with influence over hostage-takers
to use it to this end,'' the document said. There are 15 foreign
hostages in Lebanon, including citizens of three summit countries,
the United States, Britain and Italy.
   The summit statement did not single out any country as a sponsor
of terrorism.
   The leaders underscored their support for international measures
to protect against aircraft hijackings and sabotage in the wake of
the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 that killed 270 people in
Lockerbie, Scotland, last December.
   ``We have agreed to give priority to preventing such attacks by
further strengthening security measures,'' the statement said. ``We
have also agreed on the need for improved methods of detecting
explosives.''
   The meeting of the world's wealthiest industrial democracies
largest seven came amid a huge celebration of the 200th birthday of
the French Revolution, a multimillion dollar gala that has been
criticized in the press here as overly extravagant and expensive.
   Bush today offered high praise for the festivities, saying the
pageant of parades, fireworks and parties was ``just magnificent,
beautifully done, very special to all Americans.''
   In the political declaration, the leaders said they were prepared
to support reforms in Poland and Hungary and to consider ``in an
appropriate fashion economic assistance aimed at transforming and
opening their economies in a durable manner.''
   The Big Seven countries said the aid should be designed ``to
sustain the momentum of the reforms through inward investment, joint
ventures, transfer of managerial skills, professional training and
other ventures which would help develop a more competitive economy.''
   After opening their talks Friday evening, the leaders joined in a
joyous celebration of Bastille Day, the beginning of the French
Revolution.
   The festivities began with a lavish dinner of lamb and sea perch.
The leaders then stepped onto a balcony enclosed with bulletproof
glass to watch a $15 million parade featuring, among other
attractions, the 250 musicians of the Florida A&amp;M band, gliding
backwards in a Michael Jackson moonwalk down the Champs Elysees
before a crowd estimated at 1 million.
   The evening concluded with a fireworks spectacular of red, white
and blue rocket plumes _ the French colors.
   While the leaders were smiling in public, there were sharp
differences in private sessions over French President Francois
Mitterrand's attempts to arrange a meeting of wealthy and poor
nations to discuss the problems of Third World countries.
   The United States and Britain firmly resisted Mitterrand's
proposal.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said the best approach to Third
World problems was on a case-by-case basis rather than convening an
international conference.
   ``You don't get solutions to problems by bunching up areas and
calling them North and South,'' as the rich and poor nations are
often called, Brady said.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl took a middle-road approach.
He said he had heard the complaints of poor nations and the demands
for the Big Seven summit countries to open their markets to Third
World products.
   There also was an argument in the wings between Britain and
France as the two sides, playing out old rivalries, sniped at each
other about everything from the significance of the French
Revolution to Mrs. Thatcher's right-wing politics.
   In addition to urging consideration of poor nations' demands,
Mitterrand emphasized the need to combat illegal drugs, saying he
was shocked by the effect the narcotics epidemic is having on
youths, according to French spokesman Hubert Vedrine.
   Kohl urged his summit partners to adopt policies that would allow
continued economic growth while reducing trade surpluses.
   Even before the summit opened, the United States and Japan moved
to cool trade tensions, which flared up this year after the
administration adopted a tough line targeting Japan as an unfair
trader because of barriers to the sale of American goods in Japan.
   Japan originally reacted with outrage at being singled out, but
both sides adopted a more conciliatory attitude Friday after a
private meeting between Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.
   The Japanese, reversing course, agreed to launch negotiations
aimed at removing barriers to sales of foreign goods.
   Bush was less successful, however, at breaking a deadlock between
negotiators trying to produce a debt-reduction plan for Mexico.
   U.S. officials announced later that the administration would be
willing to extend an emergency loan of between $1 billion and $2
billion to Mexico if the money would help break a deadlock in
current negotiations between Mexico and the commercial banks that
hold the bulk of its debt.

   Here is the official text of the political
declaration issued Saturday by the world's seven major
industrialized nations.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>EAST-WEST RELATIONS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   1. We, the leaders of our seven countries and the representatives
of the European Community, reaffirm the universal and supreme
importance which we attach to freedom, democracy and the promotion
of human rights.
   2. We see signs of this same desire for greater freedom and
democracy in the East. The people there, including the young people,
are reasserting these values and calling for a pluralist democratic
society. Some of their leaders are aware of the positive
contribution that greater freedom and democracy can make to the
modernization of their countries and are starting to make changes to
their laws, practices and institutions. Others are still endeavoring
to resist this movement by taking repressive measures which we
strongly condemn.
   3. We hope that freedom will be broadened and democracy
strengthened and that they will form the basis, after decades of
military confrontation, ideological antagonism and mistrust, for
increased dialogue and cooperation. We welcome the reforms under way
and the prospects of lessening the division of Europe.
   4. We call upon the Soviet government to translate its new
policies and pronouncements into further concrete action at home and
abroad. Military imbalances favoring the Soviet Union, both in
Europe and in Asia, remain an objective threat to each of us. Our
governments must therefore continue to be vigilant and maintain the
strength of our countries. For the foreseeable future, there is no
alternative for each of us, within existing alliances, to
maintaining a strategy of deterrence based upon an appropriate mix
of adequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces. In order
to hasten the advent of a world in which the weight of arms and
military strength is reduced, we recommit ourselves to the urgent
pursuit of a global ban on chemical weapons, a conventional forces
balance in Europe at the lowest possible level consistent with our
security requirements, and a substantial reduction in Soviet and
American strategic nuclear arms.
   5. We offer the countries of the East the opportunity to develop
balanced economic cooperation on a sound commercial basis consistent
with the security interests of each of our countries and with the
general principles of international trade. We have noted
developments of relations between the EEC and countries of the East,
in particular the conclusion of an agreement with Hungary, the
progress already achieved during the current discussions with Poland
and the opening of negotiations with the Soviet Union.
   6. We welcome the process of reform under way in Poland and
Hungary. We recognize that the political changes taking place in
these countries will be difficult to sustain without economic
progress. Each of us is prepared to support this process and to
consider, as appropriate and in a coordinated fashion, economic
assistance aimed at transforming and opening their economies in a
durable manner. We believe that each of us should direct our
assistance to these countries so as to sustain the momentum of
reform through inward investment, joint ventures, transfer of
managerial skills, professional training and other ventures which
would help develop a more competitive economy.
   Each of us is developing concrete initiatives designed to
encourage economic reforms to promote more competitive economies and
to provide new opportunities for trade.
   We agreed to work along with other interested countries and
multilateral institutions to concert support for the process of
reform under way in Hungary and Poland, in order to make our
measures of support more effective and mutually reinforcing. We will
encourage further creative efforts by interested governments, the
public and the private sectors in support of the reform process.
   Concerning concerted support for reform in Poland and Hungary, we
call for a meeting with all interested countries which will take
place in the next few weeks. We underline, for Poland, the urgent
need for food in present circumstances.
   To these ends, we ask the Commission of the European Communities
to take the necessary initiatives in agreement with the other member
states of the Community, and to associate, besides the summit
participants, all interested countries.
   7. We are in favor of an early conclusion of the negotiations
between the IMF and Poland. The strengthened debt strategy is
applicable to Poland, provided it meets the conditions. We are ready
to support in the Paris Club the rescheduling of Polish debt
expeditiously and in a flexible and forthcoming manner.
   8. We see good opportunities for the countries of West and East
to work together to find just solutions to conflicts around the
world, to fight against under-development, to safeguard the
resources and the environment and to build a freer and more open
world.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CHINA:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   We have already condemned the violent repression in China in
defiance of human rights. We urge the Chinese authorities to cease
action against those who have done no more than claim their
legitimate rights to democracy and liberty.
   The repression has led each of us to take appropriate measures to
express our deep sense of condemnation, to suspend bilateral
Ministerial and high-level contacts, and also to suspend arms trade
with China, where it exists. Furthermore each of us has agreed that,
in view of current economic uncertainties, the examination of new
loans by the World Bank be postponed. We also have decided to extend
the stays of those Chinese students who so desire.

   We look to the Chinese authorities to create conditions which
will avoid their isolation and provide for a return to cooperation
based upon the resumption of movement toward political and economic
reform, and openness.
   We understand and share the grave concern felt by the people of
Hong Kong following these events. We call on the government of the
People's Republic of China to do what is necessary to restore
confidence in Hong Kong. We recognize that the continuing support of
the international community will be an important element in the
maintenance of confidence in Hong Kong.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TERRORISM:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   1. We remain resolutely opposed to terrorism in all its forms. We
confirm the commitment each of us has undertaken to the principle of
making no concessions to terrorists or their sponsors and to
cooperating, bilaterally and in all relevant international fora, in
combatting terrorism. We reiterate our commitment to the policies
agreed at previous summits; in particular we condemn state-sponsored
terrorism. We are determined not to let terrorists remain
unpunished, and to have them brought to justice within the framework
of international law and in conformity with the rule of law. We call
upon those states which have supported or encouraged terrorist acts
to demonstrate by their actions that they have renounced such
policies. We reaffirm in particular our absolute condemnation of the
taking of hostages. We call on those holding hostages to release
them immediately and unconditionally on those with influence over
hostage-takers to use it to this end.
   2. Deeply concerned for the safety of all travelers and outraged
by the murderous attacks perpetrated against international civil
aviation and the frequent threat to air transport safety from
terrorists groups, we reaffirm our commitment to the fight against
all forms of terrorism affecting civil aviation. We reiterate our
determination to contribute to reinforcing internationally agreed
measures for protection against aircraft hijackings and sabotage.
   3. We particularly condemn the recent attack on an aircraft over
Scotland, which killed 270 people. We have agreed to give priority
to preventing such attacks by further strengthening security
measures. We attach importance to the implementation of the work
plan recently adopted by the ICAO Council for this purpose.
   4. We have also agreed on the need for improved methods of
detecting explosives. We endorse efforts currently under way in ICAO
to develop, as a matter of high priority, an appropriate
international regime for the marking of plastic and sheet explosives
for detection.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>HUMAN RIGHTS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In 1789, the rights of man and of the citizen were solemnly
proclaimed. Just over 40 years ago, the General Assembly of the
United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which have been further developed and codified and are now embodiesd
in the Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights.
   We reaffirm our commitment to freedom, democratic principles and
human rights. We reaffirm our belief in the rule of law which
respects and protects without fear or favor the rights and liberties
of every citizen, and provides the setting in which the human spirit
can develop in freedom and diversity.
   Human rights are a matter of legitimate international concern. We
commit ourselves again to encouraging and promoting the universal
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
   Looking toward the future, we see opportunities as well as
threats; this impels us to pledge our firm commitment to uphold
international standards of human rights and to confirm our
willingness to reaffirm them and to develop them further.
   We stress the protection of freedom of thought, conscience and
religion, and of freedom of opinion and expression; for without
these freedoms, other rights cannot be fully realized.
   We stress also respect for the rule of law and the plurality of
opinion, for without them there can be neither representative
government nor democracy.
   We believe equally in freedom of association in a pluralist
society.
   We hold that the right of each individual to physical integrity
and dignity must be guaranteed. We abhor and condemn torture in all
its forms.
   We believe that all human beings must act toward each other in a
spirit of fraternity.
   We believe that everyone has a right to equality of opportunity
as well as to own property, alone or in association with others.
Extreme poverty and exclusion from society violate the dignity of
everyone enduring them. Those who suffer or are in need should be
supported.
   We stress that the rights of the child, the disabled and the
elderly require special protection.
   We consider that developments in the human sciences, for instance
the progress achieved in genetics and organ transplantation, must be
applied in accordance with all human rights if the dignity of human
beings is to be preserved.
   We, the present generation, have an obligation to ensure that
future generations will inherit a healthy environment.
   We reaffirm our belief that these rights and freedoms cannot be
properly safeguarded without the rule of law, impartial justice and
genuine democratic institutions.

   The Bush administration today raised the possibility
of a breakthrough within the next 24 hours or so in the drawn-out
debt negotiations between Mexico and its private bankers.
   ``It is in the dotting the `i' and crossing the `t' stage on some
of the tough details that are important both of Mexico and the
banks,'' White House chief of staff John Sununu told reporters at
the economic summit of the seven major industrialized nations.
   The White House would like to have a deal to show to its partners
at the summit.
   The negotiations have become a test case of the administration's
new strategy for dealing with the $1.3 trillion debt of the
developing nations. The new approach, representing a major shift in
American policy, emphasizes debt reduction or forgiveness.
   Sununu, showing his thumb and index finger nearly touching, said
Mexican officials and private bankers ``are now about that far
apart.'' He said there was expected to be another bargaining session
``in the next 24 hours or so. And it is hoped that at that meeting
substantially most of, if not all, of that gap will be closed.''
   Meanwhile, President Bush and the leaders of Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy and Japan opened their first full day of
talks today with an agreement to postpone new World Bank loans to
China.
   The leaders noted in a statement that they already had condemned
``the violent repression. ... We urge the Chinese authorities to
cease action against those who have done no more than claim their
legitimate rights to democracy and liberty.''
   During the morning session, the leaders and their finance
ministers discussed the worrisome rise in inflation rates.
   ``They all recognize that inflation is a danger, even though some
are more seriously affected at the moment,'' said a Canadian
official, demanding anonymity.
   ``Inflation has to be considered as a matter of very high
priority,'' he added.
   A spokesman for the European Economic Community, who demanded
anonymity, said senior officials of some private banks met here
Friday afternoon with some of the indebted nations, including Mexico
and the Philippines.
   ``They are very close to an agreement with Mexico but not before
the end of the summit,'' he said. The 12-nation trading bloc, also
known as the Common Market, also attends the gathering.
   The EEC spokesman said, ``The problem was that until about 10
days ago the banks were sending extremely junior officials to
negotiate with very senior officials, sometimes ministers of
finance, from the indebted countries.''
   Sununu, asked about the elevation of the discussions, said, ``It
is amazing what can happen when you get the folks who can make the
decisions involved in the process.''
   On Friday, French President Francois Mitterrand pressed the
demand of poorer nations for a special conference of the rich and
poor countries to discuss the plight of the Third World.
   But the United States and Britain resisted that approach.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady insisted that handling Third
World problems on a case-by-case basis, the approach the richer
nations currently take, is better than an international conference.
   Brady unveiled the new American debt approach last spring.
Several other nations have approved the move, but some U.S. allies
also expressed reservations about what they viewed as government
bailouts.
   Nigel Lawson, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said, ``What
is important is we have agreed (on) this extension of the debt
strategy,'' referring to the American plan.
   ``And the commercial banks need to be absolutely clear there is
no new initiative coming forward,'' he said. ``That is the position,
and it is up to them to negotiate a debt reduction agreement with
the debtor countries, starting with Mexico.''
   Brady said the United States was willing to work with the other
industrialized nations to arrange a $1 billion to $2 billion
emergency loan to help Mexico meet its obligations while it
negotiates with private bankers for a new debt accord.
   Mexico, with a loan portfolio of $100 billion, is the developing
world's second largest debtor after Brazil.
   Mitterrand signaled his support for urgent assistance for Mexico.
   That country, he told French television, ``is on the edge of an
explosion because of the weight of its debt and the impossibility of
carrying the burden.''
   ``No one,'' he said, ``has an interest in this explosion taking
place, which would mean more misery for a suffering people.''
   Mexico owes private lenders $54 billion, with about $15 billion
due American banks.
   In its negotiations with bankers, Mexico wants to slash both its
overall debt and the amount of its annual interest payments, which
run about $10 billion a year.
   The United States and Japan also took steps as the summit opened
to lower trade tensions between the two countries.
   The Japanese agreed to a U.S. proposal to launch negotiations
aimed at removing barriers to the sale of foreign goods. The talks
will focus on so-called structural rigidities, broad-based barriers
such as the Japanese distribution system.
   The Japanese, who had originally balked at the idea of such
talks, agreed to a one-year deadline to come up with results.

   A leftist group has claimed
responsibility for the bombing that injured seven U.S. Army soldiers.
   ``Yankee soldiers are only safe in their own land because here
they are the target of our bullets and explosives,'' the Morazanista
Liberation Front said in a communique issued Friday.
   The front, thought to be an arm of the outlawed Communist Party
founded in 1979, has claimed responsibility for at least five other
attacks, including three this year. Twenty-two U.S. soldiers were
injured in those incidents.
   ``The Morazanista sword is raised to expel or eliminate gringo
invaders,'' said the communique, which was delivered to the
newspaper La Prensa in San Pedro Sula, 125 miles north of the
capital.
   Police said a homemade bomb was thrown Thursday night at a group
of nine U.S. Army military policemen in civilian clothes as they
passed by the Lido Discotheque in La Ceiba, a coastal town 200 miles
north of Tegucigalpa.
   The four most seriously injured were flown to a U.S. military
hospital in San Antonio, Texas, U.S. officials said. Three others
were being treated at Enrique Soto Cano air base near Tegucigalpa.
Two escaped injury.
   All nine soldiers were from 459th Military Police Company, based
at Fort Davis in Panama. They had come to Honduras on temporary duty
to take part in a series of U.S.-Honduran joint military exercises.
   The nine military policemen were on security-escort duty with a
North Dakota National Guard convoy that was returning from drills in
northern Honduras to the base at Soto Cano when it stopped near La
Ceiba for the night.
   Charles V. Barclay, U.S. Embassy spokesman, said Thursday the
nine military policemen went into town without leave.
   The front ``called on the North American people to exert pressure
on your Senate and Congress, pressure so that your young sons will
not die in foreign lands defending imperial causes.
   ``Our actions will continue claiming Yankee casualties in the
pursuit of the war of liberation we are waging against the
invader,'' the communique said. ``The national dignity cannot be
trampled with impunity.''
   The United States maintains a permanent force of at least 1,200
troops in Honduras but thousands more rotate through every year on
training missions.

<HEAD>Police Forced to Crawl For Hours Chasing Suspect In Ceiling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VERONA, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police officer crawled through the false
ceiling of a closed nightclub for more than five hours trying to
capture a burglary suspect who led him on a dark, dirty chase.
   ``It got to the point where it started to be funny, even though I
didn't know if the guy had a gun,'' Patrolman William Maggio said
after Friday morning's marathon.
   The incident began at about 4 a.m. when police responded to an
alarm at Cunimondo's Keyboard jazz club.
   Before officers entered the club, William Robert Vertullo, 27, of
Pittsburgh climbed up into the space between the building's
suspended ceiling and the building's original ceiling, police said.
A second man apparently escaped, police said.
   Maggio crawled up into the ceiling after the man, and spent the
next few hours trying to find him and catch him as other officer
stood by.
   ``He was lying around most of the time and I was the one doing
most of the crawling,'' Maggio said. ``I'd crawl and he would double
back on me. He was smart.''
   At one point, Maggio said, he tried to talk the guy into
surrendering. ``He said `OK' and ducked behind some ductwork and
disappeared.''
   After hours of crawling through wires, nooks and crannies, Maggio
and other officers finally used a rope to pull the man out of his
final hiding place, a gap between the outside and interior walls of
the club.
   After being taken to the police station, Vertullo fell to the
floor of his cell. He was taken to St. Margaret's Hospital, where he
tried to escape, Maggio said.
   Vertullo was charged with burglary, possessing instruments of
crime, criminal mischief, attempted escape, resisting arrest and
conspiracy. He was being held on $100,000 bond.

   Outside the closed meeting rooms of the House
Appropriations Committee last week, the view was the same: clusters
of men and women leaning against walls, talking, reading newspapers,
killing time.
   It was a vigil of lobbyists, waiting for members of the
Appropriations subcommittees to strike their deals and map in
private how the government would spend more than half of the $1.17
trillion federal budget for the 1990 fiscal year.
   For many of the lobbyists, the wait was grim. After years of
federal budget constraints, advocates for programs that could once
count on generous government treatment are finding Uncle Sam
stingier than he used to be. And they're competing with each other
for the same scarce federal dollars.
   ``The first clue is that attendance here is 10 percent of what it
usually is,'' said David Bradley, motioning down the Rayburn House
Office Building corridor, as he and other lobbyists waited outside a
meeting of the Appropriations labor, health and human services
subcommittee. ``That's because there's no money.''
   Bradley, lobbying for low-income programs, was exaggerating, but
only slightly.
   The labor subcommittee has jurisdiction over the government's
health, welfare and education programs, a $155 billion slice of the
federal pie for the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
   But law requires that about two-thirds of that be spent on
specific programs. The rest of it is up for grabs, and small
programs with limited appeal to lawmakers are finding themselves
competing for funds with politically popular initiatives for
education, AIDS research, the homeless and the like.
   This strikes fear in the hearts of lobbyists for the government's
less visible programs.
   ``Poverty isn't popular,'' said Bradley. ``What we're seeing is
an understated but very definite realignment of government
priorities. We're seeing interest flow in three or four areas, and
an ending of the government role in other areas.''
   Outside another closed door, this one in the Capitol basement,
another group of lobbyists waited as the Appropriations treasury and
postal service subcommittee wrote its $18.5 billion bill.
   Some of them were working on behalf of postal subsidies for small
newspapers, charities, unions and schools, which are entitled to
lower mailing rates. The Reagan administration had tried to
terminate the $430 million program, and President Bush has proposed
limiting it.
   Advocates were hoping to win a slight increase for the subsidies,
but they acknowledged they faced formidable competition for federal
funds from another area within the subcommittee's jurisdiction.
   ``The big issue in this committee is drug enforcement,'' said
Carolyn Emigh, counsel for the Non-Profit Mailers Association.
   Anti-drug programs are among the most popular programs on Capitol
Hill these days, as lawmakers heed polls indicating that drugs are
the foremost problem on the minds of voters. Their appeal makes it
easy for members of Congress to lavish them with money.
   ``Right now drugs are pretty high on the list,'' Sen. Robert
Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee,
acknowledged in an interview.
   Congressional spending priorities are easy to discern by studying
the way the Senate Appropriations Committee divided up the $658
billion it oversees among its 13 subcommittees.
   The three largest increases over 1989 spending levels were of
$5.3 billion to the subcommittee that oversees veterans, housing,
science and space programs; $4 billion to the panel that controls
health and education; and $1.8 billion to the subcommittee with
jurisdiction over law enforcement.
   That still left Byrd fielding complaints at a committee meeting
last week that several subcommittees had been granted too little
money.
   The tight money seems not to have stopped lawmakers themselves
from seeking funds for projects within their home districts, however.
   Byrd said the Appropriations interior subcommittee, which he also
chairs, has so far received 1,971 requests for money for projects.
And Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, chairman of the Appropriations labor,
health and human services panel, said he had gotten 455 requests.

   A former Vietnamese refugee survived 21
days at sea in an 18-foot-long fishing dinghy before being washed
ashore on an island in the Timor Sea, Australian Associated Press
reported Saturday.
   Thep Van Tran of Darwin was on a fishing trip when his motor
failed and he drifted from the Perron Islands, southwest of Darwin,
to the remote Timorese island of Soe, the news agency said.
   Tran, 37, was found Tuesday near the village of Kolbane, about
450 miles northwest of Darwin, AAP reported.
   Tran has been detained by officials on Soe, but no reason has
been given, AAP said.
   It said he had left Vietnam 10 years ago.

   Divers have recovered treasures buried
underwater for more than 2,000 years in the wreck of a Roman ship,
newspapers reported Saturday.
   The expedition, which started nearly two weeks ago, has uncovered
a late 2nd century B.C. bronze Grecian oil-lamp in the shape of a
deer's head, a fragment of a small wooden statue, and various other
items hidden in the seabed around the ship, the reports said.
   The 65-foot-long ship, which sank in the Gulf of Baratti 12 miles
from the island of Elba, was discovered in 1974, and some of its
valuable objects were recovered by private treasure hunters.
   The government organized an expedition to bring up the remaining
items of archaelogical interest this summer.

   Six people have died in central
Yugoslavia over the past two months from a viral disease that has
hospitalized 126 others, the Tanjug news agency reported Saturday.
   Last month, four people were reported to have died from the
disease, which is spread by field mice and other rodents and their
parasites.
   Doctors have advised people to wash fruit and produce carefully
and be careful when they are outside.
   Epidemiologists say there is no efficient drug or vaccine to stop
the disease, locally dubbed ``mouse fever.'' Symptoms include high
fever, back and abdominal pains and redness of the face and eyes.
   News reports said the cases appeared in May in the republic of
Bosnia-Hercegovina.

<HEAD>Debt Reduction Vital To Economic Recovery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mexico badly needs the help President Bush is
offering to reduce payments on its foreign debt, but even with
substantial relief, coaxing the country out of seven years of
stagnation may be a slow process.
   ``Mexican as well as foreign investors are waiting for the
starting flag that the solution to the debt negotiations will
give,'' said President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who met with Bush
last week.
   Attention was focused last week on talks between Mexico and
creditor banks as world leaders gathered in Paris for an economic
summit. Bush wanted an agreement as a showpiece for its strategy to
reduce the Third World's $1.3 trillion debt.
   The lengthy negotiations apparently snagged, and Bush tried to
give them a boost by offering Mexico a temporary loan of $1 billion
to $2 billion. The offer appeared to be aimed at showing banks and
other creditor nations the United States would put its money where
its mouth is.
   For Mexico, an agreement would mean both money and a
psychological boost, two elements needed to reignite growth. Mexico
owes $107.4 billion and maintains that its economy is hobbled
because it must spend $16 billion every year to pay the interest and
principal.
   Mexico wants to reduce those payments by $7 billion, money that
could then be invested in industrial expansion to provide jobs.
Mexico has one million young people entering the job market every
year, creating tremendous social pressure _ some of which is
relieved by emigration to the United States.
   What can happen when a social system is under stress was seen
earlier this year when rioting broke out in Caracas, Venezuela, and
food stores were looted in Argentina.
   One private economist compared Mexico to a family whose loan
payments leave little left over even for basics like rent, food or
transportation. The family cuts spending and tries to increase its
income to avoid taking on more loans, but all its money goes into
the loan payments and it remains poor.
   Mexico incurred most of its debt between 1976 and 1982, when
eager banks pressed money on a nation that thought oil had made it
rich. But the price of oil crashed and growth in Mexico for the past
six years has averaged about zero. The buying power of the average
paycheck has been cut in half.
   ``When we talk about growth, it means to stop the fall in buying
power, to stop the process of impoverishment of Mexican society,''
said Jacobo Zaidenweber, a textile manufacturer who is president of
the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce.
   To turn the situation around requires investment. That's where
foreign debt reduction comes in.
   ``If a satisfactory agreement with respect to the debt is
reached, the necessary conditions to resume growth will be there,''
said Nora Lustig, an economics professor at the Colegio de Mexico
and a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   The agreement being discussed by the banks and Mexico calls for
approximately 35 percent of Mexico's debt to be written off and for
other adjustments in the debt structure to reduce the load.
   Some banks are reportedly asking for a clause that would increase
payments once Mexico's economy improves, but upping payments might
also cut off a recovery.
   Part of what Mexico gains will go to buying back debt at a
discount, economists say. The rest can be used for investment in
infrastructure that could prime the pump for the private sector.
   With fewer payments to make, the government will need to borrow
less money. That will put less pressure on domestic credit markets
and make more money available for the private sector at lower rates.
   Increased confidence would attract foreign investment and,
perhaps even more important, help bring back billions invested
abroad by wealthy Mexicans. Capital flight, according to recent
reports, has already ceased.
   Zaidenweber said a debt agreement will help him expand his
textile plants to compete with imports and increase exports.
   ``We have to grow to lower costs and get more modern equipment to
increase quality,'' he said.
   The government has set the stage for recovery with a program that
has pushed free-market reforms. Salinas has been a driving force
there, first as budget director, now as president.
   Nevertheless, Bank of Mexico director Miguel Mancera was cautious.
   ``The resources of the country are scarce. It's evident there
isn't enough for everything we would like to do,'' the daily El
Financiero quoted him as saying.
   ``Recovery will most likely be slow in the beginning,'' Ms.
Lustig said, ``but we might get a surprise.''

<HEAD>Indian Bones to be Reburied at Wounded Knee After Symposium</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The remains of ancient Seminole Indians
dug up in Florida will be reburied at Wounded Knee next month in a
ceremony to be conducted by members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe.
   The ceremony is scheduled for Aug. 11, at the Wounded Knee
Cemetery where about 200 Indians killed by U.S. troops in 1890 are
buried.
   The reburial of the prehistoric remains will follow a symposium
on archaeological ethics and the treatment of the dead to be held at
the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, said Larry Zimmerman,
a USD professor.
   Included in the 1,200 pounds of remains are pieces of pottery and
the dirt that was unearthed along with the bone fragments.
   ``The Florida earth will be with them,'' Zimmerman said.
   The remains, originally dug up by researchers and later given to
the Seminoles, were sent to the university by tribal members four
years ago under the condition that they not be used for scienctific
study, he said. Recently, Seminole tribe members asked USD officials
to give the remains to members of the Oglala Tribe for burial.
   The Oglalas make up the majority of the population on the Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation where Wounded Knee is located. But remains
from other distant Indian tribes have in recent years been sent to
Wounded Knee for burial.
   The issue of reburial has become a heated topic in archaeological
circles over the last decade. It's a subject that is often boiled
down to a case of science vs. religion, Zimmerman said.
   ``The whole issue of reburial is an issue that started primarily
in Australia and among native American Indians,'' he said. ``What's
happened over the last decade and a half is (indigenous peoples)
have become more politically active on this issue and see it as a
two-pronged concern.
   ``Is it a violation of religious freedom ... and who gets to use
these remains and where do they put them?''
   ``It isn't science vs. religion, it is who controls the past,''
he said.
   Archaelogists from about 20 countries and representatives from
North American Indian tribes and other indigenous people from around
the world are expected to attend the meeting.

   The Senate Armed Services committee is backing
plans to build the expensive B-2 stealth bomber, but its support
hinges on whether the plane performs as advertised.
   ``If that plane doesn't fly, the debate's over,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, telling reporters of the
committee decision to impose a series of requirements before full
production of the $500-million-a-copy jet.
   ``This is really putting some teeth in `fly before you buy,'''
said Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the senior Republican on the committee.
   The military wants to buy 132 of the aircraft. The stealth bomber
is designed to evade Soviet radar but has yet to fly. If successful,
the jet could force the Soviets to totally revamp their air defense
system at a cost far exceeding the price tag on the B-2, Nunn said.
   The bomber's maiden flight had been planned for today in
Palmdale, Calif., but it was delayed for at least two or three days
because of a low fuel pressure reading on one of the plane's gauges,
the Air Force said.
   In its $305 billion defense bill, approved Friday, the committee
backed Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on a broad swath of issues. It
supported his decision to end production of several weapons
including the F-14D fighter jet.
   But the House Armed Services Committee last month overruled both
Cheney and its own chairman and voted to authorize production of the
newest version of that fighter.
   The Senate panel parted ways with Cheney when it voted to finish
research and development of the controversial V-22 ``Osprey''
tilt-rotor aircraft. It invited Cheney to change his mind on
canceling that program.
   The Marine Corps is backing the program to produce the Osprey,
which takes off like a helicopter and then flies like an airplane,
but Cheney decided to cancel it.
   The committee approved Cheney's request to end several other
weapons programs, including production of the F15-E fighter after
fiscal 1991, the Apache helicopter after fiscal 1991, the Army
Helicopter Improvement Program, the Phoenix missile, the M88
tank-recovery tow vehicle, and an SSN-688 nuclear submarine.
   Nunn said he expected a fight in the full Senate on the
committee's decision to increase spending on the Strategic Defense
Initiative by $800 million next year, to $4.5 billion. That's $366
million below the administration request.
   The committee also:
   _Endorsed a 3.6 percent military pay raise, along with increases
in flight pay and medical benefits.
   _Earmarked additional spending for cleaning up waste at
Department of Energy military nuclear facilities to $1.8 billion,
$418 million above the administration request. Additional money
would also be provided for research on new cleanup techniques.
   _Included $100 million for research on the proposed aerospace
plane, first proposed by former President Ronald Reagan, which would
take off and land like a regular jet but flies at great speeds in
the upper atmosphere.
   _Direct the Defense Department to reduce emissions of
ozone-depleting chemicals into the atmosphere.
   The committee also provided $30 million for developing lighter
and more lethal weapons for infantry soldiers. Nunn said sometimes
the infantry soldiers are given short shrift compared to the more
complex weapons programs.

<TEXT>
   The century-old legend of an admitted cannibal has
become grist for local jokes and promotions, but a legal expert
hopes the tools of modern forensic science will lay to rest
questions about the case.
   Alferd G. Packer admitted eating the flesh of some of his five
fellow gold prospectors in 1874, but claimed he did so to avert
starvation after the men died while marooned in the San Juan
Mountains. He was eventually convicted of manslaughter after two
trials nearly a decade later.
   On Monday, a group of anthropologists, archaeologists and
pathologists will attempt to exhume the remains of the five victims
near the mountain town of Lake City, about 170 miles southwest of
Denver.
   The expedition is the brainchild of James E. Starrs, a professor
of law and forensic sciences at George Washington University's Law
Center in Washington.
   Starrs has used the Packer case as an example in his classes
because of the nature of the evidence presented at his two murder
trials. He believes scientific examination of the 115-year-old
remains will determine whether Packer really killed the gold diggers
and then ate them.
   Packer's admitted cannibalism has made him a bizarre folk-hero _
especially at the University of Colorado Alferd Packer Grill, where
annual eating contests mark the end of the school year.
   The legend arose out of the Colorado Rockies in the winter of
1874.
   Packer, a 42-year-old harness maker plagued with epilepsy,
convinced a group of prospectors in Utah he could lead them to the
Colorado gold fields. Five men stayed with him until they became
marooned in the San Juan Mountains.
   On April 16, 1874, a rosy-cheeked Packer walked into the Los
Pinos Indian Agency, at what is now the town of Sagauche.
Authorities became suspicious when they found he was carrying
several neatly wrapped packages of human flesh.
   Packer admitted shooting one man, Shannon Wilson Bell, in self
defense, but said Bell killed the other four with a hatchet while he
was looking for a route out of the mountains. He claimed starvation
drove him to eat the flesh of the dead prospectors.
   Several months later, Packer fled just before artist John A.
Randolph, on assignment for Harper's Weekly, discovered and sketched
the five bodies.
   Packer was arrested in 1883 in Cheyenne, Wyo., and was taken to
the then-new mining camp of Lake City where he was convicted of
murdering one of the prospectors, Israel Swan.
   The state Supreme Court overturned that sentence. Packer then was
retried for all five murders and convicted of manslaughter at
Gunnison. In addition to Bell and Swan, the victims included George
Noon, James Humphrey and Frank Miller.
   In 1886, Packer was sentenced to 40 years. He was paroled in 1901
and died April 24, 1907.
   Last summer, Starrs visited Lake City and says he located the
burial site of the five men near a bronze and stone memorial to the
victims set amid wildlfowers and clover a mile outside of town.
   ``Until we see a bone ... we can't be 100 percent certain, but
the place has been maintained as a grave site since the early part
of this century,'' said Patrick Zickler, editor of Starrs'
Scientific Sleuthing Review.
   Starrs says the bones should be in good enough condition to
determine how the men died.
   ``From the bones we will be able to see bullet holes and
hatchmarks where the skinning knife might have scraped the bones.
We'll be able to tell if the victims were cannibalized, if they were
struck by a hatchet blow, if they were really near starvation,''
Starrs said.
   ``My personal feelings are we'll find more bullet wounds than
described,'' Zickler said. ``My pet theory is that Bell and Packer
conspired against the others because of the general desperation of
the situation. For some reason we'll never know, Packer and Bell had
a falling out. Packer emerged victorious _ and Bell became a perfect
scapegoat for all the other deaths.''
   Many of the 219 permanent residents of Lake City hope the dig
will raise the town's profile as a vacation spot.
   At the General Store, proprietor Jack Eisele is selling buttons
that read: ``Alferd Packer Ate Here-Lake City, Co.''
   T-shirts for sale in several shops proclaim, ``Have a Friend for
Dinner,'' and ``Alferd Packer, Serving His Fellow Man.''
   The menu at Murphy's Restaurant includes Packer's Platter, ``for
those with a man-eating appetite.''
   A theater group from Western State College in Gunnison on Monday
will open a three-week nightly dramatization of Packer's trial in
the Lake City Courthouse, where the original trial took place.

   The first flight of the B-2 stealth bomber
was delayed for at least two or three days because of a low
fuel-pressure reading on one of the advanced bomber's gauges, the
Air Force said today.
   The problem occurred as a small aircraft strayed into the
airspace surrounding the site and made a surprise landing. The
Cessna 182 played no role in the decision to scrub the flight, said
Air Force Col. Douglas Kennett.
   ``We decided to postpone for safety reasons alone,'' Kennett
said. ``There was no other reason. We err on the side of safety.''
   The pilot of the Cessna was being interviewed by Los Angeles
County sheriff's investigators, Kennett said. The pilot, who was
apparently lost, was questioned but was not under arrest. His
single-engine plane also carried two children.
   The two-man B-2 crew had taxied to the end of the runway and was
in preparation for takeoff when the crew members observed that fuel
pressure gauge readings for takeoff were too low.
   Despite the great anticipation and expectation of a maiden voyage
for the B-2 today, the Air Force was not disappointed by the delay,
Kennett said.
   ``We are still ready,'' he said. ``We will be up when it is time.
We are still looking forward to the first flight.''
   Air Force officials had feverishly prepared the radar-evading,
$500 million B-2 for its maiden flight, after a key Capitol Hill
committee ruled against funding the bat-winged aircraft until it
leaves the ground.
   At 6:35 a.m., nearly an hour after sunrise, the B-2 emerged from
its hangar and began its slow roll down the runway in anticipation
of the first flight.
   The plane was arrayed with radar enhancers, reflective material
installed at eight points on the leading edge of its wing and seven
points on the trailing edge. The enhancers were needed to allow test
personnel to keep track of the radar-evading aircraft during its
maiden flight.
   Aviation buffs who hoped to catch a glimpse of the bomber's first
flight began gathering outside the perimeter of Air Force Plant 42
early today, Air Force spokesman Maj. Pat Mullaney said. Several
dozen were already in place at 2 a.m., Mullaney said.
   The $500 million stealth bomber prototype concluded high-speed
runway tests on Thursday with the menacing craft lifting its nose
wheel briefly in the last step toward flight.
   Plans had been for the radar-evading bomber take off from Air
Force Plant 42 here and then land two hours later at nearby Edwards
Air Force Base.
   While the B-2 was being prepared for flight, congressional
opposition over its cost threatened to ground the craft.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, in approving President
Bush's $305.5 billion defense-spending request for fiscal 1990,
stipulated Friday that no new money be spent on the bomber until it
flies.
   ``If that plane doesn't fly, the debate is over,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., the panel's chairman. ``It is far too expensive to be a
stealth taxi.''
   Last week, the Pentagon announced the first flight tests of the
bomber _ 18 months behind schedule _ would be held during the next
two weeks.
   The Pentagon is proposing a $4.7 billion budget in fiscal 1990
for the B-2. Manufactured by Northrop Corp., in Palmdale, the plane
will cost about $24 billion over a three-year peak period beginning
in fiscal 1992, according to Defense Department figures.
   The department has invested about $22.4 billion in the plane so
far.
   The Pentagon hopes to purchase 132 of the bombers.

<HEAD>Last Surviving Top War Criminal Dies In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teiichi Suzuki, a former army general who helped
plan Japan's economy during World War II and later was imprisoned as
a war criminal, died of heart failure Saturday, his family said. He
was 100.
   Family members said Suzuki died at a hospital in Chiba near Tokyo.
   Suzuki, who served as a lieutenant general in the Imperial Army,
was the last surviving member of a group of top leaders convicted of
war crimes.
   He was the primary planner of Japan's wartime economy, serving as
state minister of the Planning Board from 1941 to 1943.
   Following Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945, Suzuki stood
trial along with wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and other
Japanese leaders.
   Suzuki was given a life sentence by the International Military
Tribunal for the Far East in 1948, but he was released on parole
from Sugamo Prison for war criminals in Tokyo in 1955 and given a
full pardon in 1958.
   The trial of 28 wartime Japanese leaders, charged with conspiracy
to wage war and negligence in preventing war crimes, began May 3,
1946, lasted 417 days, and cost $10 million.
   Seven of the 28 were condemned and hanged Dec. 23, 1948,
including Tojo, who bungled a suicide attempt when he was about to
be arrested. The others were Gens. Seishiro Itagaki, Kenji Doihara,
Heitaro Kimura, Iwane Matsui and Akira Muto; and Koki Hirota, the
only civilian.
   Among the remaining 21 defendants, one was declared insane, and
Yosuke Matsuoka, a U.S.-educated former foreign minister, and Adm.
Osami Nagano died of illness while the trials were in progress.
   Five died while serving prison terms, and the others, including
Suzuki, were paroled after serving part of their sentences. These
men included Mamoru Shigemitsu, who later served as foreign minister
in 1954.
   All but Suzuki had died earlier of old age or illness.
   The Japanese war criminals were sentenced Nov. 12, 1948, and
returned to Sugamo Prison where they had been held since their
arrests shortly after the allied occupation of Japan began in
September 1945.
   Suzuki, after briefly returning to government service following
his pardon, dropped from public view and refused to meet reporters.

   A 45-minute chat between Nelson
Mandela and President P.W. Botha has thrown government and
anti-apartheid forces off balance as they try to adjust their
policies to the unprecedented event.
   The meeting July 5 between the imprisoned African National
Congress leader and the retiring president caused confusion on all
sides.
   The exiled ANC described the meeting as a publicity stunt, but as
praise poured in from other anti-apartheid groups, it withheld
further comment.
   It may be that the 73-year-old Botha, facing forced retirement at
the hands of the National Party he controlled for 10 years, gave
history a push just to spite his designated successor.
   The heir apparent, F.W. de Klerk, has not commented on the
meeting in Cape Town, and the government seems to be scrambling to
explain it without losing too many votes to the white right-wing in
September parliamentary elections.
   Apparently preparing the groundwork for Mandela's release, the
government is transforming its portrayal of him _ from a violent
revolutionary to a statesman worthy of negotiating with the nation's
white leaders.
   Ambiguity extends even to Mandela, who turns 71 on July 18 and is
serving a life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the
government. He insists he has not changed his views during 27 years
in prison. He has not met the government's demand for an outright
renunciation of violence, and he continues to call for the removal
of a ban on the exiled ANC.
   But Mandela, in a statement released by Prison Services a week
after he met Botha, said, ``I only would like to contribute to the
creation of the climate which would promote peace in South Africa.''
   The policy of the ANC and most sympathetic anti-apartheid groups
has been that no negotiations with the government are possible until
Mandela is freed. Yet the meeting and Mandela's statement can be
interpreted as indicating Mandela has already begun a form of
negotiation.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee, who arranged and attended the
meeting at Botha's official residence, first described it as ``a
courtesy visit.'' A week later he declared it ``a breakthrough.''
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha, mindful of the need to improve South
Africa's image abroad, called it ``an event of the utmost historic
importance.''
   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe, aware of the danger
of startling white voters before the elections, said the meeting was
``part of the broader process of preparing the groundwork for future
negotiations.''
   Only the extreme-right, pro-apartheid Conservative Party has made
its position clear. Conservative Party leader Andries Treurnicht
attacked the government for talking to the ANC and said its
``attempt to enhance Mandela's status to that of a folk hero is
transparent and will not work.''
   Pro-government news media presented Mandela's commitment to peace
as a dramatic change. But it is new in South Africa only because
Mandela's views have been suppressed for so long.
   Mandela's words made headlines around the country and were read
on government-run television and radio. His picture, which cannot be
published legally, has been printed in major newspapers, whose
editors believe they will not be prosecuted.
   First reactions from Mandela's wife, Winnie, and from the Rev.
Frank Chikane, secretary-general of the South African Council of
Churches, suggested Mandela may have been forced into the meeting or
been unaware of its implications.
   Mrs. Mandela and Chikane reversed course after Mandela's
statement, saying the discussions were a positive development rather
than a government ploy.
   ANC spokesman Tom Sebina said in Lusaka, Zambia, ``It would be
wrong for anybody to believe that the meeting signified the start of
negotiations between the black people of South Africa and the
National Party government.''
   He did not react to Mandela's statement, but his comment
contained an important shift. He referred to the ``government,''
instead of the ``apartheid regime.''
   Mandela as a free man, able to act as a politician rather than a
symbol, poses problems that the ANC has not fully addressed.
   Although he is regarded as the ANC leader, the highest post
Mandela held before the organization was outlawed in 1960 was
deputy-president general. The ANC has a president, Oliver Tambo, who
has lived in exile for 29 years.
   Mandela had set guidelines for the ANC's military wing calling
for carefully considered attacks on government targets, and arguing
against acts that would cause indiscriminate deaths, as the ANC's
bombing campaign has done.
   The majority of Mandela's supporters were born after he was
jailed, have never heard his words, and have grown up in an
environment of black-on-black township political strife that did not
exist in 1962.
   ``There has been built up around him such a folklore hero role
that he would be recieved as a hero,'' said Helen Suzman, a white,
anti-apartheid member of Parliament. ``But how does one know what
he's going to suggest to them and what they are prepared to accept?''

<DATELINE>CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not even the same bridge
anymore. New posts and guardrails have been added, but that was some
time ago, and now Dike Bridge is rotting. Gulls fly over and drop
shellfish on it to break open their supper.
   Not much to it. No signs, no reminders.
   But Dike Bridge is on Chappaquiddick.
   It lives oversized in American political history because Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy drove his Oldsmobile off the bridge into Poucha
Pond around midnight 20 years ago.
   Mary Jo Kopechne, a 28-year-old Washington secretary, was found
dead in the back seat about 10 hours later. Kennedy, then 37, did
not notify police until 9:30 a.m., long after he returned to his
hotel, across the water on Martha's Vineyard.
   He said he and two friends repeatedly dove to the car in
unsuccessful rescue attempts, and that he was then ``exhausted and
in a state of shock.''
   Since the accident the night of July 18, 1969, Massachusetts
voters have re-elected Kennedy four times to the Senate by healthy
margins. But most people think the string of events that occurred
after he left a cottage party that night probably cost him the White
House.
   The incident has been an albatross around the island's neck as
well.
   Like Kennedy, most longtime Chappaquiddick residents don't like
to discuss the accident. It is a bitter memory, the day their
pastoral existence became the focus of the worst sort of publicity _
the heir to the Kennedy family dynasty had sullied not just his
reputation but theirs, too.
   When asked about the accident and the impact it's had on their
lives, Vineyarders who have lived in Edgartown or on Chappaquiddick
Island for more than 20 years often become silent.
   One Edgartown real estate agent, usually smiling and friendly,
momentarily choked up when asked about the accident and then refused
to discuss it.
   Jane Tomassian, the head of the Martha's Vineyard Historical
Preservation Society, has lived in Edgartown eight years. She has
sensed some of her neighbors' resentment about the incident.
   ``Martha's Vineyard, pre-Chappaquiddick, was sort of a quiet
vacation spot. The international attention that centered here
immediately after the incident and during the trial, and the focus
that has been put on the Vineyard since then, has really
unfortunately put the Vineyard on the map,'' Tomassian said.
   Kennedy eventually pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an
accident and received a two-month suspended prison sentence. He was
placed on probation for one year.
   Judge James A. Boyle, who oversaw the nine-month inquest,
expressed doubt about key portions of Kennedy's testimony. When
Boyle's final report was released in April 1970, the case was
officially closed. But public debate over its ramifications
continues.
   The Dike Bridge connects a beautiful strip of beach with the rest
of Chappaquiddick Island, at the eastern side of Martha's Vineyard.
In May, tall fences were erected on either side of the bridge _ long
since closed to vehicular traffic _ and the only way to reach the
beach now is to drive an all-terrain vehicle south for about five
miles before doubling back north.
   Town officials are concerned about safety at the bridge, but
sporadic arguments over the years reveal another factor in the move
to tear it down _ embarrassment over the dubious tourist attraction.
   Most tourists don't journey to Martha's Vineyard soley to see the
scene of what has been called ``the most famous traffic fatality in
the history of American politics.'' But, as long as they're down
there, it's right across the ferry ...
   ``Yeah, people ask about it every day,'' said a teen-age girl
running the four-car ferry from Edgartown to Chappaquiddick Island.
``We get a car asking on every trip across.''
   Once tourists get out to Dike Bridge, there's not a lot to see _
just a simple wooden bridge across a decidedly uninteresting pond.
Beyond the bridge are the dunes, and still farther the vast blue of
Nantucket Sound.
   ``They find themselves very disappointed,'' said Patric Jamo, a
waiter at a restaurant on the edge of Edgartown Harbor. ``There's
really nothing there.''
   Linda Malcouronne, the president of the Edgartown Board of Trade
and manager of the Colonial Inn, contends the bridge isn't that much
of a tourist draw. She says most of the summertime tourists choose
the Vineyard for other reasons and visitors might not even be aware
of the significance of the bridge.
   ``It's a whole other time, a time warp,'' Malcouronne said.
   Whether the islanders like it or not, though, the accident is
fixed in their psyche. A headline that appeared in the Vineyard
Gazette referred to the debate over tearing down the ``Kennedy
Bridge.''
   Just up the block from the Colonial Inn is the Shiretown Inn, the
hotel where Kennedy stayed on his visit two decades ago. Kennedy had
walked through the hotel's lobby the morning of the accident and
stood on a balcony talking about yachts with other vacationers
before he filed an accident report with the Edgartown police.
   The new owners of the Shiretown have taken down a sign that hung
behind the front desk telling people not to bother asking about
Chappaquiddick, or what room Kennedy was staying in. But they still
shun inquiries.
   ``We have no comment,'' said a hotel worker who wouldn't give her
name. ``People don't ask about it. It's not a big thing anymore. We
weren't even around then.''
   Kennedy, who has over the years expressed sadness about the
accident, responded with a prepared statement when asked about the
incident recently.
   ``I took full responsibility for the tragedy at the time, and I
still do,'' Kennedy said. ``There was a full and complete
investigation by authorities, and there have been extensive
additional investigations by the press. I have expressed my remorse
and responsibility to my own family, to the Kopechne family, and to
the people of Massachusetts, and I express those sentiments again.
   ``I have told everything I know about the accident. I only wish
that it were in my power to do something more to ease the continuing
pain that I feel and that Mr. and Mrs. Kopechne feel for Mary Jo's
loss.''
   In a recent Associated Press interview, Mary Jo Kopechne's
parents spoke mostly about how they still grieve over the loss of
their daughter.
   Mrs. Kopechne did say she was pleased the foreman in the grand
jury investigation of her daughter's death had recently renewed his
assertion that officials tried to cover up information to protect
Kennedy.
   She had little to say about Kennedy, but in another interview
with a magazine she and her husband had harsh words for the senator.
   ``He was worried about himself, not Mary Jo,'' Joseph Kopechne
said.
   He said his daughter did not die in vain because it kept Kennedy
from becoming president.
   Kopechne and his wife, Gwen, said they had had two brief meetings
with the senator since the accident.
   ``Those were really ridiculous meetings,'' Mrs. Kopechne said.
``Nobody told me anything, and I didn't even know what to ask. I
want him to tell me what happened. Can't he relieve us of this?''

   Authorities raided hotels Saturday to remove
foreign newspapers and magazines as the government stepped up its
campaign to isolate the nation from outside reports critical of its
crackdown on dissent.
   Officials fired the publisher of a pro-Beijing newspaper in Hong
Kong that had criticized the military assault on pro-democracy
protesters in Beijing. The Communist government, acting through its
official Xinhua News Agency, dismissed publisher Lee Tze-chung on
Saturday. Lee said he would fight to stay at the Wen Wei Po
newspaper.
   Staff at hotels catering to foreign tourists in Beijing said
officials appeared without notice Friday and Saturday and removed
all foreign periodicals from bookracks.
   They were told there would be no further sales of Time, Newsweek,
the Asian Wall Street Journal, the Far Eastern Economic Review and
the International Herald Tribune, which have given in-depth coverage
to China's crushing of the student-led movement.
   ``We were very surprised. They came so suddenly,'' said a staffer
at the Jinglun Hotel.
   ``We're just going backward again,'' said an executive at the
Jianguo Hotel, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said most of
the hotel's visitors are businessmen who follow world events and
said ``already people are complaining'' about being cut off from
access to the news.
   The hotels said the China National Import and Export Corp. would
not give a reason for the raid or say how long the halt in sales
would continue.
   Foreign travelers arriving in Beijing have been told not to take
newspapers and magazines off the plane, and transmissions of the
U.S.-funded Voice of America radio have been jammed since the
democracy movement was extinguished more than a month ago.
   Two VOA reporters in Beijing were among seven Western journalists
deported for alleged rumormongering and violations of martial law.
   Chinese authorities July 1 also cut off satellite transmissions
of the U.S. television network CNN to Beijing hotels.
   The attempt to limit access to outside reports began shortly
after the June 3-4 military assault on pro-democracy protesters and
their supporters in central Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   Authorities said about 200 civilians, mostly ``thugs'' and
``ruffians,'' were killed in the assault, but Chinese witnesses and
Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as
high as 3,000.
   The government asserts the use of force was necessary to stop a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' attempting to overthrow the
government.
   The Communist Party's new chief, Jiang Zemin, on Friday told a
meeting on higher education that the nation has failed to provide
adequate ideological education at a time when young people have
become increasingly attracted to the West.
   ``As a result, they are not mentally prepared to face the
hardships and complexities in the socialist construction and the
reform,'' the official Xinhua News Agency quoted him as saying.
   Jiang, named to his post June 24 after moderate Zhao Ziyang was
purged for opposing the use of force against the students, also said
astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and Fang's supporters are ``scum of the
Chinese intellectuals.'' Fang, a frequent critic of the Communist
government, and his wife Li Shuxian have been sheltered in the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing since June 4.

   A dentist was accused of passing
state secrets to the Soviet Union after police found military
hardware and classified documents in his apartment, newspapers
reported Saturday.
   The 47-year-old man allegedly spied for the Soviet military
intelligence service, GRU, over an eight-year period, according to
the reports.
   The man, who runs an import-export business in addition to his
dental practice in this Amsterdam suburb, was arrested May 17 when
he was about to fly out of the country, the press reports said. They
said the man was released last week pending charges.
   Neither the man nor his firm was identified in any of the
reports, in line with Dutch media practice on police and judicial
cases.
   The Amsterdam newspaper De Volkskrant said police and
investigators of the Dutch Domestic Security Service found large
numbers of classified documents on military products made by Dutch
firms inside the man's apartment.
   However, it was not clear from any of the reports what material
the man allegedly passed to the Soviets, or how much damage the
activities had caused.
   The Interior Ministry, which is responsible for counterespionage,
was closed and not immediately available for comment.
   According to De Volkskrant, the papers found in the apartment
related to various kinds of high-technology military products,
including computer systems.
   If convicted of espionage, the man could face a 15-year prison
term.
   Dutch officials have repeatedly said the GRU and its civilian
counterpart, the KGB, have been stepping up their espionage efforts,
especially in the field of advanced technology.

   Easy Riders Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper
joined 900 others for a 20th anniversary reunion and retrospective
showing of the classic biker film.
   About 50 motorcycles were parked outside the Sweeney Convention
Center on Friday, and Fonda called ``Easy Rider'' ``the best
motorcycle film ever made.''
   He also called it ``one of the greatest Westerns of all times.''
   The $25-a-ticket gala drew fans in attire ranging from
bell-bottom jeans, black T-shirts, leather vests and chains to Santa
Fe chic.
   Asked how things have changed since 1969, when the movie was
released, Fonda said: ``Things have gotten ... worse.''
   Hopper disagreed.
   ``We're not at war. ... We can all drink from the same water
fountains. Women have more rights. Blacks and minorities have more
rights. Basically, today, most people have become involved. But
there are still lots of problems, especially inside urban cities. So
it's the same old stuff,'' Hopper said.
   The times may have changed, but Fonda said his values haven't,
although they're ``broader in their base, more articulate in their
exposition and fortified by what I see around me.''
   ``The attitudes we put together when we wrote and shot `Easy
Rider,' have been fortified, not rectified,'' he added.
   He said also that he may have lost his idealism, but ``I'm much
stronger today than I was then.''

   Prince Andrew and
Sarah's second day in Canada took a musical turn _ some of it off
key.
   Britain's Duke and Duchess of York attended a gala performance of
Encore, a retrospective celebrating 25 years of musicals at the
Charlottetown Festival.
   Earlier in the day, the royal couple visisted Queen Elizabeth
Hospital, where inside a cramped playroom in the pediatrics ward,
Sarah mesmerized a shy toddler with a game of Itsy Bitsy Spider.
   As a tinny recording of the Stompin' Tom Connors classic blared
from a loudspeaker, the royal couple left the hospital and waded
into a large crowd to charm and chat.
   Moments later a live country and western band kicked in with a
twangy version of Coat of Many Colors.
   Not everyone was happy with the selection.
   ``I've been coming to these things for 30 years and that was an
absolute disgrace,'' said one man who refused to give his name.
``Here they were trying to talk to people and they couldn't hear
themselves because of hillybilly music.''

   Singer-songwriter Loudon Wainwright
III doesn't care if he's making people laugh or cry as long as
they're feeling something.
   ``I'd like to try to do both, preferably at the same time,'' he
said. ``The most painful things quite often can be funny.''
   Wainwright, 42, has made a career out of being the comedian and
melancholy guy. His first hit, in 1972, was about a dead skunk, but
his latest album is titled ``Therapy.''
   ``I want to be known as a guy who writes good songs,'' he said
Tuesday from Boston. ``And if it's humorous, great. If it's serious
or tragicomedy or whatever you want to call it, you know, as long as
it's good and it affects people.''
   Wainwright has yet to score a Grammy, though he's been nominated
twice. The former drama student also has acted on stage, screen and
television.
   ``We haven't got there yet,'' said Wainwright, who maintains
homes in New York and London. ``It'll be the year that I win the
Grammy, the Oscar and the Tony.''

   Expatriate ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev
is thinking of visiting the Soviet Union for the first time since he
defected 28 years ago.
   ``Unfortunately, since the bureaucracy in this country is so
huge, I expect I'll be 100 years old before I get back,'' he said in
an interview after arriving here for a series of performances in
Mexico.
   Nureyev, 51, said he would like to visit the Kirov Theater, where
he began his career.
   He said that many dancer-defectors eventually returned to the
Soviet Union because they could not adjust to new lifestyles.
Nureyev defected in 1961 while on tour with the Bolshoi Ballet. He
is a British citizen.
   Nureyev said he found what he was looking for.
   ``I came to the West and danced the great dances,'' he said.

   Country singer Kathy Mattea says music is
the only thing that ever held her interest.
   ``I'm in it because it's so much fun,'' she said. ``That's what
keeps me going.''
   Ms. Mattea's big break came in 1983 when she signed for her first
album, ``Kathy Mattea.'' The latest of her four No. 1 singles is
``Come from the Heart.''
   Ms. Mattea says she's earned her keep during her relatively short
but fruitful career. She tours extensively in the summer and is
scheduled for a concert July 31 in Kingsport.
   Ms. Mattea said she was a student at West Virginia University
when she decided to move to Nashville to seek her fortune.
   ``The guy that I'd been writing music with decided he was going
to move to Nashville,'' she said. ``And I thought if he goes there
and gets famous without me I'd never forgive myself.''

   Martial law has not changed the summer rhythm of
this dusty city. A hot sun hypnotizes its 10 million residents into
slow motion, and soldiers stand sleepily under bright umbrellas.
   The soldiers squint and play idly with the safety catches on
their automatic rifles. It is possible to catch them napping,
stocking feet sticking out the windows of a parked army jeep.
   Some people stroll up to them boldly, ask them where they are
from and offer them soda.
   But despite the mantra-like assurances of city authorities,
Beijing has not returned to normal. Arrests continue of people who
took part in the student-led protests for democratic reform. Some
people are taken away as looking ``suspicious,'' questioned, beaten
and released.
   A bookstore where liberals used to meet has been closed. The
latest issue of a magazine has been halted at the post office
because of an article that censors deemed harmful.
   Books by scholars who are wanted by police have been banned, and
Culture Ministry workers have raided private bookstalls to seize
copies. At least one book has been banned even as it was being
published, a Chinese source said.
   Countless people pass their days in fear of punishment under the
government's harsh new policy emphasizing class struggle and the
need to stamp out Western-style liberalism.
   ``I invited you to come to our home for lunch and we bought beer
and things to make dumplings, but I'm sorry, you can't come,'' a
Chinese intellectual said with embarrassment as he met a Western
friend recently.
   ``They said foreigners should not come to our homes,'' he
explained. Even meeting a Westerner in public made him fearful, and
he cast nervous glances around him.
   ``Things will get better, let's wait a few months,'' he said
before merging with relief into the crowd.
   He was brave to keep the appointment. Many Chinese have stopped
answering their telephones and few are willing to talk to foreigners.
   ``It's like the Cultural Revolution,'' said a European reporter
who was in China during the 1966-76 upheaval, during which almost
all contact between Chinese and foreigners was forbidden.
   Asked about the restrictions, government spokesman Yuan Mu said
it was for the foreigners' protection ``because there are so many
Chinese and you don't know who is good and who is bad. It is not
written on their foreheads.''
   All over the city, hundreds of thousands of teachers, doctors,
journalists and factory workers who cheered or joined in the
7-week-long protests face investigation.
   Most will not be arrested, predicted a Chinese source, but they
will spend several tense weeks as Communist Party officials at their
work units investigate their cases. At a minimum, they will be
required to acknowledge the error of their ways, the source said.
   Political education already has begun for work units, protesters
and bystanders alike. Graduating college students spent several
weeks studying speeches by top leaders condemning the protests as
the work of traitors.
   Participants were urged to speak their hearts, according to one
official newspaper, but several said they just repeated words from
the speeches.
   Teachers also have had long study sessions. Education appears
lightest for production line workers, who are being pressed to make
up for the losses of the weeks of protest.
   Testimonials from protesters have begun appearing in the official
media, confessing their actions but saying they now understand and
approve the government's crackdown.
   ``Motherland, country, we were wrong,'' said one statement
attributed to a group of students.
   The relaxed attitude of the soldiers belies the tight security.
New plainclothes guards watch comings and goings at foreign
apartment compounds and several embassies, including the American
Embassy, where leading dissident Fang Lizhi has taken shelter.
   Chinese who enter a major office tower must show identification.
Switchboard operators at some Chinese government units demand
callers identify themselves before putting them through.
   Soldiers check the papers of Chinese who emerge from their
stifling homes at night to catch a cool breeze on the sidewalk.
After 11 p.m., soldiers stop cars at main intersections and question
drivers.
   When an army motorcycle broke down during the day on one street,
a jeep of armed soldiers stopped to guard it while repairs were made.
   When two bicyclists got into an argument, drawing a small crowd,
soldiers quickly dispersed it.
   And yet the security appears to have gaps. A foreigner recently
reported seeing a naked body floating in a canal near his home.

   A custody battle has begun over notebooks kept
by former National Security Aide Oliver North during the Iran-Contra
affair: the NSC won't take them, despite a claim by North's
prosecutors that it is the rightful owner.
   Prosecutors were rebuffed by the Bush administration when they
attempted to turn over the copies to the NSC staff last month,
administration and congressional sources say.
   The administration is concerned that once the security council
regains possession, Congress can move to have the long sought-after
documents declassified, an administration source acknowledged.
   The Justice Department is looking at legal questions surrounding
a possible transfer of the spiral-bound notebooks, department
spokesman David Runkel said. North still holds the originals.
   According to sources, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh assured
Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Claiborne Pell in a
letter June 23 that the prosecutor would send copies of the
notebooks to the NSC so that they might be made available to
Congress.
   The Senate panel has been trying since April 1988 to subpoena the
notebooks, which North took with him the day he was fired from the
NSC on Nov. 25, 1986. His lawyers blacked out portions of 1,269 of
the 2,848 pages of copies supplied to the Iran-Contra investigating
committees.
   The books contain North's hand-written, daily records of meetings
and phone calls about the Iran arms sales and secret assistance to
the Contras. They also contain references to allegations of
narcotics trafficking in connection with various arms dealers who
were supplying the Contras.
   During Walsh's investigation of North, North invoked his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination in initially refusing to
turn them over. But North had to submit them three months ago when
he decided to testify near the close of his criminal trial.
   Pell, D-Rhode Island, pressed Walsh for copies in a letter June
20, to which Walsh responded three days later.
   ``It is my understanding that the National Security Council
rergards these notebooks as its documents,'' Walsh said. ``We shall
supply a copy of these documents to the National Security Council
along with a copy of your letter expressing a need for them.
   ``It would then be appropriate for ... your Counsel ... to
request the declassification of these documents so that they could
be utilized by the Committee.''
   A courier from the independent counsel's office subsequently
tried to deliver the copies, said one source familiar with the
episode.
   When NSC staffers opened a package containing the copies, ``they
refused to take custody of them, saying they're not the property of
the NSC,'' said the source.
   ``It was somebody's assumption at the independent counsel's
office that `If we send it, they'll take it,''' said one
administration source familiar with the matter.
   ``Some of the concern has to do with distribution after they get
to the executive branch,'' one Bush administration official
acknowledged, referring to Congress' interest in obtaining the
notebooks.
   Runkel of the Justice Department said there has been ``no
determination about what should be done'' with the prosecutors'
copies ``or whether we should seek to get the notebooks back from
North himself.''
   Runkel declined further comment. At Walsh's office, spokeswoman
Mary Belcher declined all comment on the notebooks.
   North was compelled to produce them to prosecutors under an April
6 court order by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell.
   One question is whether Gesell intended to restrict the
independent counsel's authority to turn its copies over to someone
else, said one Bush administration official.
   ``This can be simply resolved: go ask Judge Gesell,'' said the
official. ``The independent counsel is afraid North is going to
object. The right way is to give notice that they would be inclined
to turn over the notebooks to the NSC and give North a chance to be
heard.''
   The wording of Gesell's order places no restrictions on what
Walsh may do with the notebooks.
   It says simply that North ``shall forthwith produce to the
Government ... Spiral bound notebooks used ... in the course of,
and-or to assist him in, his duties at the National Security
Council'' from October 1984 to Nov. 25, 1986.
   Ultimately, ownership of the the notebooks will have to be
determined, said another administration source.
   ``If they are presidential records, they probably belong to the
Reagan administration and would go to the Reagan library in
California,'' said the Bush administration source. ``It's pretty
clear the documents don't belong to this administration. They're not
Bush presidency documents.''
   North testified in his trial that he regarded the notebooks as
his personal property and that he had intended to destroy them as
one of his last acts at the NSC.
   North testified that he took them away with him the day he was
fired because his lawyer at the time, Thomas Green, had advised him
to do so.
   ``I was advised to keep things that would indicate that I had
authority'' from Reagan administration higher-ups for his activities
in the Iran-Contra affair, said North, who was convicted of three
felonies in the scandal.
   Prosecutors at his trial were able to make almost no use of the
thousands of pages of notebooks in cross-examining North because he
had been forced to give them the material only a few days earlier.

<HEAD>Bentsen Wants Rural Areas Included In Drug-Control Blueprint</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The national anti-drug strategy due out this
fall must look beyond the big cities and address the rapid spread of
the cocaine derivative crack to rural areas, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen said
Saturday.
   Bentsen said he is asking national drug control director William
Bennett, who is drawiing up the anti-drug blueprint, to include
``measures to combat the serious and growing problem of drug abuse
in smaller towns and the rural countryside.''
   The Texas Democrat said he wants to be sure the Drug Enforcement
Administration ``doesn't limit its efforts to just the big dealers
and the big cities, that we include rural and small towns too.''
   In one rural Texas area, authorities report an 80 percent
increase in crack cases in just one year, Bentsen said.
   ``If you ignore that kind of an increase you do so at your own
peril,'' Bentsen said in his letter to Bennett. ``It's absolutely
imperative that we have an overall program that takes care of not
just the large cities but the small towns, rural areas in addition.''
   Bennett must complete the first comprehensive national
drug-control plan by Sept. 5.
   Bentsen said he was concerned about a recent DEA memorandum that
said crack dealers in smaller communities ``do not merit full
federal investigative efforts'' since they typically limit their
sales to small quantities.
   A DEA survey in 1986 found crack available in 28 states and the
District of Columbia. Another DEA survey in December 1987 found that
number had jumped to 45 states, Bentsen said.
   And while the survey noted that crack cocaine remained primarily
an inner city problem, it noted that ``recent seizures indicate that
crack has appeared in rural parts of Georgia, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, North Carolina, Delaware, Maryland, New
York and California.''

<HEAD>Eight Weeks to Primary; Koch Makes it Official</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL STIEG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight weeks before the primary Ed Koch's job is
clear: He either makes up ground fast or makes plans to step aside
for New York City's first black mayor, or its first Republican mayor
in two decades.
   ``Sixteen points in this day and age is not an insurmountable
margin by any means, as I was telling President Dukakis,'' quipped
David Garth, Koch's media adviser, on Friday.
   Garth was as surprised as anyone Thursday when Koch chose a
midday radio talk show to announce officially his candidacy for an
unprecedented fourth term. Not that there was any doubt _ he made
his intentions obvious last year and started television ads this
month.
   ``I think I've done a lot of good things. I've done a couple of
stupid things,'' said Koch, 64. ``I've done things that I would do
over and differently but that's water over the dam.
   ``I believe that my three terms will be perceived historically as
very good for the city of New York.''
   His opponents, and many pundits, think the outspoken Koch already
is history. David Dinkins, the Manhattan borough president, leads
Koch by 13 to 15 points in Democratic polls; the latest had him
ahead 45 percent to 31 percent. Getting more than 40 percent of the
vote in the Sept. 12 primary would enable Dinkins to avoid a primary
runoff.
   The likely Republican is former federal prosecutor Rudolph
Giuliani, who is far ahead of his GOP rival, cosmetics heir Ronald
Lauder. A Daily News-WABC-TV poll looking ahead to likely November
matchups puts Giuliani neck and neck with Dinkins, and ahead of
Koch, 49 percent to 33 percent.
   Two other Democrats, Comptroller Harrison Goldin and former
transit chief Richard Ravitch, remain stalled in single digits in
their primary bids.
   ``What's going on, I think, is the public is shutting its mind to
Ed Koch after 12 insulting years,'' said Mark Green, a Dinkins
adviser and former Senate candidate. ``I think I hear a collective,
`Enough, already.'''
   Koch received 78 percent of the vote last time he ran, back in
1985 when voters didn't have AIDS, crack and homelessness in mind.
His third term began with a corruption scandal, now all but
overshadowed by more pressing human problems.
   ``Do you know anyone who has solved AIDS or solved drugs or
housing in this country?'' Koch asks.
   His issue-oriented TV ads, featuring regular folks, carry the
slogan ``He tackles the tough ones'' in what is ``still the second
toughest job in America.''
   That still leaves corruption, crime, education and race _ this
last issue possibly crucial. Koch rankled blacks with his criticism
of the Rev. Jesse Jackson in last year's presidential primary, and
73 percent of blacks polled say they favor Dinkins, the first black
with a real shot at the mayor's mansion.
   The 62-year-old Dinkins, a relatively quiet, conciliatory
politician, delivered 135,386 signatures to the Board of Elections
on Thursday, far more than he needed and more than three times what
Koch collected.
   ``I'm sure he's pretty good at arithmetic and he would recognize
that this reflects an awful lot of support, a broad base,'' Dinkins
said.
   Said Koch, who began his political career as a reformer, but
twice was reelected with the backing of Democratic powers: ``He's
the machine candidate. What would you expect?''
   There have been other ironies so far in the campaign.
   Giuliani, 45, who built his reputation busting Wall Streeters,
mobsters and corrupt officials, found himself last week defending
the hiring of three lawyers who admitted having used drugs.
   Koch, of all people, paraphrased Jackson in Thursday's
announcement: ``I don't think God is finished with me yet and I want
to do more for this city.''
   Then there is Lauder's multimillion-dollar television onslaught,
in which a voice dripping with disgust calls Giuliani a liberal.
   A complicating factor in the race is the existence in New York of
small Conservative and Liberal parties, which enable candidates to
run even if they lose one of the two major primaries.
   Giuliani has already been endorsed by the Liberal Party, as was
Republican John Lindsay in 1965, and would run on that ticket in
addition to the GOP ticket if he wins in September.
   But Giuliani's stance against abortion has reduced his support,
the Daily News-WABC-TV poll indicated. Gays have criticized his
opposition to Koch's proposal to extend paid time off to city
employees grieving deaths of live-in companions.
   Lauder, who entered the race at the urging of Republican Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, a rival of Giuliani, will likely remain in the race
on the Conservative line, and the votes he would get could hurt
Giuliani in a close general election.
   For his part, Garth says Koch has been creeping up in the polls,
from the mid-20s to the low 30s. ``My feeling is he's bottomed out
and is now moving up,'' Garth said, adding that polls don't show
Dinkins' supporters as particularly ardent.
   ``The way this business usually works, once you make that turn
and start to come back, you gather momentum,'' he said.
   Green said Koch is behind ``because he's an insult artist, yet
the more he now attacks Dave Dinkins, the more he reminds people
what they like least about him. I don't see how he gets out of this
box.''
   Countered Garth: ``There's no way to kill the spirit in him.''

   The country's largest black
union said Saturday it wants to form a huge anti-apartheid coalition
to coordinate strategies among opposition groups.
   The National Union of Mineworkers said it will seek to arrange a
conference no later than October to bring together the ``core forces
of the mass democratic movement.''
   ``It is important to win over all anti-apartheid forces to our
side,'' said the union, which has about 300,000 members.
   Anti-apartheid groups have been urgently trying to formulate
unified strategies since the July 5 meeting between President P.W.
Botha and jailed black nationalist Nelson Mandela, leader of the
African National Congress.
   Opposition groups initially dismissed the talks as government
propaganda that involved no shift in policy. But several
organizations revised their assessment and called it a positive
development after Mandela released a statement Wednesday indicating
he welcomed the chance to talk with Botha.
   The mineworkers union said the Congress of South African Trade
Unions _ the country's largest labor federation _ and the United
Democratic Front _ the largest anti-apartheid coalition _ would play
leading roles in the coalition it sought to establish.
   However, both groups are banned from participating in political
activities.
   The mineworkers did not explain how these organizations could
become active in politics.
   The outlawed ANC and other anti-apartheid groups have said there
can be no negotiations with the government until it meets several
basic demands, such as freeing all political prisoners, legalizing
banned organizations and lifting the state of emergency.
   The anti-apartheid movement has found it increasingly difficult
to organize under the 3-year-old state of emergency, during which
more than 30 opposition groups have been banned.
   Mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government.
   His meeting with Botha suggests the ANC leader is willing to talk
with the government, though his demand for a non-racial democracy in
South Africa is unchanged.
   The white-led government also appears to have eased its policy of
having no contact with the ANC, which it labels a terrorist
organization.
   Under South Africa's apartheid policies, the 28 million blacks
have no voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the
government and economy, while maintaining separate neighborhoods,
schools and health facilities.

   Mayor Coleman Young is preparing to announce
whether he will run for a fifth term this week as even some of his
supporters say he should step down at age 71.
   Eight weeks remain before the Sept. 12 non-partisan primary when
voters will select two candidates for a Nov. 7 runoff.
   Young, the city's first black mayor, is expected to announce his
plans Tuesday. He has hinted for months that he would run but left
open the possibility he would retire.
   ``If I announce, then I will announce when I announce,'' Young
said, a comment typical in tone of his chilly relations with
reporters, which his aides blame in part on media racism.
   Young, if he does run for another four-year term, would enter as
the solid front-runner, able to cite progress in areas such as
integrating the police force but also in spite of an array of
problems facing the city.
   He has a largely untapped campaign fund estimated at $5 million,
and is considered to hold a commanding lead over accountant Thomas
Barrow, who won the right to face him in the runoff four years ago
and is expected to do so again this year. Barrow reportedly has less
than $300,000 available for his campaign.
   Young, a former union organizer, has been in office since 1973,
the same year Tom Bradley of Los Angeles and Maynard Jackson of
Atlanta came to power in the early generation of big-city black
mayors.
   Barrow, 40, is founder and president of Michigan's largest
minority-owned accounting firm and a nephew of the late boxing great
Joe Louis. He received only 39 percent of the vote when he ran
against Young in 1985, but this year has been campaigning
door-to-door, while Young schedules about four public appearances a
week, nonchalantly skipping some of them.
   Other challengers include Detroit City Council President Erma
Henderson and longshots Charles Costa and James A. Williams Sr. The
filing deadline for candidates is July 25.
   Barrow and the others blame Young for the continuing decline of
Detroit's neighborhoods. Opponents say Young has concentrated on pet
downtown development projects at the expense of neighborhood upkeep
and services.
   And some longtime supporters, including Detroit's veteran black
congressmen John Conyers and George Crockett, also say it is time
for Detroit to have a new mayor.
   Crockett said he thinks Young should step down for his own
health, though Young has no outward signs of decline. Crockett, who
turns 80 next month, said he can give a younger man such advice
because he has fewer problems in Congress than Young has as mayor.
   Conyers was more outspoken, accusing the mayor of arrogance and
saying he has ``an unbroken record of personal and political
mistakes in the last few years.''
   ``Coleman's dead,'' Conyers said. ``It's time for him to go.'' He
said the mayor ``has lost sight of serving the people and has
created a political machine interested only in its own power.''
Conyers denies his comments are meant to promote a candidacy by
brother Nathan, a Detroit businessman. Nathan Conyers also denies he
has any interest in being mayor.
   Young, an ardent civil rights activist in this predominantly
black city, seemed to emerge unscathed politically last year after
criticizing the Rev. Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign, saying a
black man had no legitimate chance of winning and backing
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   But the mayor has other problems.
   Detroit's population has dropped from about 2 million in 1950 to
about 1 million today. The flight to outlying suburbs has left
behind thousands of boarded-up, burned-out houses that attract drug
dealers and other crime. Some fed-up residents, tired of waiting for
city demolition crews, have even torn down abandoned houses
themselves.
   Though Young's opponents have avoided mention of it, Young also
faces a paternity suit filed against him by Annivory Calvert, a
former assistant director in Detroit's Department of Public Works
who now lives in California.
   Young, who is single, at first denied the child was his. But in
May, blood tests proved he was the father of Ms. Calvert's
6-year-old son, Joel Loving. The mayor is paying $200 a week in
child support until the court sets a final amount.
   Other issues facing the mayor include:
   _Detroit's trash-burning incinerator, which has angered
environmentalists who say pollution standards for the $420 million
project to create energy by burning wastes are too low.
   _A deal involving the city's acquisition of land for a $1 billion
Chrysler Corp. assembly plant, which is being investigated by a
federal grand jury amid charges the city paid $40 million for used
machinery worth $2 million in condemned buildings on the plant site.
There's no suggestion that Young himself is suspected of criminal
wrongdoing.
   _Young's hostile relations with reporters, and negative coverage
that the mayor's staff blames on institutional racism. Young
rebuffed numerous requests for an interview by The Associated Press.
   Young has been particularly unhappy with local coverage of the
police force, a once-predominantly white department whose racial
integration has been a source of pride for the mayor.
   Fred Martin, Young's chief executive assistant, said the makeover
of the force was ignored by local media. Specifically, Martin said,
a group of newspaper columnists ``constantly dump on the mayor.''
   ``We do think there is a little different standard for Coleman
Young,'' he said. ``I'm not saying that it is conscious or
deliberate.''

   HUD has turned over to the Justice Department
records that show a former top official passed over
financially-strapped housing projects in favor of doling out
emergency funds to a one-time business associate and donors to his
pet charity.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development's inspector
general concluded in a March audit that at least 11 of 25 projects
funded through the emergency set-aide program in 1987 and 1988 did
not meet agency guidelines. Several well-connected developers
received multiple awards from the fund.
   Seven projects that exceeded guidelines were bypassed; they
eventually went under and had to be taken over by HUD, which over
time will cost the government millions of dollars, the auditors
concluded.
   HUD investigators said those decisions were made by Thomas T.
Demery, who at the time was HUD's assistant secretary for housing.
He left the agency last year and opened a consulting business but
has been beleaguered of late with questions about his actions at HUD.
   The department is the focus of internal, congressional and
Justice Department investigations of fraud, mismanagement and
influence-peddling during President Reagan's tenure.
   Demery, 39, in a brief interview Thursday, denied favoritism
played a role in any funding decisions. ``It was all done on the
merits,'' he said.
   But department officials, in the report that HUD sources said has
been forwarded to Justice as part of its investigation of the
troubled housing agency, said ``assistance was provided to projects
that were neither approvable under the regulations nor demonstrated
an emergency need.'' The sources spoke on condition they not be
identified.
   The Section 8 loan management set aside fund is used to help
struggling housing projects that already have some type of
government financing. Guidelines allow the emergency assistance in
cases when low occupancy or other problems have caused severe
financial problems. The infusion of HUD money, through the use of
low-income rent subsidies, is designed to prevent a more costly
default.
   The emergency accounts totaled $42 million during the two-year
audit period; $36 million of that went to the 11 questionable
projects chosen by Demery for help.
   Of those 11, six did not demonstrate a cash-flow problem and the
five others were ineligible for funding because of poor maintenance,
management or other problems, HUD investigators concluded. In
addition, some of the projects had not even applied locally for
funding, and in other cases local HUD officials had rejected
applications, the auditors said.
   The investigators said they could find no documentation to
support Demery's decisions.
   What can be found through review of the HUD records, Demery's
financial disclosure statements and other records is that Demery had
past ties to at least one of the developers who got emergency
funding. Several others were contributors to FOOD for Africa, a
Michigan-based charity Demery helped found.
   A separate audit of a HUD rehabilitation program also found
scores of occasions in which FOOD donors won lucrative government
subsidies. Demery attended several fund-raisers for the charity that
were hosted by developers. He has repeatedly denied that the
donations affected his HUD decisions.
   A review of Demery's telephone and appointment logs by The
Associated Press also indicated that several of the developers who
got emergency funding called Demery several times in the period that
those and other funding decisions about their HUD projects were made.
   _ Emergency funding went to two projects owned by Robert
Rohlwing, with whom Demery in 1984 was involved in a small mortgage
venture. One of the projects was poorly maintained and the other
scored zero on a test for need, auditors said. Demery awarded
Rohlwing $342,000 immediately, with the possibility he could get up
to $1.7 million over several years. Rohlwing donated $1,000 to FOOD
in 1987.
   Demery's phone logs, obtained through The Freedom of Information
Act, show numerous calls from Rohlwing. Rohlwing did not return a
reporter's telephone call to his Chicago office last week.
   _ Another name found a number of times on the logs is that of
Allan Bird, a developer of more than 100 HUD projects who got
$405,000 in emergency funding for an apartment complex in Boston
that failed quality standards. To make repairs, Bird got an
additional $1 million from HUD. He donated $2,500 to FOOD in 1987.
   _ Demery awarded $142,000 to the Amy Jo Manor in Grand Rapids,
Mich., a project auditors said did not meet requirements for
emergency aid. The project is owned by a group called PM One Inc.,
which donated $2,000 to FOOD. A related company also donated to the
charity.
   The president of PM One Inc., Daniel Armstead, did not return a
telephone call to his Michigan office.
   Demery in 1984 received a fee of at least $5,000 from a related
company, PMI Inc., for consulting work. At the time he was a
Michigan real estate consultant and mortgage broker who did some HUD
contracting work.
   _ One of the owners of another projects that received emergency
assistance, Jeffrey I. Friedman, also donated $1,000 to FOOD in
October 1987. The auditors, however, did not question the
eligibility of that project, Somerset West apartments in North
Royalton, Ohio, which received $180,000 from Demery.
   _ Seven of the 25 projects given emergency funding over the
two-year period were in Demery's home state of Michigan. His phone
logs show he kept close ties with his business associates there,
often receiving several calls a day from Michigan developers.
   Irving Seligman, a Southfield, Mich., developer who got emergency
assistance for three projects that auditors said were not eligible,
said the frequency of the awards to Michigan was not due to
favoritism but because of struggling developments in low-income
areas.
   Demery approved $426,000 in emergency funding for two projects
Seligman owned in Taylor, Mich., over the objections of local HUD
and government officials who said the area already had too much
subsidized housing. The third project, in Phoenix, got $347,000 even
though it already had more subsidized apartments than HUD guidelines
allowed, the auditors said.
   Seligman said he knew Demery from his HUD-related work in
Michigan in the early 1980s and spoke to him often. But he said he
did not believe he had any special influence with Demery, who has
said he approved the funding because he thought the local objections
stemmed from a personality clash.

<TEXT>
   For the first time in its 30-year
history, the New Athens Homecoming Pageant won't have a Miss New
Athens to crown.
   None of the town's teen-age girls wanted to compete for the
crowning Sunday night, organizers say.
   ``Maybe there's a change in the wind,'' said Doni-Mae Rauch,
co-chairman of the homecoming committee. ``It might be a thing of
the past. It is a shame to see it go.''
   The contest, sponsored by the New Athens Women's Club, is not a
beauty pageant. Rather, the girl age 16 to 19 who sells the most $1
tickets for raffle chances automatically becomes homecoming queen,
Rauch said.
   The money collected benefits the New Athens Commercial Club,
which promotes business and industry in New Athens and the
surrounding area.
   ``I am a little disappointed that nobody shows that much interest
in helping the town nd raising the money,'' Miss New Athens 1988
Denise Range said. ``But hopefully it will happen again next year.''
   The queen receives a cash prize plus a commission, jewelry, a
sterling silver bowl, a tiara and a portrait session.
   ``For some reason this year, we didn't find anyone willing to win
a guaranteed $500 first prize plus a percentage of sales over
$1,000,'' Rauch said.
   Laurel Ruhmann, who became Miss New Athens in 1985 after selling
2,000 tickets, isn't surprised by the lack of interest.
   ``I can kind of understand,'' she said. ``It's hard work.''
   The pageant won't have a queen, but it might still have a raffle.
   High school cheerleaders are selling tickets, as are the town's
Rotary Club, Lions Club and Fellowship of Christian Athletes.
   Next year, the New Athens committee might open the contest to
boys, just as neighboring Marissa is doing this year.
   ``We're going to keep an eye on that,'' Rauch said. ``It is a
very valid possibility and something we might consider.''

   Joseph B. Gildenhorn, the lawyer and real
estate developer named by President Bush as U.S. ambassador to
Switzerland, and his immediate family gave nearly $230,000 to
Republican campaigns since 1984, disclosure statements show.
   Gildenhorn, according to Senate sources, is one of several Bush
ambassadorial nominees who have been rated ``unqualified'' by the
American Academy of Diplomacy, an organization composed of former
high ranking diplomats, including all living former secretaries of
state.
   One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporters and
contributors named to diplomatic posts, Gildenhorn gave $100,000
during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National
State Elections Committee. The gift was not subject to the
disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act.
   The 84 contributions made between 1984 and early this year by
Gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by
Senate Democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many GOP
contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved
for Foreign Service professionals.
   Gildenhorn said Friday he could not comment because he is ``in a
confirmation process.''
   A report prepared by the State Department for the Foreign
Relations Committee said Gildenhorn would make an ``excellent''
candidate for an ambassadorship because of his ``solid background in
law and management.''
   It also cited another qualification.
   ``Mr. Gildenhorn has been a strong Republican supporter being a
member of the Eagles and Team 100,'' the State Department said.
   The Republican Eagles are contributors of $10,000 or more in a
single year to the Republican National Committee, while Team 100
designates people who have donated $100,000 or more.
   Gildenhorn's political contributions are listed on a disclosure
form submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which has
set a hearing on the nomination for this week.
   They totaled $14,675 in 1984, $17,000 in 1985; $25,469.97 in
1986; $25,250 in 1987; $104,350 in 1988; and $11,000 this year. The
total: $197,744.97.
   Additionally, his wife, Alma Lee, gave $20,125 over the six
years, including $13,000 in 1988; his daughter, Carolyn, gave
$2,000; his son, Michael, gave $4,050 and his father, Oscar
Gildenhorn, gave $5,750.
   That brings the total contributions made by Gildenhorn and his
family to the GOP to $229,669.97 since 1984.
   Gildenhorn gave $50,000 during the period to the Republican
National Committee or to the Republican Eagles.
   He gave $2,500 in 1985 and $5,000 in 1986 to the Fund for the
American Future, a Bush political action committee and contributed
the legal limit of $1,000 to the Bush campaign in 1987.
   Gildenhorn also gave thousands of dollars to Republican
congressional candidates. Included were gifts to the campaigns of
Sens. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn.; Bill Cohen, R-Maine; Pete Domenici,
R-N.M.; Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; John Warner, R-Va.; Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; and former Sen. Paula Hawkins, R-Fla.
   Gildenhorn, 59, is a senior partner in Brown, Gildenhorn and
Jacobs, a law firm specializing in real estate. He is also president
of the JBG Real Estate Associates and JBG Properties Inc.
   Gildenhorn is also vice chairman of the board of directors of the
Sovran Bank here. He is a graduate of the University of Maryland and
Yale University Law School.
   Other ambassadorial nominees rated as unqualified by the American
Academy of Diplomacy include Florida real estate developer Joseph
Zappala, nominated as ambassador to Spain; Melvin L. Sembler, a real
estate executive in Florida named to be ambassador to Australia; and
Della M. Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker named to be
ambassador to New Zealand.
   No action has been taken by the Senate on any of those
nominations.
   According to Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who first raised the
issue of political contributions, Zappala and Sembler each
contributed more than $100,000 to Republican candidates and causes.
   Mrs. Newman served as chairman of the Washington state Bush for
President committee.
   Ambassador David Popper, president of the Academy of Diplomacy,
declined to confirm that Gildenhorn and the other three nominees had
been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors.
   But he said the academy does offer such ratings, making its
judgments based on a comparison of the nominee's biography and the
requirements of the job.
   He said the nonpartisan academy has no objections to political
appointees as such but does believe political nominees should be
qualified to run a complex embassy and represent the United States
abroad with ``dignity, respect and ability.''
   Twenty of 29 ambassadorial nomination made by Bush in the first
six months of his administration have gone to non-professionals,
many of them large contributors to Republican causes, committee
sources said.
   Sarbanes says the appointments are larding the diplomatic corps
with amateurs rewarded for purely political services.
   ``Political throwaways,'' Sarbanes calls them.
   ``I think the time has come, very frankly, to get off the money
merry-go-round and ask some very difficult questions, essentially
about when extensive political contributions are going to be a
sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination,'' Sarbanes
told the committee last month.
   ``It's not true in every instance, but in most of these cases you
seem to have to be over the $100,000 mark in order to make the
consideration list,'' Sarbanes said.
   Sarbanes says he is not against political ambassadors as such,
noting that many of them compiled distinguished records.
   ``It is not the political ambassadors that are the problem,''
Sarbanes said. ``It is ambassadors without qualifications.''

   Hundreds of hotels and inns closed their doors
Saturday after tremors and the threat of a new volcanic eruption
caused thousands of tourists to cancel their reservations in this
seaside resort.
   Hiroko Seki, a spokeswoman for Japan's coast guard, said bubbles
were seen Saturday near the site of an underwater volcano several
miles off Ito that erupted Thursday.
   Nobuo Fukuda, a Central Meteorological Agency official, said more
eruptions are likely. Volcano researchers said another much stronger
eruption could send ash and stones over Ito.
   The meteorological agency said there were more than 100 new
tremors Saturday in Ito, a city of 72,000 residents 60 miles
southwest of Tokyo. Most tremors were too weak to be felt by humans.
   Since June 30, more than 22,800 earthquakes, including nearly 600
strong enough to be felt by people, have been recorded in the area.
   Veterinarians said that over the last two weeks, they have
treated 65 dogs and cats for disorders caused by the quakes, Kyodo
News Service said. It did not explain what disorders the animals
suffered.
   The tremors and eruption, and the threat of more to come, have
dealt a serious blow to Ito's main industry, tourism. Hotel
operators say virtually all reservations have been canceled for the
next several weeks.
   At Ito Station on Saturday morning, no tourists were seen
arriving on the special express trains from Tokyo, which ordinarily
are packed with a weekend exodus of city dwellers.
   Officials said more than 11,000 of 12,000 visitors expected over
the weekend had canceled their hotel reservations and most of the
remaining visitors were journalists covering the volcanic eruption.
   All but about a dozen of the resort's 550 hotels and inns closed
their doors because ``no one is coming,'' said a doorman at a
beachside hotel.
   Mitsuteru Miyazawa, the city's deputy mayor, said all public
schools would be closed at least until Wednesday as a precaution.
   On Thursday, about 200 people left their seaside homes after the
eruption to spend the night in Buddhist temples and schools. But
most citizens remained in their homes on Saturday, Miyazawa said.
   The Japanese archipelago, which was created by volcanic activity,
is believed to have about 80 active volcanoes. In January, Mount
Tokachi, on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, erupted several
times.

   Space shuttle Columbia moved to the
launch pad Saturday as workers got set to celebrate the 20th
anniversary of the liftoff of another spaceship with the same name,
the one that carried the first men to the moon.
   The shuttle completed a seven-hour trip to launch pad 39B shortly
before 5 a.m., and engineers and technicians began readying it for
an early August flight with five astronauts who are to release a
secret military spy satellite. Meanwhile, others made preparations
for Sunday's commemoration of the flight of the first Columbia.
   It was July 16, 1969, that an Apollo command module Columbia
blasted away from the Kennedy Space Center here with astronauts Neil
Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin and Michael Collins. Four days
later, Armstrong and Aldrin climbed into the lunar landing vehicle
Eagle and descended to the moon.
   After an historic 22 hours on the surface, the moonwalkers
rejoined Collins in mother ship Columbia for the three-day trip home.
   The three were at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala., on Saturday for a ceremony there before coming here here to
join with thousands Sunday in remembering the launch of the Apollo
11 mission.
   Outside the giant shuttle assembly building, where Apollo's
Saturn 5 rockets once were put together, the former astronauts will
make brief remarks and listen to a tape recording of the final
minutes of their countdown.
   The ``taped liftoff'' will occur at 9:32 a.m. Sunday, precisely
the time they left Earth.
   As the shuttle Columbia moved to the pad, shuttle launch director
Bob Sieck looked back at its namesake.
   ``Twenty years ago there was another spaceship, also called
Columbia, and it was out at the pad,'' he said. ``It had an
important mission and an important payload. This parallels it.
Shuttle Columbia also has an important mission and an important
payload.
   ``It also will prove we have three orbiters, and that is
significant,'' Sieck said.
   Columbia will be making its first flight since the Challenger
explosion 3{ years ago. The other two shuttles, Discovery and
Atlantis, each have been launched twice since flights resumed last
September.
   After the ceremony here Sunday morning, Armstrong, Aldrin and
Collins will ride 20 miles in a motorcade to Cocoa Beach, where they
will be honored at a luncheon. On Thursday, the 20th anniversary of
the moon landing, the trio will join President Bush for a ceremony
at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.
   NASA earlier had set July 31 as the date for launching shuttle
Columbia. But agency officials said Thursday that preparations were
behind schedule and that a liftoff now is expected during the first
week in August. A firm launch date will be set July 26 following a
two-day meeting called a flight readiness review.
   Columbia's all-military crew is to deploy a classified Defense
Department payload believed to be an advanced reconnaissance
satellite.
   While the counterparts from 1969 are being honored, the shuttle
astronauts will fly here Sunday from Houston, in preparation for
some practice sessions Monday and Tuesday.
   The crew is commanded by Air Force Col. Brewster H. Shaw Jr. The
others are Navy Cmdr. Richard N. Richards, Navy Cmdr. David C.
Leestma, Air Force Lt. Col. James C. Adamson and Air Force Maj. Mark
N. Brown.

<HEAD>Chaos as Thousands Pack Venice for Pink Floyd Concert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 50,000 people poured into the
city of canals Saturday for a free concert by the rock group Pink
Floyd, set to perform on a floating stage near St. Mark's Square.
   By early Saturday morning, 12 hours before the concert was
scheduled to begin, alleyways were packed and police were trying to
regulate the flow of people in this city of 83,000.
   The situation was exacerbated by a 24-hour transport strike that
caused chaos for inhabitants and tourists alike. An emergency
service linking up the islands, however, was in operation.
   The rail authorities issued a strong warning, telling people to
stay away from Venice with the influx of rock fans exceeding all
predictions.
   Many people spent Friday night sleeping outside the rail station
or near St Mark's Square. On Saturday the square was transformed
into a kind of sunbathing area as young people, wearing bikinis and
swimming shorts, took advantage of the sunshine while waiting for
the concert to begin.
   The concert was surrounded by controversy from the outset, with
residents and officials concerned that the loud music could damage
the city's historic buildings.
   Permission to go ahead with concert was only given Thursday after
the British group agreed to keep the volume down and organizers
agreed to move the floating stage farther from St. Mark's Square
than originally planned.

<HEAD>Director of Left-Wing Hong Kong Paper Fired By Beijing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a heavy-handed attempt to exert communist
control over a Hong Kong newspaper, China on Saturday fired the
publisher of a pro-Beijing paper that had criticized the crackdown
on student-led demonstrators in Beijing.
   The publisher of the Chinese-backed Wen Wei Po newspaper, Lee
Tze-chung, called the dismissal ``illegal'' and said he would fight
to stay at the post.
   The Communist government, acting through its official Xinhua News
Agency, replaced Lee with Chen Bojian, a former Xinhua executive who
had been working at the paper about two years.
   A day earlier, Lee had tried to fire Chen for his attempts to
stop the paper from criticizing the June 3-4 military assault on the
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   A source close to the 78-year-old Lee said he planned to go to
court to challenge the action.
   Zhang Junsheng, vice-director of Xinhua in Hong Kong, announced
Lee's dismissal after an all-night meeting of the paper's editorial
board, which Lee did not attend.
   He said Lee's firing was legal because Wen Wei Po was ``backed by
Chinese investment'' and therefore Xinhua had the right to ``manage
the newspaper.'' China gives the paper an estimated $1.3 million a
year and Chinese companies hold the bulk of its stock.
   Zhang cited a 4-year-old resignation letter written by Lee as
evidence of the legality of the dismissal.
   ``Now, we have decided to accept his resignation,'' he said.
   Lee's dismissal marks the latest in a series of attempts by
Beijing to reassert its control over left-wing publications in Hong
Kong and extend the current ideological campaign to this British
colony, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   After the military crackdown in Beijing, China lost all support
from Chinese-language magazines and papers in Hong Kong.
   Lee's newspaper changed its masthead from red to black in
mourning.
   ``Today, I can't be an accomplice to the murderers anymore,'' Lee
said in a television interview after the military assault.
   The statement marked the first time since the paper was founded
in 1948 that it had broken with the Communist Party.
   Support from the Hong Kong media is important for China because
many Hong Kong papers set the tone for public opinion in Chinese
communities worldwide. Many also are smuggled into China.
   Since the crackdown began, Chinese officials have repeatedly told
Hong Kong residents not to ``interfere'' in China's domestic affairs
by publishing critical accounts of the crackdown or helping the
movement for democratic reforms.
   Wen Wei Po continued to refer to Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping
and Li Peng as ``a gang of thieves.'' Lee had also reportedly been
exploring a plan to allow the paper to become independent from
Communist control.
   A group of American Chinese have formed an organization, Friends
of the Wen Wei Po, to raise funds for the paper.
   On Thursday, Lee and Chen battled over an article on the group.
Chen won out as Wen Wei Po published a report criticizing the
organization.
   In his statement, Lee blasted Chen's story, calling it ``nothing
but wanton insults.''
   Several editors of Hong Kong publications said Xinhua's actions
were disturbing because they constituted an infringement on a free
press.
   Hong Kong will return to Chinese rule in 1997 and China has
promised to keep the colony's free-wheeling social and capitalist
economic system intact for 50 years.
   ``But this type of action shows that it's all a farce,'' said Lee
Yi, publisher of The Nineties, an influential Chinese-language
magazine. ``We have a choice: Either report the news or become
Beijing's mouthpiece. Those of us who report the news had best get
out of town.''

<HEAD>Strike by Technicians Delays Flights Across Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strike by French air traffic control technicians
disrupted flight schedules Saturday throughout much of Western
Europe, causing delays of up to 10 hours on some flights, officials
said.
   Civil aviation officials at Orly Airport in Paris said the strike
by technicians, who maintain radars and other electronic equipment
used for takeoffs and landings, was scheduled to last until Monday.
It began Tuesday.
   Controllers were ordered to increase spacing between flights as a
safety measure.
   The domestic airline Air Inter predicted delays on about 30 of
its 240 flights Saturday, and the backups disrupted flights
elsewhere in Europe.
   The technicians are seeking increased staffing and changes in
career promotion ladders to match those of air traffic controllers.
   The Transport Ministry said technicians should be satisfied with
results of negotiations in October, which it said resulted in an
agreement giving them ``advantages comparable to those of the other
categories'' of air traffic control employees.
   In London, the Civil Aviation Authority said French controllers
had cut the number of British flights handled from 54 to a half
dozen per hour, and British air traffic controllers were offering to
reroute some flights.
   The dispute delayed British flights to Spain, Portugal and North
Africa by up to 5{ hours. Flights to and from Italy also were
affected.
   The Spanish flag carrier Iberia canceled 16 flights to and from
European countries, and flights out of the resort island of Palma
were delayed up to 10 hours, said a Spanish air official.
   The French Transport Ministry issued a statement saying ``maximal
conditions of safety are still being fulfilled'' even though
controllers were not able to use some equipment normally used to
track flights.

   To friends and acquaintances, lobbyist Craig J.
Spence was an enigma: They couldn't figure out whether he was a
character out of a James Bond movie or a businessman living a Walter
Mitty fantasy.
   Those who attended Spence's star-studded parties or accepted his
money said they viewed his peculiarities _ like traveling with a
gaggle of security guards and communicating by walkie-talkie _ as
the props of a man on the move, Washington-style.
   ``He looked like a riverboat gambler, he was a bachelor and very
wealthy and always looking for business, but that seemed like such a
common thing in Washington,'' said former Ambassador Robert Neumann.
   Spence once arranged for Neumann, who was ambassador to Saudi
Arabia and several other countries, to travel on an expenses-paid
trip with his wife to Japan.
   The 48-year-old Spence is the most prominent of several men
identified in the investigation of a Washington callboy ring.
   The Washington Times, citing credit card records, reported late
last month that Spence had paid as much as $20,000 in a month to a
male prostitution ring that was raided earlier this year by police.
The paper quoted unidentified male prostitutes and others as saying
Spence had bugged his own house, where the lobbyist threw lavish
parties for the Washington elite.
   Since then, Spence seems to be just about the only person in
Washington who isn't talking about the story. Repeated telephone
calls to his home have gone unanswered.
   The mysterious Spence cut a wide social and business swath
through Washington, and the breadth of his circle of acquaintances
made the story all the more titillating. Everyone is reading The
Washington Times to find out whose name pops up next, said prominent
political consultant Vic Kamber.
   According to the Times, police obtained credit card slips
implicating Spence, as well as many lesser-known Washingtonians, in
raids on so-called escort services with names such as ``Dream Boys''
and ``Man to Man.''
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens says he is investigating the
prostitution ring, which operated out of a two-story brick house in
a prosperous neighborhood, for possible credit card fraud, a
white-collar crime that falls under the purview of the Secret
Service.
   The Secret Service, which is charged with guarding the White
House and protecting foreign embassies, also is examining whether
one of its uniformed guards violated policy by giving Spence and
several friends a late-night White House tour on July 3, 1988.
   Officer Reginald deGueldre, a former White House guard, has been
placed on administrative leave. He acknowledged in an interview with
The Associated Press that he led a Spence group on a private tour of
the White House ``just like I did my family.'' He also told the
Times that Spence gave him an $8,000 gold Rolex watch.
   The Baltimore Sun, citing anonymous sources, reported in
Saturday's editions that a separate apartment Spence rented was
searched by Secret Service officers the night after deGueldre's home
was searched.
   Richard Adams, a Secret Service spokesman, refused to confirm or
deny that Spence's apartment had been searched when contacted
Saturday by The Associated Press.
   The Washington Times contends the call boy ring's clients
included ``key officials of the Reagan and Bush administrations.''
It has identified several mid-level officials by name.
   Paul Balach resigned as a political personnel aide to Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole when the story appeared. Charles K.
Dutcher, a former associate personnel officer at the Reagan White
House, told the Times he used the service once, paying $155 for one
session with a male prostitute.
   The newspaper also named Stanley Tapscott, another former Reagan
personnel officer. Tapscott, who had become a Times editor, resigned
from the paper but denied patronizing the ring.
   But it is Spence, who did not hold public office, who has
attracted most of the attention. What has emerged about him in
recent days is a picture of a man who propelled himself into the
social limelight by spending money often supplied by Japanese
interests to cultivate academics, ambassadors, journalists, members
of Congress, military officers and other habitues of the corridors
of power.
   Among those who attended Spence's gatherings were journalists
Eric Severeid and Liz Trotta; James Lilley, the U.S. ambassador to
China; William Safire, a columnist for The New York Times; and
former CIA Director William Casey, according to other guests and the
Times.
   Much of the money that oiled Spence's social machine came from
Japan, according to records he filed under the Foreign Agents
Registration Act. For example, in a five-month period in 1981, the
Policy Study Group of Tokyo gave Spence $110,000. The non-profit
group was financed by Japanese business interests and affiliated
with a faction of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
   Some of those who accepted Spence's hospitality said they did so
because they believed he could open doors to lucrative markets in
the Orient.
   ``He was eccentric but he was extremely well-informed,'' said
former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova, now a private attorney who
once went on a business trip to Japan with Spence.
   It was ``sort of a salon'' he was running there, said veteran
journalist Sarah McClendon, who said Spence paid her $400 to write a
profile of a political figure. McClendon said she refused to do any
more work for Spence when she learned he was being paid by the
Japanese.
   ``Obviously the Japanese were using him to get as much
information as they could about the personal habits of public
officials,'' McClendon said. ``To my notion, that borders on
espionage.''
   Spence ceased operating as an agent for Japan in late 1987,
documents show, and recently he seemed to have lowered his profile.
Neumann said he attended a small dinner party Spence hosted a few
months ago, but, unlike previous Spence soirees, there was no
``special guest.''
   Richard Gordon, a Georgetown University law professor who
considers Spence a friend, said Spence had been sick, but the nature
of his illness was not revealed.
   Some of Spence's one-time associates say they are aghast at
stories about his alleged double life.
   Gordon said he has been ``shocked and utterly repelled'' by what
he's read about Spence. He said Spence's glittering parties and
highbrow seminars had ``zero to do with this sex thing.''
   Gordon said Spence seemed to enjoy portraying himself as a
character shrouded in mystery. With Spence, there was ``always this
invited suspicion that he was really an agent. He seemed to enjoy
that,'' he said.
   ``He was a tremendous name-dropper and had a tremendous ego,''
said Kamber, who was paid $400 for speaking at one of the seminars
that Spence arranged on political and economic issues.
   Kamber, well known in Democratic circles, said he assumed Spence
courted him because he provided a counterpoint to conservative
speakers. Before he was hired to speak at Spence's seminars, Kamber
said, he was ``looked over'' by Spence at a private luncheon.
   ``I guess he wanted to see if I had the social graces ... if I
knew how to use a knife and fork,'' Kamber said.
   While the Spence story has titillated the nation's capital, it
has not amused the organized gay and lesbian community.
   ``The Washington Times story is a rank attempt to sensationalize
a fact that should come as no surprise to anybody: that there are
gay people in the Republican Party and in this Republican
administration,'' said the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

   Syrian and Christian gunners battled with
howitzers and mortars around the capital Saturday as rival Shiite
Moslem militias fought in the alleyways of the city's southern slums.
   The state electricity authority declared a power blackout in
Beirut and in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the
city Saturday after it ran out of fuel for its main generating plant
in Christian east Beirut.
   Police said one person was killed and at least 19 people were
wounded in the artillery duels.
   That raised the casualty toll from the 17-week confrontation
between Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's forces and the
Syrians to 417 killed and 1,646 wounded.
   Police said the Syrian-Christian artillery duels intensified in
the afternoon as shells rained on Beirut's Moslem and Christian
sections.
   ``It has been almost two months since we were pounded with such
intensity,'' said a resident of the Christian district of Sen El-Fil.
   Forty rockets hit the neighborhood simultaneously, he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Police also reported machine-gun and mortar clashes across
Beirut's dividing Green Line and in the mountains southeast of the
capital.
   A police spokesman said one person was killed and four were
wounded in a four-hour firefight between the pro-Syrian Amal militia
and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The rival factions battled with automatic weapons and
rocket-propelled grenades in the narrow alleys of south Beirut.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
said the fighting ended when Syrian troops intervened at 4 a.m.
   By police count, 561 people have been killed and 1,554 wounded
since Amal and Hezbollah began fighting in Beirut and south Lebanon
last April for dominance of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites.
   The police spokesman said Syrian howitzers deployed in Moslem
west Beirut shelled a 28-mile stretch of the Christian coastline
north of Beirut and key positions manned by Aoun's army in the
mountains overlooking Beirut.
   He said shells fell around the ports of Jounieh and Byblos and
the Christian towns of Hadath and Kfar Sheema on the southeastern
edge of the war-divided capital.
   Smoke billowed from the wooded slopes that overlook Beirut as the
sound of exploding shells echoed across the battered city.
   Aoun's gunners responded by shelling the Syrian batteries along
the main seaside boulevard in west Beirut and Syrian positions in
the Druse Moslem villages of Shweifat and Aitat, the spokesman said.
   The Syrians shell the coastline north of Beirut daily to enforce
a blockade of Christian ports and prevent Aoun from receiving
shipments of war material and other supplies.
   The blockade has caused a serious fuel shortage in the Christian
sector, where some 1 million people are trapped.
   The electricity authority said it will continue to provide power
to water pumping stations, hospitals and communications centers for
two hours a day.
   The fighting between the Syrians and Aoun's forces broke out
March 8, two days after Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by
Syrian-backed Moslem militias south of Beirut.
   He charged that the militia ports robbed the badly depleted state
treasury of about $100 million a year in lost customs fees.
   The Syrians, who back Moslems demanding an equal share of power
with the traditionally dominant Christians, responded by besieging
the Christian enclave.

   The number of pigeons in this gambling capital
will likely decrease soon, but it has nothing to do with changing
casino odds.
   The Nevada Department of Wildlife has introduced four
pigeon-eating peregrine falcons in the urban jungle, roosting
comfortably on the top of the Las Vegas Hilton hotel-casino.
   The endangered birds of prey, now about 40 days old, were hatched
in Reno and flown to Las Vegas where they took up residence 300 feet
above the ground on July 5.
   ``It might sound like some silly publicity stunt, but actually
the Hilton is a tremendous man-made cliff that very much resembles
what might be found in a natural environment for these birds,''
Wildlife Department spokesman Geoff Schneider said Friday.
   ``A second advantage is there's lots of prey around _ domestic
pigeons, grackles (birds with long tails) ... and there are no real
predators to eat them. They've even got overhangs for shade on the
building.''
   ``We want to do this every year until we have a pair that will
come back to nest there,'' Schneider said. ``We're trying everything
to save this species which is making a comeback after almost
becoming extinct.''
   The hotel built a box on its roof to serve as a home for the
birds and installed video cameraas so guests below can watch the
falcons on their in-room television sets.

   The glamorous and grimy private eye of
detective novels and mystery movies doesn't exist, according to an
organization of investigators who say they're no Sam Spades or Jim
Rockfords.
   ``The private investigator has always had the image of a
carefree, devil-may-care individual, someone who sometimes skirts
the law,'' said Alan Crowe, an investigator from Portland, Ore.
   But that image doesn't stick to a private eye's trenchcoat, or
whatever kind of coat they wear chasing down the mundane details
they say make up the bulk of their work.
   ``People think we're a bunch of ex-police officers,'' said Kitty
Robinson, an investigator from Haddonfield, N.J., ``with a brush
cut, a pot belly, a double-knit polyester suit with two rows of
white stripes in a green background, and chafe marks under the left
arm to show people we've been wearing a gun.''
   Robinson and Crowe are among 225 members of the National
Convention of Legal Investigators meeting this weekend in
Philadelphia to network, attend seminars and conduct testing for a
continuing program of certification.
   ``A private investigator is an average person who's a
professional,'' Robinson said. ``More likely than not, they're the
cerebral type. Look around. This could be a group of computer people
or sales people.''
   Most of their work is too tedious to make a best-seller, the
investigators said.
   ``It's not glamourous,'' Robinson said. ``You get dirty, you work
long hours, it's tedious, you actually have to read, volumes and
volumes of depositions.''

   The brother-in-law of Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez was kidnapped Saturday near the
Venezuela-Colombia border, the RCN radio network reported.
   The radio said Norbeto Rodriguez was seized by a group of armed
men at a ranch on the Colombian side of the border early Saturday.
The report did not say whose ranch it was.
   Rodriguez is the brother of Blanca Rodriguez, the wife of the
Venezuelan president.
   The radio did not identify the group that kidnapped Rodriguez.
However, the leftist National Liberation Army guerrilla group
operates in the area in which he was seized.
   The guerrillas have been waging a war of sabotage and terrorism
and are blamed for kidnapping dozens of politicians and journalists.

<HEAD>Soviet President Says Perestroika Linked to World Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in a
letter Saturday to the economic summit in Paris that his policy of
perestroika, or restructuring, is linked closely to the Soviet
Union's participation in the world economy.
   Gorbachev said the world's other countries clearly have a stake
in the Soviet reforms.
   It ``is obvious that the rest of the world can only gain by the
opening to the world economy of a market such as that of the Soviet
Union,'' Gorbachev wrote in a letter to French President Francois
Mitterrand.
   Mitterrand is presiding over the 15th annual economic summit of
the West's seven richest industrial democracies.
   ``Our perestroika is inseparable from the policy tending toward
full and entire participation in the world economy,'' Gorbachev
wrote.
   Gorbachev has instituted a broad array of economic and social
reforms since taking power in March 1985. However, his reform
movement has done more to improve personal freedom for the Soviets
than to achieve any visible change in economic performance.
   The Soviet president said the traditional way for resolving
economic imbalances between states was on the basis of strictly
national interests.
   ``However, today such a balance would be precarious if one tried
to base it on anything other than the universal interests of
humanity,'' Gorbachev wrote in the letter, made available to the
press by Mitterrand's spokesman, Hubert Vedrine.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said Bush and the
other leaders had not had a chance to analyze the letter in any
detail ``except to say we generally found it positive and
supportive.''
   Fitzwater said there was no lengthy discussion of the message.
   Gorbachev said it is clear that common economic interests can
serve as the basis for cooperation, and the proof of that is the
increasing number of bilateral agreements between the Soviet Union
and Western countries.
   ``However, multilateral East-West cooperation on global economic
problems are manifestly far behind compared to the development of
bilateral and regional links,'' he said.
   ``This state of things does not seem justified in light of the
weight of our states in the world economy, of the responsibility
that is ours in the rational and efficient functioning of it for the
good of all people and the world community in general.''
   One of the key issues before the three-day summit here involving
the United States, France, West German, Britain, Canada, Italy and
Japan is dealing with the $1.3 trillion in debt built up by the
Third World. Gorbachev suggested constructive cooperation in
resolving the problem.
   ``We see points of convergence and complementarity in the
approaches to global problems, in particular the solution to Third
World debt,'' the Soviet president said. ``It doesn't matter who
gets credit for the best initiative.''
   He said old, artificial obstacles between different economic
systems were being torn down. It is urgent, he added, ``to get
together on the methodology and harmonization of the economic
process.''
   ``We are ready to engage in a constructive dialogue on these
questions,'' the Soviet president said.
   The important thing, he said, ``is to find the beginning of a
common economic language, to proceed to a reciprocal exchange of
information.''

   Santa Claus came to town Saturday,
but instead of carrying a sack of toys, he showed up with a job
complaint.
   About 30 people wearing Saint Nick costumes marched through
downtown Hamburg to demand that the city of 1.6 million celebrate a
second Christmas each July 24 so Santa can earn more money.
   The jolly marchers sang Christmas songs and carried signs reading
``A Second Christmas for the Children'' and ``One is Not Enough.''
   The demonstrators said they belong to a local ``Father Christmas
Union.'' Father Christmas is West Germany's Santa Claus. They did
not say why they chose July 24 as the date for a second Christmas.
   ``Many of our members are students and retirees who would be
happy to have a second Father Christmas job during the year, simply
because they need the money,'' said a leaflet handed out by the
group.
   The Saint Nicks have some highly influential support.
   ``They are backed by the real Father Christmas himself,'' the
leaflet declared.
   The Saint Nicks behaved themselves during their march, police
said.
   City officials did not comment on their demands.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While leaders of the world's seven richest nations
met behind closed doors Saturday, representatives of the seven
``poorest peoples'' held a public meeting across town on the Left
Bank.
   Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Mozambique, the Philippines,
Zaire and the Brazilian Amazon were represented by doctors, poets,
women's and human rights activists, labor leaders and ethnic
emissaries.
   Orlando Melgueiros da Silva, bare-chested and in a feather
headdress, represented Brazil's Union of Indigenous Nations.
   The meeting of the Seven Poorest Peoples occurred under the
auspices of The Other Economic Summit, an annual conference
searching for alternative solutions at the same time the leaders of
the United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada are meeting.
   ``We seek an alternative economic development which will do away
with social injustice, the north's domination of Third World
countries and the thoughtless pillage of the earth's resources,''
explained the conference paper.
   More than 1,000 participants attended the meeting.
   A final declaration issued Saturday night called for a ``radical
transformation of the international political and economic system''
to make sure decisions were not taken just by the rich countries,
but ``with all the peoples of the world.''
   The statement also called for a ban on the use of international
loans for arms purchases, for controls on ``destructive energy
consumption'' and forgiveness of the debt owed by poor countries to
the rich.
   The summit, held alongside the seven-nation economic summit, or
G-7, every year since 1974, included such seminars as ``Education
for the Third Millenium'' and ``Without Arms, Citizens?'' which
explored the role of private citizens in the peace process and
disarmament.
   Like the leaders across town, the alternative summiteers also
discussed international debt, economics and the environment.
   Konrad Von Moltke, a senior fellow with the Conservation
Foundation and the World Wide Fund for Nature in Washington D.C.,
prepared a background paper on the environment for the G-7 summit
but dropped in at the alternative summit as well.
   ``In dealing with environmental problems, the relationships are
no longer big and small, powerful and weak nations, because we are
all interdependent,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tanker Damaged in Indian Ocean Collision Leaks Oil Off U.A.E.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tanker spilled more than
1.6 million gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean
and has been turned away from three ports since a collision last
month, shipping sources said Saturday.
   A 60-mile-long oil slick was heading toward the Indian coast,
said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Maltese-flagged 32,000-ton Puppy was anchored Saturday in
international waters off Khor Fakkan, and several tugboats were to
be sent to transfer the oil from the leaking tanks, the sources said.
   Khor Fakkan, a Persian Gulf port 200 miles south of Abu Dhabi,
refused to permit the Puppy into port because of the leak.
   The June 28 collision occurred in the Indian Ocean between the
Puppy, managed by the Geneva-based Acomarit Services Maritimes, and
the 24,597-ton bulk carrier Quince, managed by a Hong Kong-based
firm.
   The accident, about 700 miles southwest of Bombay, ruptured two
cargo tanks aboard the Puppy, which was on its way from Egypt with a
load of crude oil for Singapore.
   After the accident, Bombay refused to let the Puppy dock because
of the leaking oil.
   Meanwhile, the tanker spilled 1.2 million gallons into the Indian
Ocean, creating a slick more than 60 miles long and 12 miles wide,
the sources said.
   Sea currents were pushing the slick toward India's Kerala coast,
and it was expected to reach there within 10 days.
   The tanker, pulled by a tugboat, headed for Khor Fakkan and
Fujairah, another United Arab Emirates port, but was told to stay
off the coast and wait for help.
   Capt. Roger Saunders, Fujairah's port director, said the tanker
was ``diverted to international waters'' five days ago and anchored
about 50 miles off Khor Fakkan.
   ``The delay in the ... transfer of the oil ... has increased the
danger of the oil slick growing,'' one source said. ``A thin oil
slick was noticed when the stricken vessel anchored five days ago.''

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush, her wish fulfilled, had lunch at a
17th century chateau Saturday after touring a U.S. crafts exhibit
that made her ``proud to be an American.''
   As President Bush tended to matter of state at the 15th annual
economic summit, the first lady set off on her own.
   Mrs. Bush toured several rooms of the 17th chateau owned by the
Marquis and Marquise Jean-Louis de Ganay.
   ``Look at this, isn't it beautiful?'' marvelled Mrs. Bush as she
emerged in the blazing sunshine to tour the vast gardens with their
spring-fed ponds, laid out in the 17th century by the landscapist
Lenotre, who designed the Versailles gardens for Louis XIV.
   ``I want you to get used to me here,'' Mrs. Bush joked with her
host and hostess, the Marquis and Marquise Jean-Louis de Ganay.
   Joining Mrs. Bush on the tour were Susan Baker and Kitty Brady,
wives of the secretaries of state and treasury.
   ``Mrs. Bush wanted to see a chateau and pretty garden,'' said
Sondra Daley, a spokesman for the first lady.
   The choice was made by Ambassador Walter Curley and his wife, who
know the de Ganay family.
   Like many aristocratic owners, the de Ganays allow visitors to
pay admission to tour the chateau at certain times to defray
maintenance costs.
   Strolling around the gardens, Mrs. Bush called to two dogs to
pose with her for a picture. ``Come on you two dogs, they want us in
the center,'' she said.
   Referring to her own pet, she added, ``I hope Millie will take
note and not be jealous. She'll eat her heart out.''
   Earlier Saturday, Mrs. Bush toured the ``Craft USA Today'' show
at the Decorative Arts branch of the Louvre museum, where the work
of 183 American artisans, ranging from patchwork quilts to a ceramic
briefcase, is displayed.
   ``It makes you proud to be an American,'' she said.
   She looked at her watch to see if a wooden clock called ``Time to
Say Goodbye'' by Wendell Castle was keeping time. A museum spokesman
said it had not been wound.
   ``I love that,'' she said of an enormous tulipwood spheroid by
Edward Moulthrop.
   ``That's amazing,'' she said of a multicolored glass creation by
Dale Chihuly. ``One man blowing that. It's beautiful.''
   When someone asked if she would like it for her Maine vacation
house, she said, ``No, it's too grand for Kennebunkport.''
   Mrs. Bush posed holding hands with a glazed clay 10-foot-high
statue of a man splashed with garish colors by Viola Frey.
   ``It's just like in Washington, when you get your picture taken
with the president _ or the first lady,'' referring to the cardboard
photo setups popular with tourists outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

<HEAD>New Economy Minister Takes Over; Pledges To Continue Austerity Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Businessman Nestor Rapanelli was
sworn in Saturday as the fifth economy minister in 3{ months, and he
pledged to complete the austerity program of Miguel Roig, who died
only six days after taking office.
   Rapanelli, 60, took his oath of office from President Carlos
Menem in the same Government House room where an all-night wake was
held for Roig, whose death of a heart attack Friday shook the
beleaguered South American nation.
   The new minister said he would ``continue the policies of Roig''
in an effort to halt hyperinflation, end Argentina's worst recession
in 173 years and stop the widespread hunger that produced food riots
in May.
   A voluntary price accord with businesses that would allow the
government to coordinate wage increases ``will be signed on Monday
or Tuesday,'' Rapanelli told reporters.
   Roig, 68, had been negotiating the agreement at the time of his
death.
   In choosing Rapanelli, Menem turned again to the giant Bunge and
Born grain conglomerate, where the new minister served as vice
president, as had Roig until his retirement three years ago.
   Rapanelli ``is the right man to maintain our economic program,''
said Menem as he joined Roig's family, friends and other officials
at the wake.
   Rapanelli has worked for Bunge and Born for 39 years. He also is
vice president of the Institute for Executive Development in
Argentina and is a director of the Foundation for Latin American
Economic Investigation.
   He faces a formidable task in continuing the program outlined by
Roig, who was sworn in July 8 following Menem's inauguration.
   Roig on Sunday announced a 54 percent devaluation of the austral
and raised state-controlled utility prices by at least 200 percent.
   The currency held firm against the dollar, which Argentines use
as a hedge against inflation, during the first three days of the
week.
   But on Thursday, the dollar's value on the black market soared
above 700 australs, compared to the official rate of 650, following
a series of rumors, including one that Roig might resign.
   Inflation grew by 114.5 percent in June and projections for July
are 200 percent or more. Unemployment stands at about 10 percent.
Real wages have shrunk by an estimated 60 percent.
   The economic crisis led to food riots in late May that claimed at
least 14 lives.
   Thousands of Argentines now receive daily meals at soup kitchens
that were set up last month. Menem has estimated that 9 million of
the country's 30 million inhabitants are ``living at the edge of
misery.''
   On Saturday, the government sent 140 tons of food to the northern
provinces of Chaco and Tucuman for distribution among the needy.
   Rapanelli is the nation's fifth economy minister since March 31,
the day Juan Sourrouille resigned after failing to stabilize the
economy.
   Two other ministers, Juan Carlos Pugliese and then Jesus
Rodriguez, also failed to implement economic reforms under former
President Raul Alfonsin, whose Radical Civic Union lost the May 14
elections to Menem's Peronist Party.
   Roig was not a Peronist _ nor is Rapanelli _ and his appointment
added substance to Menem's claims that his administration would be
non-partisan.
   Roig, described by associates as a seven-pack-a-day cigarette
smoker, is survived by his wife, two sons and four grandchildren.

<HEAD>Government Bans Sale Of Dioxin-Tainted Milk And Meat Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has banned the sale
of milk and meat products from farms near two large waste
incinerators after foodstuffs from the farms were found to be
contaminated by dioxin.
   The decision was announced in a letter to Parliament late Friday
and followed tests showing that the milk contained three times the
amount of dioxin considered normal, according to George Dankmeyer, a
Heath Ministry spokesman.
   The official described the measures as ``precautionary'' and said
there was no immediate danger to public health.
   However, Dankmeyer added that consumers drinking the contaminated
milk on a daily basis would ultimately take in more dioxin than is
considered safe, he said.
   The government also ordered the waste furnaces to take stricter
anti-pollution measures and was considering suing them for damages,
he said.
   Dioxin is a highly toxic chemical contaminant that can be
released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of waste combustion. It
has been used in chemical warfare.
   At issue is the milk and meat produce of 16 dairy farms
surrounding the Rijnmond Waste Disposal Center near Rotterdam, the
nation's largest combustion furnace for domestic waste.
   The annual milk output of those farms is about 1 million gallons
but there was no immediate word how much of the tainted milk had
been sold or over what period.
   The government announced similar measures for farms in the area
of a waste furnace near Amsterdam after theoretical calculations
showed the same level of dioxin pollution was likely there,
Dankmeyer said.
   Tests on produce from the Amsterdam site still need to be
completed, he said, adding that 10 similar combustion furnaces
elsewhere in the country were believed safe.
   Milk from the two sites will be taken to a specially designated
dairy factory, where the milkfat, in which dioxin accumulates, will
be skimmed off and destroyed. The remainder will be converted into
powdered milk, Dankmeyer said.
   Meat originating from any of the stricken farms will also be
destroyed, said Dankmeyer, adding that farmers will be fully
compensated.

<HEAD>Summit, Bicentennial Draw Media Hordes to Paris</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slung with I.D. tags and touting lenses worth more
than the per capita income of poorer countries, 6,000 journalists
descended on Paris to report on the summit of the world's seven
richest nations and revel in the glamour of the French bicentennial
celebrations.
   The summit and the media circus moved into the barely-completed
Arche de La Defense, the glittering 35-story cube that crowns the La
Defense business district on Paris' western edge.
   Camera crews relished the panorama from the 54-step climb to the
marble base of the Arche, a structure that forced writers to dust
off their architectural vocabulary: the consensus settled on
``post-modernist.''
   Close-mouthed about the cost, the French have splashed out the
hospitality for the more than 30 heads of state and the journalists
who traced their every move. Open bars and four 500-seat tented
pavillions at the Arche offered 23,000 lavish meals to ravenous
reporters during the summit weekend.
   The timing of the summit _ after President Bush's Eastern
European tour _ and the bicentennial festivities have brought out
the media stars.
   ABC's Peter Jennings, CBS's Dan Rather and NBC's Tom Brokaw all
broadcast from famous Parisian sites.
   The festivities and the summit stretched logistics organizers to
the limit.
   ``Each time we try to do smarter and better with less people,''
says Lloyd Siegel of NBC, which has a team of about 50 on the
mission. Like other media organizations, NBC has added staff but
mainly to handle the bicentennial side or the economic issues.
   The military parades, dance extravaganzas and the fireworks
bursting over the summer crowds have provided a colorful finish to
Bush's headline-grabbing swing through Poland and Hungary.
   ABC network originated its Business World show from here.
   ABC's Good Morning America also broadcast a special on the
bicentennial from Notre Dame cathedral, while NBC originated Today
from the Quai de Tournelle.
   Each of the three major networks lined up top Bush adminstration
officials for its Sunday morning talk shows _ Secretary of State
James A. Baker III on ABC, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft
on CBS and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu on NBC.
   For a crew from Japan Broadcasting Corporation, the two events
complement each other.
   ``What President (Francois) Mitterrand was trying to do involving
the summit in the bicentennial makes it more festive,'' said Takemi
Shiga. ``But I think if the summit was not held in Paris the
bicentennial would not be so much reported.''
   Some reporters grumbled about the readiness of the French for the
media hordes.
   Crews cited delayed accreditation, the half-finished state of the
Arche, which lead to power cuts and communications problems, the
endless security checks and the travel arrangements between assorted
press centers and hotels.
   Reporters traveling in the U.S. presidential motorcade got
separated from the Bush limousine more than once, while other groups
followed the president for seven-hour stretches without even seeing
him.
   But the White House press room, esconced in the Meridien Hotel,
has allowed journalists from other countries and non-U.S. agencies
to join expanded travel pools.
   ``The problems we have had here are unavoidable,'' said a French
journalist who did not want to be named. ``Things would be simpler
for foreigners who spoke even a few words of French.''

   Many haute couture shops in chic districts closed
their doors in dismay at picnicking tourist crowds celebrating the
bicentennial, but restaurants, cafes and bakery shops did a brisk
business.
   Party-goers, their mouths stuffed with pastry, seemed to make a
mockery of the disdainful Revolutionary era remark about letting the
hungry mob eat cake.
   But by the wee hours of the morning Saturday, when one famished
reporter was looking for nourishment, there was nothing to be found.
   ``Ah, Madame, we don't have a crumb of bread left to eat,'' was
the reply at one establishment.
   The French Revolution seemed to have come full circle.

   President Francois Mitterrand has been accused of favoring pomp
over the people for his lavish three-day bicentennial blast. But he
cannot be accused of nepotism.
   As the chief of state presided over the grand and mighty military
parade marking Bastille Day, his brother, retired Gen. Jacques
Mitterrand, slipped discreetly into a vacant seat in a press stand,
first wiping the dusty chair clean with a piece of paper.
   Asked his thoughts about his brother's alleged notions of
grandeur, the general begged off. ``A big subject,'' he said in
English, then added: ``I'm just a member of the public.''

   The most constant complaint during the bicentennial celebrations
has come from citizens on wheels prohibited for security reasons
from driving, or even parking, their cars in much of central Paris.
   ``The French Revolution was for the abolition of privileges,''
grumbled one taxi driver angered by the inconvenience caused by more
than two dozen visiting foreign leaders.
   ``These heads of state are nice guys and I have nothing against
them,'' he said. ``But I have the right to make a living.''
   In typical Gallic fashion, the taxi driver, eager to vent his
emotions, expounded freely on his revolutionary heritage. But also
typical, he feared identifying himself by name, saying he could lose
his job if his complaints were made known.
   Reminded that liberty and the rights of man were at the essence
of the Revolution, he gave a knowing wink. ``True. But, some people
in this country have more rights than others,'' he said.

   Eight tow trucks, all honking their horns in a victory salute,
tooled down the Boulevard Montparnasse the other night, dragging
illegally parked cars like captured prey.
   French police have been unforgiving about keeping the sealed-off
city center car-free to accomodate bicentennial festivities.
   The cars are taken to lots in the Bois de Boulogne in western
Paris and the Bois de Vincennes in the east. About 1,000 were towed
in the first 24 hours of the clearing operation. The only charge to
the car owner is the price of a taxi ride out.

   Reporters covering the summit of the leaders of the major
industrial democracies have been treated to a tantalizing array of
French food: mousses, pates, duck, roast beef, salads and tarts for
dessert. The dishes are painstakingly prepared and presented on
starched tablecloths. Fresh flowers abound.
   One day, amid the lavish culinary outlay, stood five bottles of
ketchup _ apparently an attempt by the French to appeal to all their

   Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno and President Hossain
Mohammed Ershad of Bangladesh exchanged original gifts at a
bilateral meeting in Paris this week. They gave each other books of
their own poetry.
   The 66-year-old Japanese leader, who hails from a sake-brewing
family, writes haiku in his spare time. He has published three books
of his poetry, one of which he gave to Ershad, according to Japanese
officials.
   A sample of his work was published in an official biography
handed out to foreign press at the summit. Written in May as Uno
flew across Siberia, it recalls his imprisonment in World War II in
the Soviet Union:
   ``On that prisoner's path
   ``Where I pulled a wooden sled
   ``Now the leaves of spring.''
   Ershad gave Uno a book called ``Selected Poems,'' one of four
books of poetry he has published.

   When Britain's Margaret Thatcher and Zaire's Mobutu
Sese Seko arrived to view the lavish military parade on the
Champs-Elysees marking France's bicentennial, they automatically
strode up to the front row, befitting their place as leaders of
their countries.
   Embarrassed French officials had to show them to their seats _ at
the back of the bullet-proof stand.
   The seating order, the officials explained, was dictated by
protocol.
   But how that magic formula is determined remains a mystery.
   The summit of the world's seven richest nations, the simultaneous
meeting of some two dozen Third World leaders and the celebrations
for the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution were all ruled by
protocol.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Saturday the seven were led by
France, the host nation, followed in order by the United States,
Britain, West Germany, Canada, Ialy and Japan. The spokesman said
the order was determined by the years the leader had held his office.
   Protocol placed President Bush, barely six months into his term,
ahead of the others because he, like Mitterrand, is a head of state
and not merely a head of government, like Mrs. Thatcher and the rest.
   The official could not give any motivation for the order in which
the leaders of the other 27 countries _ most of whom went home
Saturday _ were ranked.
   Protocol was invented by the French before the French Revolution
as a set of rules for the behavior of diplomats.
   As host, French President Francois Mitterrand was able to use
protocol to get his message across, putting emphasis where he felt
it was due and, perhaps, putting world leaders such as Thatcher in
their place.
   As master of ceremonies, Mitterrand was able to control events,
from how the heads of government lined up for the official
photograph to the order in which they made their getaways by
limousine.
   Mobutu, who was not invited but came anyway, is on the French
government's blacklist for his checkered human rights record.
   Wearing his trademark leopard skin cap, Mobutu strode to the
front row of every meeting, only to find he was seated
inconspicuously at the back.
   Mrs. Thatcher was booed by the French public Friday for recalling
the ``incredible terror'' of their hallowed revolution and likening
it to latter day exterminations in communist lands.
   Mrs. Thatcher had a place of honor on Mitterrand's left in the
formal group photo taken of the seven; Bush was on his right.
   ``We could not do anything else, since she was the only lady
among the leaders,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman explained.
   But at the inauguration of the new opera house at the Bastille,
Mrs. Thatcher found she had to take a back seat with Mobutu, while
Bush was in front, alongside India's Rajiv Gandhi and Brazil's Jose
Sarney.
   At Friday's military parade, the British prime minister was among
the last allowed to leave the bulletproof enclosure encircling the
leaders. Japan's Uno was also in the rear guard.
   Mitterrand and his motocycle escort left first, as is the custom
for the host.
   But the arrangements for the others had not been made clear in
advance. So, for several minutes, the leaders sat on their red
velvet chairs not daring to move for fear of _ what else? _
upsetting protocol.
   When the order of departure was finally sorted out, President
Felix Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, a leader of the
underprivileged countries, was first out of the gate, followed
swiftly by Bush.
   In the confusion, the leaders' cars got out of order and some
almost collided. President Omar Bongo of Gabon decided to return to
his hotel on foot.
   Mitterrand was unable to win approval of his idea for a
North-South summit of the nation's rich and poor countries.
   But he was able to ensure that the leaders of the poor nations
had plenty of opportunities to mix and mingle with the presidents
and prime ministers of the mighty seven. He threw them together at
every opportunity.

   A Chevron tanker carrying 16.5 million
gallons of crude oil ran aground 10 miles south of here, but there
was no oil leakage or damage to the vessel's hull, a Coast Guard
spokesman said Saturday.
   The 785-foot tanker, the R. Hal Dean, became stuck in mud about 6
p.m Friday and was refloated by 10:15 a.m. Saturday, said Cmdr.
James Gormanson of the Coast Guard office in Mobile, Ala. Five
tugboats were used.
   ``Beginning about 4:30 a.m., they took 125,000 barrels off the
vessel to raise the vessel from the mud,'' Gormanson said. ``No
spill was noted.''
   ``We know of no oil in the water,'' said Larry Shanks, manager of
operations at Chevron's Pascagoula refinery.
   The tanker had been en route to the refinery when it ran aground
near the junction of the Pascagoula and Horn Island channels. The
Coast Guard closed a channel while crews refloated the vessel.
   The tanker continued on to the refinery after being refloated.
Its hull will be inspected by divers before the ship puts out to sea
again, said Petty Officer Scott Green of Coast Guard's Mobile, Ala.,
office.
   The R. Hal Dean is a ``lightering vessel,'' which off-loads
supertankers in the Gulf and carries the crude oil to port, Shanks
said.

<HEAD>Residents Report More Shooting in Somallia's Capital</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gunfire rang through Somalia's capital on
Saturday for a second straight day, residents said, and police
increased the death toll to 23 from clashes between security forces
and religious demonstrators.
   Police said 59 people were wounded in Friday's clashes in
Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, when security forces opened fire on
what the government termed ``troublemakers hiding behind the banner
of religion.''
   It was unclear what caused the violence.
   The government Friday gave the death toll as 10. It did not
explain why the casualty count was increased Saturday.
   In Italy, the Foreign Ministry summoned the ambassador from
Somalia on Saturday to express its concern about the lives of
Italians in the country. The ministry also said a military plane had
flown from Mogadishu to Nairobi on Saturday with about 40 Italians
who asked to leave Somalia.
   Residents, who spoke by telephone, said shots were heard
periodically around the East African capital Saturday but that the
shooting lacked the intensity of Friday's clashes.
   The residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the city
was otherwise calm and that authorities lifted a 6 p.m-6 a.m. curfew.
   Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre, in a statement broadcast
over state radio and monitored in Nairobi, offered his condolences
to the relatives of victims and said the clashes were over and
``things were back to normal.''
   The government said Friday that security forces opened fire after
religious demonstrators attacked them with stones, knives and sticks.
   A resident contacted by telephone Friday said it appeared troops
had opened fire as Moslem worshipers left their place of prayer.
Islam is the state religion in the overwhelmingly pastoral,
impoverished nation of about 9 million.
   Friday is normally the Moslem Sabbath, but July 14 also was the
occasion for feast and celebration of the hajj, the Moslem
pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca.
   There were reports during the week that several Moslem religious
leaders and other prominent citizens had been detained by
authorities, but it was not known whether the reported arrests were
related to the clashes.
   On July 9, a gunman killed Mogadishu's Roman Catholic bishop,
Salvatore Pietro Colombo. It was not known whether the disturbances
were connected to that incident. There are an estimated 2,000 Roman
Catholics in Somalia.
   Siad Barre, who has ruled since 1969, has not allowed journalists
to visit for more than a year.
   Since 1981, Somalia has battled the Somali National Movement,
which demands Barre's removal. Intensified fighting in the last 18
months has driven more than 200,000 Somalis into refugee camps in
neighboring Ethiopia.

   Masked Palestinians on Saturday reportedly
killed an Arab suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities,
and police concluded that the slaying of an elderly Israeli man was
tied to the uprising.
   The army imposed curfews on the Nur-Shams refugee camp near the
West Bank town of Nablus and on several refugee camps and villages
in the Gaza Strip.
   Nine Palestinians were reported wounded in scattered clashes with
Israeli soldiers in the occupied lands. In Jerusalem, four Arabs
were injured in Israeli stone-throwing attacks, the national news
agency Itim said.
   In West Bank town of Qalqilya, masked Palestinians broke into the
house of Mohammed Yusef Abu Khader, 60, accused him of collaborating
with Israeli officials and fatally stabbed him, Arab journalists and
Israel radio said.
   The death brought to 564 the number of Palestinians killed in the
19-month uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Most victims died in army gunfire, but more than 70 have been
killed by Palestinians who accused them of being collaborators.
   Police said that two 16-year-old Palestinians confessed to
murdering Zalman Yosef Schlein, 64, in the southern Israeli town of
Gan Yavne on Friday.
   Israel radio said one of the teen-agers stabbed the elderly
Jewish man while the other hit him on the head with an iron bar.
   Initial reports had said Schlein was slain in a dispute over
money.
   But Uzi Sandouri, spokesman for the southern police district,
said the murder was ``a premeditated nationalist killing.'' Sandouri
told The Associated Press the two suspects, whose names were not
released, were members of an underground group in Gaza City's
Shajaiya quarter.
   Schlein's death brought to 36 the number of Israelis slain in the
uprising. Most of them were civilians.
   Arab hospital officials said a clash with soldiers left two
Palestinian teen-agers from Nur-Shams injured, one with serious
gunshot wounds to the chest and stomach. In Tulkarem refugee camp,
Israeli soldiers shot and wounded an 8-year-old boy in the thigh
with a plastic bullet, Arab doctors said.
   In the Gaza Strip, the army ordered all male residents of Beit
Hanoun aged 15 to 50 to gather at a local agricultural school while
the village was placed under curfew, Arab reports said.
   Youths who ran away from the village told Arab journalists
soldiers checked the residents' identity cards against computerized
lists and arrested at least 50 suspected ringleaders. The military
command said it was checking the report.
   At least six Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with
troops in Gaza's Jabaliya and Rafah refugee camps, Arab hospital
officials said.
   The army confirmed two wounded in the West Bank and three in Gaza.

<HEAD>Fire Season Simmers After Two Week Send-off</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a frenzied two weeks to kick off the
West's wildfire season, activity scaled back to a simmer by week's
end at the federal Boise Interagency Fire Center.
   But old hands at the national command post know the slack is only
a lull between storms _ a chance to sharpen shovels, restock
supplies and rest before the next onslaught.
   High-tech sensors to detect lightning strikes offer clues, but
where fires will rage is beyond even the center's experts in
firefighting tactics, manpower allocation, weather forecasting and
logistics.
   ``All we can say for sure is conditions remain hot and dry. The
rest is up to Mother Nature,'' said spokesman Arnold Hartigan. ``We
are far from being out of the fire season yet.''
   The Boise center is the federal government's logistics and
support nerve center for firefighting activities across North
America.
   There were 33,388 fires reported nationwide to the Boise center
through Thursday. That was well below the 56,489 reported through
July 13 last year, when blazes across the northern Rockies were
beginning to spread rapidly through drought-parched brush and timber.
   Almost 6 million acres were burned last year, including more than
1 million acres of Yellowstone National Park, where flames changed
the famous landscape for generations. Federal agencies spent almost
$584 million on firefighting.
   This year's fires, although not as numerous, are bigger.
Nationwide, they had burned almost 130,000 acres more through
Thursday than the 1.1 million acres blackened by the same time in
1988.
   Officials say the reasons include large spring blazes in Florida
and the Southwest, barely accessible terrain and plentiful,
well-cured fuel after a number of years without fires in this
season's hot spots.
   The 1989 fires also are further south. The focus of fire activity
last summer was Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Oregon and northern
California. This year it's Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and
Southern California.
   ``It's where the drought is,'' Hartigan said. ``The pattern has
shifted southwest. But I'd have to say that almost all of the West,
with very few exceptions, is still not entirely recovered from four
years of drought.''
   As far east as Nebraska, where the impact of drought is more
often seen in withering corn fields, fire is taking its toll.
   But overall, the first assault of the 1989 fire season still
pales in comparison with the memory of 1988.
   About 12,500 firefighters were in the field at the height of
activity last week. There were about 30,000 during the first week of
September last year, including 5,600 Army and Marine troops.
   Hartigan said the help provided by those crews, primarily at
Yellowstone, gave fire bosses an extra tool they hope will be
unnecessary this summer.
   ``What we learned is military troops are physically fit, they're
disciplined and we can train them to do what we need to do in just a
couple of days,'' he said. ``We're not anticipating the need for
that, but we want to be prepared.''

<HEAD>White House Raises Possibility of Breakthrough in Mexico Debt Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico, test case for the United States' new
strategy to ease the foreign debt problem, may clinch a deal shortly
with bankers to trim its $100 billion loan portfolio, a White House
official said Saturday.
   ``It is in the dotting the `i' and crossing the `t' stage on some
of the tough details that are important both of Mexico and the
banks,'' John Sununu told reporters.
   Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff, raised the possibility
of an agreement by Sunday's conclusion of the economic summit of the
seven major industrialized nations in Paris.
   Bush and other officials want an early end to the talks with
Mexico to prove the viability of its new approach on the $1.3
trillion debt of developing nations. The strategy, marking a sharp
turn in American policy, emphasizes debt forgiveness or reduction
for the poorer nations.
   Finance ministers taking part in the summit from the United
States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan called on
commercial banks to play their part in the latest debt plan.
   ``We felt the banks should get on with the negotiations,'' said
Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson. ``We feel the resources
that are in place are adequate to do the job.''
   Toyoo Gyoten, deputy Japanese finance minister, said, ``The main
thrust was we have to continue to put the wind in the sails (of
bankers) and keep it moving.''
   In supporting the current approach, the officials turned aside
fresh pleas for more help from leaders of poorer nations, who were
in town to mark Friday's 200th anniversary of the French revolution.
   In their economic talks, summit participants were generally
upbeat about the economic outlook but warned of the threat posed by
rising inflation in some countries.
   ``There's no recession talk at all,'' said Wilson. ``There's no
country who saw a recession on the horizon or the possibility of a
recession on the horizon.''
   But, he said, ``Inflation is a problem we must continue to deal
with, that we must continue to be vigilant on.''
   The officials also stressed the importance of correcting the
budget and trade imbalances run up by some countries.
   They urged countries to make sure the current round of trade
liberalization end on a successful note by their scheduled 1990
deadline. The talks, under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, have been hampered by disputes over agricultural
subsidies and other issues. The 96-nation GATT is a forum and
arrangement to promote free world trade.
   Much of the attention of the economic discussions has been
focused on Mexico's debt negotiations.
   Mexico is the developing world's No. 2 debtor, behind Brazil. It
has often taken the lead in finding new ways to ease the debt load.
   Sununu, showing his thumb and index finger nearly touching, said
Mexican officials and private bankers ``are now about that far
apart.''
   He said another bargaining session was expected ``in the next 24
hours or so. And it is hoped that at that meeting substantially most
of, if not all, of that gap will be closed.''
   Wilson also said the debt talks were ``pretty close.'' He said a
Mexican deal could ``clearly be an incentive to other countries'' to
make economic changes required for participation in the rich
countries' debt plan. It calls for debtor nations to cut inflation
rates, strengthen their currencies and take other steps to regain
their economic health.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said Friday the United States
was willing to work with the other industrialized nations to arrange
a $1 billion to $2 billion emergency loan to help Mexico meet its
obligations while it negotiates with private bankers for a new debt
accord.
   Mexico owes private lenders $54 billion, with about $15 billion
due American banks.
   In its negotiations with bankers, Mexico wants to slash both its
overall debt and the amount of its annual interest payments, which
run about $10 billion a year.
   Both sides have tentatively agreed on a 35 percent discount that
would mean savings to Mexico of about $3 billion in annual debt
payments, according to sources who demanded anonymity.

<UNK>Wealthy Seven to Ship Surpluses to Food-Short Poland ^By CAROL J.
WILLIAMS ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland will receive massive shipments of foodstuffs
in a campaign approved Saturday by leaders of the seven wealthiest
democracies in recognition of Warsaw's efforts at reform.
   Officials say the foodlift, the first definitive action endorsed
Saturday by the economic summit, could start within two weeks. The
leaders of the seven nations also will convene an international
conference within a few weeks to coordinate aid to Hungary and
Poland.
   The food aid is the first joint gesture by the world's wealthiest
democracies toward a socialist country in response to its reform
movement, though several Western nations have already forgiven or
rescheduled hard-currency debts to ease Warsaw's financial burdens.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski had appealed to the Paris
summit leaders to take immediate action to prevent a worsening of
Poland's economic crisis, and suggested food credits and debt
rescheduling as ways of lessening the burden.
   European nations are currently warehousing surplus stocks of
meat, sugar, grain and some dairy products that could ease the
crisis and diversify the diets of Poles afflicted by bad harvests
and a cumbersome distribution system.
   Claus Ehlermann, spokesman for the European Economic Community,
said officials within his organization took the summit statement on
food aid for Poland as a mandate to take stock of the specific items
available, what is needed by the Poles and to determine what other
governments outside the 12-nation community might be willing to
contribute.
   ``The food aid coordination will move very quickly, maybe as soon
as next week,'' Ehlermann said.
   Asked how long it would take to actually deliver food to Poland,
Ehlermann said the relief effort could be under way within two
weeks. He pointed out the EEC's experience in orchestrating urgent
aid to Ethiopia in past years.
   ``We're not sure what volume they have in mind,'' the EEC
spokesman said of the summit initiative.
   Ehlermann said grain and meat are in good supply in EEC surplus
warehouses, but that milk powder and butter were insufficient to
meet a huge demand.
   At the urging of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the seven
leaders included in their political communique the call for urgent
action to supply Poles with foods in chronic shortage there.
   At President Bush's behest, the statement broadened the planned
effort to ``concerted effort for reform'' across the board. And the
conference was opened to ``all interested countries,'' rather than
simply the seven-nation family of the summit participants.
   ``In my opinion, at least since the visit of President Bush to
Hungary and Poland, we see a more positive approach by the seven to
help these countries help themselves,'' observed West German Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hanns Schumacher. ``There had previously been a
lot of mistrust of the German position.''
   Bush visited those countries en route to Paris and praised the
Warsaw and Budapest governments for their efforts toward an improved
world political climate and protection of human rights.

   An 11-year-old American pilot completed his trip
across the Soviet Union on Saturday when he took off from the
Siberian town of Anadyr for Alaska, the official Soviet news agency
Tass said.
   Tony Aliengena, accompanied by his father and a Soviet pilot,
dealt with icy wings and flew through mountains at low altitude to
become the first private pilot to traverse Siberia, which stretches
across 12 time zones, Tass said.
   The boy from San Juan Capistrano, Calif., is trying to become the
youngest pilot to fly around the globe. Saturday's flight across the
Bering Strait to Nome will bring him back to his native land.
   But for the world record, he must still fly down the coast of
North America to California to return to his starting point in
Orange County, Calif.
   Also flying in his plane and in a second aircraft were his
mother, sister, a Russian pen pal and a documentary film crew.

<HEAD>Four Soldiers Killed In Clash Between Indian, Sri Lankan Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A soldier in Sri Lanka mistook Indian
peacekeeping troops for rebels and opened fire, sparking a gunbattle
that killed two Sri Lankan soldiers and two Indian soldiers, an
Indian government spokesman said Saturday.
   The clash Friday was the first of its kind since Indian troops
were sent to Sri Lanka nearly two years ago to quell the civil war,
but the spokesman called the gunbattle an accident and said both
countries considered the matter closed.
   The Sri Lankan soldier fired on an Indian patrol of about 20
soldiers passing a remote jungle camp at 3 a.m. Friday, setting off
a brief firefight, said the spokesman, who commented on condition of
anonymity.
   The shooting occurred near Akbopana, about 130 miles northeast of
Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital.
   Relations between the two governments have grown increasingly
prickly in recent weeks since Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe
Premadasa demanded that India withdraw its peacekeeping force by
July 29.
   The exchange of fire between the two sides ``lasted for a short
while. It was stopped when the mistake was realized,'' the
government spokesman said.
   ``It was decided to treat the matter as closed and not to
publicize it,'' he added.
   Premadasa's government has enforced censorship in Sri Lanka since
July 6.
   ``Two Indian soldiers were killed and five were wounded. On the
Sri Lankan side, two reportedly were killed and a few wounded,'' the
Indian government spokesman said.
   Another source, speaking on condition he was not identified
further, said two Sri Lankans were confirmed dead.
   Sri Lankan Tamil guerrillas, who have attacked both Sri Lankan
and Indian soldiers, sometimes wear military-style uniforms and have
been known to travel in stolen military vehicles.
   The Indian spokesman said the Indian soldiers were on foot.
However, this seemed unlikely _ especially at in the dark _ because
of the danger of guerrilla ambushes and leopard attacks.
   The Indian peacekeeping force was dispatched to Sri Lanka on July
30, 1987, after India and Sri Lanka signed an accord designed to end
the war by Tamil guerrillas fighting for an independent homeland.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese-dominated
government. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population.
   India became involved in the internal affairs of its small
neighbor because of its role as the region's chief power and the
political clout of its own Tamil minority of 60 million.

<HEAD>Singer Loses Paternity Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Tom Jones lost a paternity suit filed by a
27-year-old woman who spent three nights with him at a Manhattan
hotel two years ago, her lawyer said Saturday.
   A Family Court judge ruled Friday that Jones fathered 1-year-old
Jonathan Jones Berkery, who was born to Katherine Berkery on June
27, 1988, said Raoul Felder, Ms. Berkery's attorney.
   Judge Judith B. Sheindlin of Manhattan Family Court ordered
Jones, 48, to pay a weekly sum of $200 to Ms. Berkery for the
maintenance of the child, Felder said.
   When the ruling was made, Ms. Berkery was crying, Felder said.
``The baby was in the court and she said to the baby, `Now, you have
a father.'''
   The judge set a court hearing for Sept. 5 to hear the lawyer's
request for a larger monthly sum for his client.
   A message left at the White Plains home of one of Jones' lawyers
was not immediately returned. There was no answer at the Manhattan
law office of another attorney representing the singer.
   Felder said the judge's ruling was based on his client's
testimony and a blood and tissue test that showed there was a 99.76
percent degree of probability that Jones was the boy's father.
   He noted that Jones, who has a British wife, ``never showed up in
court to explain or deny'' that the child was his.
   Attorneys for the Welsh singer charged Ms. Berkery was a
prostitute and lied about her background.
   Ms. Berkery, an unmarried former restaurant manager, met Jones on
Oct. 29, 1987, at a restaurant and the couple spent three nights at
the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, Felder said.
   Jones recently scored a hit single with a remake of Prince's
``Kiss.'' He is best known for his singles ``It's Not Unusual'' and
``She's a Lady.''

   Harmony and reverence for human rights echoed
Saturday from the summit document adopted by leaders of seven
democracies in a windowless room on the 35th floor of the Grand
Arch, France's newest national symbol.
   On the bicentennial of the French Revolution, it was only natural
that President Bush and his six partners reaffirmed their commitment
to freedom and democratic principles even as they pointedly urged
China to cease its repression of pro-democracy forces.
   But facing no immediate threats to their security or their
economies, the summiteers issued a mild communique.
   It thundered at terrorists without identifying their supporters.
   It skirted the oppressive hunger of the undernourished Third
World.
   And it pledged no cold cash for Poland and Hungary to smooth the
transition of the two Soviet bloc countries to free market economies.
   Even before the leaders opened their deliberations Friday evening
at a lavish dinner of stuffed lobster and lamb, washed down with
Chateau Montrose 1918, a tentative U.S. proposal to create a
``clearinghouse'' for aid to Poland and Hungary was jettisoned.
   At the last minute, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, working
in tandem with Bush, won approval for a conference of ``all
interested countries'' later this summer to consider Poland's urgent
food problems and ``concerted support for reform'' in the two
countries.
   Bush paved the way with letters to his summit partners before he
came to Paris. For now, Secretary of State James A. Baker III told
reporters, the site, agenda and participants in the aid-for-Poland
conference have not been determined.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist host presiding
over a gathering of largely conservative leaders, found no support
for his proposal to set up an international conference with poor
countries to consider ways to ease their staggering $1.3 trillion
debt. Mitterrand had to abandon the idea.
   With some two dozen heads of Third World countries here as
bicentennial guests, the communique offered hopeful rhetoric _ but,
as expected, not much else.
   The section on China called on the World Bank to postpone new
loans as a way of registering ``our deep sense of condemnation''
over Beijing's repressive measures. Also, Chinese students
apprehensive about returning home were assured they could stay
indefinitely in the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Italy
and West Germany.
   No sanctions were recommended, an apparent ratification of Bush's
policy of taking a measured approach to events in Beijing. Baker
said the President had taken the lead on the subject at the summit.
   ``We look to the Chinese authorities to create conditions which
will avoid their isolation and provide for a return to cooperation
based upon the resumption of movement towards political and economic
reform and openness,'' the communique said with a diplomatic lack of
directness.
   And while the seven leaders encouraged ``greater freedom and
democracy'' in Central and Eastern Europe, they evinced no sign of
fervor or immediate aid to match U.S. incentives of $115 million and
$25 million that Bush extended to Poland and Hungary during his
visits there.
   Even so, Baker was pleased with the overall results. He said the
leaders got along so well they may be able to conclude their
deliberations ahead of schedule on Sunday.
   Having attended nine summits as White House chief of staff,
Treasury secretary and now secretary of state, Baker said this was
``the most harmonious and one of the most productive summits that I
have attended.''
   Bush, after breakfast Saturday with British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, dismissed the absence of specific aid commitments
from his summit partners.
   ``There have been some misconceptions we would come in here with
a dollar package,'' the president said. ``I managed to convey in
Poland that that was not the case and here it is not the case.''
   He said the communique ``vindicated'' his approach.
   Mrs. Thatcher said, meanwhile, ``We are all very anxious to help.
We are all helping, each in our own way.''

   Mediators from the Organization of
American States said Saturday that the government and opposition
leaders have agreed to hold talks to resolve Panama's political
crisis.
   A statement by the mission from the Organization of American
States said the talks were scheduled to begin Sunday ``without an
agenda, without preconditions and with the commitment that no topic
would be excluded.''
   The Defense Forces will send representatives to the talks as part
of the government delegation, the statement said. The Defense Forces
chief, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, is the nation's de factor leader
and is under pressure to quit.
   Up to now, the position of the Defense Forces and the government
has been that Noriega's situation was not subject to discussion.
Saturday's announcement ``that no topic would be excluded'' seemed
to indicate a change of attitude.
   It will be the first time that the Defense Forces, government and
opposition have held talks.
   The OAS delegation arrived Saturday on its third mediation visit
since Noriega's regime annulled an election May 7 that international
observers say opposition candidates won by a landslide.
   Ecuador's Foreign Minister Diego Cordovez is heading the mission,
which includes foreign ministers Mario Palencia of Guatemala and
Sadeo Badseo of Trinidad-Tobago, and OAS Secretary-General Joao
Baena Soares of Brazil.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara, backed by a
coalition of his own Liberal Party, the Christian Democrats and the
Nationalist Liberal Republican Party, is demanding Noriega's ouster
and that the government admit it lost the election.
   The opposition also accuses Noriega of human rights violations,
corruption and press censorship.
   Noriega has been under pressure from the United States to step
down since two federal grand juries indicted him in Florida in
February 1988 on drug trafficking and money-laundering charges.
   Noriega has accused the United States of trying replace him with
a docile government that would agree to a continuation of a U.S.
military presence beyond Dec. 31, 1999, when the Panama Canal is to
be turned over to Panama.

   As leaders of the world's seven richest industrial
nations huddled Saturday to discuss global warming, pollution and
other threats to the planet earth, environmentalists challenged them
to turn their talk into action.
   ``Rhetoric is terrific, discussions are great, but we feel it's
time for specific commitments,'' said Rafe Pomerance of the World
Resources Institute.
   The summit leaders have already made the environment a
cornerstone of their 15th annual economic summit. They addressed the
issue in passing in the political communique issued earlier Saturday.
   ``We see good opportunities for the countries of West and East to
work together ... to safeguard the resources and the environment,''
the leaders declared.
   One-third of the final communique was expected to cover the
environment, a reflection of the growing sentiment around the world
for a solution to the world's pollution problems.
   During their discussions Saturday, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher told her colleagues: ``No generation has a
freehold on this earth. All we have is a life tenancy with a full
repairing lease.''
   A British spokesman, who relayed Mrs. Thatcher's comments, said
there was general consensus among the summit partners that
environmental problems should be attacked through existing
international institutions, including the U.N. Environmental
Program, the World Meteorological Organization and other U.N.
agencies on climate changes.
   A Canadian official said West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was
``particularly firm'' in insisting that tropical rain forests be
given urgent attention.
   The official, who briefed reporters on condition he not be
identified, said Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said the
communique should express the need for a barometer or yardstick to
measure the environment costs caused by economic development.
   According to the British spokesman, who also requested anonymity,
Mrs. Thatcher said ``the guiding philosophy should be recognition of
the principle that environmentally senstive development is both
possible and essential.''
   The Bush administration views the environment as an area in which
the United States can provide the leadership.
   ``This is the 15th summit of the leaders of the seven countries
here,'' said William Reilly, administrator of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. ``None has ever come close to paying the
attention to the environment that this one has.''
   Among the items on the table: air and water pollution, including
acid rain, oil spills and damage to the ozone layer from
chloroflurocarbons in the upper atmosphere, a problem that Reilly
said could lead to the ``potential destablilization of the planet.''
   ``On all of these issues, we see that there is an emerging
consensus on the part of the leaders of the governments represented
here ... that these issues are significant, important, are worthy of
concern at the very highest levels of government,'' Reilly said.
   But he said no formal agreement on a course of action was
expected when the final summit communique is released Sunday.
   ``It's not the function ... of governments to come together at
summits and set out specific measures to reduce, for example, the
unemployment rate or the rate of inflation,'' he said.
   ``Rather, the point of summit conversations is to identify
problems, determine general categories of priority, give a degree of
consensus, if that exists, identifying, sometimes, areas of
disagreement that have to be resolved,'' said Reilly. ``That is
what's happening on the environment.''
   The final communique is likely to express little beyond a unified
call among the industrial powers for decisive action by all nations
as well as a reiteration of concern about depletion of the ozone
layer, ocean pollution, dirty urban air and the need for a
``framework'' agreement that may eventually lead to a multinational
treaty on global warming.
   That isn't enough for environmentalists.
   ``Diplomacy is great, but it's got to run according to the
atmosphere's timetable, not political leaders','' Pomerance told
reporters.
   ``We wish that the United States would come with a proposal to
make a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the end
of this century,'' said David Gardner, legislative director of the
Sierra Club.
   Gardner said it appeared that neither Bush nor Reilly had
``brought such a proposal to this summit. And that's a major
disappointment to us.''
   Kohl was pushing a proposal to convert Third World debt into a
fund for protection of endangered tropical rain forests. But that
idea has generated a lukewarm response from the United States and
Great Britain and appeared to have little chance for success.
   Japan, in a statement of its ``major contributions'' to the
summit, outlined its plan to give developing countries $2.25 billion
over three years for projects to improve the environment. It said it
will send a mission to Eastern Europe to determine how to attack the
problems on a global level.

   A pilot told investigators Saturday he
didn't know how he was shot and has no recollection of his 800-mile,
apparently unconscious flight down the East Coast in his small
plane, officials said.
   Federal investigators talked to Thomas Root in his hospital room
for the first time since the lawyer was rescued Thursday in Bahamian
waters where his single-engine plane crashed. Afterward, authorities
learned Root had been shot.
   Root told a federal air safety investigator in a 40-minute
interview that he did not recall the shooting. He was interviewed
separately by an FBI agent.
   ``We have no reason to disbelieve him at this point. We have some
questions. There are some inconsistencies,'' said Andrew Alston of
the National Transportation Safety Board. ``He doesn't remember a
gunshot wound and we see one. That is a large inconsistency that we
hope to resolve.''
   Root, a gun collector, told Alston that he kept a loaded
.32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver in the glove compartment of his
plane. Root said he doesn't remember anything after a radio
conversation in which he reported having difficulty breathing, the
NTSB investigator said. Root's plane ran out of gas and crashed
about four hours later.
   ``His statement to me was indicative of an oxygen deprivation
situation,'' Alston said. ``The next thing he remembered was waking
up and seeing water coming through and around the windshield.''
   Alston said officials will conduct further tests, including
checking for carbon monoxide in a blood sample, and talk to the gun
manufacturer about possible causes of the shooting.
   Root was in stable condition at Memorial Hospital in Hollywood,
north of Miami. He had been under heavy sedation Friday.
   ``It's an odd story all right,'' Root's brother-in-law, Brett
Geer, said after a visit Friday. ``With this wound and him not being
able to recollect how he got it, I'm sure there is reason for an
investigation.''
   ``Even though there are a lot of unanswered questions, the one
thing we are certain of is that he did not make any attempt on his
life,'' said brother W. Todd Root of Burlingame, Calif.
   Root underwent surgery at the hospital Thursday night.
   ``He's a very lucky guy,'' said Dr. Robert Cohen, who operated on
Root. ``I don't know if he wanted to be lucky. We'll find out sooner
or later.''
   Root, 36, of Alexandria, Va., apparently became unconscious while
piloting his Cessna from Washington National Airport to Rocky Mount,
N.C.
   The plane was on autopilot and military pilots shadowed his
aircraft for nearly four hours. The plane ran out of gas and crashed
in mile-deep waters 14 miles west of the Bahamian island of
Eleuthera. Root swam to a raft, where rescuers pulled him to safety.
   Geer said Root told him the bullet wound was not self-inflicted
and could have occurred when the impact of the crash triggered the
pistol.
   On Friday, a U.S. Customs Service official said authorities found
35 guns, many of them loaded, in a search of Root's plane last April
at the Manassas Airport in Virginia.
   All of the guns were legal under federal law, and all but one
under state law, which led to a state misdemeanor charge. The
arsenal included assault-style rifles and three .357-caliber Magnum
pistols.
   In North Carolina, Secretary of State Rufus Edmisten said his
office has been investigating security fraud allegations against a
company with which Root acted as an attorney. Edmisten said the
lawyer knew he was under investigation.

<TEXT>
   Finance ministers of the seven major industrial
nations agreed Saturday to set up an international task force to
trace laundered drug money.
   Japanese Deputy Finance Minister Toyoo Gyoten said the ministers
expressed grave concern that such laundering eventually ``will
really undermine the credibility of the financial systems.''
   The ministers spoke of the problem during talks organized as part
of the seven-nation Paris summit ending Sunday.
   A British spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said the
task force would ``presumably'' operate under the aegis of the
International Monetary Fund, the Bank of International Settlements,
and the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.
   Gyoten told reporters, ``There was a clear understanding, an
agreement that efforts should be strengthened to prevent the
utilization of banks and other financial institutions for the
purpose of money-laundering.''
   Canadian Foreign Minister Joseph Clark said the drug problem was
a dominant topic among the heads of state at dinner Friday night and
lunch Saturday.
   ``There is a general sense this is a major international problem
to which the response is not adequate, that there needs to be more
imagination and effectiveness in devising a more effective response
both to the demand problem and source problem,'' Clark told a news
conference.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher outlined at Saturday's afternoon
session her plan to hold an international conference in Britain this
fall on ways of curbing demand for drugs, primarily through
educational programs.
   Mrs. Thatcher regards damping down demand as a key complement to
pressure from industrialized countries on Third World nations to
curb the production of drugs, particularly cocaine and crack.

   Leftist guerrillas attacked one of the largest
state-owned mines in the country, destroying machinery and forcing
suspension of operations for six months, police said Saturday.
   Two mine workers were reported wounded.
   About 100 guerrillas from the leftist Shining Path group attacked
the Morococha mine Friday, setting off dynamite that destroyed
mining machinery, fuel tanks, electrical generators and electronic
control panels, police said.
   The mine, owned by the state mining company Centromin-Peru,
produces copper, lead, zinc and silver. It is located in the Andean
highlands 70 miles northeast of Lima at more than 13,000 feet above
sea level in the department of Junin.
   Police in Huancayo, Junin's capital, said the guerrillas first
attacked the police station of Morococha with dynamite to prevent
officers from reaching the mine.
   Two mine workers who tried to repel the attack on the mine were
seriously wounded, the police said.
   Centromin-Peru employs about 17,000 miners, 3,000 of them at the
Morococha mine. The company brings in about $300 million a year to
this impoverished nation.
   The Shining Path has been battling Peru's elected government
since 1980. The government says more than 15,000 people have died in
the war.
   Mining companies have been asking officials for more protection
against terrorist attacks. Rebel groups often target the isolated
mining camps to hinder production and steal dynamite, food and
medicine.

   Local Communist Party officials and mine executives
have joined strikes in the Kuzbass coal region of western Siberia to
protest centralized control over the industry, Soviet newspapers
reported Saturday.
   Officials from the Mining Ministry and regional party committees
appealed to miners in at least nine cities to return to work,
according to dispatches from Kuzbass, one of the country's most
important coal-producing regions.
   Newspapers described a chaotic situation in Kuzbass, which is
about 2,560 miles east of Moscow.
   The situation has developed into a battle by miners and mine
executives to wrest control from the Moscow-based ministry, the
newspaper Sovietskaya Rossia said. The miners want authority to set
production levels and improve working conditions and such amenities
as housing, schools and food, it said.
   ``Strike committees have formed in the mines,'' Sovietskaya
Rossia reported. ``Most of the people in authority have joined them.
That includes many communists, trade union representatives and party
secretaries.''
   Tens of thousands of miners met Saturday night with Mining
Minister Mikhail I. Shchadov on the central square of Prokopevsk,
about 1,600 miles east of Moscow, according to Tass and a local mine
official.
   ``The minister is promising help,'' said Yevgeny G. Koslov, an
assistant mine surveyor in Prokopevsk. ``They are having a
dialogue.''
   The Communist Party newspaper Socialisticheskaya Industria said
two mining executives who joined the strikes were Mikhail I. Naidov,
head of a group of mines in the town of Prokopevsk, and I.A. Khamin,
director of the Baidayevsky Mine in an unidentified town.
   ``Independence is just not possible,'' Naidov said, because
Moscow-based ministries make up to 90 percent of economic decisions
affecting local enterprises and governments.
   ``They say, `You just mine the coal, and we will guarantee the
rest,'' Socialisticheskaya Industria quoted Naidov as saying.
   ``But people do not have what they were guaranteed. People have
nothing worthwhile, no housing, no food, no leisure facilities,''
said Naidov.
   ``This is intolerable. It is not the mine but the individual who
should be the master. The essence of the protest is this: We want to
work more effectively,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Strikes have been spreading throughout Kuzbass, despite
settlements reported with miners in two cities, Osiniki and
Mezhdurechensk, where the strikes began Monday.
   Authorities had reported an end to the strike Thursday, but
miners then expanded their agenda from economic issues, such as
food, housing and health care, to broader demands for political
change.
   The government newspaper Izvestia, however, said the strikes
spread because no one explained to residents of the region that the
settlement in Mezhdurechensk applied to the entire area.
   On Saturday, thousands of miners and their families held protest
rallies in towns throughout the region, newspapers reported.
   The crisis was the worst in Prokopevsk, where production was
virtually halted, Socialisticheskaya Industria reported.
   ``Events in the Kuzbass have taken a sharp turn,'' the newspaper
said. Although miners returned to work in Mezhdurechensk, in other
mining towns in the ``the situation has sharply intensified.''
   Published reports said miners were striking in nine cities,
including Prokopevsk, Novokuznetsk, Kisilevsk, Lenin-Kuznets, and
Kemerevo. It was not clear where the other strikes were going on.
   None of the reports estimated the number of strikers.
   An administrator at one of the mines in Mezhdurechensk said all
the miners there had returned to work, but he refused to estimate
the number of mines or miners involved regionwide.
   ``We never had strikes like this before. Never,'' said the
administrator, who spoke in a telephone interview from Moscow and
refused to give his name.
   Miners in Byelov and Anzhero-Sudzhesk continued to work but still
made demands on authorities, the reports said.
   The reports said, however, that strike committees were keeping
social order.
   ``At their demand, sales of liquor were stopped and narcotics
control points were established along highways,'' Pravda reported.
   But the Communist Party newspaper had harsh words for the
Democratic Union, a small but widespread group of activists who seek
legalization of multiple political parties.
   ``Efforts were made by the so-called `Democratic Union' and
several other informal organizations to spread anti-Soviet slogans,
but they received a resolute rebuff'' in two cities, the newspaper
said.
   Authorities throughout the region tried to talk the miners back
to work.
   ``Democracy means not only rights, but also responsibility,
discipline and organization,'' Socialisticheskaya Industria warned.

   A sculpture of a nude woman at the
Arkansas Arts Center is being kept under wraps when children visit
because the director doesn't want their teen-age guides to be
embarrassed.
   Townsend Wolfe, director of the center, said he strongly opposes
censorship, but volunteered to drape the work by sculptor John
DeAndrea when children under 12 tour the center's Rockefeller
Gallery.
   ``These young children come in with part-time teen-age leaders.
They might turn around and walk out and never come back again,''
said Wolfe.
   ``I don't understand the controversy. We've got much stronger
nude pictures hanging currently, and have had,'' said Wolfe.
   An exhibit showing a couple making love was on display
uneventfully for four months, Wolfe said. He added, though, ``Three
months ago, I got called up and told that the caller was praying for
my soul.''
   With the sculpture-covering, ``some will think those prayers were
answered,'' Wolfe said with a laugh. ``But the decision we reached
on this particular piece was not that it was provocative, but
because of the younger visitors we have in the summer months.''
   Wolfe said the draping ``was not a request of any group. It was a
judgmental call I made.''
   DeAndrea said Thursday from Santa Cruz, Calif., that he wasn't
mad about the draping. But he wasn't pleased, either.
   ``It's happened a lot of times,'' he told the Arkansas Gazette.
``I wish they had enough sense not to do it, but I guess they don't.
It's the same old same old.''
   The life-size sculpture shows a woman leaning backward while
seated on a box. It is displayed with a sculpture of a clothed man,
a self-portrait of DeAndrea.
   Wolfe said he expected increased interest in the exhibit because
of news coverage about the draping, most notably a front-page story
in the Gazette headlined, ``Nude art clothed in cover-up.''
   The sculpture is part of the Goldstrom family collection making a
three-year national tour.
   A security guard at the arts center, Jackie Martin, said he had
seen some smaller children peeking under the cloth covering.
   ``It distracts them,'' Martin said.

<HEAD>Investigators Hoped To Find Records When They OK'd Green River Search</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 9th graf, `Evan said...,' to CORRECT that Stevens' attorneys
had not, sted had, allowed their client to talk to police.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>

   Authorities obtained a court order to search the
homes of a Green River serial killings suspect because they hoped to
find records detailing aliases he may have used, a top police
commander said.
   But what police took Wednesday from two Spokane residences used
by William Jay Stevens II were 55 cartons and bags of materials
including 1,800 videotapes, travel receipts, police uniforms, more
than two dozen firearms and about 100 police badges.
   Police suspected Stevens, a onetime Gonzaga University law
student who has been jailed since January on unrelated charges, of
using aliases that could not be checked out without obtaining
records from his house, said King County police Capt. Robert C.
Evans, commander of the Green River Task Force.
   ``That was the only reason we did the search warrant,'' he said
in an interview in Saturday editions of the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer. ``We know he kept a lot of records.''
   Stevens, 38, has not been charged in any of the deaths and
disappearances and denies any involvement in the case. But in a
court document released Thursday, he was labeled a ``viable
suspect'' in what has been called the nation's worst unsolved serial
killings case.
   Evans said it would take a month to examine the large amount of
material taken under search warrant from two Spokane homes used by
Stevens. One thing was ruled out, though, he said: The items did not
include any clothing, jewelry or other effects from Green River
victims.
   Police would not comment on the contents of the videotapes found
in the two residences, except to say that at least some of them were
homemade.
   The Green River killer, named for a stream south of Seattle where
some victims were found, has been blamed for the deaths of as many
as 48 Northwest women, many of them prostitutes, beginning seven
years ago this month.
   Evans said the search warrants of the homes were sought because
Stevens' attorneys had not allowed their client to talk to police.
   ``We tried not to have to do this,'' Evans said. ``We made over a
dozen efforts to interview him so we wouldn't have to go through
this process.''
   But Craig Beles, a lawyer for Stevens, accused the task force of
``grasping at straws'' and said his client ``is concerned he's being
singled out as the answer to a longtime investigation.''
   He said Stevens ``is a colorful character, but he's no murderer.''
   In a lengthy affidavit used to obtained a search warrant, friends
of Stevens are quoted as saying he believed prostitutes were
spreading AIDS, wanted to make films of hookers being dismembered
and told others the killing of Green River victims had been filmed.
   Stevens is jailed in Seattle, serving a one-year term for the
burglary of a police equipment supply store in 1979 and additional
time for walking away from a work-release center in 1981.
   While police identified Stevens several years ago as someone to
check, Evans said ``Manhunt,'' a nationally syndicated television
show broadcast last December about the Green River killing, prompted
a phone call directing investigators to Gonzaga University.
   That led to his arrest in January on the old escape charge. He is
due to be held in that case at least until September, authorities
said.
   Evans said there was no ``smoking gun,'' but said an initial
study of documents found earlier showed that Stevens' movements
between 1981 and 1989 sometimes closely paralleled the killings.
   A spokeswoman for the Women's Coalition to Stop the Green River
Murders, a group that has frequently criticized the task force's
efforts, said Friday that the searches of Stevens' homes might be
nothing more than a police publicity ploy.
   ``I guess we're jaded at this point,'' said Cookie Hunt, noting
the task force has carried out several search warrants in the past
without producing any arrests.

   Weather forecasts here will have something new
beginning this week _ the ``scorch factor,'' which two local
physicians hope will remind folks of the dangers of skin cancer.
   With a shoebox-size device on the roof of a Baylor University
Medical Center building, Alan Menter and Chuck Phillips can
calculate how long it will take the sun's ultraviolet rays to start
burning unprotected skin.
   The physicians have begun reporting to the National Weather
Service ultraviolet readings at 10 a.m., noon and 3 p.m., along with
the number of minutes a sun-sensitive person can be exposed without
harm.
   One Dallas television station will add the roast quotient to its
evening weather reports starting Monday, and several other TV and
radio stations have expressed interest in the index.
   Similar reports are available through the weather service in
Tucson, Ariz., and Atlanta, Ga., Phillips said.
   ``We're trying to make people aware that there is a sun out there
that is doing damage to their skin,'' said Phillips, a medical
center internist who is switching to dermatology. Menter, a
dermatologist, is medical director of the Baylor Psoriasis Center.
   Texas has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the country,
Phillips said.
   ``Of course, we're in the sun belt, and in the south you get more
ultraviolet exposure,'' he said. ``And because of the weather,
people tend to develop more of an outdoor lifestyle. So skin cancer
is a real problem.''
   He added that certain types of skin cancer can be fatal if not
treated early, and sun damage can also hasten the aging of the skin.
   People who stay outside longer than the index suggests _ usually
15 to 30 minutes on a sunny or partly-cloudy day _ should cover up
or apply sun screens, Phillips said.
   He added that weather can fool people. ``They equate heat with
sunburn, so they think August is going to be the peak'' in
ultraviolet radiation, he said. In fact, the ultraviolet rays peak
in June and July, then decline steadly to late December, when the
sun is farthest away from the Northern Hemisphere, Phillips said.

   Portions of the censored versions of the notebooks which North
handed over to Congress played a role in recently ended Senate
confirmation hearings for Donald Gregg, President Bush's
ambassadorial nominee to South Korea. Gregg was Bush's national
security affairs adviser when he was vice president.
   At a June 15 hearing, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass., focused on a meeting of Bush, Gregg and former CIA
operative Felix Rodriguez on Jan. 24, 1985.
   North's notebooks contain several references to Rodriguez the
week of the Jan. 24, 1985, meeting, but North's lawyers blacked out
most of the detailed notes adjacent to the references to Rodriguez,
saying they were irrelevant to Congress' Iran-Contra inquiries.
   ``I think it's absolutely clear that North and Rodriguez were
setting up an illicit Contra aid operation the very same week that
Gregg and Rodriguez met to discuss Felix's desire to help in Central
America,'' Cranston said at the hearing. Kerry said the notebooks
should be produced in uncensored form.
   The Bush-Gregg-Rodriguez meeting took place as Rodriguez prepared
to leave for El Salvador, where he ended up assisting North's secret
resupply operation to the Contras at a time when Congress had banned
military aid to the rebel force.
   Gregg, who paved the way with U.S. officials for his longtime
friend Rodriguez to go to El Salvador, says he didn't know until
August 1986 that Rodriguez was assisting the Contras.
   Gregg says Rodriguez' mission was to assist the Salvadoran Air
Force, not the Contras, and that the Jan. 24, 1985, meeting with
Bush didn't touch on the Nicaraguan rebels.

   Thunderstorms spattered heavy rain on parts of northeast Kansas
and northwest Missouri on Saturday, flooding streets in the Kansas
City area.
   Heavy rain fell from Topeka to Kansas City, 60 miles to the east.
More than 2 inches of rain fell in one hour at Kansas City
International Airport.
   Flooding from heavy rains also occurred Saturday morning in the
northeast Texas counties of Delta, Hopkins and Hunt.
   Rain and scattered thunderstorms extended from southeast
Minnesota and southwest Wisconsin along the Mississippi Valley to
the Gulf Coast. Showers and thunderstorms also rumbled across the
Gulf Coast and South Atlantic coastal states. Columbia, S.C., had
more than 1{ inches of rain in one hour Saturday.
   In the West, an area of low pressure extended from the desert
Southwest across Nevada to Idaho. Unstable air produced
thunderstorms across portions of eastern Washington, Idaho and
extreme western Montana.
   Thunderstorms developed Saturday afternoon over southwest Texas
and across the New Mexico and Colorado Rockies.
   A high pressure system across the Northeast, however, kept the
region dry Saturday.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included more than 1{ inches at Topeka, El Dorado, Ariz., and
Columbia.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59 degrees at Oak Harbor,
Wash., to 104 degrees at Gila Bend, Ariz., and Phoenix. The low in
the Lower 48 on Saturday was 30 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Sunday called for scattered thunderstorms from
the middle and south Atlantic Coast states across the Tennessee
Valley and the Gulf coastal states to portions of the southern
Plains; and scattered showers and thunderstorms from the lower Ohio
Valley across the middle and upper Mississippi Valley to Upper
Michigan. Scattered thunderstorms were to develop over western
portions of the Plains, the Rocky Mountains and the northern plateau
region. Rain was expected to develop on the Washington coast.
   Predicted high temperatures were in the 60s and 70s along the
Pacific Coast and across Washington state; 70s from portions of the
upper and middle Mississippi Valley across the Great Lakes region
and the northern half of the Appalachians to New England; 100s in
portions of south-central and southwest Texas and some sections of
Utah; 100 to 115 degrees in the desert Southwest; and 80s and 90s
elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   Reseachers have successfully made the first test
run of the world's biggest atom smasher, a 17-mile circular tunnel
designed to unlock secrets of how the universe took shape,
scientists said Saturday.
   On Friday evening, scientists at the European Laboratory for
Particle Physics outside the capital sent a first beam of particles
around the new particle accelerator, known as the Large
Electron-Positron Collider or LEP.
   The $790 million machine, built underground beneath the
French-Swiss border, is expected to put the European lab ahead of
U.S. rivals in the search for new discoveries in high-energy
physics, although plans are in the works for a 53-mile super
collider in Texas.
   Carlo Rubbia, an Italian physics professor and Nobel laureate who
heads the lab, cheered along with other scientists in the control
room as instruments showed a positron beam completed its course in
50 minutes, said lab spokesman Neil Calder said.
   A positron is a positively charged antiparticle of an electron.
   ``This simply means that all parts of the machine, all the
magnets, are correctly positioned,'' said the spokesman for the lab
outside Geneva, known by the French acronym CERN.
   The collider, built over eight years with funding from CERN's 14
member states, is the most powerful particle accelerator and the
largest scientific instrument ever made.
   Rubbia says it should ``guarantee Europe a dominant position in
particle physics for many years to come.''
   The LEP will recreate with new sophistication the wild swirl of
matter just after the so-called big bang, the explosion many
scientists believe created the universe up to 20 billion years ago.
   The three-mile Stanford Linear Collider at Menlo Park, Calif., in
April won the race to produce the first so-called Z particles, which
scientists say could have existed naturally for only an instant
after a big bang.
   But the CERN machine is expected to produce thousands of Z
particles by September, opening a greater scope for discovery.
   Watching Z particles decay into other particles is expected to
yield new clues to the structure of matter and the development of
the universe.
   Rubbia shared the 1984 Physics Nobel Prize with Dutch scientist
Simon van der Meer for discovering the Z particle in an old particle
accelerator at CERN, but stronger colliders are needed to make
enough particles to allow scientists to draw conclusions.
   Z particles have also been produced at the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago. That four-mile track was the
biggest accelerator in the world until the new CERN machine was
built.

<HEAD>Soviet Officer Says All Golf II Submarines to Leave Baltic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All Soviet Golf II submarines, which
carry nuclear weapons, will be removed from the Baltic Sea early
next year, a Soviet naval commander was quoted as saying in an
interview published Saturday.
   General Staff officer Alexander Rudenko told the Dagens Nyheter
daily newspaper that the Soviet Union also would dislcose whether
its warships were carrying nuclear weapons if they were invited to a
Swedish port.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev previously had talked of
scrapping the dated Golf II submarines in the Baltic fleet, but he
gave no date.
   The submarines, which date to the 1960s, are 325 feet long. Each
carries three missile tubes, according to Jane's Fighting Ships.
   The Soviet Baltic fleet has six to eight vessels armed with
intermediate-range missiles.
   ``All Soviet nuclear submarines of the Golf II class will be
removed from the Baltic Sea at the beginning of next year,'' Dagens
Nyheter quoted Rudenko as saying. ``Now we only wait for the United
States to show its good intent.''
   A Swedish defense spokeman declined to say if the Soviet Union
has other types of nuclear submarines in the Baltic. He said no
Soviet ship has made a port call in Sweden in about 25 years.
   NATO ships refuse as a matter of policy to say whether they are
carrying nuclear weapons. All the Scandinavian countries have
policies banning nuclear weapons in their ports.
   ``If our aircraft carrier Kiev, which has nuclear weapons on
board, would be invited by Sweden,'' Rudenko was quoted as saying,
``we would leave the nuclear weapons at home before coming to
visit.''
   Rudenko was identified by the paper as an officer responsible for
peace and disarmament issues at the Soviet General Staff. Officials
at the Soviet Embassy declined to comment or expand on the report.
   Rudenko was in Sweden on Friday to participate in a Nordic youth
trip to the Soviet naval base in Murmansk on the Kola Peninsula.

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush, her wish fulfilled, had lunch at a
17th century chateau Saturday after touring a U.S. crafts exhibit
that made her ``proud to be an American.''
   As President Bush tended to matter of state at the 15th annual
economic summit, the first lady set off on her own.
   Mrs. Bush toured several rooms of the 17th chateau owned by the
Marquis and Marquise Jean-Louis de Ganay.
   ``Look at this, isn't it beautiful?'' marvelled Mrs. Bush as she
emerged in the blazing sunshine to tour the vast gardens with their
spring-fed ponds, laid out in the 17th century by the landscapist
Lenotre, who designed the Versailles gardens for Louis XIV.
   ``I want you to get used to me here,'' Mrs. Bush joked with her
host and hostess, the Marquis and Marquise Jean-Louis de Ganay.
   Joining Mrs. Bush on the tour were Susan Baker and Kitty Brady,
wives of the secretaries of state and treasury.
   ``Mrs. Bush wanted to see a chateau and pretty garden,'' said
Sondra Daley, a spokesman for the first lady.
   The choice was made by Ambassador Walter Curley and his wife, who
know the de Ganay family.
   Like many aristocratic owners, the de Ganays allow visitors to
pay admission to tour the chateau at certain times to defray
maintenance costs.
   Strolling around the gardens, Mrs. Bush called to two dogs to
pose with her for a picture. ``Come on you two dogs, they want us in
the center,'' she said.
   Referring to her own pet, she added, ``I hope Millie will take
note and not be jealous. She'll eat her heart out.''
   Earlier Saturday, Mrs. Bush toured the ``Craft USA Today'' show
at the Decorative Arts branch of the Louvre museum, where the work
of 183 American artisans, ranging from patchwork quilts to a ceramic
briefcase, is displayed.
   ``It makes you proud to be an American,'' she said.
   She looked at her watch to see if a wooden clock called ``Time to
Say Goodbye'' by Wendell Castle was keeping time. A museum spokesman
said it had not been wound.
   ``I love that,'' she said of an enormous tulipwood spheroid by
Edward Moulthrop.
   ``That's amazing,'' she said of a multicolored glass creation by
Dale Chihuly. ``One man blowing that. It's beautiful.''
   When someone asked if she would like it for her Maine vacation
house, she said, ``No, it's too grand for Kennebunkport.''
   Mrs. Bush posed holding hands with a glazed clay 10-foot-high
statue of a man splashed with garish colors by Viola Frey.
   ``It's just like in Washington, when you get your picture taken
with the president _ or the first lady,'' referring to the cardboard
photo setups popular with tourists outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

   France brought its glory days to a crescendo
Saturday by saluting its revolution's bicentennial with a storm of
sound and color over the city many French regard as the capital of
the world.
   A 45-minute spray of 170,000 rockets over the Eiffel Tower at
nightfall followed early morning fireworks.
   Before a final bouquet of multicolored bursts in the evening
show, jostling crowds gasped at the piece de resistance: a
200-foot-wide fresco of blue and red framing a white outline of a
ship symbolizing Paris. Blue, red, and white are the colors of the
French flag.
   On Friday night, a parade, created by advertising maverick
Jean-Paul Goude, presented a whimsical blend of history, folklore
and the outer limits of French fancy. Goude described it as two
hours of controlled madness.
   A million people mobbed the mile-long Champs-Elysees to see the
Florida A &amp; M University marching band dance the California worm, a
Russian ballarina waltz on ice skates with a polar bear, and lancers
fling flowing French tricolors like batons.
   Bronx drummers flanked a full-size locomotive, banging on
55-gallon steel barrels. Chinese students wheeled bicycles, solemnly
jingling their bells, under a banner reading, ``We Will Continue,''
a reference to the crushed pro-democracy movement in their homeland.
   On one gigantic float, a conductor-witchdoctor in a tux gyrated
atop a rolling mountain of pounding African drummers. At the summit,
six undulating Senegalese women, dressed in blue, white and red
gowns, depicted a waving French flag.
   Halfway through, singer Jessye Norman electrified the heart of
Paris with ``La Marseillaise,'' France's national anthem. Her
American nationality, organizers said, highlighted the revolution's
universal character.
   But the crux of a thrilling, infuriating weekend the French will
never forget seemed to be the traditional July 14 morning event,
when France paraded its missiles down the Champs-Elysees.
   Behind glass at the Place de la Concorde, President Francois
Mitterrand was flanked by the leaders of 33 nations from five
continents, including six of the richest and some of the poorest.
   He sat between George Bush, president of a superpower, and Felix
Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, symbol of an empire France
colonized and, by its measure, civilized.
   Bicentennial celebrations and a coinciding Group of Seven summit
of industrial nations drove home Mitterrand's message that France
sees itself neither as part of the First World nor the Third but
rather of a separate constellation illuminating the way for others.
   But not everyone shared official enthusiasm for the French
Revolution _ or its 1989 commemoration.
   Many Parisians fled town, unwilling to fete a violent civil war
or simply afraid of the crowds. Some who stayed grumbled bitterly at
the massive security blanket.
   ``To an old Parisian, this reminds me of something I have seen
before, but without the swastikas,'' remarked one old Parisian.
   Many saw ironies in the system of privilege that remains 200
years after the revolution.
   Only those with invitations, or the patience to wait six hours
along the route, got a good look at the parade. Television coverage
mostly missed the zany, impressionist mood.
   Thursday night's street dance at the Bastille was billed as the
world's biggest all-night party. In a twist of history, officers
stormed the citizenry to break it up.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had observed on French
television that human rights originated in ancient Greece and were
affirmed in England's Magna Carta of 1215.
   She called the French Revolution a reign of terror that
contributed little to humanity.
   When Mrs. Thatcher appeared among other dignitaries on giant
screens off the Champs-Elysees, crowds booed.
   But mostly, Paris was a raucous party. People wore silly hats,
bought tricolored underwear and gave little serious thought to
history books.
   The Seine flowed thick with champagne corks, beer cans and other
debris of revelry.
   The well-connected had dinner at dawn with Ms. Norman and singer
Grace Jones at Le Palace. Others simply found the nearest music and
did anything from funky chicken to fox-trot.
   Sometimes, the mood turned ugly as young toughs threw
firecrackers at people's feet or dropped gas bombs into crowds as
thick as bearnaise sauce.
   But many Parisians said they had not seen such gaiety, color and
unabashed outpouring of national pride since 1944, when Allied
forces joined French troops in liberating Paris.
   As the weekend wound down, Mitterrand's chauffeur set out on a
personal mission to carry France's message across the world. He is
leading a convoy of Renault vans to Tokyo, via Moscow.
   Three bear the names associated with the French Revolution since
1789: Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood. The fourth is named Hope.

   French President Francois Mitterrand on Saturday
gave the summit leaders a personal guided tour of his pet project _
12th century ruins discovered beneath the Louvre.
   After their first full day of talks came to an end under the
Pyramid, the avant-garde glass structure that sits in the Louvre's
Napoleon Courtyard, Mitterand guided his guests from the underground
meeting site and into the excavated ruins under the museum.
   The 8-meter-high moat walls and guard towers are all that remains
of the castle fortress of French King Philippe-Auguste.
   Construction of the Louvre was begun in the 16th century on top
of the medieval fortress, of which only an 80-square-meter section
survives.
   The relic of medieval Paris is dear to Mitterrand's heart,
officials said, because it was only discovered during the
excavations to build the complex underneath the architecturally
controversial Pyramid.
   Both Mitterrand and his culture minister, Jack Lang, were roundly
criticized for plunking down the gleaming glass Pyramid in the
Napoleon Courtyard of the austere U-shaped Louvre, the world's
largest royal palace, and now one of the world's most famous museums.
   ``Mr. Mitterrand loves this place,'' said Evelyne Richard, a
spokeswoman for the French president. ``The construction of the
pyramid began in 1983, and the works were delayed because of this
find.''
   While Mitterrand led the way down a subterranean boardwalk in the
dry moat bed, France's director of museums, Michel Laclotte,
explained the history of the fortress to West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, President George Bush and Prime Ministers Margaret
Thatcher of Britain, Suosuke Uno of Japan, Ciriaco Mita of Italy and
Brian Mulroney of Canada.
   Mitterrand, his guests, and their interpreters then crowded into
a dimly lit antechamber where there is a display of artifacts
discovered during the excavation.
   A cacophony of languages echoed off the concrete walls as the
translators struggled to keep pace with Laclotte's explanations, and
the Western leaders asked questions.
   Among the finds were a golden fragment of the crown of the late
medieval King Charles VI.
   After the tour, Mitterrand led his guests into the Louvre for
champagne and hors d'oeuvres, as the setting sun streamed through
the windows of the palace on the Seine. The setting for the cocktail
session was a recently opened gallery of Greek and Roman statuary,
which the summit leaders toured as they chatted.

   It will be several months before a natural gas
refinery that exploded in flames last week will return to full
operations, state television said Saturday.
   Four people were killed and six injured in Wednesday's blast and
fire at the refinery in Almetyevsk in central Russia. The evening
news show Vremya said Saturday that houses in the nearby village of
Makhtama also were damaged.
   A government inquiry blamed the explosion on a propane gas leak,
the official news agency Tass said earlier.
   Almetyevsk is about 500 miles east of Moscow in the Tatar
Autonomous Republic.
   The republic's deputy premier, M.G. Sabirov, told Vremya it will
take several months to repair damage at the refinery.
   News reports did not indicate if the accident would affect Soviet
gas exports.
   Last month, a gas pipeline leaked and exploded as two passenger
trains were passing in the Soviet Ural Mountains. More than 600
people were killed.

   A misguided Cessna 182 turned out to be
the only show in town for thousands of people gathered for the first
flight of the B-2 stealth bomber Saturday. The Cessna, at least, got
off the ground.
   Brian Green, a 35-year-old schoolteacher from Porterville,
apparently got lost over the Mojave Desert while out for spin with
his niece and nephew, Kris and Sarah Erickson, authorities said.
   He landed the rented plane on the tarmac of Air Force Plant 42
just as the stealth bomber was ready to taxi for its maiden flight.
While the children watched aghast, security agents swooped in and
frisked and handcuffed Green.
   ``We just got lost,'' said Kris, 9.``My uncle was being arrested
and we were right with him and it was scary.''
   ``They flew down to pick me up in Agua Dulce. They made a slight
detour, I guess,'' said the youngsters' father, Steve Erickson of
Santa Clarita. Agua Dulce is about 10 miles southwest of the air
base in Palmdale, which neighbors Lancaster.
   Green received his pilot's license three years ago and it was the
first time he had attempted the flight from Tulare Airport in
central California to Agua Dulce in the southern part of the state,
said Erickson, who picked up his children at a Los Angeles County
sheriff's substation here.
   Sheriff's Lt. Tom Pigott said Green was booked for investigation
of misdemeanor trespassing and was later released on his own
recognizance.
   ``Mr. Green was very cooperative at the scene and he gave his
consent for the plane to be searched and nothing unusual or
subversive was found,'' said Pigott, who was on the tarmac as part
of the security force.
   As it turned out, a low fuel gauge reading prompted officials to
postpone Saturday's planned flight of the B-2, disappointing
thousands of aviation buffs who gathered outside the air base.
   The unexpected arrival of the stray Cessna played no role in the
decision to scrub the flight, said Air Force Col. Douglas Kennett.

   Vice President Dan Quayle mistakenly
credited a moon landing to a congressman convicted of a sex charge,
amusing a crowd of Young Republicans at the group's national
convention Saturday.
   ``This next Thursday, July 20th, will be an historic date for
America as America celebrates the 20th anniversary of Neil Armstrong
and Buz Lukens walking on the moon,'' Quayle said.
   He meant to say Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin, who followed Armstrong to
become the second person to walk on the moon on the Apollo 11
mission.
   Donald ``Buz'' Lukens, a Republican congressman from Ohio, was
convicted in May of having sex with a 16-year-old girl.
   Lukens, 58, was sentenced last month in Columbus to 30 days in
jail and fined $500 on the misdemeanor charge of contributing to the
unruliness of a minor. He is free on bond pending appeal.
   Quayle, who spoke from index cards during remarks at the
Nashville Convention Center, appeared to realize his mistake after
the crowd began laughing at the reference to Lukens. The vice
president did not correct himself but did exchange glances with his
wife, Marilyn, who was also on the stage.
   GOP Chairman Lee Atwater said he decided not to mention the gaffe
when he spoke to Quayle later, but the vice president brought it up.
   ``He said, `Buz Lukens, oooh,''' Atwater said, grimacing in
imitation of Quayle.
   The convention of about 1,200 Young Republicans began Friday and
ends Sunday.

   New tests confirmed that the crippled tanker
Exxon Valdez is leaking crude oil as it sits offshore in rough seas,
but the oil is decomposing, the Coast Guard said Saturday.
   ``We do have some very weathered and degraded traces of crude oil
in the slick,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg. ``There's also
heavy concentrations of organic components.''
   Microorganisms and plankton made up some of the organic compounds
found with the crude, Solberg said. More tests are being conducted
to determine the toxicity of the materials.
   Exxon officials Saturday insisted the releases from the damaged
tanker were small and posed no environmental threat.
   ``There is no significant pollution. There has been no
significant pollution,'' Exxon Shipping Co. president Frank Iarossi
said at a joint news briefing held by Exxon and the Coast Guard in
San Diego. ``There is no oil in the water.''
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 in Alaska and spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   The tanker was cleaned and towed 2,500 miles to California for
extensive repairs to its shredded hull. It has been barred from
entering port, however, because five steel plates that peeled from
the ship's frame during the voyage must be cut off before it can fit
through the bay channel.
   The rough seas Saturday apparently tore loose a sixth steel slab
from the hull framing, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Don Montoro.
   A state wildlife official disputed Iarossi's assessment of the
slick and said state agencies will demand that the vessel be free of
any discharge before being brought into state waters for repairs.
   ``I don't want any vessel to discharge oil, not this one or any
other,'' said Reed Smith, pollution response officer in San Diego
for the state Department of Fish and Game. ``It's harmful to marine
organisms.''
   Iarossi said Exxon would comply with state and federal demands,
and welcomed the new tests.
   ``We're going through a process that will hopefully reduce the
level of concern by the state agencies and the public,'' he said.
``It's a process that we have to go through. `I can't come barging
in here and say, `I want to bring my ship in.' ''
   The new round of tests were ordered after the Coast Guard and
state Fish and Game Department arrived at different conclusions
after analyzing one of the sheens created off the coast of San Diego.
   Wildlife officials concluded the 18-mile-long slick contained
traces of petroleum products, but the Coast Guard tests determined
it consisted of unidentified organic matter and was oil-free.
   The discrepancy prompted a second test by the Coast Guard.
   The tests were conducted on samples from the slick spotted near
the Valdez when it arrived off the San Diego coast Monday.
   The ship, about 60 miles offshore, is still discharging a small
amount of a blue-brown slick into the water, Solberg said. But it
has been confined to the immediate area of the ship and dissipated
rapidly.
   Meanwhile, sea conditions have worsened in the area and the
Valdez crew, along with the tugboat towing it, were trying to move
the vessel to a new position to better withstand the 10-foot swells
and six-foot seas, he said.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp on Friday filed a
precautionary lawsuit Friday in San Diego Superior Court which seeks
to ensure that the tanker remains outside California waters until
officials are satisfied it's free of toxic materials.
   Although Exxon Shipping Co. has shown a willingness to cooperate,
Van de Kamp said he filed the lawsuit to ensure the existence of
``an enforcement mechanism for whatever agreement we are able to
reach with Exxon.''
   Exxon spokeswoman Jan Cool declined to comment on the state's
action, saying company officials hadn't yet been able to review it.

   New assurances from Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir on Israel's commitment to Palestinian elections prompted the
Bush administration to cancel a delegation to Jerusalem, Secretary
of State James A. Baker III said Saturday.
   Shamir gave assurances that his commitment had not changed ``one
iota,'' Baker told reporters at a news briefing .
   Before that ``we had some genuine concern, frankly, that perhaps
as a result of the action by the Likud party, they were in a sense
devaluing their own initiative,'' Baker said.
   Shamir's Likud party, in a move that disappointed Baker and
senior State Department aides, two weeks ago adopted a hardline
stand against yielding any territory or establishing a Palestinian
state on the West Bank or in Gaza.
   Baker reacted by mapping plans to send several of his closest
aides to Jerusalem to see if Shamir still planned to go ahead with
the elections in a way approved by the Israeli coalition cabinet in
May.
   The move by Likud threatened to split the Israeli government, but
the coalition subsequently repaired the rift and Shamir signaled to
Washington that the May decision stood.
   Baker, who accompanied President Bush to the annual seven-nation
economic summit, said it still might be useful to send a U.S.
delegation to Jerusalem at some point but not right now ``because
Prime Minister Shamir himself has made a number of statements that
the initiative has not changed one iota.''
   Besides, Baker said, ``the national unity government there
appears to be working together very hard to reconfirm their
commitment to the election process.''

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the world's seven richest industrial
nations, striving to project a united front, voiced support Saturday
for democracy behind the Iron Curtain and condemned repression in
China during a gathering that even attracted the attention of Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   In a surprising development, the leader of the Soviet Union
called on the summit chiefs to link his country's economy to their
own.
   The extraordinary appeal became the principal subject of
discussion at the summit leaders' dinner meeting, according to
French spokesman Hubert Vedrine. He called Gorbachev's letter
totally unexpected.
   Aside from the Soviet leader's appeal, the economic summit was so
harmonious the world leaders decided to end their three-day meeting
several hours earlier than scheduled Sunday, the first time any of
the 15 annual gatherings was cut short.
   The letter from Gorbachev was read to the leaders by French
President Francois Mitterrand. Gorbachev said it ``is obvious that
the rest of the world can only gain by the opening to the world
economy of a market such as that of the Soviet Union.''
   He petitioned the West to consider the reforms he is making in
the communist Soviet economy and to let his country play a larger
role in world economic affairs.
   Any disputes that did occur among the leaders of the United
States, France, West Germany, Japan, Britain, Italy and Canada were
either papered over or ignored as the summit nations issued a
political communique Saturday.
   The second day of discussions was held on the 35th floor of the
Grand Arch, an avant-garde marble and glass office building offering
a spectacular view of Paris.
   Secretary of State James Baker, in a briefing for reporters,
called his ninth consecutive summit ``the most harmonious and one of
the most productive summits that I have attended.''
   The rich nations were lavish in their encouragement for political
and economic reforms in Poland and Hungary, but they did not back up
the kind words with any specific commitment of money.
   But Bush indicated that he was pleased with the support provided
by his fellow summit leaders, saying the commitments they made had
``vindicated'' his approach to fostering economic and political
reforms in the communist East bloc.
   Bush attended the summit at the end of a history-making trip to
Poland and Hungary, where he unveiled a $140 million package of aid
to the two nations.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said that all of the
summit nations were ``very anxious to help. We are all helping, each
in our own way.''
   The annual economic gathering was interspersed between the pomp
and pageantry of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
Mitterrand, who considers himself a champion of Third World causes,
invited more than two dozen leaders of developing countries to rub
shoulders with the Summit Seven during the festivities.
   But the French president gave up an effort to get his summit
partners to endorse a call for a North-South summit between rich and
poor countries to address the economic plight of poor countries.
   The summit will conclude Sunday with a round of meetings and the
issuance of a final communique, expected to focus on such issues as
Third World debt and a pledge to clean up global pollution.
   At the urging of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the document
on political issues was amended Saturday at the last minute to
include a proposal to convene an emergency meeting within the next
few weeks to deal with the ``urgent need for food assistance'' for
Poland.
   Officials said the session could be used as the launching pad for
a massive foodlift to shortage-plagued Poland.
   European nations are currently stockpiling surplus meat, sugar,
grain and some dairy products that could be used to ease the
economic difficulties of the Poles.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, briefing reporters,
said that it was envisioned that the conference would organize both
food and cash contributions for Poland but it was unclear just how
much food aid would be forthcoming.
   The leaders also reaffirmed their support for easing Poland's $39
billion foreign debt burden but skipped specifics on how much
relaxation in the repayment schedule they were willing to finance.
   On China, the seven democracies called on Beijing to ``cease
action against those who have done no more than claim their
legitimate rights to democracy and liberty'' but the leaders stopped
short of announcing any stiffer sanctions in response to the bloody
crackdown on dissent.
   In his letter to the summit gathering, Gorbachev called for
increased East-West cooperation on economic matters saying such
links would prove beneficial to both sides.
   ``Our perestroika (restructuring) is inseparable from the policy
tending toward full and entire participation in the world economy,''
wrote Gorbachev.
   The summit leaders, while not responding directly to Gorbachev's
message, expressed their approval for easing East-West tensions but
said Moscow ``remains a threat to each of us'' because of a military
balance that favors the Communist bloc.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that the Soviet
letter was read by Mitterrand during the leaders' afternoon session
and that the Bush administration was generally supportive of
Gorbachev's proposals for greater economic coordination.
   The leaders also condemned international terrorism and vowed to
bring terrorists to justice.
   They called for stepped up international efforts to protect
against aircraft hijackings and sabotage in the wake of the bombing
of Pan Am flight 103 that killed 270 people in Lockerbie, Scotland,
last December.
   In a clear reference to Iran and its allies in Lebanon, the
leaders called ``on those holding hostages to release them
immediately and unconditionally and on those with influence over
hostage-takers to use it to this end.''

<TEXT>
   An attorney for a woman charged with
killing her 6-week-old daughter and claiming the infant was abducted
has asked for a gag order and change of venue for the woman's trial.
   Paula Sims is also accused of concealing the 1986 death of her
first daughter, 13-day-old Loralei, whom she reported abducted under
circumstances similar to the disappearance of 6-week-old Heather in
April.
   After a hearing Friday on other charges against Mrs. Sims in
Heather's death, attorney Donald E. Groshong filed motions asking
that the murder trial be moved from Madison County because of news
coverage. He's also seeking to have police and prosecutors barred
from publicly discussing the case.
   A ruling on the motions is expected at a hearing scheduled July
21 on the murder charge against Mrs. Sims.
   Mrs. Sims, 30, has denied any wrongdoing.
   At Friday's hearing, Madison County Associate Judge Ellar
Duffwilliams ordered Mrs. Sims to stand trial on charges of
obstructing justice and concealing Heather's death. Mrs. Sims was
charged with murder in that death on Tuesday.
   In the case of both disappearences, Mrs. Sims reported that a
masked gunman abducted the baby girls while her husband, Robert, was
away at work. Police say they have found no evidence to support her
assertion and consider the couple the prime suspects.
   Robert Sims has not been charged in either case, and the only
murder charge against his wife is in Heather's death. An autopsy
showed that Heather's body had been frozen before it was dumped in a
trash can on May 3, four days after Mrs. Sims reported her daughter
kidnapped.

   A group of 17 women bared their breasts
in front of the national Women's Hall of Fame on Saturday to protest
a state law that prohibits women from going shirtless in public.
   The women marched to the museum and gave speeches before taking
off their shirts in front of about 200 people during an annual
convention commemorating the birth of the women's movement here.
   Local police and state troopers stood by during the
demonstration, but no arrests were made. The women bared their
breasts for about two minutes, then put their shirts back on and
left.
   The protest came nearly three weeks after ten members of the
group were arrested in Rochester for baring their breasts on a
beach. They're scheduled to appear in city court on Aug. 1 to answer
charges of exposure of person, a violation, to which they've pleaded
innocent.
   Ramona Santorelli, one of the women who participated in the
protest, said the group, called the Coalition for Topfree Equality,
wanted to make the statement that rules against shirtless women were
discriminatory.
   ``I think that people are making the connection, the deeper
issues. We're not just exposing our breasts. We're exposing the
sexual issues, the inequality,'' Santorelli said.
   Santorelli said an agreement had been made with the Seneca Falls
chief of police that he would give the group two warnings before
making any arrests.
   A spokeswoman at the Hall of Fame said the museum had no
connection with the women.

Brooklyn on Friday, police said, and handed a teller a note saying,
``Be fast. I have a gun. ... Give me all your money. ... Don't make
me pull it.''
   The teller gave him $2,100, which Colella put in a paper bag
before fleeing on foot, police said. Moments later, he was thrown to
the ground by a man who took the money and fled in a station wagon,
said Detective Sgt. Timothy Dowd.
   Colella went to the local precinct. ``The suspect surrendered to
the desk lieutenant and implicated himself in the bank robbery,''
Dowd said, and provided a description of his attacker.
   ``Only a psychiatrist would know why he did it,'' said another
police spokesman, Sgt. Norris Hollomon.
   Colella was charged with first-degree robbery and criminal
possession of stolen property and a weapon. The station wagon mugger
has not been found.

<HEAD>Jazz Record Producer Dies at 71</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nesuhi Ertegun, who for 50 years brought jazz to
the public through records, radio and jam sessions, died Saturday of
complications following a cancer operation. He was 71.
   Ertegun died at Mount Sinai Hospital, said his brother, Ahmet
Ertegun, the founder and head of Atlantic Records.
   Ertegun joined his brother's firm as head of the LP and Jazz
divisions in 1954 and was responsible for signing and producing such
acts as the Modern Jazz Quartet, John Coltrane, Thelonius Monk and
Charlie Mingus.
   He also signed Roberta Flack to Atlantic and produced recordings
with Ray Charles, Bobby Darin and The Drifters.
   He left that position in 1969 and two years later started WEA
International, which distributes outside the United States all of
the music products of Warner Brothers Records, Atlantic Records,
Elektra Records and MCA Records. He retired in 1987.
   Ertegun was the first president of the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences, which oversees the annual Grammy
awards, and served as chairman of the International Federation of
Phonographic Industries, which represents recording companies in
copyrighting.
   Born in Istanbul, Turkey, Ertegun came to the United States in
1939 with his father, M. Munir Ertegun, who was the Turkish
ambassador in Washington.
   Ertegun held weekly jam sessions at the Turkish Embassy, which
were attended by such artists as Lester Young, Teddy Wilson and
Sidney Bechet.
   He also served as musical collaborator on radio programs produced
by Orson Welles, and was responsible for the inclusion of Jimmy
Noon's New Orleans music on Welles' shows.
   He is survived by his wife, Selma, two children, and a sister.

<HEAD>Jordan's King Condemns Israeli Peace Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Hussein of Jordan on Saturday rejected the
Israeli peace plan for the occupied territories, saying it did not
represent the goals of Palestinians.
   The plan ``is obviously, as it is, totally unacceptable,''
Hussein said in an interview on Channel 4's ``World This Week''
program. ``It denies the Palestinians everything they aspire to
achieve.''
   ``I believe that Israel must be persuaded to review its position,
and it is the duty of Israel's friends the world over ... to save
Israel from Israel, and save all of us as a result,'' Hussein said.
   Under the plan, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip would elect representatives to negotiate a peace settlement
with Israel.
   Earlier this month, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel
accepted several hard-line conditions set by his right-wing Likud
bloc, including an end to the 19-month uprising in the territories
before negotiations begin. Another condition is that Jews would be
allowed to continue settling in the occupied lands.
   The conditions angered the left-of-center Labor Party, which
shares power with Likud in a coalition government. Labor has said
the conditions virtually kill the proposal because they are
unacceptable to Palestinians.

<TEXT>
   A clerk at historic Christ Church discovered
large underground vaults containing caskets and evidence of
long-forgotten catacombs under a courtyard where America's founders
walked to worship.
   ``We knew there were graves down there,'' Bruce Cooper Gill, the
church's clerk of the works, said Friday after his discovery at the
262-year-old church where the Episcopal Church was formed in 1789.
   Although church officials assumed that several people were
probably buried in vaults that appeared to hold only one person, the
size of the vaults surprised Gill, he said.
   ``They were a lot bigger than anyone imagined,'' he said,
describing them as the size of a Victorian bedroom, slightly larger
than 10 feet square.
   One vault, bearing the family names of Binney and Cox, held 10
cedar caskets, some thinned by deterioration, making skeletal
remains visible.
   Another vault, carved with the name of the John Waller James,
rector for a month in 1836, contained four or five lead caskets.
   No one has been buried since 1949 in a family vault at the
church, which was built between 1727 and 1754, Gill said.
   Five signers of the Declaration of Independence are buried at the
church, which is part of Independence National Historical Park and
is considered one of the nation's finest examples of Colonial
architecture.

   A two-minute test of an experimental
space shuttle engine went flawlessly Saturday at the NASA's Marshall
Space Flight Center after two earlier tests had to be shut down
abruptly, authorities said.
   An ear-piercing roar and huge clouds of white smoke rolled across
the test site at Marshall, followed by the applause of some 1,000
people who got a rare opportunity to watch the test. Marshall opened
its gates to the public to mark the 20th anniversary of man landing
on the moon, a mission that used rocket engines designed at Marshall.
   ``It went perfectly,'' Marshall Director Jack Lee said.
   NASA engineers said data from the test would be analyzed by
computers. They also said the engine's experimental enlarged throat
for the main combustion chamber may be a feature of space shuttles
by 1995.
   The throat is designed to allow the engine to run at lower
pressures and temperatures than now exist on the space shuttle.
   The last test on June 22 was automatically shut down after 40
seconds because nitrogen contaminated the engine's liquid hydrogen
system.

<TEXT>
   Two attackers raided a Mormon chapel in
this Santiago suburb Saturday, set it on fire and left pamphlets of
a leftist guerrilla group, authorities said.
   No one was injured in the attack, the second this month on a
Mormon chapel in La Florida.
   In the previous attack on July 7, seven assailants interrupted a
chapel gathering, forced the missionary to undress and then fled. No
one was injured; church officials later said the attackers may have
wanted simply to humiliate the missionary.
   Police said they have made no arrests in either attack.
   Leftist guerrillas have a history of making such attacks in
recent years. They say the Mormon Church, based in Salt Lake City,
Utah, is a force for U.S. imperialism.
   In Saturday's predawn attack, the two men brandished pistols and
told the watchman Celestino Gonzalez, ``This is a robbery,''
Gonzalez said.
   However, he said, they then poured a flammable liquid on the
wooden chapel, which is about 40 feet long, and set it on fire
before fleeing. Gonzalez said he put out the fire himself.
   The pamphlets the attackers left behind were from a small group
of urban radicals known as the Lautaro Rebel Front.
   That same group claimed responsibility for the earlier attack in
La Florida.
   The Mormon Church in Chile had no immediate comment on Saturday's
attack.
   A church spokesman said after earlier incidents that most of the
approximately 250 Mormon missionaries in the country are Chilean. He
said only a very small number are American.
   In May in La Paz, Bolivia, two Mormon missionaries from Utah were
shot and killed as they returned to their apartment. A group known
as the Armed Liberation Front of Zarate Willka claimed
responsibility.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Saturday denied custody of an 18-month-old
girl to the couple accused of paying $1,100 and a plane ticket for
her.
   Dade Circuit Judge Frederick N. Barad also denied custody of
Crystal Lynn DeMetro to her maternal grandparents, saying they were
unfit to take care of her, and returned the case to Juvenile Court.
   ``All four contestants for this child are in need of
psychotherapy. They all have personality disorders,'' Barad said in
a nine-page ruling.
   Judy and Richard DeMetro, accused of buying the girl, tried to
gain legal custody of Crystal after the state Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services asked that she be given to her maternal
grandparents.
   The DeMetros allegedly gave Crystal's natural mother Camara
Heistand a total of $1,100 in $100 bills, clothing, a box of candy
and a plan ticket and went through an elaborate name-change ruse
with the mother's cooperation.
   ``In summary, the DeMetros spun a web of deceit, and the court
cannot permit the child to be caught in that web,'' Barad said.
   ``I'm very disappointed, and I want my baby back,'' said Judy
DeMetro, wiping away tears and walking away from reporters.
   HRS spokesman Michael Powers said, ``Basically, it goes back to
the beginning, except in a different arena.''
   Crystal's fate now rests with the county Juvenile Court, which
will determine if she should become a ward of the state and become
eligible for adoption. She will remain in a foster home where she
has lived since the judge took Crystal away from the DeMetros in
Miami in June.
   No one has been excluded as adoptive parents.
   The grandparents, Chad and Carol Dornsife, of South Lake Tahoe,
Calif., began a nationwide search for Crystal after learning their
granddaughter had been given up in 1987.
   The Dornsifes claim the DeMetros are gypsies and their life style
is inappropriate for Crystal.
   ``Simply, the Dornsifes have not demonstrated that they could
provide the necessary care, attention, shelter and a moral
environment that would be conducive to and serve the best interests
of Crystal,'' the judge said.
   The mother doesn't want the child, and the father is unknown.
   Lester Langer, a Miami attorney representing the Dornsifes, said
the judge's order was incorrect but expected. He called the order a
partial victory because it allows the Dornsifes more time to present
their case for adoption.

<HEAD>D.C., Maryland Housing Officials Say Developers Boasted Inside Track
to HUD</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and local housing officials in and around
the nation's capital say developers increasingly asserted they had
connections in the Reagan administration that would guarantee scarce
federal housing funds, a published report says.
   ``They'd say, if D.C. needs the units, this is the only way to
get them,'' said Alphonso Jackson, public housing director for the
District of Columbia in 1987 and 1988.
   ``I said, `I will not put the city manager or the mayor in a
position to be haunted by this,''' Jackson told The Washington Post.
   Sunday's edition of The Post reports that developers seeking
funds through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's
moderate rehabiltation program often dropped the names of
high-ranking government officials like then-assistant secretary for
housing Thomas Demery, and former Interior Secretary James Watt.
   Several federal housing programs have been under scrutiny by HUD,
the Justice Department and Congress for alleged mismanagement and
fraud.
   ``It was public knowledge that if you were wired in as a
Republican, you got funding,'' Jackson told the newspaper.
   He said local housing directors, the mayors or the city councils
shouldn't be blamed because ``they figure they may not be following
the rules, but they are addressing the need.''
   Trudy McFall, Maryland's communiy development administrator, said
there was no question that the state received funds that had been
steered.
   Under the moderate rehabilitation program, local housing
authorities, not individual developers, were to apply to federal
funds. Developers then were to offer competitive proposals for
project funding.
   However, McFall said developer Judith Siegel correctly told her
of changes in HUD procedures in 1987 that would qualify Maryland for
previously denied funds. Siegel told her of the changes before HUD
notified the state, McFall said.
   McFall said Siegel claimed she received her information from
Demery.
   Siegel, who the newspaper said could not be reached for comment,
has testified before a congressional subcommittee that she paid Watt
$300,000 in consulting fees for the Kingsley Park development
project in Essex, Md. Both Watt and Seigel said their actions were
legal.
   The HUD inspector general in April issued a highly critical
report saying top HUD officials created a ``perception'' of
favoritism in the moderate rehabilitation program.

   Twenty years after man walked on the
moon, those responsible for that ``one giant leap for mankind'' said
the space program needs another bold challenge to recapture
America's imagination.
   And with America's imagination, they said, will come the
financial support needed for a daring project, such as landing
astronauts on Mars.
   On Saturday, a soldout crowd of more than 4,000 people joined the
Apollo 11 crew _ Neil Armstrong, Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin and Michael
Collins _ at the Alabama Space and Rocket Center for the first of
four celebrations around the country to commemorate the lunar
landing on July 20, 1969.
   Huntsville's celebration focuses on the role this northern
Alabama city and the Wernher von Braun rocket team at NASA's
Marshall Space Flight Center played in developing the Saturn V
rocket to propel Apollo 11 on its journey to the moon.
   The celebration was like a high-tech rock concert without the
music. Lasers bounced off rockets exhibited throughout the center,
sound effects simulated the takeoff of the Saturn V rocket to the
moon, and actors portrayed Armstrong's and Aldrin's walk on the
rugged lunar landscape four days after blasting off from Kennedy
Space Center.
   It climaxed with the Apollo 11 crew rising from a cloud of smoke
20 feet into the air to the front of a giant movie screen showing
footage of their travels. The crew was surrounded by a cacophony of
fireworks and dozens of dancing laser beams.
   Aldrin, who spent much of his time in Huntsville autographing his
new book ``Men from Earth,'' describes the 20th anniversary as
``bittersweet.'' That's because he worries that America ``will sink
to second-rate status'' in space if it continues on its present
course.
   The 59-year-old former astronaut said Saturday he hoped the
anniversary would help America set well-defined space objectives
instead of having each space shuttle flight ``being an entity into
itself.''
   ``There is an excitement about the past but there is not an
awareness of where we want to go,'' he said in an interview.
   He envisions the United States working with the Soviet Union and
Japan on space research projects, with a goal of developing
spaceships that will take advantage of planetary movements to
slingshot between Mars and Earth on five-month cycles.
   Collins, 58, also called for greater direction in the space
program.
   ``One of these days, and I hope it's not too long, this country
is going to decide it wants to go to Mars,'' he told a gathering of
engineers who worked on the Apollo project.
   Armstrong, 58, told the same group, ``A machine is man-made and
hence imperfect. No one has ever made a perfect machine. Those of
you who made the Saturn V came about as close as history ever
recorded.''
   Jack Lee, director at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville
and a former member of the von Braun team, vividly remembers
President Kennedy's seemingly impossible challenge to land a man on
the moon by the end of the 1960s.
   No president has issued an equally bold challenge since then, but
he hopes President Bush will in a 20th anniversary speech Thursday.
   ``We must continue what Wernher von Braun and Apollo 11 started
many years ago, that is to reach out and touch another world,'' he
said. ``This time our launching pad is going to be the space
station.''
   Konrad Dannenberg, a German rocket scientist who came to America
with Von Braun after World War II and later supervised engineering
and testing of the Saturn rocket, said the moon landing ``was the
biggest step for mankind that has ever taken place. I hope this
(anniversary) is the first step toward an even bigger achievement.''
   Ed Buckbee, director of the Space and Rocket Center, a tourist
attraction focused on space achievements, and a former member of Von
Braun's staff, said he hopes ``President Bush gives us a goal. I've
heard everything from a moon colony to a man on Mars, with a space
plane in there.''
   Buckbee said he sees only one way for NASA to recapture America's
imagination and pocketbook.
   ``It's got to be a man on Mars landing,'' he said. ``I don't
think a space station is going to capture American imagination. It's
got to be something that puts man and machine against the hazards of
space.''

   Trans World Airlines, responding to a lawsuit and
complaints from homosexuals, has agreed to allow frequent flier
credit to be transferred to any companion, not just relatives.
   Members of TWA's frequent flier program are being notified of the
new policy in a mailing now under way, The New York Times reported
in Sunday's editions.
   The airline had required people who earned free tickets to use
the tickets themselves or transfer them to relatives, in an attempt
to prevent people from selling or bartering tickets.
   The airline was sued in federal court by lawyers from the Lambda
Legal Defense and Education Fund in May, charging discrimination.
   ``What we have now done is to expand the policy so that virtually
any frequent flier can travel with any companion of their
choosing,'' said Mark Buckstein, the airline's general counsel. ``We
felt our rules had probably been unduly restrictive.''
   Gay groups said TWA was the last major airline to drop its
limiting policy, the Times reported.
   The lawsuit, tentatively settled, said William L. Johnson, a New
York lawyer, was denied a ticket in July 1988 for his live-in
companion of seven years. His lawyer, Evan Wolfson, would not
disclose terms of the settlement. Airline officials said the
settlement wasn't final.
   ``When TWA was forced to pay attention to what it was doing, they
realized it was bad business and they changed it,'' Wolfson said.

   Teiichi Suzuki, a former army general who helped
plan Japan's economy during World War II and the last survivor of 28
Japanese leaders convicted of war crimes, died of heart failure
Saturday. He was 100.
   Suzuki, as a lieutenant general in the Imperial Army, was the
primary planner of Japan's wartime economy, serving as state
minister of the Planning Board from 1941 to 1943.
   Following Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945, Suzuki stood
trial along with wartime Prime Minister Hideki Tojo and other
Japanese leaders. Suzuki was given a life sentence but was paroled
in 1955 and fully pardoned in 1958.
   Seven of the 28 were condemned and hanged Dec. 23, 1948,
including Tojo, who bungled a suicide attempt when he was about to
be arrested. Five died in prison and the others were paroled,
eventually dying of old age or illness.
   Suzuki, after briefly returning to government service following
his pardon, dropped from public view and refused to meet reporters.

   The military wants to buy 132 of the aircraft. The stealth bomber
is designed to evade Soviet radar but has yet to fly. If successful,
the jet could force the Soviets to totally revamp their air defense
system at a cost far exceeding the price tag on the B-2, Nunn said.

   The fate of Paramount Communications Inc.'s
hostile $12.2 billion bid for Time Inc. rests with the Delaware
Supreme Court after a judge refused to block Time's $14 billion
tender offer for Warner Communications Inc.
   The Supreme Court agreed late Friday to hear the case after
Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen turned down a request by
Paramount and some of Time's biggest shareholders for an injunction
against Time's bid for Warner.
   Allen halted Time's $70 a share offer, which had been scheduled
to expire at midnight Monday, for 10 days to give Paramount time to
appeal his ruling. If Paramount loses, it will pave the way for Time
and Warner to merge, forming Time Warner Inc., the world's largest
communications concern.
   Paramount, which is offering $200 a share for Time, has said it
would not pursue a buyout of Time Warner.

<HEAD>Red Necks in Red Square: Texans Hitch Up with Soviet Space Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To meet growing demand for satellite launch
services, a new deal has been struck between two great superpowers _
the Soviet Union and Texas.
   A joint venture agreement gives a group of Texas entrepreneurs
exclusive rights to market products and services of the Soviet space
agency, Glavkosmos, in the United States.
   ``The Soviets couldn't be nicer. You couldn't ask for better
bunch of partners,'' said Buck Hightower, a founder of the
Houston-based Space Commerce Corp., which is selling everything from
official Glavkosmos T-shirts to launch services for U.S. satellite
companies wanting to hitch a ride on a Soviet Proton rocket.
   During a break from overseeing a crowded T-shirt stand at the
entrance to the U.S.S.R. Pavilion at the Paris Air Show in mid-June,
Hightower recalled how a group of Texas red necks found themselves
doing business on Red Square.
   ``We were trying to sell some idle oilfield equipment to the
Soviets,'' Hightower said, adding that the Texas good ol' boy
network led him to Arthur Dula, a Houston aerospace attorney and
former NASA consultant who had broad Moscow contacts. ``We got to
know the neighbors.''
   Glasnost was booming, U.S. rocket companies were unable to meet
American business' demand for launch services, ``so we decided to
engage in a little creative international trade,'' Hightower said.
   They rang Alexandr Dunayev, head of Glavkosmos, ``who thought it
was a fine idea,'' Hightower said. The high sheriffs at the U.S.
State Department weren't so sure.
   Dula, now president of Space Commerce, wanted the Soviet rocket
to blast off from a U.S. site carrying the first payload, two
communications satellites for Hughes Aircraft.
   The State Department said no way.
   The Texans then decided to launch from the Soviet Union. Under
the Reagan administration, the State Department denied an export
license to Hughes.
   Under the Bush administration, the Texans have found a more
receptive State Department and they plan to apply for another export
license soon, Dula said in a telephone interview from Houston this
past week.
   If the license is denied again, his Texas company will launch the
Soviet rocket from another country such as Australia or Brazil and
will haul a payload containing no American parts. The fee for a ride
on the Red rocket is about $30 million.
   Besides T-shirts and rockets, Space Commerce also offers a range
of other Soviet space agency services, including navigational aids
and flights aboard the space station Mir.
   Moreover, Space Commerce can write contracts for advertisers who
want to proclaim their product or service on the side of a Soviet
rocket. The Soviets disclosed recently that they want to exploit
commercial opportunities that their space program has created,
including putting ads in space, seen by millions of television
viewers during blastoffs.
   In addition, Space Commerce soon plans to conduct tours to Soviet
space facilities never before open to the public _ American or
Soviet.
   Tourists will be able to visit the Mission Control Center at
Kaliningrad near Moscow, or Star City, where cosmonauts train, with
sidetrips to the Bolshoi Ballet and the Moscow Circus.
   ``Our feeling is that there must be a place in the world economy
for the Soviet Union,'' said Hightower, who also heads an Austin
property development company.
   During the air show last month, the Space Commerce partners did a
brisk business selling T-shirts, mostly to American visitors.
   Approached quietly by a gray-haired man in a business suit,
partner Robert R. Brandes said: ``No sir, just T-shirts here. The
back part is where they're selling the rockets.''

<HEAD>Tax Tide Appears to be Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the tax tide begins rising, as it now may
be, public protest seems to be as ineffectual a weapon as a broom
swishing against another tide, the one that comes in from the oceans.
   But don't lose heart. You cannot afford to. You can say no to
taxes, says Thomas Humbert, an economic scholar. He already has,
loudly and succinctly.
   Whether his message, delivered to the National Economic
Commission, has had much of an impact is difficult to say, but it
shouldn't be forgotten, because months later his points remain
meaningful.
   Humbert, a fellow in political economy at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank that was influential in the
Reagan administration and still carries clout at the White House,
lists seven reasons for saying no.
   Tax increases, he says, hurt economic growth, undermine tax
equity, lead to higher government spending, endanger international
competitiveness and invite chaos in financial markets.
   Moreover, he continues, the nation's budget deficit already is
shrinking, and a balanced budget can still be achieved without
raising taxes. In fact, he says, economic expansion is the only sure
way to reduce the deficit.
   But tax increases, he contends, have the opposite impact: They
limit economic growth by undermining the climate for saving and
investing.
   ``Every tax drains money from the private marketplace to
government programs,'' he points out. Taxes impose on the private
sector a complexity of regulations and paperwork. They draw
sustenance from capital formation.
   Seldom, he suggests, are taxes just. By his reckoning, the
median-income family of four did not pay a cent of income taxes in
1948; now their tax bill is almost $2,700. Increases, he says, can
only mean that such families become more dependent on government
services, which of course are financed by taxes.
   There is a pernicious aspect _ at least one _ to tax increases.
The one chosen by Humbert is this: ``Increasing tax revenues relieve
the pressure for budget cuts and usually result in higher spending.''
   In defense of this claim, he cites as evidence a study conducted
for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, which estimated that
for every dollar of tax increases in postwar America, spending was
raised by $1.52.
   Besides, he continues, a tax increase now constitutes poor
timing. A global economy is developing, and that means competition
for markets among all industrial powers. High taxes, he suggests,
could make us less competitive.
   But, you may respond, we must close the gap between budget
expenditures and revenues. Humbert's immediate response is that the
gap already is growing smaller. But, important as it is, the gap may
be getting too much attention.
   He suggests that our attention is similar to that of eyeing the
hole rather than the doughnut. What's more important than the
deficit in any one year, he says, is the accumulation of debt.
   In that regard, he calls attention to the fact that in 1946 the
national debt amounted to 120 percent of gross national product, and
almost 50 percent in 1959. Today, he says, the percentage is down to
43, and falling.
   Besides, he continues, a tax increase isn't needed to balance the
budget. In his view, a 4 percent growth in federal expenditures and
continued economic expansion would bring the budget into balance by
1993.
   Finally, he contends that a tax increase would signal financial
markets that American policy-makers were returning to the days of
the 1970s when, Humbert asserts, ``capital formation and investment
were almost destroyed by the twin forces of inflation and
tax-induced stagnation.''
   What is his recipe for success?
   A big job: Sweeping back the tide and sending it the other way
with ``tax rate reductions that encourage risk-taking for
entrepreneurs, small business people, and innovators _ the people
who generate the most jobs in our economy.''

<HEAD>Soybean Edict Brings Bronx Cheer From Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade says it averted a crisis but the
exchange faces a chorus of criticism after forcing a selloff of
soybean futures.
   The biggest boos are coming from farmers, who ended up on the
losing end of the dizzying drop in soybean prices precipitated by
the exchange's emergency order. Soybeans for July delivery settled
Friday at $7.03{ a bushel, 22{ cents below the settlement price on
Tuesday before the exchange issued its directive, and 63 cents below
the previous Friday's final price.
   ``They feel they've been betrayed by the exchange,'' said James
Merritt, research director for Merchants Trading Co., a Chicago
futures brokerage with a large farmer clientele.
   Some of the Board of Trade's own members _ many of them pure
speculators who make their living forecasting the movements of the
free market _ also feel cheated by the edict.
   Regardless of whether the Italian concern Ferruzzi Finanziara SpA
was trying to corner the soybean market, critics say, directors of
the exchange should have let the market sort itself out.
   But the Board of Trade says that would have been even more
troublesome, that with too few soybeans of acceptable quality
available to satisfy outstanding contracts, there would have been
defaults and chaos in the marketplace.
   The exchange says it is only doing its government-authorized job
of ensuring order in a market of global importance, thereby
protecting the public's interest. A federal judge in Chicago agreed
on Thursday by denying Ferruzzi's bid to block the Board of Trade's
directive.
   ``If I grant a temporary restraining order in this case and it
turns out to be a mistake ... a loss of confidence in the market
could be a consequence,'' said U.S. District Judge James Zagel.
   An investigation appears to be inevitable. And the century-old
debate revived by the flap _ whether agricultural futures markets
are legitimate marketing tools or gambling casinos _ will rage on.
   That's nothing new for the Chicago Board of Trade. The 141-year
history of the world's oldest and largest futures exchange is strewn
with scandals, squeezes, corners and attempts to crush them.
   When the dust clears, predicts Merton Miller, a University of
Chicago finance professor and an expert on futures markets, the
Board of Trade will still be standing.
   ``A lot of people may not like it but, as the saying goes, it's
the only wheel in town,'' he said. ``If you're in the soybean
business, what else are you going to do?''

<HEAD>Profit Reports Stand As Next Hurdle for Rising Stock Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street analysts are waiting with some
trepidation for the second-quarter earnings reports due to be issued
by hundreds of companies over the next few weeks.
   The profit figures are expected to provide some of the first
hard-and-fast signs of the impact a slowing economy is likely to
have on businesses' bottom lines.
   By all the evidence so far, the Federal Reserve's efforts to
restrain economic growth began to take hold in earnest in the
April-June period.
   Investors have had ample chance to brace themselves lately for
the likelihood that earnings reports aren't going to be as
impressive as they have been over the past couple of years.
   To cite a prominent example among the industries whose earnings
are closely tied to the business cycle, auto stocks have been weak
for some time as it became increasingly apparent that cars and truck
sales were slumping.
   Still, many observers wonder how well prepared the market, which
hit new highs this past week since the 1987 crash, might be for any
significant and widespread earnings setbacks.
   ``In this cycle, stocks may have waited to fall in the face of
earnings disappointments, rather than in anticipation of them,''
said Edward Kerschner at PaineWebber Inc.
   The question goes beyond whether results for the second quarter
itself measure up to expectations.
   If profit growth has indeed passed its peak and is starting down,
many analysts will be scrutinizing the current figures to try to
gauge how much they should revise projections for the third quarter
and beyond.
   ``We expect that modest disappointments in the cyclical
industries will evoke major earnings estimate reductions,'' said
John Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``Analysts will seize the
opportunity to get their estimates down at this very convenient
juncture.
   ``Of greatest interest will be the reaction of cyclical stock
prices,'' Connolly added. ``At best they will be neutral (compared
with) the general market. The other possibility is that they could
tumble.''
   Such talk didn't deter investors from bidding enthusiastically
for stocks in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 66.96 to 2,554.82, on top of a 47.80-point gain the week
before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.50 to 185.06;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
6.48 to 448.90, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 4.37 at 368.12.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 160.26 million shares a day, up
from 125.86 million a day in the previous week.
   Corporate earnings reports for the next few quarters may well
turn out to be a deciding factor in the debate over Wall Street's
popular ``soft landing'' hypothesis.
   Believers in this script argue that the Federal Reserve will be
able to slow growth and restrain inflation without causing a
recession and an accompanying slide in business profits. But
skeptics still regard that as a difficult mission.
   ``We think chances are that this soft landing will run into a
hard rock,'' said Suresh Bhirud at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``We were
hoping we'd see 5 percent earnings growth next year, but we've had
to reduce that estimate.''
   At Merrill Lynch, chief economist Donald Straszheim still
projects 5 percent increases in earnings for both this year and
next. But he notes that that will contrast sharply with the gains of
20 percent and 35 percent recorded in the past two years.
   ``Aftertax operating profits, adjusted for inventory and
depreciation considerations, are likely to be flat at best over the
next two years,'' Straszheim said. ``Slower economic growth is
squeezing profits.''

<HEAD>BAT Megabid Could Transform Euro-Takeover Scene</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic in AP Access under BRITTAKES</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Look out, Europe. The debt-financed megabid craze
in America has thundered across the Atlantic with a vengeance in the
form of a hostile $21 billion offer for leading conglomerate BAT
Industries PLC, shattering an assumption that the biggest European
businesses are immune from attack.
   Regardless of whether Anglo-French financier Sir James
Goldsmith's investor group succeeds in its offer for the British
company, the bid has rewritten the rules and could incite a spree of
multbillion dollar deals.
   ``It has sent shivers down the spines of the chief executives of
many of our companies,'' says Philip Healey, editor of the British
publication Acquisitions Monthly.
   Nonetheless, such large takeovers financed with borrowed money
face considerable obstacles in Britain and elsewhere in Europe,
where the buying and selling of companies historically has been much
more conservative and slow-moving than in the United States.
   Most high-profile American deals have taken the form of a
leveraged buyout, in which a would-be buyer puts up almost no cash
but borrows the purchase price, pledging the target company's assets
as collateral. After the deal is completed, the new owner sells off
pieces of the company to repay the debt.
   Many European investors have doubts about following the U.S.
buyout trend. They are less keen on borrowingly heavily, tend to be
more loyal to companies and are more sensitive about post-takeover
job losses.
   Yet, said Johnathan Mervis, chief executive of J.P. Mervis Ltd.,
an acquisitions adviser, ``Time has moved on and the opposition is
not quite as firm as it was.''
   The announcement last Tuesday of the BAT bid, which nearly rivals
the record $25 billion purchase of RJR Nabisco Inc. earlier this
year, means that ``in the British takeover scene, the perception has
been totally changed. This has really changed the whole ball game,''
Healey said in an interview.
   ``If they are going to take pot shots at BAT, who else is safe?''
he said. ``There are very few companies safe.''
   Europe's economy already has been influenced by an acceleration
in takeovers, spurred partly by the perception that many companies
are undervalued, particularly since the October 1987 stock market
crash.
   The approach of 1992, when Europe becomes a trade-barrier free
marketplace of 320 million consumers, also has played a role in the
increased number of corporate mergers. Many company strategists see
acquisitions as a good way to prepare for an onslaught of
competition from inside and outside Europe.
   In addition, a generation of postwar entrepreneurs are now
approaching retirement. Many are looking for buyers because their
own children aren't interested in running the family business.
   Britain is Europe's busiest takeover battlefield _ the number of
British deals has quadrupled in the past five years _ because there
are more publicly held companies and bidders face fewer corporate
defenses and regulatory hurdles than in other European countries.
   Indeed, Goldsmith chose Britain after becoming disenchanted with
the United States, where competition among dealmakers has squeezed
returns and where the most obvious takeover targets have been
plucked.
   According to Acquisitions Monthly, a record 2,241 takeovers of
British companies worth 37.6 billion pounds or $61.3 billion were
completed last year, vs. 1,937 deals worth 27.7 billion pounds or
$45.2 billion in 1987.
   Prices soared on London's Stock Exchange this past week on
expectations that other British corporate giants would become
targets now that the ground has been broken. Shares in other
European bourses also jumped.
   Many British investment strategists say takeover activity has
become a strong underpinning for the London market.
   ``A lot of people now are seeing the low value of some of our
very large and very successful companies,'' Healey said.
   But others question whether a bonanza for takeover investors is
imminent in Britain.
   ``I'm not sure that will happen,'' said Mervis. ``I think that it
will all settle down.''
   Analysts doubted the Goldsmith group could woo BAT's large-scale
shareholders with a bid that is 80 percent debt-financed.
   ``The institutional investors are very hostile to such bids,''
Healey said.
   BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy described the offer as ``an
ill-conceived attempt at destructive financial engineering.''
   The bidders, who also include British merchant banker Jacob
Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer, will have to
pay a higher price and include some cash to win, analysts said.
   Goldsmith has said he wants to dismantle BAT by selling off its
non-tobacco interests, which include financial services, retailing
and paper. But many Europeans fear that breaking up companies can
worsen Europe's relatively high unemployment.
   ``Will chief executives be more worried about takeovers than
running their companies?'' said Healey. He expressed concern that
takeover paranoia could make corporate bosses change basic strategy
to the detriment of their companies' long-term futures. For example,
they might spend or borrow huge sums to repurchase stock instead
using the money for research and investment.
   ``What might come out later is the political backlash,'' Healey
said. ``Is this good for Great Britain PLC?''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, although a strong
supporter of free market forces, has blocked big takeovers in the
past, including the Australian company Elders IXL Ltd.'s bid for
liquor company Allied-Lyons PLC.
   But one of two rival bids for Gateway Corp., a large supermarket
operator, is expected to succeed.
   The British takeover scene has attracted many American
participants, including leveraged buyout leader Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts and Co., the takeover strategist firm Wasserstein, Perella
and Co., and speculator Asher Edelman.
   In the BAT battle, the Goldsmith group has lined up Bankers Trust
Co. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to help finance its offer, and
BAT has enlisted Goldman Sachs and Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. for a defensive response.

   BAT and Batman were at the center of two
multibillion-dollar takeover deals that took shape on opposite sides
of the Atlantic, one in the City of London and the other in Gotham
City.
   Overseas, a group led by British raider Sir James Goldsmith made
a $21.2 billion debt-financed hostile foray for BAT Industries PLC,
a conglomerate that owns the swank Saks Fifth Avenue chain and makes
Kool cigarettes.
   The offer, which affirms the migration of the American big buyout
to Europe, would amount to the second-largest deal in history behind
the $25 billion debt-financed takeover of RJR Nabisco Corp. earlier
this year.
   But if the recent history of American hostile takeovers is any
indication, this deal will go the way of all others: to court.
   That's where the protracted tussle over the future of New
York-based giants Time Inc., Paramount Communications Corp. and
Warner Communications Inc. is mired, and a judge on Friday helped
clear some of the sludge.
   Ruling on the side of Time's friendly $14 billion offer for
Warner _ the entertainment empire reaping big profits from its
``Batman'' film hit _ Delaware Chancery Court Judge William T. Allen
scuttled for now Paramount's hostile $12.2 billion offer for Time.
   The judge refused to block Time's $70-a-share offer. Paramount,
though, appealed the ruling to the state supreme court in Delaware,
where all three companies are incorporated.
   In Britain, BAT and its pursuer, a trio of powerful investors led
by Goldsmith, were lining up attorneys for what promises to be a
legal extravaganza.
   Since many BAT subsidiaries are American, the takeover could be
decided in U.S. courts. Earlier this year, a federal judge
effectively ended South Africa-controlled Minorco SA's bid for
Britain's Consolidated Gold Fields PLC by issuing a retraining order
against the acquisition.
   Besides highly paid investment bankers, the BAT offering would
bring two other popular American financial tools to Europe: the use
of high-yield junk bonds and the dismemberment of a large company.
   No caped crusader he, Goldsmith says he wants to bust up BAT by
selling its non-tobacco interests, which account for about 60
percent of its annual revenue of $28.7 billion. In America, those
interests include Saks, Marshall Field, Appleton Papers and Farmers
Group Inc., one of the nation's largest insurers.
   While the takeover gulf between Europe and the United States
appears to be narrowing, there's no denying the enormous economic
gap between East and West reflected in the BAT and Time capers.
   As the two deals went their respective routes _ Time in court,
BAT heading there _ President Bush was behind the Iron Curtain
offering Poland $100 million in aid, a figure that probably won't
approach the fees for lawyers and investment bankers in the takeover
bids.
   In other business news this week:
   _One of Chicago's commodities exchanges was back in the public
eye but the reason was soybeans, not FBI surveillance. The Chicago
Board of Trade issued an emergency order to curb trading in soybean
futures contracts amid rumors an Italian company was trying to
corner the market. A federal judge upheld the order but the Italians
said they will sue to recover losses.
   _More evidence emerged that the economy is contracting. Wholesale
prices fell 0.1 percent in June, the first drop in 18 months, retail
sales fell for the second straight month and the operating rate for
U.S. factories declined, government reports showed.
   _Leaders of the world's seven richest democracies gathered in
Paris during the bicentennial of the French Revolution for their
annual economic summit. President Bush won one victory in a trade
dispute but was thwarted in an attempt to engineer a deal to lower
Mexico's debt.

<HEAD>SEC Proposing Changes with World Market In Mind</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A proposed rule change in an obscure aspect of
U.S. securities law signals that federal regulators are ready to go
global.
   As the drive toward automated trading and internationally linked
markets accelerates, the Securities and Exchange Commission has
decided to proceed _ in a toned down version _ with a proposal that
would make it easier for U.S. and foreign corporations to raise
money through the private sale of securities.
   It's called Rule 144a, and although SEC officials and industry
experts concede it won't have much direct effect on the average
American, it has generated an enormous amount of interest in the
financial community and press.
   ``I used to call it `The Satanic Verses' of the securities
industry,'' said Sara Hanks, an SEC official in Washington. First
proposed last October, Rule 144a _ like the controversial Salman
Rushdie novel _ remained obscure to all but devotees until it was
publicly attacked and turned into a hot news story. ``We got some
very inflammatory headlines,'' she said.
   Supporters said it would lower financing costs for U.S. companies
while enticing foreign corporations, previously discouraged by SEC
registration and disclosure requirements, to raise capital here.
   But critics claimed the rule change would increase the power of
large institutional investors, like banks and insurance companies,
by eroding the already shrinking public securities markets where
investors, big and small, are considered equal.
   That private market has mushroomed from $16 billion or nearly 22
percent of the total securities market in 1980 to about $200 billion
or almost 43 percent last year, according to IDD Information
Services, a firm that tracks trends in the financial industry.
   After some etooling following input from the securities industry
and stock exchange officials, the SEC voted 5-0 last week to seek
additional comment on Rule 144a.
   The modified version was one of five proposals cleared by the SEC
last week addressing problems raised by the globalization of
financial markets, which has made it easy to trade U.S. stocks in
Singapore and British stocks in New York.
   ``International markets are increasingly automated and
interlinked,'' SEC Chairman David S. Ruder told a Senate
subcommittee hearing on globalization last month.
   ``As dramatically illustrated by the October 1987 market break
(the SEC's term for the stock market crash), events in one country's
securities markets may affect those in other countries.''
   Rule 144a, if approved by the SEC, would loosen restraints on the
trading in the private placement market, securities that are
exempted from SEC registration requirements because they are not
offered publicly.
   The attraction to private offerings is ``as much a question of
convenience as anything else,'' said Geoff Vincent, an associate at
IDD Information Services.
   Paperwork for a public offering takes a minimum of two weeks
after it gets to the SEC, he explained, while in a private offering
``you cut out the whole formality of registering with the SEC. There
has to be some savings on printing expenses and legal costs.''
   But there's a catch. While companies can sell their securities to
large investors without the lengthy and expensive disclosure and
registration proceedings required in public offerings, the purchaser
must hold them for two to three years. That restriction has made
privately placed securities unattractive to many large investors,
forcing issuers to sell at a discount.
   Rule 144a would create a ``safe harbor'' from the resale
restriction.
   ``What we're doing here is providing a more liquid market, making
it more efficient so it's easier to resell them,'' said Ms. Hanks,
chief of the SEC's Office of International Corporate Finance.
   In response to earlier comments by top officials from major
corporations and investment institutions, the SEC staff recommended
changes in its initial proposal.
   They included narrowing the number of institutions allowed to
participate and barring securities that already are publicly traded
from the registration exemption.
   ``From what we've read about it, we think its better than the
last rule, but whether it's something we completely support, I can't
say yet,'' said Kenneth Leibler, president of the American Stock
Exchange.
   Ms. Hanks noted that the Securities Act of 1933, which Rule 144a
would modify slightly, was aimed at protecting investors.
   ``Our role is to protect investors when they need protecting,''
she said. ``There was clear intent by Congress that there are some
people who just don't need our protection, the large institutional
investors who can fend for themselves.''
   Gene Finn, chief economist for the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which oversees over-the-counter stock dealers,
agreed that ``large institutions don't need the protections built
into many SEC requirements.''
   Finn and Edward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry
Association, agreed that the change wouldn't hurt small investors
although it favors large institutional investors such as banks,
mutual funds and insurance companies.
   ``Little guys invest through these investment funds which are
large investors,'' said Finn, adding that the change will ``lower
the costs of those financial services. That will indirectly benefit
individual investors.''
   ``I don't think it (Rule 144a) is going to impinge on the rights
of individual investors because it will not necessarilly create a
market that will interfere with them,'' O'Brien said.
